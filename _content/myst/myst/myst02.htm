<p><A NAME="an_ii-p1"></A>  <A NAME="an_ii-p1.1"></A>This book falls naturally into two parts; each of which is really complete  in itself, though they are in a sense complementary to one another.  Whilst the second and longest part contains a somewhat detailed study  of the nature and development of man&#8217;s spiritual or mystical  consciousness, the first is intended rather to provide an introduction  to the general subject of mysticism. Exhibiting it by turns from the  point of view of metaphysics, psychology, and symbolism, it is an  attempt to gather between the covers of one volume information at  present scattered amongst many monographs and text-books written in  divers tongues, and to give the student in a compact form at least the  elementary facts in regard to each of those subjects which are most  closely connected with the study of the mystics.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_ii-p2"></A>Those mystics, properly speaking, can only be studied  in their works: works which are for the most part left unread by those  who now talk much about mysticism. Certainly the general reader has  this excuse, that the masterpieces of mystical literature, full of  strange beauties though they be, offer considerable difficulties to  those who come to them unprepared. In the first seven chapters of this  book I have tried to remove a few of these difficulties; to provide  the necessary preparation; and to exhibit the relation in which  mysticism stands to other forms of life. If, then, the readers of this  section are enabled by it to come to the encounter of mystical  literature with a greater power of sympathetic comprehension than they  previously possessed, it will have served the purpose for which it has  been composed.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_ii-p3"></A>It is probable that almost every such reader,  according to the angle from which he approaches the subject, will here  find a good deal which seems to him superfluous. But different types  of mind will find this unnecessary elaboration in different places.  The psychologist, approaching from the scientific standpoint, eager  for morbid phenomena, has little use for disquisitions on symbolism,  religious or other. The symbolist, approaching from the artistic  standpoint, seldom admires the proceedings of psychology. I believe,  however, that none who wish to obtain an idea of mysticism in its  wholeness, as a form of life, can afford <a name="page_xx"><font size="1" color="green">p. xx</font></A> <A NAME="an_ii-Page_xx"></A>  to neglect any of the aspects on which these pages venture to touch.  The metaphysician and the psychologist are unwise if they do not  consider the light thrown upon the ideas of the mystics by their  attitude towards orthodox theology. The theologian is still more  unwise if he refuse to hear the evidence of psychology. For the  benefit of those whose interest in mysticism is chiefly literary, and  who may care to be provided with a clue to the symbolic and  allegorical element in the writings of the contemplatives, a short  section on those symbols of which they most often make use has been  added. Finally, the persistence amongst us of the false opinion which  confuses mysticism with occult philosophy and psychic phenomena, has  made it necessary to deal with the vital distinction which exists  between it and every form of magic.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_ii-p4"></A>Specialists in any of these great departments of  knowledge will probably be disgusted by the elementary and superficial  manner in which their specific sciences are here treated. But this  book does not venture to address itself to specialists. From those who  are already fully conversant with the matters touched upon, it asks  the indulgence which really kindhearted adults are always ready to  extend towards the efforts of youth. Philosophers are earnestly  advised to pass over the first two chapters, and theologians to  practise the same charity in respect of the section dealing with their  science.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_ii-p5"></A>The giving of merely historical information is no part  of the present plan: except in so far as chronology has a bearing upon  the most fascinating of all histories, the history of the spirit of  man. Many books upon mysticism have been based on the historical  method: amongst them two such very different works as Vaughan&#8217;s  supercilious and unworthy &#8220;Hours with the Mystics&#8221; and Dr.  Inge&#8217;s scholarly Bampton lectures. It is a method which seems to  be open to some objection: since mysticism avowedly deals with the  individual not as he stands in relation to the civilization of his  time, but as he stands in relation to truths that are timeless. All  mystics, said Saint-Martin, speak the same language and come from the  same country. As against that fact, the place which they happen to  occupy in the kingdom of this world matters little. Nevertheless,  those who are unfamiliar with the history of mysticism properly so  called, and to whom the names of the great contemplatives convey no  accurate suggestion of period or nationality, may be glad to have a  short statement of their order in time and distribution in space.  Also, some knowledge of the genealogy of mysticism is desirable if we  are to distinguish the original contributions of each individual from  the mass of speculation and statement which he inherits <a name="page_xxi"><font size="1" color="green">p. xxi</font></A> <A NAME="an_ii-Page_xxi"></A> from the past. Those entirely unacquainted  with these matters may find it helpful to glance at the Appendix  before proceeding to the body of the work; since few things are more  disagreeable than the constant encounter of persons to whom we have  not been introduced.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_ii-p6"></A>The second part of the book, for which the first seven  chapters are intended to provide a preparation, is avowedly  psychological. It is an attempt to set out and justify a definite  theory of the nature of man&#8217;s mystical consciousness: the  necessary stages of organic growth through which the typical mystic  passes, the state of equilibrium towards which he tends. Each of these  stages&#8212;and also the characteristically mystical and still  largely mysterious experiences of visions and voices, contemplation  and ecstasy&#8212;though viewed from the standpoint of psychology, is  illustrated from the lives of the mystics; and where possible in their  own words. In planning these chapters I have been considerably helped  by M. Delacroix&#8217;s brilliant &#8220;Etudes sur le  Mysticisme,&#8221; though unable to accept his conclusions: and here  gladly take the opportunity of acknowledging my debt to him and also  to Baron von H&uuml;gel&#8217;s classic &#8220;Mystical Element of  Religion.&#8221; This book, which only came into my hands when my own  was planned and partly written, has since been a constant source of  stimulus and encouragement.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_ii-p7"></A>Finally, it is perhaps well to say something as to the  exact sense in which the term &#8220;mysticism&#8221; is here  understood. One of the most abused words in the English language, it  has been used in different and often mutually exclusive senses by  religion, poetry, and philosophy: has been claimed as an excuse for  every kind of occultism, for dilute transcendentalism, vapid  symbolism, religious or aesthetic sentimentality, and bad metaphysics.  On the other hand, it has been freely employed as a term of contempt  by those who have criticized these things. It is much to be hoped that  it may be restored sooner or later to its old meaning, as the science  or art of the spiritual life.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_ii-p8"></A>Meanwhile, those who use the term  &#8220;Mysticism&#8221; are bound in self-defence to explain what they  mean by it. Broadly speaking, I understand it to be the expression of  the innate tendency of the human spirit towards complete harmony with  the transcendental order; whatever be the theological formula under  which that order is understood. This tendency, in great mystics,  gradually captures the whole field of consciousness; it dominates  their life and, in the experience called &#8220;mystic union,&#8221;  attains its end. Whether that end be called the God of Christianity,  the World-soul of Pantheism, the Absolute of Philosophy, the desire to  attain it and the movement towards it&#8212;so long as this is a  genuine <a name="page_xxii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xxii</font></A> <A NAME="an_ii-Page_xxii"></A> life process and not an  intellectual speculation&#8212;is the proper subject of mysticism. I  believe this movement to represent the true line of development of the  highest form of human consciousness.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_ii-p9"></A>It is a pleasant duty to offer my heartiest thanks to  the many kind friends and fellow students, of all shades of opinion,  who have given me their help and encouragement. Amongst those to whom  my heaviest debt of gratitude is due are Mr. W. Scott Palmer, for much  valuable, generous, and painstaking assistance, particularly in  respect of the chapter upon Vitalism: and Miss Margaret Robinson, who  in addition to many other kind offices, has made all the translations  from Meister Eckhart and Mechthild of Magdeburg here given.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_ii-p10"></A>Sections of the MS. have been kindly read by the Rev.  Dr. Inge, by Miss May Sinclair, and by Miss Eleanor Gregory; from all  of whom I have received much helpful and expert advice. To Mr. Arthur  Symons my thanks and those of my readers are specially due; since it  is owing to his generous permission that I am able to make full use of  his beautiful translations of the poems of St. John of the Cross.  Others who have given me much help in various directions, and to whom  most grateful acknowledgments are here offered, are Miss Constance  Jones, Miss Ethel Barker, Mr. J. A. Herbert of the British  Museum&#8212;who first brought to my notice the newly discovered  &#8220;Mirror of Simple Souls&#8221;&#8212;the Rev. Dr. Arbuthnot  Nairn, Mr. A. E. Waite, and Mr. H. Stuart Moore, F.S.A. The substance  of two chapters&#8212;those upon &#8220;The Characteristics of  Mysticism&#8221; and &#8220;Mysticism and Magic&#8221;&#8212;has  already appeared in the pages of   <i>The Quest</i>    and   <i>The Fortnightly Review.</i>    These sections are here reprinted by kind permission of their  respective editors.</p>
