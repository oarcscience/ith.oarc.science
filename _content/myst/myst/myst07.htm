<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p1"></A>The<A NAME="an_iii.iv-p1.1"></A> spiritual history of man reveals two distinct and fundamental  attitudes towards the unseen; and two methods whereby he has sought to  get in touch with it. For our present purpose I will call these  methods the &#8220;way of magic&#8221; and the &#8220;way of  mysticism.&#8221; Having said this, we must at once add that although  in their extreme forms these methods are sharply contrasted, their  frontiers are far from being clearly defined: that, starting from the  same point, they often confuse the inquirer by using the same  language, instruments, and methods. Hence, much which is really magic  is loosely and popularly described as mysticism. They represent as a  matter of fact the opposite poles of the same thing: the  transcendental consciousness of humanity. Between them lie the great  religions, which might be described under this metaphor as  representing the ordinarily habitable regions of that consciousness.  Thus, at one end of the scale, pure mysticism &#8220;shades off&#8221;  into religion&#8212;from some points of view seems to grow out of it.  No deeply religious man is without a touch of mysticism; and no mystic  can be other than religious, in the psychological if not in the  theological sense of the word. At the other end of the scale, as we  shall see later, religion, no less surely, shades off into magic.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p2"></A>The fundamental difference between the two is this:  magic wants to get, mysticism wants to give&#8212;immortal and  antagonistic attitudes, which turn up under one disguise or another in  <a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_71"></A> every age of thought. Both magic and  mysticism in their full development bring the whole mental machinery,  conscious and unconscious, to bear on their undertaking: both claim  that they give their initiates powers unknown to ordinary men. But the  centre round which that machinery is grouped, the reasons of that  undertaking, and the ends to which those powers are applied differ  enormously. In mysticism the will is united with the emotions in an  impassioned desire to transcend the sense-world, in order that the  self may be joined by love to the one eternal and ultimate Object of  love; whose existence is intuitively perceived by that which we used  to call the soul, but now find it easier to refer to as the  &#8220;cosmic&#8221; or &#8220;transcendental&#8221; sense. This is  the poetic and religious temperament acting upon the plane of reality.  In magic, the will unites with the intellect in an impassioned desire  for supersensible knowledge. This is the intellectual, aggressive, and  scientific temperament trying to extend its field of consciousness,  until it includes the supersensual world: obviously the antithesis of  mysticism, though often adopting its title and style.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p3"></A>It will be our business later to consider in more  detail the characteristics and significance of magic. Now it is enough  to say that we may class broadly as magical all forms of self-seeking  transcendentalism. It matters little whether the apparatus which they  use be the incantations of the old magicians, the congregational  prayer for rain of orthodox Churchmen, or the consciously  self-hypnotizing devices of &#8220;New Thought&#8221;: whether the end  proposed be the evocation of an angel, the power of transcending  circumstance, or the healing of disease. The object is always the  same: the deliberate exaltation of the will, till it transcends its  usual limitations and obtains for the self or group of selves  something which it or they did not previously possess. It is an  individualistic and acquisitive science: in all its forms an activity  of the intellect, seeking Reality for its own purposes, or for those  of humanity at large.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p4"></A>Mysticism, whose great name is too often given to  these supersensual activities, has nothing in common with this. It is  non-individualistic. It implies, indeed, the abolition of  individuality; of that hard separateness, that &#8220;I, Me,  Mine&#8221; which makes of man a finite isolated thing. It is  essentially a movement of the heart, seeking to transcend the  limitations of the individual standpoint and to surrender itself to  ultimate Reality; for no personal gain, to satisfy no transcendental  curiosity, to obtain no other-worldly joys, but purely from an  instinct of love. By the word   <i>heart,</i>    of course we here mean not merely &#8220;the seat of the  affections,&#8221; &#8220;the organ of tender emotion,&#8221; and the  like: but rather the inmost sanctuary of personal being, the deep root  of <a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_72"></A> its love and will, the very source of  its energy and life. The mystic is &#8220;in love with the  Absolute&#8221; not in any idle or sentimental manner, but in that  vital sense which presses at all costs and through all dangers towards  union with the object beloved. Hence, whilst the practice of  magic&#8212;like the practice of science&#8212;does not necessarily  entail passionate emotion, though of course it does and must entail  interest of some kind, mysticism, like art, cannot exist without it.  We must feel, and feel acutely, before we want to act on this hard and  heroic scale.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p5"></A>We see, then, that these two activities correspond to  the two eternal passions of the self, the desire of love and the  desire of knowledge: severally representing the hunger of heart and  intellect for ultimate truth. The third attitude towards the  supersensual world, that of transcendental philosophy, hardly comes  within the scope of the present inquiry; since it is purely academic,  whilst both magic and mysticism are practical and empirical. Such  philosophy is often wrongly called mysticism, because it tries to make  maps of the countries which the mystic explores. Its performances are  useful, as diagrams are useful, so long as they do not ape finality;  remembering that the only final thing is personal experience&#8212;the  personal and costly exploration of the exalted and truth-loving  soul.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p6"></A>What then do we really mean by mysticism? A word which  is impartially applied to the performances of mediums and the  ecstasies of the saints, to &#8220;menticulture&#8221; and sorcery,  dreamy poetry and mediaeval art, to prayer and palmistry, the  doctrinal excesses of Gnosticism, and the tepid speculations of the  Cambridge Platonists&#8212;even, according to William James, to the  higher branches of intoxication  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">111</FONT></A>
   &#8212;soon ceases to have any useful meaning. Its employment merely  confuses the inexperienced student, who ends with a vague idea that  every kind of supersensual theory and practice is somehow  &#8220;mystical.&#8221; Hence the need of fixing, if possible, its  true characteristics: and restating the fact that Mysticism, in its  pure form, is the science of ultimates, the science of union with the  Absolute, and nothing else, and that the mystic is the person who  attains to this union, not the person who talks about it. Not to   <i>know about</i>    but to   <i>Be,</i>    is the mark of the real initiate.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p8"></A>The difficulty lies in determining the point at which  supersensual experience ceases to be merely a practical and  interesting extension of sensual experience&#8212;an enlarging, so to  speak, of the boundaries of existence&#8212;and passes over into that  boundless life where Subject and Object, desirous and desired, are   <i>one.</i>    No <a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="green">p. 73</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_73"></A> sharp line, but rather an infinite  series of gradations separate the two states. Hence we must look  carefully at all the pilgrims on the road; discover, if we can, the  motive of their travels, the maps which they use, the luggage which  they take, the end which they attain.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p9"></A>Now we have said that the end which the mystic sets  before him is conscious union with a living Absolute. That Divine  Dark, that Abyss of the Godhead, of which he sometimes speaks as the  goal of his quest, is just this Absolute, the Uncreated Light in which  the Universe is bathed, and which&#8212;transcending, as it does, all  human powers of expression&#8212;he can only describe to us as   <i>dark.</i>    But there is&#8212;must be&#8212;contact &#8220;in an intelligible  where&#8221; between every individual self and this Supreme Self, this  Ultimate. In the mystic this union is conscious, personal, and  complete. &#8220;He enjoys,&#8221; says St. John of the Cross,  &#8220;a certain contact of the soul with the Divinity; and it is God  Himself who is then felt and tasted.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A>
    More or less according to his measure, he has touched&#8212;or  better, been touched by&#8212;the substantial Being of Deity, not  merely its manifestation in life. This it is which distinguishes him  from the best and most brilliant of other men, and makes his science,  in Patmore&#8217;s words, &#8220;the science of self-evident  Reality.&#8221; Gazing with him into that unsearchable ground whence  the World of Becoming comes forth &#8220;eternally generated in an  eternal Now,&#8221; we may see only the icy darkness of perpetual  negations: but he, beyond the coincidence of opposites, looks upon the  face of Perfect Love.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p11"></A>As genius in any of the arts is&#8212;humanly  speaking&#8212;the final term of a power of which each individual  possesses the rudiments, so mysticism may be looked upon as the final  term, the active expression, of a power latent in the whole race: the  power, that is to say, of so perceiving transcendent reality. Few  people pass through life without knowing what it is to be at least  touched by this mystical feeling. He who falls in love with a woman  and perceives&#8212;as the lover really does perceive&#8212;that the  categorical term &#8220;girl&#8221; veils a wondrous and unspeakable  reality: he who, falling in love with nature, sees the landscape  &#8220;touched with light divine,&#8221;&#8212;a charming phrase to  those who have not seen it, but a scientific statement to the  rest&#8212;he who falls in love with the Holy, or as we say  &#8220;undergoes conversion&#8221;: all these have truly known for an  instant something of the secret of the world.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A>
 </p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p12.1"></A> &#8220;. . . Ever and anon a trumpet sounds<br>   From the hid battlement of Eternity,<br>   Those shaken mists a space unsettle, then<br>   Round the half-glimps&egrave;d turrets slowly wash  again.&#8221;<br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p13"></A><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_74"></A> At such moments  &#8220;Transcendental Feeling, welling up from another &#8216;Part of  the Soul&#8217; whispers to Understanding and Sense that they are  leaving out something. What? Nothing less than the secret plan of the  Universe. And what is that secret plan? The other &#8216;Part of the  Soul&#8217; indeed comprehends it in silence as it is, but can explain  it to the Understanding only in the symbolical language of the  interpreter, Imagination&#8212;in Vision.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p15"></A>Here, in this spark or &#8220;part of the soul&#8221;  where the spirit, as religion says, &#8220;rests in God who made  it,&#8221; is the fountain alike of the creative imagination and the  mystic life. Now and again something stings it into consciousness, and  man is caught up to the spiritual level, catches a glimpse of the  &#8220;secret plan.&#8221; Then hints of a marvellous truth, a unity  whose note is ineffable peace, shine in created things; awakening in  the self a sentiment of love, adoration, and awe. Its life is  enhanced, the barrier of personality is broken, man escapes the  sense-world, ascends to the apex of his spirit, and enters for a brief  period into the more extended life of the All.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p16"></A>This intuition of the Real lying at the root of the  visible world and sustaining its life, is present in a modified form  in the arts: perhaps it were better to say,   <i>must</i>    be present if these arts are so justify themselves as heightened  forms of experience. It is this which gives to them that peculiar  vitality, that strange power of communicating a poignant emotion, half  torment and half joy, which baffle their more rational interpreters.  We know that the picture which is &#8220;like a photograph,&#8221; the  building which is at once handsome and commodious, the novel which is  a perfect transcript of life, fail to satisfy us. It is difficult to  say why this should be so, unless it were because these things have  neglected their true business; which was not to reproduce the  illusions of ordinary men but to catch and translate for us something  of that &#8220;secret plan,&#8221; that reality which the artistic  consciousness is able, in a measure, to perceive. &#8220;Painting as  well as music and poetry exists and exults in immortal  thoughts,&#8221; says Blake.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A>
    That &#8220;life-enhancing power&#8221; which has been recognized as  the supreme quality of good painting,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A>
    has its origin in this contact of the artistic mind with the  archetypal&#8212;or, if you like, the transcendental&#8212;world: the  underlying verity of things.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p19"></A>A critic, in whom poetic genius has brought about the  unusual alliance of intuition with scholarship, testifies to this same  truth when he says of the ideals which governed early Chinese  painting, &#8220;In this theory every work of art is thought of as an  incarnation <a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_75"></A> of the genius of rhythm,  manifesting the living spirit of things with a clearer beauty and  intenser power than the gross impediments of complex matter allow to  be transmitted to, our senses in the visible world around us. A  picture is conceived as a   <i>sort of apparition from a more real world of essential  life.&#8221;</i>   &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p21"></A>That &#8220;more real world of essential life&#8221;  is the world in which the &#8220;free soul&#8221; of the great mystic  dwells; hovering like the six-winged seraph before the face of the  Absolute.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A>
    The artist too may cross its boundaries in his brief moments of  creation: but he cannot stay. He comes back to us, bearing its  tidings, with Dante&#8217;s cry upon his lips&#8212;</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p22.1"></A> &#8220;. . . Non eran da  ci&ograve; le proprie penne<br>   se non che la mia mente fu percossa<br>   da un fulgore, in che sua voglia  venne.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p24"></A>The mystic may say&#8212;is indeed bound to  say&#8212;with St. Bernard, &#8220;My secret to myself.&#8221; Try how  he will, his stammering and awestruck reports can hardly be understood  but by those who are already in the way. But the artist cannot act  thus. On him has been laid the duty of expressing something of that  which he perceives. He is bound to tell his love. In his worship of  Perfect Beauty faith must be balanced by works. By means of veils and  symbols he must interpret his free vision, his glimpse of the burning  bush, to other men. He is the mediator between his brethren and the  divine, for art is the link between appearance and reality.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p26"></A>But we do not call every one who has these partial and  artistic intuitions of reality a mystic, any more than we call every  one a musician who has learnt to play the piano. The true mystic is  the person in whom such powers transcend the merely artistic and  visionary stage, and are exalted to the point of genius: in whom the  transcendental consciousness can dominate the normal consciousness,  and who has definitely surrendered himself to the embrace of Reality.  As artists stand in a peculiar relation to the phenomenal world,  receiving rhythms and discovering truths and beauties which are hidden  from other men, so this true mystic stands in a peculiar relation to  the transcendental world, there experiencing actual, but to us  unimaginable tension and delight. His consciousness is transfigured in  a particular way, he lives at <a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_76"></A> different  levels of experience from other people: and this of course means that  he sees a different world, since the world as we know it is the  product of certain scraps or aspects of reality acting upon a normal  and untransfigured consciousness. Hence his mysticism is no isolated  vision, no fugitive glimpse of reality, but a complete system of life  carrying its own guarantees and obligations. As other men are immersed  in and react to natural or intellectual life, so the mystic is  immersed in and reacts to spiritual life. He moves towards that utter  identification with its interests which he calls &#8220;Union with  God.&#8221; He has been called a lonely soul. He might more properly  be described as a lonely body: for his soul, peculiarly responsive,  sends out and receives communications upon every side.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p27"></A>The earthly artist, because perception brings with it  the imperative longing for expression, tries to give us in colour,  sound or words a hint of his ecstasy, his glimpse of truth. Only those  who have tried, know how small a fraction of his vision he can, under  the most favourable circumstance, contrive to represent. The mystic,  too, tries very hard to tell an unwilling world his secret. But in his  case, the difficulties are enormously increased. First, there is the  huge disparity between his unspeakable experience and the language  which will most nearly suggest it. Next, there is the great gulf fixed  between his mind and the mind of the world. His audience must be  bewitched as well as addressed, caught up to something of his state,  before they can be made to understand.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p28"></A>Were he a musician, it is probable that the mystic  could give his message to other musicians in the terms of that art,  far more accurately than language will allow him to do: for we must  remember that there is no excuse but that of convenience for the  pre-eminence amongst modes of expression which we accord to words.  These correspond so well to the physical plane and its adventures,  that we forget that they have but the faintest of relations with  transcendental things. Even the artist, before he can make use of  them, is bound to re-arrange them in accordance with the laws of  rhythm: obeying unconsciously the rule by which all arts &#8220;tend  to approach the condition of music.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p29"></A>So too the mystic. Mysticism, the most romantic of  adventures, from one point of view the art of arts, their source and  also their end, finds naturally enough its closest correspondences in  the most purely artistic and most deeply significant of all forms of  expression. The mystery of music is seldom realized by those who so  easily accept its gifts. Yet of all the arts music alone shares with  great mystical literature the power of waking in us a response to the  life-movement of the universe: brings us&#8212;we know not  how&#8212;news of its exultant passions and its incomparable peace.  <a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_77"></A> Beethoven heard the very voice of  Reality, and little of it escaped when he translated it for our ears.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p31"></A>The mediaeval mind, more naturally mystical than ours,  and therefore more sharply aware of the part which rhythmic harmony  plays in the worlds of nature and of grace, gave to music a cosmic  importance, discerning its operation in many phenomena which we now  attribute to that dismal figment, Law. &#8220;There are three kinds of  music,&#8221; says Hugh of St. Victor, &#8220;the music of the worlds,  the music of humanity, the music of instruments. Of the music of the  worlds, one is of the elements, another of the planets, another of  Time. Of that which is of the elements, one is of number, another of  weights, another of measure. Of that which is of the planets, one is  of place, another of motion, another of nature. Of that which is of  Time, one is of the days and the vicissitudes of light and darkness;  another of the months and the waxing and waning of the moon; another  of the years and the changes of spring, summer, autumn and winter. Of  the music of humanity, one is of the body, another of the soul,  another in the connexion that is between them.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A>
    Thus the life of the visible and invisible universe consists in a  supernal fugue.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p33"></A>One contemplative at least, Richard Rolle of Hampole,  &#8220;the father of English mysticism,&#8221; was acutely aware of  this music of the soul, discerning in it a correspondence with the  measured harmonies of the spiritual universe. In those enraptured  descriptions of his inward experience which are among the jewels of  mystical literature, nothing is more remarkable than his constant and  deliberate employment of musical imagery. This alone, it seems, could  catch and translate for him the character of his experience of  Reality. The condition of joyous and awakened love to which the mystic  passes when his purification is at an end is to him, above all else,  the state of Song. He does not &#8220;see&#8221; the spiritual world:  he &#8220;hears&#8221; it. For him, as for St. Francis of Assisi, it  is a &#8220;heavenly melody, intolerably sweet.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p35"></A>&#8220;Song I call,&#8221; he says, &#8220;when in a  plenteous soul the sweetness of eternal love with burning is taken,  and thought into song is turned, and the mind into full sweet sound is  changed.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A>
    He who <a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_78"></A> experiences this joyous  exaltation &#8220;says not his prayers like other righteous men&#8221;  but &#8220;is taken into marvellous mirth: and, goodly sound being  descended into him, as it were with notes his prayers he sings.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A>
    So Gertrude More&#8212;&#8220;O lett me sitt alone, silent to all the  world and it to me, that I may learn the song of Love.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p39"></A>Rolle&#8217;s own experience of mystic joy seems  actually to have come to him in this form: the perceptions of his  exalted consciousness presenting themselves to his understanding under  musical conditions, as other mystics have received them in the form of  pictures or words. I give in his own words the classic description of  his passage from the first state of &#8220;burning love&#8221; to the  second state of &#8220;songful love&#8221;&#8212;from   <i>Calor</i>    to   <i>Canor&#8212;</i>   when &#8220;into song of joy meditation is turned.&#8221; &#8220;In  the night, before supper, as I my psalms sung, as it were the sound of  readers or rather singers about me I beheld. Whilst, also praying, to  heaven with all desire I took heed, suddenly, in what manner I wot  not, in me the sound of song I felt; and likeliest heavenly melody I  took, with me dwelling in mind. Forsooth my thought continually to  mirth of song was changed, and my meditation to praise turned; and my  prayers and psalm-saying, in   <i>sound</i>    I showed.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p41"></A>The song, however, is a mystic melody having little in  common with its clumsy image, earthly music. Bodily song &#8220;lets  it&#8221;; and &#8220;noise of janglers makes it turn again to  thought,&#8221; &#8220;for sweet ghostly song accords not with outward  song, the which in churches and elsewhere is used. It discords much:  for all that is man&#8217;s voice is formed with bodily ears to be  heard; but among angels&#8217; tunes it has an acceptable melody, and  with marvel it is commended of them that have known it.&#8221; To  others it is incommunicable. &#8220;Worldly lovers soothly words or  ditties of our song may know, for the words they read: but the tone  and sweetness of that song they may not learn.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p46"></A>Such symbolism as this&#8212;a living symbolism of  experience and action, as well as of statement&#8212;seems almost  essential to mystical expression. The mind must employ some device of  the kind if its transcendental perceptions&#8212;wholly unrelated as  they are to the phenomena with which intellect is able to  deal&#8212;are ever to be grasped by the surface consciousness.  Sometimes the symbol and the perception which it represents become  fused in that consciousness; and the mystic&#8217;s experience then  presents itself to <a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_79"></A> him as  &#8220;visions&#8221; or &#8220;voices&#8221; which we must look upon  as the garment he has himself provided to veil that Reality upon which  no man may look and live. The nature of this garment will be largely  conditioned by his temperament&#8212;as in Rolle&#8217;s evident bias  towards music, St. Catherine of Genoa&#8217;s leaning towards the  abstract conceptions of fire and light&#8212;and also by his  theological education and environment. Cases in point are the highly  dogmatic visions and auditions of St. Gertrude, Suso, St. Catherine of  Siena, the Blessed Angela of Foligno; above all of St. Teresa, whose  marvellous self-analyses provide the classic account of these attempts  of the mind to translate transcendental intuitions into concepts with  which it can deal.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p47"></A>The greatest mystics, however&#8212;Ruysbroeck, St.  John of the Cross, and St. Teresa herself in her later  stages&#8212;distinguish clearly between the ineffable Reality which  they perceive and the image under which they describe it. Again and  again they tell us with Dionysius and Eckhart, that the Object of  their contemplation &#8220;hath no image&#8221;: or with St. John of  the Cross that &#8220;the soul can never attain to the height of the  divine union, so far as it is possible in this life, through the  medium of any forms or figures.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>
    Therefore the attempt which has sometimes been made to identify  mysticism with such forms and figures&#8212;with visions, voices,  &#8220;supernatural favours&#8221; and other abnormal  phenomena&#8212;is clearly wrong.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p49"></A>&#8220;The highest and most divine things which it is  given us to see and to know,&#8221; says Dionysius the Areopagite  plainly, &#8220;are but the symbolic language of things subordinate to  Him who Himself transcendeth them all: through which things His  incomprehensible Presence is shown, walking on those heights of His  Holy Places which are perceived by the mind.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p51"></A>The mystic, as a rule, cannot wholly do without symbol  and image, inadequate to his vision though they must always be: for  his experience must be expressed if it is to be communicated, and its  actuality is inexpressible except in some side-long way, some hint or  parallel which will stimulate the dormant intuition of the reader, and  convey, as all poetic language does, something beyond its surface  sense. Hence the large part which is played in all mystical writings  by symbolism and imagery; and also by that rhythmic and exalted  language which induces in sensitive persons something of the languid  ecstasy of dream. The close connection between rhythm and heightened  states of consciousness is as yet little understood. Its further  investigation will probably throw much light on ontological as well as  psychological problems. <a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_80"></A> Mystical, no  less than musical and poetic perception, tends naturally&#8212;we know  not why&#8212;to present itself in rhythmical periods: a feature which  is also strongly marked in writings obtained in the automatic state.  So constant is this law in some subjects that Baron von H&uuml;gel  adopted the presence or absence of rhythm as a test whereby to  distinguish the genuine utterances of St. Catherine of Genoa from  those wrongly attributed to her by successive editors of her legend.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">131</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p53"></A>All kinds of symbolic language come naturally to the  articulate mystic, who is often a literary artist as well: so  naturally, that he sometimes forgets to explain that his utterance is  but symbolic&#8212;a desperate attempt to translate the truth of that  world into the beauty of this. It is here that mysticism joins hands  with music and poetry: had this fact always been recognized by its  critics, they would have been saved from many regrettable and some  ludicrous misconceptions. Symbol&#8212;the clothing which the  spiritual borrows from the material plane&#8212;is a form of artistic  expression. That is to say, it is not literal but suggestive: though  the artist who uses it may sometimes lose sight of this distinction.  Hence the persons who imagine that the &#8220;Spiritual  Marriage&#8221; of St. Catherine or St. Teresa veils a perverted  sexuality, that the vision of the Sacred Heart involved an incredible  anatomical experience, or that the divine inebriation of the Sufis is  the apotheosis of drunkenness, do but advertise their ignorance of the  mechanism of the arts: like the lady who thought that Blake   <i>must</i>    be mad because he said that he had touched the sky with his  finger.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p54"></A>Further, the study of the mystics, the keeping company  however humbly with their minds, brings with it as music or poetry  does&#8212;but in a far greater degree&#8212;a strange exhilaration,  as if we were brought near to some mighty source of Being, were at  last on the verge of the secret which all seek. The symbols displayed,  the actual words employed, when we analyse them, are not enough to  account for such effect. It is rather that these messages from the  waking transcendental self of another, stir our own deeper selves in  their sleep. It were hardly an extravagance to say, that those  writings which are the outcome of true and first-hand mystical  experience may be known by this power of imparting to the reader the  sense of exalted and extended life. &#8220;All mystics,&#8221; says  Saint-Martin, &#8220;speak the same language, for they come from the  same country.&#8221; The deep undying life within us came from that  country too: and it recognizes the accents of home, though it cannot  always understand what they would say.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p55"></A>Now, returning to our original undertaking, that of  defining <a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_81"></A> if we can the characteristics  of true mysticism, I think that we have already reached a point at  which William James&#8217;s celebrated &#8220;four marks&#8221; of the  mystic state, Ineffability, Noetic Quality, Transiency, and Passivity,  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">132</FONT></A>
    will fail to satisfy us. In their place I propose to set out,  illustrate and, I hope, justify four other rules or notes which may be  applied as tests to any given case which claims to take rank amongst  the mystics.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p57"></A>1. True mysticism is active and practical, not passive  and theoretical. It is an organic life-process, a something which the  whole self does; not something as to which its intellect holds an  opinion.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p58"></A>2. Its aims are wholly transcendental and spiritual.  It is in no way concerned with adding to, exploring, re-arranging, or  improving anything in the visible universe. The mystic brushes aside  that universe, even in its supernormal manifestations. Though he does  not, as his enemies declare, neglect his duty to the many, his heart  is always set upon the changeless One.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p59"></A>3. This One is for the mystic, not merely the Reality  of all that is, but also a living and personal Object of Love; never  an object of exploration. It draws his whole being homeward, but  always under the guidance of the heart.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p60"></A>4. Living union with this One&#8212;which is the term  of his adventure&#8212;is a definite state or form of enhanced life.  It is obtained neither from an intellectual realization of its  delights, nor from the most acute emotional longings. Though these  must be present they are not enough. It is arrived at by an arduous  psychological and spiritual process&#8212;the so-called Mystic  Way&#8212;entailing the complete remaking of character and the  liberation of a new, or rather latent, form of consciousness; which  imposes on the self the condition which is sometimes inaccurately  called &#8220;ecstasy,&#8221; but is better named the Unitive  State.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p61"></A>Mysticism, then, is not an opinion: it is not a  philosophy. It has nothing in common with the pursuit of occult  knowledge. On the one hand it is not merely the power of contemplating  Eternity: on the other, it is not to be identified with any kind of  religious queerness. It is the name of that organic process which  involves the perfect consummation of the Love of God: the achievement  here and now of the immortal heritage of man. Or, if you like it  better&#8212;for this means exactly the same thing&#8212;it is the art  of establishing his conscious relation with the Absolute.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p62"></A>The movement of the mystic consciousness towards this  consummation, is not merely the sudden admission to an overwhelming  vision of Truth: though such dazzling glimpses may from time to time  be vouchsafed to the soul. It is rather an ordered movement <a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_82"></A> towards ever higher levels of reality, ever  closer identification with the Infinite. &#8220;The mystic  experience,&#8221; says R&eacute;c&eacute;jac, &#8220;ends with the words,  &#8216;I live, yet not I, but God in me.&#8217; This feeling of  identification, which is the term of mystical activity, has a very  important significance. In its early stages the mystic consciousness  feels the Absolute in opposition to the Self . . . as mystic activity  goes on, it tends to abolish this opposition. . . . When it has  reached its term the consciousness finds itself possessed by the sense  of a Being at one and the same time greater than the Self and  identical with it: great enough to be God, intimate enough to be  me.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p64"></A>This is that mystic union which is the only possible  fulfilment of mystic love: since</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p64.1"></A> &#8220;All that is not One must ever<br>   Suffer with the wound of Absence<br>   And whoever in Love&#8217;s city<br>   Enters, finds but room for One<br>   And but in One-ness, Union.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p66"></A>The history of mysticism is the history of the  demonstration of this law upon the plane of reality.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p67"></A>Now, how do these statements square with the practice  of the great mystics; and with the various forms of activity which  have been classified at one time or another as mystical?</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p68"></A>(1)   <i>Mysticism is practical, not theoretical.</i> </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p69"></A>This statement, taken alone, is not, of course, enough  to identify mysticism; since it is equally true of magic, which also  proposes to itself something to be done rather than something to be  believed. It at once comes into collision, however, with the opinions  of those who believe mysticism to be &#8220;the reaction of the born  Platonist upon religion.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p70"></A>The difference between such devout philosophers and  the true mystic, is the difference which George Tyrrell held to  distinguish revelation from theology.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">135</FONT></A>
    Mysticism, like revelation, is final and personal. It is not merely a  beautiful and suggestive diagram but experience in its most intense  form. That experience, in the words of Plotinus, is the soul&#8217;s  solitary adventure: &#8220;the flight of the Alone to the  Alone.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A>
    It provides the material, the substance, upon which mystical  philosophy cogitates; as theologians cogitate upon the revelation  which forms the basis of faith. Hence those whom we are to accept as  mystics must have received, and acted upon, intuitions of a Truth  which is for them absolute. If we are <a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_83"></A> to  acknowledge that they &#8220;knew the doctrine&#8221; they must have  &#8220;lived the life&#8221;; submitted to the interior travail of the  Mystic Way, not merely have reasoned about the mystical experiences of  others. We could not well dispense with our Christian Platonists and  mystical philosophers. They are our stepping-stones to higher things;  interpret to our dull minds, entangled in the sense-world, the ardent  vision of those who speak to us from the dimension of Reality. But  they are no more mystics than the milestones on the Dover Road are  travellers to Calais. Sometimes their words&#8212;the wistful words of  those who know but cannot be&#8212;produce mystics; as the sudden  sight of a signpost pointing to the sea will rouse the spirit of  adventure in a boy. Also there are many instances of true mystics,  such as Eckhart, who have philosophized upon their own experiences,  greatly to the advantage of the world; and others&#8212;Plotinus is  the most characteristic example&#8212;of Platonic philosophers who  have passed far beyond the limits of their own philosophy, and  abandoned the making of diagrams for an experience, however imperfect,  of the reality at which these diagrams hint. It were more accurate to  reverse the epigram above stated, and say, that Platonism is the  reaction of the intellectualist upon mystical truth.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p73"></A>Over and over again the great mystics tell us, not how  they speculated, but how they acted. To them, the transition from the  life of sense to the life of spirit is a formidable undertaking, which  demands effort and constancy. The paradoxical &#8220;quiet&#8221; of  the contemplative is but the outward stillness essential to inward  work. Their favourite symbols are those of action: battle, search, and  pilgrimage.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p73.1"></A> &#8220;In an obscure night<br>   Fevered with love&#8217;s anxiety<br>   (O hapless, happy plight!)<br>   I   <i>went</i>   , none seeing me<br>   Forth from my house, where all things quiet  be,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">137</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p75"></A>said St. John of the Cross, in his poem of the  mystic quest.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p76"></A>&#8220;It became evident to me,&#8221; says Al  Ghazzali of his own search for mystic truth, &#8220;that the Sufis are  men of intuition and not men of words. I recognized that I had learnt  all that can be learnt of Sufiism by study, and that the rest could  not be learnt by study or by speech.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A>
    &#8220;Let no one suppose,&#8221; says the &#8220;Theologia  Germanica,&#8221; &#8220;that we may attain to this true light and  perfect knowledge . . . by hearsay, or by reading and study, nor yet  by high skill and great learning.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A>
    &#8220;It is not enough,&#8221; says Gerlac <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_84"></A> Petersen, &#8220;to know by estimation merely:  but we must know by experience.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A>
    So Mechthild of Magdeburg says of her revelations, &#8220;The writing  of this book was seen, heard, and experienced in every limb. . . . I  see it with the eyes of my soul, and hear it with the ears of my  eternal spirit.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p81"></A>Those who suppose mystical experience to be merely a  pleasing consciousness of the Divine in the world, a sense of the  &#8220;otherness&#8221; of things, a basking in the beams of the  Uncreated Light, are only playing with Reality. True mystical  achievement is the most complete and most difficult expression of life  which is as yet possible to man. It is at once an act of love, an act  of surrender, and an act of supreme perception; a trinity of  experiences which meets and satisfies the three activities of the  self. Religion might give us the first and metaphysics the third of  these processes. Only Mysticism can offer the middle term of the  series; the essential link which binds the three in one.  &#8220;Secrets,&#8221; says St. Catherine of Siena, &#8220;are  revealed to a friend who has become one thing with his friend and not  to a servant.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p83"></A>(2)   <i>Mysticism is an entirely Spiritual Activity.</i> </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p84"></A>This rule provides us with a further limitation, which  of course excludes all the practisers of magic and of magical  religion: even in their most exalted and least materialistic forms. As  we shall see when we come to consider these persons, their  object&#8212;not necessarily an illegitimate one&#8212;is to improve  and elucidate the visible by help of the invisible: to use the  supernormal powers of the self for the increase of power, virtue,  happiness or knowledge. The mystic never turns back on himself in this  way, or tries to combine the advantages of two worlds. At the term of  his development he knows God by communion, and this direct intuition  of the Absolute kills all lesser cravings. He possesses God, and needs  nothing more. Though he will spend himself unceasingly for other men,  become &#8220;an agent of the Eternal Goodness,&#8221; he is destitute  of supersensual ambitions and craves no occult knowledge or power.  Having his eyes set on eternity, his consciousness steeped in it, he  can well afford to tolerate the entanglements of time. &#8220;His  spirit,&#8221; says Tauler, &#8220;is as it were sunk and lost in the  Abyss of the Deity, and loses the consciousness of all  creature-distinctions. All things are gathered together in one with  the divine sweetness, and the man&#8217;s being is so penetrated with  the divine substance that he loses himself therein, as a drop of water  is lost in a cask of strong wine. And thus the man&#8217;s spirit is  so sunk in God in divine union, that he loses all sense of distinction  . . . <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_85"></A> and there remains a secret, still  union, without cloud or colour.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A>
    &#8220;I wish not,&#8221; said St. Catherine of Genoa, &#8220;for  anything that comes forth from Thee, but only for Thee, oh sweetest  Love!&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A>
    &#8220;Whatever share of this world,&#8221; says Rabi&#8217;a,  &#8220;Thou dost bestow on me, bestow it on Thine enemies, and  whatever share of the next world thou dost give me, give it to Thy  friends. Thou art enough for me!&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">145</FONT></A>
    &#8220;The Soul,&#8221; says Plotinus in one of his most profound  passages, &#8220;having now arrived at the desired end, and  participating of Deity, will know that the Supplier of true life is  then present. She will likewise then require nothing farther; for, on  the contrary it will be requisite to lay aside other things, to stop  in this alone, amputating everything else with which she is  surrounded.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">146</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p89"></A>(3)   <i>The business and method of Mysticism is Love.</i> </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p90"></A>Here is one of the distinctive notes of true  mysticism; marking it off from every other kind of transcendental  theory and practice and providing the answer to the question with  which our last chapter closed. It is the eager, outgoing activity  whose driving power is generous love, not the absorbent, indrawing  activity which strives only for new knowledge, that is fruitful in the  spiritual as well as in the physical world.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p91"></A>Having said this, however, we must add&#8212;as we did  when speaking of the &#8220;heart&#8221;&#8212;that the word Love as  applied to the mystics is to be understood in its deepest, fullest  sense; as the ultimate expression of the self&#8217;s most vital  tendencies, not as the superficial affection or emotion often  dignified by this name. Mystic Love is a total dedication of the will;  the deep-seated desire and tendency of the soul towards its Source. It  is a condition of humble access, a life-movement of the self: more  direct in its methods, more valid in its results&#8212;even in the  hands of the least lettered of its adepts&#8212;than the most piercing  intellectual vision of the greatest philosophic mind. Again and again  the mystics insist upon this. &#8220;For silence is not God, nor  speaking is not God; fasting is not God nor eating is not God;  onliness is not God nor company is not God; nor yet any of all the  other two such quantities, He is hid between them, and may not be  found by any work of thy soul, but all only by love of thine heart. He  may not be known by reason, He may not be gotten by thought, nor  concluded by understanding; but he may be loved and chosen with the  true lovely will of thine heart. . . . Such a blind shot with the  sharp dart of longing love may never fail of the prick, the which is  God.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">147</FONT></A>
    <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_86"></A></p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p93"></A>&#8220;&#8216;Come down quickly,&#8217;&#8221; says  the Incomprehensible Godhead to the soul that has struggled like  Zaccheus to the topmost branches of the theological tree,  &#8220;&#8216;for I would dwell with you to-day.&#8217; And this hasty  descent to which he is summoned by God is simply a descent by love and  desire in to that abyss of the Godhead which the intellect cannot  understand. But where intelligence must rest without, love and desire  can enter in.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">148</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p95"></A>Volumes of extracts might be compiled from the works  of the mystics illustrative of this rule, which is indeed their  central principle. &#8220;Some there are,&#8221; says Plotinus,  &#8220;that for all their effort have not attained the Vision; the  soul in them has come to no sense of the splendour there. It has not  taken warmth; it has not felt burning within itself the flame of love  for what is there to know.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">149</FONT></A>
    &#8220;Love,&#8221; says Rolle, &#8220;truly suffers not a loving  soul to bide in itself, but ravishes it out to the Lover, that the  soul is more there where it loves, than where the body is that lives  and feels it.&#8221; &#8220;Oh singular joy of love  everlasting,&#8221; he says again, &#8220;that ravishes all his to  heavens above all worlds, them binding with bands of virtue! Oh dear  charity, in earth that has thee not is nought wrought, whatever it  hath! He truly in thee that is busy, to joy above earthly is soon  lifted! Thou makest men contemplative, heaven-gate thou openest,  mouths of accusers thou dost shut, God thou makest to be seen and  multitude of sins thou hidest. We praise thee, we preach thee, by thee  the world we quickly overcome, by whom we joy and the heavenly ladder  we ascend.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">150</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p98"></A>Love to the mystic, then, is (a) the active, conative,  expression of his will and desire for the Absolute; (b) his innate  tendency to that Absolute, his spiritual weight. He is only thoroughly  natural, thoroughly alive, when he is obeying its voice. For him it is  the source of joy, the secret of the universe, the vivifying principle  of things. In the words of R&eacute;c&eacute;jac, &#8220;Mysticism claims  to be able to know the Unknowable without any help from dialectics;  and believes that, by the way of love and will it reaches a point to  which thought alone is unable to attain.&#8221; Again, &#8220;It is  the heart and never the reason which leads us to the Absolute.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">151</FONT></A>
    Hence in St. Catherine of Siena&#8217;s exquisite allegory it is the  feet of the soul&#8217;s affection which brings it first to the  Bridge, &#8220;for the feet carry the body as affection carries the  soul.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">152</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p101"></A>The jewels of mystical literature glow with this  intimate and impassioned love of the Absolute; which transcends the  dogmatic language in which it is clothed and becomes applicable to  mystics of every race and creed. There is little difference in this  between <a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_87"></A> the extremes of Eastern and  Western thought: between A Kempis the Christian and Jalalu &#8216;d  Din the Moslem saint.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p102"></A>&#8220;How great a thing is Love, great above all  other goods: for alone it makes all that is heavy light, and bears  evenly all that is uneven. . . .</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p103"></A>&#8220;Love would be aloft, nor will it be kept back  by any lower thing. Love would be free, and estranged from all worldly  affection, that its inward sight be not hindered: that it may not be  entangled by any temporal comfort, nor succumb to any tribulation.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p104"></A>&#8220;Nought is sweeter than love, nought stronger,  nought higher, nought wider: there is no more joyous, fuller, better  thing in heaven or earth. For love is born of God, and cannot rest  save in God, above all created things.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p105"></A>&#8220;The lover flies, runs, and, rejoices: he is  free, and cannot be restrained. He gives all for all, and has all in  all; for he rests in One Supreme above all, from whom all good flows  and proceeds.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p106"></A>&#8220;He looks not at the gift, but above all goods  turns himself to the giver.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p107"></A>&#8220;. . . He who loves knows the cry of this voice.  For this burning affection of the soul is a loud cry in the ears of  God when it saith &#8216;My God, My Love, Thou art all mine, and I am  all Thine.&#8217;&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">153</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p109"></A>So much for the Christian. Now for the Persian  mystic.</p>   <blockquote><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p109.1"></A> &#8220;While the thought of the Beloved fills our  hearts<br>   All our work is to do Him service and spend life for  Him.<br>   Wherever He kindles His destructive torch<br>   Myriads of lovers&#8217; souls are burnt  therewith.<br>   The lovers who dwell within the sanctuary<br>   Are moths burnt with the torch of the Beloved&#8217;s  face.<br>   O heart, hasten thither! for God will shine upon  you,<br>   And seem to you a sweet garden instead of a  terror.<br>   He will infuse into your soul a new soul,<br>   So as to fill you, like a goblet, with wine.<br>   Take up your abode in His Soul!<br>   Take up your abode in heaven, oh bright full  moon!<br>   Like the heavenly Scribe, He will open your  heart&#8217;s book<br>   That he may reveal mysteries unto you.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">154</FONT></A>
  <br>  </blockquote>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p111"></A>Well might Hilton say that &#8220;Perfect love maketh  God and the soul to be as if they both together were but one  thing,&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">155</FONT></A>
    and Tauler that &#8220;the well of life is love, and he who dwelleth  not in love is dead.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">156</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p114"></A>These, nevertheless, are objective and didactic  utterances; though their substance may be&#8212;probably  is&#8212;personal, their form is not. But if we want to see what it  really means to be &#8220;in love <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="green">p. 88</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_88"></A> with  the Absolute,&#8221;&#8212;how intensely actual to the mystic is the  Object of his passion, how far removed from the spheres of pious duty  or philosophic speculation, how concrete, positive and dominant such a  passion may be&#8212;we must study the literature of autobiography,  not that of poetry or exhortation. I choose for this purpose, rather  than the well-known self-analyses of St. Augustine, St. Teresa or  Suso, which are accessible to every one, the more private confessions  of that remarkable mystic Dame Gertrude More, contained in her  &#8220;Spiritual Exercises.&#8221;</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p115"></A>This nun, great-great-granddaughter of Sir Thomas  More, and favourite pupil of the celebrated Benedictine contemplative,  the Ven. Augustine Baker, exhibits the romantic and personal side of  mysticism more perfectly than even St. Teresa, whose works were  composed for her daughters&#8217; edification. She was an eager  student of St. Augustine, &#8220;my deere deere Saint,&#8221; as she  calls him more than once. He had evidently influenced her language;  but her passion is her own.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p116"></A>Remember that Gertrude More&#8217;s confessions  represent the most secret conversations of her soul with God. They  were not meant for publication; but, written for the most part on  blank leaves in her breviary, were discovered and published after her  death. &#8220;She called them,&#8221; says the title-page with  touching simplicity, <A NAME="an_iii.iv-p116.1"></A>&#8220;  <i>Amor ordinem nescit:</i>     an Ideot&#8217;s Devotions. Her only spiritual  father and directour, Father Baker, styled them   <i>Confessiones Amantis,</i>    A Lover&#8217;s Confessions. <A NAME="an_iii.iv-p116.2"></A>  <i>Amans Deum anima sub Deo despicit universa.</i>     A soul that loveth God despiseth all things that be  inferiour unto God.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">157</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p118"></A>The spirit of her little book is summed up in two  epigrams: epigrams of which her contemporary, Crashaw, might have been  proud. &#8220;To give all for love is a most sweet bargain.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">158</FONT></A>
    &#8220;O let me love, or not live!&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">159</FONT></A>
    Love indeed was her life: and she writes of it with a rapture which  recalls at one moment the exuberant poetry of Jacopene da Todi, at  another the love songs of the Elizabethan poets.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p121"></A>&#8220;Never was there or can there be imagined such a  Love, as is between an humble soul and thee. Who can express what  passeth between such a soul and thee? Verily neither man nor Angell is  able to do it sufficiently. . . . In thy prayse I am only happy, in  which, my Joy, I will exult with all that love thee. For what can be a  comfort while I live separated from thee, but only to remember that my  God, who is more myne than I am my owne, is absolutely and infinitely  happy? . . . Out of this true love between a <a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_89"></A> soul and thee, there ariseth such a knowledge  in the soul that it loatheth all that is an impediment to her further  proceeding in the Love of thee. O Love, Love, even by naming thee, my  soul loseth itself in thee. . . . Nothing can Satiate a reasonable  soul but only thou: and having of thee, who art indeed all, nothing  could be said to be wanting to her. . . .   <i>Blessed are the cleans of hart for they shall see God.</i>    O sight to be wished, desired, and longed for; because once to have  seen thee is to have learnt all things. Nothing can bring us to this  sight but love. But what love must it be? not a sensible love only, a  childish love, a love which seeketh itself more than the beloved. No,  no, but it must be an ardent love, a pure love, a courageous love, a  love of charity, an humble love, and a constant love, not worn out  with labours, not daunted with any difficulties. . . . For that soul  that hath set her whole love and desire on thee, can never find any  true satisfaction, but only in thee.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">160</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p123"></A>Who will not see that we have here no literary  exercise, but the fruits of an experience of peculiar intensity? It  answers exactly to one of the best modern definitions of mysticism as  &#8220;in essence, the concentration of all the forces of the soul  upon a supernatural Object, conceived and loved as a living  Person.&#8220;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">161</FONT></A>
    &#8220;Love and desire,&#8221; says the same critic, &#8220;are the  fundamental necessities; and where they are absent man, even though he  be a visionary, cannot be called a mystic.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">162</FONT></A>
    Such a definition, of course, is not complete. It is valuable  however, because it emphasizes the fact that all true mysticism is  rooted in personality; and is therefore fundamentally a science of the  heart.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p126"></A>Attraction, desire, and union as the fulfilment of  desire; this is the way Life works, in the highest as in the lowest  things. The mystic&#8217;s outlook, indeed, is the lover&#8217;s  outlook. It has the same element of wildness, the same quality of  selfless and quixotic devotion, the same combination of rapture and  humility. This parallel is more than a pretty fancy: for mystic and  lover, upon different planes, are alike responding to the call of the  Spirit of Life. The language of human passion is tepid and  insignificant beside the language in which the mystics try to tell the  splendours of their love. They force upon the unprejudiced reader the  conviction that they are dealing with an ardour far more burning for  an Object far more real.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p127"></A>&#8220;This monk can give lessons to lovers!&#8221;  exclaimed Arthur Symons in astonishment of St. John of the Cross.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">163</FONT></A>
    It would be strange if he could not; since their finite passions are  but the feeble images of his infinite one, their beloved the imperfect  symbol of <a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_90"></A> his First and only Fair.  &#8220;I saw Him and sought Him: I had Him and I wanted Him,&#8221;  says Julian of Norwich, in a phrase which seems to sum up all the  ecstasy and longing of man&#8217;s soul. Only this mystic passion can  lead us from our prison. Its brother, the desire of knowledge, may  enlarge and improve the premises to an extent as yet undreamed of: but  it can never unlock the doors.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p129"></A>(4)   <i>Mysticism entails a definite Psychological Experience.</i> </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p130"></A>That is to say, it shows itself not merely as an  attitude of mind and heart, but as a form of organic life. It is not  only a theory of the intellect or a hunger, however passionate, of the  heart. It involves the organizing of the whole self, conscious and  unconscious, under the spur of such a hunger: a remaking of the whole  character on high levels in the interests of the transcendental life.  The mystics are emphatic in their statement that spiritual desires are  useless unless they initiate this costly movement of the whole self  towards the Real.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p131"></A>Thus in the visions of Mechthild of Magdeburg,  &#8220;The soul spake thus to her Desire, &#8216;Fare forth and see  where my Love is. Say to him that I desire to love.&#8217; So Desire  sped forth, for she is quick of her nature, and came to the Empyrean  and cried, &#8216;Great Lord, open and let me in!&#8217; Then said the  Householder of that place: &#8216;What means this fiery  eagerness?&#8217; Desire replied, &#8216;Lord I would have thee know  that my lady can no longer bear to live. If Thou wouldst flow forth to  her, then might she swim: but the fish cannot long exist that is left  stranded on the shore.&#8217; &#8216;Go back,&#8217; said the Lord,  &#8216;I will not let thee in unless thou bring to me that hungry  soul, for it is in this alone that I take delight.&#8217;&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">164</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p133"></A>We have said  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">165</FONT></A>
    that the full mystic consciousness is extended in two distinct  directions. So too there are two distinct sides to the full mystical  experience. (A) The vision or consciousness of Absolute Perfection.  (B) The inward transmutation to which that Vision compels the mystic,  in order that he may be to some extent worthy of that which he has  beheld: may take his place within the order of Reality. He has seen  the Perfect; he wants to be perfect too. The &#8220;third term,&#8221;  the necessary bridge between the Absolute and the Self, can only, he  feels, be moral and spiritual transcendence&#8212;in a word,   <i>Sanctity&#8212;</i>   for &#8220;the only means of attaining the Absolute lies in adapting  ourselves to It.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">166</FONT></A>
    The moral virtues are for him, then, the obligatory &#8220;ornaments  of the Spiritual Marriage&#8221; as Ruysbroeck called them: though far  more than their presence is needed to bring that marriage about.  Unless this impulse for moral perfection be born in him, this travail  of the inner life begun, he <a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_91"></A> is no  mystic: though he may well be a visionary, a prophet, a  &#8220;mystical&#8221; poet.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p136"></A>Moreover, this process of transmutation, this  rebuilding of the self on higher levels, will involve the  establishment within the field of consciousness, the making  &#8220;central for life,&#8221; of those subconscious spiritual  perceptions which are the primary material of mystical experience. The  end and object of this &#8220;inward alchemy&#8221; will be the  raising of the whole self to the condition in which conscious and  permanent union with the Absolute takes place and man, ascending to  the summit of his manhood, enters into that greater life for which he  was made. In its journey towards this union, the subject commonly  passes through certain well-marked phases, which constitute what is  known as the &#8220;Mystic Way.&#8221; This statement rules out from  the true mystic kingdom all merely sentimental and affective piety and  visionary poetry, no less than mystical philosophy. It brings us back  to our first proposition&#8212;the concrete and practical nature of  the mystical act.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p137"></A>More than the apprehension of God, then, more than the  passion for the Absolute, is needed to make a mystic. These must be  combined with an appropriate psychological make-up, with a nature  capable of extraordinary concentration, an exalted moral emotion, a  nervous organization of the artistic type. All these are necessary to  the successful development of the mystic life process. In the  experience of those mystics who have left us the records of their own  lives, the successive stages of this life process are always  traceable. In the second part of this book, they will be found worked  out at some length. Rolle, Suso, St. Teresa, and many others have left  us valuable self-analyses for comparison: and from them we see how  arduous, how definite, and how far removed from mere emotional or  intellectual activity, is that educational discipline by which  &#8220;the eye which looks upon Eternity&#8221; is able to come to its  own. &#8220;One of the marks of the true mystic,&#8221; says  Leuba&#8212;by no means a favourable witness&#8212;&#8220;is the  tenacious and heroic energy with which he pursues a definite moral  ideal.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">167</FONT></A>
    &#8220;He is,&#8221; says Pacheu, &#8220;the pilgrim of an inward  Odyssey.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">168</FONT></A>
    Though we may be amazed and delighted by his adventures and  discoveries on the way, to him the voyage and the end are all.  &#8220;The road on which we enter is a royal road which leads to  heaven,&#8221; says St. Teresa. &#8220;Is it strange that the conquest  of such a treasure should cost us rather dear?&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">169</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p141"></A>It is one of the many indirect testimonies to the  objective reality of mysticism that the stages of this road, the  psychology <a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="green">p. 92</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_92"></A> of the spiritual ascent, as  described to us by different schools of contemplatives, always present  practically the same sequence of states. The &#8220;school for  saints&#8221; has never found it necessary to bring its curriculum up  to date. The psychologist finds little difficulty, for instance, in  reconciling the &#8220;Degrees of Orison&#8221; described by St.  Teresa  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">170</FONT></A>
   &#8212;Recollection, Quiet, Union, Ecstasy, Rapt, the &#8220;Pain of  God,&#8221; and the Spiritual Marriage of the soul&#8212;with the four  forms of contemplation enumerated by Hugh of St. Victor, or the  Sufi&#8217;s &#8220;Seven Stages&#8221; of the soul&#8217;s ascent to  God, which begin in adoration and end in spiritual marriage.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">171</FONT></A>
    Though each wayfarer may choose different landmarks, it is clear from  their comparison that the road is one.</p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p144"></A>(5) As a corollary to these four rules, it is perhaps  well to reiterate the statement already made, that   <i>True Mysticism is never self-seeking.</i>    It is not, as many think, the pursuit of supernatural joys; the  satisfaction of a high ambition. The mystic does not enter on his  quest because he desires the happiness of the Beatific Vision, the  ecstasy of union with the Absolute, or any other personal reward. That  noblest of all passions, the passion for perfection for Love&#8217;s  sake, far outweighs the desire for transcendental satisfaction.  &#8220;O Love,&#8221; said St. Catherine of Genoa, &#8220;I do not  wish to follow thee for sake of these delights, but solely from the  motive of true love.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">172</FONT></A>
    Those who do otherwise are only, in the plain words of St. John of  the Cross, &#8220;spiritual gluttons&#8221;:  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">173</FONT></A>
    or, in the milder metaphor here adopted, magicians of the more  high-minded sort. The true mystic claims no promises and makes no  demands. He goes because he must, as Galahad went towards the Grail:  knowing that for those who can live it, this alone is life. He never  rests in that search for God which he holds to be the fulfilment of  his highest duty; yet he seeks without any certainty of success. He  holds with St. Bernard that &#8220;He alone is God who can never be  sought in vain: not even when He cannot be found.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">174</FONT></A>
    With Mechthild of Magdeburg, he hears the Absolute saying in his  soul, &#8220;O soul, before the world was I longed for thee: and I  still long for thee, and thou for Me. Therefore, when our two desires  unite, Love shall be fulfilled.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">175</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p149"></A>Like his type, the &#8220;devout lover&#8221; of  romance, then, the mystic serves without hope of reward. By one of the  many paradoxes of the spiritual life, he obtains satisfaction because  he does not seek it; completes his personality because he gives it up.  &#8220;Attainment,&#8221; <a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_93"></A> says Dionysius  the Areopagite in words which are writ large on the annals of  Christian ecstasy, &#8220;comes only by means of this sincere,  spontaneous, and entire surrender of yourself and all things.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">176</FONT></A>
    Only with the annihilation of selfhood comes the fulfilment of love.  Were the mystic asked the cause of his often extraordinary behaviour,  his austere and steadfast quest, it is unlikely that his reply would  contain any reference to sublime illumination or unspeakable delights.  It is more probable that he would answer in some such words as those  of Jacob Boehme, &#8220;I am not come to this meaning, or to this work  and knowledge through my own reason or through my own will and  purpose; neither have I sought this knowledge, nor so much as to know  anything concerning it. I sought only for the heart of God, therein to  hide myself.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">177</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p152"></A>&#8220;Whether we live or whether we die,&#8221; said  St. Paul, &#8220;we are the Lord&#8217;s.&#8221; The mystic is a  realist, to whom these words convey not a dogma but an invitation: an  invitation to the soul to attain that fullness of life for which she  was made, to &#8220;lose herself in That which can be neither seen nor  touched; giving herself entirely to this sovereign Object without  belonging either to herself or to others; united to the Unknown by the  most noble part of herself and because of her renouncement of  knowledge; finally drawing from this absolute ignorance a knowledge  which the understanding knows not how to attain.  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">178</FONT></A>
    Mysticism, then, is seen as the &#8220;one way out&#8221; for the  awakened spirit of man; healing that human incompleteness which is the  origin of our divine unrest. &#8220;I am sure,&#8221; says Eckhart,  &#8220;that if a soul knew the very least of all that Being means, it  would never turn away from it.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">179</FONT></A>
    The mystics have never turned away: to do so would have seemed to  them a self-destructive act. Here, in this world of illusion, they  say, we have no continuing city. This statement, to you a proposition,  is to us the central fact of life. &#8220;Therefore, it is necessary  to hasten our departure from hence, and detach ourselves in so far as  we may from the body to which we are fettered, in order that with the  whole of our selves, we may fold ourselves about Divinity, and have no  part void of contact with Him.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">180</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p156"></A>To sum up. Mysticism is seen to be a highly  specialized form of that search for reality, for heightened and  completed life, which we have found to be a constant characteristic of  human consciousness. It is largely prosecuted by that &#8220;spiritual  spark,&#8221; that transcendental faculty which, though the life of  our life, remains below the threshold in ordinary men. Emerging from  its <a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="green">p. 94</font></A> <A NAME="an_iii.iv-Page_94"></A> hiddenness in the mystic, it  gradually becomes the dominant factor in his life; subduing to its  service, and enhancing by its saving contact with reality, those vital  powers of love and will which we attribute to the heart, rather than  those of mere reason and perception, which we attribute to the head.  Under the spur of this love and will, the whole personality rises in  the acts of contemplation and ecstasy to a level of consciousness at  which it becomes aware of a new field of perception. By this  awareness, by this &#8220;loving sight,&#8221; it is stimulated to a  new life in accordance with the Reality which it has beheld. So  strange and exalted is this life, that it never fails to provoke  either the anger or the admiration of other men. &#8220;If the great  Christian mystics,&#8221; says Leuba, &#8220;could by some miracle be  all brought together in the same place, each in his habitual  environment, there to live according to his manner, the world would  soon perceive that they constitute one of the most amazing and  profound variations of which the human race has yet been  witness.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">181</FONT></A>
 </p>   
<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p158"></A>A discussion of mysticism, regarded as a form of human  life, will therefore include two branches. First the life process of  the mystic: the remaking of his personality; the method by which his  peculiar consciousness of the Absolute is attained, and faculties  which have been evolved to meet the requirements of the phenomenal,  are enabled to do work on the transcendental, plane. This is the  &#8220;Mystic Way&#8221; in which the self passes through the states  or stages of development which were codified by the Neoplatonists, and  after them by the mediaeval mystics, as Purgation, Illumination, and  Ecstasy. Secondly, the content of the mystical field of perception;  the revelation under which the contemplative becomes aware of the  Absolute. This will include a consideration of the so called doctrines  of mysticism: the attempts of the articulate mystic to sketch for us  the world into which he has looked, in language which is only adequate  to the world in which the rest of us dwell. Here the difficult  question of symbolism, and of symbolic theology, comes in: a point  upon which many promising expositions of the mystics have been  wrecked. It will be our business to strip off as far as may be the  symbolic wrapping, and attempt a synthesis of these doctrines; to  resolve the apparent contradictions of objective and subjective  revelations, of the ways of negation and affirmation, emanation and  immanence, surrender and deification, the Divine Dark and the Inward  Light; and finally to exhibits if we can, the essential unity of that  experience in which the human soul enters consciously into the  Presence of God.</p>

<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p25"></A>         In this connexion Godfernaux (    <i>Revue</i>          <i>Philosophique,</i>      February, 1902) has a highly significant remark to the effect that    romanticism represents the invasion of secular literature by mystic    or religious emotion. It is, he says, the     <i>secularization of the inner life.</i>      Compare also Bremond, &#8220;Pri&egrave;re et Poesie.&#8221;</p></P>

<p><A NAME="an_iii.iv-p30"></A>         I take from Hebert&#8217;s monograph &#8220;Le Divin&#8221; two    examples of the analogy between mystical and musical emotion. First    that of Gay, who had &#8220;the soul, the heart, and the head full    of music, of another beauty than that which is formulated by    sounds.&#8221; Next that of Ruysbroeck, who, in a passage that might    have been written by Keats, speaks of contemplation and Love as    &#8220;two heavenly pipes&#8221; which, blown upon by the Holy    Spirit, play &#8220;ditties of no tone&#8221; (    <i>op. cit</i>     . p. 29).</p></P>
