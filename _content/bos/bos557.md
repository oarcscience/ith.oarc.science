                    MAIN RITUAL, UEA 20TH ANNIVERSARY

    This ritual came together in strange ways.  We are indebted to
    Tony Kelly of Celene Community in Wales who wrote the body of it
    in a piece called "Pagan Musings" in 1973, Kenny and Tzipora for
    the Wine Blessing, and Thomas Palmer of Denver for the Cakes
    Blessing.  The Quarters calling and dismissals were written by
    Rowan Moonstone and revised by Bristlecone Glen.  Devin Storm,
    Harper to Bristlecone wrote the God and Goddess Invocations, the
    Circle Closing, and the Crone's speech.  We learned this
    particular version of "We All Come From the Goddess/Hoof and
    Horn" with the God verse from the Old Timers from United Earth
    Assembly and the Witches' Version of " Amazing Grace" was taught
    to us by Margot Adler at the America the Beautiful celebration in
    Colorado Springs in July of 1993.  All these various parts came
    together into one of the most powerful rituals we have ever seen.

    We give it back to the community now with love and thanks.  It is
    our heritage and our future.  We give back to the Earth that
    which we have been given.

    HP:  Maiden bring Your Flowers
         Mother, Bring Your Child
         Old One bring your Wisdom
         Bright Lady, Cerridwen
         We welcome Thee to this Circle in Herne's name.
         For we are the blush of Thy silken cheek.
         We are the children You hold to Your breast.
         We are the Carriers of Your ancient way.
         Bright Lady, Cerridwen, Welcome!

    HPS: Hunter, bring Your prowess
         Warrior, bring your skill.
         Father, bring your guidance.
         Ancient One, Horned Crown
         We welcome Thee to this Circle in Thy Lady's name.
         For we are the flight of the arrow from Thy bow.
         We are the edge of the sword of Thy honor.
         We are the sparks of the flame of Thy love.
         Ancient One, Horned Crowned, Welcome!

    HPS:      We're of the old religion, sired of Time, and born of
              our beloved Earth Mother.  For too long the people have

              trodden a stony path that goes only onward beneath a
              sky that goes only upwards.

    HP:       The Horned God plays in a lonely glade for the people
              are scattered in this barren age and the winds carry
              his  plaintive notes over deserted heaths and reedy
              moors and into the lonely grasses.

    (Grey Man raps staff on ground comes into center of Circle
    unobserved by the HP/S.  When he speaks, HP/S should be
    startled.)

    Grey Man: Who know now the ancient tongue of the Moon?  And who
              speaks still with the Goddess?  The magic of the land
              of Lirien and the old pagan gods have withered in the
              dragons breath; the old ways of magic have slipped into
              the well of the past, and only the rocks now remember
              what the moon told us long ago, and what we learned
              from the trees, and the voices of grasses and the
              scents of flowers.

    2453

    (HP/S begin to spiral into the center of the Circle to meet the
    Grey Man.)

    HP:       We're pagans and we worship the pagan gods, and among
              the  people there are witches yet who speak with the
              moon and  dance with the Horned One.

    HPS:      But a witch is a rare pagan in these days, deep and
              inscrutable, recognizable only by their own kind, by
              the light in their eyes and the love in their breasts,
              by the magic in their hands and the lilt of their
              tongue and by their knowledge of the real.

    HP:       But the wiccan way is one way.  There are many; there
              are pagans the world over who worship the Earth Mother
              and the Sky Father, the Rain God and the Rainbow
              Goddess, the Dark One and the Hag on the mountain, the
              Moon Goddess and the little People in the mists on the
              other side of the veil.


    HPS:      A pagan is one who worships the goddesses and gods of
              nature, whether by observation or by study, whether by
              love or admiration, or whether in their sacred rites
              with the Moon, or the great festivals of the Sun.

    Grey Man: Many suns ago, as the pale dawn of reason crept across
              the pagan sky, man grew out of believing in THE GODS.


    Harper:   He has yet to grow out of disbelieving in them.

    Grey Man: He who splits the Goddess on an existence-nonexistence
              dichotomy will earn himself only paradoxes, for the
              gods are not so divided and nor the magic lands of the
              Brother of Time.

    Harper:   Does a mind exist?

    Grey Man: Ask her and she will tell you yes, but seek her out,
              and she'll elude you.  She is in every place, and in no

              place, and you'll see her works in all places, but
              herself in none.  Existence was the second-born from
              the Mother's womb and contains neither the first-born,
              nor the unborn. Show us your mind, and we'll show you
              the gods!

    Harper:   No matter that you can't, for we can't show you the
              gods.   But come with us and the Goddess herself will
              be our love and the God will call the tune.

    Grey Man: But a brass penny for your reason; for logic is a
              closed ring, and the child doesn't validate the Mother,
              nor the dream the dreamer.  (Grey Man turns to face the
              seated  Crone.  Speaks almost as if talking to himself)
              And what matter the wars of opposites to she who has
              fallen in love with a whirlwind or to the lover of the
    2454

              arching rainbow.

    Harper:   (To HP/S) But tell us of your Goddess as you love her,
              and the gods that guide your works, and we'll listen
              with  wonder, for to do less would be arrogant.  but
              we'll do  more, for the heart of man is aching for
              memories only  half forgotten, and the Old Ones only
              half unseen.

    HP:       We'll write the old myths as they were always written
              and  we'll read them on the rocks and in the caves and
              in the deep of the greenwood's shade, and we'll hear
              them in the rippling mountain streams and in the
              rustling of the leaves, and we'll see them in the storm
              clouds, and in the evening mists.  We've no wish to
              create a new religion for our religion is as old as the
              hills and older, and we've no wish to bring differences
              together.

    Harper:   Differences are like different flowers in a meadow, and

              we are all one in the Mother.

    HPS:      What need is there for a pagan movement since our
              religion has no teachings and we hear it in the wind
              and feel it in the stones and the Moon will dance with
              us as she will?

    Harper:   There is a need.  For long the Divider has been among
              our people and the tribes of man are no more.  The sons
              of the Sky Father have all but conquered nature, but
              they have poisoned her breast and the Mother is sad for
              the butterflies are dying and the night draws on.

    Grey Man: A curse on the conqueror!

    HP/S:     But not of us!

    Harper:   For they curse themselves for they are nature too.

    Grey Man: They have stolen our magic and sold it to the
              mindbenders and the mindbenders tramp a maze that has
              no outlet for they fear the real for the One who guards
              the path.  Where are the pagan shrines?  And where do
              the people gather?  Where is the magic made?  And where
              are the Goddess and the Old Ones?

    HP:       Our shrines are in the fields and on the mountains, in
              the stars and in the wind, deep in the greenwood and on

              the algal rocks where two streams meet.  But the
              shrines are deserted, and if we gathered in the arms of
              the Moon for our ancient rites to be with our gods as
              we were of old, we would be stopped by the dead who now
              rule the Mother's land and claim rights of ownership on
              the Mother's breast, and make laws of division and
              frustration for us.

    2455

    HPS:      We can no longer gather with our gods in a public place

              and the old rites of communion have been driven from
              the towns and cities ever deeper into the heath where
              barely a handful of heathens have remained to guard the
              old secrets and enact the old rites.  There is magic in
              the heath far from the cold grey society, and there are

              islands of magic hidden in the entrails of the
              metropolis behind closed doors, but the people are few,
              and the barriers between us are formidable.

    HP:       The old religion has become a dark way, obscure, and
              hidden in the protective bosom of the night.  Thin
              fingers turn the pages of a book of shadows while the
              sunshine seeks in vain his worshippers in his leafy
              glades.


    Harper:   Here, then, is the basic reason for a Pagan Movement;
              we must create a pagan society wherein everyone shall
              be free to worship the goddesses and gods of nature,
              and the relationship between a worshipper and their
              gods shall be sacred and inviolable, provided only that
              in their love of their own gods, they doesn't curse the
              names of the gods of others.

    HPS:      It's not yet our business to press the law-makers with
              undivided endeavor to unmake the laws of repression
              and,  with the Mother's love, it may never become our
              business for the stifling tides of dogmatism are at
              last already in ebb.  Our first work, and our greatest
              wish, is to come together, to be with each other in our
              tribes for we haven't yet grown from the Mother's
              breast to the stature of the gods.

    HP:       We're of the earth, and sibs to all the children of
              wild nature, born long ago in the warm mud of the ocean
              floor;  we were together then, and we were together in
              the rain forests long before that dark day when,
              beguiled by the pride of the Sky Father, and forgetful
              of the Mother's love, we killed her earlier-born
              children and impoverished the old genetic pool.

    Grey Man: The Red child lives yet in America; the Black Child has

              not forsaken the gods; the old Australians are still
              with their nature gods; the Old Ones still live deep in
              the heart of Mother India, and the White Child has
              still a foot on the old wiccan way, but Neanderthaler
              is no more and her magic faded as the Lli and the
              Archan burst their banks and the ocean flowed in to
              divide the Isle of Erin from the land of the White
              Goddess.  Man looked with one eye on a two-faced god
              when he reached for the heavens and scorned the Earth
              which alone is our life and our provider and the bosom
              to which we have ever returned since the dawn of Time.

    2456

    Harper:   He who looks only to reason to plum the unfathomable is
              a fool, for logic is an echo already implicit in the
              question, and it has no voice of its own;  but he is no
              greater fool than he who scorns logic or derides its
              impotence from afar, but fears to engage in fair combat
              when he stands on his opponent's threshold. Don't turn
              your back on Reason, for his thrust is deadly; but
              confound him and he'll yield for his code of combat is
              honorable. So here is more of the work of the Pagan
              Movement.

    HPS:      Our lore has become encrusted over the ages with occult

              trivia and the empty vapourings of the lost.  The
              occult arts are in a state of extreme decadence,
              astrology is in a state of disrepute and fears to
              confront the statistician's sword; alien creeds oust
              our native arts and, being as little understood as our
              own forgotten arts, are just as futile for their lack
              of understanding, and more so for their unfamiliarity.

    HP:       Misunderstanding is rife. Disbelief is black on every
              horizon, and vampires abound on the blood of the
              credulous.  Our work is to reject the trivial, the
              irrelevant and the erroneous, and to bring the lost
              children of the Earth Mother again into the court of
              the Sky Father where reason alone will avail.

    Harper:   Belief is the deceit of the credulous; it has no place
              in the heart of a pagan.

    Grey Man: But while we are sad for those who are bemused by
              Reason,  we are deadened by those who see no further
              than his syllogisms as he turns the eternal wheel of
              the Great Tautology.

    HP:       We were not fashioned in the mathematician's
              computations, and we were old when the first alchemist
              was a child.

    HPS:      We have walked in the magic forest, bewitched in the
              old Green Things; we have seen the cauldron and the one

              become many and the many in the one; we know the Silver

              Maid of the moonlight and the sounds of the cloven
              feet.   We have heard the pipes on the twilight ferns,
              and we've seen the spells of the enchantress, and Time
              be stilled.   We've been into eternal darkness where
              the Night Mare rides and rode her to the edge of the
              Abyss, and beyond, and we know the dark face of the
              Rising Sun.

    Harper:   Spin a spell or words and make a magic knot; spin it on

              the magic loom and spin it with the gods.  Say it in
              the old chant and say it to the Goddess, and in her
              name.   Say it to a dark well and breathe it on a
    2457

              stone.

    HP:       There are no signposts on the untrod way,

    HPS:      but we'll make our rituals together and bring them as
              our gifts to the Goddess and her God in the great
              rites.

    (HP/S turn to Circle)

    HP:       Here, then, is our work in the Pagan Movement; to make
              magic in the name of our gods, to share our magic where
              the gods would wish it, and to come together in our
              ancient festivals of birth, and life, of death and of
              change in the old rhythm.

    HPS:      We'll print the rituals that can be shared in the
              written work;

    HP:       We'll do all in our power to bring the people together,

              to teach those who would learn, and to learn from those

              who can teach.

    HPS:      We will initiate groups, bring people to groups, and
              groups to other groups in our common devotion to the
              goddesses and gods of nature.

    HP:       We will not storm the secrets of any coven, nor profane

              the tools, the magic, and still less, the gods of
              another.

    HPS:      We'll collect the myths of the ages, of our people and
              of the pagans of other lands, and we'll study the books
              of the wise and we'll talk to the very young.

    HP:       And whatever the pagan needs in their study, or their
              worship, then it is our concern, and the Movement's
              business to do everything possible to help each other
              in  our worship of the gods we love.

    HPS:      We are committed with the lone pagan on the seashore,
              with he who worships in the fastness of a mountain
              range or she who sings the old chant in a lost valley
              far from the metalloid road.

    HP:       We are committed with the wanderer, and equally with
              the prisoner, disinherited from the Mother's milk in
              the darkness of the industrial webs.

    HPS:      We are committed too with the coven, with the circular
              dance in the light of the full moon, with the great
              festivals of the sun, and with the gatherings of the
              people.

    HP:       We are committed to build our temples in the towns and
    2458

              in the wilderness, to buy the lands and the streams
              from the landowners and give them to the Goddess for
              her children's use, and we'll replant the greenwood as
              it was of old for love of the dryad stillness, and for
              love of our children's children.

    HP/S:     This we will do.  What will you?  (At this point, HP/S
              should walk around the Circle and "gather" the pledges
              from those in Circle who wish to give them.
              Participants should think carefully about what they
              wish to pledge before the Gods in this ritual.  When
              all  pledges are gathered, HP/S takes them to the Grey
              Man)

    HPS:      When the streams flow clear and the winds blow pure,
              and the sun never more rises unrenowned nor the moon
              ride in the skies unloved;

    HP:       when the stones tell of the Horned God and the
              greenwood grows deep to call back her own ones, then
              our work will be ended

    HP/S:     and the Pagan Movement will return to the beloved womb
              of our old religion, to the nature goddesses and gods
              of paganism.   (Grey Man nods, receives the pledges and
              palms flash powder unobtrusively.  Conducts HP/S to the
              Crone.  Grey Man opens hands and lets paper fall on
              candle.  Crone pours hot water on dry ice, stands up,
              throws back hood of cape)

    Crone:    I have heard your call across the mountains.  I have
              heard your cries within the web of life and I have come

              once more.  Single is the race, single of men and Gods.

              From a single source we both draw breath, but a
              difference of power in everything keeps us apart.  You
              are the children of my heart - the  light of my Soul.
              And I bring with me the seeds of your  ancestors that I
              have kept safe for you.  Like the cycle  of the
              seasons, I give them again that you may plant yet
              again.  Sow the seeds for yourselves , for your
              children, and your children's children.

    (Crone hands basket of seeds to HP/S.  Reaches into the well
    again and draws out chalice from cauldron.)

              The chalice contains the blood of those who have died
              for the crime of being different, the sweat of those
              who toiled that the path of the Old Ones might survive,
              and the tears of those who thought themselves alone.
              The cauldron of the Gods is that of change - of turning

              evil to good, death to life.  Through the power of the
              Cauldron, turn the blood of death to the water of life,
              turn the crime of being different to the strength of
              being whole.  Turn the sweat of toil to the joy of work
              well done.  Turn the tears of those alone to the tears
    2459

              of family reunited.  The present is the balance between
              the past and the future.  The power lies within your
              heart, within your hands.  Do you have the courage?
              The choice is his, the choice is hers, the  choice is
              yours.  Can you make a difference?  WILL you make a
              difference?

    (Crone hands chalice to HP/S and wraps cloak around her,  sitting
    down once more.)

    HP/S spiral back out to the Circle.

    Chalice blessing:

    HP:       Be it known that a man is not greater than a woman
    HPS:      Nor is woman greater than man
    HP:       For what one lacks
    HPS:      The other can provide
    HP:       As the athame is to the male
    HPS:      So is the cup to the female
    HP/S:     And when conjoined, they become one in truth.  For
              there is no greater magick in all the world than that
              of love.

    Cakes Blessing:

    HPS:      Be it known that death is not the end of life ...
    HP:       But the beginning of the cycle of rebirth.
    HPS:      As grain is touched by death's scythe ...
    HP:       And passes through fire to be reborn as bread ...
    HPS:      So are we reborn, passing through death into the next
              life.

    (High Priest draws Invoking Pentagram over cakes with Athame,
    while both say:

    HP/S:     As the Earth gives its life to strengthen us, so shall
              we, in death, strengthen the Earth, for life and death
              together are the cycle of rebirth.

    HP/S take of cakes and wine and pass the basket and chalice to
    quarters callers to take to the Circle.

    We all come from the Goddess
    And to Her we shall return
    Like a drop or rain
    Flowing to the ocean

    We all come from the Horned One
    And to Him we shall return
    Like a flash of flame
    Ascending to the heavens.

    Hoof and Horn
    Hoof and Horn
    All that dies shall be reborn
    Vine and Grain
    Vine and Grain
    2460

    All that falls shall rise again.

    (The chant may evolve into others such as the Isis Astarte and
    corresponding God chants.  Go with the flow.   When all in the
    Circle have partaken of cakes and wine, the chalice comes back to
    the HP and HPS, who take it to the Harper.  Harper eats and
    drinks, takes cakes and wine to Grey Man.  Grey Man eats and
    drinks, takes cakes and wine to Crone, who eats, drinks, and
    receives seeds and chalice again.  Replaces chalice in Cauldron,
    covers seeds with cloak.  When HPS feels energy has built to a
    peak, she calls a halt to it by raising her arms and dropping
    them to her sides.)

    HP/S:     Remember this night.  Take the energy that has been
              raised here by your sisters and brothers and put it
              into your pledges.  YOU ARE NOT ALONE!

    HPS:      Hunter, for Your prowess
              Warrior, for Your skill
              Father for Your Guidance
              Ancient One, Horned Crowned,
              We thank you and bid you Hail and Farewell!

    HP:       Maiden, for Your flowers.
              Mother, for Your child.
              Old One, for Your Wisdom.
              Bright Lady, Cerridwen, we thank You
              And bid you Hail and Farewell!

    Spirits of the North!
    Earth, Body of our ancestors.
    Go with us from this place
    United as heirs of our ancestors.

    Spirits of the West!
    Water, Blood of our ancestors.
    We have the courage to dare to do the work.
    Go with us from this place
    United as heirs of our ancestors.

    Spirits of the South,
    Fire, will of our ancestors.
    We have the will to do that which we promised
    Go with us from this place
    United as heirs of our ancestors.

    Spirits of the East
    Air, breath of our ancestors.
    We KNOW that we are the children of the Gods and all one family.
    Go with us from this place
    United as heirs of our ancestors.

    HP draws power back up into the blade of the sword/athame and
    earths the power.  HP, HPS, Harper, Grey Man and Crone move into
    a circle.  The next five lines should be shot from person to
    person, to form a pentagram:

    HPS:      The Circle is Open

    HP:       But not forgotten!
    Harper:   The Circle is unbroken.
    Grey Man: Nothing is forgotten
    Crone:    The Circle is Free
    All:      Nothing is ever forgotten

    HPS, HP, Harper, Grey Man, and Crone join the larger Circle.  HPS
    or Harper calls out lines of Amazing Grace to the Circle as all
    sing.

    Amazing Grace! How sweet the Earth
    That formed a Witch like me
    I once was burned, now I survive
    Was hanged, but now I sing.

    Twas grace that drew down the moon
    And grace that raised the sea
    The magick of the people's will
    Will set our Mother free!

    Amazing Grace! How sweet the Earth
    That formed a Witch like me
    I once was burned, but now I thrive
    Was hanged but now I sing.

    HPS:      Blessed Be!
