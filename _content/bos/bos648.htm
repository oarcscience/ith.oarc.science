SYNTHESIS OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION

[...]
... we will define this writing as simply an interesting look
into quantum-statistical methods of simulating energy-informational
processes.

... Boris Iskakov who was born in Magnitogorsk on November 14, 1934.
He is a graduate of the Institute of Physical Engineering in Moscow.

... In this work he endeavors to synthesize elements of science
and religion.  Dr. Iskakov has recently been interrogated and we
would share the interview with you.

... The interview comes from Russian documents so we will meander
through the translations as best we can and at least you will be

[QUOTING]

MATHEMATICAL TRANSFORMATIONS

The equations of Schrodinger and Dirac, well known in quantum
physics, describe the laws of the conservation of probability for
fluxes of matter at the level of elementary particles of the
microworld. By means of certain mathematical transformations I
(Dr. Iskakov) obtained equivalent equations of a much broader
applicability. They describe the laws of the conservation of
probability for fluxes of matter, energy, and information. The
equations have a deep philasophical meaning, which extends far
beyond the interpretation of the Schrodinger and Dirac equations. An
appropriate name for them is, in my view, suggested by a doctrine
of Oriental philosophy--karma. In a narrow sense, it claims that
every deed or thought, good or bad, receives due reward or
retribution. In a broader sense, it denotes the principle of unity,
integrity, and inter-conditionality and causality in the Universe.
That is how I construe the term &quot;equations of karma&quot;, which
describe any cause-and-effect relationship.

WHAT IS THE &quot;EQUATION OF KARMA&quot;?

The study of psychic phenomena dictated the need to define the
concept of the information-energy field. Its material medium,
according to contemporary notions, may be a global lepton gas,
consisting of extremely light particles, microleptons, with a mass
of 10^-40 - 10^-30 g. Microleptons are much lighter than electrons
and are capable af freely penetrating any body in the Universe. The
gaps between atomic nuclei are for them just as spacious as are the
holes in a fishing net for molecules of air.

3114

The idea of a microlepton gas appears to echo the 19th-century
notion of the universal ether, but is scientifically much more
complex and profound. What we are talking about in this case is no
longer an ideal space-pervading fluid, but a quantum-granular
structure of the space-time continuum, filled with whirling streams
of polarized microleptons (including some virtually vacuum-born).

Such an approach enables us to use the mathematical apparatus of
quantum mechanics to describe the information-energy field.
Moreover, relationships of a higher level of generalization are
derived than the classical equations of Schrodinger. The new
equations describe not only the movements of matter, but also the
development of the totality of interconnections, signals, events,
and processes. The special term introduced for such relationships
is &quot;equations of karma&quot;. As for karma, it is understood to mean a
broad philosophical category of universal inter-conditionality,
causality, and dependence in combination with the principle of the
unity and integrity of the Universe. There are two equations of
karma--the direct and the complex-conjugated:

GS&gt; (NOTE:  I have substituted regular letters for the Dr.'s
GS&gt; symbols)

       AY=0; A'Y'=0;

      where the operators have the form

       A=2h^2V + i2h o/o t-9;
       A'=2h^2V - i2h o/o t-9.

Here Y denotes the probability density wave (the wave function);
V, the Laplace operator; 9, the potential energy density, and h,
Planck's constant.

These equations may be solved in the form of karma waves and
anti-waves with quantization of probability waves. Connected with
them are perturbations of the information-energy field, i.e., wave
signals. In principle, such signals may propagate faster than light.

The equations of karma make it possible to draw certain
philosophical conclusions of fundamental significance. It follows
from them that diffraction takes place not only in space but also in
time. Any event is, so to speak, split in space-time. The
propagation of a solitary signal is preceded by a series of pre-
signals and followed by post-signals, both fading with distance.
Perceptive analysts are able to use the first intimations of
pre-signals to give a precise picture of a coming event. This is
called scientific foresight. But there is also intuitive prevision.
Centuries ago clairvoyants described events that are happening in
our time.

Pre-signals provide an explanation of relative proscopy--when a
sensitive person learns about an event before others do. Such a
person detects faint pre-signals that most people do not perceive.

For instance, an explosion on the Sun may produce solar prominences
extending for millions of kilometers. Two or three days later the
&quot;solar wind&quot; reaches the Earth, causing powerful geomagnetic
3115

storms that affect everything living. During such periods, disease
and mortality rates increase in all countries.

This dependence of everything living upon solar catastrophes was
proved several decades ago by Alexander Chizhevsky. Can we learn of
the approaching &quot;solar winds&quot; in advance? It appears that we can.
The solar wind has presignals: swift streams of solar photons an
neutrinos, which reach the Earth in eight minutes. By detecting them
it is possible to warn the medical services of all countries of an
imminent geomagnetic storm two or three days in advance, ample
time to take the necessary measures.

From the theoretical standpoint the works of the eminent Russian
researcher Anatoly Okhatrin are of definite interest. They confirm
the idea of an ether or universal lepton gas, which contains full
information about the material world. Clusters of the lightest par-
ticles--microleptons--carry people's thoughts and feelings; these
microleptons are capable of travelling in space and time at
tremendous speeds.

The speed of light is a limiting factor only for a continuous stream
of speeds, the so-called continuum. However, greater speed levels,
in excess of the speed of light, are possible for extremely weak
signals.

Okhatrin's experiments and calculations show that people's thoughts
are carried by the lightest microleptons. And the equations of karma
prove that they can travel much faster than light. This justifies
the conclusion that humanity's potential in getting to understarnd
the Universe is practically boundless.

Up to now it was considered that our potential in the conquest of
outer space is limited by what is known as the pessimistic radius
of Poincare-Einstein. If we multiply the speed of light by the
human life span, we arrive at the limit that even the most sophis-
ticated spaceships cannot surpass. No generation of spacemen can
explore the Universe beyond that radius [it says].

But from the equations of karma it follows that at the level of
extremely weak signals we can reach out far beyond the Poincare-
Einstein sphere. Material thought can travel to distant regions of
the Universe at a speed greater than that of light. Man can obtain
information about what is happening at any distance from him. This
is a fundamental philosophical conclusion that allows humanity to
look to the future with optimism.

I arrived at this conclusion by considering the equations of karma.
But then, many scientists before me have reflected on the
synthesis of science and religion, among them the founders of
quantum physics. What are termed the conjugated equations of
Schrodinger and Dirac point to the possibility of the existence of
anti-particles. Similarly, the conjugated equation of karma suggests
that there can be anti-signals as well as anti-particles. More-
over, this equation makes it possible to describe the spectrum of
properties that these anti-signals possess. While ordinary signals
travel along the river of time from the past via the present into
the future, anti-signals travel in the opposite direction. They
originate in the future and pass through the present into the past.
3116

This property of anti-signals stuns our imagination: certain
particularly sensitive people and instruments can, it turns out,
receive signals from the future.

Previsions, predictions, and prophesies come under the scientific
heading of absolute proscopy, which implies the acquisition of
information about events that have not yet taken place. They have
yet to occur, but sensitives already know about them.

The problem is merely one of the threshold of sensitivity and the
balance of signals and noise. Anti-signals come from the future at
a faint and very faint level. Very few people can detect them.

There is no violation here of the principle of causality. Rather,
its interpretation becomes more sophisticated and more refined
dialectically. According to the equations of karma, time in the
microworld can reverse its direction, turning, as it were, into
&quot;anti time&quot;. From a single point it is possible to see both the past
and the future of microparticles at the same time.

We can receive information about the future only at the
probability level. Only the strategic parameters of a human fate are
pre-determined. But freedom of choice too is preserved: a person is
free to take any decisions and bears full responsibility for them.
A person shapes his or her destiny and pays for the consequences of
those decisions. Thus, there is a predetermined part of the future,
which a person cannot change, and there is a probable or variable
part, for which he is responsible.

Solving stationary equations can yield curious results. Waves
emitted and absorbed by hundreds of biologically active points are
superimposed on one another and form a series of standing waves,
which surround the human body. The body turns out to be nothing more
than a dense nucleus shrouded on all sides by a number of
energy-information holograms. The shape of the first hologram
follows that of the human body, but is enlarged and rounded,
remotely resembling a spacesuit. Actually, this hologram contains
all the information about the body and is carried by microleptons
orbiting along the quantum shell, the boundary of the first
hologram. The second hologram and its shell are larger and carry
weakened information, which is more difficult to decipher. The
same may be said of the third and subsequent shells. The more remote
shells are more rounded in shape, changing from a spacesuit to an
egg and then to a sphere. Our atomic-molecular body is &quot;clad&quot; in
microlepton holograms, each of which carries complete but weakened
information about the person, including his or her innermost
thoughts and feelings, his or her mind and conscience. It may be
said that the sum-total of these holograms is nothing short of a
person's lepton soul.

Ordinarily, people do not see the energy-information shells that
surround them. But in certain conditions it is possible to make the
first hologram glow, especially the part of it surrounding a
person's head. The fact is that upper chakras, the most
power-intensive, operate at the highest frequencies. Some people
have a first quantum shell that can become visible.

Estimates show that the energy of the first shell amounts to
3117

fractions of an electron-volt. This is quite enough for a faint glow
in the optical range of the spectrum. But for the glow to become a
reality a great deal of energy has to be pumped into the upper
chakras. This means a person has to adopt a definite mode of life:
overcome base passions, and make his or her thoughts, feelings,
and deeds pure, lofty and inspired. It is in that case that the
energy of the upper chakras causes the excitation of the first shell
by fractions of an electron-volt, and a halo visible to other people
appears around the head of such a person (for example, a saint).

In Christian art, only part of the hologram around the head is
usually portrayed as glowing. But in Buddhist temples, there are
pictures showing the whole spacesuit-shaped hologram aglow.

The most ancient Buddhist manuscripts speak of a person's seven
bodies: one dense and six subtle. The first hologram is called the
ethereal body; the second, the astral body; the third, the mental
body, and so forth. The lepton hypothesis allows a larger number of
holograms.

Judging from the equations of karma, we humans are infinitely
&quot;larger&quot; and our lives are infinitely longer than we are accustomed
to think. This means that each person is a factor of Cosmic
significance.

Moreover, analysis reveals that inanimate objects as well as Homo
Sapiens and other living beings have holograms of this kind.

Consider the implications of this. If each body is present, at the
information level, throughout the Cosmos, then in every small region
of space-time there must be, if only super-weak, information about
the entire Universe.

Gautama Buddha's famous dictum states &quot;everything is in
everything&quot; and, hence, &quot;everything is in the small.&quot; In an expanded
form this may be taken to mean that every point of space-time
&quot;knows&quot; everything about all the other points.

But if every zone of space &quot;knows&quot; everything, it is a most
complete encyclopaedia, in infinite storage of knowledge about the
Universe . All that is needed is to learn how to plug into this
source of information, which can tell a person about anything and
everything in the world.

It follows from the lepton hypothesis that the soul is real and
material. A human being, in the customary sense of the term, is
nothing but a dense nucleus around which streams of leptons
circulate. The totality of lepton shells is a cold bioplasma,
which contains complete information about the nucleus. Thus, it
can be termed a person's lepton soul. This notion has a quite
precise materialistic content.

According to the lepton concept, thoughts and feelings are material.
They are carried by superweak pulses of electromagnetic and
microlepton fields. Visual, audible, and other images, and all
thoughts and feelings, exist in the form of clusters of superlight
elementary particles. This brings to mind Plato's inspired guess
that all eidoses, i.e., ideas or thoughts, exist autonomously,
3118

&quot;float in the air&quot; and recognize no boundaries.

Plato intuitively arrived at that conclusion over two thousand years
ago. Today we can put this into the language of mathematical
formulae. We can measure the mass of a single human thought. Its
weight varies from 10^-30 to 10^-40 g. To be sure, the opinion of
sensitives and Okhatrin's experiments cannot serve as proof. Similar
investigations have to be carried out at other laboratories. This
will furnish the statistical data for reliable conclusions. If they
confirm Okhatrin's findings, he will become the author of the
greatest discovery of the latter half of the 20th century.

Thoughts and feelings generated by human beings begin their
independent existence in space and time. Both theory and experi-
ments show that these eidoses are capable of exchanging information.
What is most important of all is that one person's thoughts can
occur to other people. Eidoses are like small living beings, but at
the lepton level of matter. Thoughts and feelings are our offspring,
who communicate with one another and with us in a language of
super-weak signals.

Estimates show that during a lifetime a person generates millions
and even billions of eidoses. This makes it clear that we bear an
enormous responsibility before the whole of humankind and before
ourselves for what our offspring, i.e., our thoughts and feelings,
will be like.

When our offspring are noble eidoses of kindness, love, mercy,
mutual assistance, truth, beauty, and harmony, we contribute to the
health of humanity's leptonosphere. But when we beget malformed
eidoses, i.e., evil, envious, cowardly, vain, and arrogant thoughts
and feelings, we thereby pollute the leptonosphere we inhabit.
Should the negative eidoses exceed a certain critical mass,
humankind will be doomed. At present our survival depends to a great
extent on the ecology of the spirit.

Here we also come up against a legal problem. Mere criminal intent
is not yet a crime at the atomic-molecular level, but when a person
conceives, say, a murder, he or she spawns criminal eidoses, which
contaminate humankind's leptonosphere.

That is why when someone steers a nation or country onto a road
leading to disaster, that person commits the gravest offence above
all against the whole of humanity. Although economic and
political catastrophe is still many years off, it has already
taken place at the lepton level, in the public mind. The collapse of
a vast State can contaminate humanity's leptonosphere to such a
degree that humanity's very existence becomes threatened. And no
clan, no state, nor coalition that conceived such a crime against
other nations can survive.

The lepton hypothesis can provide a scientific explanation of the
essence of God. When congregations gather in their temples, they
create eidoses of prayer, which assemble into a collective
egregor-eidos of a deity. When millions of people worship it, the
material deity eidos acquires tremendous energy at the lepton level
of matter. There arises feedback: a believer not only supplies the
deity with energy, but receives genuine assistance from it upon
3119

supplication. There exist eidoses of Christ, Buddha, and Allah, and
they actually interact with their Worshippers when the latter tune
into the proper frequencies. This is something like a deposit in a
savings bank--it helps the client at at a time of need. The
microlepton &quot;savings bank&quot; is not responsible for other banks'
clients: there is no resonance correspondence between them. Alien
gods hold no power over a flock--only their own God has such powers.

Gods, thus, actually exist at the lepton level of matter. In fact,
the world religions describe different aspects of one and the same
Supreme Rational Being. All the people of the Earth worship a single
God, but in His multiple manifestations.

After the death of a person's atomic-molecular nucleus, his or her
lepton holograms may take different courses. Some of them may
likewise disintegrate. But this happens only to the holograms that
are made up of the heavier microleptons. Estimates show that the
relatively heavy holograms have a natural half-life of seven to nine
days; their ninety-nine percent decay takes about forty days.

Thus, the meaning of the funeral repast on the 9th and the 40th day
(in accordarnce with the Orthodox faith) is that the living emit
eidoses that recharge the dead person's soul with energy and
information to help it undergo the necessary changes in the lepton
world. Thanks to these rites, relatively heavy lepton holograms can
survive much longer. A reliable supply of living people's thoughts
and feelings can extend the life span of the heavy fractions of a
dead person's soul from forty days to several millennia. As long as
a person is remembered and his or her days of birth and death are
observed, that person's soul is preserved almost intact, just as it
was when the person was alive. One can communicate with it by means
of special techniques known to mystics.

The soul also has medium and light fractions. We cannot yet
verify this experimentally, but there is reason to think that
their half-lives and total decay periods are much longer than those
of the heavy fractions. It is even quite possible that the lightest
fractions live eternally--the soul is immortal according to all the
world religions. So far science cannot confirm or deny this in
strict terms. This problem remains unsolved and requires an
experimental solution.

[END OF QUOTING]


(Hatonn's comments)

The next most logical question might well be , &quot;Isn't there any way
to measure this lepton energy or aura?&quot; Yes indeed and again the
only ALLOWED presentation comes silently from Russia. There are two
scientists--the engineer and inventor Uri Kravchenko and the
physician Nikolai Kalashchenko--who have developed an original
instrument: the phase aurometer. This is a highly sensitive instru-
ment for the remote measurement of the electromagnetic radiation
of any object, biological included. The instrument and the method
are protected by a Certificate of Authorship issued in 1990. This
is an easy-to-prove concept and because of this implication I will
not introduce much about it other than generalities about which
3120

much has been shared. This is something which Dr. Young has already
devised though he doesn't recognize it as this and I would think
would remind our own &quot;tinkerers&quot; that this is nothing more than a
measuring device or a production device for electro-magnetic
fields MEASURED IN HERTZ.

The particular phase aurometer in point is only for measurement or
recordimhg a &quot;patient's&quot; own radiation by a contact-free method and
has no impact whatever on the environment. BUT, LISTEN UP: THE
APPLICATIONS OF THE PHASE AUROMETER CAN BE CONSIDERABLY EXPANDED
FURTHER INTO, FOR EXAMPLE, DOWSING, TESTING FOLK HEALERS AND
SENSITIVES AND SUCH SEEMINGLY DISTANT FIELDS AS AGRICULTURAL
SELECTION OR CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE SUPERVISION.

I am not going to publish this information in general format as
above. However, I do ask that several of the attached &quot;tinkerers&quot; be
supplied with the documentation. We need to introduce frequency
upgrading into seed for crops, etc. This is easily done but someone
has to do it and I cannot spend time educating those at random
distance. So, please make sure that Dr. Young, Dr. Hoffman, Dr.
James and Dr. Trelle are made privy to the document in point. Thank
you. It will seem quite primitive to you ones--but sometimes
simplicity is where we must RE-begin in order to conceptually change
directions. I salute you for your patience.
