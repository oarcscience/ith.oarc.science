               AUDIENCE WITH THE KEEPER OF WISDOM

      I sat on the cobblestone bridge, listening to the ancient song of
the rushing waters in the brook below and contemplating the day's
events.  I had awakened this morning with the strange anticipation and
wariness that generally accompanies the prediction of important
occurrences in one's life.  All day, I had gone about my usual routine,
waiting and watching for something out of the ordinary - but to no
avail.  There had been nothing of signifance...just another normal day
filled with the dull mundanity of household chores, grocery shopping and
bill paying.  Nothing more.

      I let out a heavy sigh, and turned my attention to the sheep
grazing in the lush meadow.  I pondered their lives and wondered if they
2417

ever felt the same anticipation I had experienced this morning.  I
smiled at the foolishness of my thoughts, knowing full well that the
creatures of the field were content enough in the simpleness which life
had to offer - ample food and water was all they required.  No, the
peaceful flock below couldn't be bothered with such nonsense.  Maybe I
should follow their lead and just turn my thoughts to the more mundane
side of life.

      Looking down at my feet as they dangled over the rushing water, I
became aware of the myriad of color that was reflected from the setting
sun.  Mesmerized by the beauty of the kaleidoscopic dance, I watched
intently as the oranges, reds and purples whirled and twirled with each
other on the surface of the brook.  The rich shades of the sunset
gradually faded into pastels and then, the irridescence of shimmering
silver.   An owl hooted nearby, jolting me fully back into reality. 
Good Goddess! Night had fallen!  How long had I been there, lost in the
absurdity of human thought?  Obviously much too long, from the looks of
things.

      I hurriedly scrambled to my feet, shivering as I gathered my shawl
about my shoulders.  The night had turned cool and damp, and the misty
veil of fog was rolling into the valley at a rapid pace.  The delicate
breeze of early day had been replaced a heavy west wind, and my hair was
whipping about my face and shoulders.  Great!  There was going to be a
storm, and here I was - in the middle of nowhere - likely to be caught
in it!

      As I neared the end of the bridge, I realized that it was too
late.  The fog had settled into a mist so dense and heavy, that I
couldn't see my hand in front of my face.  There was no use in searching
for cover, as the visibility factor was nil.  Aside from that, it was
quite dangerous to wander blindly through the valley mists - even folks
who knew the valley territory very well knew better than to try it. 
Several years earlier, one of the area residents had been caught in the
steamy vapors while in search of a missing lamb, and had been found
hours later - miles from the valley - still wandering about looking for
his home.  I cursed under my breath as I settled back onto the bridge to
wait out the fog.

      No sooner than I'd gotten situated, the fog began to dissipate
nearly as quickly as it had descended.  The wind was still blowing in
fierce gusts, but at least now, I reasoned, I should be able to find my
way home.  Without another thought, I hurried across the bridge and onto
the path below.  From the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of the
silvery moonlight reflected on the water. Suddenly, I realized that
something was wrong - genuinely wrong!  The brook had ceased to run!
Disbelieving, I rubbed my eyes and looked again.  No, I wasn't seeing
things!  Despite the heavy winds and the decline of its course, the
surface of the brook hadn't so much as a ripple.  Goddess!  The surface
was as smooth as glass!  Shock!  That was it - I must be in shock!  I
began to conjure all sorts of excuses as to why my eyes were playing
tricks on me.

      But then...it happened!  The winds began to blow from all four
directions at once, their forces concentrated at the center of the still
and lifeless brook.  A bit of mist was caught up in the forces of the
gale - twirling this way and that, becoming larger in size and stronger
in density - until all at once, the winds were hushed in deathly 
2418

silence.  There She stood - a beautiful and terrible visage - atop the
glassy water.  Robed and Hooded.  Dark and black.  Faceless.  It was
She!  The Devourer of Souls.  The Keeper of Wisdom.  She Who stirred the
Cauldron of Rebirth.  The Shapeshifter.  I shivered in fear and
anticipation.

      From beneath the hood, She gazed upon me with the invisible eyes 
that saw all.  Silently, She fixed Her eyes on mine and bade me not to
turn away.  Deeper and deeper into Her eyes I went.  Deeper.  Deeper
still.  A myriad of jewel-tone colors began to swirl in my very being -
faster, darker, brighter - until I was the color and it was me!  I began
to feel ill. I knew I should turn away, but Her strength was such that
I seemed incapable of the slightest movement.  Just when I thought I
would faint from terror, there was a tumultuous clap of thunder and I
realized that it was too late.  Goddess!  My entire being had been
consumed by Hers!

      The world began to change around me, and I found myself suddenly
back in time.  I witnessed firsthand the Tale of the Taliesin - which
heretofore I had always thought a mere fairytale - and watched in horror
as the Three Drops of Wisdom flew from the Cauldron and spilled onto
Gwion Bach, imbuing him with infinite knowledge.  I was taken on the
frenzied chase between Cerridwen and Gwion, and felt my mortal body
contort and twist with every shape that was shifted.  As the greyhound,
I tracked the hare who was Gwion.  My muscles flexed again, and I dove
into the water as the otter, chasing the salmon who just moments before,
had been the hare.  Gwion then took to the sky as a sparrow, and in
flight, I swiftly pursued him as the hawk.  I watched knowingly as
Gwion, thinking himself quite safe, smugly turned himself into a single
grain of wheat.  And it was I, who in sorrow and pleasure, shifted into
the black hen and supped upon that grain.  I felt the swell of pregnancy
and the pains of labor as I delivered the new-born babe.  For the very
first time, I began to understand...*really* understand!

      Suddenly, I was once again caught up in the rapid whirl of color.
There was a blinding streak of blue-black lightning and after a moment
of excruciating pain, I was hurled forcefully from the essence of the
Goddess and back into my own!  So frightening and traumatic was this
experience, I wasn't really sure whether I was alive or dead!  I drew a
long breath, blinked my eyes and gingerly flexed my toes.  Apparently,
I was allright and everything seemed to be working okay!  I quickly
dusted myself off and got to my feet.

      We stood looking at each other - I from the bank, and She from her
realm atop the water.  Unexpectedly, She opened Her hand and held it out
to me.  Inside were three drops of liquid, sparkling like diamonds in
the night.  She tossed Her hand to the North, and one of the drops
splashed into the water, forming a very large circle - the Circle of
Causes and Necessity.  I drank of  its earthy waters and tasted the
poignant flavor of lessons learned, as pieces of my life flashed before
my eyes.

      She cast a second drop to the West, and a smaller circle appeared: 
The Circle of Blessedness.  As I carefully sipped of its waters, my
spirit left my body and for a split second, stood on the water facing
the Wisdom Keeper before re-entering its physical realm.

      The third drop, She flung cautiously to the East.  From it, too, 
2419

a circle materialized - though much smaller than the rest: The Circle of
the Infinite.  As I bent to partake of its knowledge, She stopped me
with Her upraised hand.  I understood.  Gently, I dipped my finger into
the waters, and for a moment saw all the knowlege that is and ever will
be!

      At that very moment, She raised Her hands skyward and Her form
shifted into that of a great red dragon.   Opening Her arms, She moved 
to the South and lovingly gathered all three circles to Her breast.  The
winds gusted from all four directions again, their forces centered
toward the spot where She stood.  I watched as She twirled furiously in
the wind and in a matter of seconds, She was gone.  The winds died
quickly to a gentle breeze.  The brook which had been so deathly still,
quickly burst forth with new life.  All was as it had been.

      It was just after daybreak, and the promise of a new beginning was
well underway.  I sat on the cobblestone bridge to contemplate with awe
and wonder the night's events.  I felt exhilarated, happy and humbled
all at once!  I had been visited by the She, The Stirrer of the
Cauldron.  I had been devoured and rebirthed again from Her body!  I was
newly alive with the mysteries she had unfolded to me!  I finally
understood!  I jumped up from my seat and blew a kiss to the Triple
Goddess in thanksgiving, then happily skipped across the bridge.

      As I neared the path toward home, the sheep were being let into
the meadow for their morning repast.  One of them had strayed from the
flock and seemed to be coming in my direction.  I walked toward him in
an effort to herd him back to the others, and as I grew near, he raised
his head and looked at me.  Stroking him gently, I looked into his eyes
and saw a strange look - an odd look - a look of anticipation and
wariness.
