                                 PERSECUTION: ANCIENT AND MODERN  

              This is the  text of a talk entitled  PERSECUTION: ANCIENT AND MODERN.
              Written  by  Julia Phillips,  it was  presented  by Julia  and Matthew
              Sandow at  the Wiccan  Conference, Canberra,  September 1992,  and was
              illustrated with slides of medieval woodcuts, paintings and documents.


              To begin, an example of religious persecution:

              I  am told  that,  moved by  some foolish  urge,  they consecrate  and
              worship the head of a donkey, that  most abject of all animals.   This
              is a cult worthy of the customs from which it sprang! Others say  that
              they reverence the genitals of the presiding priest himself, and adore
              them as  though they were their  father's... As for  the initiation of
              new  members, the details are as disgusting  as they are well-known. A
              child,  covered in  dough to  deceive the  unwary, is  set before  the
              would-be  novice. The novice stabs  the child to  death with invisible
              blows;  indeed, he himself, deceived  by the coating  of dough, thinks
              his  stabs harmless. Then -  it's horrible! -  they hungrily drink the
              child's blood, and  compete with one another as they divide his limbs.
              Through this  victim they are bound  together; and the fact  that they
              all share the knowledge of the crime pledges them all to silence. Such
              holy rites are more  disgraceful than sacrilege. It is  well-known too
              what happens at their feasts.... On the feast day they forgather  with
              all their children,  sisters, mothers,  people of either  sex and  all
              ages. When the company is all aglow from feasting, and impure lust has
              been set  afire by  drunkenness, pieces  of meat are  thrown to  a dog
              fastened to  a  lamp. The  lamp,  which would  have been  a  betraying
              witness, is overturned and goes out. Now, in the dark so favourable to
              shameless behaviour,  they twine the  bonds of unnameable  passion, as
              chance  decides. And  so all  alike are  incestuous, if not  always in
              deed, at least by complicity; for  everything that is performed by one
              of them corresponds to the wishes of them all... Precisely the secrecy
              of this evil  religion proves  that all these  things, or  practically
              all, are true. (Minucius Felix: Octavius) 

              Although  the language is not modern, the description of the practices
              could have come straight from last week's "Picture" magazine! And this
              is the point  that I wish to  make; the facts of  persecution have not
              changed in almost 2,000 years,  for that piece was written in  the 2nd
              century AD. Moreover,  the religion it  condemns is Christianity,  not
              Paganism, for Paganism at  that time was the dominant  state religion.
              In fact  the author  is a  Christian apologist,  and is  attempting to
              rebuke what he  sees as  unfair criticism, by  parodying the  offences
              which Pagans accuse Christians of perpetrating.

              Persecution  of religious  minorities  is  quite  simply that;  it  is
              persecution by a large  body of people - generally those who represent
              "society"  - against a smaller  one; generally comprised  of those who
              have  either rejected, or  for one reason or  another, fall outside of
              the social "norm".

                                                                                1628          


              Let us look at the medieval picture of the  witch; society's scapegoat
              par excellence: here we see her - for it is most often "her" - an old,
              ugly woman,  most likely poor,  and most likely  on the fringe  of the
              society in  which she lives. This  is the stereotype of  the witch. We
              know it is false; we know it has no basis in fact;  however, it became
              an integral part of the mindset of medieval  Europe, and through fairy
              tales,  drama and literature, and more latterly, cinema, the media and
              television, it has remained  an integral image in modern  society. One
              has only to look to Roald Dahl's "Witches", or Frank Baum's "Wizard of
              Oz", for  proof of this.   It came as a  surprise to me  to learn that
              "The  Wizard  of Oz"  was in  fact  a deliberate  propaganda exercise,
              released just at  the beginning of World War II.  If you remember, the
              magic words are: "There's no place like home"; and where was "home"?
              Kansas! that epitome of the WASP culture.

              When looking at medieval persecution of heresy, the waters are muddied
              by  the many  different causes  and effects  which permeate  the whole
              matter. There was no single cause, and no single victim.  It is a fact
              that far  more women than men  were persecuted; there are  a number of
              reasons  for this, not least  that throughout this  period, Europe was
              engaged in one war after another - most notably The Crusades - and men
              were in rather short supply.  There were also several epidemics of the
              plague, not to mention  other diseases such as dysentery  and cholera,
              which in  the Middle  Ages were sure  killers. Another  reason is  the
              rampant  misogyny  which,  begun  with the  earliest  Christians,  has
              permeated their theology ever since:
                        "What else  is woman but  a foe to  friendship, an
                        inescapable  punishment, a necessary  evil, a nat-
                        ural  temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic
                        danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature,
                        painted in fair colours...  The word woman is used
                        to mean  the lust of the  flesh, as it is  said: I
                        have  found a woman more bitter  than death, and a
                        good woman more subject to  carnal lust... [Women]
                        are more credulous; and since the chief aim of the
                        devil is  to  corrupt faith,  therefore he  rather
                        attacks them  [than  men]... Women  are  naturally
                        more impressionable... They have slippery tongues,
                        and are unable to  conceal from their fellow-women
                        those  things  which by  evil  arts they  know....
                        Women are intellectually  like children... She  is
                        more  carnal than a man, as is clear from her many
                        carnal abominations... She is an imperfect animal,
                        she always deceives....  Therefore a wicked  woman
                        is by  her nature quicker  to waver in  her faith,
                        and  consequently  quicker  to  abjure  the faith,
                        which is  the root  of witchcraft.... Just  as th-
                        rough the first defect in  their intelligence they
                        are  more prone  to abjure  the faith;  so through
                        their second defect of inordinate affections and
                        passions they search for,  brood over, and inflict
                        various vengeances,  either  by witchcraft  or  by
                        some  other means....  Women also  have weak  mem-
                        ories; and it is a natural vice in them not to be
                        disciplined,  but  to  follow  their  own impulses
                        without  any sense of what is due... She is a liar
                        by nature... (Malleus Maleficarum, edited by
                        Jeffrey Russell).

                                                                                1629          


              It  is easy to  comprehend the persecution  of women when  one is con-
              fronted with such obvious hatred and fear of the sex.  But perhaps the
              most powerful impetus of the witch trials era is one which is subtly -
              and  sometimes not so subtly!  - present in all the  trials; that of a
              pursuit of power  or wealth. For an  example we can look  to Gilles de
              Rais, who  as the wealthiest man in  Europe (as well as  Joan of Arc's
              military Captain), was  a prime victim  for a charge of  heresy. Found
              guilty,  his  lands, properties  and  wealth were  confiscated  by his
              accusers.  Curiously though he was buried on consecrated ground in the
              Churchyard; normally forbidden to heretics.  In  "The Encyclopaedia of
              Witchcraft and Demonology", Russell Hope Robbins says:

                        "At  first, Gilles dismissed  their accusations as
                        "frivolous  and  lacking credit",  but  so certain
                        were the principals of  finding him guilty that on
                        September 3, fifteen days  before the trial began,
                        the Duke disposed of  his anticipated share of the
                        Rais  lands.   Under  these  circumstances, it  is
                        difficult  to place  any credence in  the evidence
                        against him, among the most fantastic and obscene
                        presented in this Encyclopaedia."

              Charges included the now obligatory conjurations  of devils and demons
              - Satan, Beelzebub,  Orion and Belial are mentioned by  name - and the
              practice of that  dreadful art:  geomancy! And of  course the  charges
              included human sacrifice and paedophilia; no self-respecting Christian
              could exclude these crimes from charges against a confirmed heretic!

              There were not many who had the wealth of Gilles de Rais, but in
              a small parish, even the meanest property was eagerly seized, and
              the  witch hunts became a  profitable business. The  victims were even
              required to pay for the fuel upon which they were burnt.  But the laws
              were  not  consistent throughout  Europe, and  in  some areas,  if the
              victim confessed, then his  or her property could not  be confiscated,
              but  was inherited by the next of  kin. However, many of these victims
              were  in fact  devout Christians,  who would  be  loath to  confess to
              heresy  just so that their family could  inherit their land! Of course
              many were  tortured to the point  were they would admit  to being any-
              thing demanded of them,  although technically, they were only  allowed
              to be tortured once. This is why you will read in trials  records that
              the  torture was "continued", which, of course, gets round the problem
              of the poor torturer missing out on his lunch and dinner.

              Although most heretics were  women, a great many men were  also taken,
              tortured,  and put to death. This is a  letter from one such victim at
              the notorious Bamberg in  Germany; a poignant  epitaph to one of  Eur-
              ope's most hideous crimes:

                        Many hundred thousand good-nights,  dearly beloved
                        daughter Veronica. Innocent have I come into pris-
                        on, innocent have I been tortured, innocent must I
                        die. For whoever comes  into the witch prison must
                        become  a witch  or be  tortured until  he invents
                        something out of  his head  - and God  pity him  -
                        bethinks him of something.

                        I  said: "I  have  never renounced  God, and  will
                        never do it - God graciously keep me from it. I'll
                        rather bear whatever I must."

                                                                      1630                    

                        And then  came also -  God in highest  heaven have
                        mercy  - the executioner,  and put the thumbscrews
                        on  me, both  hands  bound together,  so that  the
                        blood spurted from the nails and everywhere,
                        so that for four  weeks I could not use  my hands,
                        as you  can see  from my writing.  Thereafter they
                        stripped me, bound my hands behind me, and drew me
                        up  on the ladder. Then I thought heaven and earth
                        were  at an end. Eight  times did they  draw me up
                        and let me fall again, so that I suffered terrible
                        agony.

                        All  this happened  on Friday  June 30th  and with
                        God's help I had to bear the torture. When at last
                        the executioner led me back into the cell, he said
                        to me: "Sir, I beg you, for God's sake, confess
                        something, whether it be true or not. Invent some-
                        thing, for  you cannot bear the  torture which you
                        will be put to; and, even if you bear it  all, yet
                        you will not escape, not even if you were an earl,
                        but one torture will  follow another until you say
                        you are a witch."

              The  author of  this letter,  Johannes Junius,  did indeed  confess to
              being a  witch, and in  August of 1628, was  burned at the  stake.  He
              managed  to send  his final  letter to  his  daughter, which  ended by
              saying:

                        Dear child, keep this  letter secret, so that peo-
                        ple  do not find it, else I shall be tortured most
                        piteously and  the jailers  will be beheaded.   So
                        strictly is  it forbidden... Dear  child, pay this
                        man a thaler... I have taken several days to write
                        this - my hands are both  crippled.  I am in a sad
                        plight. Good night, for your  father Johannes Jun-
                        ius will never see you more.

              This  letter describes  more accurately  than any  historical treatise
              just how uncompromising the ecclesiastical courts were in their
              hunt for heretics. Witches, of course, were only one kind of heretic.

              I mentioned earlier that  there are many causes, and  many effects, to
              the period which  is commonly referred to  as "The Burning  Times", or
              the Great  Witch Hunt. It is  often assumed by many  people today that
              Christianity  has been the dominant  western religion for 2,000 years.
              This is  not so. The death  of Christ, which probably  occurred in the
              year AD  30, may have heralded  the new religion, but  there was cert-
              ainly  not an immediate conversion of the world to Christianity. Parts
              of Scandinavia remained wholly  Pagan until as late  as the 12th  cen-
              tury. The British Isles  and mainland Europe were converted  to Chris-
              tianity  over a lengthy  period covering  mainly the  4th to  9th cen-
              turies.  Some  parts have  never truly  been  converted, and  with the
              opening  up of the Eastern bloc countries, we are now re-discovering a
              wealth  of Pagan  tradition  and folklore  that  has been  hidden  for
              hundreds of  years:   initially from  the invading  Christian mission-
              aries, and then later from the various communist regimes.

                                                                                1631          


              As the new religion of Christianity began to spread, many different
              sects and  cults appeared within its  ranks. The Pope in  Rome was the
              nominal head, but rarely was the Pope a person of spiritual purity and
              ascetic tastes; the political scene in Rome has always been cut-throat
              and devious. A truly spiritual person  would have lasted approximately
              two seconds  amongst the clever  and calculating  politicians who  in-
              fested the Papal See! The enormous wealth and power controlled  by the
              Pope was an incentive to the most grasping  and corrupt of men at that
              time to aspire to the Papacy. Pope Alexander VI (1492) is a superb ex-
              ample of the type who  made it to Europe's foremost political  seat of
              power:  otherwise known as Rodrigo Borgia; father (yes, we all know
              Catholics practise celibacy!) of Cesare, Juan, Lucrezia and Jofre,
              and supreme commander  of a private army of  which any modern dictator
              would be proud.

              Because of their sumptuous lifestyle, their obvious disregard and
              contempt for vows of poverty and chastity, and their abuse of the
              spiritual authority invested in them, many spiritually inclined
              Christians rejected the Catholic Church, and instead followed
              leaders who lived simple, ascetic lives in accordance with the
              teachings of Christ. Some of these sects became very popular,
              and were soon perceived by the Pope as a threat to his status and
              power. It has been suggested that the witch trials were a direct
              result from the persecution of these sects. Rather than incorporate a
              discussion of the different sects within this talk, handouts are
              available which very briefly describe the main ones.

              The main thrust was against the Cathars or Albigensians, and the
              Waldensians (Vaudois), and it was their persecution which gave rise to
              the legal  machinery which  developed into  the  Inquisition, and  the
              so-called witch hunts.  It began with Pope Lucius III and the emperor,
              Frederick I  Barbarossa; they met  at Verona  in 1184, and  issued the
              decree "Ad abolendam", which excommunicated sects like the Cathars and
              Waldensians, and  laid down  the procedures for  ecclesiastical trial,
              after which the accused  would be handed  over to the secular  author-
              ities  for  punishment. The  punishment  decreed  was confiscation  of
              property,  exile, or death.  By the  12th century, burning had already
              become  the established means of  execution for heretics,  and so this
              became enshrined in law.

              At  the beginning of the  13th century, the  Dominican Order of Friars
              was  established, and  its  members were  instructed  by the  Pope  to
              investigate  and prosecute heresy. From this simple beginning grew the
              awesome  machinery  of the  Inquisition,  which  although never  aimed
              particularly  at witches,  became  a byword  for  terror in  parts  of
              Europe.

              As you  can see, the motives  for the heresy persecutions  were not to
              stamp out Paganism - although that was certainly a by-product - but
              to remove the threat of any competition to the power of the Church
              (and thus to the Pope), in Rome. And the greatest threat came from
              other "Christian" sects, not the Pagans. The change from an accusatory
              to an inquisitorial  process became established,  and the legal  mach-
              inery which allowed  - indeed encouraged -  individual psychopaths and
              religious maniacs to persecute at will, was in place.

                                                                                1632          


              Have you  got a neighbour  who annoys  you? plays loud  music, or  who
              keeps their smelly refuse next to your garden fence? Now your recourse
              is to the local council or the police; in  the Middle Ages, you simply
              denounced the  offender as a witch or heretic, and let the Church deal
              with them  for you.  Not only  did it  cost you  nothing, if  you were
              lucky, you might also inherit their property!

              For once you  were taken  as a witch  or a heretic,  there was  little
              chance of escape.  Certainly some victims were  pardoned and released,
              but the vast majority were  not so lucky. When you consider  the style
              of questioning, this is not surprising:

              1     How long have you been a witch?

              2     Why did you become a witch?

              3     How did you become a witch and what happened on that occasion?

              4     Who is the one you chose to be your incubus? What was his name?

              5     What was the name of your master among the evil demons?

              6     What was the oath you were forced to render to him?

              21    What animals have you bewitched to sickness and death, and
                    why did you commit such acts?

              22    Who are your accomplices in evil...?

              24    What is the ointment with which you rub your broomstick
                    made of...?

              This  set of questions came  from Lorraine, and  was used consistently
              throughout the three centuries  of the main persecutions.   Bearing in
              mind that  the accused HAD to answer - no  answer at all, or a denial,
              was tantamount to guilt - you can see how easily the composite picture
              of the witch evolved.  As Rossell Hope Robbins says:  "The confessions
              of witches authenticated the experts, and the denunciations ensured  a
              continuing  supply  of victims.  Throughout  France  and Germany  this
              procedure became  standardised; repeated year  after year, in  time it
              built  up a  huge mass  of "evidence", all  duly authorised,  from the
              mouths of the accused. On these confessions, later demonologists based
              their compendiums and so formulated the classic conceptions of witchc-
              raft, which never existed save in their own minds."

              As the new religion of Christianity began to spread, many different
              sects and  cults appeared within its  ranks. The Pope in  Rome was the
              nominal head, but rarely was the Pope a person of spiritual purity and
              ascetic tastes; the political scene in Rome has always been cut-throat
              and devious. A truly spiritual person  would have lasted approximately
              two seconds  amongst the clever  and calculating  politicians who  in-
              fested  the Papal See! The enormous wealth and power controlled by the
              Pope was an incentive to the most grasping and corrupt of men  at that
              time to aspire to the Papacy. Pope Alexander VI (1492) is a superb ex-
              ample of the type who  made it to Europe's foremost political  seat of
              power:  otherwise known as Rodrigo Borgia; father (yes, we all know
              Catholics practise celibacy!) of Cesare, Juan, Lucrezia and Jofre,
              and supreme commander of a  private army of which any  modern dictator
              would be proud.

                                                                                1633          

              It is also rather disturbing to discover just how important individual
              religious maniacs appear to have been in the persecutions. Rather like
              today, where  a crusading  tele-journalist, or evangelical  vicar, can
              cause untold  harm to innocent people. Without exception, these accus-
              ations  are  by those  with an  unhealthy  mania against  anyone whose
              theology  or practices  differ from  their own.  In the  words of  one
              modern evangelist:  "if you're not  fighting and winning,  you're los-
              ing.".

              Conrad of Marburg, described by Norman Cohn as, "a blind fanatic", was
              a  severe  and formidable  persecutor. As  confessor  to the  young 21
              year-old  Countess of Thuringia, he would trick her into "some trivial
              and unwitting disobedience, and then have her and her maids flogged so
              severely  that the  scars were  visible weeks  later". (Cohn).  Conrad
              became Germany's first official Inquisitor, and his zeal in denouncing
              heretics was  unsurpassed. Another Conrad, a  lay-Dominican Friar, and
              his sidekick Johannes,  were also vigorous in denouncing  heretics. As
              they  moved from village to village, they  claimed to be able to iden-
              tify a  heretic by his or  her appearance, based on  nothing but their
              own  intuition. They were responsible for the burnings of many people,
              and said, "we would gladly burn a hundred if just one among them were
              guilty". (Annales Wormantiensis).

              Their comment about appearance is an important one; as we saw earlier,
              the stereotype of the witch hasn't changed much in hundreds of  years.
              We know it is false; we know that it exists only in the imagination of
              the persecutors, and yet how powerful and enduring this stereotype has
              proven to be.

              If we think about this stereotype,  what images do we conjure up?   An
              old woman -  occasionally an old man; or perhaps  a young and alluring
              temptress?  Flying through  the  air on  a  broomstick; worshipping  a
              devil, often in the form of a goat; trampling upon  the sacred symbols
              of Christianity; and  of course our  old friend  the Sabbat, with  its
              practices  of  sexual  license,  debauchery,  drunkenness  and  ritual
              murder; the latter often of children.

              But persecution does not restrict itself to witches; the similarities
              between this stereotype and that of the Jew are obvious: Jews have
              been persecuted throughout their history, but it is interesting to
              compare some aspects of their persecution with that of witches.

              In the 12th century, the word  "Synagogue" was used for the first time
              to  describe the  meeting place  of  heretics. Professor  Russell says
              that:  "This usage, obviously designed  to spite the  Jews, was common
              throughout the Middle Ages, being replaced only towards the end of the
              15th century by the equally anti-Jewish term 'sabbat'.

              The Encyclopaedia Britannica says on the subject of Jewish persecution
              that: "To  reinforce racial and religious  prejudice, the preposterous
              ritual murder accusation  became common  from the  12th century."  The
              third and fourth Lateran Councils had already prohibited gentiles from
              entering  Jewish  service, or  being  employed  by  Jews, and  further
              ordered that Jews  should wear a distinctive  badge, and live  only in
              Jewish  settlement  areas. This  of course  was  the beginning  of the
              ghetto.

                                                                                1634          


              As we have seen though, the ritual murder accusation  was already over
              a thousand  years old, before it  was used against either  the Jews or
              the heretics  and witches. Most people  know of the  expulsion of Jews
              from Spain in the 15th  century, but perhaps not so commonly  known is
              that for about  200 years prior  to the expulsion,  the Jews had  been
              massacred and persecuted.  Indeed, it  was against the  Jews that  the
              infamous Spanish  Inquisition of  the 15th century  was directed.  The
              persecution  of Jews  in  20th century  Europe  is too  well-known  to
              require further comment  here, but  perhaps a few  comments about  its
              encouragement would be useful.

              We are discussing  persecution in  this talk, and  how persecution  is
              manifested. Throughout  history, the written word  has been invaluable
              as a  means of  spreading  propaganda. Even  in  the Middle  Ages  the
              "crimes"  of the heretic were  publicised by records  of trials, where
              the  "confessions" were made known to the general public. The infamous
              "Malleus  Maleficarum"  became  highly  influential  in  Europe mainly
              because  its  publication  coincided  with the  introduction  of  mass
              printing.  It had little effect in England because no English transla-
              tion  was available until 1928. This fact alone demonstrates the power
              of the written word.

              In  medieval Europe, a pamphlet  describing the crimes  of a convicted
              heretic  would be pinned to a  post in the town  square, and those who
              could not  read had it read to them. In 20th century Europe, pamphlets
              were  still used  by one  group to  spread lies  about another.  As we
              approach  the 21st  century, this  technique is  still used  with very
              great success; for the persecutor needs to make only a glancing nod to
              the truth, and the lies which are published (or more frequently broad-
              cast) are far more scandalous than the reality!

              An example: soon after the launch  of the Pagan Alliance, Sydney radio
              2MMM broadcasted a  news story about the  sexual abuse of children  by
              occultists and witches.  Matthew responded  immediately, and  provided
              the  station  with copy  documents  and news  clippings  from Britain,
              proving the story to be without foundation, and a scheme by the Chris-
              tian  fundamentalists to discredit  Pagans. The news  editor and chief
              journalist  were impressed by the  material, and agreed  that they had
              been used by the fundies. However, they refused to broadcast a retrac-
              tion because it  would be "old news".   So, the damage had  been done,
              and the fundamentalists achieved their objective.

              This technique was used with very great effect in the early part of
              the 20th century, with the circulation of a pamphlet called, "The
              Protocols of the Elders of Zion". This purported to be, "an account
              of  the World Congress  of Jewry held  in Basel, Switzerland  in 1897,
              during which  a conspiracy  was  planned by  the international  Jewish
              movement and the Freemasons to achieve world domination." (M Howard).

              German nationalists made very great use of the Protocols, which it
              was  claimed were "smuggled out of Switzerland by a Russian journalist
              who  had placed the  documents in the  safe keeping of  the Rising Sun
              Masonic Lodge in Frankfurt." (ibid) They were widely disseminated, and
              writing in  "Mein Kampf", Hitler "denounced  the Jews as agents  of an
              international conspiracy devoted  to world  domination...". (ibid)  We
              all know what happened next.  

                                                                                1635          


              The point  is that although the Protocols were confirmed as a fraud in
              1921, they continued to have an effect, and once published, could  not
              effectively be  retracted. This is  the aim of  today's fundamentalist
              Christian, who  believes that if he or she throws enough dirt at their
              opponents (basically anyone who  does not agree with  their uncomprom-
              ising version of Christianity),  then some will stick, and  the battle
              will be won. This is the strategy which has been used for thousands of
              years  to persecute minorities, and  has always been  successful.  The
              formula  is  simple: discover  what most  people  fear most,  and then
              accuse your enemies of practising it.  It is an interesting comment on
              humanity that those things which occur time and time again are consis-
              tent: conspiracy, buggery,  paedophilia, sacrifice (human  and animal)
              sexual  license,  drunkenness and  feasting.    More specific  charges
              relating to  a pact  with a  devil or desecrating  sacred objects  are
              additions to these core accusations.

              A further interesting aspect is that many of the accusations were
              made by children; interesting parallels can be drawn to modern accusa-
              tions by  children "encouraged" to reveal  information about occultism
              and  witches. It has been  widely recorded that  Hitler's "Youth Army"
              required  children to spy upon their parents, and report any indiscre-
              tions; modern social workers use  an identical process for identifying
              Pagan parents  - children are  asked about what their  parents do, and
              leading questions are commonly used.  And of course there have  always
              been children  who, for one reason or another, tell the most fantastic
              tales. It is unlikely  today that the victims of these child fantasies
              will be burned at the stake,  but there have been families torn apart,
              children  placed in detention  centres, and untold  misery for parents
              and children alike,  based upon no  more than the  verbal report of  a
              child.

              Commentators on this  aspect of  persecution have  suggested that  the
              children wish to be the centre of attention; or to direct punishment
              for their own misdeeds elsewhere; or are simply reacting in a hyperac-
              tive manner to  the onset of puberty. Whatever  the cause, the effects
              are  dramatic, and  have caused  severe suffering,  and in  the middle
              ages, loss of life, on many occasions.

              In medieval England, there were many occasions where children's "evid-
              ence" (sic) was  used to  convict witches. "The  Leicester Boy",  "The
              Burton  Boy" and "The Bilson Boy" were a few of many who claimed to be
              bewitched by witches.  Eventually proven to be  a fraud, at  least ten
              women died  as a result of  the accusations of The  Leicester Boy, and
              the Burton Boy  caused the death of at least one  of the women whom he
              accused. In  the 17th century a  number of women were  executed on the
              allegations  of  hysterical  children,  even though  fraud  was  often
              discovered  during the  course of  the trial.  It is  a fact  that the
              delusions  of delinquent  or  disturbed children  were  often used  by
              judges  to confirm their own prejudices; how little things have chang-
              ed!

                                                                                1636          


              Salem (1692)  is probably the best known of all the cases where child-
              ren were the  chief accusers.  Although in fact,  the "children"  were
              more like young adults, with only  one under the age of ten,  and most
              in their late teens or  early twenties. However, as the panic  grew, a
              great  many more were sucked into the  web of lies, and Martha Carrier
              was hanged on the "evidence" (sic)  of her 7 year-old daughter. At the
              height of  the hysteria  almost 150 people  were arrested;  thirty-one
              were convicted, and nineteen hung.  Some died in jail, and others were
              reprieved. As was common in Europe,  the accused were required to  pay
              their  expenses whilst in jail,  even if they  were subsequently found
              innocent. Sarah Osborne and Ann Foster both died in jail, and costs of
              .1 3s  5d and .2 16s  0d respectively were demanded  before the bodies
              would be released for burial.

              The  chief of the accusers, Ann Putnam, confessed fourteen years later
              that  the whole thing  was a fraud.  In 1697 the  jurors publicly con-
              fessed they  had made an error  of judgement, and ten  years after the
              executions, Judge  Samuel Sewall  "confessed the  guilt of  the court,
              desiring  to take the blame and shame of  it...". By then of course it
              was too late  for those who were  dead, or whose lives had  been dest-
              royed by the accusations.

              But we  are getting ahead of ourselves here,  for Salem is the last of
              the great witch trials, coming as it does towards the end of the 17th
              century.

              We mentioned earlier that in Continental Europe, the heresy trials
              appeared to arise from the persecution of the Christian sects of the
              Bogomils, Cathars, Albigensians, and others such as the Jews,  Walden-
              sians,  and even the Knights Templars. The stereotype of the witch was
              compounded  from  many different  sources,  and  gradually became  the
              composite figure of the  shape-shifting hag, who flew through  the air
              on a broom, and flung her curses at all and sundry.

              The concept of the pact with the devil existed as early as the 8th
              century, and as we have seen, sexual license, buggery and ritual
              sacrifice have long been seen as activities supposed to be practised
              by those outside of society's norm, whether they be Christian or
              Pagan. During the 9th century, shape-shifting, maleficia and the
              incubus/succubus became more  commonly reported, and by  the 10th cen-
              tury, the idea of nocturnal flight was established.  Published in 906,
              the Canon Episcopi described how some women were deluded in the belief
              that at  night they could  fly behind  their Goddess, Diana  (Holda or
              Herodias):

                        "Some wicked women are  perverted by the Devil and
                        led astray by  illusions and fantasies  induced by
                        demons,  so that  they  believe they  ride out  at
                        night on beasts with Diana, the pagan goddess, and
                        a horde of women.  They believe that in  the night
                        they cross huge distances. They say that they obey
                        Diana's commands and on certain nights are  called
                        out in her service..."

                                                                                1637          


              Echoes here to Maddalena's story recounted by Leland in Aradia: Gospel
              of the Witches:

                          "Oncein the month, and when the moon is full, ye
                        shall assemble in some desert place,  or in a for-
                        est all  together join to adore  the potent spirit
                        of your Queen, my mother, great Diana". 

              Carlo Ginzburg has also published a remarkable book about the Witches'
              Sabbath, and  the night flight,  where he  suggests that these  are in
              fact  based on  genuinely ancient shamanic  practices; nothing  new in
              this  concept to modern Witches, but  a novel observation in the acad-
              emic circles in which Ginzburg moves.

              In  1012, Burchard's Collectarium was published:  the first attempt to
              assemble a  book of Canonical Law. Book number 19 of this vast collec-
              tion was called  the Corrector,  and chapter five  deals with  various
              sins, and their respective penances. As we might suppose, Maleficia is
              prominent in  this chapter! It  enshrines in law  the notion of  night
              flight,  together with  murder, and  the cooking  and eating  of human
              flesh. Although both the  Canon Episcopi and Burchard's Corrector  are
              specific in attributing  the powers of  flight to  Witches, it is  not
              until  1280 that  the first  picture of  a witch  riding upon  a broom
              appears. This is found in Schleswig Cathedral.

              In 1022, the first burning occurred: at Orleans, the victims were
              accused of, "holding sex orgies at night in a secret place, either
              underground  or in  an abandoned  building. The  members of  the group
              appeared bearing torches. Holding the torches, they chanted the  names
              of  demons until an evil  spirit appeared. Now  the lights were extin-
              guished, and  everyone seized  the person closest  to him in  a sexual
              embrace,  whether mother, sister or nun. The children conceived at the
              orgies  were burned  eight  days after  birth,  and their  ashes  were
              confected in a substance that was then used in a blasphemous parody of
              holy communion."

              Strange how  these charges appear to have changed so little in so many
              years!  Compared with our first  example, and indeed  with the accusa-
              tions of modern day fundamentalists, one would be forgiven for believ-
              ing that time is a  figment of our imagination, and that  nothing ever
              really changes; certainly not human nature.

              The 14th  century saw a steady growth in the number of accusations and
              trials, and by the 15th century, the idea of the  Devil's (or Witch's)
              mark had become established. So too was the idea of a flying ointment,
              and  a consistent image  of The Devil  became common in  trials liter-
              ature.

              The Papal Bull of  1484, Summis Desiderantes Affectibus, and  then two
              years later, publication of the Malleus Maleficarum, further establis-
              hed the "crime" of witchcraft as a heresy, and confirmed Papal support
              for its  eradication. This infamous work - The Hammer of the Witches -
              was incredibly influential in establishing a code of practice by which
              witches were to be denounced, tried, convicted and executed. There was
              no escape  from this dreadful fate.  The third part of  the book desc-
              ribes how to deal with one who will not confess to the charges:

                        "But if the accused, after  a year or other longer
                        period which has been deemed sufficient, continues

                                                                      1638                    

                        to maintain his denials,  and the legitimate  wit-
                        nesses abide by their evidence, the Bishop and
                        Judges shall prepare to abandon him to the secular
                        Court; sending  to him certain  honest men zealous
                        for the  faith, especially religious, to  tell him
                        that he cannot escape temporal death while he thus
                        persists in  his denial, but will  be delivered up
                        as  an impenitent heretic to the power of the sec-
                        ular Court.

              It is also in this section that our friendly Dominican monks refer to,
              "witch  midwives, who surpass all other witches in their crimes... And
              the number of them is so great that, as has been found from their con-
              fessions, it  is thought  that there is  scarcely any  tiny hamlet  in
              which at least one is not to be found."

              Despite its  incredible influence  in Europe, the  Malleus had  little
              effect in England, Wales or Ireland, where witchcraft accusations
              and trials were very different to those of the continent and Scotland.
              In fact Wales and Ireland seemed to escape from the witch persecutions
              almost entirely, with very few trials, and even fewer executions.

              Although many  laws have been  enacted in England  against witchcraft,
              there has never been  anything like the hysteria about  witches common
              in  mainland Europe. The earliest  known person accused  of sorcery in
              England was Agnes, wife of  Odo, who in 1209 was freed  after choosing
              trial by ordeal of grasping a red-hot iron.

              Until 1563, commoners accused  of witchcraft in England met  light (if
              any) punishment. Those of noble birth were treated rather more severe-
              ly,  as the crime could easily be one of treason, and any action which
              implied a threat  to the  monarch was treated  very seriously  indeed.
              This resulted in the charge of  witchcraft being used to remove polit-
              ical  opponents  with  great  expediency. There  were  certainly  laws
              against  the  practice of  witchcraft  or  sorcery:  Alfred the  Great
              (849-899  AD), King  of Wessex  and overlord  of England,  decreed the
              death penalty  for Wiccans (that was  the word he  actually used), and
              Aethelstan - perhaps  one of  the most compassionate  of Saxon  Kings,
              ordered  those who practised Wiccecraeft  to be executed,  but only if
              their activities resulted in murder.

              Under Henry VIII's Act of 1546, the penalty for conjuration of evil
              spirits was death, and the property of the accused was confiscated
              by the King. However, this was in effect for only one year, being
              repealed by Edward VI in 1547, and only one conviction under this
              Act is  recorded. In 1563,  the statute of  Queen Elizabeth I  was es-
              tablished, which also made death the penalty for invoking or conjuring
              an evil spirit, but those who practised divination, or who caused harm
              (other  than death)  by their  sorceries, were  sentenced to  a year's
              imprisonment for a first offence. Subsequent offences could be punish-
              able  by death, and  in some  cases, the  confiscation of  property as
              well.

                                                                                1639          


              However, even though laws against the practice of witchcraft had
              been established for hundreds of years, the first major trial was not
              until 1566, at Chelmsford, and was typical of the English style of
              witchcraft: no pact with the devil, no gathering at Sabbats, but
              simple and direct acts of maleficia, and the introduction of witches'
              familiars. It was an important trial, for it set the precedent in
              English law for accepting unsupported, and highly imaginative, stories
              from  children as evidence. It  also accepted spectral evidence (sic),
              witch's marks, and the confession of the accused.

              There are  some very distinctive aspects to  English witchcraft, which
              set it apart from its Continental and Scottish counterparts, and which
              are worth  noting. There was a relative lack of torture, and, this may
              come as  a surprise to some  people, but witches were  never burned in
              England. Traitors  and murderers were  burned; witches  were hung.  Of
              course, a traitor or a  murderer could also be  a witch, but this  was
              actually quite rare. The torture used in England - when it was used at
              all - was typically swimming, pricking, enforced waking, and a diet of
              bread  and water.  Unpleasant, but when compared to squassation, being
              skinned  alive,  the strappado,  the rack,  and  such delights  as the
              thumbscrews and the  iron maiden, hardly in the same  class. The focus
              of  English witchcraft  was  more towards  simple,  personal, acts  of
              maleficia  than a perceived conspiracy against the power of the Chris-
              tian Church.  As one of  Britain's foremost  folklorists says:  "Trad-
              itions  of an organised, pagan witch-cult were never very plentiful in
              England, although they did exist occasionally, especially in the later
              years of  the witch belief. They  were never really strong,  and after
              the end of the persecution in the early 18th century, they disappeared
              altogether."   (Christina  Hole) This is  interesting, because  it has
              been suggested that the witch trials phenomena was largely inspired by
              the heretical Christian sects; this  would seem to be born out  by the
              type  of  accusations made  in England,  which were  largely neighbour
              against neighbour  rather than Church  and State against  an organised
              conspiracy of heretics.

              What is also interesting is  that it was commonly believed  in England
              that if the  bewitched victim  could draw blood  from the witch,  then
              they  would be  cured, and  the witch's  power made  ineffective. This
              belief has persisted in folk  traditions to modern times. In 1875,  at
              Long Compton,  the body of an  old woman, one Ann  Turner, was discov-
              ered. She had  been pinned to  the ground by  a pitchfork through  her
              throat, and across her face  and chest had been  carved the sign of  a
              crucifix. James Heywood, a  local farmer, had once claimed:  "It's she
              who  brings the floods and drought.   Her spells withered the crops in
              the field.  Her curse drove  my father  to an  early grave!".  Heywood
              maintained  that the only  way to destroy  her power was  to spill her
              blood, and so after her murder, he was  taken and tried for the crime.
              He was convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Long Compton has
              always been associated with the practice of witchcraft, and is located
              only a short distance from  the magical Rollright Stones, and near  to
              the aptly  named Wychwood Forest. The derivation  of this name is from
              the curiously named tribe of THE HWICCE,  who lived in the area at the
              time of King Penda of Mercia, and who seemed always to be ruled by two
              brothers. But back to Long Compton:              

                                                                                1640          


              In 1945, Charles Walton, a  local labourer, set out one morning  to do
              some hedging on nearby Meon Hill. That evening, his mutilated body was
              found in a field -  pinned to the ground  by his pitchfork, which  had
              been stuck through his throat.  There were cuts to his arms  and legs,
              and local police were baffled as to  the motive for the crime, and who
              the likely culprit might have been. But gradually locals began to talk
              about Mr Walton; they said  he was a solitary and vindictive  old man,
              who was concerned more  with searching out the secrets  of nature than
              in taking company  with his  neighbours. They said  that he  harnessed
              toads, using reeds and pieces of ram's horn, and then sent them across
              fields  to  blight the  crops.  They also  remembered that  he  kept a
              witch's mirror - a piece of  black stone polished in a mountain stream
              - concealed in his pocket-watch, which he used for weaving spells  and
              seeing into the future.  The police never discovered the  culprit, but
              it was accepted locally that Mr Walton was murdered because he was a
              witch. His wounds were a result of the belief that a victim could be
              freed from enchantment if he or she were able to draw the blood of
              the witch.

              We could not leave English witchcraft without mention of that infamous
              gentleman, Matthew Hopkins; self-styled  Witchfinder General. For  all
              his fame, his activities  were restricted to a relatively  small area,
              and a relatively short period of time.  However, his boundless energy,
              and boundless enthusiasm for the collection of large amounts of money,
              ensured that his name has not been forgotten.

              Matthew Hopkins  used the  unrest of  the Civil War  to prey  upon the
              fears of  the common people. Little is known of his early life, except
              that he became a lawyer "of little note", and failing to make a living
              at Ipswich  in Suffolk,  moved to  Manningtree in Essex  - an  area of
              Civil War tension.

              With virtually no knowledge of witchcraft, but  armed with a couple of
              contemporary documents (including James I's "Demonology"), Hopkins set
              himself up in business  as a witchfinder.  And a very profitable  bus-
              iness  it was  too. At  a time  when the  average daily  wage  was 6d,
              Hopkins received  .23 for a single  visit to Stowmarket, and  .6 for a
              visit to Aldeburgh.

              His  approach  was consistent:  James  I  mentioned that  witches  had
              familiars, and suckled imps; therefore, anyone who kept a familiar
              spirit or imp must be a  witch! Bearing in mind the English partiality
              to keeping  pets, and you begin  to see just how  very successful this
              technique  could be.  For example,  Bridget Mayers  was  condemned for
              entertaining an  evil spirit in  the likeness  of a  mouse, which  she
              called "Prickears"; another (unnamed) woman was rescued  by her neigh-
              bours from  a ducking,  where she  confessed to having  an imp  called
              "Nan". When  she recovered she said:  "she knew not what  she had con-
              fessed,  and she  had nothing  she called  Nan but  a pullet  that she
              sometimes called by that name...".

              Hopkins  moved from Essex to Norfolk and Suffolk, and by the following
              year, had  operations in  Cambridge, Northampton, Huntingdon  and Bed-
              ford, with a team of six  witch finders under his control. "In Suffolk
              alone it is estimated  that he was responsible for arresting  at least
              124 persons  for witchcraft, of  whom at least 68  were hanged." (RHR)
              However, Hopkins moved too  far too quickly, and public  opinion began
              to go against him. In 1646, a clergyman in Huntingdon preached against
              him, and judges began  to question both his  methods of locating  wit-

                                                                                1641          

              ches, and  the fees that he  charged for the service.  In 1647 Hopkins
              published a pamphlet called  "Discovery of Witches", in which  he sup-
              ported his methods in sanctimonious and pseudo legal language.  Howev-
              er, it  was to no  avail, for later that  year he died,  "in some dis-
              grace" according to most authorities. Witchcraft legend has it that he
              was drowned  by irate villagers in  one of his own  ducking ponds, but
              this has no recorded evidence to support it. However, it would be a
              fitting end to such an evil man, and I hope it was true.

              Moving away from England; Scottish and Continental witchcraft shared a
              great many similarities;  Mary Queen of Scots, and her  son, James VI,
              were  both educated  in  France,  and  this ensured  that  continental
              attitudes  towards  witches  were enshrined  in  Scottish  law  at the
              highest level. In fact the concepts of witchcraft were introduced into
              Scotland by Mary in about 1563. Before then, trials for witchcraft had
              been few,  and there  were no  recorded burnings  of witches. In  "The
              Encyclopaedia of Witchcraft and Demonology" Rossell Hope Robbins says:

                        "Scotland is  second only  to Germany in  the bar-
                        barity of its witch trials. The Presbyterian cler-
                        gy acted like inquisitors, and the Church sessions
                        often shared the prosecution with the secular law
                        courts. The Scottish laws were, if  anything, more
                        heavily loaded against  the accused. Finally,  the
                        devilishness of  the torture was  limited only  by
                        Scotland's backward technology in the construction
                        of mechanical devices."

              It is  well known that James  VI was an ardent  prosecutor of witches,
              and  it  was under  his  authority that  the  Bible was  translated to
              include the word "witch"  (Exodus 22:18) to provide Biblical  sanction
              for the death  penalty for witches. The original Hebrew word - kashaph
              - meant either a magician, diviner or sorcerer, but was definitely not
              a witch. In  the Latin Vulgate (4th century version  of the Bible) the
              word had been translated as "maleficos", which could mean  any kind of
              criminal, although in practice often referred to malevolent sorcerers.
              Similarly, the  so-called Witch of  Endor, consulted by  King Solomon:
              the  original Hebrew was "ba'alath  ob": "mistress of  a talisman". In
              the Latin Vulgate she  became a "mulierem habentem pythonem":  a women
              possessing an oracular spirit. It was only in the version of the Bible
              authorised by King James that she became a witch.

              By the time that James acceded to the English throne in 1603, his
              attitude towards witches had undergone a subtle transformation. In
              fact,  he was  directly  responsible for  the  release and  pardon  of
              several accused "witches", and personally interfered in trials where
              he believed that fraud or deception was being practised.  However,
              Lynn Linton writing in 1861 says of him:

                        "Whatever of blood-stained folly belonged special-
                        ly to the Scottish trials of this time - and here-
                        after -  owed its  original impulse to  him; every
                        groan  of the  tortured  wretches driven  to their
                        fearful doom, and every tear of the survivors left
                        blighted and desolate to drag out their weary days
                        in  mingled grief  and terror,  lie on  his memory
                        with shame and  condemnation ineffaceable for  all
                        time."

                                                                                1642          


              But it was under Charles II that perhaps the most famous -  and endur-
              ing  - of  Scottish  witches was  tried,  and most  probably  executed
              (although records  of her punishment have not survived). Isobel Gowdie
              of Auldearne,  on four separate  occasions during 1662  testified that
              she  was a witch, and gave what  Russell Hope Robbins describes as: "a
              resum. of popular beliefs about witchcraft in Scotland.". He says that
              Gowdie "appeared clearly demented", but that "it is plain she believed
              what she confessed, no matter how impossible...".

              From Gowdie are  derived some of the concepts of  today's Wicca, incl-
              uding the idea of a coven, comprised of 13 people.  Gowdie said that a
              coven was  ruled by a  "Man in Black",  often called "Black  John". He
              would often beat the witches severely, and it seemed their main  tasks
              were  to raise storms, change  themselves into animals,  and shoot elf
              arrows  to injure or kill people. Coming  as she does right at the end
              of  the witchcraft persecutions, it is difficult to establish how much
              of Gowdie's confession  is based upon real, traditional folk practices
              of  Auldearne, and  how  much she  is  simply repeating  the  standard
              accusations against witches.   The Coven of 13 is  probably the single
              aspect of her confessions  which does not appear elsewhere  in records
              of witchcraft trials, and my own feelings are that she was probably as
              genuine a witch as was ever taken and tried.

              We have already commented how terrifying it is to consider the  impact
              that a single person  can have upon  the lives of  so many people.  We
              have looked  at a number of  these - King James,  Kramer and Sprenger,
              Matthew Hopkins, Conrad of  Marburg - and their latter  day successors
              are no  less  dangerous. Let  us  consider some  of the  20th  century
              persecutors.  We  have  already  mentioned Adolf  Hitler;  what  about
              Stalin?  his great purge in  the period following  1936 saw charges of
              treason, espionage and terrorism brought against anyone who showed the
              least inclination to oppose him. Using techniques which would not have
              been  out of  place during  the great  witch hunts,  Stalin's henchmen
              enforced "confessions", and effectively exterminated any threat to his
              political power.

              We could look  too at  McCarthy, whose fame  for persecution was  such
              that his name is now used to describe "the use  of unsupported accusa-
              tions  for any purpose".  It is no  accident that  his activities were
              referred to as a "witch hunt", nor that Arthur Miller's play about the
              Salem  witch trials, "The Crucible",  was more a  comment about McCar-
              thyism than a comment about 17th century American life.

              In 20th century Australia we are heirs to a European history, which
              maintains  that witches  are  servants of  the  devil, and  should  be
              prosecuted for their crimes against humanity. In some States these
              laws actually remain upon the Statute Books; in others, the legal
              machinery has been removed, but often public opinion hovers around the
              middle ages, believing that the only good witch is a dead witch.

              Our latter-day inquisitors play upon these fears, in much the same
              way as  Matthew Hopkins played upon the fears of the people during the
              Civil War. Christian Fundamentalists have no hesitation in using every
              dirty trick in the book to  ensure that public opinion remains opposed
              to witchcraft. If this means  that some of them  have to stand up  and
              say: "Yes, I  was a witch:  I sacrificed my  babies to the  devil, and
              copulated with  a goat; I took  part in drunken orgies,  and drank the
              blood of the sacrifice"; but  then I found Jesus, and was  born again,

                                                                                1643          

              and now I'm  a really nice person; well so be  it. Some of them are so
              psychiatrically unbalanced they may even believe it themselves.

              Listen to a  sample of the claims made by  Audrey Harper, who achieved
              notoriety in Britain as an  ex-HPS of a Witches' Coven.   This extract
              is from an article by Aries, which appeared in Web of Wyrd #5:

                        Sent to  a Dr  Barnado's home by  her mother,  she
                        grew up  with  deprivation and  social stigma.  In
                        time she becomes a WRAF, falls in love, gets preg-
                        nant, boyfriend dies, she turns to booze, gives up
                        her baby  and becomes homeless. Wandering  to Pic-
                        cadilly Circus she meets some Flower Children with
                        the  killer weed,  and  her descent  into Hell  is
                        assured. By day she gets stoned and eats junk
                        food; by night she  sleeps in squats and doorways.
                        Along  comes Molly; the whore with a heart of gold
                        who teaches  Audrey the art  of streetwalking. She
                        flirts with shoplifting, gets into pills, and then
                        gets talent spotted and  invited to a Chelsea par-
                        ty,  where  wealth, power  and tasteful  decor are
                        dangled as bait. At  the next party she is  hooked
                        by the  "group", which meets "every  month in Vir-
                        ginia Water". She agrees to go to the next meeting
                        which is to be held at Hallowe'en.

                        Inside the  dark Temple  lit by black  candles and
                        full of "A heady,  sickly sweet smell from burning
                        incense", she  is  "initiated" by  the  "warlock",
                        whose "face was deathly pale and skeletal... his
                        eyes ...  were dark and sunken"  and whose "breath
                        and body seemed to exude a strange smell, a little
                        like  stale alcohol."  She signs  herself over  to
                        Satan with her own blood on a parchment scroll,
                        whereupon a baby is  produced, its throat cut, and
                        the blood  drank.  Following this  she gets dumped
                        on the  "altar" and  screwed as the  "sacrifice of
                        the White Virgin". The meeting finishes with a
                        little  ritual cursing  and  she's left  to wander
                        "home" in the dark.

                        Her life  falls into a steady  routine of meetings
                        in Virginia  Water, getting  screwed by the  "war-
                        lock", drug  abuse,  petty crime,  and  recruiting
                        runaways for parties, where  the drinks are spiked
                        -"probably with  LSD" - and  candles injected with
                        heroin  release "stupefying  fumes into  the air";
                        the  object being  sex kicks and  pornography. She
                        falls pregnant again, gets committed to a psychia-
                        tric hospital, has the baby, and gives it away
                        convinced that the "warlock" would sacrifice it.
                        Things then become a  confusion of Church desecra-
                        tion,  drug  addiction, ritual  abuse, psychiatric
                        hospital, and  falling in with Christian  folk who
                        try vainly to save her soul. For rather vague
                        reasons the  "coven" decide  to drop her  from the
                        team, and she dedicates herself to a true junkie's
                        lifestyle with a steady round of overdosing, jaun-
                        dice, and detoxification units. The "warlock"

                                                                      1644                    

                        drops by  to threaten her,  and she makes  her way
                        north  via some psychiatric  hospitals to a Chris-
                        tian Rehabilitation farm. She  gets married, has a
                        child which she keeps, and becomes a regular chur-
                        chgoer.  But  beneath  the  surface  are recurring
                        nightmares,  insane  anger and  murderous feelings
                        towards her brethren.  At the Emmanual Pentecostal
                        Church  in Stourport  she asks  the  Minister, Roy
                        Davies, for help. He prays, and God tells him that
                        she was involved with  witchcraft. An exorcism has
                        her born again, cleansed of her sin. She gets bap-
                        tised and has no  more nightmares, becoming a gen-
                        erally nicer person.  She becomes the  "occult ex-
                        pert" of the  Reachout Trust  and Evangelical  Al-
                        liance, and makes a career out  of telling an edi-
                        ted version of her tale.

                        Geoffrey Dickens  MP persuades her to  tell all on
                        live TV; "Audrey, to your knowledge is child sacr-
                        ifice still going on?" To this she replies, "To my
                        knowledge, yes." After  this the whole thing  ram-
                        bles into an untidy conclusion of self-congratula-
                        tion, self-promotion,  and self-justification; and
                        for a grand finale pulls out  a list of horrendous
                        child abuse, which is shamelessly exploited in
                        typically  journalistic fashion, and  by the usual
                        fallacious  arguments which  links it  to anything
                        "occult"; help-lines, astro  predictions in  news-
                        papers, and even New Age festivals.

              And so we are left with a horrifying vision of hordes of Satanists
              swarming the country, buggering  kids, sacrificing babies, and feeding
              their own faeces to the flock."

              Whilst all this  seems incredible to any rational  person, unfortunat-
              ely, in the age old tradition, it confirms the worst fears of the  man
              and woman in the street, and so they swallow  it whole.  After all, it
              was on telly, so it MUST be true!

              As a direct result of people like Audrey Harper publicising their lies
              and fantasy,  children in England  and Scotland were  forcibly removed
              from their homes, and subjected to the type of questioning that we had
              previously believed had died out at the end of the Middle Ages.

              A consultant  clinical psychologist  scrutinised the  interview trans-
              cripts and audio records of the recent Orkney child abuse case,
              and in her summing  up said: "[the  Social Workers] told the  children
              they knew things had happened  to them and were generally  leading all
              the  way. When  the children  denied things,  the questions  were con-
              tinually put until  the children got hungry and gave  them the answers
              they wanted."

              Who says that torture is no longer legal in the British Isles?  

              The father of four of the children who were taken into care said:
              "At first I thought the allegations were laughable, but I found out
              how serious the police were...". Just to remind you of the words of
              Gilles de Rais some 500 years ago: [the accusations] are frivolous
              and lack credit...".

                                                                                1645          

              One 11 year-old described being asked to  draw a circle of ritualistic
              dancers. He said: "They got me to draw by  saying, 'I am not a drawer.
              Can you draw that?' It was meant to be a ring with children around and
              a  minister in the  middle wearing  a black robe  and a crook  to pull
              children in."

              The boy said  he had been promised  treats such as  a lesson on how  a
              helicopter worked if he co-operated, and was told that he could
              go if he gave one name. How remarkably similar to medieval witch
              trials,  where the victims were  always pressed to  name their accomp-
              lices - for is it not said, "thou canst not be a witch alone?"!

              In 1990,  journalist Rosie  Waterhouse commenting upon  the Manchester
              child  abuse  case said:  "After three  months  of questioning  by the
              NSPCC,  strange  stories began  to come  out  and other  children were
              named. The way the children began telling "Satanic" tales in this case
              is  remarkably similar  to  the way  such  stories first  surfaced  in
              Nottingham. As "The  Independent on Sunday" revealed last week (23/9/-
              90), the  Nottingham children  began talking about  witches, monsters,
              babies  and blood  only after  they had been  encouraged, by  an NSPCC
              social  worker, to  play with toys  which included  witches' costumes,
              monsters, toy babies, and a syringe for extracting blood."

              Believe it or not, the parents of these children had no access to
              them whatsoever. Why? Because our modern, scientifically trained,
              20th century social workers believed that, "[the parents] would try
              to  silence  the children,  using  secret Satanic  symbols  or trigger
              words".

              By  March 1991,  senior Police spokesmen  were publicly  claiming that
              "police have no evidence of ritual or satanic abuse inflicted on
              children anywhere in England or Wales". Scotland has a different
              legal system, which is why it was not included in the statement -
              not because the police have evidence there, for they do not.

              When the Rochdale case finally came to court, after the children
              had been in care (sic!) for about 16 months, the judge delivered a
              damning indictment upon those  who were responsible for it,  and said:
              "the way  the children had  been removed  from their parents  was par-
              ticularly upsetting." He  saw a video of the removal  of one girl from
              her home during a dawn  raid, and commented that, "It is  obvious from
              the  video tape  that the  girl is not  merely frightened  but greatly
              distressed at being removed from home. The sobbing and distraught girl
              can be seen. It is one of my most abiding memories of this case."

              Let us  return briefly to  Salem, where, in 1710,  William Good petit-
              ioned for  damages in respect of  the trial and execution  of his wife
              Sarah, and the imprisonment of his daughter, Dorothy, "a child of four
              or five  years old, [who] being  chained in the dungeon  was so hardly
              used  and terrified  that she  hath ever  since been  very chargeable,
              having little or no reason to govern herself.".

                                                                                1646          


              Today's Christian Fundamentalist, like his vicious  and self-righteous
              predecessors, will use anything in his or her power-including innocent
              children -  to destroy the evils of Paganism and the occult. Sometimes
              I wonder if we are becoming paranoid, or the subjects of a persecution
              complex, but  in writing this lecture  it was brought home  to me more
              strongly than ever before: the witch trials of the Middle Ages are not
              a bloody stain  on the history  of Christianity; they  are the  source
              from where today's fundamentalists  draw their power, and are  just as
              terrifying  today  as they  were hundreds  of  years ago.  Bigotry and
              persecution have changed in only one respect: 20th century mankind has
              far  more efficient and effective  means of spreading  lies and propa-
              ganda than was available to our ancestors.
              PERSECUTION: ANCIENT AND MODERN

              Appendix A

              The  subject of the  European Witch Trials  has been  written about ad
              infinitum  (and nauseam!),  and there  are a  great many  useful books
              which  the student will find  of interest. There  follows a short bib-
              liography of those to which I referred when writing this lecture.

                   The  basic  theology of  Manichaeism is  that  good and  evil are
              separate  and opposed principles, which have become mixed in the world
              through  the  action of  the evil  principle.  There is  a complicated
              mythology  which describes the creation of the world and the elements,
              and a set of complex correspondences by which the seeker can return to
              a state of salvation. Manichaeism spread across a huge area, including
              the Roman  Empire. However, by the  6th century it had  virtually been
              eradicated  from Spain, France and  Italy, although was  strong in the
              eastern Mediterranean until the 9th century, when it was absorbed into
              the neo-Manichean sects of the Bogomils, Cathars, etc.

              Bogomils:          a religious sect which flourished in the Balkans   
                                between the 10th and 15th centuries. 

                   Their central teaching was  strictly dualistic; that the visible,
              material world was created by the Devil, and that everything within it
              was therefore evil.   They  rejected many of  the trappings of  Chris-
              tianity, and  their condemnation of  anything to  do with the  flesh -
              including eating and drinking! - has rightly earned them the nickname,
              "the greatest puritans of the middle ages".

              Cathars:           a heretical Christian sect that flourished in      
                                western Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries. 

                   They believed that  goodness existed only in the  spiritual world
              created  by God, and  that the material  world, created by  Satan, was
              evil. Their theology bore  a great resemblance to that  of Manichaeism
              and the Bogomils, and they were closely connected with the latter.

              Waldensians:       also known as Valdenses or Vaudois. The sect was

                               r, and a life devoted to prayer.

                   They  were influenced by other  "heretical" sects, and rejected a
              number of  the basic tenets  of the Catholic  faith.  They  were stern
              opponents  to the acquisition of  wealth and power  within the Church,
              and  thus came into direct  opposition to the  Papacy,which thrived on
              both.   They  were fiercely  persecuted, and  by the  end of  the 15th
              century, confined mainly to the French and Italian
              valleys  of the Cottian Alps. During the 16th century, the Waldensians
              were transformed into a Protestant church, but suffered heavy persecu-
              tion throughout the 17th century from the Dukes of Savoy.  This ceased
              only after Oliver  Cromwell intervened personally on their behalf with
              the duke, Charles Emmanuel II. In  the latter part of the 17th century
              the Waldensians returned to their original homeland, and in 1848 the
              Waldensians  were given  civil rights,  and are  today members  of the
              World Presbyterian Alliance.

                          HISTORY OF WICCA IN ENGLAND: 1939 - present day 

              This talk  was given  by Julia Phillips  at the  Wiccan Conference  in
              Canberra, 1991.  It is  mainly about  the early days  of the  Wicca in
              England;  specifically what  we  now call  Gardnerian and  Alexandrian
              traditions. The text remains  "as given", so please remember  when you
              read  it that  it was  never intended  to be  "read", but  "heard" and
              debated.

              Text begins:

              There are three main strands I intend to examine: one, Gardner's claim
              of  traditional  initiation,  and  its  subsequent  development;  two,
              magical  traditions to which Gardner would have had access; and three,
              literary sources.

              As  we look at  these three main  threads, it is important  to bear in
              mind  that Gardner was 55 years old at the time of his claimed initia-
              tion; that  he had  spent many  years in Malaya,  and had  an enormous
              interest in magic, Folklore  and Mythology.  By the  time he published
              High  Magic's Aid, he was 65, and  75 when "The Meaning of Witchcraft"
              appeared. He died in 1964, at the age of 80.

              Gardner was born in 1884,  and spent most of his working adult life in
              Malaya. He  retired, and  returned to  the UK in  1936. He  joined the
              Folklore  Society,  and in  June 1938,  also  joined the  newly opened
              Rosicrucian  Theatre at  Christchurch  where it  is  said he  met  Old
              Dorothy Clutterbuck.

              I chose 1939 as my arbitrary starting point as  that was the year that
              Gerald  Gardner claims he was initiated by Old Dorothy into a practis-
              ing coven  of the  Old Religion, that  met in the  New Forest  area of
              Britain. In his own words,

              "I realised that I had stumbled upon something interesting;  but I was
              half-initiated before the  word, "Wica" which they used  hit me like a
              thunderbolt, and I  knew where I was, and that  the Old Religion still
              existed. And so I found myself in the Circle, and there took the usual
              oath of  secrecy, which bound me  not to reveal certain  things." This
              quote is taken from The Meaning of Witchcraft,  which was published in
              1959.

              It is interesting that in this  quote, Gardner spells Wicca with  only
              one  "c"; in the earlier  "Witchcraft Today" (1954)  and "High Magic's
              Aid"  (1949), the word Wicca is not  even used. His own derivation for
              the word, given in "The Meaning of Witchcraft", is as follows:

              "As they  (the Dane and Saxon  invaders of England) had  no witches of
              their own they had no special name for them; however, they made one up
              from "wig" an idol,  and "laer", learning, "wiglaer" which  they shor-
              tened into "Wicca".

              "It  is a curious fact  that when the  witches became English-speaking
              they adopted their Saxon name, "Wica"."

                                                                                1657          


              In  "An ABC of Witchcraft Past  and Present", Doreen Valiente does not
              have  an entry for Wicca, but when discussing Witchcraft, does mention
              the Saxon derivation from the word Wicca or Wicce. In the more recent-
              ly  published The  Rebirth Of  Witchcraft, however,  she rejects  this
              Saxon  theory in favour of  Prof. Russell's derivation  from the Indo-
              European root "Weik", which relates to things connected with magic and
              religion.  

              Doreen  Valiente  strongly  supports Gardner's  claim  of  traditional
              initiation,  and published the  results of  her successful  attempt to
              prove  the existence  of Dorothy  Clutterbuck in  an appendix  to "The
              Witches' Way" by Janet and Stewart Farrar. It is a marvellous piece of
              investigation, but  proving that Old  Dorothy existed does  nothing to
              support Gardner's claims that she initiated him.

              In  his book, "Ritual Magic  in England", occultist  Francis King does
              offer some anecdotal evidence in support of Gardner's claims. However,
              it is  only fair  to point  out that  in the  same book,  he virtually
              accuses  Moina Mathers of murder,  based upon a  misunderstanding of a
              story told by Dion Fortune! With that caveat, I'll recount the tale in
              full:

              King  relates that in 1953, he became acquainted with Louis Wilkinson,
              who  wrote under  the pen-name  of Louis  Marlow, and  had contributed
              essays to Crowley's Equinox. He later became one of Crowley's literary
              executors. King  says that  in conversation,  Wilkinson told him  that
              Crowley  had  claimed to  have been  offered  initiation into  a witch
              coven, but that he refused, as he didn't want to be bossed around by a
              bunch of women. (This story is well-known, and could have been picked
              up anywhere.)

              Wilkinson  then  proceeded to  tell King  that  he had  himself become
              friendly with members of a coven operating in the New Forest area, and
              he  thought that whilst it was  possible that they derived their exis-
              tence from Murray's "Witch Cult in Western Europe", he felt that  they
              were rather older.  

              King  draws the obvious conclusion;  that these witches  were the very
              same as those who initiated Gardner. King claims that the conversation
              with  Wilkinson took place in 1953, although "Ritual Magic in England"
              was  not published - or  presumably written -  until 1970. However, on
              September 27 1952, "Illustrated" magazine published a feature by Allen
              Andrews, which included details  of a working by, "the  Southern Coven
              of British Witches", where 17 men and women met in the New Forest
              to  repel an  invasion  by Hitler.  Wilkinson  had told  King of  this
              working  during their conversation,  which King  believes to  be proof
              that  such a  coven existed;  there are  some  differences in  the two
              stories, and so it is possible that two sources are reporting the same
              event,  but  as Wilkinson's  conversation  with  King came  after  the
              magazine article, we shall never know.

              In the recently  published "Crafting  the Art of  Magic", Aidan  Kelly
              uses this  same source to "prove" (and I use  the word advisedly - the
              book "proves" nothing") that Gardner, Dorothy, et al created Wicca one
              night following a social get together!  Of one thing we can be certain
              though: whatever its origin, modern Wicca derives from Gardner.  There
              may  of course be other  traditional, hereditary witches,  but even if
              they are genuine, then it  is unlikely that they would have  been able
              to "go public" had it not been for Gardner.

                                                                                1658          


              There have been many  claims of "hereditary" origin (other  than Gard-
              ner's  own!) One of the most famous post-Gardner claimants to "heredi-
              tary" status  was actress Ruth Wynn-Owen, who fooled many people for a
              very  long time before being exposed. Roy  Bowers, who used the pseud-
              onym  Robert  Cochrane, was  another:  Doreen  Valiente describes  her
              association  with him in "The Rebirth of Witchcraft", and The Roebuck,
              which is still  active in the  USA today, derives directly  from Coch-
              rane, via Joe Wilson.  "Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed" by  Evan John
              Jones with Doreen Valiente describes a tradition derived from Robert
              Cochrane.  Alex Sanders, of  course is another  who claimed hereditary
              lineage,  and like Cochrane, deserves  his own place  in this history,
              and we'll get to both of them later.

              Many people have been suspicious of Gardner's claims, and have accused
              him of making the  whole thing up. They  suggest that the Wicca is  no
              more than  the fantasy of an  old man coloured by  a romantic imagina-
              tion. One particularly  virulent attack upon Gardner came from Charles
              Cardell, writing under the pseudonym of Rex Nemorensis.

              One of Gardner's initiates who is still active in the  Wicca today has
              an interesting tale to tell about Cardell, whom he knew:

              "Cardell claimed  to be a  Witch, but  from a  different tradition  to
              Gardner's.  Cardell was  a  psychopathic rat,  with malevolent  intent
              toward all  and sundry. He managed  to get a woman  called Olive Green
              (Florannis) into Gardner's coven, and told her to copy out the Book of
              Shadows so  that Cardell could  publish it,  and destroy Gardner.   He
              also contacted  a London paper, and told them when and where the coven
              meetings were held, and of course the paper got quite a scoop. Cardell
              led people in the coven to believe that it was Doreen Valiente who had
              informed on them.

              Doreen had just  left Gardner in a bit of a huff after a disagreement;
              another coven member, Ned Grove,  left with her.  Anyway, the  day the
              paper printed the  exposure, Cardell sent  Gardner a telegram  saying,
              "Remember  Ameth tonight". (Ameth was  Doreen's Craft name,  and as it
              has now been published, I see no reason not to use it here)."

              My  informant also said that  Olive Green was  associated with Michael
              Houghton, owner of  Atlantis book shop  in Museum Street, who  was the
              publisher  of  High Magic's  Aid. Through  this association,  she also
              encountered  Kenneth Grant of the OTO,  although their association was
              not friendly.

              Cecil Williamson, the original  owner of the witchcraft museum  on the
              Isle of Man, and present owner of the Witchcraft Museum in  Boscastle,
              has also published a number of articles where he states quite categor-
              ically that Gardner was  an utter fraud; but, he offers only anecdotes
              to support these allegations.

              Although Gardner  claimed his initiation  occurred in  1939, we  don't
              really hear anything about him until 1949, when "High Magic's Aid" was
              published by Michael Houghton.

                                                                                1659          


              This book has very  strong Solomonic leanings, but like  Gardner's own
              religious  beliefs, combined the more natural forms of magic with high
              ceremonial. In his introduction  to the book, Gardner says  that: "The
              Magical rituals are authentic, party from the Key of Solomon (MacGreg-
              or Mathers' translation)  and partly  from magical MSS  in my  posses-
              sion)." Gardner did indeed have a large collection of MSS, which
              passed with  the rest of  his goods  to Ripleys in  Toronto after  his
              death.

              Scire (pseudonym) was  the name Gardner took as a  member of Crowley's
              branch of the OTO; although it is generally agreed that his membership
              was  purely  nominal, he  was certainly  in  contact with  people like
              Kenneth  Grant and  Madeline Montalban  (founder of  the Order  of the
              Morning Star).

              Gardner was given  his OTO degree and Charter by  Aleister Crowley, to
              whom he was introduced in 1946 by Arnold Crowther.  As Crowley died in
              1947, their association was not long-lived, but Crowther confirms that
              the two men enjoyed each other's company.

              So, after that brief introduction  we can have a look at  the first of
              the strands I mentioned.

              In 1888, the  Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn  was born, beginning a
              renaissance  of interest  in  the occult  that  has continued  to  the
              present day. It is impossible to overstate the importance of the GD to
              modern occultists; not only in its  rituals, but also in its personal-
              ities; and of course, through making available a  large body of occult
              lore  that would otherwise have remained unknown, or hidden in obscur-
              ity.

              I  will be  looking at this  body of  occult lore  with other literary
              influences  later, and will here  concentrate on the  rituals and per-
              sonalities that have influenced Wicca.

              We cannot  look at the  GD in isolation  from its  own origins. It  is
              descended from a myriad  of esoteric traditions including Rosicrucian-
              ism, Theosophy, and Freemasonry. The latter  in its own right, as well
              as via  the  SRIA -  a scholarly  and ceremonial  association open  to
              Master Masons only.

              Whether  the German Lodge or  Fraulein Sprengel actually  existed is a
              matter still  under debate; but either  in fact or in  spirit, this is
              the source for the  "Cypher Manuscripts" which were used to  found the
              Isis-Urania Lodge in 1888.

              As I'm sure everyone  knows, Isis-Urania was founded by  Dr Wynn-West-
              cott,  Dr  Woodman, and  MacGregor Mathers.  Not  only were  all three
              Master  Masons; Wynn-Westcott  and Mathers  were also  members of  the
              Theosophical  Society. The most important thing though is the fact the
              these three men were a ruling triumvirate that managed the  affairs of
              the SRIA. This is  important, for the SRIA included  Hargrave Jennings
              in its membership, and Jennings is reputed to have been involved with
              a  Pagan group at the end of  the 19th century, which drew its inspir-
              ation from Apuleius - The Golden Ass.

                                                                                1660          


              But back to the GD - whether the Cypher  Manuscripts actually existed,
              or  Wynn-Westcott manufactured  them  is now  irrelevant; Mathers  was
              commissioned to write-up the  rituals into a workable shape,  and thus
              the Golden Dawn was born.  

              Members  of the Isis-Urania Lodge at various times also included Allan
              Bennett, Moina  Mathers, Aleister Crowley, Florence  Farr, Maud Gonne,
              Annie Horniman, Arthur  Machen, "Fiona Macleod",  Arthur Waite and  WB
              Yeats.  Also associated  were Lady  Gregory, and  G W Russell,  or AE,
              whose "The Candle of Vision" was  included in the bibliography of "The
              Meaning of Witchcraft". The literary and Celtic influences within  the
              GD were immense.

              From  the  Isis-Urania  Lodge sprang  all  the  others, including  the
              so-called Dissident  Orders derived through  Crowley. It is  this line
              that some  commentators trace to modern  Wicca, so it is  the one upon
              which we will concentrate.

              Aleister  Crowley  was  initiated  into the  Isis-Urania  Lodge  on 18
              November  1898. As  you most probably  know, Crowley  later quarrelled
              with MacGregor Mathers, and in 1903 began to create his own Order, the
              Argenteum  Astrum, or Silver Star. In 1912, Crowley was initiated into
              the OTO, and in 1921, succeeded Theodor Reuss as its Chief.

              According to  Arnold Crowther's account, it was in 1946, a year before
              Crowley's  death, that  Crowley gave  Gardner an  OTO  Charter. Ithell
              Colquhoun says only that it occurred  in the 1940s, and further states
              that  Gardner introduced material from the OTO, and less directly from
              the GD, into "...the lore of his covens".

              As  Doreen Valiente also admits, "Indeed, the influence of Crowley was
              very  apparent throughout  the (Wiccan)  rituals.". This,  Gardner ex-
              plained to her, was because the rituals he received from Old Dorothy's
              coven were  very fragmentary, and  in order to make  them workable, he
              had to supplement them with other material.

              To  give an example of some  of the lines by  Crowley which are rather
              familiar to modern Wiccans:

              I  give unimaginable  joys on  earth; certainty,  not faith,  while in
              life,  upon death; peace unutterable,  rest, ecstasy; nor  do I demand
              aught in sacrifice.

              I am Life, and the giver of Life, yet therefore is the knowledge of me
              the knowledge of death.

              And of course, the Gnostic Mass has been immensely influential.

              Not only poetry, but also magical practices in Wicca are often derived
              from GD sources. For example:

              the way  of casting  the circle:  that  is, the  visualisation of  the
              circle, and the  pentagrams at the quarters,  are both based  upon the
              standard GD Pentagram Ritual;

                                                                                1661          


              both the  concept and word  "Watchtowers" are of course  from the Eno-
              chian system  of Magic, passed to  Wicca via the GD  (although I would
              like  to make  it very  clear  that their  use within  Wicca bears  no
              relation  to the use  within Enochia -  the only similarity  is in the
              name);

              the  Elements and  colours generally  attributed  to the  Quarters are
              those of the GD; 

              the  weapons and their attributions  are a combination  of GD, Crowley
              and Key of Solomon.

              In "Witchcraft Today",  Gardner says, "The people  who certainly would
              have had the knowledge and  ability to invent (the Wiccan  rites) were
              the people who formed the Order of the Golden Dawn about seventy years
              ago...".

              The GD is  not the only influence upon Gardner;  Freemasonry has had a
              tremendous  impact upon the Wicca. Not only were the three founders of
              Isis-Urania  Temple Masons, so too were Crowley and Waite; Gardner and
              at least  one member of the  first coven (Daffo) were  both Co-Masons.
              Gardner was also  a friend of JSM Ward, who had  published a number of
              books about Masonry.

              Doreen describes Ward as a "leading Mason", but Francis King says only
              that Ward was, "a bogus Bishop... who had written some  quite good but
              far-fetched books on masonry, and who ran a peculiar religious-cum-oc-
              cult  community called The  Abbey of Christ the  King..."  Whether the
              books were far-fetched  or not, we  can assume that  some of the  many
              similarities  between Wicca and Masonry are in some ways due to Ward's
              influence.

              Some of these include:

              The Three Degrees
              The Craft
              So Mote It Be
              The Challenge
              Properly Prepared
              The 1st Degree Oath (in part)
              Presentation of the Working Tools at 1st degree

              and so on.

              It seems to me quite clear that even if Gardner received a traditional
              set  of  rituals from  his coven,  they  must have  been exceptionally
              sparse,  as the  concepts that  we know  of  as Wicca  today certainly
              derive from ceremonial magic  and Freemasonry to a very  great extent.
              Indeed, Gardner always claimed that they were sparse.

              It could  be argued  that all  derive from a  common source.  That the
              appearance  of a phrase, or technique in one tradition does not autom-
              atically  suggest that its appearance elsewhere means that the one was
              taken  from the  other. However,  Gardner admits  his sources  in many
              cases, and Doreen confirms them  in others, so I  think it is safe  to
              presume  that the rituals and  philosophy used by  Wicca descends from
              the traditions of Freemasonry and Ceremonial magic, rather than from a
              single  common source.  However,  as Hudson  Frew  points out  in  his
              commentary upon Aidan  Kelly's book, the  phenomena of the  techniques

                                                                                1662          

              and practices  of ceremonial  magic influencing  folk magic  and trad-
              itions is widely recognised by anthropologists, and certainly does not
              indicate plagiarism.  And of course there are  many traditional witch-
              craft aspects in the Wicca.

              We have looked at the development of the magical orders which resulted
              from  the British occult  revival of the 19th  and 20th centuries, and
              now we can see where this  ties in with Wicca, and Gardner's claim  of
              traditional initiation.

              I have here a "family  tree" of the main branches of British Wicca. It
              is by no means exhaustive, and is intended to provide  an outline, not
              a definitive history! I have included my own coven  lines and develop-
              ment as an  indication of the kind of  "cross-over" of tradition which
              often occurs,  not to suggest that  these are the  only active groups!
              Also,  it would  not be  ethical for  me to  include details  of other
              covens.

              We have  two possible  "hereditary" sources  to the  Gardnerian Craft:
              one, the Horsa Coven of Old Dorothy, and two, the Cumbrian Group which
              Rae  Bone claims to have  been initiated into  before meeting Gardner.
              (NB: Doreen Valiente  says that the Horsa Coven is  not connected with
              Old Dorothy, but is  another group entirely.) There is  also sometimes
              mention of a St Alban's  group that pre-dates Gardner, but as far as I
              know, this is mistaken. The St Albans group was Gardner's own group,
              which as far as research confirms, did not pre-date him.

              To return  to Rae Bone: she was one of  Gardner's HPSs, and her "line"
              has been immensely important to the modern Wicca;  she was featured in
              the  magazine series,  "Man Myth and  Magic" if  anyone has  a copy of
              that.

              In her heyday  she ran two  covens: one in  Cumbria, and one in  South
              London. Rae is  still alive, and lives  in Cumbria, although her  last
              coven  moved  to New  Zealand many  years ago,  and  she is  no longer
              active. No-one has ever been able to trace the coven in New Zealand.

              At  this point, I will just mention  George Pickingill, although he is
              not shown on the tree, as I think it extremely dubious that he had any
              connection with Gardner, or any other modern Wiccan.

              Pickingill died  in 1909, whilst  Gardner was still  in Malaya.   Eric
              Maple  is largely  responsible  for the  beginnings of  the Pickingill
              myth,  which  were expanded  by Bill  Liddell  (Lugh) writing  in "The
              Wiccan" and "The Cauldron" throughout the 1970s. Mike Howard still has
              some of  Liddell's material which  he has never published,  and I have
              yet to  meet anyone  within the British  Craft who  gives credence  to
              Liddell's claims.

              In the  book, "The Dark  World of  Witches", published in  1962, Maple
              tells of a number of village wise  women and cunning men, one of  whom
              is George Pickingill.  There is a  photograph included of  an old  man
              with a stick, holding a hat, which Maple describes as Pickingill. This
              photograph has subsequently been re-used many times in  books about
              witchcraft and Wicca.

                                                                                1663          


              Issue number 31  of "Insight"  Magazine, dated July  1984, contains  a
              very interesting letter from John Pope:

              "The photograph purporting to  be Old George Pickingill  is in fact  a
              photo of Alf Cavill, a station porter at Ellstree, taken  in the early
              1960s.  Alf is  now dead, but  he was  no witch, and  laughed over the
              photograph when he saw it."

              A  very respected  Craft authority  has told  me that he  believes the
              photo, which  is in his possession,  to be of Pickingill,  but like so
              much  to do with Craft history, there  is no definitive answer to this
              one.

              Many claims were  made by  Liddell; some  obviously from  cloud-cuckoo
              land, others  which could,  by a  stretch of  the imagination, be  ac-
              cepted.  The very  idea of  Pickingill,  an illiterate  farm labourer,
              co-ordinating and supervising nine covens across the breadth of the UK
              is staggering. To accept - as Liddell avers - that he had the likes of
              Alan Bennett and Aleister  Crowley as his pupils bends  credulity even
              further.

              The infamous  photograph which  Liddell claims shows  Crowley, Bennett
              and  Pickingill  together  has conveniently  disappeared,  and  no-one
              admits to ever having seen it. Like most of Liddell's claims,  nothing
              has ever been  substantiated, and  when pushed, he  retreats into  the
              time  honoured favourite  of, "I  can't reveal  that -  you're  not an
              initiate"!

              But to  return to the family  tree: the names of  Doreen Valiente, Pat
              and Arnold Crowther, Lois Bourne (Hemmings), Jack Bracelin and Monique
              Wilson will probably be the most familiar to you.

              Jack  Bracelin is the author of  Gardner's biography, "Gerald Gardner,
              Witch",  (published 1960) now  out of print,  although still available
              2nd  hand, and  in libraries.  (In  Crafting the  Art of  Magic, Kelly
              claims that  this book was actually written by Idries Shah, and simply
              published under  Bracelin's  name. As  with every  other claim,  Kelly
              offers no evidence of this)

              I have seen a copy of Bracelin's Book of Shadows, which it  is claimed
              dates  from 1949, although in  The Rebirth Of  Witchcraft, Doreen says
              that Bracelin was  a "relative newcomer" in the mid-1950s. I have also
              been  told by two different sources that Bracelin helped Gardner write
              "The Laws". In The  Rebirth Of Witchcraft, Doreen states that  she did
              not see The  Laws until the  mid 1950s, when  she and her partner  Ned
              Grove accused Gardner of concocting them in order to re-assert control
              over the coven. As Bracelin was in the Gardner camp during the breakup
              of the group, it seems reasonable that he did in fact help with  their
              composition.  (NB:  Alex Sanders  increased the number  of "The  Laws"
              much  later -  these appeared in  June Johns'  book, "The  King of the
              Witches")

                                                                                1664          


              Although Doreen claims that the reason for the coven  break-up was the
              fact that Gardner and Bracelin were publicity crazy, there was another
              reason, which  was the  instatement  of a  new  lady into  the  coven,
              effectively replacing Doreen as  HPS. This is also the main reason for
              Gerald's  Law which states that the HPS will, "...gracefully retire in
              favour  of a younger  woman, should the  coven so  decide in council."
              Needless to  say, Doreen was not  impressed, and she and  Ned left the
              coven under  very acrimonious  circumstances. It  was quite some  time
              before Doreen had contact with Gardner again, and they never quite
              regained the degree of friendship that had previously existed.

              Monique  and Campbell  Wilson  are infamous,  rather  than famous,  as
              Gardner's heirs  who sold  off his  magical equipment  and possessions
              after his death, to Ripleys in the USA.

              Monique was the last of his  Priestesses, and many Wiccans today still
              spit  when her  name is  mentioned. Pat  Crowther was  rather scathing
              about her recently in an interview, and in The Rebirth  Of Witchcraft,
              although  Doreen tells of the sale of Gardner's magical possessions to
              Ripleys, she doesn't  ever mention the Wilsons by name. In effect, the
              Craft closed ranks against them, and they became outcasts.

              Eventually, in the face of such opposition they had to sell the Museum
              in Castletown, and  they moved  to Torremolinos, where  they bought  a
              cafe. Monique died nine years after selling the Museum. It is rumoured
              that Campbell Wilson  moved to the  USA, and met  with a car  accident
              there:  this is only  hearsay though -  I really do  not know for sure
              what happened to him.

              However, Monique was influential in a way that even she could not have
              imagined, when in 1964 or  5 she initiated Ray Buckland, who  with his
              wife Rosemary (later divorced),  was very influential in  the develop-
              ment of the Wicca in the USA.

              Fortunately,  Richard and  Tamarra James  managed to  buy the  bulk of
              Gardner's collection back from  Ripleys in 1987, for the  princely sum
              of US$40,000, and it is  now back within the Craft, and  available for
              initiates to consult and view.

              D and  C S. are probably completely anonymous, and  if it were not for
              the fact that C initiated Robert  Cochrane (briefly mentioned earlier)
              they would probably stay that way!

              Cochrane's  origins  are obscure,  but I  have been  told that  he was
              initiated into the Gardnerian tradition by C S, and met Doreen Valien-
              te through a mutual acquaintance in 1964. When he met Doreen, however,
              he  claimed to  be a hereditary  witch, from a  different tradition to
              Gardner's,  and as Doreen confirms, was contemptuous of what he called
              "Gardnerian" witches.   Indeed,  Doreen believes  he coined  the term,
              "Gardnerian".

              Doreen said she was completely  taken in by Cochrane and for  a while,
              worked with  him and  the "Clan  of Tubal-Cain"  as  he described  his
              tradition,  which was  also known  as "The  Royal Windsor  Cuveen", or
              1734.

              The  figures "1734" have an interesting history. Doreen gives a rather
              strange  account of them in  The Rebirth Of  Witchcraft, which contra-

                                                                                1665          

              dicts what Cochrane himself describes in a letter to Joe Wilson, dated
              "12th Night 1966", where he says,

              "...the  order of  1734 is not  a date of  an event but  a grouping of
              numerals that mean something to a witch.

              "One that becomes  seven states of wisdom - the  Goddess of the Cauld-
              ron. Three  that are the Queens of the Elements - fire belonging alone
              to Man, and the Blacksmith God. Four that are Queens of the Wind Gods.

              "The Jewish orthodoxy  believe that  whomever knows the  Holy and  Un-
              speakable name of God has absolute power over the world  of form. Very
              briefly,  the name of God spoken  as Tetragrammaton ... breaks down in
              Hebrew  to the letters  YHVH, or the  Adam Kadmon (The  Heavenly Man).
              Adam Kadmon is a composite of all Archangels - in other words a poetic
              statement of the names of the Elements.

              "So  what the Jew  and the  Witch believe alike,  is that  the man who
              discovers the secret of the Elements controls the physical world. 1734
              is the witch way of saying YHVH." (Cochrane, 1966)

              Although  Doreen says that Cochrane's group was small, it still proved
              to be remarkably influential.  As well as Cochrane and his  wife (whom
              Doreen refers to as "Jean") and Doreen herself, there  were others who
              are  well-known today, and  a man called  Ronald White, who  very much
              wanted to  bring about a new  age in England, with the  return of King
              Arthur.

              In The Rebirth Of Witchcraft, Doreen elaborates upon the circumstances
              surrounding the death of Cochrane: the bald facts are that  he died at
              the Summer Solstice of  1966 of an overdose. Craft  tradition believes
              that he became in fact, and of  his own choice, the male ritual sacri-
              fice which is sometimes symbolically enacted at the height of Summer.

              The Royal Windsor  Cuveen disbanded  after Cochrane died,  only to  be
              re-born from  the ashes at  Samhain that year  under a new  name - The
              Regency. All  of its early members were from the Royal Windsor Cuveen,
              and they were under the leadership of Ronald White. The Regency proved
              to be  of great importance to  the development of the  Wicca, although
              its  existence was kept  a fairly close secret,  and even today, there
              are relatively few people who have ever heard of it.

              Meetings were held in North London,  at a place called Queens Wood. As
              well as Ron White  and Doreen Valiente, members included  "John Math",
              founder  of the Witchcraft Research Association in 1964, and editor of
              Pentagram magazine, and the founder of the Pagan Movement, Tony Kelly.
              At  its height, there  were frequently more  than 40 in  attendance at
              rites, which tended to be of the dramatic, pagan kind rather than the
              ceremonial  associated with  high ritual  magic. The  Regency operated
              fairly consistently for over twelve years, finally disbanding in 1978.
              The Membership roll reads like a who's who of the  British Wicca! Some
              of the rites  have been incorporated  into modern Wiccan rituals  - in
              fact, one  was used at  the Pan European  Wiccan Conference 1991  with
              very great success.

              Moving back over to Rae Bone's line, there are a number of influential
              people  here,  mainly through  her  initiates, Madge  and  Arthur, who
              probably take the award for the most prolific pair in Wiccandom!  Rae,
              although  initiated by Gardner, does of course also claim a hereditary
              status in her own right.

                                                                                1666          

              Madge and Arthur's initiates include:

              John and Jean Score

              John Score  was the partner  of Michael Houghton  (mentioned earlier),
              and the founder of the Pagan Federation, which is very active today.

              Houghton died  under very  mysterious circumstances, which  is briefly
              mentioned  in  "The Sword  of Wisdom"  by  Ithell Colquhoun.  My Craft
              source told me that this was  actually a ritual that went badly wrong,
              and Houghton ended up on the wrong end of some fairly potent energies.

              There  is an  interesting anecdote  about Houghton  in The  Rebirth Of
              Withcraft, which is taken  from "Nightside of Eden" by  Kenneth Grant,
              and  agrees in some  respect to a  similar story that  I was told some
              years ago. Doreen suggests in The Rebirth Of Witchcraft that the story
              may relate to a magical working  involving Kenneth Grant and his wife,
              Gardner, Dolores  North (Madeline  Montalban), and an  un-named witch,
              who was probably Olive Green.

              They were all to perform a  ritual together, supposedly to contact  an
              extra-terrestrial being. The material  basis for the rite, which  took
              place in 1949, was a drawing by AO Spare.

              Apparently soon after the rite commenced, a nearby bookseller (Michael
              Houghton)  turned  up and  interrupted  proceedings.  On hearing  that
              Kenneth Grant was within,  he declined to enter, and wandered off. The
              rite was disrupted, and the story goes that everyone just went home.

              Kenneth Grant claims  that as  a result of  disturbing their  working,
              Houghton's  marriage broke  up, and  that Houghton died  in mysterious
              circumstances. In fact, the Houghton divorce was a cause celebre, with
              her suing  him for cruelty because  he boasted of being  a Sagittarian
              while sneering at her because she was only a dingy old Capricorn!

              The interrupted ritual  could well  have taken place.  Madeline had  a
              flat  near to  Atlantis (Houghton's  shop), and  would certainly  have
              known  both Grant and  Houghton. I know  for a fact  that Madeline was
              acquainted with Gerald, although her opinion of both him and the Wicca
              was  rather poor. One  of Madeline's older  students told  me that she
              thought Gardner rather  a fraud, and  ritually inept. She  also had  a
              very low opinion of Wiccans, and refused to allow her own students to
              participate in Wiccan rites. The reason  for this lies in an  anecdote
              which  Doreen doesn't relate: the  story goes that  Madeline agreed to
              participate in a rite  with Gerald, which turned out to  involve Made-
              line being tied  up and tickled with a feather  duster! The great lady
              was not amused.

              Prudence Jones

              Prudence was for many years the president of the Pagan Federation, and
              editor  of its  newsletter. She  inherited her  role from  John Score,
              after he passed away. With Nigel Pennick, Prudence also runs the Pagan
              Anti-Defamation League (PADL), and is an active astrologer and therap-
              ist. She  has edited a book  on astrology, and with  Caitlin Matthews,
              edited "Voices from  the Circle",  published by Aquarian  Press.   Al-
              though  Prudence took her degree in Philosophy, her main interests lie
              in the areas of the Grail  and troubadour tales, and she has published
              privately  an excellent essay  on the Grail  and Wicca. She  is also a
              very highly respected astrologer, who lectures extensively in Britain.

                                                                                1667          

              Vivianne and Chris Crowley

              Vivianne Crowley,  is author of "Wicca  - The Old Religion  in the New
              Age", and  also secretary of  the Pagan Federation.  She has a  PhD in
              Psychology, and  is perhaps the only  person to have been  a member of
              both a Gardnerian Coven and an Alexandrian one simultaneously!

              Vivianne is very  active at the  moment, and has  initiated people  in
              Germany  (having memorised  the  ritual in  German  - a  language  she
              doesn't speak!), Norway, and - on the astral - Brazil. As a result  of
              her book,  she receives many letters  from people from all  around the
              world, and  organised the  first ever pan-European  Wiccan conference,
              held in Germany 1990. The second conference was held in Britain at the
              June solstice, and the third (1992) in Norway. In 1993, the Conference
              will be in Scotland.

              John and Kathy  (Caitlin) Matthews, are probably well-known  to every-
              one, but  possibly their  Gardnerian initiations  are not such  common
              knowledge.  The story that John  Matthews relates in  "Voices from the
              Circle" is  essentially the one  which he told  the HPS who  initiated
              him.

              Pat and Arnold Crowther

              I have left  Pat and Arnold till last,  as it is from their  line that
              the infamous  Alex Sanders derives! It is no secret anymore that Alex,
              far from being initiated by his grandmother when he was  seven, was in
              fact turned  down by Pat Crowther  in 1961, but was  later accepted by
              one  of her  ex-coven  members, Pat  Kopanski,  and initiated  to  1st
              Degree.

              In "The Rebirth of Witchcraft" Doreen  says that Alex later met  Gard-
              ner, and was allowed to copy from the Book of Shadows; Craft tradition
              is somewhat different!  It has always been  said (even by Alex's  sup-
              porters!) that he pinched what he could from Pat Kopanski before being
              chucked out, and that the main differences between the Alexandrian and
              Gardnerian Books of Shadows occur  where Alex mis-heard, or mis-copied
              something!   There are  certainly significant differences  between the
              two  Books; some parts of  Gardnerian ritual are  quite unknown within
              the Alexandrian  tradition, and the  ritual techniques are  often dif-
              ferent. It is usually very easy to spot whether someone is an Alexand-
              rian, or Gardnerian initiate.

              Alex needed a HPS,  and as we know, chose Maxine Morris  for the role.
              Maxine is a striking Priestess, and made a very good  visual focus for
              the movement which grew in leaps and bounds.

              In  the late  1960s, Alex and  Maxine were prolific  initiators, and a
              number of their initiates have become well known. Some came to Austra-
              lia, and  there are still a number of covens  in the UK today whose HP
              and/or HPS was initiated by Alex or Maxine.

              Alex and Maxine's most famous initiates are almost certainly Janet and
              Stewart  Farrar, who left them in 1971  to form their own coven, first
              in England, then  later, in  Ireland. Through their  books, they  have
              probably had the  most influence  over the direction  that the  modern
              Craft has  taken. Certainly  in  Australia, the  publication of  "What
              Witches  Do" was an absolute  watershed, and with  Janet and Stewart's
              consistent output, their form of Wicca is more likely to become the
              "standard" than any other type.

                                                                                1668          

              Since their early days of  undiluted Alexandrianism, they have drifted
              somewhat towards a more Gardnerian approach, and  today, tell everyone
              that there are  no differences  between the two  traditions. In  fact,
              despite the merging that has  been occurring over the last  few years,
              there  are  very distinct  differences  between  the traditions;  some
              merely external, others  of a very  significant difference of  philos-
              ophy.

              Seldiy Bate  was originally  magically trained by  Madeline Montalban,
              and  then took  an Alexandrian  initiation from  Maxine and  Alex. Her
              husband,  Nigel,  was also  initiated by  Maxine,  and they  have been
              "public" witches for  a number of  years now,  often appearing on  TV,
              radio and in the press. Their background in ritual  magic is expressed
              in the type of coven that they  run; a combination of Wicca and Cerem-
              onial Magic.

              In 1971,  Alex and Maxine went their separate ways. David Goddard is a
              Liberal Catholic Priest, and for  many years, he and Maxine worked  in
              the Liberal Catholic faith, and did not  run a coven of any kind. Then
              in  1984, Maxine gathered together  a group again,  and started pract-
              ising a combination of Wicca, Qabalah and Liberal Catholicism. She and
              David separated in 1987, and since then her coven has been exclusively
              Wiccan. In 1989, she  married one of her initiates, Vincent,  and they
              are still running an active coven in London today.

              Alex's history after the split was a little more sordid, with one girl
              he married, Jill,  filling the  gutter press with  stories about  Alex
              being homosexual, and defrauding her of  all her money to spend on his
              boyfriends. Sally Taylor was  initiated by Maxine and David,  but then
              transferred to Alex.  She was trained by him, and then started her own
              group.

              I'd now like to focus upon the last of the strands which I believe has
              been influential upon the birth and development  of Wicca; that of the
              literary  traditions  and sources  to  which  Gardner  would have  had
              access.  To a  certain extent  these are  contiguous with  the magical
              traditions described  earlier, as  nowhere is  it ever  suggested that
              Gardner  did in fact ever work  in a magical Lodge,  so we must assume
              that  his knowledge came from the written  form of the rites, not from
              the actual practise of them.

              From  reading  Gardner's books,  it  is quite  apparent  that Margaret
              Murray had  a tremendous impact  upon him. Her  book, "The God  of the
              Witches"  was published  in 1933,  and  twelve years  previously, "The
              Witch Cult in Western  Europe" had appeared. "The God of  the Witches"
              has been tremendously influential on a number of people, and certainly
              inspired Gardner.

              In  fact, "Witchcraft Today", published by Gardner in 1954 contained a
              foreword by Margaret Murray. At this time, remember, Murray's work was
              still taken seriously, and she remained the contributor on the subject
              of witchcraft for the Encyclopedia Britannica for a number of years.

                                                                                1669          


              Now  of course  her work  has been  largely discredited,  although she
              remains  a source  of  inspiration,  if  not historical  accuracy.  In
              Gardner's day, the idea of a  continuing worship of the old pagan gods
              would have been a staggering  theory, and in the second article  in my
              series about Murray (published in The Cauldron), I made the point that
              Murray may have had to pretend scientific veracity in order to get her
              work published in  such times. Don't  forget that Dion Fortune  had to
              publish her work privately, as did Gardner with High Magic's Aid.
              Carlo Ginzburg's  excellent book, "Ecstasies", also  supports Murray's
              basic  premise; although of  course he  regrets her  historical decep-
              tions.

              There  were of  course other  sources than  Murray. In  1899, "Aradia:
              Gospel  of  the Witches"  was published.  Most  of Crowley's  work was
              available  during the  pre-  and post-war  years,  as were  the  texts
              written  and translated by  MacGregor Mathers and  Waite. Also readily
              available  were works such  as The Magus, and  of course the classics,
              from which Gardner drew much inspiration.

              Of paramount importance would have been "The White Goddess", by Robert
              Graves,  which is  still  a standard  reference  book on  any  British
              Wiccan's bookshelf. This was published in 1952; three years after High
              Magic's Aid appeared, and  two years before Gardner's  first non-fict-
              ional book  about witchcraft. I would  just like to say  at this point
              that Graves  has taken some very  unfair criticism in  respect of this
              book. The White Goddess was written as a work of  poetry, not history,
              and to criticise it for being historically innaccurate is to miss the
              point. Unfortunately, I agree that some writers have referred to it as
              an "authority", and thus led their readers up the garden path. This is
              not Graves's fault, nor do I believe it was his intention.

              Another book which  has had a profound influence on  many Wiccans, and
              would  undoubtedly  have been  well known  by  Gardner is  "The Golden
              Bough";  although the entire book was written based upon purely secon-
              dary  research, it is an extensive examination of many pagan practices
              from the Ancient World, and  the emphasis of the male  sacrifice could
              certainly have been taken  from here equally as  well as from  Murray.
              Certain of the Gardnerian ritual practices were almost certainly
              derived from The Golden Bough, or from Frazer's own sources.

              In  "Witchcraft  Today"  Gardner mentions  a  number  of authors  when
              speculating where the  Wiccan rites came from. He says that, "The only
              man  I can think  of who  could have invented  the rites  was the late
              Aleister Crowley."

              He continues to say, "The only other man I can think of who
              could have done it is Kipling...". He also mentions that,
              "Hargrave Jennings might have had a hand in them..." and then
              suggests that "Barrat (sic) of The Magus, circa 1800, would
              have had the ability to invent or resurrect the cult."

              It's  possible that these references are something of a damage control
              operation  by Gardner, who, according to Doreen, was not too impressed
              when she kept telling him that  she recognised certain passages in the
              Witch rites! "Witchcraft Today" was published the  year after Doreen's
              initiation, and  perhaps by seeming genuinely interested  in where the
              Rites came from, Gardner thought he might give the appearance of
              innocence of their construction!

                                                                                1670          

              As  mentioned  previously, Gardner  also  had  a large  collection  of
              unpublished  MSS, which he used extensively,  and one has only to read
              his books to realise that he was a very well-read man, with wide-rang-
              ing  interests. Exactly  the sort  of man  who would  be able  to draw
              together a set of rituals if required.  

              The extensive bibliography to "The Meaning of Witchcraft" published in
              1959, demonstrates this rather well. Gardner includes Magick in Theory
              and  Practice and  The Equinox  of the Gods  by Crowley;  The Mystical
              Qabalah  by Dion Fortune; The Goetia; The White Goddess (Graves); Lady
              Charlotte Guest's  translation of The Mabinogion;  English Folklore by
              Christina Hole; The  Kabbalah Unveiled and  the Abramelin by  Mathers;
              both Margaret Murray's books and Godfrey Leland's Gypsy Sorcery, as
              well as a myriad of classic texts, from Plato to Bede!

              Although this bibliography postdates the creation of Gardnerian Wicca,
              it  certainly indicates from where Gardner draws his inspiration from.
              There  are also  several books  listed which  are either  directly, or
              indirectly, concerned with sex magic, Priapic Cults, or Tantra.

              Hargrave Jenning, mentioned  earlier, wrote a  book called "The  Rosi-
              crucians, their  Rites and Mysteries", which Francis King describes as
              a  book, "concerned  almost  exclusively with  phallicism and  phallic
              images - Jennings saw the penis everywhere."

              As I  mentioned earlier, Hargrave Jennings, a member of the SRIA, also
              belonged to a group, described as a coven, which met  in the Cambridge
              area  in the  1870s, and  performed rituals  based upon  the classical
              traditions - specifically, from  The Golden Ass. There is  no evidence
              to support this,  except that there  are often found  references to  a
              "Cambridge  Coven" linked to Jennings'  name.  Many  of the rituals we
              are  familiar  with today  were of  course  later additions  by Doreen
              Valiente, and  these have  been well  documented by  both her  and the
              Farrars, in a  number of books.   Doreen admits that she  deliberately
              cut much of the poetry by Aleister Crowley, and substituted either her
              own work, or poems from other sources, such as the Carmina Gadelica.

              Of course we can never really know the truth about  the origins of the
              Wicca. Gardner  may have  been an  utter fraud;  he may  have actually
              received  a "Traditional" initiation; or,  as a number  of people have
              suggested, he  may have created  the Wicca  as a result  of a  genuine
              religious experience, drawing upon  his extensive literary and magical
              knowledge to create, or help create, the rites and philosophy.

              What I think we can be fairly certain about is that he was  sincere in
              his belief. If there had been no  more to the whole thing than an  old
              man's  fantasy, then the  Wicca would not  have grown to  be the force
              that it is today, and we would not all be sitting  here in Canberra on
              a Saturday morning!

                                                                                1671
