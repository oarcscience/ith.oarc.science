                                    NATURE SPIRIT MAGIC 
                                     By Larry Cornett
           
          INTRODUCTION: 
           
          Each plant, animal, rock, and other entity has a spirit 
          (consciousness resonance matrix).  These spirits can join 
          together, in a hive-mind, as a spirit of an area.  Nature spirits 
          include real biological intelligences, are psychically powerful, 
          and are much less abstract and controllable than the Elementals 
          that many magical people who perform all of their rituals indoors 
          are familiar with.  They can be extremely powerful allies.  It is 
          possible to sense nature spirits, to determine if they are 
          receptive to a ritual planned, and to have them actively 
          participate in magical workings if they are. 
           
           
          SOME EFFECTS OF WORKING WITH NATURE SPIRITS: 
           
          Spectacular physical manifestations can happen when working with 
          nature spirits in the wild.  I have personally seen actual 
          foxfire mark the boundaries of a magic circle at a location that 
          was identified as a receptive power spot and attuned to a 
          planned ritual the day before.  I have seen more than one site 
          attuned for ritual be dry and comfortable, with a round hole in 
          the clouds overhead, on days that were cold and rainy at other 
          nearby locations.  Birds have joined in rituals, flying around 
          the circle when energy was being raised; and insects, birds and 
          animals have joined in chants.  In addition, the wind often 
          responds to invocations.  Generally, these spectacular 
          manifestations happen unexpectedly.   
           
          With or without such manifestations, nature spirits often will 
          channel tremendous amounts of power into the magic being 
          performed.  It is suggested that you do not consciously try for 
          specific manifestations.  Let Nature channel her power into the 
          magic in her own way.  If approached with respect, nature may 
          give you many pleasant surprises. 
           
          Spectacular physical manifestations are not a necessary sign of 
          success.  If you need a spectacular manifestation and nature 
          spirits know this, you will get it.  The best success in magic is 
          on the inner planes and more subtle than such manifestations.  
          This success involves beneficial changes in consciousness that 
          last and helpful chains of synchronicity.  In addition, working 
          with Nature Spirits can also bring a deep sense of partnership 
          with Nature, and bring new levels of attunement. 
           
          To get the best results, perform nature spirit attunement 
          several hours to several days before the main ritual.  The 
          purposes of such attunement are to find suitable power spots and 
          to get the help of friendly nature spirits.  This timing gives 
          Nature time to gather her children and to prepare to actively 
          participate in the main ritual.

                                                                             357


          WHAT TO NOT DO: 
           
          If nature spirits are approached with disrespect by attempting 
          to command them rather than listening to them and inviting them 
          to work with you, nature spirits may flee, rebel, or attack.  I 
          once attended a ritual by some pseudo-Crowleyites who attempted 
          to perform the &quot;Ritual of the Barbarous Names&quot; at a power spot in 
          a forest and then to extend the circle several hundred yards in 
          all directions.   
           
          While the forest in general had loud insect and frog noises, the 
          area at which the ritual took place got quiet immediately when 
          the main ritualist declared that all spirits were subject unto 
          him.  The vibes from nature could best be characterized as &quot;Oh 
          yea, Mother...!&quot;  One participant was quickly possessed by an 
          angry spirit and kept repeating &quot;You killed my children, your 
          children will never live in peace.&quot;  When the priestess stepped 
          out of the boundaries of the original circle, she was attacked by 
          bees; and bees covered the Book of the Law.  Magicians should 
          know better than to attempt to command spirits whose true names 
          they do not know! 
           
           
          CALLING NATURE SPIRITS: 
           
          To make the most out of working magical ritual in the wild, one 
          should find power spots where nature spirits are receptive to the 
          ritual planned and approach the spirits with respect, as equals.  
          In my experience, the most effective power spots for working with 
          the living intelligences of nature are located in wild areas with 
          diverse, active ecologies.   
           
          When entering a wild area to find a site for a ritual, find a 
          place that feels good.  Then do the following, either 
          individually or, if in a group, as a guided meditation: 
           
          o Relax, while standing upright, and focus on your breathing.  
            Breathe deep breaths from the diaphragm.  Breathe together if 
            in a group. 
            - Feel the wind, and let it relax you and awaken your spirit 
              within, as your deep breathing takes you into non-ordinary 
              reality. 
            - Picture, in your mind's eye, a light inside you.  As you 
              breathe, feel the light expand, purify and energize you  - as 
              it expands to fill your aura.   
            - Feel yourself glowing, balanced, purified, and full of power. 
            - Connect with your inner self (your higher self), and feel 
              your intuitive self operating.

                                                                             358

          o Feel yourself as: 
            - The wind, full of life and intelligence, communicating with 
              all round. 
            - The Sunlight, warm, alive, channeling the power to 
              communicate with nature and energizing all around. 
            - Water, emotional, intuitive, refreshing, and connected with 
              nature. 
            - The Earth, and note how your physical body is able to wander 
              while remaining part of Mother Earth. 
           
          o Focus on your spiritual self, and: 
            - Note the light within and feel it as love,  
            - Expand the light and love beyond the immediate aura of your 
              body to the surrounding area - where you will go to find a 
              power spot and contact nature spirits. 
           
          o Telepathically (by thinking while channeling the love and light 
            energy) send out signals to nature spirits to emerge and be 
            aware of your presence.   
            - Say why you have come, and invite them to join in sharing, 
              mutual celebration, and  the work you intend. 
            - Visualize the light and love energy you are channeling 
              extending out and merging with the light from distant places. 
            - Feel the power of the Earth flowing up through your body and 
              feet. 
            - Feel the power from the sky, and channel this power also to 
              further energize the carrier signal of light and love for 
              communicating with nature. 
            - Visualize the light expanding and merging.   
            - Continue to send out telepathic signals. 
           
          o Now go deeper: 
            - Close your eyes, sit on the Earth, and feel your connection 
              while you channel more light and love.   
            - Continue modulating the light and love with your thoughts - 
              inviting receptive spirits to join with you and to make 
              themselves known. 
            - If in a group, someone should start playing a drum at a rate 
              of about one beat per second; and you should listen to the 
              drum and let the drum take you deeper. 
            - Affirm that you are a nature magician, a medicine person, who 
              knows and communicates with nature.  Let this part of 
              yourself emerge to full consciousness.  Let the drum and the 
              connection to your inner self awaken that part of yourself 
              that naturally communicates with other life forms.  Let it 
              awaken your telepathic senses. 
            - Continue sending telepathic signals to nature.   
            - When you feel ready and an inner urge to begin, open your 
              eyes a crack and look around, while continuing to channel 
              love and light and telepathically calling for a response.   
            - You may see light coming from certain areas that are 
              receptive.  You may get other signals, such as a feeling of 
              power or love returning in a certain direction.  Perhaps the 
              type of response to this work will be unexpected; follow your 
              intuition in interpreting it. 




                         Last amended June 11, 1989  --  Page NEXTRECORD 

                                                                             359

            - You may test your connection by communicating (mentally) 
              instructions for signals for yes/no responses (such as light 
              getting brighter for less and darker for no) and then 
              mentally ask questions and observe the responses. 
           
          o When you have found an areas that seems to be responsive and 
            receptive, begin walking to the area, while beaming love 
            energy.  Extend your aura to the area and sense the energy.  
           
           
          ENTERING A POWER SPOT: 
           
          o Before entering a power spot, ask permission to enter.  If the 
            response is good, enter; if not, locate another more receptive 
            area.   
           
          o When entering the power spot, look around.  Perhaps the 
            responsive energy will be concentrated around some singularity 
            (a bush, a tree, a specific branch, a moss covered rock, or 
            other entity that stands out).  Perhaps the energy will be more 
            general.  Use your intuition and feedback from the spirits to 
            guide your actions. 
           
          o If it feels right, send out a signal that you would like to 
            touch the singularity (or the ground) for better communication.  
            If the response is good, approach beaming love energy, and then 
            touch or hug the singularity (or the ground).   
           
          o Treat the spirits as you would other Pagans you meet for the 
            first time - be sensitive, open, and listen. 
           
           
          DEEPENING COMMUNICATION WITH NATURE SPIRITS: 
           
          o Now that you have made contact with spirits that seem 
            receptive, deepen the communication: 
            - Breathe deep breaths from the diaphragm, and with each 
              breath, feel more refreshed.   
            - Now imagine that your spine is the trunk of a tree; and, from 
              its base, roots extend deep into the Earth.  Deep into the 
              rich moist Earth.   
            - With every breath, feel the roots extending deeper, 
            - Feel the energy deep within the Earth and within the waters 
              of the Earth.  Feel your roots absorbing nourishment from the 
              Earth and from its waters.   
            - Feel the moist, warm energy rising.   
            - Feel it bursting up from the Earth and rising up your spine, 
              like sap rises in a tree.   
            - Feel the energy rise to your crown chakra (at the top of your 
              head). 
            - Now imagine that you have branches, branches that sweep up 
              and then bend down towards the Earth, like the limbs of a 
              willow.   
            - Feel the branches extending and interweaving with your 
              surroundings.

                                                                             360

            - Feel the warm, moist energy of the Earth flowing through your 
              branches.  As it flows, feel yourself being purified, 
              centered, and connected to the Earth.   
            - Feel the power from the Earth flowing through your branches 
              and then down back to the Earth, like a fountain. 
            - Note how your branches absorb energy from the air.  Also, 
              feel them receiving light (fire) from the sky.   
            - Feel the energy from above penetrating deep through your body 
              into the Earth. 
            - Feel the warmth of the Earth rising also.   
            - Feel the energy circulating. 
           
          o Notice how your branches intertwine with the branches of energy 
            surrounding you.   
            - Feel the energy dancing among your branches and the branches 
              around you. 
            - Notice how your roots also intertwine with underground energy 
              channels.   
            - Feel the energy dancing between your roots and the  
              surrounding energy patterns.  
            - Notice how you and the life around you are rooted in the 
              same Earth, breathing the same air, receiving the same fire, 
              drinking the same water,  sharing the same underlying 
              essence.  You are one with the magical grove. 
           
          o Telepathically mention the time in the past when nature spirits 
            and people communicated regularly and the need to establish 
            such communication now.  
           
          o Test your connection by asking questions and observing the 
            responses. 
           
           
          WORKING WITH NATURE SPIRITS: 
           
          o Explain to the spirits the purpose of your coming to them and 
            the nature of the ritual you plan.   
           
          o If the spirits you contacted are receptive: 
            - Explain to them the details of the ritual and invite them to 
              provide ideas. 
            - Listen, you may receive suggestions on how to improve the 
              ritual.  Such suggestions may come in the form of hunches, 
              visions, answers to yes/no questions using pre-arranged 
              signals, or in other ways. 
            - Explain what type of space is needed and ask what the best 
              place to perform the ritual is.  
            - You may see light or get other psychic signals leading you 
              to other sites, or you may be at one of them.   
            - You may also ask what the best places for other aspects of 
              the planned work are (picnicking, individual vision quests, 
              etc.). 
            - If preparation of the site is needed (removing briars, 
              preparing a fire circle, etc.) ask permission of the spirits 
              before proceeding with such action.

                                                                             361

            - Before you leave the power spot, tell the spirits you have 
              contacted when you plan to return to do the ritual 
              (visualizing the associated lunar and solar aspects can help 
              with this communication). 
            - Invite them to join in the ritual when you return and to 
              bring their friends.   
            - Ask if it would be best to return silently, with drums, with 
              chanting, or with some other form of approach. 
            - You can also ask the spirits to provide guidance for working 
              in balance and to provide a teacher to provide further 
              guidance. 
           
          o Before you leave the power spot: 
            - Thank the spirits,  
            - Channel love energy,  
            - Trigger your memory of the experience, and 
            - If it feels right, leave an offering of tobacco, or beer and 
              honey poured on the ground (or other suitable material). 
           
          o  Leave in peace and love. 
           
          o Proceed to other sites that were indicated by the spirits, 
            doing similar meditations at each site.   
           
          o If you need something, like a staff, a Maypole, or a wand, you 
            can also ask where you can find it and follow the guidance you 
            receive (not slavishly, but as you would guidance from another 
            Pagan). 
           
          o Before leaving the general area in which you found power spots 
            and contacted nature spirits: 
            - Channel love energy towards the receptive sites you found, 
            - Thank the spirits of the land,  
            - Pull back your roots and branches,  
            - Ground any excess energy into the Earth (placing your hands 
              on the Earth, breathe in any excess energy, and channel the 
              energy down your arms, while visualizing and feeling the 
              energy going into the Earth), and  
            - Leave in peace and love.   
           
          o Naturally, you should leave the area at least as clean, and 
            preferably cleaner, than you found it.  
           
          o If you work with techniques of Wicca or Ceremonial Magic, you 
            may find that by casting a circle, calling the Elements, the 
            Goddess, the Gods, and the local nature spirits while you are 
            at receptive sites, you may be able to greatly increase 
            communication. 
           
          o Through the use of drums and other power raising techniques, it 
            is even possible to energize receptive nature spirits.  The 
            results can be very interesting.  If with a coven, such circles 
            can be done as part of a group attunement to a power spot you 
            have located.

          o If you do not get good feelings in response to your explanation 
            of the ritual and are unable to come up with a ritual that 
            gives good responses, do not try to force a good response.  You 
            would only be fooling yourself.   
            - Thank the spirits for their attention. 
            - Ask them why they are not receptive (if it feels right and 
              they are communicative). 
            - Trigger your memory.  
            - Pull back your &quot;roots and branches,&quot; return any excess 
              energy you feel into the Earth. 
           -  If it feels appropriate, leave an offering of tobacco or 
              other appropriate material, out of respect for the spirits. 
            - Move to a more receptive site.   
             
          o If it is hard to find a site that is really receptive, you 
            should: 
            - Consider any impressions you got of why the nature spirits 
              weren't receptive in the area you were in, and re-think your 
              plans for a ritual, as necessary and appropriate. 
            - It may also be appropriate to look for another general area 
              in which to find a suitable power site that is receptive to 
              the work planned. 
           
           
          WHAT TO DO WHEN RETURNING: 
           
          It can be very powerful to purify and center yourself and to 
          attune to the spirits of the land using the techniques previously 
          described for calling nature spirits immediately upon returning 
          to the site.   
           
          Often, individuals may have found small specific power spots to 
          which they have a special attunement, where the spirits are 
          interested in participating; but where the site is too small, has 
          too much vegetation, or is otherwise unsuitable for the main 
          ritual.  Individual attunement to the spirits in such areas and 
          inviting them to participate in the main ritual can be 
          worthwhile. 
           
          Then approach the main ritual site using the previously arranged 
          technique.  You should have the details worked out with the 
          spirits of the land.  An exceptionally powerful technique 
          involves doing a procession through or past receptive power 
          spots, inviting nature spirits to join as you pass each power 
          spot, and then moving to the central power spot for the main 
          ritual.  If participants are at individual power spots, they can 
          join the procession as it passes nearby. 
           
          When consecrating space in the wild, or casting a circle, do not 
          set up the perimeter as a barrier to all outside forces; it 
          should be a beacon to attract friendly nature spirits, a 
          container for holding magical power, and a barrier to spirits 
          who it isn't right to be with.

          One thing that is fun and worthwhile in nature is to bring 
          instruments, such as a rattle, a flute and/or a drum, to tune in 
          to nature's sounds, and to make music in time to nature's 
          sounds.  You may be able to get some very interesting back and 
          forth exchanges of music going with selected creatures of the 
          wild, and get into an amazing jam session. 
           
          After the work is complete, be sure to thank the spirits for 
          their participation.  Libations and other offerings may also be 
          left for the spirits during and/or after the ritual. 
           
           
          ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: 
           
          There are other ways of working with nature spirits.  This is one 
          approach.  The author thanks Selena Fox for teaching the basic 
          guided meditation technique for locating and contacting nature 
          spirits at a tranceworking session sponsored by the Chameleon 
          Club (part of the Association for Consciousness Exploration) in 
          1981, Vicky Smith for editorial review of this article, Isaac 
          Bonewitz for the outline of the expanded tree meditation, and 
          Carlos Castenada, Black Eagle, Pasha, the Goddess, the Gods, and 
          various nature spirits for teaching the rest of the good methods.
