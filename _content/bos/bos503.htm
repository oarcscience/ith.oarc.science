                 LORD OF THE DANCE      
                                        
  In response to many requests for information about the neo-pagan 
  version of Lord Of The Dance....      
                                        
  The words are credited to Aidan Kelly, C. Taliesin Edwards, and Ann 
  Cass; the tune (when it isn't &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;) is credited to Jenny 
  Peckham-Vanzant, and may be an old shape-note hymn. 
                                        
  Aidan Kelly and C. Taliesin Edwards may be the same person. 
                                        
  According to the article in the filksong magazine &quot;Filker Up #3,&quot; (a 
  reprint from _Kantele_ #12, Fall 1982, and written by Cathy Cook-
  MacDonald), the first four verses were written by Kelly and Edwards, 
  four more by Ann Cass in 1975-6, and the four seasonal verses by Ann 
  Cass in 1976. Gwydion recorded the song, with variant lyrics, on his 
  _Songs Of The Old Religion_ tape (not the entire song, though). 
                                        
  A version of it can also be found on the tape _Celtic Circle Dance_, 
  by Joe Bethancourt.

  She danced on the water, and the wind was Her horn 
  The Lady laughed, and everything was born 
  And when She lit the sun and its' light gave Him birth 
  The Lord of the Dance first appeared on the Earth 
                                        
(Chorus): Dance, dance, where ever you may be 
          I am the Lord of the Dance, you see! 
          I live in you, and you live in Me 
          And I lead you all in the Dance, said He! 
                                        
  I danced in the morning when the World was begun 
  I danced in the Moon and the Stars and the Sun 
  I was called from the Darkness by the Song of the Earth 
  I joined in the Song, and She gave Me the Birth! 
                                        
  I dance in the Circle when the flames leap up high 
  I dance in the Fire, and I never, ever, die 
  I dance in the waves of the bright summer sea 
  For I am the Lord of the wave's mystery 
                                        
  I sleep in the kernel, and I dance in the rain 
  I dance in the wind, and thru the waving grain 
  And when you cut me down, I care nothing for the pain; 
  In the Spring I'm the Lord of the Dance once again! 
                                        
  I dance at the Sabbat when you dance out the Spell 
  I dance and sing that everyone be well 
  And when the dancing's over do not think that I am gone 
  To live is to Dance! So I dance on, and on! 
                                        
  I see the Maidens laughing as they dance in the Sun 
  And I count the fruits of the Harvest, one by one 
  I know the Storm is coming, but the Grain is all stored 
  So I sing of the Dance of the Lady, and Her Lord:         (more) 
                                        
                    Lord Of The Dance (Cont.)               

                                                                            2287

                                        
  The Horn of the Lady cast its' sound 'cross the Plain 
  The birds took the notes, and gave them back again 
  Till the sound of Her music was a Song in the sky 
  And to that Song there is only one reply: 
                                        
  The moon in her phases, and the tides of the sea 
  The movement of the Earth, and the Seasons that will be 
  Are the rhythm for the dancing, and a promise thru the years 
  That the Dance goes on thru all our joy, and tears 
                                        
  We dance ever slower as the leaves fall and spin 
  And the sound of the Horn is the wailing of the wind 
  The Earth is wrapped in stillness, and we move in a trance, 
  But we hold on fast to our faith in the Dance! 
                                        
  The sun is in the southland and the days grow chill 
  And the sound of the horn is fading on the hill 
  'Tis the horn of the Hunter, as he rides across the plain 
  And the Lady sleeps 'til the Spring comes again 
                                        
  The Sun is in the Southland and the days lengthen fast 
  And soon we will sing for the Winter that is past 
  Now we light the candles and rejoice as they burn 
  And we dance the Dance of the Sun's return! 
                                        
  They danced in the darkness and they danced in the night 
  They danced on the Earth, and everything was light 
  They danced out the Darkness and they danced in the Dawn 
  And the Day of that Dancing is still going on!       
                                        
  I gaze on the Heavens and I gaze on the Earth 
  And I feel the pain of dying, and re-birth 
  And I lift my head in gladness, and in praise 
  For the Dance of the Lord, and His Lady gay 
                                        
  I dance in the stars as they whirl throughout space 
  And I dance in the pulse of the veins in your face 
  No dance is too great, no dance is too small, 
  You can look anywhere, for I dance in them all! 
                                        
                            *           
                                        

                                                                            2288
