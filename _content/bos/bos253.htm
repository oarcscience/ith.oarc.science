              -------------------------------------------------------------

                                SAMHAIN RITUAL: 31 October 
                                     by the White Bard

          Materials: one cauldron, filled with water
                     CRONE: This should be an older female.
                     OLD KING: This should be a person chosen by
                               lottery, or by whoever is acting as
                               Crone. It can be enacted by the HP
                               if needed.
                     BARD/GREEN MAN: If the coven has no Bard available,
                                     then a Green Man should be chosen
                                     by lottery, or by whoever is acting
                                     as Maiden. It can be enacted by the
                                     HP, if needed.

                   ------------------------------------------------

          %  The place of ritual should be set up, away from the gathered
          %  participants. This is not something that people should miss,
          %  so make sure that potty break is taken care of before the
          %  circle is cast.

          HPS: Go we now to the sacred place
               And stand within the sacred space
               Turn your minds to sacred things
               And dance with me unto the ring!

          %  HP and HPS lead the coven to the place of ritual by a
          %  spiral dance, ending in a circle around the altar. The
          %  cauldron should be at the south. The Old King dances at
          %  the end of the line.

          HPS: Come we forth, with the Spiral Dance
               Within the Lady's radiance
               To mark the turning of the year
               The door to Winter now is here.

               Earth and Water, Fire and Air
               I invoke the Goddess there!
               This night we are Between the Worlds
               To celebrate the year unfurled!

          HP: Earth and Water, Fire and Sky
              I invoke the God on high
              This night we are Between the Worlds
              To celebrate the year unfurled!

          %   The corners shall be called thusly, that all may hear, but
          %   shall not be called until the HPS reaches that corner on her
          %   circumnabulation.



                                                                            1117

          EAST:   O Guardians of the Eastern Tower,

                  Thus I invite you to this tower

                  Come to us; and Blessed Be!

          %  The HPS shall move to each corner, and say, following each
          %  corner's crying as she moves to the next:

          HPS: So I cast and consecrate
               This Circle of the small and great:
               By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree,
               By Rock and Earth, by Land and Sea,
               By Fire and Water, Earth and Air,
               By the Lord, and Lady Fair!
               By Love and Joy and Work and Play,
               All things harmful cast away!
               By lightening's flash, and rain's soft fall,
               By the Power that made us all;
               By the Power that blesses Thee:
               (Cast the Circle: Blessed be!)

          %  On her return to the first corner she shall change the last
          %  line above, and say:

               The Circle's cast; and Blessed Be!



                                                                            1118

          %  The callers of the corners shall return their tools to the
             altar, and then shall join the circle at their corners.

                  --------------------------------------------------

          %  Here begins the Samhain Mystery:

          OLD KING: Thus I invoke the Lady White
                    To come to us this sacred night.
                    By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree,
                    I shall show you a Mystery!

          % Bard/Green Man and Maiden join hands, facing each other.

          MAIDEN: Lord of Life, hail Land-Master!
                  God of grain that grows and dies
                  Rising reborn, full of richness;
                  Fallow fields shall yet be fertile --

              Note: These Norse style verses were taken from a file I got
                    (I think) from Paul Seymour. Don't know who author is.



                                                                            1120

          CRONE: One-eye, Wanderer, God of wisdom,
                 Hunt-lord, hail, who leads the hosting!
                 Nine nights hanging, knowledge gaining,
                 Cloaked at crossroads, council hidden.
                 Now the night, your time, is near us --
                 Right roads send us on, Rune-winner.

          OLD KING: Every age your eyes have witnessed;
                    Cauldron-Keeper, hail wise Crone!
                    Rede in riddles is your ration --
                    Wyrd-weaver at the World-tree's root.
                    Eldest ancient, all-knowing one,
                    Speak unto us, send us vision!

          %   Here the HPS should say:

                  ----------------------------------------------------
          %   A normal cone-of-power may be raised, for growth and healing:

          HPS: In a ring we all shall stand
               Pass the Power, hand to hand.

          HP: As the season turns again
              Power flows from friend to friend

          HPS: Pass the Power, hand to hand
               Bless the Lady, bless the Land

          HP: Bless the Lord, and bless the Skies
              Bless the Power that never dies!

          %   The above four verses should be repeated three times, or as
          %   many times as needed, and the HPS shall then say:

          HPS: By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree:
               Let the Power flow out and free!

          %   All should release, at this point.

                  ------------------------------------------------------

          %   Any needed coven business may be transacted here.

                  ------------------------------------------------------

          %   The Circle is opened:    
   
          HPS: Thus I release the East and West
               Thanks to them from Host to Guest
               Thus I release the South and North
               With &quot;Blessed Be' I send them forth!
               The Circle's open, dance we so
               Out and homeward we shall go.
               Earth and Water, Air and Fire
               Celebrated our desire.
               We think of those in Summerland
               Who dance together, hand in hand.
               By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree,
               Our circle's done; and Blessed Be!

          COVEN: Blessed Be!

          %   All spiral dance out from the Circle, led by HP and HPS.
