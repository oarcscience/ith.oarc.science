              The first session of  the year-XXIV Order of Shuti  Workshop discussed
              symbolism.

              While the  study of symbolism itself  is not a primary  concern of the
              Order of Shuti, several  of the Order's activities do  involve working
              with forms of symbolism, or are discussed using various symbols.

              The symbols of the twin lion gods, Shu and Tefnut, who together are
              Shuti, are obviously of importance in understanding the activities
              of the Order.  The topic of symbolism was therefore chosen for the
              introductory session of the workshop.

                                           Application

              In discussing this session and what would be discussed, the Grand
              Master stressed that symbolism wasn't to be discussed simply as an
              intellectual exercise, but that all participants should try to
              apply the Setian yardstick of "application" to this discussion.

              Each and every topic of this session (and all sessions in the
              workshop) should be measured by the questions of a) Can it be
              applied? b) Is it useful? c) Does it work?

                                       What is symbolism?

              One answer suggested by workshop participants is that symbolism is
              a language of the unconscious.

              It is a dynamic language in which one image, a single symbol, can
              conjure up archetypical impressions, complex or complete concepts
              and/or meanings, rather than being a structured language in which
              many words and/or several sentences are needed to put together an
              equivalent concept or meaning.

              Another purpose of symbolism offered by the participants is to
              serve as a metalanguage which has two levels or multiple levels of
              meaning.

                                                                                1561          


              Each symbol or set of symbols can have one meaning to the
              initiated, and another meaning to the uninitiated.  That symbol or
              set of symbols could also have /different/ meanings to the
              initiated, depending upon how the symbols are communicated, and how
              they are mixed with other symbols.  A statement in a symbolic
              language could even have multiple meanings communicated at the same
              time to the same person.

              A lot of the symbols Setians use in our writings are like that.
              When we read through the _Scroll of Set_ or the jewelled Tablets,
              those of us who have been using the language of the Temple of Set
              for a while will see certain words, and will know just from the way
              the words are used that the author is writing symbolically as well
              as grammatically, and he therefore means "this type of thing".

              This symbolic use of language lets us add meaning to an article
              without adding substantially to the size of that article.

              Those who haven't been in the Temple of Set long enough to pick up
              on that symbolic use of language will miss almost all of that
              meaning on their first reading.

              This is one of the reasons why we all find it useful to reread past
              issues of the _Scroll_ and to reread Tablet articles.  It enables
              us to read meaning in an article that we may have missed on an
              earlier reading.

              It sometimes happens that "unintended" meaning is found in an
              article during such a rereading.

              Even though the author may not have consciously intended to convey
              a certain meaning, that author's Higher Self may have influenced
              the writing in such a way as to symbolically give a specific
              message in the writing.  These messages remain hidden except for
              those who can perceive and understand them.

              On the other side of the scale, if our writings are read by someone
              totally unfamiliar with occult symbolism, then the message can be
              totally lost, and the reader may never see it.

              Symbolism can be visual (examples are the Pentagram of Set,
              pictures of the Egyptian Neters, etc), and verbal (the closing we
              use on our letters, "Xeper and Remanifest", is a statement and
              reminder of our dedication to this Formula, a way of developing and
              keeping the habit of Xeper and Remanifestation going strong).

              Each Word itself is a symbol (Xeper, Indulgence, Thelema, etc.),
              as is each Neter (Shu, Tefnut, Sekhmet, Bast).  A lot of principles
              can be used as symbols which have more meaning to the initiated
              than they do to those who just read about them in a dictionary.

              Visual and verbal/written symbols involve just one of our senses
              (sight).  If you include verbal/spoken symbols, we then involve a
              second sense (hearing).  We then asked the question, "Are there
              symbols which are perceived and communicated through each of our
              other senses?"

                                                                                1562          


              The first examples offered by workshop participants were incense
              and music: Incense can bring about different emotions and responses
              through the sense of smell.  Music can bring about different
              responses through the sense of hearing, in ways totally different
              than the verbal symbols do (the difference between right brained
              behavior and left brained behavior).

                                 Where does symbolism come from?

              When dealing with incense and music, we are leaving the mental
              processes and intellectual reactions that visual symbols will
              evoke, and going instead to the more reactive, bodily, reactions.

              We react to the smell of bodily feces with distaste because of the
              body's reaction to that sort of an input.  We find the fragrance
              of a rose very pleasing.

              One of the reasons we use fragrant incenses during a ritual is to
              bring about bodily reactions which enhance a ceremony because of
              the smells and our reactions to the smells.

              The discussion of one question leads to another.  We learn the
              reactions / interpretations / meanings of visual and verbal symbols
              (at least those discussed above).  Do we also learn reactions to
              incenses and music, or are those reactions more innate?

              The first response was that our reactions and interpretations, even
              our likes and dislikes of music are learned.

              The example given was classical music, which strikes some people
              as very soothing and relaxing, and which is likely to put these
              people to sleep.  But others who are aware of the intelligent
              dynamics and many other ingredients of classical music will find
              the same music very stimulating.

              (We believe that the workshop participant was thinking about the
              lighter classical pieces, such as "Tales from the Vienna Woods,"
              and not the more active pieces such as "Night on Bald Mountain.")

              The second response disagreed with the first, pointing out that
              regardless of whether they are used in classical, modern, or any
              other form of music, harps and strings tend to evoke emotional
              (peaceful) moods, while drums are more primal and physical, evoking
              more active responses.

              The next example we discussed referred to the sense of smell.  To
              a farmer, feces and fertilizer are pleasing and filled with
              promise, a smell of promised growth and life, a totally different
              reaction than most people will have (especially after scraping a
              dog's refuse off the bottom of one's shoe).

              Similarly, an inlander's first pleasant reaction to sea gulls on
              wing, grace in motion, can be compared to the reaction of those who
              live on the beach and have to live with the noise and the mess and
              the droppings left behind by those very same sea gulls.

              These examples tend to support the theory that we learn our
              interpretations of the sounds and smells around us.

                                                                                1563          

              It seems from these examples that our reactions to inputs are
              learned, or at least they arise from our experiences.  The question
              then becomes, can symbols have innate visceral responses, or is the
              response to a symbol necessarily a learned one?

              To look at innate responses, the original responses to stimuli, we
              necessarily looked at children.

              For instance, children generally have no innate response to feces,
              and will often eat them until they learn not to.  They later learn
              to either react with disgust to feces, or to view them as
              fertilizer and the source of life.

              The first example of a possibly innate response brought to the
              discussion was that of the ephemeral beauty of a butterfly on the
              wing.  None of the participants could envision any child's reaction
              other than awe and delight at such beauty (or at least none would
              admit to any other vision).

              This brought forth remarks concerning innate childish "awe", where
              almost everything is new and wonderful.

              Children as they begin to distinguish between the multiple events
              and objects in their world are simply delighted at the beauty and
              diversity they find around them.  There is no "evil" during this
              time -- only the beauty of nature.

              Few of us have any reason to unlearn this initial response to the
              butterfly.  These reactions can therefore be considered innate,
              stemming from the earliest days of our consciousness.  Other
              reactions, unpleasant reactions and also more complex reactions,
              seem to be learned over time.

              Therefore, there's some of both types of reactions.  People will
              have initial reactions to many meaningful symbols and inputs, but
              their reactions can be modified by their experience and training.

              This discussion raised yet more questions, for which no answers
              were attempted during this workshop.  The questions were, how much
              of our symbolism is learned, and how much of our symbolism is
              innate? And if some form of consciousness or memory can survive
              from one life to another, then how much might be remembered from
              past lives?

              Symbols may or may not come to one's attention.  An extremely
              visually-oriented person may not notice or respond to other types
              of symbols, such as a room's smell, or a background level of music,
              while those who are oriented towards those senses will respond to
              those inputs, but perhaps not to others.

              Symbolism may have personal and/or experiential meaning (such as
              the manure used to plant your garden or that you step in), or
              symbolism may be abstract (learned and used in writing, teaching,
              or jewelry, but not something that's impacted upon you in the
              past).  This is the difference between a) the visceral response,
              which may be innate and may also be a learned response, modified
              through experience or training, and b) the mental response which
              must always be learned or developed.

                                                                                1564          


              The Grand Master wishes to note that the discussion at this point
              had unintentionally left the strict topic of symbolism, and was
              dealing instead with experience and reaction to stimuli, on the
              unspoken assumption that these reactions applied to our use of
              symbolism.

              We feel this to be a valid assumption, since the pleasant reaction
              we have to a butterfly or to a unicorn extends to and impacts our
              use of those images as symbols.  Those with differing reactions to
              sea gulls as described above would similarly have different
              reactions to Johnathon Livingston Seagull's story.

              Also, by concentrating on experience and reaction rather than
              symbolism, we temporarily lost sight of the most important measure
              of symbolism -- that of meaning.

              Yes, music has impact, but that music is symbol only if its impact
              includes meaning, such as the sense of freedom and power that
              accompanies the visual image of the "Flight of the Valkyries" and
              similar images of meaning those who are familiar with the movie
              will get from various pieces in the sound track from 2001.

              Likewise incense is symbol only if its impact includes meaning.

              That meaning may be supplied by the smell, or that meaning may be
              supplied by knowledge of the ingredients within the incense.
              Meaning may also be supplied by the words used during the censing
              of the chambre.  Without some meaning, incense is not symbol, but
              only smell.

              Closely related to the sense of smell is the sense of taste, and
              it's fairly easy to see that certain tastes can have meaning as
              well.

              During Passover Seder, a ritual meal of thanksgiving and freedom
              (celebrating the Exodus), Jews will dip greens into salt water and
              eat the salty greens, to remind them of tears shed by the Jews in
              bondage.  They will eat bitter herbs to remind them of the
              bitterness of slavery.

              Likewise, there can be kinesthetic symbols as well.

              We feel different when we hold a sword in ritual as opposed to when
              we hold a dagger.  We feel different when we are standing up than
              we feel when we are sitting down, and different still when we are
              kneeling or laying down.  We feel different in charged rooms, dry
              rooms, wet rooms, hot rooms, cold rooms, still rooms, breezy rooms.
              Uncontrolled, these latter experiences are just stimuli.
              Controlled and used meaningfully, these latter experiences can be
              symbols, manipulated and understood as such.

                                  How should symbolism be used?

              The first obvious use of symbolism is in the communication of
              ideas, whether written, spoken, or communicated through one or more
              other senses.

                                                                                1565          


              Based on the idea that a single symbol can have a whole galaxy of
              meaning, a useful communications skill is the ability to use
              symbols in the proper places, in the proper ways, to communicate
              more meaning in a smaller package (with fewer words).

              Perhaps of greatest importance within the Temple of Set are the
              magical aeonic Words: Xeper, Remanifestation, and Xem, and the
              preceding Words of Indulgence and Thelema.  By using these Words
              in writing or other forms of communication, we communicate the
              meanings associated with those Words.

              If I say the word "Xeper" to an initiate, it means something
              totally different than it would mean to someone off the street, and
              it means something totally different to a Setian than it would mean
              to an Egyptologist who /thinks/ he knows the Egyptian god Xepera.
              Our use of the Word is quite different and the symbol carries so
              much more meaning than just the word "Xeper" would carry in a
              modern Egyptian dictionary.

              This use of symbolism doesn't apply just to magical Words or
              Formulae, but applies to symbols of many different kinds, in many
              different uses.

              You'll sometimes find certain words capitalized in text, as are
              "Words" and "Formulae" above.  When not overly used, this is a
              clear indication that the author wishes you to view these words
              with their symbolic meanings, rather than their normal meanings.

              During group ritual, certain words will be spoken more
              flamboyantly, perhaps louder, perhaps longer, and often with more
              gesturing.  These words are then generally being used symbolically,
              with special meaning at least to the speaker, if not to other
              participants.

              Symbolism can also be used in Lesser Black Magic, as tools to
              influence certain people (singular or multiple) in certain ways.
              The magician (or politician or religious leader or arts director
              or other manipulator) will use lighting, music, fragrance, and
              other symbols in ways particular to their audience's response to
              the symbols.

              Symbolism can be used upon ourselves in a similar manner, to bring
              out responses from us that we want to bring out, as in ritual or
              as an aid to Xeper.

              Words which have become symbols to us can be used as a means of
              increased concentration, as a visual mantra or as a sensual mantra.
              Such mantras can be used in ritual, in nonritual meditation, or
              whenever we choose to remind ourselves of the principles carried
              within that symbol.

              Over time, some symbols can become richer and can carry more and
              more meaning to those people who work with the symbol.

              These symbols can become "magnetic", in that each use of the symbol
              brings forth yet another repetition of the symbol.  Each reference
              brings forth a constellation of meaning, with one meaning and use
              leading to another.  Each use of the symbol sparks, or attracts,
              another use of the symbol.

                                                                                1566          

              In these cases the symbols will often be repeated over and over
              throughout a conversation or other communication, each time
              exercising one or more of those meanings, and through the course
              of the communication this symbol can almost hold or reflect an
              entire world view.  This is the way the people influenced by the
              symbol see their world.

              At a political rally the symbol might be "America", "Democracy",
              or "the Party" (citizens of other countries may substitute those
              symbols meaningful in your domain).  To some, the symbol might be
              "the Environment".

              The symbol "Xeper" has a similar impact within the Setian culture.

              Group consensus is important for communication through symbols.
              Different groups can have differing uses of symbols, and attempts
              to communicate between these groups using the symbols particular
              to one group (or those symbols which are viewed differently by
              different groups) can result in confusion or worse.

              Because Setians come from such diverse backgrounds, we have various
              communication problems related to these diverse backgrounds.

              Members from the O.T.O. may know all of the Qabalic
              correspondences, while members from the Wiccan background couldn't
              care less about the Qabalic attributions, and have correspondences
              which are totally different.  Numerologists apply different
              meanings to their numbers than do the Qabalists.  And all of these
              symbolic systems work.

              But very, very few of them work for all Setians.

              Qabalists within the Temple of Set who write articles and/or
              letters steeped in Qabalic symbolism find that very few others care
              enough about their symbols to wade through the text.  Those from
              other backgrounds with intensive use of symbols similarly find
              difficulty communicating within the Temple of Set, since our
              symbolic vocabulary is so much less cohesive.

              This lack of similarity in symbolism affects not only written
              communication, but also ritual activity.

              Each pylon seems to develop its own pattern of symbolism, and
              inter-pylon rituals can at times be very difficult.  Fitting many
              diverse magicians with their diverse backgrounds into one
              meaningful ceremony can be a challenge, a challenge faced at each
              Conclave, and at each activity like the Order of Shuti Workshop.

                                                                                1567          


                                  Language of the Unconscious?{fn 1}

              The first question asked by the Grand Master was, "What is
              symbolism?" The first answer received was, "A language of the
              unconscious."

              Parts of the workshop's discussion might seem to support this
              definition, while others contradict it.  So let the Grand Master
              speak:

              Symbols have many attributes.  Among the more important of these
              attributes is their ability to cause reaction in their audience,
              visceral if not innate reactions, as discussed above.

              Elizabeth S. Helfman, in her book _Signs and Symbols around the
              World_, defines symbol as being: "anything that stands for
              something else."

              Look in your dictionary.  Mine includes several definitions of
              symbol and symbolism, including:

              >> Symbol: 2: something that stands for or suggests something
              else
              by reason of relationship, association, convention, or accidental
              resemblance. 5: an act, sound, or object having cultural
              significance and the capacity to excite or objectify a response.

              >> Symbolism: 1: the art or practice of using symols esp. by
              investing things with a symbolic meaning or by expressing the
              invisible or intangible by means of visible or sensuous
              representations; as a: the use of conventional or traditional
              signs
              in the representation of divine beings and spirits, b: artistic
              imitation or invention that is a method of revealing or
              suggesting
              immaterial, ideal, or otherwise intangible truth or states. 2: a
              system of symbols or representations.

              Symbolism is an art, a practice, something which is done.  It is
              used to communicate meaning.  It is a language.

              Our visceral responses to symbolism may be unconscious, but if
              that's all there is, then have we received and/or responded to
              meaning?

              The transmission and communication of *Meaning* requires some
              form
              of consciousness.

              Let's use the word /Awake/ to mean the highest form of
              consciousness.   Remember -- the capital letter indicates I'm
              using
              a symbol; Setian use of this specific symbol (Awake) most often
              refers to Ouspenski's heightened state of consciousness and
              awareness, a state of being totally awake.

                                                                                1568          


              For simplicity, let's assign a whole range of various levels of
              conscious awareness to the name "conscious".  This name can apply
              to heightened states of consciousness which those we would call
              Awake, those that barely miss being Awake, down to the almost
              somnabulent states in which most of mankind spends their day.

              Finally, I would call the preconscious state one of consciousness
              in this case, a state in which meaning can be received,
              interpreted, and acted upon, without the individual being
              "consiously" aware that this has happened.  But if the
              individual's
              attention is brought to the subject, then the symbol and its
              meaning can be recalled and the process repeated without any
              difficulty.

              If symbols are generated and communicated, if they are
              transmitted
              and received, in one of these three states, then I believe we can
              correctly talk about symbolism, about language.

              However, if the generation and/or reception of the symbol is
              unconscious, and/or totally unintended, then I propose that that
              instance is not an example of symbolism, not language or
              communication, but rather the accidental generation of and/or
              visceral response to sensory input.

              [Now let us return to the discussion as it took place in the
              workshop...]

                                    Planetary Symbol System?

              We know there are differences in the meanings of many symbols.
              "Patriotism" can be exceedingly important to a Republican and
              also
              to a Libertarian, but the meanings that this symbol will have can
              be quite different in many ways.

              This leads us to ask the question of whether there might perhaps
              be a "planetary symbol system" in which some symbols at least can
              be found commonly used in many or all cultures.

              The cross, square, circle, and most or all simple symbols have
              been
              found in use all over the earth.  We therefore can ask whether
              their meanings are similar, or are the symbols used simply
              because
              they are simple geometric figures, but with meanings arbitrarily
              assigned by the individual cultures?

              One participant brought forth Ouspenski's example that "Table"
              has
              a function, an innate form or essence, which can be perceived
              beyond words, and beyond a learned experience.

              "Table" provokes an image, feeling, or essence that is evoked
              through a willed perception that extends beyond the actual set of
              tables that a person may have ever experienced.

                                                                                1569          


              Ouspenski claims that at a certain state of consciousness the
              Aware
              individual can see this deeper meaning or essence, and that this
              deeper meaning or essence can be commonly perceived by all who
              reach this level of consciousness.

              Similar ideas were offered by Plato, and the concept of Platonic
              Forms is very prevalent throughout the Setian use of symbolism.
              We often speak of the Egyptian Neters as being Forms, the
              original or specific essence of an Ideal.

              This is certainly an area that needs deeper investigation.  The
              workshop session discussion however left the topic of abstract
              Forms, and instead investigated the historic use of symbols in
              various cultures.

              Looking first at the more complex god forms, it seems each major
              culture has a "trickster" god:  Coyote fills this niche in several
              Amerindian cultures, Loki in the Norse mythos, and Thoth (Hermes
              and Mercury) in the Egyptian (Greek and Roman) mythologies.

              The Trickster is that Spirit who makes you Think.  He is the Spirit
              who is unpredictable in his actions or reactions, who gets himself
              and everyone else into trouble.  In the process of doing so -- most
              often after everyone is already in trouble -- he makes people
              Think, and in the end he generally gets everyone out of trouble by
              thinking.

              To represent the Trickster, each culture used that type of symbol
              or god form which for them was most appropriate for that type of
              character.

              The coyote is a fairly independent and hard to track animal in
              America, requiring more than the usual amount of intelligence and
              stealth to catch.  Monkeys similarly were appreciated for their
              seeming intelligence and playfulness, and so Egyptians assigned the
              Trickster attribute and the monkey's form to Thoth.

              The question becomes ... is this type of being, this symbol,
              something which is universal, cross-cultural, or is it something
              which happens in just a few cases, and many other societies never
              had any use for it?

              Jung was exploring this area.  He defined specific symbols which
              he felt were common to many or all cultures.  They were fairly
              common within his culture and Jung did manage to validate them with
              some cross-cultural study.

              We still need to ask how complete his studies were, how extensive
              and wide spread.

              Given people in extremely different environments, such as the
              Eskimo, Hawaiian, Indian, Tibetan, etc., cultures where the people
              have many different experiences, totally different social and
              physical environments, it can be expected that these people would
              have very different reactions to the symbols that Jung thought he
              had commonality on.

                                                                                1570          


              Jung's _Man and his Symbol_ was recommended by one participant as
              containing documentation on his cross-cultural studies in this
              area.

              Not having access to any resource materials that would answer our
              questions at the time, the workshop session then proceeded into the
              topic of Egyptian Neters and the use of Neters in symbolism.

                                             Neters

              The Workshop discussion of Egyptian Neters started with a brief
              discussion of the Egyptian languages.

              The ancient Egyptians used three different written languages, the
              hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic.

              The demotic language was a mostly alphabetic language used for
              common communications among those who could read and write.  Its
              primary uses were for social and business reasons.

              The hieratic language was a pictographic language related to the
              hieroglyphic, but in which the pictographs were abbreviated and
              simplified to speed writing.  It was used for important state
              documents and many later religious texts.

              The hieroglyphic language was the most ornate of the three
              languages, the most ancient of the three languages, and the most
              symbolic.  It was used for the most important religious and
              philosophical statements, and for the most important state
              declarations.

              Many of the symbols used to form the hieroglyphic language had
              assigned sounds, and many others did not.  In addition to the
              sounds and symbols used to form words, the Egyptians used
              determinatives, signs added to specifically identify each word.
              Through the use of the determinative, it was impossible to mistake
              one written word for another, even if verbal sounds were the same,
              even if the letters used were the same.

              This use of a purely symbolic, picture-oriented language encouraged
              the ability in the learned ancient Egyptians to think with right
              brained methods while doing the left brain activity of reading.

              It also encouraged these educated and intelligent Egyptians to work
              with symbols as they worked with language.  They were able to
              communicate ideas and ideals in a language particularly well suited
              to this purpose.

              Setians use the ancient Egyptian neters as symbols, representing
              aspects of the world, or aspects of the individual.  We feel this
              is very close to the way the higher initiates of the ancient
              Egyptian Temples, the priests of the Temples, and the smarter
              pharaohs used and viewed their neters.  The neters were concepts
              that could be communicated to and shared among the initiated,
              rather than being actual gods and goddesses.

                                                                                1571          


              The common man may very well have believed in the literal existence
              of his many gods and goddesses, but we believe the elite of the
              Egyptian society understood that these neters were purely symbols.
              When the Egyptian elite paid homage to the neters, they paid homage
              to the aspects of the universe or of the self represented by those
              neters.

              One neter of obvious importance is Set.  In dealing with this
              symbol, we try to identify the original meaning of the symbol, and
              try to eliminate the corruptions of the symbol imposed by the later
              rule of Osirian religion.

              Rather than take space here to discuss the corruptions and
              distortions that were applied to the symbol of the neter Set
              through the Osirian culture, we'll simply refer the interested
              student to appropriate books in the reading list: 2A, 2E, 2G, 2W,
              and 2AA.

              It is rather clear that the use and peripheral meanings of the
              neter Set changed over time.  The study of Set must therefore
              include the careful consideration of the source of whatever
              writings are being studied.  Fortunately most other Egyptian
              symbols/god forms did not change significantly over time, and such
              care need not be used in studying and working with them.

              The neters were used and viewed as symbols.  But the Egyptian
              temples _were_ temples, and were recognized as religions, not
              simply as centers of enlightened philosophy.  This brings up the
              question: Do/did the Egyptian Neters actually exist? Were these
              religions founded to worship or work with beings that actually
              existed? Or were they simply the creations of the ancient Egyptian
              priesthoods?

              Rather than tackle immediately the question of whether the Neters
              actually existed, workshop participants first chose to examine ...

                                      Egyptian Priesthoods

              The first statement made about these priesthoods was that each
              temple in Egypt taught a different area of philosophy or knowledge.

              Those temples dedicated to a major neter or god taught that their
              primal Form was the First Cause.  These were the major temples of
              the land, and an initiate who studied at temple after temple would
              be presented with the opposing claims that each god was the god,
              The Creator.

              We noted in our discussion that the priesthoods of several of the
              "minor" neters did not make any such claims.  Thoth as a single
              neter never seemed to be treated as the creator god; nor was Geb.
              However, many of the major neters were treated as creator gods, and
              many gods were intentionally combined into units (such as
              Amon-Thoth-Ra) in order to form a god which would be powerful
              enough to qualify as The creator god.

                                                                                1572          


                                        Neters as Symbols

              We returned to discussing the neters as ways of viewing possibility
              and potentiality, and ways of viewing different aspects of the
              universe and of the individual.

              For example, Ra, the sun god, was a most pervasive and powerful
              being, since every single day, there he is in the sky.  Ra was
              consistent, reliable, and therefore powerful.

              Similarly each force in nature was given a personality, because
              each force in nature has a personality (or seems to, to those who
              humanize such things).  This is the basic principle behind most
              spirits of most animistic religions.

              These personalities are generally reliable.  A rain cloud is going
              to rain; it isn't going to add to the day's heat.  The Nile was not
              going to dry up -- it was going to overflow once a year, and
              deposit good, rich, fertile earth upon the ground.  Each force of
              nature, each personality, was given a name, a face, and a story.

              The most powerful stories, faces, and names are those that belong
              to the creator gods.  There are so many creator gods, that it's
              really difficult to pin down an actual order of precedence.

              This brings up the fact that there are many apparently conflicting
              stories within the Egyptian mythology.

              The Grand Master pointed out that in several Egyptian myths, Shu
              and Tefnut are self-created.  In others they were created by tears
              of the master creator god (whoever he happened to be according to
              the story teller).  In yet others they were created by the master
              god's masturbation.

              Shu and Tefnut by definition are the first male and female.  The
              master god's masturbation in these latter stories was always male
              masturbation, but Shu is the first male.  Shu and Tefnut begat Geb
              and Nut, but Nut was the all-pervasive universal sky that preceded
              the first god...

              This confusion is the result of centuries of Egyptian story
              telling, and while some of it appears to be contraditory, most of
              it is useful.  We certainly must hesitate to consider this
              mythology as one consistent symbolism, and must be careful if we
              wish to communicate consistent meanings using these symbols, but
              we have found value in this mythology.

              Each story is a different way of looking at the world, a different
              way of looking at the first cause, and of looking at the symbols.
              By using these symbols, we can then indicate not only a symbol, but
              also which way we are looking at the world.

              Hence, if in ritual or other communication we call upon
              Ptah-Geb-Nu, we are calling upon the creator of the earth and sky,
              the god who created the physical universe.  If instead we call upon
              the Neter Ra-Ptah-ankh, we are calling upon the god who brought
              light and life to this planet.

                                                                                1573          

              Having discussed these differing views of the world as expressed
              by the many symbolic neters, we felt that this was a good point
              from which to launch into a discussion of one of the ways in which
              we look at Neters.

              Set, the prime source of intelligence and the ageless intelligence
              himself, is a wee bit complex for someone a mere 20 or even 200
              years old to understand, regardless of whether we look at Set as
              an actually existing being or instead as a master symbol.

              So rather than try to encompass all of Set, intellectually or
              emotionally, rather than try to understand all of Set, we can work
              with neters which are facets of Set's being, facets of Set's
              symbolism.  Each neter can be thought of as a specific element of
              Set.

              As examples, Shu is one set of symbolism, one set of ideas, that
              an initiate can work with to "get somewhere" with, to accomplish
              certain initiatory goals.  Tefnut is another set of ideas, as is
              Geb, Isis, etc.

              Rather than trying to encompass and work with the entire universe
              simultaneously, grab whatever you can hold onto, work with that
              handful, study that symbol or symbols, and see what it leads to.

              We had originally intended to discuss whether or not the Neters
              might or might not exist in their own right.  Having discussed the
              above, it seemed somewhat unimportant as to whether the Neters
              actually exist.  That topic will be left for a later discussion.

              While the following books and papers were not necessarily discussed
              nor referenced during the workshop discussion (or in completing
              this article), the initiate interested in studying symbolism as a
              subject on its own would be well advised to begin with this
              bibliography.  Additions to this bibliography are welcome, and
              should be sent to the Grand Master.  (_RT_ entries are from _The

              workshop's discussion, and to comment at this time on one of the
              first statements offered during this discussion.
