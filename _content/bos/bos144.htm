                        The Fundamental Laws of Human Ecology

     1.  We're all  in it  together. Everything  is connected  to everything
     else.  You can't do just one thing. &lt;Law of Interrelatedness&gt;

     2. The Earth and its  resources are finite. or You can't  get something
     for nothing. &lt;Law of Conservation of Energy&gt;

     3. As  energy  and other  resources   are  used,  there is  an  overall
     decrease in the amount of usefulness. (Second Law of Thermodynamics&gt;

     4. Everything must go somewhere-there is now away. &lt;Law of Conservation
     of Matter&gt;

     5. Up to a point, the bigger  the better; beyond that point, the bigger
     the worse. or  To everything  there is an  optimum size.  &lt;Brontosaurus
     Principle&gt;

     6. Everything is becoming something else. &lt;Law of Continuous Creation&gt;

     7. In  most cases, the greater  the diversity of a  system, the greater
     its stability. &lt;The Diversity Principle&gt;

     8. Nature frequently but not always &quot;knows&quot; best. Note: People use
     antibiotics to counter nature. &lt;Nature knows best&gt;

     9. We shape our buildings &lt;environment&gt; and afterwards our buildings
     &lt;environment&gt; shape us. - Winston Churchhill &lt;Your Environment is You&gt;

     10. As human beings, one of our inalienable rights is the right to live
     in a clean environment. &lt;The Environmental Bill of Rights&gt;

     11. Our environment does not belong to us alone. It was used by our
     forefathers,  passed  on   to  us,   and  we  are   charged  with   the
     responsibility of passing it undamaged to all future  generations. &lt;the
     Rights of the Unborn&gt;

     12. All persons must be held responsible for their own pollution. &lt;the
     Responsibility of the Born&gt;

     13. All persons are created with an equal right to live in dignity and
     peace and to work out a meaningful existence. Everyone is entitled to a
     fair  share of the world's resources-provided one is carrying one's own
     share of  the responsibilities for  maintaining an orderly  world. &lt;The
     Law of Equity&gt;

     14.  Comfortable  living,  in  harmony  with  nature,  should  be  each
     society's goal. &lt;the Goal of Society&gt;

     15. Our dependence on  technology is, today, so strong  and widespread,
     that we  are compelled to use technology as  a means for getting out of
     our environmental dilemma. &lt;Technology-Part of the Problem, Part of the
     Solution&gt;

     16. No  national  purpose  however urgent,  no  political  or  economic
     necessity however  pressing can possibly  justify the risk  of bringing
     all human history to an end. &lt;Give Earth a Chance&gt;
                                                                         617
