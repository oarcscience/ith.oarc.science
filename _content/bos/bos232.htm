          Each different color  has a  different meaning for  both internal  and
          external  uses.   Here  are a  list of  uses  put together  by Charles

          free to use your own words but  we ask that you use Greek styling  and
          personify with the names of the four Greek winds: 
           
                                             North:  Boreus 
                                              East:  Eurus 
                                             South:  Notus 
                                              West:  Zephyrus 
           
                                Tiresiasseatednorthofaltarrises,goesaroundtoface
          altar, and  invokes God and Goddess  in a Greek style  using these two
          triumverates: 
           
                                                   GOD 
                                             Zeus:  Strength 
                                            Hades:  Knowledge 
                                           Poseidon:  Emotion 
           
                                                 GODDESS 
                                              Hera:  Power 
                                             Athena:  Wisdom 
                                            Aphrodite:  Love 
           
           
                      He then stepback andsays: &quot;We havebeen calledforth fromthe
          edges  of  Time and  Space by  one  who seeks  entry to  the  Halls of
          Olympus.  I  am Tiresias, Prophet of Thebes, who,  though blind, shall
          be his guide.  Seeker, come forth!&quot; 
           

                                                                             984          


                Seeker approaches circle at north-east point of Circle. 
           
                Tiresias:  &quot;Who seeks entry to Olympus?&quot; 
                Seeker:  &quot;I, __________. 
                      Tiresias: &quot;Beforeyou enter,gaze uponone whosought whatwas 
                         not rightfully his.  Do you still desire entry?&quot; 
                Seeker replies. 
                      Tiresias:  (If no,he leaves and circleis closed.  Ifyes): 
          &quot;Then enter and ask passage of the Guardians of the Gods.&quot; 
                Seeker enters and they travel 1 1/8 to North. 
           
                      Tiresias:  &quot;Hail, MightyHephaestus, Craftsman of the Gods.
          With me is one who seeks entry to Olympus.&quot; 
                Hephaestus:  &quot;How are you known, Seeker?&quot; 
                Seeker:  &quot;I am called __________.&quot; 
                      Hephaestus:&quot;By whatright seekyoupassage throughthe North?&quot;
                      Seeker: &quot;I haveendured ayear of thepath ofEarth andlearned
                        of my own mortality.&quot; 
                Hephaestus:  &quot;Pass with the Blessings of the Earth.&quot; 
                They travel around 1 1/4 to East. 
           
                      Tiresias: &quot;Hail,Vigilant Artemis,Virgin Goddess. Withme is
                              one who seeks entry to Olympus.&quot; 
                Artemis:  &quot;How are you known, Seeker?&quot; 
                Seeker:  &quot;I am called __________.&quot; 
                Artemis:  &quot;By what right seek you passage through the East?&quot; 
                      Seeker:  &quot;I have endured a year of the path of Airand have
          learned the need for focus of will.&quot; 
                Artemis:  &quot;Pass with the Blessings of the Air.&quot; 
                They travel around 1 1/4 to South. 
           
                      Tiresias: &quot;Hail, Bright Apollo, Lordof the Sun. With me is
          one who seeks entry to Olympus.&quot; 
                Apollo:  &quot;How are you known, Seeker?&quot; 
                Seeker:  &quot;I am called __________.&quot; 
                Apollo:  &quot;By what right seek you passage through the South?&quot; 
                Seeker has no answer. 
                      Apollo: &quot;Youhave not yetearned theright topass through the
                         South.  To win this  right, you must seek Fire from  he
          who first gave it to Mankind, Prometheus.  Tiresias,             guard
          him upon his path of Fire that he learn what he             needs   to
          face the Titan.&quot; 
                They travel around 1 1/2 to North. 
           
                      Tiresias:  &quot;Icome with __________, whonow seeks Prometheus
          that he may gain the right to Fire.  What can you                teach
          him that will ease his path?&quot; 

                                                                             985          


                      Hephaestus: &quot;Knowthat Iam Hephaestus,Craftsman andSmith of
                              the Gods.  In my labors, I use Fire as a purifying
                              agent, seperating  the metal from  the stone,  and
          for the actual forging of my Art.  But remember                  that
          creativity requires forethought.  Daedalus                  w a s    a
          Master of my Craft, yet rarely considered                   t   h   e
          implications of his creations.  He created the 
          Labyrinth of Minos, who then imprisoned him within               i t s
          intricacies.  He crafted wing that he and his                    s o n
          might escape, yet in their flight Icarus died.  
          Always consider the consequences of the which you 
          create.&quot; 
                They travel 1 1/4 around to East. 
           
                      Tiresias: &quot;I come with __________,who now seeks Prometheus
          that he may gain the right to Fire.  What can you                teach
          him that will ease his path?&quot; 
                      Artemis: &quot;Knowthat I amArtemis, VirginHuntress. Through my
                              will,  no man has ever known me.  Yet will must be
                              tempered  by  intellegence.    Remember  Otus  and
          Ephialtes, twin giants who were arrogant enough to               think
          themselves better than the Gods. They                  continued their
          ill-wrought plans, even after                     Poseidon      warned
          them.  Through supposed desire,                   they chose to pursue
          me.  They seperated in                  pursuit of what they saw  as a
          white hind, and,                   with simultaneous throws, slew each
          other.  Thus                  blind will caused the death  of all they
          truly                    loved.&quot; 
                They travel 1 1/4 around to the South 
           
                      Tiresias:  &quot;Icome with __________, whonow seeks Prometheus
          that he may gain the right to Fire.  What can you                teach
          him that will ease his path?&quot; 
                      Apollo:  &quot;Know thatI am Apollo, Godof the Sun andKeeper of
          Knowledge.  Knowledge of Fire has allowed Man to                 forge
          a civilization.  But seeking to advance                     without
          can lead to catastrophe.  Witness                 Phaethon,        who
          attempted to drive the Sun Chariot                     without  proper
          knowledge, nearly causing the                     incineration  of the
          Earth.  Action without                  knowledge  will often  lead to
          ruin.&quot; 
                They travel around 1 1/4 to the West. 
           
                      Tiresias: &quot;I come with__________, who now seeks Prometheus
          that he may gain the right to Fire.  What can you                teach
          him that will ease his path?&quot; 
                      Hestia: &quot;Know that I amHestia, Goddess of Hearthand Home. 
          The warm glow of emotion in balance is vital for 
          proper growth and life.  But when emotions are 
          allowed to rule above all else, tragedy is soon to 
          follow.  Consider Paris, who upon seeing Helen,                  bowed
          to an all-consuming desire for her,                    kidnapping  her
          without thought of the                  consequences.   Thus began the
          Trojan War.  Do not                     bury   your    emotions,   but
          neither should you elevate                   them  to   the  level  of
          Ruler. 

                                                                             986          


                      Theytravel 1 3/4around to theSouth.  Tiresiasalone goes to
          altar and faces Seeker. 
           
                      Tiresias: &quot;Seeker,are youprepared toface Prometheushimself
                              with your request?&quot; 
                Seeker:  &quot;I am.&quot; 
                Tiresias:  &quot;Then come forward and call him forth.&quot; 
                Seeker goes to altar facing North. 
           
                      Seeker: &quot;From the depths of Time, I call you forth.  Arise
          Prometheus, Lightbringer.&quot; 
                      Fromwithinthe membersin theCircle,Prometheus risesand goes
          to north side of altar. 
           
                Prometheus:  &quot;I am Prometheus.  Who summons me here?&quot; 
                Seeker:  &quot;I am __________.&quot; 
                      Prometheus: &quot;Why haveyou brought me herefrom the depths of
          Time?&quot; 
                Seeker:  &quot;I seek the Gift of Fire.&quot; 
                Prometheus:  &quot;And by what right do you ask it? 
                Seeker:  &quot;By the right of perfect love and perfect trust.&quot; 
                      Prometheus: &quot;Thenknow thatyou are wellmet. I willgrant you
                              Fire and  its path for  a year and a  day that you
          might learn its lessons.  The most important 
          lesson it can teach you is the need for thought
