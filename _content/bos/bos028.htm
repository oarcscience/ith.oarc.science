<h1 align="center">Basic Spell Construction</h1>
<p>Because of the very nature of Magick, each working should be highly 
individualized and personal. Even if following a traditional spell, 
it should be tailored to your specific needs to be most effective 
for you. Understanding the basics of Spell Construction will enable 
you to formulate your own specific, effective spells for any purpose 
you desire.</p>

<p>Preliminary planning is necessary. The very first step is to decide 
precisely what your desired end result is to be. Before you can 
start, you must decide where you are going. You must be very 
explicit.</p>

<p>It is important, also, that you choose your time carefully. You 
should take into consideration all Astrological implications, energy 
currents and Moon phases.</p>

<p>The Moon is the astronomical body closest to us and, therefore, has 
a profound influence upon us, it is very important to choose a time 
when the Moon is in an astrological sign which is appropriate for 
your working. For example: Aries/Action -- Enthusiasm, 
Taurus/Renewal -- Sensuality, Gemini/Communication -- Curiosity, 
Cancer/Emotion -- Nurturing, Leo/Vitality -- Determined, Virgo/Organizing -- 
Studious, Libra/Balance -- Cooperation, Scorpio/Sexual -- 
Philosophical, Capricorn/Authority -- Ambitious, Aquarius/Innovation 
-- Social, Pisces/Sensitivity -- Idealistic.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that magickal workings for gain, increase or bringing 
things to you, should be initiated when the Moon is Waxing (from 
Dark to Full); when the Moon is Waning (from Full to Dark), it is 
time for magickal workings of decrease or sending away.</p>

<p>The highest energy occurs at the Full Moon and, therefore, this is 
the most powerful time for magickal workings. The New Moon is the 
next most powerful time for Magick.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, follow Nature's own energy flows. There 
is a natural time for starting things (a planting time), for 
maturing things (a growing time), for reaping things (a harvest 
time) and, of course, a time for rest and planning.</p>

<p>Flowing with these currents will make your magickal work much easier.</p>

<p>Remember to plan your project for a time of uninterrupted privacy. 
It is important that you have no distractions. Generally speaking, 
it is best to work as late at night as possible. A time when there 
is less frantic energy is most appropriate. You might consider 
Midnight or later.</p>

<p>In choosing a place to do your magickal working pay particular 
attention to your needs, for you must be comfortable. Your place 
should be private, quiet and secure. If at all possible, set aside 
a special place for this purpose only. An unused room, a special 
corner of your bedroom, a quiet, secluded spot in your garden. A 
place that is yours. A place that you can come to whenever need 
arises and that is as free from intrusion of others as possible.</p>

<p>Prior to the night of your magickal working, gather together the 
things that you will need. All of the things used are tools. They 
have no inherent magick. They are to help you create a mood. If 
correctly made and used, they will trigger primitive responses from 
deep within you. They should be chosen with care. 
Consider the purpose of your ritual and choose your tools 
accordingly. If your magick is to be sexual, your candles, oils, 
incenses and so forth should bring forth a sexual response. If the 
desired result of your Magick is tranquility, then the tools should 
make you feel calm, peaceful and serene. Any candles you might use 
should not have commercially added fragrances as these may not be 
appropriate for your working.</p>

<p>Prior to your ritual, prepare yourself and your equipment by any 
means necessary to clean and purify. Historically, people have 
fasted, followed meticulous and detailed bathing practices, 
practiced chastity and used many other methods.</p>

<p>Most often a ritual bath is the preferred method. A bath frequently 
utilizing candlelight, fragrant herbs, bath salts or sensuous oils. 
A sumptuous hot bath, special bathing preparations and appropriate 
lighting, combined, can create the soothing effect which will help 
in the very important step of relaxing and clearing the mind
completely of all mundane thoughts and experiences of the day. Your ritual 
bath should, also, begin to set the specific vibrations conducive to 
your purpose into motion. You must not only cleanse and purify but 
must also begin to create the type of energy necessary. 
Once your purification process has been accomplished, you are now 
ready to begin. Proceed to the special place you have previously 
chosen in which to perform your magick. If at all possible, you 
should make use of the primitive responses set into motion by a well 
chosen piece of music. Your music should start slowly and build to 
a rousing climax.</p>

<p>As you use your oils, light your candle or incense (or utilize any 
other tool you have chosen), you should begin to further intensify 
the energy that you have set into motion around you. A high degree 
of intensity is vitally important.</p>

<p>The Altered State of Consciousness that you must reach is not a 
meditative state. Anything that interferes with your ability to 
concentrate upon, reach and control the high energy state necessary 
to perform magick should be avoided, such as screaming children, a 
sink full of dirty dishes, use of alcohol or drugs, etc.</p>

<p>Do not scatter your energy by attempting to do more than one
magickal working at a time.</p>

<p>Remember that Magick is the manipulation of energy, a thought is a 
form of energy and a visualization is an even stronger form of 
energy. Your visualization can be a method used to intensify 
further and direct your will. Your visualization can be the method 
by which you control the magickal energy you have produced.
You must know what you want. You must see it. You must feel the 
high energy flow. You must direct it.</p>

<p>One of the most important elements in the practice of any form of 
Magick is the Universal Law of Cause and Effect. This means that 
whatever you do (or don't do) you cause something to happen.</p>

<p>The most important consideration is the Universal Law of
Retribution. This means that no matter what you do, it comes back
to you in like kind.</p>

<p>It is the nature of things that as you send something out it gains
momentum, so that, by the time it comes back to you, it is three
times stronger. If you do something nice for someone, someone will
do something nicer for you.</p>

<ul>
&quot;As you weave and
<ul>spin your spell,</ul>
Three fold return<br>
<ul>the tale will tell.&quot;</ul>
</ul>
