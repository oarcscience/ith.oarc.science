                THE HIGH HOLIDAY SONG
                                 -Melusine
           (Tune "The Serving-Girl's Holiday")

            I've waited longing for today
            Spin the bobbin and spool away!
            In joy and bliss I'm off to play
            Upon this high holiday!

    CHORUS: And spin the bobbin and spool away!
            Oh joy that it's a holiday!

            This night of (name) now we greet
            Hail my friends, and merry meet!
            Strike the harp; the drum we'll beat
            Upon this high holiday!

            The wine and cakes we've bought and made
            Found a spot in a moon-lit glade
            Our love and trust will never fade
            Especially on this holiday!

            In forst glade we've built a fire
            Symbol of our heart's desire
            Within Her Love we'll never tire
            Wit thee well this holiday!

            Cast the Circle, we're within
            Let the Spiral Dance begin!
            Invite the Lord and Lady in
            Upon this high holiday!

            Dancing, spinning to the tune
            The Piper plays beneath the moon
            We chant as one the Witches' Rune
            Upon this high holiday!

                          *


                                                                                2332
