            { } denotes an edit. 
            Text in {} has been changed, moved or editied in some fashion AFTER  
          the ritual was complete.

           Ok, you all will need bread, charcoal, a cauldron/braiser of some
          kind... 
           that you can ignite the charcoal in. 
           
           
           Does everyone know what Lammas is all about? 
           
           Ok, Lammas is a ritual dedicated to the Sun God, or the Corn God 
           Or a variety of other Gods that are known as sacrificial gods 
           called because the ancients believed that the sun at it's highest 
          point (middle of summer) died, and that the essense went into the 
          food to sustain life during the long cold winter ahead. This is the 
          time of the Corn King, as was said, the first of the Harvest times 
           when the first crops were brought in. 
           
           ok, then, we begin...

          * (Visualize a cloud of incense falling across 
            the world, cleansing and purifying, and saying,) 
           
            &quot;By the Spirits of Air and Fire I cleanse thee.&quot; 
           
           
            (Visualize a rain of water and the strength of 
            the Earth rising up and say,) 
           
            &quot;By the Creatures of Water and Earth I cleanse thee.&quot; 
           
           
          * (Everyone visualize and connect with the south, 
            the element of Fire.) 
           
            Ye Guardians of the Watchtowers of the South, 
            ye Powers of Fire; Spirits of Illumination and 
            Desire, I do summon, stir, and call you up, to 
            witness our rites and to guard the Circle. 
           
           
            (Connect with the West and the spirit of Water, ) 
           
            Ye Guardians of the Watchtowers of the West, 
            ye Powers of Water; Spirits of Death and 
            Initiation, I do Summon, stir, and call upon 
            you to Witness our Rites and to guard the 
            Circle.

            Ye Guardians of the Watchtower of the North, 
            ye Powers of Earth, Keepers of the Northern 
            Portals, Spirits of Mountain and Plains, I do 
            summon, stir, and call upon you to witness our 
            Rites and to Guard the Circle. 
           
           
            (Connect with the East and the spirit of Air, ) 
           
            Ye Guardians of the Watchtowers of the East, 
            ye Powers of Air; Spirits of Clear Will and 
            Knowledge, I do summon, stir, and call you up, 
            to witness our rites and to guard the Circle. 
           
           
            (Visualize the Earth Herself illuminated in 
            a Circle of silver Light.  ) 
           


                                                                            2103

            The Circle is cast, we are between the 
            worlds, beyond the boundaries of time, where 
            Night and Day Birth and Death, Joy and Sorrow, 
            meet as one. 
           
           
          * Listen to the words of the Great Mother, she 
            whom of old was also called among men Artemis, 
            Astarte, Athena, Dione, Melusine, Aphrodite, 
            Cerridwen, Dana, Arianrhod, Isis, Brid, and by 
            many other names. 
           
            Whenever you have need of any thing, once in 
            the month, and better it be when the Moon is 
            full, then shall ye assemble in some secret 
            place and adore the spirit of Her, who is 
            Queen of all witches.  There shall ye 
            assemble, ye who are fain to learn all 
            sorcery, yet have not won its deepest secrets, 
            to these will She teach things that are yet 
            unknown.  And ye shall be free from slavery, 
            and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall 
            be naked in your rites, and ye shall dance, 
            sing, feast, make music and love, all in Her 
            praise.  For Her's is the secret door that 
            opens upon the Land of Youth, and Her's is the 
            cup of the wine of life, and the Cauldron of 
            Cerridwen, which is the Holy Grail of 
            Immortality.  She is the Gracious Goddess, who 
            gives the gift of Joy unto the hearts of Man. 
            Upon Earth, She gives knowledge of the spirit 
            eternal, and beyond death, She gives peace, 
            and freedom, and reunion with those who have 
            gone before.  Nor does She demand sacrifice, 
            for behold, She is the Mother of all living, 
            and her Love is poured out upon the Earth. 
            Hear ye the words of the Star Goddess, she in 
            the dust of whose feet are the hosts of 
            Heaven, and whose body encircles the 
            Universe. 
           
            She who is the beauty of the green Earth, and 
            the white Moon among the stars, and the 
            mystery of the waters, and the desire of the 
            hearts of man, calls unto thy soul.  Arise, 
            and come unto Her.  For She is the soul of 
            Nature, who gives life to the universe.  From 
            Her all things proceed, and unto Her all 
            things must return, and before Her face, 
            beloved of Gods and of men, let thine 
            innermost divine self be enfolded in the 
            rapture of the infinite.  Let Her worship be 
            within the heart that rejoiceth, for behold, 
            all act of love and pleasure are Her rituals. 
            And therefore let there be beauty and 


                                                                            2104

            strength, power and compassion, honor and 
            humility, mirth and reverence within you.  And 
            thou who thinkest to seek for Her, know thy 
            seeking and yearning shall avail thee not, 
            unless thou knowest the mystery, that if what 
            thou seekest thou findest not within thee, 
            then thou shalt never find it without thee. 
            For behold, She has been with thee from the 
            beginning, and She is that which is attained 
            at the end of desire. 
           
           
          * (Light charcoal and Take piece of bread in hand.  ) 
           
            now is the time to light your charcoal, and take the bread in hand. 
           
           
            This is the time of Lugh, the Shining One, the 
            Bright One, the Golden One, the Sacrificed 
            One.  He was conceived in the depths of 
            Winter, was Born in the Spring, Danced and 
            Loved in the Summer, and now, He Dies in the 
            Harvest so that we may Live through the long 
            Winter's Night. 
           
           
            Corn King, Sun King, Die and Be Reborn! 
           
            (Feel the death in the bread, the grains that 
            grew under the Sun, feeling the wind and the 
            rain on their husks, the sything of the grain 
            so that the bread may be made, the sacrifice 
            of Life so that Life could live.  ) 
           
            (Feel the Life in the bread, that which has 
            given up life, yet is filled with life, with 
            the sustanence that it provides, contemplate 
            hunger, and then the filling of that need. 
            See enough bread to feed the world., for the 
            God{dess} is not stingy, but looks after all 
            Her Children.  ) 
           
            (Holding the Bread in your hand, offer it up 
            for Blessings.  ) 
           
              &quot;Oh Mighty Mother of us all, bringer of all 
            fruitfulness, give us fruit and grain, flocks 
            and herds, and children to the tribe, that we 
            may mighty.  By the Rose of thy love, do thou 
            descend upon the body of thy children.&quot; 
           
            &quot;Behold, the Holly King is dead, he who is 
            also the Corn King.  He has embraced the Great 
            Mother, and died of his love, so has it been, 
            year by year, since time began.  But if the 


                                                                            2105

            Holly King is dead, he who is the God of the 
            Waning Year, all is dead; all that sleeps in 
            Her womb of Earth would sleep forever.  What 
            shall we do therefore, that the Holly King may 
            live again?&quot; 
           
            &quot;We Shall eat of the bread of Life.  Then 
            shall sleep lead on to rebirth.&quot; 
           
            (Tear off part of the Bread and offer it to the 
            Flame.  As it ignites and smokes, see the 
            spark of life that will be reborne in the womb 
            of the Earth Mother in the Winter.) 
           
            As the bread smokes, see life and death in the smoke, one lives on
          the 
            other... 
            and without both, we would not be. 
           
            &quot;Come back to us, Holly King, that the land may 
            be fruitful.&quot; 
           
                 I am the battle-waging spear; 
                 I am a salmon in the pool; 
                 I am a hill of poetry; 
                 I am a ruthless boar;
