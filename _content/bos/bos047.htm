<center><h1>A Healing Myth</h1><h4>By &quot;Nihasa&quot;</h4></center>
<table border>
<td>
This story can have a powerful healing effect when read out
loud (or recorded and then played) to someone suffering from
a phobia or other effect of childhood trauma. While names,
settings, and style can be varied to suit individual tastes,
the sequence which the apprentice describes, the sequence
the princess goes through, and the vagueness of the &quot;bad
thing&quot; descriptions should remain unchanged and no element
of the story should be left out.

<p>Once, in another time and another place, a kingdom of magic  
and beauty knew a time of peace. No armies threatened its  
borders, no bandits plundered its trade routes, no plagues 
sickened its people. Yet even in such peaceful times, bad 
things could happen: accidents, misunderstandings, even
good people doing bad things.</p>

<p>The third daughter of the king was a bright and cheerful  
sort. She wasn't the strongest or the prettiest of the  
royal princesses, but she did have the nicest wings of  
anyone her age. She loved to fly around the countryside  
and explore the groves and meadows she found...they were  
always full of surprises.</p>

<p>One day she found a particularly pretty grove, with a pond  
glistening in a little clearing in the middle. As she went  
in for a closer look, she saw images start to form. She saw  
her own reflection, and as she lightly touched the ground  
she saw that her reflection was watching reflections of her  
own...dim watery reflections from her past.</p>

<p>&quot;So you can see the pictures.&quot; The voice from among the  
trees made her jump. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; continued the young man  
as he stepped out from among the trees, &quot;nobody else can see  
the same images, Princess. It's part of the magic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How...?&quot; she asked, looking him up and down. He was a young  
man, no older than the princess herself, dressed in the  
rough tunic of a wizard's apprentice. &quot;Who are you? How did  
you know who I am, what I saw?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am apprenticed to the Court Wizard. Everybody knows who  
you are, Princess...and besides, I have seen you at the  
palace when I have been there with my master.&quot; He paused,  
glancing at the ground and lowering his voice. &quot;As to the  
images... well, at one time I had need of their magic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I entered the Wizard's service, I had a great and  
secret fear. Something...bad...happened to me when I was  
younger. It hurt to even think about, and after time I  
didn't think about it much. But ever since that time, I had  
lived with the fear. When my master learned of this, he  
taught me the magic of this pool and its stream.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The pool reflects images from your mind...scenes from your  
past, dreams of the future, even fantasies of the present.  
The stream flows like time itself, upstream into the past,  
and downstream into the future. If I followed the ritual he  
described, these magics could wash clean the fear.&quot;</p>

<p>She made a face. &quot;I suppose this ritual involves deep magics  
usable only by Wizards?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not really. All the magic is in the waters, and anyone can  
use the ritual. Even a lowly apprentice.&quot; He grinned. &quot;It's  
pretty simple. After he told me about it, he brought me here  
and then stood back by the trees. He said that he would  
answer any questions I had but otherwise I was on my own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I stood where I could see my reflection in the pool, and  
then thought about my fear. As I thought, my reflection  
watched a reflection of my thoughts...like a stage where  
dimly lit actors played out the scene against a colorless  
backdrop. I looked up and saw that I was still here, in the  
glade. I looked back at the water, holding on to a small  
part of the special feeling of fear it had given me. As I  
turned and looked back upstream, I saw more images...each  
earlier than the last. I relaxed and let the feeling guide  
me back to the earliest image. When I had that, I turned  
back to the pool and found my reflection watching the same  
colorless players in their dim reflection of the memory. As  
my reflection watched, the image went from a time shortly  
before the bad thing happened, through the whole thing, and  
on to a time when it was all over. When it passed the ending  
that way, it stopped...like a drawing. Then the drawing  
faded away, and I was just looking at my reflection. The  
Wizard had told me that if I stepped into that last part of  
the image, it would run very quickly backwards, with full  
color and sound and me living backwards through it all...all  
the way through to the part before the beginning. It sounded  
very strange. As I looked at my reflection again, it was  
watching the image go forward again in its dim, colorless  
way. When it reached the drawing at the end, I stepped into  
the image and was plunged into a world going backwards! It  
went clear through to before the beginning in less than a  
second, then stopped. Startled, I let the water carry me  
downstream, through all that had happened since, with the  
fear gone and the memory unable to hurt me. When I reached  
the here-and-now, I got out and just stood there, knowing  
that the fear would trouble me no more.&quot; He stopped, and  
suddenly seemed to remember where he was, and who he was  
talking to. &quot;That was over a year ago, and the fear is still  
gone. The Wizard says it is gone for good.&quot;</p>

<p>She thought for a moment. &quot;So all there is to this ritual is  
think of the problem until your reflection sees it, follow a  
part of the feeling upstream to my earliest memory of it,  
wait for my reflection to see it all the way through, step  
into the ending, and live it backwards quickly? What kind of  
magic is that?&quot;</p>

<p>He thought for a minute, shrugged, and said &quot;Effective? If  
you wish, I will withdraw to the trees while you try it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What makes you think that I <i>need</i> it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because the images only come to those who do.&quot; His voice  
faded to an embarrassed silence as he realized what he had  
said. &quot;I'll go now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, do.&quot; She said absently, already thinking. Then: &quot;But  
not too far, in case I need you.&quot; She was remembering an  
incident a few days back which had set off her special fear,  
and just as the apprentice had described, her reflection in  
the pool was watching a dim and watery scene of the memory.  
Startled, she looked up again. Yes, she was in the clearing,  
with the trees all around and the apprentice all but lost  
among the closer ones. She could still feel a part of that  
fear, so she kept that feeling while she looked back up  
stream at all the images from the past that the feeling had  
touched...until she found the earliest of them all. She  
brought that memory back to the pool and released it as her  
reflection started to watch it unfold in its dim and watery  
way. Her reflection seemed to have a life of its own as it  
watched the pale scene start before anything happened, run  
through the bad parts, and then pause at a time when it was  
all over. She watched her reflection shift as she prepared  
for what she would do. Her reflection settled as it watched  
the scene unfold again. The dim scene passed through the  
beginning, through the bad time and on past again. When it  
stopped, she jumped in to it. Suddenly, she was there again:  
back where and when it had happened. Everything was moving  
backwards, and in a flash she had lived backwards through it  
and past the beginning. Shocked, she let the water carry her  
down stream, forward through all the rest of her yesterdays  
without the bad times for company. When she got to today,  
she stood up. There she was...standing, dripping in a stream  
in the clearing. She looked around for the apprentice, half  
expecting him to be laughing at the soggy mess she must be.  
He was there, by the trees...not laughing, just smiling in  
an understanding way.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, they became friends. Although  
they went their separate ways...he, as wizard to one of the  
King's high lords and she as wife to a neighboring prince...  
they valued that friendship to the end of their days. And  
from that time on, neither was ever again troubled by their  
great fears.</p>
