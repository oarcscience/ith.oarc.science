                                    Elemental Cauldrons 

                Using a cauldron, symbol of inspiration and rebirth, has brought
          new dimensions  to both group and solitary work.  A cauldron decorates
          the  center of the Circle during Lesser Sabbats.  An air cauldron at a
          spring rite  creates a misty,  magical quality  for the ceremony.   In
          summer, the  cauldron  will flash  and  spark.   A  blue  flame  burns
          mysteriously  within the  Water cauldron  during the  autumn festival.
          Throughout  Yule, the  Earth  cauldron burns  steadfast and  constant.
          During moon  rites, when magick is  done, we write the  purpose of our
          working on flash papers and toss  them into the burning cauldron while
          chanting.
                A  working cauldron should be of cast iron, with a tight-fitting
          lid,  three sturdy legs,  and a strong  handle.  Season  your cauldron
          before using it for the first time.  Pour in generous helping  of salt
          and lighter fluid, slosh it  up to the rim  and wipe dry.  For  indoor
          use it  MUST have a  fireproof base  or your workings  will summon  up
          yellow-coated salamander spirits from the fire department.

          EARTH Cauldron

                Layer salt, wax shavings, three powered or ground herbs, fighter
          fluid and ivy leaves in the cauldron while focus and chanting.  Use  a
          candle to light  it.  When  the smoke starts  to roll, extinguish  the
          cauldron by putting the lid on.

          AIR Cauldron

                Using tongs, put a  chunk of dry ice is a small glass or ceramic
          bowl  and place the  bowl on  a cloth in  the bottom of  the cauldron.
          Allow the  cauldron to  smoke as  long as the  ice lasts.   The  mists
          create excellent images for scrying.

          FIRE Cauldron

                Cover theinside bottom with dirtor sand to dissipateheat.  Light
          incense  charcoal and  add either salt  petter for flame  and spark or
          flash powder for  a different  but spectacular effect.   To assist  in
          releasing or firing off peak energy, try using flash &quot;bombs&quot;.   Make a
          small pocket in a piece of flash paper, fill with flash powder and tie
          with  thread.  The  &quot;bomb&quot; should be  about the size  of your smallest
          fingernail.  The results  are spectacularly bright, so use  the powder
          sparingly.  Don't look directly at the flash as you drop the &quot;bomb&quot; in
          the cauldron.

          WATER Cauldron.

                                                                             420

                At least seven days before the ritual, place equal quantities of
          three appropriate herbs in a pint glass jar.  Fill the rest of the jar
          with Everclear  (200 proof  alcohol),  cap tightly,  and shake  gently
          while concentrating on the purpose of the ritual.   Add a chant if its
          feels right.   Let the jar rest  in a dark, warm spot  and shake twice
          daily,  charging with purpose.   Before the ritual,  place a fireproof
          ceramic or  glass bowl  in the  cauldron.  Pour  in the  herb mixture,
          being careful none spills into  the cauldron.  Light with a  candle to
          produce a beautiful blue flame.

                The  cauldron,   as  the  fifth   elemental  spirit,  symbolizes
          inspiration,  rebirth,  illumination and  rejuvenation.    Use a  Fire
          cauldron  with salt petter to cast a Circle.   Use the mists of an Air
          cauldron  for an initiation.   Burn away hate,  prejudice and negative
          self-images, with a Water cauldron.   The Earth cauldron is  ideal for
          indoor Beltane rites.
                Remember to  place a  burning cauldron on  a fireproof  surface.
          Practice safety when using  any volatile materials and you  will enjoy
          your cauldron for many rites.
