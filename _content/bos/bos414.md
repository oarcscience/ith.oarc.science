                                                   New Words & Old 

                  In the autumn of the lightnings, in the mighty-voic`ed throng 
                  In the twilight were the offerings, with both chants and   full-throat song: 
                        These the People, born to silence 
                        These the Seekers, born to sight 
                        These the Wanderers, born to roaming 
                        These frail Humans, born to night... 
                  In the winter's swirling blizzard, in the quaking of great   trees In the
                night-black child of charring, in the wavering,   fitful breeze: 
                        These the Wicca, seeking knowledge 
                        These the Shamen, knowing care 
                        These the Students, always reading 
                        These the Hopeful, who despair... 
                  In the spring-tide's joyous growing, in the flower and the leaf   In the summer's
                dearth and plenty, saving up to stoke Belief: 
                        Hear the Mother, gentle-voicings 
                        Hear the Father, rumbled whisper 
                        Hear the Children, gay and laughing 
                        Hear the Many -- sing your vesper... 
                  Now the Bard and Druid gather 
                  Now the Priestess calls afar 
                  Now the Time to Watch and Listen 
                  Now the Time to practice more! 
                           +*+*+ 
                                              Kihe Blackeagle 


                                                                                               1899
