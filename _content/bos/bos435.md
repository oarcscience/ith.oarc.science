                             ======RHYMING CHARGE OF THE GODDESS======

              I am the harmonious tune of the songbird
              And the laughter of a gleeful child.
              I am the bubbling sound of the running brook
              And the scent of the flowers wild.

              I am the floating leaf upon the breeze
              And the dancing fire in the forest glade.
              I am the sweet smell of rains upon the soil.
              And the rapture of passion when love is made.

              I am the germination of seed in the Spring
              And the ripening of wheat in the Sun.
              I am the peaceful depth of the twilight
              That soothes the soul when day is done.

              I am found in the twinkling of an aged eye...
              And found in the birth of a newborn pup...
              Yes...Birth and Growth and Death, am I
              I am the gracious Earth, on whom you sup.

              I am your sister, your mother, the wise one.
              I wrap you gently in the warmth of my love.
              That which your seek you shall find within:
              Not without...not below...not above!

              Remember always, my children, be reverent.
              Be gentle, loving and kind to each other
              And hold sacred the Earth and its creatures:
              For I am the Lady:  Creatrix and Mother!

                      -Kalioppe-
