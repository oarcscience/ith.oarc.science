# An Eclectic Circle Ceremony

#### Durwydd, 1989-90

  

### Preliminaries

#### WATER:

Blessings upon thee, O creature of water, I cast out from thee all
impurities and uncleanness of the spirits of phantasm, confusion or any
other influence not for the free will of all.

#### SALT:

Blessings be upon this creature of salt; let all malignity and hindrance
be cast forth thencefrom, and let all good enter therein. Wherefore I
bless thee and invoke thee, that thou mayest aid me.

#### MIXING:

I take this salt of the Earth,  
Blessed with the will of Fire;  
I take this water of spirit,  
Exorcised with mind of merit;  
I mix them with words of power,  
Dedicated to every Tower.

By the power of Moon and Sun,  
By the power of Spirit, Earth and Sea,  
God and Goddess are part of One,  
As I Will, so mote it be!

### Casting of the Circle

I conjure thee, O circle of power,  
As thou encircle every Tower.  
That thou beest a place of Truth, Joy and Love,  
Encircling Flight of Eagle, Hawk and Dove.

Mighty Aegis of the Lady and Lord,  
Rampart of thought, action and word.  
To work in Peace, Powerful and Free,  
Who walk between two worlds conjure thee;

A boundary to Protect, Concentrate and Contain,  
That Power raised here be not in vain.

Wherefore do I bless thee and consecrate thee, in the names of Cernunnos
and Aradia.

### Sealing of the Circle

With potion of earth and water, I seal the sacred circle,

Within the circle All wills be free,  
The circle is sealed, So Mote it Be!

### Setting the Watchtowers

Airy Lords of Spirit;  
Let your influence of Power,  
Aid our minds with merit!  
I do summon, stir and call you up to witness these rites and to guard
the circle.

Ye Lords of Southern Power  
Fiery Lords of Will.  
Pray do grace your Tower,  
Your Powers to fulfill!

the circle.

Ye Lords of the Watchtowers of the West,  
Watery Lords of Death and Initiation;  
I do summon, stir and call you up to witness these rites and to guard

Ye Northern Lords of the Earth,  
Though we be yet but Mortals;  
Bless our work with worth,  
Boreas, guardian of Northern portals.  
I do summon, stir and call you up to witness these rites and to guard
the Circle.

Goddess and God, I would know,  
As 'tis above, so 'tis below  
Blessings on this work, please bestow!

This be my will, true and free,  
I do so will, so mote it be.

### Invocation of the Elements

Air, Fire, Water, Earth,  
Elements of astral birth,  
I call you now; attend to me!  
In the Circle, rightly cast,  
Safe from curse or blast,  
I call you now, attend to me!

From cave and desert, sea and hill,  
By wand, blade and pentacle,  
I call you now, attend to me!  
This is my will, so mote it be!
