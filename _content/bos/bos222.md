                        A basic love spell.. (be careful how you use these) 

                Take three cords or strings of various, pleasing pastel colors-
               perhaps pink, red, and green- and braid them tightly together.
               Firmly tie a knot near one end of the braid, thinking of your need
               for love.

                Next, tie another knot, and another, until you have tied seven
               knots.  Wear or carry the cord with you until you find your love.

                After that, keep the cord in a safe place, or give to one of the
               elements- burn and scatter the ashes in the ocean or in a stream.


                                                                                 959
