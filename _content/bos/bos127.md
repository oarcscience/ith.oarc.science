                                    Dealing with psychic attack 
                                          Zhahai Stewart


         What to do if you think you are being attacked. 
          
          1 - Question if it is really either imagination, or coming from within
         yourself.  Something may be trying to get your attention, but it may not be
         external, and by focussing on an external "enemy" you may be missing the
         point. 
          
          2 - Check to see if you are yourself inadvertently sending something out;
         maybe someone is just reflecting some energy back!  Nothing is gained if you
         get into adversarial mode in that case.  Many people have been taught that
         reflecting is the proper response. 
          
          3 - Put up a grounding shield.  Ground it out, send it to the Mother who
         can recycle the energy.  Grounding is usually taught to every student. If you
         don't feel you can be a "conduit" safely, ground it by reflecting  it
         downward to the Earth; that is a big target and easy to hit.  By  grounding
         it out, you are protecting yourself, yet not being caught up in it. 
          
          What not to do. 
          
          1 - Figure out who is sending it and counter attack.  You might be wrong,
         and may be starting a feud.  You might be right, but they may not realize
         that they are "sending" so you may start a feud or cause unnecessary harm.
         Even if you are right, you are escalating a feud, of which we have too many.
         This is commonly discussed as a bad idea. 
          
          2 - Put up a reflective shield which will return the energy to the sender.
         This is commonly discussed as a good idea, but we disagree.  We think this is
         unwise. 
          
          For one thing, it is not necessary; if you can make an accurate return
         reflection, you can certainly reflect it to Earth instead (where it can be
         recycled).  There is no reason you should not be able to ground out more
         energy than you can accurately reflect to the sender, if viewed properly. 
          
          For another, your accuracy in returning it may be less than perfect.  You
         might hit close but not close enough; if you can't reflect it to earth, you
         are going to have trouble reflecting it to an unknown person. 
          
          Sometimes this is discussed as if once you return it, the sender will just
         stop; because they will awaken to what they are doing, or because the
         returning energy will be too much to handle. The thing which is seldom
         mentioned is that if the sender (assuming there is one) was consciously
         attacking, they will likely already be prepared with their own mirrors, etc. 
         Great, if we put near perfect mirrors at each end and pump in energy, maybe
         we can get a psychic laser effect; guess who is just on the other side of the
         mirrors to catch the intensified leakthru? 
          


                                                                                      565

          If they weren't aware of sending, they will probably just assume they are 
         being attacked and take countermeasures.  If they follow the 3 steps above,
         fine, nothing is damaged.  But many of them will immediately think they  have
         to put up a defensive mirror, or maybe worse (see below; they may decide to
         teach you a lesson for attacking them).  Few people naturally respond to
         perceived attacks positively (especially if they are in such a bad mood
         already as to be sending without even realizing it). 
          
          Another serious concern is getting drawn into a unacknowledged feud by your
          own weaknesses.  It is often agreed that one should reflect back exactly
         what is received, without adding anything of one's own.  But the same people
         who advocate that may use terms implying "returning it with enthusiasm".
         There appears to be an easily tapped source of self-righteousness in most
         people feeling attacked, and it is _very hard_ not to get drawn into
         imagining, at some level, the satisfying effects of the energy going back to
         the attacker; that draws one into a "counter-attack" even without realizing
         it.  Grounding it does not. 
          
          Watch for yourself when people are discussing "returning to sender"; see if
         there isn't very often a hidden desire for revenge or retribution lurking
         there grasping for their "control panel" - and deflecting their normal
         attempts at staying centered by claiming to do no more than is "justified".
         Justified is not the question; self knowledge and balance are. 
          
          There is another thread which shows up often in discussions like these; the
         need to "teach the sender a lesson".  In some cases, I have even heard this
         justified as "protecting the community".  This way lies many... ....PRINT D did
         the goddess give you an "agent of threefold return" marshall's badge, that
         exempts you from any consequences "because you are just an agent"?  That 
         hubris is gonna teach some hard lessons, but the self appointed marshall may
         be the major recipient.  It would be a little bit healthier to just shed the 
         self-righteousness and call it an ego driven feud.  "Teaching them a lesson"
         gets filed under the pitfalls of righteousness, the ways that one's own 
         weaknesses seduce one. 
          
          Also consider, what if despite your initial impression, the negative energy
         is really coming from inside, from part of you?  Are you going to be better
         off "reflecting it back" (maybe with additional conscious or  unconscious
         oomph) or grounding it?  "Gee, I returned it but good, and now  they have
         stepped it up; the sender really needs a lesson!".  That may be more true
         than you know, bucko. 
          
          Notice that nowhere do we say that one has no "right" to put up a
         reflective shield; of course one does, and is fully justified.  Also,
         possibly, unwise. There is a distinction between what one has a "right" to do
         in "self defense", and what is wise to get drawn into.  Reflecting it is
         neither necessary, nor likely to produce positive results, but if _that
         itself_ is the lesson to  be learned, what can I say?  Each chooses their own
         path, and that is as it should be.  At least if one has considered the above,
         one should know what they are stepping into. 
          


                                                                                      566
