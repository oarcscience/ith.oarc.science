              HPS  | Relax...  Let your body and mind be at ease... Breathe 
                   | gently; regularly... 
                   | This is the time of Inward turning, of saying goodbye to 
                   | our Dead. 
                   | We have descended into the night, and the veil between the
                   | worlds is at it's thinnest. 
                   | The Sun King has become the Lord of Shadows, sailing West:
                   | We follow Him into the dark. 
                   | Life declines; the season of barrenness is on us, yet we 
                   | give thanks for that which we have reaped and gathered. 
                   | We meet to turn the Wheel and weave the cord of life 
                   | that will sustain us through the dark. 
                   | I take these Creatures of Earth and Water, and do Cleanse
                   | and consecrate them to bring into this Circle,
                   | to do the Lady's Will. 
                   | I purify this sacred space in the Lady's Name. 

              HP   | I take these creatures of Air and Fire and do Cleanse and

              HPS  | I cast this Circle... 
                   | a glowing blue orb... 
                   | glowing, growing... 
                   | surrounding all of us... 
                   | surrounding us in protective blue-white light... 
                   | expanding to touch all of us... 
                   | connect us into the web... 
                   | a place that is not a place, a place which is all
                   | places...

                   | Hail Guardians of the Watchtowers of the West, Spirits of 
                   | Water...

                   | That we may be re-born with you at Beltaine 
                   | Empty us of fears so that we may be strong 
                   | Strong in the Goddess' light to do her work

                   | Red. Fire. 
                   | The heat of summer. 
                   | The passion of adolescence. 
                   | Feel the South. 

              HP   | (turning to HPS) 
                   | Blessed Be thy feet, that walk in the Way of the Wise 
                   | Blessed Be thy knees, that kneel at the sacred altar

                   | us to Death's Door and beyond. 
                   | Goddess of Life and Goddess of Death, Cerridwyn, I call
                   | you Home! 
                   | (kneeling) 

              Cerridwyn: (greets HP, looks upon him) 
                   | By the Flame that burneth bright O' Horned One! 
                   | We call thy name into the night, O' Ancient One!
                   | Thee we invoke, by the moon-lit sea, by the standing stone
                   | and the twisted tree. 
                   | Thee we invoke, where gather thine own, by the nameless 
                   | shrine forgotten and alone. 
                   | Come where the round of tdance is Trod. 
                   | Horn and Hoof of the Goatfoot God! 
                   | By moon-lit meadows on dusky hill, when the haunted wood
                   | is hushed and still. 



                                                                                2181

                   | Come to the charm of the chanted prayer. 
                   | As the moon bewitches the midnight air, evoke thy powers, 
                   | that potent bide. 
                   | In shining stream and the secret tide, in fiery flame by 
                   | starlight pale, in Shadowy host that rides the gale, and
                   | by the fern-brakes fairy-haunted of forest wild and woods 
                   | enchanted. 
                   | Come!  O' Come! 
                   | To the heart-beat's drum! 
                   | When the broad white moon is climbing slow. 
                   | Through the stars to the heaven's height. 
                   | We hear thy hoofs on the wind of night! 
                   | As black tree-branches shake and sigh, 
                   | By Joy and terror we know thee nigh, 
                   | We speak the spell thy power unlocks, 
                   | At Solstice, Sabbat, and Equinox. 
                   | Word of Virtue the veil to rend, 
                   | From Primal Dawn to the wide World's end, 
                   | Since time began, the blessings of Pan 
                   | Blessed be in strength and love, 
                   | Blessed be, wher'ere we rove, 
                   | Vision fade not from our eyes 
                   | Of the Pagan Paradise. 
                   | Past the gates of Death and Birth, 
                   | Our inheritance of Earth. 
                   | From our soul the song of Spring 
                   | Fade not in our wandering, 
                   | Our life is one, 
                   | By blackest night or the noonday Sun. 
                   | Eldest of Gods on thee we call, 
                   | Blessing be on thy Creatures all. 
                   | I call upon thee, O' Ancient Horned One 
                   | Who art the Comforter and the Consoler of Men 
                   | I call upon thee, O' Great God of the Witches. 
                   | Ruler of the Sabbat, Lord of the Wild Woods, 
                   | I call upon thee, for I am thy Lady.

                   | And join the Lady Cerridwin at this Holy Sabbat/Esbat. 
                   | I call thee by thy most ancient name Cernunnos. 
                   | Descend upon this thy Circle NOW! 
                   | We welcome thee Home! 
                   | We welcome thee, Cernunnos! 
                   
              Cernunnos: I am here. 
                   | My Children call, from woods and from stream    
                   | from fields fair and snow crested mountains. 
                   | Once more the Wheel of Life has turned, the Gods of Spring

                   | and Summer are gone.  Now's the time of the long night... 
                   | and my white cloak spreads forth upon the land. 
                   | Breath shoots steaming into the night, moonlight glints
                   | off shining horn. 
                   | Strength answers strength as I bugle my challenge... 
                   | Calling you to me I bring you nigh 
                   | Walk with me a while, 



                                                                                2182

              Cerridwyn: It is Samhain... 
                   | It is the year's ending. 
                   | The crops have all been gathered in,

                   | seed next year's crops. 
                   | It is Samhain.

                   | It is time to take new stock of ourselves 
                   | It is time to allow our roots to grow quietly, 
                   | deep and strong. 
                   | The year's ending. 
                   | The new year's beginning 
                   | signified in that ending.

                   | around you, 
                   | with point facing West, and the ties of the past year
                   | about your hands. 
                   | It is the great cold of the night, it is the dark.

                   | whole and red... 
                   | take it, and envision it as you slice it open through its 
                   | equator... 
                   | see the pentacle formed in the apple before you: 
                   |   Behold the fruit of Death

                   |  "This the circle of Rebirth.  
                   | Through you all passes out of 
                   | Life, 
                   | but through Me all may be born again.  Everything passes, 
                   | changes. 
                   | Seed becomes fruit; fruit becomes seed. 
                   | In birth, we die; on death, we feed.
                   | Know Me, and be free of all fear.  For My womb 
                   | is the Cauldron of Rebirth, 
                   | in Me, the Circle is ever Turning."

                   | My Lady, it's the time when we walk the land again 
                   | Our children call us, and the fields and forests grow 
                   | barren as the leaves dance their way to death.  Now 
                   | it's time for us to leave this space and walk the Circle 
                   | of Life and Death again.  Gracious Goddess, you who 
                   | the Stars shine for, You who I dance and Live for... 
                   | you who Bring us Life and Death and Life again... 
                   | I thank you for your presense here tonight... 
                   | so that once more we could dance together.. 
                   | As you depart this space, we will always remember 
                   | you, and the love that you have for us. 

              Cerridwyn: Hunter, you who trod the paths of the Wild and
                   | untamed, I thank you for your presence here tonight.
