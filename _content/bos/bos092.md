                                        What is Shamanism? 
                           Michelle Klein-Hass/SysOp, Shaman's Soup BBS 
               
              Pardon me for asking, but what is Shamanism?  That's one area of "the 
              occult" that I don't remember hearing about. 
               
              OK, I guess I'm the resident shamanism maven here, so I'll try to 
              define it.  Shamanism is the name (from the Tungus Shaman, meaning 
              miracle-worker) for any tradition of ecstatic worship of the Earth, 
              and the forces that reside and pervade Her.  Most traditions of 
              shamanism worship two deities, the God and the Goddess.  In the 
              European shamanic tradition, also known as Wicca, the God and Goddess 
              are most commonly known as The Lord and The Lady, or Great Mother and 
              the Lord of the Hunt. In the Yoruban tradition, they are known as Ogun
              and Yemaja. In the shamanic tradition of the Chiricahua Teneh 
              (Apache), they are known as Earth Mother and Sky Father, and also as 
              White Painted Woman and Killer of Enemies.  In other traditions, there
              are more deities worshipped, and in most of those named, there are 
              other lesser deities.  Some forms of shamanic tradition can be 
              classified as true polytheism, some, like the tradition of the 
              Australian Dreamtime, are truly pantheistic (the God-force is in all, 
              and all exists in the God-force, or as they put it, the Dreamtime) and
              at least in the tradition of the Yoruba (Nigerian African) and in most
              Native American traditions, these Gods and Goddesses are seen as 
              emanations from a Great Spirit.  In the Teneh tongue, this spirit is 
              known as Usen', Who is neither Male nor Female but encompasses both. 
              Joe Wilson describes the difference between the path of the Shaman and
              the path of the Priest this way: the Priest is the custodian of 
              tradition and rite, the Shaman is the one who journeys within and 
              experiences the God(esse)s directly. The path of the shaman is the 
              path of healing, direct involvement with ones Gods/Goddesses, and the 
              path of acquiring Power for The Good.  Modern Shamanism in America is 
              usually of two currents: Wiccan and Native.  

                   Wicca  is a reconstructed  system, which is  probably similar but
              not  identical  to the  pre-Christian  religion  of  the  Keltoi  (the
              Britons, the  Gallics, the Irish and Scottish Gael, the Picts, and the
              Cymri(Welsh)  It  used to  claim quite an  impressive history, but  is
              reliably  traceable  to people  like  Gerald Gardner,  who  designed a
              system of Wiccan practice from various sources, including, supposedly,
              a wealthy woman whose family had practiced witchcraft for generations.
              He obviously had a good grasp of some of the  Anthropological works on
              the subject, but liberally borrowed as well from Crowley, Freemasonry,
              and  *fin de  Siecle* occultism  like the  Order of  the Golden  Dawn.
              Artificial or authentic, it seems to still work.

                   Native shamanism works with either  traditions of a native people
              like the Native Americans  or the Yoruba tribe (present  in Santeria),
              or is a distillation of many practices, as is the  shamanism taught by
              Dr. Michael  Harner and  by Joseph  Wilson of Toteg  Tribe.   The true
              native traditions are dying  out quickly, and most native  Shamans are
              unwilling to transmit their  knowledge.  In some cases,  the knowledge
              has died out, and those descendants who remain and wish to embrace the
              Old Ways must  re-invent their  tradition.  My  teacher, Misha  Sacred
              Wolf  of  the  Naiche-Tosawi  band  of  the  Chiricahua,  is  in  that
              unenviable  position.  The Apache still exist, and they celebrate some
              of the old festivals for the benefit of tourists.  But much of the Old
              Knowledge died with the coming of the  white man, the reservation, and
              the  missionaries  that  considered  the  reservation  their  rightful
              "mission field". 
                   While it is true that many Native peoples are indignant about any
              non-Native  involvement in shamanism, and the new age movement is full
              to  the brim with  hucksters and shysters  who if you  give them money
              will teach you "how to become a Shaman", there are two non-Natives who
              seem to respect the Ways, and have attempted to present  the teachings
              of  Native shamanism  in a  respectful, reverential way.   One  is Dr.
              Michael Harner,  author of  "The Way of  the Shaman" (Bantam)  and his
              "core  shamanism"  system.   His approach  is  sometimes a  little too
              eclectic, with a  glaring lack  of the  ritual and  mythos that  makes
              shamanism so  powerful.  He  has reduced the shamanic  experience to a
              few major elements: The Lowerworld Journey, where the  shamanist comes
              face-to-  face with their "Power Animal", which is a representative of
              the person's basic  animal energy; The  Upperworld Journey, where  the
              person  journeys  to   contact  their  "Teacher  Within",   who  is  a
              representation of  the person's Higher Self;  the Middleworld Journey,
              where ordinary reality is seen through non-ordinary eyes; and  various
              techniques of healing, primarily the Jivaro "sucking doctor"technique.
              A  non-ordinary state  of  consciousness is  reached through  rhythmic
              drumming,  singing,  and visualization.    Despite  the very  clinical
              "self-help" aspect of Harner's work, it is very valuable.  If you live
              in the Los Angeles area,  you are quite fortunate in that  perhaps the
              most exciting work in  the eclectic shamanic  way is going on  through
              Toteg  Tribe, a  shamanic society  founded and  facilitated by  Joseph
              Wilson. Joseph  was a  participant in the  Neo-Pagan (Wiccan-shamanic)
              movement for  more than 25  years, and  is now trying  to forge  a new
              shamanic way  for ALL  people of the  Americas.  He  has built  on the
              techniques of Harner with insight from both traditional Native peoples
              of  this  land that  he  has studied  with  and entirely  new  ways of
              expression  that he and others  that work with  him have spontaneously
              come up with.  He  does not claim to teach traditional  shamanic ways,
              but his  work is quite valuable  and instead of looking  behind to the
              old days  of Tribal America,  is aimed  towards the  21st century  and
              beyond.  Again, I study with  a woman who is of the Chiricahua  Apache
              tradition,  but I  also find  Wilson's work  to  be exciting  and very
              important.   I hope this  cleared up a  few things...there's a  lot of
              good info in the file areas about shamanic practice. 
              Hi Dicho--this is finished (sigh of relief)
