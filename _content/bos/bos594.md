                                  Yule Ritual 
    YULE DIVINE PLAY - by Lady Allusha, Coven Tara, publiched in the
    Georgian Newsletter, December 1983

    Characters:  Narrator, Earth Goddess, Handmaidens, Sun God
    Props:  Yule Fire

    Narrator:  It has been a long cold winter.  Here, where the trees are
    all barren and the snow covers the ground the nights are dark and long.

    Earth Goddess enters, followed by her Handmaidens.  They all move slowly
    around towards the birthing spot.

    Narrator:  We see shadowy figures in the distance, moving slowly.  The
    delicate footprints lead into the deepest realms of the forest.  It is
    the Earth Goddess, pregnant with Life, followed by her Handmaidens.

    Earth Goddess stops.  Handmaidens gather before her and kneel.  Earth
    Goddess starts to make soft birthing sounds.

    Narrator:  Listen!  The Earth Goddess is about to give birth.   In the
    midst of deepest darkness, light shall be reborn.  Lend her your aid!

    Handmaidens start swaying gently, joining in the birthing sounds. 
    Narrator encourages all present to join in the birthing sounds.  The
    sounds get louder and louder until ...

    Narrator:  The Sun is Born!

    Sun God jumps out from hiding into the center.  He appears small and
    weak.

    Earth Goddess:  Go, my faithful Handmaidens, and build up the Yule fire.

    That the weak Sun God shall grow in warmth and strength by its flames.

    She collapses with a sigh.  Handmaidens build up the fire.  The Sun God
    slowly grows as the fire grows, until he stands tall with his arms
    outstretched.  He says, " I have returned"  Then he dances a little jig.
