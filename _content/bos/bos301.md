                                       The Rede of the Wicca 
                          (Being known as the Counsel of the Wise Ones:)

              Bide the Wiccan laws ye must
              in Perfect Love and Perfect Trust

              Live and let live
              Freely take and freely give

              Cast the circle thrice about
              To keep all evil spirits out

              To bind the spell every time
              Let the spell be spake in rhyme

              Soft of eye and light of touch
              Speak little, listen much

              Deosil go by the waxing moon
              Sing and dance the Wiccan rune

              Widdershins go when the moon doth wane
              And the werewolf howls by the dread wolfsbane

              When the Lady's moon is new
              Kiss thy hand to her times two

              When the moon rides at her peak
              Then your heart's desire seek

              Heed the northwind's mighty gale
              Lock the door and drop the sail

              When the wind comes from the south
              Love will kiss thee on the mouth

              When the wind blows from the east
              Expect the new and set the feast

              When the west wind blows o'er thee
              Departed spirits restless be

              Nine woods in the cauldron go
              Burn them fast and burn them slow

              Elder be ye Lady's tree
              Burn it not or cursed ye'll be

              When the wheel begins to turn
              Let the Beltain fires burn

              When the wheel has turned to Yule
              Light the log and let Pan rule

              Heed ye flower, bush and tree
              By the Lady, Blessed be

              Where the rippling waters go
              Cast a stone and truth ye'll know


                                               1511
              

                                       The Rede of the Wicca 
                          (Being known as the Counsel of the Wise Ones:)
                                  (continued from previous page)

              When ye have a need
              Hearken not to others' greed

              With the fool no season spend
              Nor be counted as his friend

              Merry meet and merry part
              Bright the cheeks and warm the heart

              Mind the Threefold Law ye should
              Three times bad and three times good

              When misfortune is enow
              Wear the blue star on thy brow

              True in love ever be
              Unless thy lover's false to thee

              Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill
              An' it harm none, do what ye will


                                               1512
