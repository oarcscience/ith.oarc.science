                         Spell for contacting a friend 
                                Rowan Moonstone 
    This spell should be used to cause someone with whom you have lost
    contact to contact you.  It is not manipulation so much as an astral
    call for contact when you have no other way to reach them that you know
    of.

    You will need:

    White candle annointed w/ sandalwood oil
    Sandalwood incense
    photo of the person
    small glass of water.
    salt

    Light the white candle and the incense.  Place the picture of the person
    on your altar.  Put 2 heaping tablespoons of salt in the palm of your
    right hand.  Let a small amount of salt trickle into the glass while
    making the sign of the equal armed cross of the elements.  Make this
    cross 3 times.  Say " Call me" three times as yo do this.  Then set the
    glass on the altar and say "Get in touch with me, please."  They
    should contact you by the time the water has evaporated from the glass.
