<center><h1>Wicca From My Point of View</h1><h4>by Lady Phoenix</h4></center>

<p>I can give you a brief overview of Wicca. (I don't speak for all 
Wiccans, only myself. There are some differences in the different 
Traditions.)</p>

<p>We believe that the ultimate godhead is unknowable. This doesn't
make for a good working relationship with the deity, however. So, we break
it down into a Goddess and a God. Different Wiccans worship different 
Gods/Goddesses. We can utilize *any* pantheon. Some worship Pan/Diana,
some Cernnunos/Aradia, Isis/Osiris, and many others.</p>

<p>We see our Goddess as being Triple Aspected -- Maiden, Mother and 
Crone, and she is reflected in the phases of the Moon -- Waxing, Full and 
Waning. We see the God as the Lord of Nature, and he is reflected in the 
seasonal changes. Like Jesus Christ, he dies for the land and the people,
and is reborn.</p>

<p>In general, we believe in reincarnation and karma. What you call 
Heaven, we call the Summerlands. We don't believe that Hell exists (or
Satan either.) We believe that there should be balance in all things --
when the balance is disturbed, that's when 'evil' occurs. Fire, for
example is not 'evil'. It could be considered such when it becomes out of
balance, as in a forest fire, or house fire. Controlled fire is a useful
tool. Anger is not 'evil', but when unbridled can't help but lead to
negative things. When properly expressed and balanced with constructive
working to correct that which invoked the anger -- it, too, can be a useful
tool.</p>

<p>We regard the Earth as our Mother and try to have respect for Her 
by not polluting her and try to live in harmony with Her and Her ways.</p>

<p>Women reflect the Goddess, Men reflect the God, so the Wicca have
a Priestess and Priest to 'run' the religious services. We call our
services circles.</p>

<p>This was sort of a &quot;Reader's Digest Condensed Version&quot; of Wicca.
If you have any questions or want more detail on any of this, please let me
know. Thank you for asking.</p>

<p>Blessed be &gt;&gt;Phoenix&lt;&lt;</p>
