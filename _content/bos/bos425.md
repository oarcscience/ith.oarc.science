                                                      ELEMENTS 

                Fire on Fire
                Light and Power, 
                Warmth and Energy
                They did generate.

                Earth joined them then
                To Life She gave Birth
                And solid Foundations built.

                Along came Water
                Some Channels to carve
                Through which all Energies flow.

                Around them All
                The Air did blow
                Winds of Thought and Deed
                intertwined.

                Power raised, Power spread
                Thus It Was
                So Mote It Be.       .....Alernon
