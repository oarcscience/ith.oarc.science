                               The Nemesis Conjuration 
      
     In this ritual the Greek Goddess Nemesis, a deity of fate and 
     vengeance, is seen in the role  of being the complementary opposite of ones
     ego  referring to  the inner  self as  the centre  of  both personalitties.
     Habits and actions  taken against ones real desires create  the opposite to
     the same degree and thereby form  an anti-personality of ones ego, which in
     this case is identified with the principle of Nemesis. 
      
     Disturbances on the  plane of reality due  to actions against  ones subcon-
     scious  desires  can  be eliminated  by  ritual  union  with this  personal
     demon-sister/brother  and enable  one to  reach ones  inner self,  which is
     defined as the mean value of both the personalities. 
      
     The effect of this ritual, if performed correctly, would by 
     definition be fatal.  Therefore the  operation is strictly  limited to  the
     part of the psyche which the magician wishes to explore. 
     A sigil representing this portion of the psyche is forcibly 
     activated during the ritual in order that the magician may 
     seek answers to his problems within the chosen area in the 
     personality. No specific wishes or desires can be used for this 
     purpose, only general ones. This is a necessary restriction to 
     avoid being overwhelmed by any unpleasant effects. The magician 
     should be aware of this when constructing the sigil. 
      
     Nemesis Conjuration: 
     1.Banishing. 
     2.The ritual is performed sitting on the ground in the posture 
       of the Rune PERDRO. The head may rest on the lower part of the 
       arms, and the face should be covered by the cowl of the robe. 
     3.Statementof intent: IT IS MY WILL TO TAKE A STEP TOWARDS THE 
       CENTRE OF MY SELF BY UNION WITH MY OPPOSITE THROUGH THIS SIGIL! 
     4.The incantation is given while visualising a winged figure of 
       opposite sex who approaches the magician. The figure wears the 
       chosen sigil on his/her breast and is both beautiful and 
       terrifying at the same time. 
     5.Incantation: 
       Come to me oh Nemesis, mighty, terrifying and beloved sister. 
       Come to me oh Nemesis, you, who are the goddess of my god, 
                              you, who are the demon of my demon. 
       Come to me oh Nemesis, you, who are the demon of my god, 
                              you, who are the goddess of my demon. 
       Come to me oh Nemesis, you, who are part of me which I am not, 
                              you, who are the counterbalance on the 
                              scales of my fate. 
       Come to me oh Nemesis, you, whose wings carry us to our 
                              mutual central Kia. 
       Come to me oh Nemesis, you, who are my ultimate fear, 
                              you, who are my ultimate desire. 
                              you, with whom to unite is the sigh of 
                              ecstacy and the silence of death. 
       Come to me oh Nemesis, for you are my path and I am our aim 
                              I call upon you to meet me in this sigil. 
       Come to me oh Nemesis  and guide me through this sigil to our 
                              mutual central Kia ! 

                                                                            1251

      
       Start hyperventilation during the reading out of the incantation. 
       The visualised figure with the sigil coming closer and closer to 
       finally melt into your own body. When this point is reached 
       shout out: 
       ZodACAM VaPAAHe ANANAEL ZoDA Ah! 
       (I move the wings of the secret wisdom within me!) 
      
     6.Banishing and/or laughter. 
      
     With fractalic greetings and laughter  * Fra.: Apfelmann * 

                                                                            1252
