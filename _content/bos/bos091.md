                                      CHURCH OF ALL WORLDS 
                                           BOX 1542 
                                         Ukiah, CA  95482 
               
                  Duplicate Membership Application (as presented in GREEN EGG Oimlec
              1989) Distributed Electronically to  the Pagan Community by  the Pagan
              Information Network in the general interest of all. 
               
               
                  In dedication tothe celebration of life in itsmany forms, I hereby
              declare my  commitment to a way  of life that is  ethical, benevolent,
              humanistic,  life-affirming,  ecstatic  and   ecologically  sane.    I
              subscribe  to   means  and  methods  that  are  creative  rather  than
              destructive, tolerant rather  than authoritarian,  gentle rather  than
              violent,  inclusive  rather  than  exclusive.    I  pledge  myself  to
              harmonious  eco-psychic awareness  with  the total  biosphere of  holy
              Mother Earth. 
               
              Like a redwood  tree, I would have  my roots deep in the  Earth and my
              branches reaching for the stars. 
               
              I acknowledge  my personal  responsibility for  myself,  to my  fellow
              humans,  and  to the  whole  of  Nature; and  I  recognize  this total
              responsibility,  in each of us, as  the source of our infinite freedom
              to become who we are and do what we will.  I dedicate myself to my own
              inner  growth and  development that  I may  be  of greater  service to
              myself  and  the  world around  me.    For these  reasons  I recognize
              Divinity both  within and without,  and I say  to myself and  others :
              THOU ART GODDESS; THOU ART GOD. 
               
              I wish  to unite with  others upon a  spiritual path that  encompasses
              both the  Heaven's and  the Earth,  and all  the  worlds between,  and
              hereby make  application to join the  membership of the Church  of All
              Worlds, in order that we may  learn together and teach each other ways
              to bring about these ends. 
               
              I  understand that this association  does not require  the severing of
              any other religious ties.
