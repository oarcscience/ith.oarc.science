                                     Santa 
                                 TANE JACKSON

    Christmas has two distinct themes running through it, as study of any
    collection of Christmas cards shows. One is the religious aspect,
    involving Wise  Men, angels, the Star and shepherds, and refers to
    the Gospel story of the birth of Christ. The other theme seems totally
    unrelated and depicts reindeer, stockings, a sleigh and, of course,
    Santa Claus.

    The two main Christmas personalities are Jesus and Santa, as most people
    will agree. Everyone brought up in a Christian country knows the
    significance of Jesus at this time but just who is Father Christmas and
    why should he become  part  of  a  religious festival?

        We must first look back at history and see why December became  such 
    an  important month in the religious calendar in the first place. The
    reason is, of course,  the  Winter  Solstice, December 21st, when the
    Sun appears to stop in the sky prior to beginning its journey back
    across the heavens.

        After the Solstice the days gradually  get  longer  and  the peoples
    of old considered this to be almost the birthday of the Sun. The peoples
    of the northern hemisphere were fond of having a festival in mid-winter,
    perhaps because they needed something to take their minds off the long,
    cold, dark days.

        In ancient Rome the feast of Saturnalia  was  held  between December
    17th and 23rd and gifts   were   exchanged.   The Romans also held the
    feast of Brumalia on the Solstice day itself and considered this to be
    the birthday of Mithra the unconquered Sun god. The Norsemen celebrated
    Yule at this time, to herald the return of the Sun.

        It is interesting to note that Christ is often known as the Light of
    the World, a title that continues this theme of darkness in retreat in
    the face of good.

        The Solstice has long been associated with the idea of people giving
    each other presents. Apart from giving gifts at Saturnalia the Romans
    also exchanged presents on the feast of the Kalends, which we call New
    Year's Day.  These customs prevailed all over the Roman Empire when
    Christianity was still a new religion.

        When Christianity spread to the northern lands they found the
    Norsemen worshipping Odin--who rode his chariot through the night sky at
    the time of the Winter Solstice, handing out gifts.

        Because the exchange of gifts was so linked in the pagan mind with
    these old festivals devout Christians were not supposed to exchange 
    gifts  at  this  time.  However,  gift-exchange  never died out on the
    European scene and finally the Church fathers had to do something about
    it.  They did not want to let people keep on believing that Odin or any
    other pagan deity had anything to do with gift-bringing so they looked
    around for an acceptable Christian figure to bring them instead. The
    person they chose  was  St  Nicholas,  the former Bishop of Myra in the
    4th century AD.

        Not much is actually known about St Nicholas, though many legends
    grew up around his kind ly figure. One thing that qualified him for the
    role of gift-bringer was his feast day being December 6th, a date
    sufficiently close to the Solstice for the two to be connected in the
    mass mind.

        St Nicholas was a useful saint and could even be described as
    all-purpose.  His responsibilities included the welfare of pawn-
    brokers, boatmen, parish clerks, dockers   and   barrel-makers among
    others. He was the patron saint of both Russia and Aberdeen.  The 
    best-known  story about him tells of his leaving three bags of gold on
    a poor man's windowsill as dowries for his three daughters. One version
    of this tale states that the gold was thrown through the window and
    landed in a stocking that had been hung up to dry, which perhaps
    explains our custom of the Christmas stocking.
