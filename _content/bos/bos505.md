                  CIRCLES                                                
                    -Gwen Zak               
                  (Tune: "Windmills")       
                                            
                                            
     In days gone by, when the world was much younger
     Men wondered at spring, born of winter's gold knife
     Wondered at the games of the moon and the sunlight,
     They saw there the Lady and Lord of all life.
                                            
     CHORUS:  And around and around and around turns the good earth   
              All things must change as the seasons go by,            
              We are the children of the Lord and the Lady,          
              Whose mysteries we know but we'll never know why.       
                                            
     In all lands the people were tied with the good earth
     Plowing and sowing as the seasons declared
     Waiting to reap of the rich golden harvest
     Knowing Her laugh in the joys that they shared.
                                            
     Through Flanders and Wales and the green land of Ireland
     In Kingdoms of England and Scotland and Spain
     Circles grew up all along the wild coastline
     And worked for the land with the sun and the rain.
                                            
     Circles for healing and working the weather
     Circles for knowing the moon and the sun
     Circles for thanking the Lord and the Lady
     Circles for dancing the dance never done
                                            
     And we who reach for the stars in the heavens
     Turning our eyes from the meadows and groves
     Still live in the love of the Lord and the Lady
     The greater the Circle the more the love grows
                                            
                            *               
                                            
                                            
                                            
                                            


                                                                                2290
