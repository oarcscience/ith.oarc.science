          CompuServe on-line Imbolc Ritual, 1990
           
          (Ladyhawk) 
          This is Imbolc...or Candlemas...or Brigit's day 
          This is the feast of the waxing light. 
          What was born at the Winter Solstice begins to manifest 
          The Lady, midwife to the infant year, 
          now sees the Child Sun grow strong 
          as the days grow visibly longer. 
          It is a time of beginnings, 
          when we select the seed we will later plant, 
          nurture, and eventually harvest. 
           
          After I do each invocation, I will pause and let each of you say
          a FEW words no more than 2 lines, please...to your particular
          deity 
           
          Right now, I'd like everyone to ground and center themselves... 
          in the way that is best for you. 
          As you do, see yourself bathed in a white light, cleansing you
          and your area. 
           
          Now, mentally turn to the East: 
          Powers of the East 
          We bid you come 
          To witness our rite 
          And protect us! 
           
          Now mentally turn to the South: 
          Powers of the South 
          We bid you come 
          To witness our rite 
          And protect us! 
           
          &lt;Now mentally turn to the West:&gt; 
          Powers of the West 
          We bid you come 
          To witness our rite 
          And protect us! 
           
          &lt;Now mentally turn to the North:&gt; 
          Powers of the North 
          We bid you come 
          To witness our rite 
          And protect us! 
           
          &lt;Back once more to the East and in your own way, salute the East
          again&gt; 
           
          Now, let us all link together 
          Feel the earth energy welling up from the bowels of the Earth,
          our Mother 
          Feel it rise to our feet and up through our bodies 
          White light energy 
          Feel it flow through us and link us, 


                                                                            2097

          one with the other 
          So finally we feel and see the circle of energy, 
          the circle of power 
          binding us together and setting us apart 
          In a space not of this time, but of all times 
          Not of these places, but all places! 
          Blessed Be! 
           
          Sun King! 
          Horned One of animals and wild places 
          Joyously we ask you come! 
          All the land is wrapped in the chill of winter 
          The trees are bare and 
          the air is cold. 
          Yet still our hearts are glad 
          For we know you have been reborn 
          And nurtured in your early days 
          By the gracious Mother Goddess, 
          Lady of all fertility. 
          We bid you welcome 
          And rejoice in your growing strength! 
          Hail Great God! 
          Hail and Welcome!     &lt;ga&gt; 
           
          (Jehana) Hail &amp; Welcome! 
           
          (Ocean Mist) u!/u 
           
          (Shadow Hawk) Hail Mother, from you the Sun once more does grow!

           
          (Gwynndon) Hail and Welcome! 
           
          (Shadowstar) Welcome, Lord of the Sun! 
           
          (Jehana) Brigid, Arianhrod, Cerridwyn, Herne... Welcome! 
           
          (Larne) Welcome Lord!  Share with us your warmth and light! 
           
          (Ocean Mist) Hail and welcome in your new light! 
           
          (Ladyhawk) 
          Great Goddess, Noble Lady! 
          Known to the Celts as Brigit, Bride, Cerridwen, and more 
          Goddess of Light 
          Keeper of the sacred wells! 
          We gather tonite to honor your 
          who has nurtured the Sun King. 
          As the spring lambs are born 
          and the ewes come to milk, 
          as we sense spring itself 
          so close 
          We bid you welcome as we 
          Clear out the old and make way for the new 
          Welcome Lady 


                                                                            2098

          Welcome and all Hail! 
           
          (Gwynndon) Bride is come! Bride is Welcome! 
           
          (Jehana) Welcome, bright lady, spark of inspiration! 
           
          (Rita) Welcome, Great Mother.  Welcome and grow strong, Young
          Lord. 
           
          (Shadowstar) Welcome, Lady of Light! 
           
          (Larne) Welcome Lady!  Nurture and help us as we grow! 
           
          (Shadow Hawk) Mother smile upon us and bring us Life, Son shine
          down upon us and bring us Light! 
           
           
          (Ocean Mist) Welcome goddess of light! 
           
          (Ladyhawk) 
          Now, let us each concentrate on that which we need to &quot;sweep out&quot;
          of our lives 
          Picture it as, with a new, clean broom, 
          you sweep it away 
          and it vanishes in the air. 
           
          And now, with ourselves cleansed, 
          let us meditate on that we might wish 
          to plant for this year... 
          the &quot;seed&quot; we will plant in the spring. 
          For, this is the time of chosing the seed 
          and preparing for the planting. 
          Gracious Lady! Help us chose wisely the seed! 
           
          and now, with our seed selected and held dearly in our hearts, 
          it is time to thank the Lady and the Lord. 
          O Sun King, Horned One! 
          We thank thee for thy presence 
          Surely we feel your growing strength 
          In our heart of hearts 
          and find joy in knowing 
          that as the sun grows, 
          so do you! 
          We thank thee for teaching us that 
          even in the depths of winter 
          Life grows! 
          Farewell, Lord, if you must go. 
          Though, gladly would we have you stay and 
          rejoice with us. 
          Hail, Sun King! 
           
          Gracious Lady, 
          We thank thee for thy guidance 
          in selecting our seed. 
          Truly will we hold it in our hearts 


                                                                            2099

          Till the time of planting. 
          We thank thee also 
          For teaching us the wisdom 
          of cleansing and letting go 
          of that which is no longer useful to us. 
          Thus do we heal of past hurts 
          and grow in strength, even as does our Lord. 
          We thank thee 
          and bid you farewell if you must go, 
          but gladly would we have you stay 
          and rejoice with us! 
          Hail, Gracious Lady! 
           
          And now, we will let our circle sink back into the Earth once
          again. 
          For all that comes of the Earth, must surely return to Her. 
          But even as the circle departs, 
          know that we are still bound 
          By our love of the Gods 
          and the Love between us. 
          Blessed Be! 
           
          (Shadow Hawk) Blessed Be 
           
          (Rita) Blessed Be! 
           
          (Ocean Mist) Blessed Be! 
           
          (Shadowstar) Blessed Be! 
           
          (Larne) Farewell Lord and Lady.  Depart our circle, but be always
          with us.  
                  Blessed Be! 
           
          (Jehana) Blessed Be!  So Mote it Be! 
           
          (Gwynndon) Blessed Be! 
           
          (Vkai) Blessed Be! 
           
          (Ladyhawk) 
          &lt;Now turn in your mind's eye once again to the East&gt; 
          Farewell, Powers of the East 
          We thank you for 
          Your attendence 
          and protection 
          Peace ever between thee and we! 
           
          &lt;Face South&gt; 
          Farewell Powers of the South 
          We thank you for your attendence 
          and protection 
          Peace ever between thee and we! 
           
          &lt;face West&gt; 


                                                                            2100

          Farewell Powers of the West 
          We thank you for your attendence 
          and protection 
          Peace ever between thee and we! 
           
          &lt;face North&gt; 
          Farewell Powers of the North 
          We thank you for your attendence 
          and protection 
          Peace ever between thee and we! 
           
          &lt;once more face East and mentally salute once again&gt; 
           
          The circle is open, but unbroken 
          Merry meet and merry part 
          and merry meet again! 
           
          (Shadow Hawk) Merry Meet and Merry Part, and Merry Meet Again! 
           
          (Ladyhawk) &lt;The Rite is ended&gt; 
           
          (Shadow Hawk) (passing food) 
           
          (Jehana) (Passing drink) 
           
          (Larne) I'll have some of those cakes!
