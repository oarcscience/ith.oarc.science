# Satanism vs. Wicca

#### by Diane Vera

Since your main worry seems to be public relations, here's how I would
make the distinction between Wicca and Satanism, in a way that is fair
to both sides and does not throw Satanists to the dogs:

I should mention, though, there's one possible problem with that last
sentence. Some feminist Wiccans might take offense at it, since it
implies the more radical forms of feminist Wicca are really more like
Satanism than like Wicca. Which in my opinion they are. If you've read
some of Mary Daly's books, you'll know what I mean.

I myself identify as a feminist Goddess-oriented neo-Pagan, as well as a
Satanist. Indeed, feminist Goddess religion is still my *primary*
religious identification. (Satanism is how I relate to "male" energy.) I
don't and never did call myself a feminist "Wiccan".

By the way, while I accept today's use of the word Wicca (with a capital
W) to refer to a specific European-based religion with a very specific
worldview, I do *not* accept the attempt by Wiccans to copyright the
words "witch" and "witchcraft". These words are generic terms, not the
property of any one religion. They refer to occult practices found in
many religions around the world. A Satanist has as much right to the
word "witch" as anyone else. (It so happens that *I* don't call myself a
"witch", but for a different reason: I think many "witches" are making
exaggerated claims to occult power, and I don't want to give the
appearance of making such an exaggerated claim.)
