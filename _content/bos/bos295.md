              Light white candles (1& 2)  light personality candle (3) light  purple
              candle (4), light incense (5).  Repeat the following invocation:

              "Hail Mother of the World!
              Nanna, Isis, Astarte, Selene, Holy Sin (pronounced Sheen).
              See me, look upon me
              See me, look upon me
              See me, look upon me
              Protect me and my people tonight.
              Send your white light around me.
              Send your protective light around ______________
              That they may be protected
              As they travel and as they dream.
              Send only good and lucid energies their way.
              Thank you.
              Thank you.
              Thank you.

              You can either  let the candles burn out by  themselves, or snuff them
              in reverse order and  let them burn a little each night  if the person
              will be on an extended trip.  On the  last night let them burn down on
              their own.   NEVER blow our or  pinch out the candles.   This destroys
              the luck.
