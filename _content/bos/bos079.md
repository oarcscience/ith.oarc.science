                                  A Pledge to Pagan Spirituality 



                        I am a Pagan andI dedicate Myself tochanneling the Spiritual
              Energy of my Inner Self to help and to heal myself and others.


                  *  I  know  that I  am a   part of  the Whole   of Nature.   May I
              grow  in understanding of  the Unity   of all  Nature.  May  I  always
              walk in Balance.

                  *  May I  always be  mindful of  the diversity  of  Nature as well
              as  its Unity and   may I   always be   tolerant of  those whose race,
              appearance,  sex, sexual  preference, culture,  and other  ways differ
              from my own.

                  *  May I  use the  Force(psychic  power) wisely  and  never  useit
              for aggression nor  for malevolent  purposes. May  I never  direct  it
              to curtail the free will of another.

                  *  May I  always be mindfulthat I create my own reality and that I
              have the power within me to create positivity in my life.

                  *  May I   always act   in   honorable  ways:  being  honest  with
              myself and  others, keeping   my  word  whenever  I   have given   it,
              fulfilling  all responsibilities and  commitments I  have taken  on to
              the best of my ability.

                  *  May I  always  remember   that whatever  is  sent  out   always
              returns magnified  to  the  sender.  May  the  Forces  of   Karma move
              swiftly   to remind me   of these   spiritual commitments when  I have
              begin to falter from them,  and may I use this Karmic feedback to help
              myself grow and be more attuned to my Inner Pagan Spirit.

                  *  May I always remain strong and committed to my Spiritual ideals
              in the face of  adversity and  negativity. May  the Force  of my Inner
              Spirit  ground out  all malevolence   directed my   way and  transform
              it  into positivity. May   my Inner  Light shine   so  strongly   that
              malevolent forces can not even approach my sphere of existence.

                  *  May I  always grow  in Inner  Wisdom & Understanding.  MayI see
              every  problem that   I face   as  an opportunity   to  develop myself
              spiritually in solving it.

                  *  May I always act out ofLove to all other beings on this  Planet
              -- to  other  humans,   to  plants,   to  animals,   to  minerals,  to
              elementals, to spirits, and to other entities.

                  * May I  always be  mindful that the  Goddess and God in all their
              forms dwell within  me and  that this   divinity is  reflected through
              my own Inner Self, my Pagan Spirit.

                  *  May I  always channel  Love and  Light from  my  being.  May my
              Inner  Spirit, rather    than  my ego  self,  guide  all my  thoughts,
              feelings, and actions.

                                    SO MOTE IT BE
