    ===================================================

    Preparation

    When you decide that you want to do a self-dedication,
    plan the date of the ritual at least a month in
    advance, choosing a suitable time, perhaps consulting
    astrological tables, or at least the phases of the
    moon. It is best done on a waxing or full moon.

    Start your preparation at the new moon. Make sure that
    you have a day off work for the initiation itself. You
    may already have decided on a magickal or witch name.
    If you haven't yet decided on your witch name, find
    one through meditation and pathworking in the daily
    ritual leading up to the rite of self-initiation.

    Begin preparing for the self-initiation by performing
    a daily ritual. Start by creating a sacred space.
    Purify the area with incense and sprinkling salt
    water. Visualize a sphere around yourself, and call on
    the powers of the four quarters, visualizing the
    elemental landscapes. (more...circle casting)

    Call on the Goddess and the God, by whatever names you
    prefer to call them. Declare to the Elements, the
    Goddess and the God that you are embarking on the path
    of dedication, and ask for their help in preparing
    you.

    Spend some time in meditation on the meaning of
    dedication, and opening yourself up for any messages
    from the Goddess and God. Thank and say farewell to
    the Goddess, God, and Elements, and close the circle.

    Closer to the time

    Try and spend time every day in the week leading up to
    the self-dedication rite working out your vows and
    meditating. Make sure that the vows you make are
    realistic! It is better to make less demanding vows
    than to make highly demanding vows and not live up to
    them.

    The Ritual

    Spend the day in quiet meditation and fasting. Drink
    only pure water, or if you really cannot do this,
    allow yourself a small quantity of apple or grape
    juice. Do not smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs! If
    you are on prescribed medication, consult your doctor.
    If the medication is short term, wait until you have
    finished the course of medication before doing the
    ritual.

    If possible, go to a sacred site or wild place and
    attune yourself with nature. Communicate with the
    nature spirits, and ask for their blessings.

    Think about the vows that you wish to make in your
    initiation. Think of a vow to yourself, one to the
    Goddess and God, and one to the Earth.

    Before you start the ritual, have a purification bath.
    You may put essential oils, herbs or sea salt in the
    bath. Whilst in the bath, meditate on purifying your
    aura. See your aura as grey and dirty, but gradually
    becoming lighter and cleaner, until it is brilliant.

    When you emerge from the bath, allow yourself to dry
    naturally. Do not use a hair dryer, or rub yourself
    with towels. Rub your entire body with oil. This may
    be olive oil, grapeseed oil, or other vegetable oil,
    scented with pure essential oils of your choice.
    Perform the ritual skyclad if possible.

    Have an altar set up, with an altar cloth on it, with
    a chalice of wine, a piece of bread or cake on a
    platter, a censer, two altar candles, some anointing
    oil, your athame or other tool, any ritual jewellery
    which will be put on at the end of the ritual to mark
    your dedication, and two small dishes containing sea
    salt and water (from a spring or sacred well if
    possible). You may also wish to have images or statues
    of the Goddess and God on the altar.

    Light the candles and the incense, and purify your
    ritual space. Hold your hands over the water dish and
    say:
    "I purify you, Oh water, in the blessed and mighty
    names of the Goddess and God",
    visualizing it glowing with white light. Do likewise
    with the salt, then tip some of the salt into the
    water, and mix it in with your forefinger.

    Sprinkle the salt water around your ritual space.
    Visualize a circle around you. (or cast a circle in
    your usual way) Call on the elements, then on the
    Goddess and God.

    Declare your intent, saying something like: "I
    (ordinary name) am prepared for dedication. I have
    followed the path and fulfilled my vows, and I now
    call upon the Goddess and the God to confer on me
    wisdom and integrity. I ask for the blessings of air,
    fire, water and earth".

    Spend some time in meditation, and controlled
    breathing to gather energy and achieve an altered
    state of consciousness. You may also wish to use a
    mantra or chant.

    Meditate for a while on finding the stillness inside
    yourself. When you are ready, stand before the altar,
    and anoint yourself first with oil, then with salt
    water and lastly wine, saying:
    "I am reborn into my true and magickal self, and I
    take on the name of (Witch name). I ask for the
    blessings of the Goddess and God on my endeavours, and
    I vow (make your vows)".

    When anointing yourself you may wish to anoint your
    chakras, or anoint yourself with a circle, pentagram,
    or personal symbol. It is good to write down your vows
    in your magickal diary, and sign the entry with your
    witch name.

    Present yourself to the quarters, stating that you are
    now dedicated to the solitary path. Consecrate your
    ritual jewellery with the four elements (incense,
    water, salt and candle flame), and anoint it with oil
    for spirit before putting it on.

    Consecrate your athame or other tool in the same
    manner, then hold it to your heart, feeling a link
    with it, and filling it with your energy. Say
    "I am a child of earth and starry heaven."

    Hold it up to the moon and stars, and ask for the
    blessings of the cosmos on it, then touch it to the
    ground, and ask for the blessings of mother earth.

    Lastly, consecrate the wine and cake by touching your
    athame to them, and channelling energy through it.
    Drink and eat, earthing yourself, then thank the
    Goddess, God and Elements, and close the circle.

    Remember: Write up your experiences in your magickal
    diary. Refrain from ritual for at least the next week,
    whilst you integrate the work.
