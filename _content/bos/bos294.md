                              Quarter Calls for The Dragon Tradition 


              EAST
              Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the East.  Your tongue is
              a sharp sword, cutting with the knowledge of the arcane.  Your spirit
              flows as graceful as a swift in flight.  Purify us with truth.
              Blessed Be.

              SOUTH
              Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the South, your breath is
              aflame with the  fires of  inspiration and  passion.   Your spirit  is
              searing and fervent.  Purify us with Love.  Blessed Be.

              WEST
              Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the West, your coils are the
              cleansing  healing waves that nurture  the soul.   Your spirit lunges,
              leaps  and splashes  like a Talbot  at play.   Purify  us with pulsing
              tides. Blessed Be.

              NORTH
              Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the North, your talons run
              like roots into the earth, giving you  infinite strength.  Your spirit
              is substantial,  hard and pure like  a clear crystal.   Purify us with
              persistant wisdom.  Blessed Be

              Each of  these Dragons has a  secret name that they  are also invoked-
              with.  A suggestion is that anyone using these invocations meditate to
              find an  appropriate name for each  Guardian and use it  along with or
              instead of the words "Mighty Dragon".

              Blessed Be.

              Enjoy!
