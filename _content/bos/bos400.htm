                                              Magickal Reveries 
                   Dedicated to Bill Heidrick 
                   ...who opened the door... 
                    
                    
                   I am as the Moon 
                   Our Light is ever changing 
                   Healing, gathering

                   As Capricorn begins the year darkly 
                   From the depths of light 
                   As the distant Sun 
                   Begins Her Northward Path 
                    
                   Saturn begins her leaden rainbow dance 
                   Giving form to time 
                   The Gates to Formlessness 
                   Make way for new forms 
                    
                   To emerge out of Saturnian Black 
                   Gates of Formlessness 
                   Are now used by wise souls 
                   Seeking Endlessness 
                    
                   As new forms dance in, wise souls may dance out 
                   To Eternity 
                   To explore timeless states 
                   And spaceless being 
                    
                   Saturn planet of time and timelessness 
                   Space and spacelessness 
                   Of limits and freedom 
                   Is our leaden key 
                    
                   To the golden place of immortality 
                   The Bliss of Saturn 
                   Is sweet, rich bliss, indeed 
                   In dark Capricorn 
                    
                   Agape is subtle wine, holy...pure 
                   While Chubby Eros 
                   Is a belching beer 
                   Good old, sad old lust 


                  
                 Is Thelema will with desire charged 
                   Is Thelema greed 
                   Drunk on yeasty-rich lust 
                   Rapine in her heart 
                   Or is Thelema subtle will, divine 
                   Heaven's Spirit scent 
                   Beyond sight, will or mind 
                   Like good Christian Faith 
                    
                   As Capricorn begins the year darkly 
                   From the depths of light 
                   As the distant Sun 
                   Begins Her Northward Path 
                    
                   Saturn begins her leaden rainbow dance 
                   Giving form to time 
                   The Gates to Formlessness 
                   Make way for new forms 
                    
                   To emerge out of Saturnian Black 
                   Gates of Formlessness 
                   Are now used by wise souls 
                   Seeking Endlessness 
                    
                   As new forms dance in, wise souls may dance out 
                   To Eternity 
                   To explore timeless states 
                   And spaceless being 
                    
                   Saturn planet of time and timelessness 
                   Space and spacelessness 
                   Of limits and freedom 
                   Is our leaden key 
                    
                   To the golden place of immortality 
                   The Bliss of Saturn 
                   Is sweet, rich bliss, indeed 
                   In dark Capricorn 
                    
                   Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                   Enfold me within 
                   Protect me, Mother, 
                   In my loneliness 
                    
                   Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                   Enfold me within 
                   Lead me to earthly love 
                   Lead me to my Self 
                    
                   Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                   Enfold me within 
                   Surround me with lovers 
                   Who heal me with love 


                  
                 Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                   Enfold me within 
                   Allow me loving friends 
                   Who heal me with love 
                   Isis spread your loving wings over me 
                   Enfold me within 
                   Lead me to earthly love 
                   Lead me to my Self 
                    
                   When bright spark was struck at dark equinox 
                   Hard clarity came 
                   As Sun struck Saturn 
                   In His Earthy home 
                    
                   The Astral Year begins in Saturn's house 
                   In chill mystery 
                   The leaden wheel begins 
                   Her twelve month circle 
                    
                   From Earth to Air to Water to Fire 
                   Then again begin 
                   Spinning wheel of magick 
                   Through time and through space 
                    
                   Twelve stations of the Elemental Cross 
                   Break the calender 
                   Wear tattered calender 
                   Like torn beggar's rags 
                    
                   Twelve mundane months slip over Heaven's Year 
                   Solstice to solstice 
                   Tearing the paper year 
                   With ancient power 
                    
                   Now the dark solstice has come and has gone 
                   Year is born anew 
                   New Year's day ahead 
                   Surly overlay 
                    
                   Vying with our more ancient starry year 
                   The New Roman Year 
                   Trys hard to hide the Gods 
                   Nor can it hide them 
                    
                   For their power is born ever anew 
                   Through the twelve stations 
                   And deep in each month 
                   Their Life births Magick 
                    
                   As Virgo dies the dark Crone encroaches 
                   Hard with Grey Power 
                   Harsh-shrivelled with Wisdom 
                   Of a long chaste life 


                  
                 What seems to be ugly, mean grows in strength 
                   Like a walnut shell 
                   Wrinkled shell, wrinkled nut 
                   Wrinkled wise, old brain 
                   Cruel Death mercifully releases Beauty 
                   Libra roses rise 
                   Gentle Autumn breezes 
                   Pink, red, soft petals 
                    
                   From peak to craggy peak the Horn'd One leaps 
                   Fire in his eyes 
                   Hard shouldered...white-hot chest 
                   Antlered man on high 
                    
                   Blue lightening flashes from his bright-hot thighs 
                   Swift knees crash through trees 
                   In the ancient forest 
                   Of my ancient mind 
                    
                   From those depths my ancient powers rise 
                   Fire in my eyes 
                   Soft heart hardens.  Wisdom 
                   Surges in my thighs 
                    
                   Knees and ankles loosen, muscles tighten 
                   I am the Horn'd One! 
                   I am He!  I am Free! 
                   Ancient One in me! 
                    
                   Affirmation:  I am Pan!  I am Cernunnos!  I am the Horn'd        One.   I am
            Shiva!  I am He!  I am Atman!  I am Free! 
                    
                    
                   Is Peace possible on Battlefield Earth 
                   No.  Not now, Kali 
                   Your Yuga demands War 
                   War is our teacher 
                    
                   Only through War can we learn to escape 
                   Your prison of Time 
                   The only Peace there is 
                   Is hidden within 
                    
                   Each individual heart.  Turn within 
                   Make that your War 
                   Exploit the Battlefield 
                   By turning away 
                    
                   That is War enough in Kali's prison 
                   Of Time and of Space 
                   Learn to reverse the Field 
                   And find your own Peace 
                    

                                                                                           1885
