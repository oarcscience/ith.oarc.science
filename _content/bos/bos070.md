                                            Sex & Magic 
                                          Fra.: Apfelmann

              In this article I would like to address the issue of sex and magic.
              I am quite aware of the fact that this is a loaded subject. It is
              one of the oldest disciplines in occultism and virtually every magic
              tradition applies it somewhere down the road. Yet it has always been
              regarded as the innermost secret discipline. Witches, Shamans,
              Runesters, Yogis and Magicians of all varieties work with it in one
              form or another.

              To build up, strengthen, direct and aim this powerful energy is an
              awesome magical tool, as anyone who has ever worked with it knows.
              Being limited in time and space, but having such a wonderful and
              eclectic medium to work with, I want to give you a few unbiased
              ideas on the subject.

              No discipline of magic has attracted as much mumbo jumbo or
              misinformation as sex magic does. Nothing stirs the mind more than
              the left and right of the so-called middle path quite as vividly.
              Nothing is more ancient, powerful and misunderstood as Sex magic.
              Yes, the market on Tantra is booming, as a visit to any occult book
              shop will show you. Yet well researched, practical introductions
              into sex magic are virtually non-existent. Male sexist tunnel vision
              abounds.

              One of the reasons being that the general approach towards sexuality
              and women is steeped in Judeo-Christian hang ups.
              The most common approach seems to be: "Just lay down and be the
              altar dear, you are going to love it." Even such revolutionaries as
              Aleister Crowley have done very little to improve this. Louis
              Culling even dares to state in his contemporary work (1971), that a
              frigid woman is more conductive to sex magic practice than a sensual
              or, mind you, sexually aggressive one. For this would surely disturb
              ones concentration on the Great Work.
              No wonder that there are few women attracted to these kinds of
              partners! You will always get what you want in magic and the
              so-called true will does reveal itself in strange ways. Doing some
              soul searching and clarifying your motives is quite effective.

              Now, regarding literature on this subject there is hope. My german
              friend Fra.: U.D. has written a comprehensive, pragmatic book on sex
              magic. It`s title is "Secrets of the German Sex Magicians"
              (Llewellyn) and he told me last weekend that it is available in the
              States right now. (I hope he will give me some extracts to post them
              here...) It beats everything that has ever been published on the
              subject. Get it!

                                                                                 231

              Now let me point out, one more time, that magic is a practical
              science. Merely reading about it or going to a workshop will not get
              you anywhere.
              The multitude of sexual expressions is just as great and manifold as
              human behavior in general. Here, like everywhere in Chaos Magic, it
              is useful to keep in mind that if it works for you, use it!
              Remember, the real sex magicians, male and female, have always known
              that and discarded social conditioning and taboos, right along with
              the do`s and don`ts of dogma.
              We do magic to liberate ourselves. So if it is possible for one
              thing to be sacred we logically conclude that everything else can be
              sacred too.

              Auto-, Hetero- and Homosexual expressions are equally valid in
              sex magic. It is more about expanding ones horizons that about
              finding a certain "right" way, partner or ritual to do it. The Chaos
              Magical paradigm kicks right in: Nothing is True, and Everything is
              Permitted!

              The next issue I want to address is the Auto-erotic practice. So let
              me state this loud and clear: Without auto erotic practice it is
              impossible to achieve anything in Sex magic!
              Auto-eroticism is of central importance because it is the ideal
              practice and playground. It constitutes a powerful technique in
              itself, and it makes us independent of partners. Especially in the
              beginning it is much easier to explore, prolong and amplify orgasmic
              trance states. For this very same reason it is possible to do
              effective sex magic with a partner who knows nothing about it but
              working with a partner who is equally trained in this art is ever so
              much more effective. Most amateurs believe that sexual magic is
              something that solely happens between partners in a ritual, but in
              reality the vast majority of sex magical arts are performed
              auto-erotically.

              Regarding the physical aspects of the sexual magical training first
              thing to consider is that your body is really _your temple_. And for
              it to be your ultimate tool and asset it has to be in peak
              condition. Physical and mental dependencies, be it alcohol,
              stimulants or even tobacco, will interfere with your ability to
              develop and direct this tool. I do not want to project a moral
              attitude on this, or any other subject, but mind, spirit and body
              are deeply intertwined. And the more you alter your mind from the
              outside by using drugs of any sort, the harder it gets to focus your
              will and physical reaction. If you are in a frizzy condition, you
              will get frizzy results! Here, as in all magic, the borders are
              fluid. A good training in practical magic will greatly enhance your
              sexual magic and vice versa.












                             Last amended June 11, 1989  --  Page NEXTRECORD 


                                                                                 232

              A lot of physical exercises in sex magic derive from Tantra Yoga.
              The only point of disagreement appears to be the way of using the
              orgasm. In particular, the "traditional" Tantra authors seem to cling
              to the idea that there is only a limited amount of sperm available
              to men. Therefore this precious substance is carefully guarded, held
              back and reassimilated when spent. Western magic does not agree
              with this belief. Its approach is rather like: the more you spend -
              the more you get! This applies to male magicians, women have always
              been pretty much inexhaustible in their orgasmic capacity. What
              joins both is that the intent in Sex magic is much more result
              oriented and concrete than in Tantra, where it is mainly
              transcendental.

              The longing for transcendence seems to be inherently natural in
              human behavior. Yet being western magicians living in the nineties
              we know that we have to handle the "real world", our physical
              reality first, and then we can move on to the loftier goals.

              A good manual for your physical preparation and training is
              "Stalking the Wild Orgasm" by Christopher Scott Kilham. Hie work not
              only includes some excellent yoga exercises, but also gives you some
              great clues regarding nutrition and aphrodisiacs.
              When you get going in this direction you will find that it soon
              penetrates into many other areas of your magical work. You will be
              in better physical shape, more relaxed, focused and grounded. Magic
              is a gut level art. We have to remove it from the intellectual
              stuff. Trust your own experiences. Strive to conduct your magic work
              from this part of your body where all magic originates - your loins.
              Have fun!

              With fractalic greetings and laughter  * Fra.: Apfelmann *
