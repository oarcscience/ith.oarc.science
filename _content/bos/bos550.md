                              IMBOLG RITUAL

    Two women are selected to represent the Maiden and the Crone. 
    the Priestess will represent the Mother.

    The members of the group should bring with them the candles which
    they will use for the year for blessing.

    The altar is at the Northeast and is covered with a white cloth.
    Evergreens are used as decoration.  A basket filled with tiny
    bundles of straw or wheat rests on the altar [there should be one
    bundle for every person participating in the ritual], as well as
    two (2) white candles.  A black ribbon at least twelve (12)
    inches in length is placed in the basket.  A single white flower
    tied with a white ribbon (to symbolize Bride) and the wand rest
    together in front of the altar.  Four (4) white candles stand
    between the quarter candles.  The cauldron is placed at the
    South, and a white candle is situated inside.  A dark colored
    scarf or shawl (for the Crone) and a bouquet of flowers (for the
    Maiden) are on the altar, as well as a single white taper (for
    the Mother).

    Full Circle is cast.

    The two women prepare "Bride's Bed."  The MAIDEN and the CRONE
    pick up the flower and the wand respectively, and take them to
    the center of the Circle.  They place the flower and the wand
    side by side in the center of the Circle, with the heads toward
    the altar.  They place the altar candles on either side of the
    "bed" and light the candles.

    The two women and the Priestess stand around the bed and say
    together three times:

                   The Maiden comes to bring us light!
                   The Winter dies, and all is bright!
                   The frozen ground shall disappear -
                And all shall sprout, for Spring is near!
                                    

    The Priestess now summons the two women, and the three of them
    stand in front of the altar, assuming their Triple-Goddess roles.
    The MAIDEN kisses the Priestess (MOTHER) on both cheeks and hands
    her a white candle.  The CRONE lights the MOTHER's taper.  The
    CRONE stands to her left.  The MAIDEN drapes the shawl over the
    CRONE'S head and shoulders.  The MAID stands to the MOTHER'S
    right and picks up the bouquet of flowers.  The PRIESTESS says:

                     Behold the three-fold Goddess;
                       Maiden, Mother, and Crone;
                      She is one - yet She is three
                           Together and Alone
                    Summer comes not - without Spring
                 Without Summer, comes no Winter chill;
                  Without the Winter, Spring isn't born
                   The Three, life's cycles, fulfill!

    The Charge of the Goddess is then recited.  After the recitation
    2421

    is finished the Priestess says:

                      Now let us celebrate Imbolc!

    The MAIDEN picks up the besom and makes her way SLOWLY deosil
    around the inside edges Circle, ritually sweeping it clear of all
    that which is old, useless and unnecessary.  MOTHER and CRONE
    walk behind her in stately procession.  While sweeping, the MAID
    says:

                    With this besom filled with power
                       Sweep away the old and sour
                      Sweep away the chill of death
                  As Winter draws its last cold breath
                        Round, round, round about
                     Sweep the old and useless out!

    The Maiden replaces the besom and the women resume their places
    in front of the altar.  The MAIDEN picks up the basket of straw
    bundles and presents each member of the group with one.  The
    CRONE goes to the South, kneels before the cauldron and lights
    the candle inside.  She explains to the group that the bundles of
    straw which they have been given are symbolic of Winter and
    Death, but also that any negativity with which they are charged
    will be burned along with it.  A few moments of silence are
    allowed so that each person may charge their bundle with their
    own negative thoughts, habits and shortcomings.  The CRONE then
    collects the bundles, walking widdershins.  She then ties the
    bundles together with the black ribbon, lights the "community
    straw man" and places him in the cauldron to burn, saying:

                        Thus we melt the Winter!
                     And warm the breath of Spring!
                      We bid adieu to what is dead,
                      And greet each living thing.
                         Thus we banish Winter!
                         Thus we welcome Spring!

    The Rite of Cakes and Wine is appropriate at this time.  All
    members have libation, sit and relax and visit amongst
    themselves.

    When libation is finished, the MAIDEN collects candles from the
    coveners to be blessed for use during the coming year, placing
    them in a basket.  The basket is placed on the altar.  The
    PRIESTESS says:

                 I bless thee creatures of wax and light
                       Casting out all negativity
                   Serve your purpose, flaming bright
                    Infused with magic, you shall be

                    Instruments of light and strength
                     Wick and wax though you may be
                    I give you life of needed length
                          To aid in creativity!

            In the Names of the Lord and Lady, so mote it be!
    2422
                                  
    The candles are then redistributed to the coven members.  The
    Priestess says:

    As we close this celebration of Imbolg, let each of us find joy
    in the power of the returning Sun!  As each new day dawns and the
    light of day becomes brighter and stronger, remember that your
    inner light should burn as brightly.  Feel the changes in the
    earth around you, as the chill of Winter recedes and all sprouts
    in the greeness of fresh, new life.  Remember the wonder you felt
    as you awakened from Maidenhood to Womanhood - from Boyhood to
    Manhood.  Relive the joy of that awakening and heal any emotional
    scars you may have!  Breathe deeply of the harmony of the Earth's
    new life and and rejoice in your own!

    Dearest Bride, Maiden of all that is fresh and new, we warmly
    thank you for attending our Rite of Imbolc.  As this Circle is
    dissolved, we ask that you guide us in our new beginnings and
    inspire us with the fresh creativity that you bring to all life.

    Routine dissolution.

    Outdoor libation to the Lord and Lady.
