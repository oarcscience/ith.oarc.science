    How to find a Coven or Group

    If you are looking for a group then going out and
    meeting people and talking, asking questions and
    showing your intent of finding a group are the most
    important steps.

    If you stay at home and never mingle with other people
    then don't expect anything to happen. This is not a
    'spoonfed' path to walk, there is a lot of serious
    work involved and when you do find a group,the work
    doesn't stop.

    Joining a Coven means giving up a lot of free time,
    subsituting social time for Coven time and spending a
    lot of time studying and experiencing... So which ever
    path you follow, and which ever type of group you are
    seeking - make an effort and be patient.

    In big cities such as the one we live in, London (UK)
    there is no reason to say 'But there is nothing to go
    to'. There are online organisations such as WWL who
    keep their members informed of social events,
    workshops, training groups, conferences and open
    rituals. The WWL also organise events just for their
    members, so that you can meet the faces behind the
    names.  To find out more about WWL visit:
    https://www.avalonia.co.uk.

    The Witches Voice - https://www.witchvox.com is another
    great resource.  You can find contacts with similar
    interests to yourself to correspond with, but most
    importantly they list all the major events,
    conferences and festivals organised by Pagans from all
    over the world.  They also list smaller events, such
    as pub moots and workshops.

    In parts of the world it is not that easy, and you
    might have to travel to attend conferences or
    workshops. This might seem like a lot of work just to
    meet other people, but if you are serious then travel
    should not deter you from your path.

    When you do get the oppurtunity to meet other Pagans
    make an effort to ask around about open groups and
    other events. As the organisers of the event if they
    know of groups which might be taking on new trainees.

    It is important to note that even in big cities such
    as London there are very few new groups forming and
    the groups in existance might only take on a trainee
    every few years. Those who do might expect to
    interview you to see if you will fit in with the rest
    of their group. If this happens take the oppurtunity
    to interview them too! Be honest with them, but make
    sure that their answers also satisfy you. Ask what
    they will be expecting from you and what training they
    will be providing you with.

    Unfortunately there are still some dubious groups
    using the name of Wicca to cover other activities. Do
    not just join a group because they happen to be the
    first one which approaches you!

    Remember:

    You should feel comfortable with your HPS & HP;
    Sex should not be expected in return for training, nor
    should it be part of your initiation;
    You should not be expected to contribute large sums of
    money in return for training - although you should
    expect to contribute towards temple expenses;
    Confidentiality is VERY important in Wiccan groups;
    Expect a lot of hard work!
    Finally you should enjoy being part of the group you
    join!
