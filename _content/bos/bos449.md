               Ok, you all will need bread, charcoal, a cauldron/braiser of some
              kind... 
               that you can ignite the charcoal in. 
               
               
               Does everyone know what Lammas is all about? 
               
               Ok, Lammas is a ritual dedicated to the Sun God, or the Corn God 
               Or a variety of other Gods that are known as sacrificial gods 
               called because the ancients believed that the sun at it's highest 
              point (middle of summer) died, and that the essense went into the 
              food to sustain life during the long cold winter ahead. This is the 
              time of the Corn King, as was said, the first of the Harvest times 
               when the first crops were brought in. 
               
               ok, then, we begin...

              * (Visualize a cloud of incense falling across 
                the world, cleansing and purifying, and saying,)

                "By the Creatures of Water and Earth I cleanse thee." 
               
               
              * (Everyone visualize and connect with the south, 
                the element of Fire.) 
               
                Ye Guardians of the Watchtowers of the South, 
                ye Powers of Fire; Spirits of Illumination and 
                Desire, I do summon, stir, and call you up, to 
                witness our rites and to guard the Circle.

                ye Powers of Water; Spirits of Death and 
                Initiation, I do Summon, stir, and call upon 
                you to Witness our Rites and to guard the 
                Circle. 
               
               
                (Connect with the North and the spirit of Earth,)

                ye Powers of Earth, Keepers of the Northern 
                Portals, Spirits of Mountain and Plains, I do 
                summon, stir, and call upon you to witness our 
                Rites and to Guard the Circle. 
               
               
                (Connect with the East and the spirit of Air, ) 
               
                Ye Guardians of the Watchtowers of the East, 
                ye Powers of Air; Spirits of Clear Will and 
                Knowledge, I do summon, stir, and call you up, 
                to witness our rites and to guard the Circle. 
               
               
                (Visualize the Earth Herself illuminated in 
                a Circle of silver Light.  ) 
               



                                                                                2103

                The Circle is cast, we are between the 
                worlds, beyond the boundaries of time, where 
                Night and Day Birth and Death, Joy and Sorrow, 
                meet as one. 
               
               
              * Listen to the words of the Great Mother, she 
                whom of old was also called among men Artemis, 
                Astarte, Athena, Dione, Melusine, Aphrodite, 
                Cerridwen, Dana, Arianrhod, Isis, Brid, and by 
                many other names. 
               
                Whenever you have need of any thing, once in 
                the month, and better it be when the Moon is 
                full, then shall ye assemble in some secret 
                place and adore the spirit of Her, who is 
                Queen of all witches.  There shall ye 
                assemble, ye who are fain to learn all 
                sorcery, yet have not won its deepest secrets, 
                to these will She teach things that are yet 
                unknown.  And ye shall be free from slavery, 
                and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall 
                be naked in your rites, and ye shall dance, 
                sing, feast, make music and love, all in Her 
                praise.  For Her's is the secret door that 
                opens upon the Land of Youth, and Her's is the 
                cup of the wine of life, and the Cauldron of 
                Cerridwen, which is the Holy Grail of 
                Immortality.  She is the Gracious Goddess, who 
                gives the gift of Joy unto the hearts of Man. 
                Upon Earth, She gives knowledge of the spirit 
                eternal, and beyond death, She gives peace, 
                and freedom, and reunion with those who have 
                gone before.  Nor does She demand sacrifice, 
                for behold, She is the Mother of all living, 
                and her Love is poured out upon the Earth. 
                Hear ye the words of the Star Goddess, she in 
                the dust of whose feet are the hosts of 
                Heaven, and whose body encircles the 
                Universe. 
               
                She who is the beauty of the green Earth, and 
                the white Moon among the stars, and the 
                mystery of the waters, and the desire of the 
                hearts of man, calls unto thy soul.  Arise, 
                and come unto Her.  For She is the soul of 
                Nature, who gives life to the universe.  From 
                Her all things proceed, and unto Her all 
                things must return, and before Her face, 
                beloved of Gods and of men, let thine 
                innermost divine self be enfolded in the 
                rapture of the infinite.  Let Her worship be 
                within the heart that rejoiceth, for behold, 
                all act of love and pleasure are Her rituals. 
                And therefore let there be beauty and 



                                                                                2104

                strength, power and compassion, honor and 
                humility, mirth and reverence within you.  And 
                thou who thinkest to seek for Her, know thy 
                seeking and yearning shall avail thee not, 
                unless thou knowest the mystery, that if what 
                thou seekest thou findest not within thee, 
                then thou shalt never find it without thee. 
                For behold, She has been with thee from the 
                beginning, and She is that which is attained 
                at the end of desire. 
               
               
              * (Light charcoal and Take piece of bread in hand.  ) 
               
                now is the time to light your charcoal, and take the bread in hand. 
               
               
                This is the time of Lugh, the Shining One, the 
                Bright One, the Golden One, the Sacrificed 
                One.  He was conceived in the depths of 
                Winter, was Born in the Spring, Danced and 
                Loved in the Summer, and now, He Dies in the 
                Harvest so that we may Live through the long 
                Winter's Night. 
               
               
                Corn King, Sun King, Die and Be Reborn! 
               
                (Feel the death in the bread, the grains that 
                grew under the Sun, feeling the wind and the 
                rain on their husks, the sything of the grain 
                so that the bread may be made, the sacrifice 
                of Life so that Life could live.  ) 
               
                (Feel the Life in the bread, that which has 
                given up life, yet is filled with life, with 
                the sustanence that it provides, contemplate 
                hunger, and then the filling of that need. 
                See enough bread to feed the world., for the 
                God{dess} is not stingy, but looks after all 
                Her Children.  ) 
               
                (Holding the Bread in your hand, offer it up 
                for Blessings.  )

                fruitfulness, give us fruit and grain, flocks 
                and herds, and children to the tribe, that we 
                may mighty.  By the Rose of thy love, do thou 
                descend upon the body of thy children." 
               
                "Behold, the Holly King is dead, he who is 
                also the Corn King.  He has embraced the Great 
                Mother, and died of his love, so has it been, 
                year by year, since time began.  But if the

                Waning Year, all is dead; all that sleeps in 
                Her womb of Earth would sleep forever.  What 
                shall we do therefore, that the Holly King may 
                live again?" 
               
                "We Shall eat of the bread of Life.  Then 
                shall sleep lead on to rebirth."

                of the Earth Mother in the Winter.)
