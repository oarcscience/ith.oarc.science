                      CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE
           (c) copyright 1984, 1992 W. J. Bethancourt III 
           recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE, WTP-0002
           tune: &quot;Same Old Man/Leatherwing Bat&quot; (Trad. Appalachian)
                                        
        Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand
        Once I talked to a great Grey Man
        Spun three times and said with a sigh
        Hadn't been for the Runes had His other eye!
                                        
Chorus: Hi diddle i diddle i day                  
        Hi diddle i diddle i diddle ay            
        Hi di diddle i diddle i day               
        Fol the dink a dum diddle do di day                                   
                                                                              
 Hi said the Lady, dressed in green       Came the Stag from oaken wood       
 Prettiest thing I've ever seen           Saw the Lady where She stood        
 She went down underneath the hill        By the fire burning bright          
 And came back out of Her own free will   Came to know His heart's delight!   
                                                                              
 Brian Boru, on Irish ground               Hail to the Lady, One in Three     
 Walked three times the Island round       We welcome You and honour Thee     
 Norsemen came lookin for a fight          As You light and guard the night   
 just another Irish Saturday night!        Honour now our sacred rite!        
                                                                        
 Hi said Lugh on the banquet night           Hi said the Lady dressed in white
 A poet and a player and a good wheelwright  Sang the Day and sang the Night 
 A harper and a warrior and none the least:  Sang the Land and sang the Sea  
 A Druid and he got in to the Feast!         Sang the Song, and then sang me!
                                                                           
 Harold Haardrada's face was red!      Hail to the Lord at the Lady's side 
 Came to Britain and he wound up dead  Master of the Hunt, in the day You ride
 Stamford Bridge is where he's found   Fire burn and fire bright          
 Got six feet of English ground        Honour now our sacred rite!        
                                                                          
 The Legion with its Eagles bright      The Circle forms, the Circle flows
 Marched into the Pictish night         The Circle goes where no man knows
 Met them there upon the sand            Hail to the Lady, one in three:  
 Gave 'em up to the Wicker Man!          Present is past and past is me!  
                                                                          
 Eight-legged steed and hound of Hel    By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound
 The One-Eyed Man, he loves ya well     Blessed Be: the Day I've found    
 Fire burn and fire spark               Hail to the Lady, one in Three    
 Are you then feared of the dark?       Present is Past and Past is WE    
                                                                          
 Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight    Fire and Water, Air and Earth    
 all thru the day, all thru the night    The Cauldron calls for our rebirth 
 Hail to the Lady, one in Three          Hail to the Lady, three times three
 Present is past and past is Thee!       The Circle's cast; so mote it be! 
                                                                          
 Salt and oil and mirror bright        From East and South and West and North  
 Fire and fleet and candlelight        Call the Powers to come forth!     
 By fin and feather, leaf and tree,    Hail to the Lady, three times three,
 Fill the Cup and Blessed Be!          The Circle's cast; so mote it be!   
                                                                          
 From the misty crystal sea                 By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn      
 Came the Lady to the lea                   Blessed Be the day you're born!  
 Sword and Roses in Her Hand                Fire burn and fire bright         
 Spread their seeds thruout the Land        Walk in safety thru the night       

                                                                            2289
