(8-1,Larne) OK all, standard procedure, a number of places after I say &lt;ga&gt;
            you're invited to add your own thoughts, in order of user number.
            If you don't want to add anything just say ga or something, so the 
            next person knows when to start.

            Today we meet to celebrate the spring equinox, which is also
            the first day of spring.  The time when day are night are equal,
            and the day continues to grow.  The weather is starting to get
            warmer, the days longer.  The Earth is starting to awaken, buds
            and blooms and shoots of all sorts are starting to appear.  And
            there's that unmistakable sense of spring in the air; not quite
            a smell, more like a feeling, vague and indistinct, but definitely
            there.
            ...
            
            Take a few deep breaths, in and out in and out...
            let all those worries and scheduals and plans that dominate
            most of our time turn to liquid and drip away, down into the
            ground.  Feel yourself freed from the constraints of time
            and space.  Become awake, alert, yet simultaneously relaxed
            and comfortable.
            ...

            Now, visualize a point of bright blue light to the east.
            Let it move in an arc towards the south, leaving a trail
            of cool blue fire behind it, seperating Where We Were
            from Where We Will Be.  

            Continue the arc to the south,

            then to the west

            then to the north

            then back to to the east.
            ...

            We have now isolated ourselves from the rest of the
            everyday world, but in doing so we have all come together,
            here Between the Worlds, joined by the joyfull dance of


                                                                            2191

            electrons and other, subtler, forces.  Take a moment to
            visualise us all together, and say a mental 'hi!' to everyone
            else.
            ...

            Turn your mind's eye to the east, and visualize incense smoke.
            Within that smoke are vague forms that, although they have no
            firm shape, give off a distinct sense of great knowledge.
            ...

            Eastern spirits of the Air!  We ask you to join us in our
            celebration and to share with us your gifts of undertsanding
            and insight.  Welcome!
            &lt;ga&gt;

(8-3, Felix Culpa) IHVH (Tracing pentagram) ga

(8-5,Tapestry) Welcome. ga

(8-6,Jehana) Hail and welcome, refreshing breezes! ga

(8-8,&gt;&gt;Nan&lt;&lt;) march winds that shake the walls of my house tonight...Welcome! 
              &lt;ga&gt;

(8-1,Larne) Now turn to the south, and visualize dancing flames.  See
            the indistinct forms there, and feel their strength.  These
            are obviously entities who can accomplish anything they
            strive for!
            ...

            Southern spirits of Fire!  We ask you to join our celebration,
            to help us manifest our own Wills into the world.  Welcome!
            &lt;ga&gt;

(8-3, Felix Culpa) ADONAI (tracing pentagram)

(8-5,Tapestry) Welcome, spirits of passion. ga

(8-6,Jehana) Hail &amp; welcome, passionate spirits of fiery will! ga

(8-8,&gt;&gt;Nan&lt;&lt;) welcome to our celebration dear warriors of the heart. &lt;ga&gt;

(8-1,Larne) Turn now to the west, and think of a large body of water.  Within
            its depths move other forms, beings whose emotions and capacity
            for empathy are as deep as the waters they move in.
            ...

            Western spirits of Water!  We ask you to join us in our 
            celebration, and to help us touch our own deep emotional cores. 
            Welcome!
            &lt;ga&gt;

(8-3, Felix Culpa) EHEIEH (tracing pentagram) ga

(8-5,Tapestry) Welcome, spirits (sprites) of LOVE! ga


                                                                            2192

(8-6,Jehana) Hail &amp; Welcome, waters of Intuition! ga

(8-8,&gt;&gt;Nan&lt;&lt;) welcome wisdom of the deeps, join our celebration and cleanse 
              and heal us. &lt;ga&gt; 

(8-1,Larne) Concentrate now on the north, and think of a patch of ground.
            Under it other entities move, entities that, though they are
            as without absolute shape as the others, are somehow extremely
            solid at the same time.
            ...

            Northern spirits of Earth!  We ask you to join in our celebration,
            and to remind us by your presence that each of us, also has a
            solid center that is as firm and real as the Earth Herself.
            &lt;ga&gt;

(8-3, Felix Culpa) AGLA (tracing pentagram) ga

(8-5,Tapestry) Wee, spirits of the earth, bring us your strength. ga

(8-6,Jehana) Hail &amp; welcome, bones of the land herself! ga

(8-8,&gt;&gt;Nan&lt;&lt;) sweet earth ones welcome to our celebration. &lt;ga&gt;

(8-1,Larne) Finally, turn back to the east, and complete the circle.
            Bright Mother, Goddess of the grass and trees, beautifull
            Lady of the gentle rains that nurish the soil, please
            join us!  We meet today to honor You, and to share Your
            joy in the life springing up around us.  Welcome!
            &lt;ga&gt;

(8-3, Felix Culpa) Before me:RAPHAEL
                   Behind me: GABRIEL
                   At my right hand: MICHAEL
                   At my left hand: AURIEL. ga

(8-5,Tapestry) Welcome, Great Lady! ga

(8-6,Jehana) Hail, gentle Lady, whose touch brings life's nurturance to the 
             land! ga

(8-8,&gt;&gt;Nan&lt;&lt;) hi mom &lt;grin&gt; ga

(8-1,Larne) Green Man, Herne, Radiant Sun that warms and lights us,
            God of the woods where once again bright spring colors
            are beginning to appear, we ask you to join us as well!
            Come, wake us from the long winter sleep, into the
            bright, green world!
            &lt;ga&gt;

(8-3, Felix Culpa) Come forth, O HORUS
                   Ye Crowned and Conquering Child
                   Come Ye forth and partake of our celebration. ga

(8-5,Tapestry) Welcome, my Great Horned Lord! ga


                                                                            2193

(8-6,Jehana) Hail &amp; welcome, Hunter Herne! ga

(8-8,&gt;&gt;Nan&lt;&lt;) a thousand welcomes oh laughing one. &lt;ga&gt;

(8-1,Larne) The Lord and Lady take hands, and slowly begin to dance
            across fields that have lain cold and hard all winter.
            Grains, grasses, flowers, young animals, all come out
            of their dark homes to see them and be nurished by their
            love.  We too need this nurishment as we come out into
            the daylight.  Both on a physical level, as well as to
            feed those hopes and desires we keep within us.  For myself,
            I will gladly take some of this energy to help me as I
            continue my efforts at musical composition.  May the music
            spring out of me as beutiful and vibrant as the flowers
            from the ground!
            ...

            Everyone, now take this energy within to feed those
            seeds within you.  Feel free to tell us what you are
            growing, or don't if it is something special and
            private you wish to keep to yourself.
            &lt;ga&gt;

(8-3, Felix Culpa) Come unto me, O MUSES! ga

(8-5,Tapestry) I ask for self-confidence to grow and flourish.

(8-6,Jehana) May growth and creativity flourish within me.
             May it spread to all those who wish to share with it. ga

(8-8,&gt;&gt;Nan&lt;&lt;) i breathe in the joy of spring to feed my creativity in my art 
              work and in my writing. and may i inhale the fertility of this 
              season so that i may breathe out and share it with ohters. ga

(8-1,Larne) Finally, as we rejoice in the lengthening days let
            us take a moment to think of Kuwait and the surrounding
            areas, where the thick foul smoke often prevents the sun
            from getting through at all, and chokes both plants and
            people.  Let us direct some of this nurishment to an area
            which has already suffered so much, and let us send
            our best wishes to the people who undertake the difficult
            and dangerous task of putting out all the burning oil wells.
            May a day soon come when we no longer need such dangerous
            and disgusting substances to provide our energy!

            Bright Lady and Lord, we thank you for joining us in our
            circle and sharing your love and joy with us.  We shall
            continue togrow in your presence!  Although you leave
            us now, you are always with us.  Hail and farewell!
            &lt;ga&gt;

(8-3, Felix Culpa) Hail and Farewell, O Ye Four Furies! ga

(8-6,Jehana) Hail &amp; farewell, Gentle Lady and Hunter Herne! ga


                                                                            2194

(8-5,Tapestry) Thank you for your love and sustenance. ga

(8-8,&gt;&gt;Nan&lt;&lt;) mahalo and aloha gentle dancers of the light. ga

(8-1,Larne) Focus yourselves again to the east.

(8-8,&gt;&gt;Nan&lt;&lt;) for your healing and your laughter we thank you watery ones. ga

(8-1,Larne) To the north...

            Spirits of Earth, we thank you for attending our rite
            and helping us feel our centers.  Hail and farewell!
            &lt;ga&gt;

                                                                            2195

(8-8,&gt;&gt;Nan&lt;&lt;) hail and farewell. ga

(8-1,Larne) Now unwind the circle, letting the arc collapse back into a point

            taking it back from east

            to north

            to west

            to south,

            and back to the east, 

            where it again become a bright point, which 
            goes back into the Earth.

            The circle is open, but never broken
