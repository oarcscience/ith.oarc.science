          ourselves...
          (1-6,HP) within...  ]
          (1-6,HP) &lt;Spinkle&gt;
          (1-6,HP) &lt;Sprinkle&gt;

          (1-6,HPS) [I will now conjure the circle, please visualize a bright
          blue...
          (1-6,HPS) perimeter]

          (1-6,HPS) Circle in, Circle out,

          (1-6,HP) Well, we're all in circle and have a ritual for the moon to
          boot.
          (1-6,HP) Anyone have any input they would like some group thought on? 
          We
          (1-6,HP) have a bit of collective thought to do later, also.
          (1-5,Shadow Hawk) I would like to thank the Lady for the fact...
          (1-5,Shadow Hawk) that so little life was lost due to Hurricane
          Andrew.

          the...
          (1-6,HP) magic time is ready.  Is that OK?  Where is she?
          (1-4,Greg) Dobbs Ferry, New York... that sounds fine

          of our...
          (1-6,HP) Lady's cycle.  Tonight we are all one!

          the...
          (1-6,HPS) Lady tonight.
          (1-6,HP) Would anyone else like to comment on what the full moon is to
          them?

          (1-6,HP) the warmth of love.
          (1-6,HP) [I hand the candle to the HPS]
          (1-6,HPS) [HPS carves a pentagram in the candle and says]
          (1-6,HPS) With love and trust I charge this candle to burn bright and
          long. It...
          (1-6,HPS) is to represent the Lady, the moon, and of course the Lord.

          saying]
          (1-6,HPS) Now, with all of us across the distances, if you have a
          candle,...

          those...
          (1-6,HPS) without should visualize one and procede along also.  The
          physical...
          (1-6,HPS) world NEVER INHIBITS the realm we are in now.
          (1-6,HPS) I want everyone to look into the flame of your candle.  Our
          computer...
          (1-6,HPS) desk is serving as an altar tonight, to make it a bit less
          hectic....
          (1-6,HPS) &lt;g&gt;.  Anyhow, look into the flame and see the moon.  So
          bright and...
          (1-6,HPS) full, this is the moon in your heart.
          (1-6,HP) Now look again into the flame of your candle, and see your-
          self in...


                                                                            2168

          (1-6,HP) that flame.  See your life energy as it really is.  The moon
          is your...
          (1-6,HP) heart, the flame, and you life energy.  It is one!
          (1-6,HPS) Let us pause for a moment and let yourself be one with the
          flame,...
          (1-6,HPS) the moon, and the Goddess.  Feel the warmth.  Feel the love.
          (1-6,HPS) Know the Goddess.
          (1-6,HPS) As the candle burns, remember not what was said, but remem-
          ber what
          (1-6,HPS) was done and felt.  You and the Goddess are one.
          (1-6,HP) For those with candles, let them burn till gone.  For those
          without,...
          (1-6,HP) let them burn in your mind till dawn.  For to snuff a flame
          before...
          (1-6,HP) it's time really pisses-off the fire faeries!
          (1-6,HP) Blessed Be!
          (1-6,HPS) So Mote It Be!

          (1-6,HP) [Speaking to the HPS]
          (1-6,HP) My Lady.  My Love. Does thou wish at this time to become one
          with...
          (1-6,HP) the Goddess?
          (1-6,HPS) Yes, I do.
          (1-6,HP) So Be It!
          (1-6,HP) [I raise my athame and point it towards the HPS while saying]
          (1-6,HP) My Lady, Tis I, once again, calling upon thee with the
          request for...

          (1-6,HPS) Blessed be my lord!
          (1-6,HPS) [HPS sprinkles the cakes with the Ale from her Athame and
          says]

          (1-6,HP) OK, can we continue, still a bit to do before we close...
          (1-4,Greg) Has everyone had cakes and wine?
          (1-7,Jehana Silverwing) yes.
          (1-3,Annina) &lt;taking a bite of cake&gt; Yes, thanks. :-)
          (1-6,Ted &amp; Nanette) yes.
          (1-4,Greg) Lets continue

          (1-6,HP) Now the celebration is almost through,
          (1-6,HP) And I would like to request of you,
          (1-6,HP) Work with me to make the sky blue.
          (1-6,HPS) The earth is our mother
          (1-6,HPS) From the start she has been there for us
          (1-6,HPS) And at the end she will remain
          (1-6,HP) As we care for each other in this physical world
          (1-6,HP) So must we care for our mother earth
          (1-6,HP) For now is a time with smoky air
          (1-6,HP)     now is a time with oceans of oil
          (1-6,HP)     now is a time with soil of garbage
          (1-6,HPS) Magic is in me.  Magic is in you.
          (1-6,HPS) Let us spend just a minute and think
          (1-6,HPS) For collective thoughts is the magic for all
          (1-6,HPS) Think and create.  For in our power lies enough to change
          (1-6,HPS) that which others deem a lost cause.
          (1-6,HPS) Think now, one and all, about the beautiful mother.  Healthy
          and...
          (1-6,HPS) happy and free from the diseases we have previously given
          her....
          (1-6,HPS) Let's make the magic happen.  See the mountains in the
          crystal clear...
          (1-6,HPS) sky.  See the clean oceans sparkling blue.  See her beauty
          under the...
          (1-6,HPS) full moon light.  Think...
          (1-6,HP) So Mote It Be!

          (1-6,HP) Greg, it was a bit unusual to see magic for you mom appearing
          in the...
          (1-6,HP) drawing down.  I've been under the belief that once magic is
          done is...
          (1-6,HP) should be left alone.  For any doubt will destroy the res-
          ults....
          (1-6,HP) Should we work more magic for her now, or should we call it
          done?...
          (1-6,HP) It's your call.
          (1-4,Greg) What we've worked felt pretty powerful...
          (1-4,Greg) I think it will do, my mother doesn't exactly know I asked
          for this.
          (1-6,HP) Well then, Thought of her will remain clear in all of us. 
          Thoughts...
          (1-6,HP) of her happy and healthy.  It is done.
          (1-4,Greg) Blessed Be!


                                                                            2171

          (1-6,HP) Does anyone want any other collective magic to be done, now
          is the...
          (1-6,HP) time.
          (1-3,Annina) I'd like you all to remember my husband's and my busin-
          ess. We are starting
          (1-3,Annina) it this week on a virtual shoestring as our venture
          capital deal fell through.
          (1-3,Annina) Your thoughts and meditations in your rituals would be
          very much appreciated.
          (1-6,HP) What is the business and where?  What are your goals?  I
          learned...
          (1-6,HP) long ago not to ask for vague things, they sneak up and bite
          you in...
          (1-6,HP) the butt.  That's an experience Loki taught me.
          (1-3,Annina) The business is a point of sales computer systems com-
          pany. We're in
          (1-3,Annina) Pensacola, Florida (on the Gulf Coast near Mobile, Ala.)
          (1-3,Annina) Our goals are to make 8 sales per month for the first 90
          days.
          (1-6,HP) Not too bad.
          (1-3,Annina) That will give us the capital to get things underway with
          an office and
          (1-3,Annina) a demo system.
          (1-6,HP) Everyone here please visualize Annina's company selling 30
          sales by...
          (1-3,Annina) We're running it out of our home at the moment. It's
          scary, but we KNOW
          (1-3,Annina) the business is there and we've done our homework and
          made the connections.
          (1-6,HP) the end of 90 days.  Envision happiness and of course wealth
          for...
          (1-6,HP) Annina and her husband.  From this thought in your heart turn
          it to...
          (1-6,HP) a color and send it to her now.
          (1-6,HP) Well Annina, I hope I didn't zap you.  In my vision I saw you
          so...
          (1-6,HP) busy after 60 days that you needed to hire help to handle all
          the...
          (1-3,Annina) WOW!! Green and pink and purple! Mostly green though. :-)
          (1-6,HP) work.  You will be successful.  As long as you remember that
          which...
          (1-6,HP) you want.
          (1-6,HPS) Great!
          (1-3,Annina) I definitely felt your strength!! Many thanks to all!
          (1-6,HP) Can we close or does anyone have naything else to add?
          (1-4,Greg) Best of blessings to you, Aninna, and your Husband
          (1-3,Annina) Thank you, Greg, and brightest blessings to you and your
          mother.
          (1-4,Greg) Many thanx!
          (1-6,HP) So be it!  Let us close this circle!
