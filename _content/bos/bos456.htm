          CompuServe Full Moon Ritual of Monday, June 15, 1992
           
          (1-3,S.H.) My Lady Otterkin, wilt thou begin the Lady's Rite?

          (1-4,Otterkin) This is the time of fullness,
               the flood tide of power,
               when the Lady in full circle of brightness
               rides across the night sky.
               This is the time of the bearing of fruits,
               of changes realized.
               The Great Mother,
               Nurturer of the world which is Herself,
               pours out her love and her gifts in Abundance.
               The Hunter draws near to the Brilliant One,
               She who awakens yearning in the heart
               and is the end of desire.
               We who look on her Shining face are filled with love.
               Merry Meet.

          (1-3,S.H.) By the Spirits of Air and Fire I do cleanse this
               space.

          (1-6,Otterkin) By the Creatures of Water and Earth I do cleanse
               this space.

          (1-3,S.H.) (visualize a circle filled with incense smoke...
               (while Otter and I walk the circle with lit incense,
               sprinkling water and salt to purify the area)
               Will the Caller of the North, Call forth!

          (1-7,Jeff) Hail, of the mountains, of the North, far above the
               earth...
               Whose core yet reaches the center...
               we ask you, guardians, to attend our Circle...
               Lend us your steadfastness...
               Hail!  And well Met!

          (1-3,S.H.) Hail and Well Met!

          (1-6,Otterkin) Hail and Well Met!

          (1-3,S.H.) Will the Caller of the East, Call Forth!

          (1-7,Jehana) Hail, spirits of the Air, wisps and eddies of
               wind...
               Sweeping the world with freshness...
               thought, contemplation, and wisdom...
               we ask you, guardians, to attend our Circle...
               Lend us your airy wisdom...
               Hail!  And well Met!

          (1-3,S.H.) Hail!  And well Met!

          (1-6,Otterkin) Hail and Well Met!


                                                                            2137

          (1-3,S.H.) Will the Caller of the South, Call forth!

          (1-3,Shadow Hawk) Hail Spirits of Fire, Noonday Sun...
               Lion of Summer, Heating and Lighting us against
               the Cold of Death
               We call upon you, of Fiery ones to attend our Circle...
               Lend us your Fiery Passion...
               Hail!  And Well Met!

          (1-3,S.H.) Hail!  And Well Met!

          (1-6,Otterkin) Hail! And Well Met!

          (1-3,S.H.) Will the Caller of the West, Call Forth!

          (1-1,Papa Tom) Spirits of the West, heed our call.
               Spirits of the West, Spirits of water, attend our Circle.
               Cleanse us, as rain upon the ocean.
               Give us guidance and wisdom as we go between the worlds.
               Guardians in the West, attend our Circle.
               Hail!  And well Met!

          (1-3,S.H.) Hail!  And Well Met!

          (1-6,Otterkin) Hail! And Well Met!

          (1-6,Otterkin) I conjure and cast thee, Circle of Power,
               that this may be a time that is not a time,
               in a place that is not a place,
               on a day that is not a day,
               We are safe between the worlds where Night and Day,
               Birth and Death, Joy and Sorrow, meet as one.

          (1-3,S.H.)I invoke thee and call upon thee,
               Lady and Mother of us all,
               bringer of all fruitfullness.
               By seed and root, by bud and stem,
               by leaf and flower and fruit,
               by life and love do I invoke thee
               to descend upon the body of this thy servant and priestess.
               Hail Aradia!  From the Amalthean Horn
               pour forth thy store of love.
               I lowly bend before thee,
               I adore thee to the End.
               Thy foot is to my Lip,
               my prayer upborne upon the rising incense smoke.
               Send Thine ancient love, oh Mighty One,
               descend to aid us, who without thee are forlorn.

          (1-6,Otterkin) Of the Mother Darksome and Devine,
               Mine the scourge, and mine the Kiss,
               the five-point star of Love and Bliss,
               so I charge you with this sign.
               (Visualize a pentagram drawn in cool flame before you.)


                                                                            2138

          (1-3,S.H.) Listen to the words of the Great Mother,
               She who is also called among men
               Astarte, Dana, Arianrhod, Isis,
               Demeter, Mary, Aradia, and by many other names.

          (1-4,ARADIA) Whenever you have need of any thing,
               once in the month,
               and better it be when the Moon is full,
               then shall ye assemble
               in some secret place and adore the spirit of me,
               who am Queen of all witches.
               There shall ye assemble,
               ye who are fain to learn all sorcery,
               yet have not won its deepest secrets,
               to these will I teach things that are yet unknown.
               And ye shall be free from slavery,
               and as a sign that ye be really free,
               ye shall be naked in your rites,
               and ye shall dance, sing, feast,
               make music and love, all in my praise.
               For mine is the secret door
               which opens upon the Land of Youth,
               and mine is the cup of the wine of life,
               and the Cauldron of Cerridwen,
               which is the Holy Grail of Immortality.
               I am the Gracious Goddess,
               who gives the gift of Joy unto the hearts of Man.
               Upon Earth, I give knowledge
               of the spirit eternal, and beyond death,
               I give peace, and freedom,
               and reunion with those who have gone before.
               Nor do I demand sacrifice,
               for behold, I am the Mother of all living,
               and my Love is poured out upon the Earth.&quot;

          (1-3,S.H.) Hear ye the words of the Star Goddess,
               She in the dust of whose feet
               are the hosts of Heaven,
               and whose body encircles the Universe.

          (1-4,CERRIDWEN) I who am the beauty of the green Earth,
               and the white Moon among the stars,
               and the mystery of the waters,
               and the desire of the hearts of man,
               call unto thy soul.
               Arise, and come unto me.
               For I am the soul of Nature,
               who gives life to the universe.
               From me all things proceed,
               and unto me all things must return,
               and before my face,
               beloved of Gods and of men.
               Let thine innermost divine self be enfolded
               in the rapture of the infinite.
               Let my worship be within the heart that rejoiceth.


                                                                            2139

               For behold, all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals.
               And therefore let there be beauty and strength,
               power and compassion, honour and humility,
               mirth and reverence within you.
               And thou who thinkest to seek for me,
               know thy seeking and yearning
               shall avail thee not, unless thou knowest the mystery,
               that if that which thou seekest
               thou findest not within thee,
               then thou shalt never find it without thee.
               For behold, I have been with thee from the beginning,
               and I am that which is attained at the end of desire.&quot;

          (1-3,S.H.) (Take this time to meditate on the Fullness of the
               Mother...
               And also on what is said in the Charge we have just been
               given, for truely...
               You will never find it without thee, but only within thee.)

          (1-3,S.H.) Now we come to the time of power, for the Moon is Full
               and we are gathered
               here in Her Circle, so we shall raise the Cone of Power...
               Visualize a fire in the night and we are together
               around the fire.  The Drums begin a rhythm, subtle but
               insistant. You begin to sway and move with the full
               sensual beat, dancing as only spirit can.  Around and
               around the fire you go while the drumming grows faster
               and louder.  You can FEEL the energies gathering, until
               your hair is flying wild, and your skin crawls with an
               energy like electricity.  You are alive with power!
               Join hands and chant with us:
                    &quot;Circle 'round the fire,
                    to raise a cone of power,
                    to bring what we desire,
                    So mote it be!
                    Circle 'round the fire,
                    to raise a cone of power,
                    to bring what we desire,
                    So mote it be!
               now SHOUT!
                    Circle 'round the fire,
                    to raise a cone of power,
                    to bring what we desire,
                    So mote it be!&quot;

          (1-4,Otterkin) I take this energy and with it I consecrate this
               Ritual Space, that it shall always be a safe haven for
               Her Children!  I take this energy and offer it to those that
               need healing.
               Those that have need, take from it, for I AM She that
               gives Life and Bounty, I AM the Mother of All!
               I take this energy, and I return it to the
               Universe, that there will be fruitfulness throughout
               the Worlds and all my Children shall benefit.&quot;


                                                                            2140

          (1-6,Otterkin) (Place your knife in front of you and take your
               chalice in hand)
               As I raise the chalice, you do likewise.
               I raise this chalice, symbol of my Eternal Womb,
               source of All That was and All That will be.
               (Take your knife, and hold it over the chalice, point down)

          (1-3,S.H.) I take this Athame, symbol of my Quickening essense,
               Life Fire that lights the Chalice within, and with it
               I Quicken thy fertile womb, O Mother of us all.

          (1-6,Otterkin) As the Chalice is to the Goddess, Awaiting the
               Spark

          (1-3,S.H.) And the Athame is to the God, so I enter into your
               hidden Dark.

          (1-6,Otterkin) And when Two becomes one
               (Dip the tip into the chalice)

          (1-3,S.H.) The Greatest magic is begun!

          (1-6,Otterkin) Drink from my depths and meditate on them, oh ye
               who would know of the full Circle of Birth and Death.
               (Accept our kiss, and taste the wine, saving a
               small portion for offering later.)
               I take these cakes, fruit of my fields, and I
               Bless them and give them to you.  
               Eat, that you may never hunger and think upon my Bounty.
               (Kiss, and eat the cake, saving a small portion
               for offering later.)
               I charge you to remember that some part of this bounty be
               returned to the Earth, that the cycle will continue.
               When you return to the World, give of the Bread
               and Water of Life to my Earth.

          (1-3,S.H.) Lady, thank you for attending this your Rite, Blessed
               Be your Name.

          (1-6,Otterkin) Will the caller of the West please thank and
               dismiss the Guardians?

          (1-1,Papa Tom) Spirit of the West, Spirit of Water.
               We thank you for your guidance.
               Your love.
               Your patience.
               We thank you for attending our circle.
               We part in love, until we meet again.

          (1-6,Otterkin) Will the caller of the South please thank and
               dismiss the Guardians?

          (1-3,Shadow Hawk) Guardians of the South, Spirits of Fire, we
               thank you for the Illumination
               that you have brought to this the Lady's


                                                                            2141

               Circle. As we part, we bid you
               to hold us safe throughout the day, that we may
               have light to guide our feet.  
               We bid you farewell until the next time we meet,  
               Hail and Farewell!

          (1-6,Otterkin) Hail and Farewell!

          (1-6,Otterkin) Will the caller of the East please thank and
                    dismiss the Guardians?

          (1-7,Jehana) Guardians of the East; Spirits of the Air
               We thank you for your contemplation
               We thank you for your gentle cleansing breezes
               We bring thanks to you for attending our Circle.
               We part in love, until we meet again.

          (1-6,Otterkin) Hail and Farewell!

          (1-3,Shadow Hawk) Hail and Farewell

          (1-6,Otterkin) Will the caller of the North please thank and
               dismiss the Guardians?

          (1-7,Jeff) To you who are of the mountains
               Deep roots; and clear vision
               we thank you for attending our Circle
               and lending us your steadfastness
               we part in love; until we meet again
               Hail &amp; farewell!!

          (1-6,Otterkin) Hail and Farewell!

          (1-3,Shadow Hawk) Hail and Farewell!

          (1-6,Otterkin) Now I drive the Circle down, down, down (through
               the wiring) into the ground, and Out to the boundaries
               of the Universe.
               The Circle is Open, but never broken.  Merry meet,
               merry part, and merry meet again!

          (1-3,Shadow Hawk) Merry meet again!
