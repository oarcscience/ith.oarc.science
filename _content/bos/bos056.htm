<center><h1>Principles of Wiccan Beliefs</h1><h4>1974, Council of American Witches</h4></center>
<ol>
<li><p>We practice rites to attune ourselves with the natural rhythm of life
forces marked by the phases of the Moon and the seasonal Quarters and Cross Quarter.</p></li>

<li><p>We recognize that our intelligence gives us a unique responsibility toward our
environment. We seek to live in harmony with Nature, in ecological balance offering fulfillment
to life and consciousness within an evolutionary concept.</p></li>

<li><p>We acknowledge a depth of power far greater than that apparent to the average person.
Because it is far greater than ordinary, it is sometimes called supernatural, but we see it as
lying within that which is naturally potential to all.</p></li>

<li><p>We conceive of the Creative Power in the universe as manifesting through polarity --
as masculine and feminine -- and that this same Creative Power lies in all people, and
functions through the interaction of the masculine and feminine. We value neither above the
other, knowing each to be supportive to the other. We value sex as pleasure, as the symbol and
embodiment of life, and as one of the sources of energies used in magickal practice and
religious worship.</p></li>

<li><p>We recognize both outer worlds and inner, or psychological, worlds sometimes known as the
Spiritual World, the Collective Unconscious, Inner Planes, etc. -- and we see in the
interaction of these two dimensions the basis for paranormal phenomena and magickal exercises.
We neglect neither dimension for the other, seeing both as necessary for our fulfillment.</p></li>

<li><p>We do not recognize any authoritarian hierarchy, but do honor those who teach, respect
those who share their greater knowledge and wisdom, and acknowledge those who have courageously
given of themselves in leadership.</p></li>

<li><p>We see religion, magick and wisdom in living as being united in the way one views the
world and lives within it -- a world view and philosophy of life which we identify as
Witchcraft -- the Wiccan Way.</p></li>

<li><p>Calling oneself &quot;Witch&quot; does not make a Witch -- but neither does heredity
itself, nor the collecting of titles, degrees and initiations. A Witch seeks to control the
forces within her/himself that make life possible in order to live wisely and well without harm
to others and in harmony with Nature.</p></li>

<li><p>We believe in the affirmation and fulfillment of life in a continuation of evolution and
development of consciousness giving meaning to the Universe we know and our personal role within
it.</p></li>

<li><p>Our only animosity towards Christianity, or towards any other religion or philosophy of
life, is to the extent that its institutions have claimed to be &quot;the only way&quot; and have
sought to deny freedom to others and to suppress other ways of religious practice and belief.</p></li>

<li><p>As American Witches, we are not threatened by debates on the history of the Craft, the
origins of various terms, the legitimacy of various aspects of different traditions. We are
concerned with our present and our future.</p></li>

<li><p>We do not accept the concept of absolute evil, nor do we worship any entity known as
&quot;Satan&quot; or &quot;the Devil&quot;, as defined by the Christian traditions. We do not
seek power through the suffering of others, nor accept that personal benefit can be derived only
by denial to another.</p></li>

<li><p>We believe that we should seek within Nature that which is contributory to our health and
wellbeing.</p></li>
