                                   --- A WICCANING  --- 
                                   Date: 08-31-92  18:25
                                   By: Ceridwen Goddess

           
            (please bear  in mind that since  non-Wiccans  were present  at this
          ceremony,  some things  WERE  toned down...we  did   not  perform  the
          Five-fold Kiss, or  a more emphatic  version of the Great  Rite... our
          horned statue of Pan  was left at home  in favor of a  small, antlered
          god-figure  from an  American Indian  motif.. we  did not  include the
          scourge  on  the alter,  or the  Cords (I  chose  instead to  wear our
          blue-colored Cord  around my waist, however),  and **most** references
          to the Horned  God were  altered to reflect  a less-imposing  Antlered
          One...  I do  hope that  those who  may read  this will  understand my
          reasoning for these actions.   
           
           
          Lammas 1992  
           
          I thought that i would share with you the ritual that  we performed in
          blessing our  children this  past Lammas  (we did  it  on July  30th),
          Blessings to you all! 
          -Heidi 
           
          A WICCANING: 
           
          --consecrate the salt and water 

          (Priestess takes her athame, plunges the blade into the container of 
          salt, &quot;So that you may be fit to dwell in this Sacred Space, I bless 
          this salt, in the names of our Lord and Lad, i bless this salt&quot; then 
          transfering three 'knife-fuls' to the container of [in this case 
          water taken from the beach where we held the ritual] water &quot;So that  
          you may be fit to dwell in this Sacred Space, I consecrate and bless 
          this water&quot; and stir the salt into the water.) 

          --purify work space with [salt-]water 
          (Priestess walks the diameter of the Circle and casts the [salt-]water
          along its perimeter) 

          --purify work space with incense and candle... 
          (Priest  traverses  the perimeter  of the  Circle with  frankincense &amp;
          myrrh and then a candle) 
           
          Priest hands athame to Priestess who casts the Sacred Circle: 
           
          &quot;With earth and air draw forth all that is fair 
          by fire and sea of ill stay free 
          O Circle, be thou a meeting-place of love and joy and truth 
          a shield against all wickedness and evil 
          a rampart of protection that shall preserve 
          the powers that we may raise within Thee. 
          Wherefore do i bless and consecrate thee. 
           
          Priestess welcomes all gathered into the Circle space: 
              &quot;May your mind be free, may  your heart be free, may your  body be
          free.&quot; 
           

                                           1493          

          Invoking the Watchtowers: 
           
          The Priestess takes the bowl of water to the East and says: 
           
          O cool lakes and deep seas of the East 
          waters soft and giving of fresh life 
          join with us -- 
          Cast your blessings upon these children 
          and become a friend to them! 
          Blessed Be. 
           
           
          All echo, &quot;Blessed Be!&quot; 
          (the water is placed at the east gate) 
           
          The Priestess takes a candle to the South and says: 
           
          O warm sun and warm skies of the South 
          bringing life anew, the growth of all things, 
          and promise of the future, 
          join us -- 
          Cast your blessings upon these children 
          and become a friend to them! 
          Blessed Be!

           
          All echo, &quot;Blessed Be!&quot; 
          (the candle is placed at the south gate) 
           
          The Priestess takes the censor/sage to the West and says: 
           
          O Winds of the East 
          who bring forth freshness, life, and joy... 
          join us -- 
          Cast your blessings upon these children 
          and and become a friend to them! 
          Blessed Be! 
           
           
          All echo, &quot;Blessed Be!&quot; 
          (the censor is placed at the west gate) 
           
          The Priestess takes the bowl of earth to the North and says: 
           
          O mighty mountains and endless steppes of the North 
          Meadows of green and the creatures that therein dwell 
          join us -- 
          cast your blessings upon these children 
          and become a friend to them. 
           
           
          All echo, &quot;Blessed Be!&quot; 
          (the bowl is set at the north gate) 
           

                                           1494          

           
          The Priestess holds the alter Wand aloft and asks: 
          &quot;Repeat after me.... 
          As above so below 
          as the Universe, so the soul 
          as without so within. 
          Blessed and Gracious Ones -- on this night 
          do we consecrate to you 
          our minds, our bodies, and our spirits. Blessed Be!&quot; 
           
           
          INVOKING THE GODDESS AND GOD 
           
          goddess: 
           
           
          All-dewy Sky-sailing Pregnant Moon 
          who shines for all 
          who flows through all 
          light of the world which is yourself 
          maiden mother crone 
          the weaver the green one 
           
          O most gracious and magnificent Lady 
          We ask that some portion of your presence 
          be here among us now 
          Give protection and shelter to the small 
          and sacred ones 
          who are here to be dedicated in Your honor. 
           
           
          god; 
           
          Seed sower, grain reborn 
          Antered One come! 
          Bright sun, Dark death, 
          Lord of winds, lord of the dance 
          sun-child, winter born king 
          Hanged one

          Stag and stallion, goat and bull, 
          sailor of the last sea, guardian of the gate 
          lord of the two lands 
          ever-dying, ever-living, radiance

          O ancient lord of the universe 
          we ask some portion of your presence here 
          among us now. 
          Shield and strengthen the children who shall be 
          dedicated in your honor! 
           
           

                                           1495          

           
          THE BLESSINGS and PURIFICATIONS 
           
          Maiden (in this case an unattached and close aunt of the children): 
          (as she sprinkles the children with barley) 
           
          &quot;Dearest ones, may you never know hunger or poverty for 
          material or spiritual things. I bless you with the barley 
          of the Spirits, for nourishment and wealth.&quot; 
           
          Mother (the Priestess who is the mother of the children): 
          (as she sprinkles the children with water) 
           
          &quot;I bless you in the name of the Spirits of all life and 
          healing, with the waters of the Earth, that you may be 
          healthy and strong in body, mind, and spirit. Let love  
          be your treasure, may you be happy in your heart.&quot; 
           
          Crone (the Priestess's mother and the grandmother of the children): 
          (as she sprinkles the children with salt) 
           
          &quot;Dearest ones, may you have access to your own wisdom 
          and that of others. May you be protected from foolishness 
          and self-destruction. May you know the essence of things; 
          may you be bright and find it easy to learn and teach.&quot; 
           
          The Antlered One (the Priest, who is the father of the children): 
          (fire/sage incense) 
            
          &quot;With the Fire of the Universe to spark your temper, 
          I would ask that you may find joy and a sense of merriment 
          in all that you accomplish - to see the lighter side 
          of life's journey and find happiness in your work.&quot; 
           
           
          THE DIVULGENCE OF THE NAMES (explained to the Witnesses): 
           
          ANCIENT EUROPEAN PEOPLES BELIEVED THAT YOU MUST HAVE TWO 
          NAMES, ONE PUBLIC AND ONE A SECRET NAME THAT ONLY THOSE 
          PRESENT AT THE BLESSING CEREMONY KNEW. THIS SECOND NAME 
          IS FOR USE AFTER PUBERTY, WHEN THE SOUL CHANGES INTO ITS  
          FIRST ADULT SELF, WHEN IT CAN BE UTTERED ONCE MORE, AND 
          MADE PUBLIC. THE PURPOSE OF THE FIRST PUBLIC NAME WAS TO 
          DIVERT THE EVIL EYE, TO GAIN FAVOR WITH THE FATES, TO  
          KEEP AWAY SICKNESS, AND TO HELP THE CHILD REACH ADULTHOOD. 
           
          Priestess: 
          &quot;Great Spirit of Nature, protect and guide these young souls 
          among us. 
          May the Blessings of the wise and joyous Father of the Gods 
          far-seeing and far-knowing be upon thee. 
          May the blessings of the Triple Goddess, 
          of Maiden, of Mother, of Crone, and all their power 
          be upon thee.&quot; 
           
           
          The following blessings/invocations were spoken and followed by 
          the child being immersed in the ocean water of the beach where 
          the ritual was held: 
           

                                           1496          

          ELIZABETH'S DUNKING: 
           
          Anna Perenna 
          Great Goddess, Mother of All 
          Envelope this daughter of yours 
          in the waters of Your womb 
          Grant her protection from wrong-doing 
          Wash away the memories of her pain 
          Shower her with Your blessings 
          in a life everlasting 
          Bless Elizabeth Mae Luzerne. 
          So Mote it Be! 
           
           
          PATRICK'S DUNKING: 
           
          Great Goddess, Nurturer and Bearer of all Men, great and small 
          Without whose womb they would not be 
          Mother of Gods, of Sacrificial Kings, 
          Presidents, Emperors, and beggars 
          Welcome this son of Yours into Your Light 
          and as you have taught us, let him find 
          &quot;Beauty and strength, power and compassion, 
          mirth and reverence, honor and humility&quot; 
          within his heart.  
          Wash his fears away with your caress! 
          Bless Patrick Howard Lloyd! 
          Blessed Be! 
           
           
          MORGAINNE'S DUNKING: 
           
          Hail, o gracious and most magnificent Lady 
          whose slender hand turns the vast wheel of the sky. 
          whose triple aspect does see 
          the beginning, the life, and the end of all things. 
          whose wells of mystery do give 
          inspiration and rebirth thoughout eternity, 
          receive here this small daughter of yours with blessings 
          and with love. 
          Bless Morgainne Ellayne! 
          So mote it be! 
           
           
          (explained to the Witnesses:) 
          THE SECOND NAMES CHOSEN WERE DECIDED UPON FOR BOTH WHIMSICAL 
          AND SERIOUS REASONS -- FOR PERSONALITY AND FOR CIRCUMSTANCE. 
           
          &quot;For this newest arrival, a small girl-child who came as 
          an unplanned gift from the gods, whose arrival has 
          challenged us and helped us grow, as did her namesake, 
          bringing all of Mankind's challenges upon him, she is 
          called PANDORA.&quot; 
           
          &quot;For a small boy-child who seems to live for good food and drink, 
          who enjoys this life he's been blessed with, and who reminds us 
          that merriment is part of our everyday challenge as well as 
          paying the bills and doing the housework, so we found inspiration 
          in the spirited and fun-loving god of wine, and give his name 
          to our son, who will be BACCHUS.&quot; 

                                           1497          

           
           
          (our oldest, 4 year old daughter was severely burned when she was 
          16 months old, thus the inspiration for her naming...) 
           
          &quot;And at last, for our eldest daughter, as did the beautiful bird rise 
          miraculously from its burning, so did she -- and aptly she is 
          named PHOENIX.&quot; 
           
           
          Priestess: 
          &quot;O Lady of the Starry Heavens, Wise All-Father, behold these 
          lovely children, PANDORA, BACCHUS, and PHOENIX 
          conceived and brought forth in love. 
          Bless and protect them and grant the gifts of wisdom, 
          inspiration, and wonder, adorn them with your enduring 
          and eternal strength and steadfastness. May they ever 
          have spirits that seek the stars, and roots that hold 
          tight deep within thy loving breast.&quot; 
           
           
           
          SHARING OF THE BREAD AND WINE: 
           
          Priestess blesses the wine, dipping the athame into the chalice: 
          &quot;As the cup is to the female so the athame is to the male, 
          and conjoined they bring blessed creation&quot; 
           
           
          &quot;Offering to the Mother: 
          Hail Earth, Mother of All! 
          May your fileds increase and flourish. 
          Your forests grow and spread, 
          And your waters run pure and free! 
          Accept my offering, O Earth Mother! 
          Bring forth that which is good, and sustaining, 
          For every living thing!&quot; 
           
           
          --The Bread: 
          As the bread is passed around, the Priestess asks for its 
          glorification: 
           
          &quot;Let us join hands and purify ourselves 
          breathing in the life force of the universe 
          and expelling all evil from us. 
          Take now of the bread 
          and know of the grain of which you partake 
          as the latest of countless generations 
          growing to fruitfulness 
          and in dying, giving of the seeds 
          from which new life shall spring 
          Know that every seed, every grain is 
          the record of times most ancient 
          and a promise of all that shall be. 
          Partake of the bread 
          and know of life eternal and of Immortality. 
          With this knowledge are our souls sustained.&quot; 
           
           

                                           1498          

          --The Wine: 
           
          As the Chalice of wine is shared around the Circle, the 
          Priestess asks for it's glorification, also: 
           
          Drink now of the wine 
          And know of the tranformation 
          of simple fruits to sparkling elixir 
          as this wine has undergone change 
          so by life's cauldron shall we 
          As this wine gives the enchantment of the Divine 
          or abasement into the lower realms, 
          so do all humans rise or fall in each life 
          As their own will and strength determines. 
           
           
          --The Storytelling: 
          at this point the group of celebrants and the witnesses were asked 
          to seat themselves and the Priestess read a story called &quot;The Burning 
          of the Lady's People&quot; chosen from a collection of Goddess tales, 
          THE STORYTELLER'S GODDESS by Carolyn McVickar Edwards. 
           
           
           
           
          --OPENING THE CIRCLE: 
           
          All join hands, Priestess says: 
          &quot;Lords of the Winds, the Fires, the Seas, and the Fields, before you 
          depart to your fair and lovely realms, we thank you for your presence 
          this evening! Blessed be! ... 
           
          May the Circle be open but not broken 
          may the Beauty of the Goddess and the Strength of the God 
          dwell in our hearts. Merry meet, and merry part, and merry 
          meet again. Blessed Be!&quot; 
           
          END 
           
           
          The  Priestess of  EarthWorld Circle  wishes to  acknowledge the  many
          sources from which these invocations and blessings and ritual writings
          were chosen including MAGICAL RITES FROM THE CRYSTAL WELL by Ed Fitch,
          and several of the various books by Stewart and Janet Farrar, Doreen  
          Valiente, Starhawke's THE SPIRAL DANCE, A WICCAN BARDO by Paul Beyerl,
          and probably  others that i've  forgotten their original  sources over
          the years of use.
