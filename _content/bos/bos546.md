             RITUS OLYMPICUS PENTAGRAMMOU MINOR AD EXPELLENDUM

                        (c) 1993, John Opsopaus

    Preface

    The following is an adaptation of the Lesser Banishing Ritual
    of the Pentagram to the Graeco-Roman Tradition, and so it is
    called the "Olympic Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram."
    Such a "translation" is possible because the LBRP is an
    enactment in a Qabalistic framework of certain shamanic
    practices that are nearly universal.  Once the underlying
    shamanic cosmology has been identified, it's relatively
    straight-forward to reexpress the ritual in the terms of
    another cosmology, such as the Graeco-Roman.

    I would welcome criticism of the result, especially from
    Qabalists and Ceremonial Magicians.  Criticism/correction of
    my Latin and Greek composition will also be appreciated.
    Finally, I beg readers to forgive the Early Modern English,
    which I've used to add dignity to the text.

    The Ritual follows in summary form; a separate posting will
    contain a fully annotated text.  This information should make
    clear which aspects of the ritual follow from Ancient
    Tradition, which come from more recent Magical Traditions, and
    which are a result of my speculation or arbitrary choice; such
    information is all too often missing from Neopagan recon-
    structions.  If anyone knows of a similar adaptation, please
    let me know.

    Gratias vobis ago,

                         Ritus  Olympicus

                        Pentagrammou Minor

                          ad Expellendum


       The Olympic Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram

                             which is

     The Traditional Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram
              Adapted to the Graeco-Roman Tradition

                      (c)1993, John Opsopaus


    I.  The Opening Tau Cross

    i.  Close thine eyes, and by thy breath fan thou the Fire,
    which awakeneth the Serpent and the Eagle.  Allow thyself to
    grow beyond all bounds of space, until the Universe is
    2405

    within thee.  Be thou as a God; be thou as a Goddess.

    ij.  Draw thou down the Fire of Heaven into thy Heart, and
    say:
      "From Celestial Fire"
      "Ab Igne Caelesti"
      "Apo tou Ouraniou Puros"
      [)Apo  tou= )Oura/niou Puros/]

    [Suggested gestures for the preceding step:  Raise your arms
    into a horizontal, cross position, with palms up (in Celestial
    Invocation).  Bring them together above your head, palm to
    palm, and then draw the Celestial Fire down to your heart,
    while saying "From Celestial Fire."]

    [The words to be spoken by the practitioner are given in
    English, Latin and Greek.  In an attempt to combine
    readability and accuracy, I've given the Greek text two ways,
    in a simple but approximate Roman transcription, and in "Beta
    code," a standard ASCII representation of Greek including all
    the accents, breathings, etc.  Beta code transcriptions are
    enclosed in square brackets.  The Beta code transcriptions
    should be reasonably comprehensible with the following
    information:  ")" and "(" represent smooth and rough
    breathing, respectively; "/", "&" and "=" represent acute,
    grave and circumflex accents, respectively; "|" is iota
    subscript.]

    iij.  Guide thou the bright Beam downward, until it stirreth
    the Subterranean Waters of the Abyss and bringeth Them to
    life; and while so doing, say thou:
      "To Watery Abyss"
      "Ad Aquosum Profundum"
      "Eis ten Hudroessan Abusson"
      [)Eiss thnn (Udro/essan )/Abusson]

    [Suggested gesture:  Keep the palms together and move them
    down in front of the groin.  Then separate the hands and hold
    them to the sides and slightly forward, with palms down (in
    Chthonic Invocation).]

    iv.  Direct thou the beam from thy heart through thy left
    shoulder, until it stretcheth to the Moon, and say:
      "By Way of Earth"
      "Via Terrena"
      "Kat' Hodon Chthonion"
      [Kat' (Odonn Xqo/nion]

    [Suggested gesture:  Raise the left hand up to your chest;
    then extend your arm into horizontal position, with the palm
    forward.]

    v.  Direct thou the beam from thy heart through thy right
    shoulder, until it stretcheth to the Sun, and say:
      "By Way of Air"
      "Via Aeria"
      "Kat' Hodon Aitherion"
      [Kat' (Odonn )Aiqe/rion]
    2406

    [Suggested gesture:  Raise the right arm to the chest and then
    into a horizontal position, with forward palm.]

    vi.  Feel thou the Sacred Tau Cross that blazeth inside
    thee.  Now cross thy arms over thy Heart, and say:
      "Abiding always in the Center.  So be it!"
      "Semper in Medio manens.  Esto!" or "Fiat!"
      "En Omphaloi aei menon" (masc.) or "menousa" (fem.).  "Esto!"
      [)En )Omfalw=| a)ei  me/nwn] (masc.) or [me/nousa] (fem.).
      [)/Estw!]

    [Suggested gesture:  Bring your arms together and cross them
    over your chest.]

    vij.  As thou makest this gesture the Moon and Sun will
    stand together above thy head, nor will they ever move from
    there.  Moon over Sun and Sun over Tau Cross; thou art the
    Holy Caduceus.  Thou hast become the Center of the World,
    for the Cosmic Axis runneth through thy spine; on thy left
    standeth the Path of the Moon, and on thy right the Path of
    the Sun, above thee shineth the Cosmic Pole, below thee
    lieth the Abyss.

    viij.  Thou standest upon the Sacred Mountain, the World
    Navel, under which hideth the Watery Abyss.  At thy back
    groweth the Tree of Life, which stretcheth over thy head,
    the Navel Cord, for the Mountain and Tree are the Cosmic
    Pillar, which supporteth the four Quarters of the Heavens.
    From Calypso's Cave between the Tree's  roots, which
    penetrate the Abyss, are the four springs, which flow to the
    four Quarters of the World, and they run with water, honey,
    milk and wine.  Around the World Tree's trunk coileth thrice
    and half again the Serpent.  In the Cosmic Tree's leaves
    percheth the Eagle of Zeus, guarding the Horn of Amalthea,
    from which Nectar floweth into the Libation Bowl, the
    Bountiful Breast, which overfloweth, raining Nectar on the
    World.  Ambrosia floweth up the trunk of the Tree from the
    Deep.  Illumination cometh from Above and Growth cometh from
    Below.  The World Tree is the Tree of Destiny and Its leaves
    are the Book of Fate, for as they fall, so fall to earth the
    winged souls of the folk, ever singing in its foliage.

    ix.  Divine Helen, Leto's Daughter, with large breasts,
    liveth in the Bountiful Cosmic Tree, for she is Its Spirit;
    and Her Brothers, the Dioskouroi, Sons of Zeus [Dios Kouroi]
    the All-Shining [Pamphaes], the Heavenly Twins of Leto,
    command the Sacred Paths on either side.  For Castor, who
    resideth underground, knoweth the Lunar Discipline and
    controlleth the Way of Descent, and Polydeuces, who liveth
    above, is Master of the Solar Discipline and controlleth the
    Way of Ascent.

    x.  For learn thou this about the Way of Ascent.  It is
    under the jurisdiction of Zeus, the Sky Shaker, who giveth
    fertilizing rain and nourishing sunlight.  He holdeth the
    Lightning Bolt of Illumination, and His lightning descendeth
    from the Sky.  The Way of Ascent is to climb Scylla's
    Mountain, which riseth into the clouds, nor can its peak
    2407

    ever be seen.  Prometheus or Apollo will show thee the Way.
    Thy Helper in this journey is the Horse Pegasos, but also
    the Soaring Eagle, Dove and Goose.  Then wilt thou break
    through the Vault of the Heaven, and going through the
    Celestial Pole thou wilt ascend the Heavens.  For this is
    the Way of Light, the Path by Day, the Sun's Way, the Path
    of the Sage.

    xi.  And learn thou this about the Way of Descent.  It is
    under the jurisdiction of Poseidon, the Earth Shaker, who
    giveth fresh water from springs, but also floods and
    earthquakes.  He holdeth the Trident of Ecstasy and His
    lightning leapeth up from the Earth.  The Way of Descent is
    by the precipice opposite Scylla's cliff, which is the lower
    of the two, and from it groweth the Sacred Fig Tree.  Climb
    thou down from this Tree to Charybdis, by which thou wilt be
    drawn into the Watery Abyss.  Circe or Herakles will show
    thee the Way past the Dog and Gatekeeper.  Thy Helper in
    this journey is the Serpent Python, but also the Raging Lion
    and Bull.  Then wilt thou break through the Vault of the
    Abyss and, going down the Well, thou wilt descend through
    its levels.  For this is the Way of Darkness, the Path by
    Night, the Moon's Way, the Path of the Mage.

    xij.  But the Wise know that the Way Up and the Way Down are
    the same, for they are both on the Cosmic Pillar, and
    sometimes our task demandeth that we go up it, and sometimes
    it demandeth that we go down it.  When Duty calleth, we
    travel by Day or Night as is the need.  Ask thou Hermes for
    guidance, for he frequenteth the Navel.

    II.  Pentagrams of the Quarters

    xiij.  This is the way thou wilt draw the Shining Pentagrams
    that wardeth each Quarter. The first ray goeth from the
    lower left to the top, and each ray continueth from the
    last.  And as thou makest each ray, sing a letter of the
    Name of the Pentagram.

    xiv(a).  In Greek the Pentagram  hath the Name HUGIEIA
    [U(GI/EIA], which meaneth Soundness or Wholeness, so sing
    thou the sounds:
      "Huuuuuuu, Gggggggg, Iiiiiiih, Aaaaaay, Aaaaaaah."

    xiv(b).  In Latin the Pentagram hath the Name SALUS, which
    meaneth Soundness or Welfare, so sing thou the sounds:
      "Ssssssss, Aaaaaaah, Llllllll, Uuuuuuuu, Ssssssss."

    xiv(c).  Though in English we label the Pentagram WHOLE or
    SOUND, its spoken Name is WHOLENESS, so sing thou the
    sounds:
      "Hooooooo, Llllllll, Nnnnnnnn, Eeeeeeeh, Ssssssss."

    xv.  Now go thou to the East and make the Pentagram.  As
    thou callest:
      "Jupiter" or "Zeus"
      "Iuppiter"
      "Zeus" [Zeu/s]
    2408

    hurl thou His Thunderbolt through the center of the
    Pentagram, and see it fly away to Infinity.

    [Iuno / Hera [(/Hra] might also be appropriate for the East
    (She is not an Earth Goddess), in which case you should throw
    Her Cuckoo-bearing Sceptre, which represents the Celestial
    Spirit nesting on the top of the World Tree.  (Zeus first came
    to Hera in the form of a Cuckoo.)]

    xvi.  Now with thy Staff forge thou the Fiery Ring, drawing
    it from the center of the Eastern Pentagram and stretching
    it to the South, where thou wilt make another Pentagram, but
    call:
      "Vesta" or "Hestia"
      "Vesta" [pron. "Westa"]
      "Hestia" [(Esti/a]
    and throw thou Her Burning Circle.

    xvij.  Then to the West:
      "Neptune" or "Poseidon"
      "Neptunus"
      "Poseidon" [Poseidw/n]
    Hurl thou His Trident.

    xviij.  Then to the North:
      "Ceres" or "Demeter"
      "Ceres"  [pron. "Keres"]
      "Demeter" [Dhmh/thr]
    Throw thou Her Torch.

    [Pluto / Hades [(/Aidhs] would also be appropriate for the
    North, in which case his Helmet of Invisibility should be
    projected through the Pentagram.  Hades' name may mean "the
    Unseen" ["(/Aidhs" < "a) idh/s"].]

    xix.  Then draw thou the Fiery Ring back to its beginning,
    so it burneth on every side.  Then will the Barrier expand
    above and below until thou art surrounded by the Glowing
    Sphere.

    [When projecting the Four Weapons through the Pentagrams, the
    practitioner might find it helpful to make an appropriate
    gesture:  as though throwing a dart for Zeus's Keraunos, as
    though throwing a frisbee for Hestia's Burning Ring, as though
    throwing a javelin for Poseidon's Trident, as though throwing
    a knife for Demeter's Torch.]


    III.  Wards of the Quarters

    xx.  Now raise again thy arms so thou art the Sacred Tau and,
    focusing thine attention before thee (Eastward), say:
      "Before, Apollo"
      "Ante, Apollo"
      "Prosthen, Apollon"
      [Pro/sqen, )Apo/llwn]
    Apollo will appear before thee in all His Glory, Bow in hand,
    facing thee.  Then will He turn His back to watch the Eastern
    2409

    Quarter.

    [Mercurius/Hermes [(Ermh=s], with His Caduceus, would also be
    appropriate for the East.]

    xxi.  West:  Focusing thine attention behind thee, say:          
      "Behind, Diana/Artemis"
      "Post, Diana"
      "Opisthen, Artemis"
      [)/Opisqen,  )/Artemis]
    Artemis will appear with Her Bow.  Then will She turn away to
    watch the West.

    [Venus/Aphrodite [)Afrodi/th], arising from the waves and
    holding Her Zona (Girdle), would also be appropriate for the
    West.]

    xxij.  South:  Focusing thine attention to thy right, say:
      "On the right, Minerva/Athena"
      "Dextra, Minerva"
      "Epidexia, Athena."
      [)Epide/cia, )Aqhna=]
    Athena will appear with Her Aegis and Spear, and turn to
    watch the South.

    [Mars / Ares [)/Arhs] (with Shield and Sword) or Volcanus /
    Hephaistos [(/Hfaistos] (with Hammer and Tongs) would also be
    appropriate for the South; Mars was also an Italic vegetation
    God, and so might be evoked in the North.]

    xxiij.  North:  Focusing thine attention to thy left, say:
      "On the left, Bacchus/Dionysos"
      "Sinistra, Bacchus"
      "Ep' aristera, Dionusos"
      [)Ep' a)ristera/, Dio/nusos]
    Dionysus will appear with His Thyrsus, and then turn to
    watch the North.

    [Pan [Pa/n], with His Pipes, would also be appropriate for the
    North.  Pan may seem an unlikely Ward, but when Athens honored
    Him and asked Him to help defend them from the Persians, he
    did so (Herodt. VI.105.2-3).]

    xxiv.  In thy mind, thank all the Wards of the Quarters for
    Their protection.


    IV.  The Macrocosm in the Microcosm

    xxv.  Spread thy feet apart and assume thou the form of the
    Sacred Pentagram, which Pythagoras hath called Hugieia
    (Salus, Whole/Sound).  When the Pentagram flameth around
    thee, say:
      "For around flameth the Pentagram."
      "Nam circa flagrat Pentagrammon."
      "Peri men gar phlegei to Pentagrammon"
      [Peri  menn garr fle/gei to  Penta/grammon]

    2410

    [If you prefer "For around flame the Pentagrams," then use:
      "Nam circa flagrant Pentagramma"
      "Peri men gar phlegousi ta Pentagramma"
      [Peri  menn garr fle/gousi ta  Penta/gramma]

    xxvi.  When the Sacred Hexagram shineth within thee, say:
      "And within shineth the Six-rayed Star."
      "Atque intra lucet Stella Sexradiata."
      "Entos de lampei ho Hexaktinotos Aster."
      [)Entoss de  la/mpei o( E(caktinwtoss )Asth/r.]

    [If you prefer your Hexagram shining above rather than within,
    then say "super" instead of "intra," or "Huper" [(Upe/r]
    instead of "Entos."  However, I think it's better to have it
    within (see the notes for the reason).]

    xxvij.  The Pentagram signifieth the Microcosm, and the
    Hexagram signifieth the Macrocosm.  Thus the Macrocosm
    shineth within the Illuminated Microcosm.


    V.  The Closing Tau Cross

    xxviij.  Repeat thou the Tau Cross as it was at the beginning.

    [The following alternative gestures incorporate the relation
    of the elements embodied in the Hexagram:  As you recite the
    text of the Tau Cross, (1) begin with arms crossed, right over
    left, on your chest; (2) raise your right arm to the Celestial
    Fire, (3) lower your left arm to the Watery Abyss, (4) let the
    Fire draw up the Water to yield Earth, by moving your left arm
    up to your chest and out to the left, the Way of Earth; (5)
    let the Water draw down the Fire to yield Air, by moving your
    right arm down to your chest and out to your right, the Way of
    Air; (6) cross your arms over your chest, indicating the
    Reconciliation, Union and Balance of the Oppositions (Bivium),
    Worlds (Trivium) and Elemental Quarters (Quadrivium).  I must
    admit, however, that these gestures seem somewhat awkward.]

    xxix.  Thou hast made for thyself a Sacred Space at the
    World's Navel.  Ascending on thy Right is the Light Path and
    descending on thy Left is the Dark Path, but remember thou
    that the Wise One knoweth that the Way Up and the Way Down are
    the same and that together they make the one Path of Wisdom.
    So must it be.

                          finis
