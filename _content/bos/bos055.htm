<center><h1>An Introduction to Traditional Wicca</h1>
<h4>&copy; 1987, Keepers of the Ancient Mysteries ( .K.A.M. )</h4></center>

<p>Often Traditional Wiccans are asked to describe our religion and beliefs for interested
people, who may or may not have confused us with other Pagan religions, with inversions of
Christian/Islamic religions like Satanism, or with purely magical traditions with no religious
base. There is a lot of flexibility in the ways that we describe ourselves, and one
characteristic of Wicca is a large degree of personal liberty to practice as we please. Still,
there is an outline that can be described in general terms. Many traditions will depart from one
particular or another, but groups departing from all or most of these features are probably
non-Wiccan Traditions attempting to stretch or distort the Wiccan name to cover what they want
to do.</p>

<h3>Mysteries and Initiation</h3>

<p>Wicca is an Initiatory religion descended from the Ancient Mystery Religions. A mystery
religion is not like Catholicism where a Priest is the contact point between the worshiper and
the Deity, nor like Protestantism where a sacred Book provides the contact and guidelines for
being with the divine. Rather a Mystery Religion is a religion of personal experience and
responsibility, in which each worshiper is encouraged, taught and expected to develop an ongoing
and positive direct relationship with the Gods. The religion is called a &quot;Mystery&quot;
because such experiences are very hard to communicate in words, and are usually distorted in the
telling. You have to have been there in person to appreciate what is meant. Near and far-Eastern
religions like Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism and Shinto are probably Mystery traditions, but Wicca
is very western in cultural flavor and quite different than eastern religions in many ways.</p>

<h3>A Blend of Pagan Roots</h3>

<p>Most Wiccan Traditions, .K.A.M. included, have particular roots in the British Mystery
Traditions. This includes traditions of the Picts who lived before the rise of Celtic
consciousness, the early Celts, and some selected aspects of Celtic Druidism. American Wicca is
directly descended from British Wicca, brought in the late 1950's by English and American
Initiates of Gardnerian, Alexandrian and Celtic Wicca. These traditions are a little like the
denominations in Christianity, but hopefully far more harmonious.</p>

<p>While British Traditions are very strong in Wicca, or the Craft as it is sometimes called,
other Western Mystery traditions feature prominently, including the ancient Greek Mysteries of
Eleusis, Italian Mysteries of Rome, Etruria and the general countryside, Mysteries of Egypt and
Persia before Islam, and various Babylonian, Assyrian and other mid-eastern Mysteries that
flourished before the political rise of the advocates of &quot;one god&quot;.</p>

<h3>What's In a Name?</h3>

<p>Wicca, Witchcraft, and &quot;The Craft&quot; are used interchangeably at times by many kinds
of people. It is fair to say that all Wiccans are Witches, and many of us believe we are the only
people entitled to the name. It is important to know that many people call themselves witches who
are not in the least Wiccan, and that Masons also refer to themselves as &quot;Craft&quot;, with
good historical precedent. Carefully question people on the particular things they do and believe
as part of their religion rather than relying on labels. Any real Wiccan would welcome such
honest inquiry.</p>

<h3>Traditions and Flavor</h3>

<p>There are specific Wiccan beliefs and traditions, including worship of an equal and mated
Goddess and God who take many forms and have many Names. Groups who worship only a Goddess or
only a God are not traditional Wicca however they may protest, although they may be perfectly
good Pagans of another sort. The Wiccan Goddess and God are linked to nature, ordinary love and
children -- Wicca is very life affirming in flavor.</p>

<p>Because we have and love our own Gods, Wiccans have nothing to do with other people's deities
or devils, like the Christian God or Satan, the Muslim Allah or the Jewish Jehovah (reputedly not
his real name). Christians often deny this fact because they think that their particular god is
the only God, and everybody else in the whole world must be worshipping their devil. How arrogant.
They're wrong on both counts.</p>

<p>Traditional Wicca is a religion of personal responsibility and growth. Initiates take on a
particular obligation to personal development throughout their lives, and work hard to achieve
what we call our &quot;True Will&quot;, which is the best possibility that we can conceive for
ourselves. Finding your Will isn't easy, and requires a lot of honesty, courage and hard work.
It is also very rewarding.</p>

<p>Wicca is generally a cheerful religion, and has many holidays and festivals. In fact, most of
the more pleasant holidays now on our calendar are descended from the roots Wicca draws on,
including Christmas, May Day, Easter and Summer Vacation. Wicca is definitely not always serious.
Dancing, feasting and general merriment are a central part of the celebrations.</p>

<h3>Wiccan Ethics</h3>

<p>Wiccans have ethics which are different in nature than most &quot;one-god&quot; religions,
which hand out a list of &quot;do's and don'ts&quot;. We have a single extremely powerful ethical
principal which Initiates are responsible for applying in specific situations according to their
best judgment. That principle is called the Wiccan Rede (Old-English for rule) and reads:<p>

<ul>&quot;An (if) it harm none, do as ye Will&quot;</ul>

<p>Based on the earlier mention of &quot;True Will&quot;, you will understand that the Rede is
far more complex than it sounds, and is quite different than saying &quot;Do whatever you want as
long as nobody is hurt&quot;. Finding out your Will is difficult sometimes, and figuring out what
is harmful, rather than just painful or unpleasant is not much easier.</p>

<h3>Initiation into Wicca</h3>

<p>People become Wiccans only by Initiation, which is a process of contacting and forming a good
relationship with the Gods and Goddesses of Wicca. Initiation is preceded by at least a year and
a day of preparation and study, and must be performed by a qualified Wiccan Priestess and Priest.
The central event of Initiation is between you and your Gods, but the Priestess is necessary to
make the Initiation a Wiccan one, to pass some of her power onto you as a new-made Priestess or
Priest and to connect you to the Tradition you're joining.</p>

<p>Women hold the central place in Wicca. A Traditional Coven is always headed by a High
Priestess, a Third Degree female Witch with at least three years and three days of specific
training. A Priest is optional, but the Priestess is essential. Similarly, a Priest may not
Initiate without a Priestess, but a Priestess alone is sufficient. Women are primary in Wicca for
many reasons, one of which is that the Goddess is central to our religion.</p>

<h3>One Religion at a Time</h3>

<p>People often ask &quot;Can I become a Wiccan and still remain a Christian, Muslim, practicing
Jew, etc. The answer is no. The &quot;one god&quot; religions reject other paths besides their
own, including each other's. &quot;One-god&quot; religions also do not exalt the Female as does
Wicca, and mixing two such different traditions would water them both down. Besides, you'd have
to ask how serious a person who practiced two religions was about either one. Being Jewish is an
exception, since it is a race and culture as well as a religion. There are many Wiccan Jews, but
they practice Wicca, not Judaism.</p>

<h3>Magick and Science</h3>

<p>People interested in Wicca are usually curious about the magick that Wiccans can do. While
magick (spelled with a &quot;k&quot; to distinguish from stage conjuring) is not a religion in
itself, it is related to our religious beliefs. Wiccans believe that people have many more
abilities than are generally realized, and that it is a good idea to develop them. Our magick is
a way of using natural forces to change consciousness and material conditions as an expression of
our &quot;True Wills&quot;. Part of becoming a Wiccan is training in our methods of psychic and
magickal development.</p>

<p>Because we believe that everything a person does returns to them magnified, a Wiccan will not
work a magick for harm, since they would pay too high a price. But a helpful magick is good for
both the giver and receiver! Wicca is entirely compatible with the scientific method, and we
believe all the Gods and forces we work with to be quite natural, not supernatural at all. We do
not, however, hold with the kind of scientific dogma or pseudo religion that sees everything as
dead matter and neglects its own method by trumpeting &quot;facts&quot; without honest
examination of evidence.</p>

<h3>Priestesses at Large?</h3>

<p>Long ago the spiritual (and sometimes physical) ancestors of Wiccans were Priestesses and
Priests to the Pagan culture as well as devotees of their Mystery. Now that a Pagan culture is
rising again, some ask if today's Wiccans could resume that role. This seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Today's Pagan culture is very diverse and more interested in exploring and creating new forms
than in building on existing traditions. A public role would either dilute our traditions or
force them on an unwilling audience. The neo-Pagan community generally prefers &quot;media
figures&quot; and rapid membership and growth. This is not compatible with our slow methods of
training and Initiation, the insistence that livelihood come from work outside the Craft, or our
needs for privacy. Our religion is not accepted in the American workplace or political system,
and may never be. The most powerful Priestesses are often unknown to all but their Coveners.
While all Wiccans are Pagans, all Pagans are not Wiccan, and it is best that it remain so.</p>
