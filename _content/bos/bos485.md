                                A BOWHUNTER'S PRAYER TO DIANA

                              Oh Silvery Huntress of the Night!
                                Diana of the pale moonlight!
                                Oh Goddess of the Silver Bow
                              Smile on your humble child, below
                               Come now to me and be my guest,
                             And aid me in this hunt...my quest!

                               In this endeavor, grant success
                             Grant me patience - grant kindness
                             Watch over me and guide my steps -
                             As I walk into the forest's depths.
                                 Protect me from all injury
                               And close beside me, always be.

                                 Aid me as I track the deer
                          Through brush and thickets, far and near
                              When it comes time to draw my bow
                                Grant me accuracy, here below
                            Guide my arrows with speed and skill
                           Grant painless death and swiftest kill

                            Silvery Huntress, I am your child...
                             I hunt your forests, free and wild.
                               Bless this hunt, I ask of thee
                                Oh Great Diana, hear my plea
                             Goddess of Wild Ones and the Night!
                              Bless my table with food tonight!

              Kalioppe

                                                                                2248
