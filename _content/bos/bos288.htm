                  The Wishing Well -or - Releasing The Butterfly of Chaos 

                                     Frater Choronzon



          The general function of a Wishing Well is understood from an early

          age by most people. The user projects some required outcome of

          events, or &quot;wish&quot; into the well, perhaps accompanied by a symbolic

          financial donation, and waits for events to take their course.

          Similar properties are attributed in popular tradition to acts of

          cutting a birthday cake and breaking a wish-bone while devouting

          certain species of poultry.



          In every sense, the act of making a wish using any of the above

          ritual props is a magical operation though experience suggest that

          Wells tend to be more effective than both chicken bones and all but

          the most esoterically decorated cakes in achieving the intended

          result.



          As of late, many Wishing Wells have been withdrawn from public

          access; and, moreover, recent opinion polls have indicated high

          levels of dissatisfaction with the scarcity of wish-fulfillment

          opportunities, particularly among vegetarians. This paper attempts

          some analysis of the dynamics involved in successful wish-making,

          and offers a ritual procedure which readers may find useful pending

          the launch of another &quot;Wishing Well Withdrawal&quot; from the public eye.

                                                                            1423

           

          Anyone who has studied non-linear dynamics (or Chaos Mathematics) as

          applied to the interaction of complex systems (for instance life-in-

          general) will be aware of the extreme sensivity of such systems to

          initial conditions. This is illustrated by the so called Butterfly

          Effect; a model of the process by which a butterfly flapping its

          wings on the Carribean Islands can set in train a series of

          atmospheric interactions which may culminate, after some elapsed

          time, in the occurence of a hurricane in London.



          The hypothesis in this context is that the ritual act of making a

          wish sets up initial conditions for a Chao/dynamic process which

          culminates, after some elapse time, in the occurrence of whatever

          event was the original objective of the wish; hence the subtitle

          &quot;Releasing the Butterfly of Chaos&quot;. Atmospheric effects are often

          synchronous with successful magickal operations as was observed, for

          example, by those who were present for (or within earshot of) the

          4,000 watt &quot;Enochian Verse Recital&quot; in South London, 17.30 Hrs,

          Monday, 28 May, 1990; but where magic is concerned the atmospherics

          are felt to be little more than by-products of casual sequence which

          is primarily electromagnetic in character.



          The actual process by which a successful wish is transformed into

          its outcome is, of course, magic; at least in the sense that modern

          TV receiver might be acknowledged as such by Agrippa or Abra-Melin

          the Mage - Was there ever a more effective acrostic &quot;for divers

          visions&quot; than an infrared remote control?

                                                                            1424

          A detailed explanation of how the magical process appears to work

          would fill a book (reasonable offers from reputable publishers

          accepted); suffice it to say that no rewrite of either the Laws of

          Physics or the Axioms of Mathematics is required, and to mention

          that the Astrological elements of the hypothesis will form the

          substance of a paper to be presented to a forth coming meeting of

          the &quot;Talking Stick&quot;.



          For the purpose of this exercise, the process may be appropriately

          visualized by consideration of nothing more complicated than a

          humble smoke-ring. In mathematical terms this is a Torus (a ring-

          doughnut shaped structure) which has a clearly defined, coherent and

          self-contained existence for an extended period within a

          fundamentally chaotic matrix; ie. it can hung around for several

          seconds retaining its structure in the turbulent air of a

          smoke-filled room. Such ordered structures fall quite naturally out

          of the Chaos Mathematics which models the behavior of gases and

          liquids (Fluid Dynamics for the technically inclined). Examples of

          such ordered structures in a chaotic environment abound, and not

          only on this planet. The Great Red Spot on Jupiter, for instance,

          has been in existence at least since Galileo observed it in 1610,

          though the chaotic nature of that planets atmosphere was not

          appreciated until the flypast of the Voyager spacecraft of 1979.

                                                                            1425

          A perfect smoke-ring requires very little expenditure of energy to

          be brought into existence, though that energy, in the form of a

          controlled pulse of gas projected from its creator lips has to be

          quite precise - ie. smoke-rings don`t always work, particular if

          someone is watching, and the best ones of all usually happen quite

          by accident! Significantly, the only way an observer can know if a

          smoke-ring is there because it has smoke in it. If an identical

          pulse of gas is projected from a non-smoker, the Toroidal ring

          structure will be established in the just the same way within the

          atmosphere, but its presence is almost impossible to detect, even

          with the most sophisticated of scientific instruments.



          The atmosphere is not the only chao/dynamic envelope surrounding our

          planet; there also exists the magnetosphere, which we perceive at

          ground level as the earths magnetic field. At present it exerts a

          force which causes a compass needle to point approximately towards

          the North Pole.



          The magnetosphere extends out into so-called empty space well beyond

          the atmosphere of the planet, and is anything but static in

          character. Complete polarity reversals can occur. A record of these

          is preserved in the sequence of North and South oriented volcanic

          rocks which have been mapped in the ocean floor extending outwards

          from mid-oceanic ridges, such as that which runs the lenght of the

          Atlantic. The magnetosphere exhibits its own &quot;weather&quot; patterns

          which, like the atmospheric weather, are driven primilarily by

          radiation from the Sun/Solar Winds. Magnetic and electric storms

          which affect TV and radio reception are a phenomena of

          magnetospheric weather, and interaction between the magnetosphere

          and the atmosphere can result in phenomena such as the Aurora

                                                                            1426

          Borealis or Northern Lights. Other manifestations include ball-

          lightning and St. Elmo`s fire.



          The ritual procedure put forward here postulates a process whereby a

          sudden pulse of electro-chemical energy, through an operators

          nervous system, establishes a magnetic structure which is the

          mathematical equivalent of a smoke-ring. It is suggested that this

          can occur on the onset of orgasm or accompanying a powerful

          martial-arts styled shout or KIAI, by a process akin to that of the

          Faraday Induction described in any half-decent textbook. The

          &quot;magical&quot; part of the process involves injecting a

          flash-visualisation of the eventual desired outcome of the magneto-

          smoke-ring as it is being established. The rest of the process of

          wish fulfillment is left to the wondrous dynamics of Chaos. It may

          be helpful for the operator to face towards the geographical

          (magnetic) North Pole.



          If performed as a solo working, this ritual may usefully be preceded

          by a banishing and visualisation exercise. The ritual text is

          written in the Enochian language of the angelic calls which were

          devised or discovered by Dr. John Dee in the 16th Century. In the

          sense that Enochian can be seen as a system of control (or cyber-)

          language for &quot;life, the universe, and everything&quot; it has many of the

          characteristics of a computer programming language. Among such

          properties would be those of recursive self-reference (ie. the

          ability to modify itself), and some of the phraseology of the

          preamble to the ritual is designed to apply ideas developed by

          Douglas Hoffstadter in his book Godel, Escher, Bach to the Enochian

          language. Specifically, the text of the ritual should increase its

          own potency with repetition.

                                                                            1427

          After the Enochian preamble, the participant(s) should make a

          vocalized statement of a &quot;wish&quot; or willed endpoint for the working,

          at the same time strongly visualizing the desired outcome. This

          &quot;wish&quot; may be of a benefic or malefic intent, but beware! the

          Enochian preamble carries a force of personal honor, in wishes of a

          dishonorable character they are likely to backfire.



          The pre-climatic mantrum &quot;Zarzas Zarzas Nasatanata Zarzas&quot; is held

          to be untranslatable. It is, by tradition, a formula which opens the

          Gates of Hell or the Abyss; in this context it is used to invoke the

          dynamic process of Chaos by which the wish can be fulfilled. Some

          occult authorities, Crowley among them, assert that the Zarzas

          formula is dangerous and advise against using it. Modern Chaos

          magicians do not share that view and, besides having employed it for

          years with no particular ills impacting the user, is consistently

          been found to enhance the effectiveness of most categories of

          magical working.



          The final climatic KIAI may be shout such as that projected by a

          martial arts practioner in the process of shattering a concrete

          block (or someone`s sternum), or else an exaggerated cry of orgasmic

          ecstasy. Prospective participants with orgiastic inclinations may

          care to experiment with variant techniques to effect the final KIAI

          exclamation which sets the magical &quot;butterfly effect&quot; process in

          motion. For example, the Enochian couplet following the statement of

          the wish might be committed to memory by operator of either gender,

          and repeated while other participants stimulate that operator to a

          frenzied pitch of ecstasy, culminating in the final KIAI. Such

          variants are for the more experimentaly inclined, but it is the sort

          of experiments which magicians of an unhibited frame of mind (or

                                                                            1428

          body) may find it enjoyable to carry out as an end in itself. Any

          feedback on results would be welcome!
