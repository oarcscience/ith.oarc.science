                   The Church of All Worlds, a Brief History 

         It all began on April 7, 1962, when, after reading Stranger in a
    Strange Land, Tim Zell and Lance Christie shared water and formed a
    water-brotherhood called "Atl" at Westminster College at Fulton,
    Missouri. During the mid-1960s the group was centered on the University
    of Oklahoma campus at Norman under the name Atlan Foundation. A
    periodical, The Atlan Torch (later The Atlan Annals), was published from
    1962-1968. Following a move to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1968 the Church
    of All Worlds was legally incorporated. In March of that year, the first
    issue of Green Egg appeared and over the years made Tim Zell, its
    editor, a major force in Neo-Paganism, a term which Zell coined. CAW was
    the first Neo-Pagan/Earth Religion to obtain full federal recognition,
    although it was initially refused recognition by the Missouri Department
    of Revenue on the basis of its lack of primary concern about the
    hereafter, God, the destiny of souls, heaven, hell, sin and its
    punishment, and other supernatural matters. The ruling was overturned as
    unconstitutional in 1971.     The Church of All Worlds took much
    inspiration from the science fiction classic, Stranger in a Strange Land
    by Robert Heinlein. In the novel, Valentine Michael Smith was a human
    being born on Mars and raised by Martians. Upon being brought to Earth,
    2519

    he established the Church of All Worlds, built around "nests", a
    combination of a congregations and an intentional communities. A basic
    concept was "grokking", i.e., the ability to be fully empathic.
    Heinlein's CAW emphasized non-possessive love and joyous expression of
    sexuality as divine union. Their greeting was "Thou art God" or "Thou
    art Goddess", a recognition of  immanent divinity in each person.     The basic theology of the CAW is a pantheism focused on immanent rather
    than transcendent divinity, which is worshiped in female as well as a
    male form. 

         The most important thealogical statement came in revelatory
    writings by Zell in 1970-73, on a theory which later came to be known as
    the Gaia Thesis, a biological validation of the ancient intuition that
    the planet is a single living organism, Mother Earth.       Pantheists
    hold as divine the living spirit of Nature. Thus the CAW recognizes
    Mother Earth, the Horned God, the Green Man and other spirits of
    animistic totemism as the Divine Pantheon. Church of All Worlds was an
    early forerunner of the Deep Ecology movement. Through its focus on
    Mother Nature as Goddess and its recognition and ordination of women as
    Priestesses, CAW can also rightly be held to be the first Eco-Feminist
    Church. Its only creed states: "The Church of All Worlds is dedicated to
    the celebration of life, the maximal actualization of human potential
    and the realization of ultimate individual freedom and personal
    responsibility in harmonious eco-psychic relationship with the total
    Biosphere of Holy Mother Earth."

         In 1974, CAW reported nests in Missouri, California, Illinois,
    Kansas, Wisconsin, Iowa, Wyoming, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
    New Jersey, New York, and Ohio. It was then publishing two periodicals,
    Green Egg and The Pagan. Two years later Zell moved to Oregon with his
    new wife, Morning Glory, an ordained Priestess, for a rural life of
    writing, research and the practice of the religion he had developed.
    They left the administration of the CAW and the publication of the Green
    Egg in the hands of other Church leaders. After only a few more issues,
    the magazine ceased publication. Subsequently many Church Nests
    dissolved due to internal conflicts.

         By the mid-1980s CAW survived only in California, focused around
    the sanctuary land bequeathed to the Church by its Bard, Gwydion
    Pendderwen. On and around this rural retreat, a Pagan homesteading
    community grew which included the Zells (Tim Zell had changed his first
    name to Otter in 1979 following a vision quest) and other long-time
    Church members who had moved to California, as well as many new people.
    Two new clergy were ordained during that time, Orion Stormcrow (a Church
    member since 1969) and Anodea Judith. (In 1991, Deborah Hamouris was
    ordained, bringing the present number of active clergy to six.)  In the
    late 1980s, following Otter and Morning Glory's emergence from eight
    years of living in the wilderness, the Church of All Worlds began
    reorganizing under the leadership of Anodea Judith. The membership
    program was radically upgraded to include a Progressive Involvement
    Program (PIP), intensive training courses and a new members newsletter,
    The Scarlet Flame. Activities and membership increased dramatically
    during this period as CAW emerged from its slumber.    The first issue
    of Green Egg (The Next Generation!) appeared in May, 1988, the 20th
    anniversary of its original publication. It has risen to a position of
    prominence among Pagan periodicals. Diane Darling, who joined the Church
    in the mid-'80s, is its editrix, Otter its publisher and designer. In
    1991, with 52 pages and a four-color glossy cover, Green Egg won the
    2520

    Silver Award from the Wiccan/Pagan Press Alliance (WPPA) for "Most
    Professionally Formatted Pagan Publication". In 1992 Green Egg won the
    WPPA Gold Award for "Readers' Choice" as well as the Dragonfest Awards
    for "Most Attractive Format" and "Best Graphics". Diane won the Pentacle
    Award for "Favorite Pagan Editrix", and Otter for "Favorite Pagan
    Writer".

         The non-fictional Church of All Worlds has grown far beyond
    Heinlein's dream. There are nine concentric circles of member involve-
    ment, named after the planets and grouped into three rings. Each
    circle's activity includes study, writings, magical training, sen-
    sitivity and encounter-group experience, as well as active participation
    in the life of the Church. The First Ring, Circles 1, 2, and 3, is for
    Seekers, those who are only participants. Second Ring, Circles 4 through
    6, is made up of Scions, members who help run the church.  The clergy,
    Council of the Third Ring, consists of legally ordained priests and
    priestesses; longtime members who have worked through the other circles,
    undergone personal and leadership development, religious training, and
    completed the Church's ordination requirements.   There are two
    governing bodies in addition to the Clergy: the Board of Directors,
    which determines policy and business matters, and the Fun Committee,
    which implements the activities and functions of the Church. The Fun
    Committee is made up of a Board member, a clergy member, and one
    representative from each of the church functions, such as Rites and
    Festivals, Publications, Membership, Communications and each subsidiary.
    There is an annual General Meeting to elect officers and make changes in
    the Church's ever-evolving Bylaws. Worship involves attending weekly or
    monthly Nest meetings usually held in the homes of Nest members.
    Autonomous nests are composed of at least three members of 2nd Circle
    meeting monthly or more often. The basic liturgical form is based on a
    circle where a chalice of water is shared around as part of the ritual
    part of the Nest meeting.     Longer events are celebrated at the Church
    sanctuary, Annwfn, a 55-acres of land in northern California. Annwfn has
    a two-story temple, cabins, garden, orchard and a small pond. It is
    maintained by a small community of resident caretakers.  In addition to
    the eight Celtic seasonal festivals, the Church holds handfastings
    (marriages), vision quests, initiations, workshops, retreats, work
    parties and meetings on the land.  As of 1993, the Church has ten
    chartered nests in California, with others in Florida, Illinois,
    Arizona, Maryland, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Australia (where CAW has
    become the first legally-incorporated Pagan church in that country). A
    number of proto-Nests are in the process of forming.  Current President
    is priest Tom Williams (a member since 1968).  Otter is presently
    engaged in the formation of the Universal Federation of Pagans (UFP), a
    worldwide association with which he hopes to unify the global Pagan
    community.  1992 was the 30th anniversary of the Church. A Grand
    Convocation was held in August, with an attendance of nearly 300.
    Membership at the end of 1993 was around 600.
