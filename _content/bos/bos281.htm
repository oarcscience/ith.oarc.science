                         Practical Applications of the Chaossphere 

                                    by Fra.: Neonfaust 

           

          The Chaossphere is the prime working tool of Chaos magicians and the 

          Magical Pact of the Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT). The physical 

          Chaossphere has a vast range of applications of which a few shall be 

          briefly delineated here: 

           

          Meditation employing the Chaossphere: 

          1, The Chaossphere is a symbol of the primeval Big Bang, it maybe 

          considered as a &quot;frozen explosion&quot; or even as &quot;frozen information&quot;. 

          Regard the Chaossphere in a relaxed state, using the 180* stare if 

          you prefer. After a while shut your eyes and meditate on the 

          creative powers of Chaos. Chaos is not disorder let alone entropy 

          but rather the sum total of all possibillities incumbent in 

          existence and the unmanifest as a whole. In this manner you will 

          open the doors to the magickal multiversum for yourself. 

          2, Proceed as described above simultaneously meditating on 

          Nietzsches Zarathustra admonition: 

          &quot;I say unto you: a man must have chaos yet within him to be able to 

          give birth to a dancing star. I say unto you: ye have chaos yet 

          within you.&quot; 

          You can have this statement read aloud to you by a partner or friend 

          during your meditation (or use a cassette recording). Experience 

          shows that this will greatly enhance the effect described above 

          under item number 1. 

           








                                           1392

          Sigil charging employing the Chaossphere: 

               In lieu of other charging techniques you can project the magickal

          sigil activation into the Chaossphere; banishing (preferably by 

          laughter) should follow immediately. Afterwards aim to forget the 

          whole magickal operation as thoroughly as possible to avoid 

          interference with the sigil`s operation by the unwanted rise of 

          consciousness of said operation/sigil and resultant inhibiting 

          psychic censor activity. 

           

          Drawing energy employing the Chaossphere: 

               To be  performed preferably  after a  meditation with  the Chaos-

          sphere  (see above); regard the Chaossphere in a very intensive manner

          for a  while and stretch your  palms in its direction.  Now close your

          eyes fully  or halfway and  suck in the  powers of Chaos  through your

          palms while inhaling;  exhaling, distribute the energies all over your

          body  or store them  in the  Hara centre  (appr. three  fingers` width

          below the navel).  You will  probably experience these  energies as  a

          warm or cool current, possibly as a slightly tingling sensation. 

           

          Telepathy employing the Chaossphere: 

               During a partner experiment participants concentrate on the 

          Chaossphere (can also be performed with different participants 

          working on different locations); observe in a very relaxed state 

          messages, information and/or images rising from the unconscious. 

          Advanced magicians will find that this experiment can be performed 

          successfully via great distances even without participants 

          practising simultaneously. For Chaos (= pure information) is not 

          restricted by space and time. 






                                           1393

          Astral projection and lucid dreaming employing the Chaossphere: 

               1,  Using the  180* stare  regard the  Chaossphere until  you ex-

          perience a strong suction emerging from the sphere and pulling at your

          &quot;psychic entrails&quot;. This can frequently even be felt as a strong 

          physical sensation. Give way to this suction and let your astral 

          body emerge gradually. In the beginning this should be practised 

          partially, ie. the astral body portion extracted increasing with 

          every subsequent attempt. Thus, you may for example only project 

          half an arm the first time, the full at the next go etc. Finally the 

          astral body should emerge totally. Be aware that astral projection 

          may demand weeks` or months`  dedicated practice to succeed, depending

          on personal  talent and inhibitions. Incidentally,  the same technique

          may be  used to  extract the  magickal doppelganger,  personal daemons

          etc. 



               2, Immediately before dropping off to sleep visualize the 

          Chaossphere as accurately as possible and continue as described 

          above. This will induce either stronger astral projection or lucid 

          dreaming or both. This has proved to be an extremely powerful 

          exercise, but it is strongly suggested that you attempt it only 

          after having acquired a thorough working knowledge with the variaant 

          described above under item 1. (If you start off with mental working 

          chances are that you will very soon become severely sloppy without 

          even being aware of the fact; this may in turn inhibit control of 

          magickal powers and could lead to obsession.) You may also want to 

          wake yourself up at 4 a.m. and give this exercise a try for a few 

          minutes before dropping off to sleep again. Take care to note your 

          dreams next thing in the morning, do not - repeat: DO NOT! - rely on 

          your memory alone. 

           


                                           1394

          Activating psychogones/chaoservitors employing the Chaossphere: 

               Use the Chaossphere as a &quot;base camp&quot; and &quot;home&quot; for psychogones/-

          chaoservitors and/or  as a  form of &quot;launching  pad&quot;. In  case of  the

          former  the Chaossphere presents itself  as a high  class power recep-

          tacle  and storage  battery from  which you  can extract  your psycho-

          gones/chaoservitors  into the Chaossphere as  you would with sigils to

          be activated; thus,  the Chaossphere will become a gate  to the Sphere

          of Chaos  for your magickal  entities in which  (and from  which) they

          will become active in accord with your bidding. 

           

          Charging magical objects employing Chaossphere: 

               Magical objects such as talismans, amulets, fetishes etc. can be 

          charged with the aid of the Chaossphere by fastening them to the 

          sphere or its tip during a ritual, placing them under it etc. while 

          directing the energies of Chaos into the objects in question. 

           

          Combat magic training employing the Chaossphere: 

               During combat magical training the Chaossphere is particularly 

          suited as a power storage battery out of which the magician draws 

          Magis or Mana. It is furthermore used as a combat target while 

          practising the kiai or other battle cries and martial arts Chi 

          techniques. In the same manner, magickal energy bolts, curses, words 

          of powers and strong affections are hurled emphatically into the 

          Chaossphere where they may be stored for further use. 

           












                                           1395

          Charging the Chaossphere: 

               Experience  has shown  that  the Chaossphere  does  not demand  a

          special 

          charging by ritual etc. Rather, the charging takes place alone by 

          its practical application. Should you desire to incorporate magickal 

          &quot;condensator&quot; fluids or solids (eg. as used for charging magickal 

          mirrors) this can easily be achieved by unscrewing the tips and 

          replacing them after filling in the condensator.
