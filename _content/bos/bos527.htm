                   THE REAL OLD TIME RELIGION
                   tune: &quot;Old Time Religion&quot;
                                        
       (Chorus): Give me that real old time religion (3X)
                 It's good enough for me!
                                        
                         ASATRU AND ODINISM:                              
                                         
I hear Valkyries a-comin                One-eyed Odin we will follow           
In the air their song is comin          And in fighting we will wallow         
They forgot the words! They're hummin!  Till we wind up in Valhallow           
But they're good enough for me!         Which is good enough for me!           
                                                                               
We will drive up to Valhalla         It was good enough for Odin            
Riding Beetles, not Impalas          Though the tremblin' got forbodin'     
Singing &quot;Deutschland Uber Alles&quot;     Then the giants finally strode in,     
And that's good enough for me!       But it's good enough for me!
                                                                           
It was good enough for Loki          Shall we sing a verse for Thor,        
It was good enough for Loki          Though he leaves the maidens sore?     
He thinks Thor's a little hokey      They always come back for more,        
And that's good enough for me!       So he's good enough for me!            
                                        
Shall we sing in praise of Loki,     It was good for Thor and Odin          
Though he left poor Midgard smokey?  It was good for Thor and Odin          
Oh, his sense of humor's hokey,      Grab an axe and get your woad on!      
But he's good enough for me!         and it's good enough for me!           
                                                                              
All the Gods tore into Loki        We will worship now with vigor            
Saying Deicide is hokey!           The goddess known as Frigga               
And they threw him in the pokey!   Tho there are some who don't dig her      
And that's good enough for me!     She is good enough for me!                
                                                                    
Good old Thor's the god of thunder   If you wanna worship Odin 
Really helps us get our plunder      You don't have to have a coat on 
Tho his head's still truly dunder    Grab a sword and slap some woad on  
He is good enough for me!            And that's good enough for me! 
                                        
In the halls of Frey and Freyja          We will sing a verse for Loki     
All the priestesses will lay ya          He's the old Norse god of Chaos
If you're good enough, they'll pay ya!   Which is why this verse don't          
And that's good enough for me!             rhyme or scan or nothin'         
                                         But it's good enough for me...    
                                        
                                BRUJA:  
                                        
                     Let us sing for Brujaria                       
                     Though the blood's a lot less cleaner;
                     It's not Christian Santaria             
                     So it's good enough for me!         

                                                                            2320


                               BUDDHISM:                                        
                                        
We will all go to Nirvana               Oh we all will follow Buddah           
So be sure to mind your manners         Oh we all will follow Buddah           
Make a left turn at Savannah            And we'll eat no food but Gouda        
And we'll see the Promised Land!        Which is Gouda-nuff for me!
                                        

It was good enough for Buddha,          We will go and sing &quot;Hosanna&quot;          
As a god he's kinda cute-a,             To our good ol' pal, Gautama,          
And he comes in brass or pewta'         He will never flim or flam ya',        
So he's good enough for me!             And that's good enough for me!         
                                                                               
No one wrote a verse for Buddah      We will all go to Nirvana         
Tho I think they really coulda       We will all go to Nirvana         
And I really think they shoulda      Make a left turn at Urbana         
'Cause he's good enough for me!      And you'll see the Promised Land!      
                                        
                       CARGO CULT &amp; PACIFIC ISLANDS:             
                                        
To the tune of Handel's &quot;Largo&quot;       If you get too tired           
We will hymn the gods of Cargo        And you need to get up higher    
'Til they slap on an embargo          Just have Pele light your fire!    
And that's good enough for me!        From her island in the sea!     
                                           
                You can keep your saints with halos,
                Your hosannas or dayenus:
                Let's throw virgins in volcanos!
                And that's good enough for me!
                                        
                               CHRISTIAN:                      
                                                 
We will worship with the Fundies      There are those who worship Satan      
With their itchy hair-shirt undies    And are just anticipatin'              
If they don't bring &quot;Mrs. Grundy,&quot;    Armageddon's conflagratin'             
Then it's good enough for me!         That ain't good enough for me!         
                                                                               
It was good for old Jehovah         Let's all listen up to Jesus           
He had a son who was a nova!        He says rich folks like old Croesus    
Hey there, Mithras! Move on ova'!   Will be damned until Hell freezes      
Another resurrection Day!           And that don't sound good to me!
                                                                               
Jerry Falwell thinks he's sav-ed        Oh we'll all be Fundamental            
In a lamb's blood he's been lav-ed      And be Holy Testamental                
And HE thinks that I'M deprav-ed        And never Trancendental                
But that's good enough for me!          And that's good enough for me!         
                                                                               
That Bob Larson shrieks and hollers    We will finally pray to Jesus
Fighting demons in his callers         From our sins we hope he frees us     
Save his program: SEND YOUR DOLLARS!   Eternal life he guarantees us         
And that's good enough for me!         And that's good enough for me!         
                                        
Tho J.C.'s into fish, too,            Anytime that I start hearin'     
He's an avatar of Vishnu              &quot;Jesus loves you&quot; I start leerin'
So he is welcome here, too,           Maybe so, but not like Brian *
And that's good enough for me!        Which is good enough for me!  

                                                                            2321

                                        
Brother Jerry is a cretin             Brother Oral's in his tower,
But with all the cash he's gettin'    Trusting in the Lord's power
Lotsa folks'll be forgettin           Getting richer by the hour,
It's the &quot;Land of the Free!&quot;          Now he's got the ransom fee!
                                        
Brother Robert's church is Crystal     Brother Earnest is a healer
But all the Bible that he's missed'll  And not QUITE a wheeler-dealer --
Make you &quot;hotter than a pistol&quot;        More a jumper and a squealer
But he's good enough for me!           So he's good enough for me!
                                        
Brother Jim and Sister Tammy       Then there's good ol' Brother Billy
Had a show that was a whammy       Bringing souls in willy-nilly.
But now they are in Miami          All his trips are kinda silly,
Tryin' t'get back on TV!           But he's good enough for me!
                                        
Whether Low Church or it's High Church  And the Romans said of Jesus
Or it's Pie-Up-In-The-Sky Church        &quot;Lets kill him, he don't please us&quot;
Come on down and visit my Church        &quot;But the Atheists will tease us&quot;
'Cause it's good enough for me!         And thats good enough for me
                                        
You could join Jehovah's Witness             And let's not forget Pelagius
Running door to door for fitness             Though some call him outrageous
Well if you've been blessed with quickness,  He is pious and courageous
Then thats good enough for me                And he's good enough for me!

We will go to worship Zeus           You can dance and wave the thyrsos     
Though his morals are quite loose    And sing lots of rowdy verses          
He gave Leda quite a goose           Till the neighbors holler curses,      
And he's good enough for me!         And that's good enough for me!
                                        
We will pray to Father Zeus           We will sing for great Diana           
In his temple we'll hang loose        Who will teach of love and honor       
Eating roast beef au jus,             But you really gotta wanna!            
And that's good enough for me!        'Cause she's tough enough for me!      
                                                                               
Shall we sing a verse for Venus,   We went off to worship Venus
Of the Gods she is the meanest,    By the Gods! You should have seen us!   
Cause she bit me on my...elbow!    Now the Clinic has to screen us...
And it's good enough for me!       But that's good enough for me! 
                                        
We will venerate old Bacchus               It was good enough for Sappho
Drinking beer and eating tacos             With her lady on her lap-o 
Til you've tried it please don't knock us  She put Lesbos on the map-o
'Cause it's good enough for me!            With her pagan poetry!
                                        
Let us raise a toast to Bacchus,       When we worship Bacchus            
We will raise a royal ruckus,          The ethanol will sock us           
Then we'll lay us down and f**k us     We'll all get good and raucous     
That's good enough for me!             And that's good enough for me!     
                                        
Diana is a little spikey           We'll sing praises to Apollo;   
And she is a little dyke-ey        Where the Sun God leads we'll follow   
You don't have to be a Psych-e     ('Though his head's a little hollow)
To know that's right for me!       He's good enough for me! 

                                                                            2322

We will worship with Poseidon         Don't neglect that shrine of Zeus'   
We will meet him when the tide's in   Tho he's lost his vital juices    
All the maidens he will ride in       The old boy still has his uses    
Then he'll give 'em all to me!        And he's good enough for me!    
                                        
All the hunters start convergin'      We will all bow to Hephaestus 
When Diana is emergin'                As a blacksmith he will test us  
It's too bad she's still a virgin     'Cause his balls are pure asbestos
But there's still hope left for me!   So he's good enough for me!  

And what about this Bacchus,          There is room enough in Hades          
Who lives just to raise a ruckus?     For lots of criminals and shadies      
Loosens women so they'll f**k us,     And disreputable ladies,               
Well, that's good enough for me!      And they're good enough for me!
                                                                               
We will all see Aphrodite             And to help things get real racous
Though she's pretty wild and flighty  The priests of Pan and Bacchus
She will meet us in her nightie       Will hold a f***ing contest!
And she's good enough for me!         And that's all right with me!
                                                                               
Oh we will go and worship Pan,          
'cause he just don't give a damn!       
Grab a woman or a man,                  
And that's good enough for me!          
                                                 
Was a time, so I've heard tell, a       We all worshipped Dionysus             
Fine and promising young fella          'Till we ran into a crisis:            
Gave his all to serve Cybele            The bar had raised its prices;         
But that's damn well not for me!        That's not good enough for me!         
                                                                               
We'll sing praises to Apollo            There's that lusty old Priapus         
Where the Sun-God leads, I'll follow    He's just itching to unwrap us.        
From Ionia to Gaul-o                    (He'd do more to us than tap us        
And that's good enough for me!          And that's good enough for me!)        
                                        
We will have a mighty Party          Pan's pipes got plugged last summer     
In the honor of Astarte              And it really was a bummer     
Grab your chiton - don't be tardy    Finally had to call a plumber!     
'Cause she's good enough for me!     But he's good enough for me!       
                                        
In his dancing Pan will lead them       Now Danae was sweet as flowers,
When his pipes call we will heed them   She was into golden showers;   
In truth tho, he don't need them        And that showed her Zeus' power
He's more than enough for me!           And that's good enough for me!
                                        
It was good enough for Venus           We will sing our staves to Venus
She'd have sighed if she'd of seen us  We will sing our staves to Venus
Letting morals come between us         Tho I think this rhyme is henious
And she's good enough for me!          But it's good enough for me!
                                        
There's one thing that I do know      Let us dance with Dionysus                
Zeus' favorite is Juno                And get drunk on wine and spices          
She's the best at doing...you know!   The Christians call them &quot;vices&quot;   
And that's good enough for me!        But they're good enough for me!           
                                           
It was good enough for Cupid       We will venerate old Hermes               
It was good enough for Cupid       With his staff entwined with wormies      
His wings look kind of stupid      Warding off the nasty germies             
But that's good enough for me!     And that's good enough for me!

Let's all drink to Dionysus        We will all bow down to Venus

He made a Maenad out of my Sis!    We will worship with our....voice  
And that's good enough for me!     And that's good enough for me!     
                                        
There are those who, when they've got e-   
Normous problems that are knotty           
They just take them to Hecate           We all worship Aphrodite,  
And that's good enough for me!          And Her sister bold Astarte,     
                                        They both throw a lovely party,  
In the church of Aphrodite              And that's just fine with me!  
She's a mighty righteous sightie,       
The Priestess wears a see through nightie
And she's good enough for me

Let us read works of Confucius         We used to study old Confucius
As we walk thru Massachusetts          As we sat there on our tushes
In white robes that freeze our tushes  We're learning but don't push us
But it's good enough for me!           And thats good enough for me

Of the Old Ones, none is vaster      Well it's good enough for   *
Even Cthulhu's not his master        He's a mighty kinky master  
I refer to the unspeakable   *       When you pray he goes much faster 
and that's good enough for me!       And that's good enough for me!

Let us sing to old Discordia            Of Great Murphy much is spoken         
Cause it's sure she's never bored ya    For his Law shall not be broken        
And if she's good enough for ya         It's not pretty when he's woken        
Then she's good enough for me!          Things go wrong for you and me!        
                                        
If your rising sign is Aries         If your god of choice is Squat         
You'll be taken by the Fairies       Well then trendy, man, you're not!

Oh, the dollar is our Saviour     There are those who scream and holler 
If we spend Her or we save Her    And get hot under the collar
She controls all our behaviour    For their god, Almighty Dollar,
There's not enough for me!        Who is good enough for me!

             Easy living from -your- follah-
             -wers, but sorry, -not- from me!

We will worship like the Druids,     In Pwyll's hall you will be welcome
Drinking strange fermented fluids,   But he's not at home too often      
Running naked through the woo-ids,   Spends all his time in Annwyfn  
Coz that's good enough for me!       And that's good enough for me!

             And I'll wear it where it tickles

Which is good enough for me!           Then it's good enough for me!     
                                                                         
Here's an invitation for us            We will venerate Bubastis        
All to go and worship Horus            Cause my cat walked up and ast us

             They're just funnin', they don't hate-cher 
             And they're good enough for me!               
                                        
                          ZARATHUSTRIAN:                                    
                                                                               
We will pray to Zarathustra        It could be that you're a Parsi            
And we'll pray just like we usta   It could be that you're a Parsi            
I'm a Zarathustra boosta!          Don't need a ticket; you get in free       
And that's good enough for me!     And that's good enough for me!             
                                           
I pray to Ahura-Mazda                  I can't rhyme Ahura Mazda, 
He's one god who sure won't pause ta   I'll praise the man who tries ta
Pound some heads when given cause ta   Then I'll wait for Barak Raz ta
Which is good enough for me!           And that's good enough for me!    
                                        
              UNCLASSIFIABLE VERSES AND UNKNOWN GHODS:
                                        
We will go down to the temple     There are those who worship no gods  
Sit on mats woven of hemp-le      For they think that there are low odds  
Try to set a good &quot;exemple&quot;       That the god-seers aren't drunk sods  
And that's good enough for me!    But they're good enough for me!
                                            
Let us watch Ka-ka-pa-ull        Where's the gong gone? I can't find it 
Frolic in her swimming pool      I think Northwoods is behind it!  
Subjecting chaos to her rule     For they've always been cymbal-minded       
And that's all right with me!    And they're good enough for me! 

                                                                            2330

                                                                              
They revered ancient ENIAC            Some folks pray to the Orishas           
And sacrificed to UNIVAC              Tho their humor can be vishas         
Now we sing our chants on VAX pack    When they grant your stupid wishas        
And that's good enough for me!        But they're good enough for me!        

When you worship Rusto             There are those who worship science   
Treat your friends with lust-o     And some would send 'em to the lions   
Pursue your faith with gusto!      Without 'em we'd have no appliance   
And that's good enough for me!     So they're good enough for me   
                                        
                 We will all bow down to Gozer                
                 Priestess did it with that Joser             
                 Cross the streams, and there she goes, sir   
                 And that's good enough for me!               
                                        
We will worship Christian Jesus       Drink to FUFLUNS he's just fine     
And do just like John Paul pleases    The Etruscan god of wine        
That we will... when Hades freezes!   This verse doesn't really rhyme     
And that's good enough for me!        But it's good enough for me!       
                                        
I have got a strange religion         John, Paul, George and Ringo
I will worship Walter Pidgeon         We will worship playing Bingo
Is he sacred? Just a smidgen!         We will listen to them sing-o
But it's good enough for me!          And that's good enough for me!

                    THE OBLIGATORY LAST VERSE                                   
                                                                                
                  It's the opera written for us!                                
                  We will all join in the chorus!                               
                  It's the opera about Boris,                                   
                  Which is Godunov for me!

  I suppose that this last song has turned you into a newt by now.
  You may not realize that it happened, 'cause that's just how that
  sort of thing seems to work. You need to put a carrot on your nose
  and find a duck, and weigh it. Then you'll be OK again.
