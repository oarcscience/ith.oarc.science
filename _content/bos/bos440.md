                                        WCC BELTANE RITUAL  
                                        By Lynna Landstreet


              Personnel required:

                  Several drummers and other musicians if possible. A priest and
                      priestess  who will represent the God & Goddess (and should be
              garbed
                  appropriately), referred to herein as P & PS, plus a priest or
                      priestess who will read  the meditation and "stage-manage" the
              ritual
                  (referred to herein as "N" for Narrator)

              Tools/Supplies required:

                      Very few. Thereshould be afire in the centreof the circle,and 
                a chalice of wine and a bowl of Nine Holy Herbs spray or other
                  concentrated alcohol (we ended up using Jamaican overproof rum,
                  which worked very well -- flared up about six feet high!).

              Bring in the people and have them sit. Have the musicians sit together
              in  an inner semi-circle, behind  the Narrator. One  drummer should be
              playing  a  slow, hypnotic  heartbeat during  the  first party  of the
              ritual.  The priest  and  priestess who  will  represent the  God  and
              Goddess should be hiding near  the circle, and approach when the  part
              about them drawing near begins.

              N:   "Beltane means many things.  It is a celebration of spring coming
              into full  flower, of the return  of the Goddess from  the underworld,
              the
              mating time of the animals, the return of the sun, and many other
              things. Above all, it is a celebration of life. But for us, here in
              this community, it is also the time when we leave the confines of our
              building and return to the temple of the forest.
                  "Wicca is a nature religion, but too often we worship in concrete
              cages, cut off from that nature, and from our own natures. And as we
              have now returned to nature in our choice of ritual site, I ask you
              tonight to return to  nature in your hearts and minds as well, for the
              ways of  the world within  walls are not  necessarily the same  as the
              ways of the world outside.
                      "We meet in a small fragment of forest, within acity park. But
              now, I  ask you to forget the  city that surrounds us.  In your mind's
              eye, let the  city fade away and the forest extend on and on, covering
              the  land that  only moments ago  was buried under  concrete. For once
              this land was wild,  and covered with trees,  not buildings. Once  the
              rivers and streams ran free,  and the air was fresh and  fragrant with
              the  scent of  cedar and  sweet fern,  not fouled  by car  exhaust and
              factory  smoke. And it may  be that one  day, it will be  so again, we
              have no way of knowing.
                      "But for now, picture the forest extending on and on,as far as
              you
              can imagine, in all directions. The great wild forest surrounds and
              embraces us, and we are the people of the forest.
                      "Herein the greatwild forest, we haveno need ofa sword to cast

                                               1936
              


              the circle,  for we have each other, our hands, our minds, our bodies.
              Join  hands, and breathe in deeply, and  breathe out, as one. Feel the
              circle being formed now by our  touch, the energy leaping from hand to
              hand, deosil,  around the circle.  Feel it forming, a  place set apart
              from the trials of daily life, a sacred, wild place...
                      "Here in the great wild forest, we have no  need of a besom to
              cleanse our circle, for  we meet in the  wilderness, which is  already
              clean and pure, and by its touch are we made clean and pure ourselves.
              Feel all fears, doubts and  negativities ebbing away from you, as  the
              forest absorbs them and transforms them to good...
                      "Here in the great wild forest, we have no need  of incense to
              purify
              our  circle, for  we have  the arching  sky above  our grove,  and the
              rushing
              wind that ruffles our hair and caresses our skin.  Breathe deeply, and
              take the wind  and the sky into  yourself. The spirits of  the air are
              here
              always,  it is  we who  have  come to  their place.  Greet them,  now,
              silently, in your own way...
                      "Here in the great wild forest, we have no need of a candle to
              purify  our circle,  for we  have the  balefire in  the centre  of our
              circle,  and the stars above.  See the leaping  flames now, hear their
              crackle, and see them reflected in the tiny fires in the sky above us.
              Feel their  warmth, and take  them into  yourself. The spirits  of the
              fire are  here always, it  is we who  have come to  their place. Greet
              them, now, silently, in your own way...
                  "Here in the great wild forest, we have no need of a water bowl to
              purify our circle, for we have the rushing stream in the valley beside
              us,  and the dew that moistens the  grass. Hear the water's call, now,
              feel the  rising dampness in the  air, and take it  into yourself. The
              spirits of the water are  here always, it is we who have come to their
              place. Greet them, now, silently, in your own way...
                      "Herein the great wildforest, we have no needof salt to purify
              our circle, for we have the earth itself, beneath us, and the firmness
              of our  own flesh and bones.  Feel the solidity, the  vastness, of the
              earth, and  take it into yourself.  The spirits of the  earth are here
              always,  it  is we  who have  come to  their  place. Greet  them, now,
              silently, in your own way...
                      "Open yourself, now, to the pulseof life all around you. It is
              there, if you can free your spirit  enough to sense it. Feel the  life
              straining to be born in every  sprouting seed, the exhilaration of the
              blossoms bursting  from their buds on  the trees, the joy  of the very
              grass  itself, of  every bush and  shrub and  piece of  moss, greening
              again as the earth is warmed by the sun, as the life-giving rains fall
              from the sky, and all  of nature is borne  into the ecstatic dance  of
              life's return. And feel,  in the midst of it all, the  presence of the
              Lord and  Lady, who are the  soul of all nature,  the consciousness of
              the  wild, the beauty of the green earth,  the sun and moon and stars,
              and the mystery  of the waters. Feel them  approaching! Even now, they
              near our circle, drawn by our love and our joy in their creation. Feel
              their power,  their nearness... they approach... they come... THEY ARE
              HERE!"

                      Narrator throws the Nine Holy Herbs into the fire. Asit flares
              up,
                      the drummersbegin todrum, and thepriest and priestessrepresen 
                    ting the God and Goddess runinto the circle and beginto dance   
                  wildly around the fire. After a couple ofrounds, they each pull   
                someone in from the circle to dancewith them a few rounds, then     
              each of the  four pull other people in, and so on, until the whole    

                                               1937
              


              circle is up and dancing (in high school they called this a snowball  
                dance, remember?).

                  As the dance reaches its peak, the priest and priestess take the
                      chalice,and hold it up above theheads of the dancers to charge
              it
                      (this ismade easier if yourcircle site is surroundedby park   
                    benches likeours is). If theenergy is really happening,a formal 
                    wineblessing shouldn't be necessary, butone may be performed    
                  anyway if desired. When the wine has beencharged, the narrator    
               calls "Down!" and people fall to the ground.

              N    "Feel the energy  swirling up and  up above  us, forming a  fiery
              cone.
              See it explode in a shower  of fireworks, the energy spiraling down to
              the earth like shooting stars, adding power to the transformation that
              is already underway, blending  with the energy  of every leaf and  bud
              and
              blossom  to aid in the  greening of the earth. (Pause)   Now rise, and
              join
              hands once again."

                      Priest and priestess take chalice around circle, and kiss each
              person before giving it to them, while people sing:

                      "Powers of the Earth
                      Powers taking form
                      Rising to rebirth,
                      Rising to be born."

                  When chalice returns, pour libation into the fire.

              N   "We need not bid farewell to our Gods, nor to the spirits that
              surround us,  the wind, the fire,  the stream, or the  earth, for they
              are
              always here. It is we  who shall take our leave of them, later on, and
              when we do, each of us  shall say our own farewell, in our  own words.
              But for now -- LET THE CELEBRATION BEGIN!!!"

                  People feast, dance, make merry, etc.
