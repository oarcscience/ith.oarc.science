                             ********************
                        A Witch's Thoughts on Halloween 
         Most people celebrate Halloween as a children's holiday of candy
    and costumes.  However, I will be celebrating tonight as Samhain 
    ("Sow-wen"), the Celtic New Year, the night for remembering loved ones
    past and looking toward the future. For I am a Neo-pagan, a follower of
    the Old Religion, a Wiccan.  I am a Witch.
         There are probably as many definitions of Wicca as there are prac-
    titioners of the Craft--one of the joys of this path is that there is no
    "one, true way"; intuition is as valuable as teaching.  This then is my
    personal definition of what Wicca is to me.
         First, what Wicca is not is devil-worship.  Wiccans don't believe
    in an entity of all-evil.  (I personally don't believe in evil per se; 
    all evil is simply a perversion or excess of something that is good when
    present in a proper balance.)
         Wicca is a religion based on experience of Deity as male and
    female.  It is pantheistic--seeing all things as part of God/dess, and
    seeing the Earth Herself as a living organism of whom we are part.  It
    is also a religion of immanence--seeing God/dess present in each of us
    and in the world around us, not "out there somewhere" but part of daily
    life.
         Wiccans celebrate eight major holidays, or sabbats--the beginning
    and midpoint of each season.  We also celebrate the phases of the moon: 
    some only celebrate the full moon while others celebrate full, waxing,
    and new moons.  Each of these rituals helps keep us in touch with
    Nature.  These celebrations are in small groups usually called circles,
    covens, or groves and are usually led by a Priestess, and often a
    Priest.  Some groups share duties and avoid titles.
         Wicca is also a "Craft".  We practice magic through chants,
    visualizations and spells, all to focus our will on something we want to
    happen.  We believe that everything we do, good or ill, comes back to us
    tripled, which is why we don't "hex" or "curse" anyone.  We also believe
    that many psychic talents are real and simply haven't been studied
    enough by science to be catalogued as such.
         Wiccans for the most part accept reincarnation, not as dogma to be
    believed, but as fact based on personal experience.  Many of us remember
    past lives.  As one who has studied science, I know that every atom of
    my body once was part of something else, and I am  continually losing
    atoms that become part of others.  Knowing this, it makes sense that my
    soul also is "recycled".
         Wicca is a positive philosophy.  The only "law" is 'An it harm
    none, do as ye will":  Enjoy life to its fullest, and remember to help
    everyone else enjoy it as well.  Wiccans don't preach; Wiccans don't
    evangelize.  Everyone has to find his/her own path, and we welcome the
    diversity this brings.
         So tonight, when you dress up as a "wicked witch", know that there
    are "good witches" celebrating as well.  Know that I and thousands like
    me throughout the world are celebrating the cycles of life through the
    dance of the Lord and the Lady, trying to make this world we all share
    a little brighter through our cauldron fires in the darkness.  Know we
    are not out to convert you;  know we mean you no harm.  All we ask for
    is understanding, tolerance, and the freedom to practice as we choose.

    Blessed Be,
