                                        Elemental Cauldrons 

                    Using a cauldron, symbol of inspiration and rebirth, has brought
              new dimensions  to both group and solitary work.  A cauldron decorates
              the  center of the Circle during Lesser Sabbats.  An air cauldron at a
              spring rite  creates a misty,  magical quality  for the ceremony.   In
              summer, the  cauldron  will flash  and  spark.   A  blue  flame  burns
              mysteriously  within the  Water cauldron  during the  autumn festival.
              Throughout  Yule, the  Earth  cauldron burns  steadfast and  constant.
              During moon  rites, when magick is  done, we write the  purpose of our
              working on flash papers and toss  them into the burning cauldron while
              chanting.
                    A  working cauldron should be of cast iron, with a tight-fitting
              lid,  three sturdy legs,  and a strong  handle.  Season  your cauldron
              before using it for the first time.  Pour in generous helping  of salt
              and lighter fluid, slosh it  up to the rim  and wipe dry.  For  indoor
              use it  MUST have a  fireproof base  or your workings  will summon  up
              yellow-coated salamander spirits from the fire department.

              EARTH Cauldron

                    Layer salt, wax shavings, three powered or ground herbs, fighter
              fluid and ivy leaves in the cauldron while focus and chanting.  Use  a
              candle to light  it.  When  the smoke starts  to roll, extinguish  the
              cauldron by putting the lid on.

              AIR Cauldron

                    Using tongs, put a  chunk of dry ice is a small glass or ceramic
              bowl  and place the  bowl on  a cloth in  the bottom of  the cauldron.
              Allow the  cauldron to  smoke as  long as the  ice lasts.   The  mists
              create excellent images for scrying.

              FIRE Cauldron

                    Cover theinside bottom with dirtor sand to dissipateheat.  Light
              incense  charcoal and  add either salt  petter for flame  and spark or
              flash powder for  a different  but spectacular effect.   To assist  in
              releasing or firing off peak energy, try using flash "bombs".   Make a
              small pocket in a piece of flash paper, fill with flash powder and tie
              with  thread.  The  "bomb" should be  about the size  of your smallest
              fingernail.  The results  are spectacularly bright, so use  the powder
              sparingly.  Don't look directly at the flash as you drop the "bomb" in
              the cauldron.

              WATER Cauldron.

                    At least seven days before the ritual, place equal quantities of
              three appropriate herbs in a pint glass jar.  Fill the rest of the jar
              with Everclear  (200 proof  alcohol),  cap tightly,  and shake  gently
              while concentrating on the purpose of the ritual.   Add a chant if its
              feels right.   Let the jar rest  in a dark, warm spot  and shake twice
              daily,  charging with purpose.   Before the ritual,  place a fireproof
              ceramic or  glass bowl  in the  cauldron.  Pour  in the  herb mixture,
              being careful none spills into  the cauldron.  Light with a  candle to
              produce a beautiful blue flame.

                    The  cauldron,   as  the  fifth   elemental  spirit,  symbolizes
              inspiration,  rebirth,  illumination and  rejuvenation.    Use a  Fire
              cauldron  with salt petter to cast a Circle.   Use the mists of an Air
              cauldron  for an initiation.   Burn away hate,  prejudice and negative
              self-images, with a Water cauldron.   The Earth cauldron is  ideal for
              indoor Beltane rites.
                    Remember to  place a  burning cauldron on  a fireproof  surface.
              Practice safety when using  any volatile materials and you  will enjoy
              your cauldron for many rites.
