          'Myth is what we call other people's religion.' 
                                                  --Joseph Campbell 
           
           
                  The following concordance isbased on 'Gods and FightingMen' by
          Lady Augusta Gregory, first published in 1904.  Page number references
          are to the  1976 trade  paperback edition published  by the  MacMillan
          Company of Canada Limited.  Brief supplementary material is taken from
          'Dictionary of Irish Myth  and Legend' by Ronan Coghlan,  published in
          1979 by Donard  Publishing Comapany,  and referenced as  'DIM' in  the
          following text. 
           
                  As this is intendedto be a concordanceof the Irishmythological
          cycle only (as opposed to heroic, legendary, or historical  material),
          references  are limited  to Part  I, Books  I -  V, of  Lady Gregory's
          volume.   'Gods and Fighting Men' was selected as the primary text for
          this  concordance  because   it  represents  the  most   comprehensive
          synthesis of variant sources (both published and oral)  ever attempted
          as a continuous narrative of Irish  mythology.  Lady Gregory lists her
          published sources as follows: 
           O'Curry, 'Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish' 
                   'MSS. Materials'
