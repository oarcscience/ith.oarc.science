                    THE LEGEND OF THE MAIDEN

                       The Mysts of Annwfn
                         Book of Shadows


     In Ages long past, the lovely Lady Brighid came to Hibernia
to dwell in that land among her people.  She brought to them many
special treasures from the Outer Realms to enrich their lives.
She gave them the art of Smithcraft, Poetry, and Inspiration.
Brighid also shared a sacred Cauldron that overflowed with
inspiration and love.  She was adept at the healing arts, and in
the Magick of Medicine.  Her people loved her deeply, and kindled
a fire in her honor which was constantly attended by nineteen
maidens, and was never allowed to go out.

     The Lady Brighid eventually became a mother, and her people
rejoiced, knowing their lands would be fruitful just as their
Goddess was fertile.  However, Brighid also knew the misery of
loss.  When one of her beloved sons was killed, the whole land
wept.  She lamented so deeply that she invented &quot;keening,&quot; the
mournful song of the bereaved women of Erin.  Her Flame burned so
brightly, however, that happiness soon returned to the land.  She
bestowed upon her people, yet, another gift:  The Art of
Whistling.

     However, in the fullness of time, the beloved Lady could no
longer dwell openly with her people, and she made her home in the
Sidhe.  There, she would dwell close to her people and her land,
and they could call upon her name at the appointed times, and
keep her Flame burning within their hearts.


              The Eternal Flame continues to burn!
