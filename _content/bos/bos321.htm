                                    Air Meditation

                    (taken from the WICCA echo on  Sun 24 Jan 93 22:17)

          It is dawn.  I find myself in a forest filled with Aspen trees.
          I raise my eyes and look for the sky, but the boughs looming
          overhead hide it from my view.  As I look up, feel the cool
          breeze of spring brush my face, and hear the sound of the
          rustling leaves.  Blowing, laughing from the east, Eurus brings
          thoughts of renewal and life.  I follow the wind further into the
          soft shadows of the forest, inhaling deeply the strong scent of
          the trees.  I smell, too, the wafting hints of fragrant incense.
          I follow where my senses lead me and come to a small clearing
          circled by burning censers filled with sweet-smelling oils.
          Toward the east end of the circle is a staff.  I walk over to the
          place and sit on the ground before it.  I take the staff into my
          hands and close my eyes.  First come swirling colors of white
          then yellow then fading darker into lavender.  Then, out of the
          swirling fog of colors come dozens of small, lithe figures who
          swirl around as if carried on the wind itself.  They dance around
          my head and body, swirling around as if caught in a dance to
          unheard music.  Then, taking my attention from the spirits of the
          air, I look up to find further figures emerging from the mist.
          First comes a woman with the beauty of the dawn. As she steps
          forward, each of the four winds, in turn, hasten from around here
          and fly, one to each of the four corners of the earth.  As she
          fades, there comes another whose form seems insubstantial, and
          seems to constitute both the image of a woman and a cow at the
          same time.  I look closely the attempt to solidify one form, but
          I cannot.  As this image fades, I am presented with the forms of
          two women who immediately remind me of the nighttime sky.  One
          glows with the pale light of the full moon, and her eyes hold the
          fullness of hidden knowledge.  The other, whom also seems to
          radiate cool starlight, seems to embody the possibilities of many
          lifetimes.  In due course, these figures too fade and I am left
          with only the mist of the elemental world of air.  Suddenly,
          three male figures issue from the mist. They seem to be three
          aspects of one man, but each's attributes differ.  The first
          glows with the light of the moon, seeming to be its protector.
          The second and third appear almost identical, except that one has
          a winged helmet and shoes.  As I sit and study the sameness and
          difference of the three, they begin to fade, as does the fog.
          When the mist clears, I find myself sitting within the circle
          still clutching the staff in my hands.  I place the staff once
          again on the ground and rise.  I thank the element of air, and
          all it is associated with for sharing with me its wisdom, and
          leave the circle.
