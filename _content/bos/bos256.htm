                                   SALEM REMEMBERED 
                                by Sandy and Doug Kopf 
                           presented at Pacific Circle XII 
                                      June, 1992 
          This year  is the 300th anniversary  of the Salem Witch  Trials.  This
          ritual was presented in remembrance of  those who died, and a reminder
          that we must be aware  and strong even now.   The  ritual was attended
          by over 100 people and was very moving.  Many wept. 
          It is being shared now, not only because it is  beautiful, but to make
          it available for others who might wish to use it.  Sandy and  Doug ask
          only  that there  be no  charge for  attending the  ritual.   It would
          disturb them greatly to find that such was the case.   
          .     
          The flash powder mentioned in the ritual was simply a mixture of sugar
          and saltpetre  (50/50).  Should you  chose to use this,  be careful to
          &quot;dump&quot; it  rather than pour it.   It will  not only be  more effective
          this  way, but  will prevent  the fire  from   climbing the  stream of
          powder back up to the hand of the person pouring it! 
           .

                                                                            1157


          PRIEST:  Three hundred  years  have gone  by since  that dark  time of
          history we all  remember as the &quot;Salem Witch  Trials,&quot; yet, even after
          three hundred years,  we dare not allow ourselves to  forget!  We must
          remember  what can happen wahen  hatred, fear, and  intolerance gain a
          stronghold  over love, sanity, and tolerance.  Innocent people died in
          Salem.  They died horrible deaths, tried and  sentends for the &quot;crime&quot;
          of witchcraft.    They died for the crime of practicing an alternative
          religion, and  they were not even  part of that religion.   They died,
          not for their own beliefs, but for ours!  They died in the name of our
          Gods, yet they did not know Them. 
          .      
          PRIESTESS:   They were not witches, but we ARE!  They were not pagans,
          but we ARE!  It is our task to remember, and to be sure history cannot
          repeat itself  today.   Therefore, we  now call their  names into  our
          circle, to be remembered and honored here. . 
          THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS  OF SALEM ARE PROCLAIMED,  ONE BY ONE, AND  A
          CHIME IS SOUNDED AFTER EACH NAME.

          .      
          PRIESTESS:   Sisters and Brothers!   We will not allow  your deaths to
          have been in vain.  
          .      
          SONG: &quot;BURNING TIMES&quot;.  ALL JOIN IN WITH THE CHORUS OF &quot;ISIS, ASTARTE&quot;
          AND THE CHANT BLENDS INTO &quot;WE ARE THE OLD PEOPLE&quot;. 
          . 
          WHEN THE SONG HAS REACHED THE PEAK OF ENERGY, THE PRIEST SAYS: .     
          We ARE the old people.  We ARE the  new people.  We ARE getting stron-
          ger  every day.  We are  stronger, and we are no  longer in hiding. We
          are here, and none  need fear us, for our way is love and our ethic is
          harmlessness, but  we say to  the world  that all may  hear:  We  WILL
          stand against hatred!  We WILL stand against intolerance!  We will not
          stand silent  in the face of  harm to others or  to our own.   The few
          have become  many, and our Gods are awake and  strong!  Never more the
          burning!  We won't be burned again! 
          .      

                                                                            1158


          PRIESTESS  (LIGHTS FIRE IN CAULDRON):   Let the cauldron burn with our
          love and our faith!  Let it illuminate the world with the light of the
          Old Religion.  Let negativity and  fear be banished in its flames, and
          let  it  kindle love  in the  hearts of  those  who hate  us. (LOUDLY,
          POINTING AT  CAULDRON) Fire!  Burn  high on all planes,  that strength
          and protection come  to us from all directions, as  we join hearts and
          hands to weave a destiny of peace and freedom! (TO CIRCLE) Let us sing
          and dance,  that all  may remember  Salem,  and the  Craft shall  ever
          survive. 
          . 
          SONG: &quot;WE  ARE THE WEAVERS&quot;.   ALL  JOIN HANDS AND  DANCE SLOWLY IN  A
          CIRCLE.   ALL WHO ARE UNABLE TO DANCE SHOULD STEP INTO THE CIRCLE, NOT
          OUT OF IT. 
          .      
          THE SONG  SHOULD BE SUNG  FOR SEVERAL ROUNDS,  ENDING WITH A  VERY EN-
          THUSIASTIC &quot;WE ARE THE WITCHES, BACK FROM THE DEAD! 
          .     
          STARTING  WITH THE EAST, THE  REPRESENTATIVE OF EACH  QUARTER WALKS TO
          THE CENTER, POURING FLASH POWDER FROM A BOWL INTO THE  
          CAULDRON, PROCLAIMING: 
          .     
          EAST: From the guardians of the mysteries of the ancient temples, from
          the windswept mountains  of Greece  and Rome, I  bring protection  and
          wisdom!  Remember Salem and the Craft  
          will survive! 
          .      
          SOUTH: From the guardians  of the mysteries of the  towering pyramids,
          from the burning deserts of the Two Lands of Egypt, I bring protection
          and courage!  Remember Salem, and the Craft will survive. 
           .     
          WEST: From the guardians of the mysteries of the Standing Stones, from
          the lakes and groves of the land of the Celts, I bring 
          protection and love!  Remember Salem, and the Craft will survive. 
            .    
          NORTH:  From the guardians of the mysteries of the  sacred runes, from
          the snow and ice of the Viking Lands, I bring protection and strength!
          Remember Salem and the Craft will survive! 
          . 
          PRIEST: Great Lady!  Bright Lord!  Lords and Ladies all! Guardians and
          Honored  Dead!  Spirits  of this place!   All in  flesh and spirit who
          have joined us  here!  We thank  you for attending!   Go if you  must,
          stay if you will!  REMEMBER SALEM! MAY THE CRAFT SURVIVE! 
           .     
          Circle is ended.
