                                  CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE 
                           copyright 1984 W. J. Bethancourt III 
                             recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE 
                                       WTP-0002 
                           tune: Same Old Man/Leatherwing Bat 
                 
                    Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand 
                    once I talked to a great Grey Man 
                    spun three times and said with a sigh 
                    "Hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!" 
                 
                 Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day 
                        hi diddle i diddle i diddle ay 
                        hi di diddle i diddle i day 
                        fol the dink a dum diddle do di day 
                 
                    Hi said the Lady, dressed in green 
                    prettiest thing I've ever seen 
                    she went down underneath the hill 
                    and came back out of her own free will 
                 
                    Brian Boru, on Irish ground 
                    walked three times the Island round 
                    Norsemen came lookin for a fight 
                    just another Irish Saturday night! 
                 
                    Hi said Lugh on the banquest night 
                    a poet and a player and a good wheelwright 
                    a harper and a warrior and none the least: 
                    a Druid and he got in to the Feast! 
                 
                    Harold Haardrada's face was red! 
                    Came to Britain and he wound up dead 
                    Stamford Bridge is where he's found 
                    got six feet of English ground 
                 
                    The Legion with it's Eagles bright 
                    marched into the Pictish night 
                    met them there upon the sand 
                    gave em up to the Wicker Man! 
                 
                    Eight-legged steed and hound of Hel 
                    the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well 
                    fire burn and fire spark 
                    are you then feared of the dark? 
                 
                    The Circle forms, the Circle flows 
                    the Circle goes where no man knows 
                    Hail to the Lady, one in three: 
                    Present is Past and Past is Me! 
                 
                    Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight 
                    all thru the Day all thru the Night 
                    Hail to the Lady, one in Three 
                    Present is Past and Past is Thee! 
                 

                                               1922
