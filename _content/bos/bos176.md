                    |                     The Scorpio Dragon                      | 
                    +-------------------------------------------------------------+ 
          
                     I am  Scorpio and  I can  fly as  high as the noble eagle or 
                     play it  down and  dirty, stinging as if a scorpion, both of 
                     which symbolize  my zodiacal sign.  I have been told so many 
                     times that I am passionate, intense, can be green with envy, 
                     can be  vindictive that  I almost  begin to  believe some of 
                     these appellations.   If  I took  seriously what is said and 
                     written, I  would be  making love  all  night  and  planning 
                     insurgencies all day. 
          
                     I am drawn to the Occult, I am competitive, I desire victory 
                     but I also insist on fair play.  It is not easy to defeat me 
                     because, like  the  fabled  Phoenix,  I  rise  from  my  own 
                     ashes...I come alive when most people would consider me dead 
                     and buried.   I  adore secrets,  I am  sensual,  my  psychic 
                     impressions usually  are accurate,  my dreams  are prophetic 
                     and I am an incurable romantic. 
          
                     I delve  deep, I  reject superficial  responses,  I  am  the 
                     probing  editor,  psychoanalyst,  finder  of  lost  persons, 
                     purveyor of  arcane aspects  of the law, knowledgeable about 
                     taxes and various aspects of inheritance. 
          
                     I can  be jealous,  will fight  for what is right, seldom do 
                     anything halfway,  can fall  madly in love and I can also be 
                     completely vulnerable.   Yes,  I can  be hurt,  but  I  also 
                     possess retaliatory  weapons that  might  give  as  adversary 
                     fits. I  tear down for the ultimate purpose of rebuilding on 
                     a more  suitable base.   I  am creative,  rebellious, can be 
                     fixed in  my views, am willing to take a gamble but prefer a 
                     sure thing. 
          
                     I am  tormented by the fact that evil exists.  Maybe that is 
                     why I  seem to  be a  natural healer.  I abhor suffering and 
                     will risk  my own  skin to  save others.  Oh, yess, I can be 
                     evangelistic.   I am dynamic and dedicated when the cause is 
                     right. 
          
                     In the  Chinese Astrology,  I am  an unquenchable  fire, the 
                     center of  all energy,  the stout  heroic heart.  I am truth 
                     and light,  I hold  power and glory in my sway.  My presence 
                     disperses dark  clouds.   I have  been chosen  to  tame  the 
                     Fates.  I AM THE DRAGON! 
          
                     Now, listen.    If  I  tell  you  anymore,  you  might  know 
                     everything and then lose interest.  And that would devastate 
                     me! 
          
                            Blessed Be!.........Sewna, The Scorpio Dragon
