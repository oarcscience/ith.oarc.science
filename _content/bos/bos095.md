                                     THE MYCENEAEN MYSTERIES 
                              A Neo-Pagan Alternative Belief System
                                  (C) 1989 By Joseph W. Teller

                            MYCENEAEN MYSTERIES : A QUICK INTRODUCTION              
                
                      Myceneaen Mysteries are an ongoing project to introduce a new
                   path of passage and religious belief to the present Neo-Pagan
                   community.

                      Like anything within the Neo-Pagan Community, we do not exist
                   in a vacuum. I have been trained in several traditions and paths
                   of the present community, and have learned much from them, but
                   have found that a personal lack of hereditary connection to some
                   of the pantheons and belief systems involved have often made my
                   practice of Celtic or Shamanistic systems to become clumsy and
                        sometimes ineffective forme personally. Thus, to find my own
              way, I went forth on a combination research project and  personal path
              searching for what path would be best for myself.

                      The Myceneaen Mysteries are based upon a personal interface
                   between myself and the aspects of the Early religious system and
                   belief of the area now known as Greece, a personal comfortable
                   status with many of the gods and goddesses of the pantheon 
              therein which I could not find in the Celtic, Norse or American 
              Indian belief systems. Many hours of painstaking research into   t h e
              true culture, beliefs, gods and means of worship practiced by    t h e
              early Myceneaens have resulted in this ongoing system of    belief. It
              is not for all, but if you feel a true connection      b e t w e e n
              yourself, the mythologies, the social structure and the     beliefs
              involved then perhaps this path is for you.

                              TheMyceneaen beliefsystemis nota total"re-creationist"
              idea, nor the structuring of a system out of whole cloth, but    like
              any belief system stemming from another time and blossoming      into
              a Neo-Pagan tradition it comes from a combination of both.  The   land
              of Myceneae has gone through not one but two dark ages      in     its
              time, and much of the original material was lost or    destroyed    or
              very badly distorted by the people that would pass     through  it  as
              their conquerors, and so I have had to take some  liberty    to    the
              myths, sorting them according to the values and   theology        they
              present as to whether they were of these people and    if so trying to
              prune out the changes made by centuries of   conquest.   This  is   an
              ongoing project, and the belief structure    will be added  to as  new
              material is encountered and adapted, but     the    basic    structure
              outlined in the pages of work already   completed  will  for the  most
              part remain stable, with each person    who takes up the system adding
              their own touch to the system.

                   Thus, if you choose this path, you will be forming and helping
                   to form the belief system for yourself and for others, making
                        your actions and writingsjust as important as thosethat have
              now been finished.  Few religions or belief paths truly allow the many
              members within it to shape the system to their own needs and     t   o
              bring about change. Myceneaen Mysteries does.

               If you are reading this file online a BBS or from a printout of
                        such,or on a distributed disk, there should be several other
              text files here for you to read over, so please do so and feel   free
              to distribute it at will among your fellow Neo-Pagans and   all   open
              minded non-pagan friends. Only through the greatest    number       of
              people getting involved can we do the greatest amount  of  improvement
              and gain personal enlightenment on this path.

                             MYCENEAEN MYSTERIES : THEOLOGICAL ANSWERS              
                
                   The purpose of this document is to explain some of the positions
                   of The Myceneaen Belief system that are considered important and
                   controversial to other Religious groups, many times to the point
                   where they will place their views not only in public view but to
                        enforce them upon others not of their beliefs 'for their own
              good'.   These positions  are important,  as they  help show  where we
              stand and also explain a bit more of what we are really about.   These
              views are not forced on the membership of the Laos, but are      t h e
              official accepted policies, beliefs and viewpoints of the 
              organization in today's world - based on the overall religion.

                   1. Contraceptive Devices.
                         We realize the importance of life, as most nature-oriented
                      religions do, and have a high respect for it and for the right
                      of all to live. On the other hand we strongly believe in the
                      right to choose one's path and actions in life. Thus, because
                      of these factors, and in consideration of the high risk of
                      disease in today's social circles, we support the use of all
                      non-destructive Contraceptive means to prevent the spread of
                      disease and the possibility of unwanted children being         
                                                                                    
                          conceived Wedo notsupport, on theother hand, operative    
                        contraceptionthrough vasectomyor sterilization- sincethese  
                        cause an actual mutilationof the bodyand because theyare    
                      both questionablein recent studies ascauses of increased      
                    cancerrates. We have astrong belief in taking responsibility    
                    forour actions, and to utilize contraceptivedevices is to       
                take responsibility in ones sexual activities.
                
                   2. Homosexuality/Bi-Sexuality.
                         These concepts in Sexuality are not nor ever have been in
                      our beliefs or those of the original Myceneaens anything but
                      Natural. To call such actions and feelings perverse, or worse,
                      is to deny the realities of nature and of the human condition.
                              We areborn bi-sexual and makeour choices based on     
              environmental  enforcement.  We accept  Homosexuality  and            
              Bi-sexuality  as true  parts of  life, not  something to  be          
              encouraged nor discouraged, but accepted as normal.
                
                   3. Public Nudity.
                         This one is obvious and simple, throughout most of the
                              Neo-Pagan community it hasalways been :if you feel    
              comfortable and won't be making too many others  uncomfortable        
              then feel welcome to any level  of dress or undress that suits        
              you. It is  suggested that among a Damos that  a full level of        
              acceptance and knowing each  others bodies, at least by sight,        
              be eventually accomplished to improve the ability of  the Damos       
              to  work as a true group bound in the love and  trust they have       
              declared (if  you can't trust to be nude in someone's presence        
              you  probably  can't trust  them  entirely). This  will  be           
              difficult for some, it  is suggested that  if a member  seems         
              uncomfortable with this that they be  introduced to it slowly         
              by the rest of the group  so they become more comfortable. Not        
              only  does this build trust, but  it can also help  in keeping        
              tension levels down and to improve health of the  group overall       
              in some ways.
                













                             Last amended June 11, 1989  --  Page NEXTRECORD 


                                                                                 367


                   4. Smoking.
                      The smoking of tobacco in today's society is deeply enmeshed,
                      but slowly people are bring the realization of the damage of
                      utilizing this herb as an addictive substance regularly. We
                      also understand the difficulties of eliminating the effects
                      of it upon the body in withdrawal. Considering all this, there
                      shall be no usage of such materials within ritual or within
                      a celebration's public confines (the exception is the use of
                      pure, natural, un-chemically treated indian tobacco for use in
                      American Indian smoking rituals - which are rare and very
                      limited in scope or exposure). If a smoker chooses to do so at
                      a celebration they must go off away from the Damos and Guests
                      to a secluded area where their second-hand smoke cannot affect
                      anyone else in the group. The Damos should join in on trying
                      to help the smoker get past the addiction and back to a sense
                      of personal worth where such is unneeded (all addiction is
                      caused by a sense of personal inferiority and incompleteness).

                   5. Ritual Drugs.
                      The use of these substances should only be within certain very
                      controlled circumstances, under extreme supervision by people
                      who are experienced and obviously personally balanced in the
                      matter. The use of illegal or highly controlled drugs is not
                      encouraged and anyone choosing to do so are doing so as an
                      individual, not as a representative of the Laos. Again, the
                              mainword iscaution withalldrugs ifyoudon't understand 
                     all the risks then don't use the substance.

                   6. Alcohol.
                      The Myceneaens were the inventors of Beer and several other
                      naturally fermented acholic drinks, and so we cannot
                      deny this part of the past nor the religious aspects of it.
                      Any naturally fermented alcohol is acceptable for libation in
                              Ritualand incelebration, butthe takingof distilled    
                            alcoholsshall not bewithin Ritual (itsalright for       
                  celebration though).  Unless a ritual is specifically to           
                                                                                    
                    Dionysus, the taking of enough alcohol to be  considered        
              'Drunk' in circle is to  be frowned upon and  felt offensive.         
              Becoming drunk in a celebration if so  wished is acceptable, so       
              long  as one maintains the  rules of hospitality and  does not        
              attempt to do such morally wrong things as  driving intoxicated       
              (Hosts be warned  that if a guest  is so intoxicated you  are         
              under obligation  to make sure they  either have a  ride home         
              with a non-intoxicated person or that sleeping space, at least        
              upon your floor, is  made available to them). Alcohol in small        
              amounts acts  as a natural remover of  the mental shields that        
              can block ones  ability to perceive the  powers of nature and         
              oneself, thus being useful in this way.

                   7. Abortion.
                      This is for many groups one of the most discussed area of
                      personal choice. In Myceneae belief, ones spirit is not found
                      within an embryo until the finish of the third month, and so
                      we support the right of a woman to choose whether or not to
                      take such an action, but do want her to consider all of the
                      available options before doing such. Life is precious, both
                              thatof amother andthat ofa child,but anexisting life  

                             Last amended June 11, 1989  --  Page NEXTRECORD 


                                                                                 368

                    will hold priority overa yet-to-be born, since ifan abortion    
                  doesoccur the spirit of the child will find another bodyto        
                gain re-entranceinto the life-cycle. We do support the use of       
                all natural abortifacient herbs and drugs over physical             
              operations, but again this is the choice of the mother and not        
              for the religion to enforce.

                 8. Pornography.
                    We believe that the true pornography in the world is depictions
                    of humanities cruelties unto itself for the purpose to glorify
                    it and encourage it. This means we label books and movies of
                    a purely violent nature to be Pornographic (Examples of such
                    are 'Faces of Death', 'The Green Berets' or any of the numerous
                    'slasher' films). Additionally we feel that films of a sexual
                    nature that show women as inferior, mere sex objects or actually
                    depict violent rape as something its not to be pornographic
                    (ex: The Story of O). We have no objections to sexuality in
                    books in films, displays of nudity or love within such. We
                    also oppose Child-pornography, bestiality and slavery of any
                    kind.

                 9. Sexual Responsibility.
                    Myceneaen beliefs have nothing in opposition to group sex or
                    group marriages, from Menage-a-trois to full multi-faceted
                    tribal families. We do have a strong ruling of community to
                    regulate ourselves, and to reduce the risks of disease and other
                    related problems. Any member of a Damos who has a sexually
                    transmutable disease should warn all other members of the Damos.
                    When a person enters into a Damos they must expose such info
                    to the members, to protect all. If a member of a Damos is in
                          a relationship withsomeone outside theDamos they should   
              refrain  from sexual  contact with  members inside  the Damos,        
              unless  sure  that  they  are  clear  of  such  afflictions.          
              Relationships within the  Damos should be  encouraged, as  this       
              will  prevent an influx of diseases from outside unknown sources.     
              Members of  a Damos who  are sexually active  in any way should       
              seek out a  medical check for such problems routinely and  should     
              share the results  with the members. Keeping everyone within the      
              Damos healthy is of import to all members of the Damos. Remember      
              a Damos is  more than just a group  of friends and acquaintances      
              as is common in  most Neo-Pagan groups, it is an extended family      
              and community.
                
                                       HISTORICAL CONTEXT
                                       -----------------
                   The Mycenaean Era is not the Greece of Homer, and has many of
                its own unique differences that set it off from that Era. It is
                sometimes known as the Golden Age or Heroic Age of the ancient
                land we call Greece. Fledgling borne from migrants coming into
                the area from Syria and Persia during the Empire of Crete, the
                Mycenaeans were a willful folk, who accepted the rule of Crete
                until the Minoans fell from power by a complex series of events
                that caused them to abandon the Mainland and Isles of Greece
                and vanish back into the mists of History. Neither The Minoans
                nor the Mycenaeans were remembered, until our own 1840's (AD)
                when the ruins were discovered and slowly excavated (a process
                still uncompleted to this day).

                                                                                 369

                   Egypt, it has been said, introduced government to the world
                (and Bureaucracy and all that goes with it). Minos introduced the
                concept of Laws governing all equally (which Homer's Greece would
                rediscover in its own era) and the value of colonization & trade.
                Each had its religions and cults, but it was in Mycenaean that did
                rise truly human gods and goddesses - those who could weep or
                laugh, who did not simply hold themselves aloof from the majority
                of the population but who were close and intricately associated
                with their people.

                   In concept, and in Mycenaean Myth, we are all descended from
                the gods. We are all their children, and we are all working
                towards learning what we must to take our proper places beside
                them one day in a future existence. We all have within us the
                ability to perform feats of wonder, magic as we call it, through our
                own ability of will and perception.

                   As children of the gods and goddesses, we are imperfect only
                in that we have not yet learned the ways to best utilize our own
                abilities and to work with nature thoroughly - as Neo-Pagans we
                can work towards this goal, unlike those who refuse to open their
                eyes to their own ability and instead falsely believe that nature
                is a force to be battled and conquered instead of one that we are
                part of and must work with in order to survive. We are not in
                any way perfect, we do not have 'the one true path' or the 'one
                way to enlightenment', we have simply chosen a path in this belief
                system and religion that serves our personal growth (some may even
                walk this path and then later chose another closer to their own
                hearts in some way). We ask that others accept the fact that we
                have chosen this path of our own free will, if they ask for any
                information we shall give it freely, and that we ask that they be
                tolerant of us in our every day lives and not show bigotry against
                us for our belief path.

                   The Mycenaean Era, historically lasted from approx. 1700 BC, as
                the Minoan Empire collapsed inward, and prospered through till 1120
                BC when the last shreds of it fell beneath the onslaught of the
                invading Dorians, who were the ancestors of Homer's Greece. The
                fall of Mycenaea brought with it a terrible 400 years of what has
                been called the 'Greek Dark Age' for the invaders destroyed all
                the knowledge of writing, and much of the culture and technology
                of the people of the land that was then Greece. They had come down
                out of the Northern parts of Central Europe, outnumbering the
                Mycenaeans and being experts at large scale war, still it took
                them from 1190 BCE to 1120 BCE to fully conquer the Mycenaeans.

                   When the Dorians invaded and conquered the people, they
                destroyed what was then the most advanced civilized people in
                Europe. Mycenae had the benefits of the technology of the Minoans
                and the advantages of a widespread sea-trade with Syria, Italy,
                Sicily, Spain, Egypt, Rhodes, Persia and even possibly the Isles
                of Britain. This widespread trade made them one of the richest
                people, and their willingness to exchange knowledge and goods
                made them welcome in many ports. Mycenae had colonized villages
                in many lands, to serve as trading posts with native peoples.
                Their only major war was, that which we know now as the Trojan
                War, in 1200 BC (approx), was a successful enterprise supposedly
                based on principle instead of greed.

                                                                                 370

                   Mycenae, like the native peoples of the Americas, were slowly
                worn down and defeated by an enemy they had sought to not war
                with but to trade with. The Dorians came first as raiders, then
                in larger numbers as they fled south from either hostile weather
                conditions or an unknown northern invader, and were not to be
                appeased with simply the lands of the neighbors of the Mycenaeans,
                such as the Hittites, but wanted the rich trade of the Black and
                Mediterranean Seas. They did not have a written language, but
                were evidently of similar stock of that which the Mycenaeans had
                once come from centuries before and spoke a similar tongue. They
                destroyed the citadels, palaces and shrines, burning many to the
                ground in their fury. They slew the learned and enslaved the
                poor and agricultural people to serve their own economy - they were
                not the peaceful folk that Homer first tries to show them to
                be, in Homer's day, after the ages, Mycenae was forgotten and
                Minoan Empire a wispy memory of long ago.

                   Parts of the culture and its gods and goddesses were still so
                strongly enmeshed in the people that remained that the Dorians
                adapted it into their own rather than try to fight its existence,
                changing it to fit their own values and warlike natures. Thus the
                Mycenaean Age faded away in history and memory until the 1840's AD
                when the ruins of Mycenae were discovered and the Archaeological
                Society of Greece began to recover its forgotten past.

                   Much of what we have to work with in our beliefs are based on
                the records of archaeological findings, the eventual deciphering
                of the few tablets and inscriptions in the ancient language of
                the people (Many of which were simply old accounting records)
                and the myths that have survived even the purging and nature of
                the Homeric era. Vocal records always change tales with the
                telling, and thus it has been painstakingly difficult to produce
                what these pages attempt to do. Much has had to been assumed in
                my research as the information is not available, and some has been
                modified to suit our modern times and needs. Thus this is not a
                recreation,no more than Ar nDracht Fan can claim an absolute
                reconstruction of Celtic Druidism, but a new view for the present
                and hopefully the future.

                      Each Wanax is responsible for seeing that their Damos sits
                   down and somehow develops a name for their Damos, and it is by
                        this name that they will be known to other Damosi. It is    
              suggested that Greek names or ones related to the places they 
              choose to name sacred or to the local Native American Indian     names
              be used (We, as members of the Myceneaen belief must   realize     the
              rights of the natives of the lands we presently live   in   and   also
              respect and honor their gods, goddesses and local      nature  spirits
              and beliefs, for like the original Myceneaens we  accept  the validity
              of local deities as much as our own, some    being  our  own known  by
              other names and some being local powers      like the  dozens of river
              gods and nature spirits found in ancient     Greece). If a name is not
              to be in Greek or in line with a Native      American  group  then  it
              should in some way reflect the nature of     the  people involved  and
              their own goals together. Names,   preferably, should not be more than
              ten words in length and not   less than  two. At the end  of each name
              shall be added the word  Damos, to identify it as a part of the Laos.



                             Last amended June 11, 1989  --  Page NEXTRECORD 


                                                                                 371


                      For the present I have chosen to act as the Basileus of the
                   'organization', that is I wish to be a personage who will be the
                   arbitrator (if requested by all sides) in disputes between any
                   two or more Wanaxi or Damosi dealing with the material in my
                   structure or in a gathering of Damosi. I will also, for the
                   moment, hold the position of a communications point between any
                   of the further spread Damosi. I hold this position only until
                   we have someone who can serve better for either position and who
                   is willing to take on the duties - the position holds no true
                   power over other Wanaxi or the greater Damosi unless they choose
                   to have me arbitrate. This position I will hold no longer than
                   ten years, and preferably much less. Once a hundred Wanax are
                   established they will have the power, by a majority decision,
                   to decide when to replace the Basileus and with who (the who
                   must be willing to take the office).

                      I also ask that all Wanaxi record their record of activities
                   (which we will call, for lack of better terminology your Damosi's
                   Book of Records) in photocopy, ASCII text file or to be
                   Handwritten/typed/carboned and pass this duplicate on to me to
                   keep  and utilize for communicating with all the members of the
                   Laos (the people, in greek) of the Mycenaea faith, either within
                   newsletters, computer files or whatever - based on the needs of
                   each individual of the faith. This is a matter of choice of the
                   Wanax personally, if they feel they need secrecy for some reason
                   that is their choice and they may choose not to send such to me.
                   I am not in a position of power in this path, simply a guide for
                   part of the way and then it is up to your own selves to decide
                   where you will go dealing with the path, your Wanax, your damos
                   and your life-cycles.

                   Many of the ancient titles and positions within Mycenae are
                no longer of great import in today's society, but might one day
                become of import. The E-qe-tai (ee-kay-tie) were the liaison
                between the temples and the military, I suggest that this be a
                position given by each Wanax to a member of their Damos when
                they feel the need for someone to act as a Liaison between the
                Damos and any other Damos, a messenger of sorts between groups,
                and also to serve as such if the group comes into contact with
                the press or other public media. This position need not be a
                permanent one, and several may be bestowed this title at one
                time if more than one series of liaisons are necessary. The
                Ko-Re-te (kowe-ray-tay) were military commanders within a Damos,
                we have no need of such at present, unless the Wanax of a group
                chooses that members of their Damos should learn a martial art
                or weapon skill for personal growth - then the Ko-Re-te will be
                the title given to a teacher within the group (You should not
                expect members of your Damos to be taught in such things by a
                person outside the Laos, nor can teaching be forced or required,
                only requested or suggested).

                  The Lawagetas was in ancient times the 'Leader of the Host',
                a military leader for a collection of the Laos from more than
                one Damos for a particular purpose. Obviously this is not a
                needed position within our present structure. The Pa-si-re-u
                was the official responsible within a Damos responsible for the
                bronze smiths, again a title I cannot see the need to restore

                             Last amended June 11, 1989  --  Page NEXTRECORD 


                                                                                 372

                (If anyone is skilled at this art and wishes to offer it as a
                teaching to members of your Damos, then grant them the title).

                  The klawiphoroi were the key-bearers, always female, of the
                temple. Since our temples, shrines, groves and altars will be
                most likely within other buildings or outside and there is no
                plan to purchase buildings at present for this purpose (for we
                are a poor folk) this title will remain among the unused.

                  Each individual of the Laos, including those not of a Damos,
                may consider themselves Mycenaean Priests and Priestesses as long
                as they choose to follow this path of Neo-Paganism. There are no
                paian (non-clerical followers), though there may be members of
                other faiths present at a ritual, celebration or gathering -
                so long as they are willing to accept the rules of hospitality.
                Due to legalities, children are brought into ritual rarely -
                they are not yet on this path and should not be forced upon it
                like some religions do. We must not make the mistakes that many
                mainstream religions have before. They can be present at an open
                celebration, but should not be brought into ritual until they
                are old enough to understand the beliefs and concepts, say
                not before their 16th birthday (this will be an arbitrary
                choice between the Wanax and the parents).

                   Finances are the choice of the to deal with, and whether they
                will handle the finances of the Damos or have a separate person
                appointed treasurer or choose to keep no finances for the group
                but run the group as a 'donate anything but money' operation. I
                would like to hear from the Wanaxi on how they are handling their
                finances and the operations herein, especially any who set up
                their Damos as a physical communal household or farm site.

                           THE LAWS OF HOSPITALITY FOR MYCENEAENS
                           ---------------------------------------
                1) A Guest always has the right to leave a Host's home, lands,
                   celebration or gathering when they wish (this is not possible
                   always in the middle of a ritual and can only be done when the
                   officiary of the ritual grants it magically etc), without
                   harm or threat of harm, with all that they brought with them
                   into the locale.

                2) A Host always has the right to ask a Guest to leave their home,
                   lands, celebration, gathering or ritual without conflict of
                   a physical or verbal nature, and to take with them all they
                   brought with them into the locale.

                3) A Host has the right to request an armed guest to peace-bond,
                   remove from the locale or to take a weapon of any obvious
                   nature, unless necessary for a ritual taking place, until it
                   the guest is ready to leave without argument or conflict.

                4) A Host has the right to request a guest not utilize or even
                   bring into their home, lands, celebration, gathering or ritual
                   any substance or device that may be legally questionable or
                   outlawed or physically harmful to the Hosts health or that of
                   other guests or members of the Damos. (this may be anything
                   from drugs, alcohol, poisons, cigarettes, flamethrowers etc.
                   all by the Host's discretion).

                5) A Host may ask the following of a personal rule of hygiene or
                   social concept be followed by a guest while within the home,
                   celebration, ritual, lands etc (EX: the removal of shoes before
                   entering the house, the washing of hands, maintaining a low
                   level of noise due to someone else sleeping, sharing in the
                   breaking of bread, etc by the host's discretion).

                6) Both Host and Guest are bound by a rule of trust - none shall
                   carry out violence of a physical or psychic nature against
                   those present or they shall be in violation of the rules of
                   Hospitality and nullify all such rules at that point.

                7) Neither Host nor guest shall steal from the other - either
                   doing such shall be in violation of the rules of Hospitality
                   and they shall be annulled at that point.

                                                                                 374


                8) The Host may ask one service of the guest if they are to
                   share meal, sleep within the hosts area, or in other words
                   impose on the host in any manner. This service cannot require
                   the leaving of the hosts area, nor be of an illegal, personally
                   distasteful or harmful way, but will most probably be of a
                   simple manner (and not the tasks set out historically in legend)
                   such as assisting with the setting of the table, chopping of
                   wood for the fire, etc. This is not mandatory, simply suggested
                   in conceptual context of the original Mycenaean Society.

                9) The Host and guest, if of different religions, will not seek to
                   force their beliefs upon the other - discussion is allowed, but
                   not obvious attempts to convert or proselytize.

                10) The Host and guest (and members of the Hosts Damos) will not
                   seek to force their affections on each other sexually - this
                   does not rule out flirtation, involvement or seduction, but
                   does rule out harassment, forced sex and rape. If a person
                   says they are not interested then their word is final and any
                   further consideration should be personally curbed. Violation of
                   this rule invalidates the rules of hospitality in the
                   situation.

                11) The Host may request of a Guest reimbursement for any supplies
                   that have been used in the feeding or entertainment of the guest
                   that are considered excessive. Additionally a guest is expected
                   to repay any bills of an excessive nature (such as those of
                   long distance telephone calls) that they are responsible for.

                12) A Guest at Ritual is expected to accept the Authority of the
                   officiaries within the ritual area as absolute, and shall not
                   question their authority or actions while within the ritual area.
                   Nor shall a Guest seek to disrupt a ritual from within or from
                   outside of it while it is being carried out.

                13) A Guest is expected to provide a gift for a host or the hosts
                   Damos when visiting for ritual (A food dish or libation is the
                   common practice) or celebration. This is waved if not more than
                   one days notice has been given or if the Guest claims a truly
                   impoverish condition in their own life.

                  The above may seem simplistic, obvious or unnecessary, but I feel
                it is important that we have a set of rules for those who cannot
                see the obvious and to protect all involved. Further, I'd like to
                request that any member of the Laos who has had the Rules violated
                by a Host or Guest (especially those rules dealing with violence,
                Forced affection, theft etc) to report them by name to me, anyone
                who has been found in such violation with witnesses by members of
                any three Damosi will be reported as such and publicized by us
                internally to be avoided as Guest or Host (and of course, if a
                legal violation occurs any Host is welcome to report them as such
                to the authorities).

                   Remember that a Guest or host cannot be considered held by the
                rules of Hospitality if they have not seen them and agreed to them
                beforehand. Feel free to suggest that other Neo-pagan groups
                accept these rules themselves - this does not have to be just a
                Myceneaen only concept.
                                  ETHICS & CONCEPTS OF CONDUCT
                                  ----------------------------
                   You take, by using this work and collection of beliefs and the
                title of Myceneaen Priest or Priestess, the responsibility for
                your own life and actions in it. Every time you make a decision
                in life you are exercising your freedom and are responsible for
                your actions. With knowledge and power come great responsibility,
                to yourself, your Damos, your Waxan, the Laos, your homeland,
                your birth family, the human race and that of the entire planet.
                There are no 'evil' forces manipulating you or your actions, no
                devils or demons exist save in the minds of others (and if any do
                exist in your own mind then you must cast them out). No amount of
                alcohol, drugs or influence shall change the fact that you are
                still responsible for what you choose to do and not to do.

                   Yes, we recognize that there are forces beyond our ability to
                fully conceive in this reality, that at times the gods and the
                goddesses might interfere with our lives, remember that there is
                something to be learned from each success and every failure, that
                they do not wish you to suffer - they simply wish you to learn
                and advance to one day rise above the need for the state of being
                what you are at present - bound within a limiting fleshly body
                for this cycle and for each you have and will have given to you
                until you have learned all this existence can teach and advance
                to a level where you may enjoin with the gods and see beyond our
                present.
