                           CELTIC WORKSHOP (Internet)
    This is an Upload of the first Celtic Workshop on Druids, Oghams and 
    Divination. Each student was supposed to have already downloaded the
    Library 16 files Oghamd.txt (A table of Ogham correspondences),
    Fionnw.GIF ( A symbollic representation of Oghams in Circles.) and
    Ogham.GIF (A picture showing exactly how each tree Ogham symbol looked.)
    In additional to these files, messages were posted in the Section 15
    message board for Ogham correspondence tables by Nigel Pennick, D.J.
    Conway, John Matthews, Murray Hope, Douglas Monroe and Edric Thorsson.
    A lot of information is contained in these files and messages and
    is essential for fully understanding the workshop and discussion. I 
    recommend reading "The Celts" by Nora Chadwick for historical background
    on the Celts as a people. I recommend John Matthews book "Celtic
    Shamanism" and also Nigel Pennick's book "Magical Alphabets". More
    complete discussions of many of these topics are found in those works.

    Due to time constraints, All the prepared material did not get
    presented during the Workshop. I have included it here in it's entireity
    at the request of the participants and in the interest of completeness.

    Before starting the Workshop, we engaged in informal conversation  with
    the first topic being the book "Life of a Druid Prince". Jehana asked 
    if I had read this book.

    <Start of Workshop>

    O'Dubh  : Never read the book
    Jehana  : It's basically an archeological/anthropological study of...
              one of those sacrificed humans they pulled out of a peat bog.
    SUZAN   : hello Jehana!
    Jehana  : with some interesting speculations as well.
              Hello suzan.
              Hail!
    O'Dubh  : I saw an article on it with pictures in Scientific American I 
              think.
              Merry Meet Again Maiden!
    Jehana  : yes, i think they covered it there, too.
    O'Dubh  : looks like UFOs are the talk of the town tonight.
    Jehana  : And The Crone greets the Maiden!
    SUZAN   : there was a great TLC special on an archeological find like 
              that
    Jehana  : suzan is still here.
              suzan?
    SUZAN   : geesh! there are 27 people in that room!
    O'Dubh  : yes it's a mad house over there
    SUZAN   : oh just lurking around a bit sorry :)
    O'Dubh  : I didn't get any advertising here.
    Jehana  : too busy to stay there. <g>
    O'Dubh  : had to do it all myself.
    Jehana  : rilla mentioned it to me when i logged in tonight.
    O'Dubh  : everytime I log on here I'm bombarded with announcements
              but no Celtic Workshop!:(
              Hi Susan W!!
    Jehana  : hey, celtic workshop!!
    Susan W.: Hi, just nosey, what's going on?
    Jehana  : hello susan...
              odubh is about to do a celtic ../.
              druidic workshop.
    3130

    O'Dubh  : We're gonna be talking about Celts, Druids and the like
    Jehana  : is it workshop or discussion or both?
    Susan W.: Maybe I'll listen in for awhile, already been on over anhour.
    O'Dubh  : I know how expen$ive it is!<G>
    Jehana  : same here.
    O'Dubh  : Well I guess I'm gonna start
    Susan W.: What can I learn here?
    O'Dubh  : You can learn Magick, Shamanism, Oghams, Divination
              But it won't happen overnight.
              Also Druid type stuff.
              There's a lot to cover.
    Jehana  : (But it doesn't all require connect time) <g>
    O'Dubh  : that's right
              A lot of the files are in the library or message boards
              any way Maybe I should start.
    Jehana  : ga
    O'Dubh  : I'm going to upload the announcement first so you can see what 
             we'll cover.
    Susan W.: great
    O'Dubh  : Dia dhuit, a Kheltoi is ni Kheltoi!
              (Hello to all Celts and Non-Celts!)
              We are going to be having on-going Work Shops regarding Celtic 
             Topics of Interest here in the NewAge Forum. I hope to draw
                   you Celts and NonCelts alike out of the Groves and into the
                   CO's!<G> Time to share some of that Knowledge we've been
                   hiding! 
              I plan to touch on the following topics of interest:

                      CLASS #1
                      Druids, Oghams, Divinations
                      CLASS #2 
                      Deities, Shamanism, Magick
                      CLASS #3 
                      History, Warriors, Geneologies (maybe your family         name!)
                      CLASS #4 
                      Languages (Gaeilge, Gaelic, Welsh, Manx,Breton), 
                      Poetry, Prose

              I will basically upload files to the library, prior to the 
              class, to provide a focal point for the discussions and a 
              framework for building a Celtic Book of Shadows. We will 
              flesh these frameworks out through discussions online. I, 
              by no means, have all the answers on matters Celtic. 
              But I truly believe that ALL of us, working together, can 
              approach advance our knowledge and rediscover the True Celtic
                   Way.

              Druids are especially welcome to attend so that our Celtic 
              Knowledge may be "Illuminated"!<G> 
              I also hope that The Welsh Bards will grace us with the Songs 
              of Taliesin. 
              
              Other topics will be included based upon the desires and 
              direction of the students and other participants.

              I see the way that the workshops will be conducted as:
    Susan W.: ?
    3131

    O'Dubh  :         Opening Remarks by Me.
                      Presentation by a Speaker (not necessarily me).
                      Questions and Answers.
                      Group Open Discussion and Discovery.
                      Summation and Assignments.

              The classes start this Monday night in Work Shop 1 of the
    NewAge 
              Forum at 10 PM EST! See you there!<G>
              Beannacht leat,
              (Blessed be)
              O'Dubh
              Susan W> ga
    Susan W.: Oh, sorry, thought my screen was stuck there.  GA
    O'Dubh  : OK That was the announcement and sorry if it was wrapping on 
              your screens!<G>
    Jehana  : sorry, i do have to go; i will put this workshop on 
              next monday's calendar.
    O'Dubh  : I'll continue with the presentation
              Ce'ad Mi'le Failte!  (100,000 Welcomes)
              Welcome to the Celtic Workshop!
              We will be investigating  and sharing our knowledge
              of matters Celtic here. 
              It is my hope that the researches and references 
              I have will add to or compliment your own. 
              I am, by no means, the final authority on 
              these matters. 
              Discussion and interaction, coupled with a
              shamanistic journey or two should fill in
              the gaps and illuminate us all.
              all
    Dean    : hello
    O'Dubh  : Tonight I hope to lay down a firm framework
              for our knowledge of Druids through a
              discussion of their Magickal writing,
              called Ogham, after Ogma - Sun Face,
              and through a discussion of their divination
              techniques.
              It is commonly thought that the Druids left
              no written records of their work.
              I disagree.
              Many references exist that contain the
              poems of Druids, stories about their Magicks,
              tales of their strategies, their secret lore,
              their Oghams, their invocations, their victories
              and their defeats.
              The major problems with using this information
              is that it is the product of a long
              (tho reliable) oral tradition that was finally
              written down by their antecedents the Culdean
              Monks of the Celtic Church.
              (Probably Druids in hiding).
              Some of the Irish manuscripts 
              used as references on Druids are:
              The Book of Armaugh
              The Book of Ballymote
                  (A primary source for Oghams)
              The Tain Bo Cuailgne
    3132

              The Book of the Dun Cow
              The Book of Invasions
              The Book of Leinster
              Many references to what Druids did
              are contained within the above books.
              Much of what Celts wrote was symbollic
              of deeper meanings.  Each work can
              be interpreted on many levels.
              In modern times, Druidry is being studied
              by several major groups, ADF and OBVD to
              name just two.
              If we have any Druids present tonight,
              Please come forth and identify yourselves now.
              (well, since only us chickens are here!<g>)
    Susan W.: .
    O'Dubh  : I'll identify myself as a student of Wicca, Druids and Celts
              Susan W>Whatis your interest or area?
    Susan W.: I have no knowledge in this area . .
              I have been told a little bit by a friend.
              The extent  . . .
              is that I understand this Wicca, Druid beliefs,
              are very old and are based on the powers of the earth?
              ga
    O'Dubh  : yes the knowledge of Druids/Wiccans is based upon the Earth
    and 
              it's power.
              The knowledge of the Oghams is tree knowledge applied as
    symbols
              in the use of Magick and Divination.
              I'll upload some info on each symbol
              or group of 5 symbols and show what their
              meanings are.
              The Druids were the shamans of the Celtic
              Clans. They carried the history, the culture 
              and the geneologies of the Clan in their memories.
              To aid in remembering this information,
              Oghams were used, each Ogham being
              associated by its beginning sounds
              with the item to be remembered. This
              is similar to alliteration in today's
              writings.This led to an entire series of
              different types of Oghams.
              Tonight we will discuss tree oghams and Fionn's Wheel.
              Ogham BTW is pronounced "O Wam".
              It's one of those strange Gaelic things!<G>
              I have listed the Oghams for
              those of you that haven't 
              downloaded the Ogham GIF's
              or the Ogham Divination files
              in Library 16 yet.
              Each Ogham is listed by its
              ancient Gaelic name, then its
              modern Irish name and then its
              Welsh counterpart.
              The first group of 5 is from the
              North on Fionn's Wheel.
              (it is from the Book of Ballymote)
              7th century Irish manuscript.

    Susan W.: How would you use this information, for example . . .
              the Native Americans use prayers for certain rituals, such as 
              blessing your surroundings.
              How would you use that infor.?
              Ga
    O'Dubh  : The information would be used 
              in divinations and in casting spells.
              It would also be used to mark pathways for Spiritual journeys
              into the Celtic Otherworld.
              The first use of Oghams was on Birch, for instance,
              and it was interpreted by the Irish God Lugh to mean
              that a Magickal attack was going to be made
              upon his wife.
    Freepowder: hi all
    O'Dubh  : He took precautions.
              Hi Freepowder !! we are underway with our workshop.
    Freepowder: I didn;t miss it?
    O'Dubh  : I'm just telling Susan how Ogham information was used.
              It's happening right now.
              Anything missed will be in the library.
    Freepowder: out standing, but I can't stay long<sigh>
    O'Dubh  : Susan>Does that answer your question?
    Freepowder: GA
    Susan W.: So, he called upon the spirit of the Birch tree to protect 
              him???
    O'Dubh  : He used the Magick of the Birch symbol to protect him and
              his wife. Birch was used to surround them and protect them
              from Magickal attack. Lugh's wife was in danger of being
              spirited away to the Underworld.
    Freepowder: (sorry) who are we talking about?
    Susan W.: Gottcha. :) Difference in interpretation. GA
    O'Dubh  : The Celts were also shamanistic just like the Native Americans
              Ok
    Susan W.: ?
    O'Dubh  : FP>We are talking about the use and meaning of Oghams and 
              symbols of Magick.
              FP>GA
    Freepowder: in general?
    O'Dubh  : Well I'm presenting the meaning for each Ogham as based upon 
              the information handed down by the Irish Druidic Bards.
    Misty   : Can you tell us a little about the shamanistic part of the 
              Celts?
    Freepowder: ah!
    O'Dubh  : Misty>I will cover that more fully next week but....
              the Celts lived close to nature as did most peoples
    O'Dubh  : in the past. They observed that they had to interact with
              it on a more personal basis than we do today.
              I am introducing symbols and diagrams to be
    O'Dubh  : used in Magickal journeying.
    Misty   : Ok, sounds good!!
    Freepowder: O'd> the Celts focused mainly on Trees & shrubs, while the 
              NAIndians,
    Freepowder: focused more on animals , right?
    O'Dubh  : FP>The Celts tied Oghams to everything...
              Birds, animals, shields, flowers you name it!<G>
    Freepowder: !
    O'Dubh  : They even had a secret Hand Language<G>!
              GA
    3136

    Misty   : I've heard of that...how was that used?
    Freepowder: <aside> sounds like modern gang!>...
              Ogham was used like runes or tarot?
              ga
    O'Dubh  : FP>one of the messages I posted has a direct correllation for
              Oghams and TArot!
    Susan W.: ?
    Freepowder: I missed it, been a heavy wkend<abashed> GA
    O'Dubh  : It's in Section 15.
              Susan >GA
    Susan W.: I had someone give me a shamanistic (N.Amer.) style
              drumming experience. ..
              in which I saw the trunk of a very large tree . .
              with a section that you could walk into  . . .
              like the old forest located S. of Yosemite . . . what are
    those 
              called again. ?  Anyway GA
              Any meaning to that vision? O'D?
              Sequoia . that's it.
              O'D> GA
    SUZAN   : O'D is having some trouble with his connection.......
              he will be right back.....
    Susan W.: ok
              I'm probably gonna split in a few . . . been on almost 2hrs.
    SUZAN   : thanks for being patient
    Susan W.: What are your interests again Suzan?
    SUZAN   : i am an astrologer
    Freepowder: Suzan> by the look of it we have just got started w/ this, 
              right?
    Susan W.: Hi O'D
    Freepowder: welcome back O'D
    O'Dubh  : Sorry about the line going down!<G>
              Thanks guys!
    Freepowder: Mercury is retarded<G>
    O'Dubh  : So where were we?
    Freepowder: Sequoyah in vision
    Susan W.: Did you get I saw trees in a vision?
    O'Dubh  : FP!>LOL probably what the prob is!<G>
    Freepowder: GA<G>
    O'Dubh  : Susan>Yes
    Susan W.: Any importance?
    O'Dubh  : I was telling how Celts/Druids
              saw all of life interconnected like the Oak limbs
              I believe your vision is telling you 
              to look within yourself to see how
              you connect to the life around you
              perhaps you should go on a shamanistic journey.
    Freepowder: ?
    O'Dubh  : Discover your inner truths.
              FP> ga
    Freepowder: Shamanistic Journey?...
              you mean like a vision quest?
    Misty   : Did we lose him again?
    O'Dubh  : Yes FP but along definate paths
    Susan W.: O'D> celtic style?
    O'Dubh  : let me continue and I'll show you the map.
    Freepowder: GA
    O'Dubh  : Susan>Definately Celtic style if that is what you feel closest
    3137

              to.
    Susan W.: Actually more N.Amer. style :)
    O'Dubh  : Native American style is nice but I am a Celt.
    Susan W.: Tell me your way.
    O'Dubh  : Watch and see !!
              they (the ways) may be closer than you know!:)
    Freepowder: <watching><G>
    O'Dubh  : Ok I'm going to skip the Ogham meanings and go straight to the

              Wheel of the journeys.
              This is Fionn's wheel and is a GIF in Lib 16.
              <now uploading path names>
              Fionn's Wheel is a diagram found in the Book of Ballymote. 
              It shows all 25 Oghams arranged around a series of concentric
              circles (in library 16 as fionnw.gif). This diagram can be 
              used to divine paths necessary for "Pathworking", a very 
              powerful shamanistic technique. I have identified the meanings
                   of each Ogham on the paths (using the correspondences from
                   Nigel Pennick mostly). Each Ogham's meaning can require at
                   least a workshop of it's own to fully cover. I offer these here to show what can be done with Oghams:
              
              An Roth de an Bealach
              (The Wheel of the Ways)
              ___________________________________
              Each path will be identified with it's Gaeilge/English name 
              and the elements along the Ways.
              
              The Northern Path is first.
              (from outside to inside)
              ___________________________________
              An Cosa'n do Sla'n 
              (The Way of Protection)
              The White Tree of Purity
              The Tree of Life
              The Red Man
              The Moon
              The Keys to the Future
              ___________________________________
              This is the first path on Fionn's wheel
    0jim     : hellod
    O'Dubh  : It contains the first 5 Oghams B L F S N
    jim     : hello
    O'Dubh  : This path is first because it teaches the new
              student how to protect him/herself from Magickal harm.
              HELLO jIM
              Please standby
    jim     : ok
    O'Dubh  : this is a formal Workshop
              But join in !!! 
              Any way, the first step was Purification,
              followed by gaining an ally in "the Red MAn",
              a being kind of like Coyote in Native American workings.
              The tree of life is there as well
              (this could be what Susan saw in her dream)
              The Moon represents the protection of the Goddess
              When the inner level is reached
              the student gains the keys of knowledge
    3138

              but not the wisdom to use them.
              Another journey must be made.
              That is the next path.
              ___________________________________

    O'Dubh  : This Path contains the Ogham EBA:

              An Roth de an Bealach
              (The Wheel of the Ways)
              ___________________________________
              An Cosa'n de Fe'ile
              (The Way of Ritual)
              The Sacred Grove (Imbolc)
              ___________________________________
              
              This path requires an understanding of
              the major Religious festivals of the
              Celtic year begining with Imbolc,
              The new beginings
              The festival of Brigit.
    Susan W.: !
    O'Dubh  : It also requires one to perform such a ritual
              Susan>ga
    Susan W.: O'D & all>  sorry, but I gotta go.  Thanks for the info.

    jim     : Thanks for the insight to PAGANISM.  Get out of this stuff!
    Freepowder: ?

    O'Dubh  : JiM>We are Druids, Pagans, Witches and stuff like that.
    jim     : !
    O'Dubh  : You are well to listen in to the workshop.
              Jim>standby just a second.
              FP has a question
              FP>ga
    Freepowder: I thought Samhain was the beginning of the Celtic year?
              ga
    O'Dubh  : FP>It's the begining of the Celtic year but not necessarily
              the begining of the study of Celtic religions.
              ga
    Freepowder: ?
    O'Dubh  : FP>ga
    Freepowder: Imbolc...
              is the start of this path of wisdom?...
              or study on fionn wheel, right?
    O'Dubh  : FP>The study of all the major festivals is the second path
              The symbol is actually the Grove.
              The most powerful Magick in the Druid rites
    Freepowder: ah!
    3139

    O'Dubh  : was The victory of life over death,
              the renewal of the wheel of the year,
              the marriage of the Crone to the Oak King or Cernnunos.
              That would not be an appropriate start point for begining
              the study of Druidic Magicks. (Before a student can begin
              Magickal work, the ability to shield and protect oneself
              must first be developed. This is why the first way studied is 
              the way of protection. The next step to performing or learning

              occult wisdom would be in a protected environment, such as rituals or Circles. What better ritual for a fresh start than
                   Imbolc which is symbollic of New Beginings and the Quickening
                   of Life?  Samhain is actually the end point of the year and
                   represents the  culmination of the Druidic Mysteries.

              Jim>I believe you had a question?ga
    jim     : not really
    O'Dubh  : ok
    jim     : just watching and laughing
    O'Dubh  : any other questions?
    Scott   : ?
    Misty   : So are you saying that Winter Solstice is the beginning of 
              the wheel?
    O'Dubh  : Jim>I suggest that you watch your behavior
              since the forum has some strict rules about 
    jim     : ?
    O'Dubh  : putting down what others believe.
              Jim>ga
    jim     : i'm not putting you down, just enjoying the show
    O'Dubh  : Jim>Are you done?
              or do you have a question?
    jim     : 1!
              ?
    O'Dubh  : Jim>ga
    jim     : soo sorry if i offended anyone, didn'y mean to
              got to go
    O'Dubh  : Goodbye jim
              now to continue
    Freepowder: Slan leat J
    Scott   : ?
    O'Dubh  : the next path to aid us in becomming more enlightened is the 
              Eastern path on the wheel.
    Misty   : What about my question?  Or did someone beat me to it?
             ********  Answer inserted by O'Dubh  ****************
             (I completely missed Missy's question in all the confusion.   
            The answer to Missy's question is that Samhain is the begining 
              and the ending of the Celtic year. It is the time when the God 
             of the Underworld marries the Crone aspect of the Goddess. The 
             new God or the Sun is not yet reborn until the Winter          Solstice.  The Celts began their days at sundown. It is not surprising that they began their new year with the end of the last harvest.  The period between Samhain and Imbolc is the dark part of the year and is therefore like the night before the day. During this period preparations were made for the onset
    of winter and the coming spring planting.)

    What follows is the rest of My presentation concerning divination:

    O"Dubh  : Western (read Druidic) meditation was usually done 
            for divination and foretelling the future. 
            This was called by the names: Tenm Laida, Dichetal
            Do Chennaib and Imbas Forosna.

            Tenm Laida (Illumination by Song) is an altered state 
            usually achieved by chanting or singing of a repetitive 
            pattern. This can also include drumming and dancing. 
            These activities synchronize the body and mind to
            an external rhythm allowing us to cast off the chains 
            of normal existence.

            This allows one to float at peace within the song 
            (dance, beat, mantra, etc.) This is a strictly Druidic 
            or Shamanistic practice even though it may look like TM.

            Dichetal Do Chennaib (Cracking  open the Nuts of Wisdom) 
            is a state achieved by relaxation and clearing the mind 
            in a Ritual environment. It usually involved using some 
            Magickal implement such as a knife, a sword or a staff 
            to touch a subject (usually upon the head) or involved 
            the handling an item so that the diviner could discover 
            what secret knowledge was contained within it. 
            This information could be events from a person's past life, 
            a detailed history of who and what had happened to an object 
            or how and why the subject was being hexed or spelled. 
            I know this sounds like ESP but it was enhanced through 
            Ritual and relaxation techniques. I believe that Dichetal
            Do Chennaib is the proper state for performing Ogham
            divinations as well. More on this later.

            Imbas Forosna (Illumination) was a form of altered state 
            used by seers and bards to create or see visions. 
            The Druid would be totally isolated from all sensory inputs, 
            sounds, lights and feelings. This was usually a very
            dark room or a covering of hides. The Druid would attempt 
            to float and relax. When in the proper state he/she would 
            signal for the hides to be removed or he/she would open 
            the door out of the Darkness. The sudden, instantaneous 
            transition from Darkness to Light would cause him/her to see 
            visions or to spontaneously utter poems, prophecies or to 
            achieve a total Awareness of the secret Knowledge of 
            their Surroundings. This sensory deprivation forced oneness upon

            them and caused them to become centered and to float. It was 
            their Ultimate Meditation technique.

            The Druids also used music, colors, trees and numbers to alter
            their consciousness. They were familiar with the Pythagorean   
            Mysteries and may have actually been the source of them!<G>

            Druids shared IndoEuropean roots with the Indian Brahmans but
                   I don't have any hard data to support any similarities in their practices.

    O'Dubh  : To perform an Ogham divination , one must be clear about the
            purpose or object of the divination before begining. Focus this 
            purpose in your mind before starting meditation and/or Circle
            casting. I find that working within a Magickal Circle tends to
            prevent outside psychic influences but don't believe it's 
            absolutely necessary to use a Circle. The form of divination
            is Dichetal Do Chennaib. 
            
            What we will be doing is casting sticks or "fews" upon a casting
            cloth. The sticks are about finger length and size and carved
            with Oghams for each of the 25 symbols. (I prefer to work with
            woods that are the actual symbols used for each Ogham where    
            possible.
            Obviously, some "Crane Bag" symbols are not trees and will have
            to be carved on some neutral wood or other substance, shells or
            rocks for instance. I use Ash or Oak for any substitutions.)
            The casting cloth is a representation of Fionn's Wheel and can
            be multicolored (as in the GIF), plain (Black and White) or just
            drawn on the floor or ground. I like to make the largest Circle
            about my height (in my case 6'2" but use what is suited to you).
            I orient the Wheel with the "B" Ogham to the North. I stand on
            the South side of the Wheel facing North about 3 feet back from
            the "M" Ogham. Place the Oghams in a bag and then randomly     
            select 7 of them. Close your eyes, spin around three times while
            blanking your mind from everything but your purpose. At the end
            of the third spin toss the 7 "fews" into the air about 3 feet
            above your head and towards the center of the Wheel. Once they
            have settled out immediately read the arrangement of the sticks
            as a general impression only. Write this down. Also record the
            relative orientations and postions of the "fews" upon the Wheel.
            Pick up the cast sticks and return them to the bag. Repeat this
            process twice more so that a total of three readings is        
            available.

    O'Dubh  :You should now have three Wheel/Ogham Divination charts that 
            have the relative positions of 21 Oghams on them. Interpret the
            Oghams based upon the correspondences I referenced previously.
            (This came from Nigel Pennick's Book "Magical Alphabets" with
            the actual meanings for the Oghams being from the Bardic/Druidic
            traditions as passed dowm by the Clan Bards of the O'Flahertys).
            I use the correspondences that "feel" right to me. You should
            do the same. No one set of correspondences is the absolutely
            right one to use. The above correspondences just hang together
            better in my own mind. The basic technique to reading the tale
            of the sticks is to read then deosil (clockwise) and from the
            outside to the inside. The "fews" towards the center represent 
            the future and those towards the outside the past. Any sticks
            not on the Wheel are ignored. Crossed sticks conflict. Parallel
            sticks compliment or enhance. Sticks laying on Oghams of the
            Wheel have combined effects. The interpretation is not hard and
            fast. I read the symbols as a "story" that is dynamic. I take
            all three divinations together. If they have no correllation at
            all, I ignore the results and try again. Sometimes A divination
            is not possible. I'll try at least three times to get results.
            The relative agreement of each of the Three Wheel/Ogham charts 
            determines the degree of confidence one can have in the
    readings, from utter certainty to total confusion! (reminds me of Sex
    for some reason but that's another story!<G> I guess the point is that
    3145

    such Powers and their use are not instantaneous or easy to realize
    at times. Sometimes its easy and other times impossible no matter 
    how much you try!<G>) This entire process of interpretation is very
    similar to: Palmistry, Tarot, Astrology or Runes. They are all basically
    taking seemingly random or (at least) uniquely individualized instances
    from a person's life and attempting to give meaning to such events based
    upon how they relate to Magickal symbols and patterns. What is actually
    occurring is that the left brain is gathering facts from the cast
    patterns that configure the mind and Spirit to allow the right brain to
    make the "Salmon leap" to intuitive insight or Illumination. This is 
    Dichetal Do Chennaib or "cracking open the nuts of Wisdom" at its
    finest.

            After the divination is finished, dismiss your Circle and fold
    or erase your casting Wheel or cloth. Store them separately and away
    from normal life until they are to be used again. I recommend a wooden
    or cedar chest. Use whatever represents peace, quiet and solitude for
    you.

    O'Dubh  : So what have we found from this discussion of Druids, Oghams
    and divination? We found that Information exists concerning Druid Oghams
    in the ancient 7th and 8th century writings of Irish monks-Druids. We
    disovered that Fionn's Wheel can be used as a divination casting cloth
    and as a "map" for "Pathworking". We suggested that the Ogham correspon-
    dences can identify unique ways to Magickal knowledge and insight.  Most
    of this information came from oral Druid histories that were finally
    written down in the first millenia by the Druid remnant or Culdean
    Monks. I admit that some of my presentation has been colored by my
    interests in other forms of MAgick that have more readily available
    information, such as Runes, Tarot and Astrology. I have also made every
    effort to go to an ancient textural source or, at the very least, to a
    modern writer basing their work upon ancient verified Druidic works. In
    our future investigations into Druidic practices and Magick, I hope to 
    continue using the same techniques to discover or rediscover the
    Mysteries of the inner Druidic Knowledge.

           Sue Thornburg        | Sounds terrific. :)
           O'Dubhain            | It runs like a formal CO to begin Just put

           Fred McCandless      | so toss out an idea
           O'Dubhain            | If you have a comment or a question
                                      | OK

           Fred McCandless      | ?
           O'Dubhain            | I placed a bunch of  files in the library
    16 to be used in the workshop.  ok Fred>GA
           Fred McCandless      | si
           O'Dubhain            | Fred> Got a question?
           Wren                 | He's gone, O'd
           O'Dubhain            | anyway the way it works is just like 
    3147

    that!<G> ok The files give you background on what we discuss.  So the
    first question I would ask is....
           Jehana Silverwing    | hi odubh.
                                      | ust 
           O'Dubhain            | Why are we studying these subjects?
                                      | Hi Jehana!
                                      | I mean what are we going to get out of this 
                                      | study?
           Nan                  | cause we like to waste $$ on CI$? <GGG>
           O'Dubhain            | ANyone want to volunteer an opinion?
           Falcon               | !
           O'Dubhain            | Falcon>ga
           Falcon               | I study things because they are there and
    I feel I should learn as much as I can
           Nan                  | !
           O'Dubhain            | Me too Falcon!<G>
                                      | Nan>ga
           Nan                  | on a more serious note....I'm interested
    in learning about them because they are part of my heritage and the
    heritage of those around me
           O'Dubhain            | That's a reason I study them too Nan. When
    I asked myself these questions I came up with some answers.  Why study
    Oghams?  The answer was because the Druids used them in Magick.
           David Pfeiffer       | To add more to that Nan, being new here,
    I'd like to learn more about the history of the natural beliefs because
    they may be the only saving grace of this planet.
           O'Dubhain            | They are symbols of Magick.  David> That's
    a good one too.
           David Pfeiffer       | Sorry to interrupt. <g>
           O'Dubhain            | The reason I study Magick is just that
    that's ok I study Magick of the Earth and of people and of the SPirit to
    find the keys to who I am How we relate to each other and to the Planet
           Jehana               | i agree with david.
           O'Dubhain            | This is a time that we are all coming
    together to save ourselves and our Planet The ancient Wisdom shows us a
    Way to do this Jehana
           O'Dubhain            | We must look within for the Power of
    self-awareness For growth and harmony.  The Oghams are the roadsigns on
    the Ways to this Wisdom
           David Pfeiffer       | But the whole idea is not for ourselves. 
    We are just as important as individuals as a leaf is to a tree.  One
    leaf only holds so the tree may live.
           O'Dubhain            | One map of this inner journey is Fionn's
    Wheel.  Right again David.  But we must start with ourselves.  To have
    a tree one must have leaves. and branches and a trunk and roots as well
    as Life.  It's all got to work together.  The purpose of this workshop
    tonight is to  determine the way that Fionn's Wheel shows us how to
    "Pathwork" to knowledge of ourselves.
           Nan                  | ?
           O'Dubhain            | To show how Druids did this Yes Nan
           Nan                  | i think i know what you mean by "pathwork"
    but could you please give a brief definition so that i know we're
    thinking the same
           O'Dubhain            | OK. Pathworking is basically an inner
    journey to discover Truths within ourselves
           Falcon               | ?
           Nan                  | thanks
           O'Dubhain            | It allows us to tap a "Higher" wisdom To
    3148

    know our totems and our Spirit guides. Yes Falcon ga.
           Falcon               | What is Finion's Wheel?
           O'Dubhain            | Fionn's Wheel is a representation of the
    Oghams laid out in Circles around a center.  Like a Native American
    Medicine Wheel.  It is pretty much the same thing for shamanistic
    purposes I uploaded a GIF of it into Lib 16 as FIONNW.GIF
           Falcon               | thanks
           O'Dubhain            | On it are the Ogham symbols for our
    journey.
           Wren                 | ?
           O'Dubhain            | Each symbol represents an ability or a
    knowledge to be gained or understood, Wren ga
           Wren                 | Is there a book with the diagram?  I can't
    see GIF's
           O'Dubhain            | It's in the following books: "The Book of
    Ogham" by Edred Thorsson, "The Celtic Shaman" by John Matthews
           Jehana               | will capture the gif.
           O'Dubhain            | "The Book of Ballymote" by a 7th century
    Culddean Druid<G>, Jehana also in Religion lib.
           Jehana               | okay, odubh.
           Beth Campbell        | send 2 what's Palyne? Is this a formal co?
           O'Dubhain            | yes Beth?  The way Druids worked Magick
    was by "becoming" or by actually changing reality A classic example of
    this is The Song of Amergin the Druid who aided the Gaels in defeating 
    the Tuatha de Danaans.  I quote from his song:
                                      | "I am the wind which breathes upon the sea.
                                      | I am the wave of the ocean.
                                      | I am the murmur of the billows.
                                      | I am the ox of the seven combats.
                                      | I am the vulture upon the rocks.
                                      | I am a beam of the Sun.
                                      | I am the fairest of plants.
                                      | I am a wild boar in valour.

           Jehana               | by the way, whose translation is this?  
           O'Dubhain            | Yes it teaches and it invokes the power of
    the Land.  This was the translation by Douglas Hyde.
           Jehana               | okay, just simply because it is slightly
    different than the one i remembr.
           O'Dubhain            | This Spell was used by the Druid to
    overcome the winds raised by the de Danaans in their battle for the
    Land.  It is an example of the way a Druid would work.  There are other
    tales of shamanistic workings by Druids
           Freepowder           | ?
           O'Dubhain            | Among these is "How the Tain was Recover-
    ed" Yes FP?
           Freepowder           | you spoke of becoming, is Amergin actualy
    3149

    becoming... those things or, has he been in the past?
           Nan                  | or is it a metaphor?
           O'Dubhain            | He is actually synchronizing himself with
    the spirit that controls these items.  It is a series of symbols. It can
    be viewed metaphorically.  But the fact is it got results.  The wind
    died and the Gaels landed on Ireland.
           Freepowder           | ok GA
           O'Dubhain            | Present day shamans do the same thing. 
    The story of the Tain was lost and had to be recovered.  It had been
    written in Oghams on sticks and sent to Italy.  None of the bards had a
    memory of the entire story, so they sent two men to recover the Oghams,
    Senchan and Muirgen.  No one knew where to look for these Ogham sticks. 
    So Muirgen decided to ask Fergus mac Roich (only one problem---Fergus
    was dead) So Muirgen slept on his grave and invoked the ghost of Fergus
    to reveal the entire story.  The Spirit of Fergus appeared in a cloud
    and for three days recited the entire epic.  Muirgen was able to go back
    to the Bards and tell the entire tale.  This tale was written down and
    we have it today.  This is an example of dream traveling to discover
    hidden knowledge
           Artemisia            | ?
           O'Dubhain            | yes Artemisia?

           O'Dubhain            | gotta be! <wiping eyes> Anyway the point
    is Druids did Magick in a lot of ways that has to be discovered again
    from studying these tales.  Native Americans pass this kind of know-
    ledge down from teacher to student.  We are not so lucky. We have to dig
    it out of books and figure out the symbolisms!
           Sue Thornburg        | Unless we have an O'Dubh and a computer.

    mercury) going to repeat it
           O'Dubhain            | and as based upon the Oghams in Nigel
    Pennicks "Magical Alphabets" is the Way of Protection.  This Way has the
    Oghams B L F S N on it from the outside to the center.  Each Ogham on
    this Path teaches us a Magickal ability.  The first Ogham B stands for
    3150

    the tree Birch--The White Tree of Purity and Purification.
           Jehana               | B is birch in the norse runes, too.  
           O'Dubhain            | It is used to protect and Purify us before
    we start our journey within.  It was the first Ogham ever used. It
    warned Lugh that his wife was going to be abducted to the Underworld and
    it will serve to show us that we are protected. Life springs anew.  To
    make such a journey one should meditate and cleanse oneself of all
    unclean and impure thoughts. 
          Beth Campbell        | (sounds like Eve and the Apple)
           O'Dubhain            | Native Americans might do this in a "sweat
    lodge".  more of a putting away of the mundane bagage of life. baggage
    that is !<G>  Make an Out of Body (OOBE) type of Journey to a White tree
    shining against a totally Black Darkness.  Use its image to purge your
    mind of distracting thoughts and go to the next level ---The Tree of
    Life.  Upon this tree one learns to shield unwanted psychic energies and
    Magicks. This Ogham is "L" for Rowan. When one is floating in an OOBE
    one needs such shielding to travel safely.

           O'Dubhain            | It would take an entire workshop.

           Fea'dog              | it does me!
           O'Dubhain            | Red is the color of life and frees us from
    conflicts and shields us in our lives.  Once we are pure and can shield
    and have no inner conflicts, it is time to learn of Magick itself!  The
    next step or Ogham is The Moon.  It is the letter "S" for the White
    Willow.  This is a form of the Goddess and leads us in Divinations to
    guide our future travels on the Wheel.  The last or inner Ogham on this
    path is "N".  It represents the Keys to inner Knowledge that we have
    gained.  It is the Black Ash.
           Rachel               | hello
           O'Dubhain            | It also gives us the insight "as Above so
    Below".
           Jehana               | hello.
           Rachel               | what is the subject?
           O'Dubhain            | All our previous insights will aid us in
    the physical and the astral worlds.  Rachel, this is a Workshop on
    Celtic Magick.  These keys and knowledge must grow like seeds within us. 
    In the future, they allow us to work our Power, the Earth's Power and
    the Power of the Spirit.  This completes the Way of Protection. I
    suggest that each of you try such a journey on your own, in a Circle or
    Safe quiet place.  Learn the symbols for the Oghams from the tables in
    3151

    the library (there are about 7 there I think).  Shamanistic journeys are
    very individualized.  Use symbols that have meaning to You.  To complete
    the journey around Fionns Wheel would cover the entire year and the
    Major festivals. 
           Nan                  | is that the next workshop, the festivals?
    <g>
           O'Dubhain            | Really project yourselves into the Wheel
    and you will find your own inner guide and Truth.
           Beth Campbell        | (sorry)
           O'Dubhain            | Nan>I think that'd be a good one The Major
    festivals are Imbolc Beltane Lughnasadh Samhain The Solstices and the
    Equinoxes Each of these can be found on the Wheel.  I hope that I wasn't
    too sketchy on this!<G>
           Nan                  | this medium is a bit slow and time
    consuming to cover this kind of stuff
           O'Dubhain            | I know my typing can stand improvement.
           Artemisia            | You were very good...<sigh> but I don't
    think I'm ever going to get this. 
           O'Dubhain            | John Matthews covers shamanism fully in
    his Book
           Nan                  | can you pre-type any and use cut and
    paste, that might help
           O'Dubhain            | "Celtic Shamanism". I could but then we
    lose spontaneity and dialogue.
           Nan                  | we could still be spontaneous in the
    discussion, but the information portion we're all being quiet anyway
           O'Dubhain            | Hey!  Ok! Next time lends itself to
    uploading on the festivals. <g>  I would like you each to consider
    making a shamanistic journey and messaging me about it.

    same time as a rebirth of interest in the occult and Druids.
           Pietra               | It is interesting that along with some of
    the rest of us the inquisistion tortured and put to death all Masons
    they could find.
           O'Dubhain            | Might have members in both paths.
           Artemisia            | hmmmm
           Pietra               | they certainly do --I am one
           O'Dubhain            | Sounds like they were intent on eliminat-
    ing anyone that thought for themselves.  Might have to talk to my uncles
    about this.  They are Masons.  But those guys are very secretive ! Just
    like Druids!<G>
           Pietra               | Oh good
           Artemisia            | Yes, they are <G>                  
           O'Dubhain            | Anyway, Thanks to all!
           Artemisia            | Thanks to YOU!
           O'Dubhain            | Gotta sleep and catch a plane!<G>
           Pietra               | bye y'all
           O'Dubhain            | See you all tommorrow! Hugs all around!
           Artemisia            | tomorrow?

    CELTIC WORKSHOP 3 - CELTIC FESTIVALS

    This an edited transcript of the Third Celtic Workshop presented by
    Searles O'Dubhain. The topic for the evening was scheduled to be
    the Major Celtic yearly festivals and their hidden meanings. Oghams
    were used to attempt to discovery the magick and Mystery within each
    festival.

    (2-9,Bianca)    hi pietra
    (2-9,Bianca)    hi jehana 
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) The Celts celebrated 8 major festivals during the year.
    Four of these festivals are associated with the Sun and four are tied to
    the phases of the Moon.
     
    I will briefly discuss the Lunar or Fire Festivals first.
     
    The Celtic year is divided into halves marked by the two great fire
    festivals of Samhain and Beltane. The period from Samhain to Beltain
    is(2-9,Bianca) sid and mindy called "an Ghrian beag" or the "lessor
    Sun".  The period from Beltain to Samhain is called "an Ghrian mor" or
    the "greater Sun". The year is further subdivided by the other two
    yearly fire festivals of Imbolc and Lughnesadh.All of the fire festivals
    are celebrated at night and are held during the Full Moon. They are
    primarily concerned with agriculture, nature, pasturing and livestock. 
     
    (2-1,Freepowder)?  
                    
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Samhain is the begining of the Celtic year and marks the
    time of the Cailleach and the begining of Winter. The doors of the Sidhe
    are opened on this night and the veil between the Worlds is thinnest.
    This is the night that Druids offered sacrifices (usually the excess
    cattle that would form the basis of the Winter's meat stores). This is
    the time that the Ancestors walk the Earth once more and cross the thin
    veil to visit with the living. Samhain is associated with the province
    of Munster and the fortress of Tlachtga.
                     
    Beltane marks the begining of Summer and is dedicated to the "Shining
    One:" or Bel. Two large bonfires were ignited and cattle were driven
    between the fires and into the fields for Summer pasturing. This was
    also done to purify them from their long Winter confinement. Men and
    women were known to leap through the flames for purification at these
    fire festivals.  Usually the men first then the women (and after the
    flames had diminished!<g>).  This night is the time when the Sidhe walk 
    the land and mortals must overcome their Otherworldly enchantments and
    temptations.   Beltane was the time when divorces were granted in
    Ireland as well as a night of release from the Winter. This festival was
    3156

    associated with the province of Connacht and the fortress of Uisneach.
     
    In ancient Ireland an additional two fire festivals were celebrated:
    Lughnasadh and the feast of Tara (celebrated every 3 years).
     
    Lughnasadh was the time of the first harvest and a time of games and
    competitions. It is associated with the Goddess of Sovereignty.  The God
    Lugh held this festival to celibrate the efforts of his fostermother
    Tailtiu to clear the fields of Ireland for planting.  It was also the
    time when couples could enter into a "trial marriage" known as a Brehon 
    wedding. The couple would clasp hands and thrust them through a circular
    opening in a special stone, while announcing to the Brehons (judges and
    lawyers) that they intended to live together for a one year trial
    period. Either party could break the marriage by a public announcement
    during the feast of Beltane. This festival lasted for a month! The feast
    of Tara was held every three years to distribute laws and gather
    records.
     
    An additional festival was added later.  This is Imbolc and was held in
    Leinster to celebrate the Goddess Brigit. This festival marks the ending
    of Winter's grip and the passing of the influence of the Crone or
    Cailleach to the Maiden of Spring. It is the time of the first lambs and
    of new beginings. Brigit's sacred flame was tended in Leinster in a
    sacred center for female Druids. This festival was usually one of the
    home and the hearth and was usually presided  over by the female head of
    the house.
     
    The Sun festivals are MidWinter and MidSummer Solstices as well as the
    Spring and Vernal Equinoxes. These festivals mark periods of greatest
    imbalance between the Sun and the Moon as well as the periods of
    greatest balance. Not much is known about how these Sun festivals were
    celebrated by the Celts, if at all. One source I've read claims they 
    are evidence of Anglo-Saxon influences on later Celtic life and
    practice. Most authors state that only the lunar festivals were publicly
    celebrated (at least by the Irish).  Perhaps the Druids used the Solar
    days for Magick and Divination. I am still researching these celebrat-
    ions and am not prepared to discuss them in detail this evening.
     
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Perhaps we should discuss the previous presentation
    before we get to the Magickal meaning of the Lunar festivals?
     
    FP>ga
    (2-1,Freepowder)you answered it <G>
    (2-7,O'Dubhain)  Ok I know this was a long spiel but now we can discuss
    it.
         The following pieces are much shorter with more room for discussion
    (2-1,Freepowder)?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain)  FP>ga
    (2-29,Nan)       ?
    (2-1,Freepowder)the festivals I have herard of samhain etc. are solar?
    (2-1,Freepowder)but not agreed upon?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain)  The Solar festivals are not really ancient Celtic
    public festivals.
    (2-1,Freepowder)GA
    (2-3,Pietra)     !
    (2-7,O'Dubhain)  Samhain is a lunar festival.  But More research must be
    done on the Solar festivals. ga FP
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)Are the Solar festivals mentioned at all in Greek or
    3157

    Roman chronicles as Celtic festival days?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain)  Kenneth >Will get to that question in a minute.
                     Fp>done?
    (2-1,Freepowder)GA
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Nan>ga
    (2-29,Nan)      two questions, how are the lunar holidays determined
    (dates) and what is the connection of 
    (2-29,Nan)      the Sidhe with Beltane?
    (2-29,Nan)      ga
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Nan>I'll answer those in the following presentation.
    Pietra>ga       ok
    (2-3,Pietra)    didn't the people also jump the bonfires?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Pietra>Yes they did. And sometimes they were sacrificed
    in them But that was very long ago.  The Human sacrifice was replaced by
    animal and agricultural sacrifices.
    Kenneth>The Romans influenced the Britains and also the Vikings and
    Anglo-Saxons  This is where the Sun festivals come from although they
    could have been Druid ceremonies closed to the public.
    Kenneth>ga
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)Hmmm...I see.  So as far as readily evident public
    festival information goes, 
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)the Solar festivals are recent -- at least in the sense
    of "post-Roman?"
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth>Yes I believe so. These festivals are part of
    the Wiccan year.  Because Wicca embraces soo many diff backgrounds and
    deities.  anyway I'm going to talk a little about the Magickal sig-
    nificance of these holidays and festivals now.  We will use the Oghams
    from Fionn's Wheel to get an inkling of what was really going on during
    these festivals.  Any other questions before I start?

    ok From the "Crane Bag" of Mannanan mac Lyr The Festival of Imbolc
    (First Full Moon in Aquarius) The Feast of the Goddess Brigit.
     
                    Ogham Symbol "EA":
                    Koad or Eadha the Sacred Grove
                    Death (Tarot).
                    Unity of the Eight Festivals of the Year.
                    The Wheel of the Year.
                    forty shades of green.
     
     
                    Interpretation and Meanings:
     
         This is the festival of new beginings.  This is the time when most
    new life came forth (first shoots of spring, lambs and the childern that
    were sired at Beltain).  A celebration of the Triple Goddess, showing
    the passage of winter and the advent of summer. The Time of the Maiden
    who bridges the gap from the Dark Queen of the UnderWorld to the Red
    Mother of Life and Plenty.  The Mystery here is the unity of Death and
    Life through the Promise of the rebirth of the Green World as represen-
    ted by Brigit, the Maiden of the hearth, the home, poets and the forge.
    Imbolc is the time of divination, augury and seeking of new directions
    for the year.  I believe that Imbolc is a carry over from an earlier
    Goddess religion in Ireland.
                    Discussion or questions anyone?
    (2-1,Freepowder)?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) FP>ga
    (2-1,Freepowder)Brigit did poets, who did musicians? <G>
    3158

    (2-1,Freepowder)GA
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Well the Dagdha played a mean harp.  And Lugh was
    multi-talented.
    (2-1,Freepowder)LOL 
    (2-1,Freepowder)no "patron saint" of musicians?
    (2-1,Freepowder)GA
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Well Taliesin was the king of Bards And was the greatest
    of musicians as well.  So he would be your God of Musicians.
    (2-1,Freepowder)he was welsh! Amergin maybe? <G> 
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Amergin was also a great bard.  He seems to be Talies-
    in's counterpart.  Ok on to Betaine!
         From the "Crane Bag" of Mannanan mac Lyr The Festival of Beltain
    (First Full Moon after the Hawthorne's bloom)  The Feast of Bel and the
    twin bonfires.
     
                    Ogham Symbol "OI":
                    Oir Spi'ona'n Eirinen Fair.
                    Childbirth.
                    The Spindle of the Wheel.
                    White or Red.
     
                    Interpretation and Meanings:
     
    This is the festival of life. On this day, the sacred fires were lit on
    the hill of Tara. Fires were lit on hills across Ireland when the signal
    fire was observed until the land was surrounded in a circle of fire.
    Beltain marks the begining of summer when the land is filled with
    plenty. This a time when the ways between the worlds are open and the
    Sidhe are most likely to grant gifts to those who seek them early in the 
    morning. It is also a time that is central to the entire cycle of
    agriculture. It is now when the promise of spring is fulfilled. The
    Maypole symbolises the fertility rites of this festival. Strange that
    the red and white streamers of the Maypole should remind us of the DNA
    Helix of Life. Life is the Spindle and Love is the weave. In Ireland
    the people dance around a burning bush in a "serpent" dance. Beltaine is
    the time of our maturity and the fulfillment of desires.
     
                    Questions or should I go on?
    (2-1,Freepowder)?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) FP>ga
    (2-1,Freepowder)Bel was the god of the dead?...
    (2-1,Freepowder)and this was a festival of life? GA
    (2-1,Freepowder)<G> Ok
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) There is controversy over whether Belenus is really the
    God for whom this festival is named.  But Belenus, Bael, Bile and Beil
    are all names associted with this festival. Some of theses are Sun Gods
    eg "Shining Ones" Irish sources say this that Beltaine really means
    Great Fires!<G>
    (2-29,Nan)      ?  Nan>ga
    (2-5,JUAN)      HELLO EVERYBODY
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Juan Standby please Co in progress
    (2-29,Nan)      what if there's no Hawthorn around? how do you know when
    this festival is?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Nan>It's commonly called May Day in Western Europe.
    That's May 1 or the closet Full Moon to May 1.
    (2-29,Nan) ok
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) That's the first full moon in Taurus.
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)?
    3159

    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth>ga
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)Beltane seems to be characterized by masculine symbols
    -- was it a special day for men, such as entrance to manhood festivals,
    or such?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth>It was a day of festivities for both men and
    women It's also associated with the first Battle of Moytura.  Women and
    men both fought in that battle.
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)<nod> Was there any particular ascent to adulthood
    ritual in Celtic festivities?
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)I see...
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) All the festivals were used as rites of initiation since
    this was a time of gathering of the clans.  many times a boy would be
    initiated by graduating from warrior training or bardic training he
    could then demonstrate his prowess.  
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)Ah...I see.  So anything involving community could be
    done on those days (including Bhar Mitzvas :D)?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Something like that! and also lots of games and
    competitions.

    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Pressing on  here From the "Crane Bag" of Mannanan mac
    Lyr
     
     
                    The Festival of Lughnasadh
                    (First Full Moon in Leo)
                    The Feast of the God Lugh.
     
                    Ogham Symbol "UI":
                    Uinllean Fea' Ffawyddean Beech or Phagos.
                    Chieftain.
                    Magickal Hardness and Resistance.
                    Ancient Wisdom as a foundation.
                    Tawny or light roebuck.
     
                    Interpretation and Meanings:
     
    This festival is linked to many ancient practices in Ireland. Contracts,
    marriages and other binding agreements were made on this day. This is
    the day of the Marriage of Lugh. It is also the day when the performance
    of the clan chiefs was evaluated and perhaps a new chief was chosen.
    This is the time of the great horse fair and fittingly enough the
    marriage of the King to the land. This could sometimes involve a ritual
    whereby the new king was symbollically mated with a horse, Symbolizing
    the Goddess of Sovereignty. The first harvest had already been reaped.
     
                    Ogham Symbol "IO":
                    Pethbol Guelder Rose
                    The step into the Inner Mysteries.
                    Pink or Pale.
                    The dance of life.
                    The Crane Dance.
     
                    Interpretation and Meanings:
     
    Since this festival is linked to the young god Lugh that replaces the
    older god Nuada, it is also linked to the mysteries as Lugh is "Samil-
    danach" or "multi-talented". It is very possible that a series of
    examinations was given to Druidic students on this day, corresponding to
    3160

    the series of tests that Lugh had to pass in competitions with the other
    Gods before he was admitted to their company. One such contest is in the
    throwing of stones or chariot wheels that occurred during the weeks of
    this fair. Another is the playing of board games at this time such as
    "fidchell", a game played with wooden pieces (possibly Oghams) and
    similar we are told to chess. My own opinion is that it was a kind of
    divination. The point here being that just as Lugh proved himself worthy
    to join the company of the Gods by being "Samildanach", so I interpret
    this symbol to imply that new Druids were admitted to the  inner
    mysteries and Circles by passing their tests during this festival.
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Questions?
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth!>ga
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)Sorry...just one little thing I've always wondered --
    Fidchell, and games like it in other celtic groups, are mentioned
    frequently in literature and legend.  Are there any surviving fidchell
    sets?  How is information known about the game?

    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth>Not much is known about the game.  No sets
    survive but it must have been something!  Everyone was playing it!<G>
    more? ga
    (2-17,Kenneth 23)No...that's all, thanks!
    (2-1,Freepowder)O'D? GA
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) ok

                    Shower of the Way.
                    Marker of the Ley Lines.
                    Bringer of Illumination.
                    The Container of Wisdom,
                    The Sacred Pine Cone, Buarci'n.
                    Spirit.
                    The Sea. Green or Black.
     
     
                    Interpretation and Meanings:
     
    There are many meanings to this symbol. The first is the Sea represen-
    ting the darkest depths and also the source of all life.  The mystery
    here is that as life ends, so it begins in the same place and from the
    same source, the Sea (or Otherworld for which it is a symbol).  This
    celebration honored the Night of the Dead, when the ancestors walked the
    Earth once more and the ancient knowledge could be re-acquired.  It also
    celebrated the mating of the Dagdha with the Morrigan, the Queen of
    Death and Darkness, the Washer at the Ford. She gives the Dagdha the 
    advice to assemble the Aes Dana or skilled ones and to advance upon the
    Fomorians at Maige Turedh. The Goddess of War then goes to kill the King
    of the Fomorians (Indech mac De Domnann) in his tent at Scetne. The
    Second Battle of Maige Turedh (Moytura) is won by the De Danaans on
    Samhain.  I interpret this story of the Dagdha (The All Father)with the
    Goddess of Darkness (The Triple Morrigan) to mean that the will of the
    One was united in the Power of Dark and Light to be used during this
    3161

    "gray time" of twilight. The Spiritual aspects overcome the Mental and
    Physical aspects (the Fomorians and  the Firbolgs, defeated in the first
    Battle of Maige Turedh) to claim the Land and ALL that is. The victory
    of the Spirit assures us that the Wheel will turn eternally and that the
    three aspects of humanity are forged together through the two battles of
    Maige Turedh. Please read Steve Blamires's excellent interpretations in
    his work "The Irish Celtic Magical Tradition". This last marriage of the
    Dagdha and Morrigan also represents the mystery of life from death. 
    I believe that to be the Ultimate Mystery of Druidism or any other
    religion.
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) questions?
    (2-1,Freepowder)?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Fp>ga
    (2-1,Freepowder)did the Irish believe in reincarnation? GA
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Yes they did. They believed that when you were re-incar-
    nated, it would hold true to the bloodlines.  Like maybe you are your
    great grandfather or grand mother re-incarnated!<G>
    (2-1,Freepowder)not "karmic" then?
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) Not a great deal of karma there.  They did hold each
    accountable for their life's actions.  
    (2-1,Freepowder)what about if you are adopted? <VBG>
    (2-7,O'Dubhain) he Irish also believed in "fosterage" so that you became
    "blood brothers".  So I suppose you could re-incarnate in someone else
    that way!<G>

    (2-8,O'Dubh) Ok let's get started!
    (2-11,Nan)  <ptuie> 'scuse me <g>
     
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Before I begin let me say a few words about how the
    Workshop is conducted.  We will first hear from a presenter, tonight
    that is me. If you have a question type in a ? and I will acknowledge
    you by tyoing "ga" at and appropriate time.  When you have finished your
    question type "ga" to let me know that I may respond. When
    we are finished I will acknowledge the next questioner in a similar
    manner. If you have a comment or additional information to provide
    on a topic, please use the "!" to signal me.  I will also cycle through
    those with comments in a similar manner. If their are no questions at
    this point I will begin tonight's presentation.
    (2-5,Seanchai) ?
    (2-8,O'Dubh) The topics I plan to cover tonight are:
     
    3165

                    Music and Magick in general.
                    Role of Bards and Druids in Celtic Music.
                    Aradach Fionn, Tree tones and associations
                    Some example folk songs and interpretations.
    (2-8,O'Dubh)   Seanchai ga.
    (2-5,Seanchai) Patience is a virtue I need to learn in a hurry.
    (2-5,Seanchai) I was going to ask, what's tonight's topic.
    (2-8,O'Dubh)   ok !<G>
    (2-5,Seanchai) Ga
    (2-20,O'Ba'n)  LOL!
    (2-11,Nan)     lol
    (2-9,Rose)     ditto

    (2-8,O'Dubh) Anyone that has ever done Magick knows that it involves
    resonances and associations.  Magick has many color associations as well
    as musical associations. We have all experienced the magick of music in
    contemporary music. Sometimes this can be in the form of attending
    a concert, othertimes it can be when we are alone and listening to our
    favorites tunes.  Modern day religious services take advantage of the
    Magick inherit to music to enhance their worship services. This can be
    in singing hymns or hearing organ and choral anthems. I'm sure that we
    will all agree that music in such sitruarions alters our state of being.
    We are uplifted and changed by the ritual music we experience.  It
    should be no surprise that the ancient Celts used music in a similar
    manner.  In Morgan Llwellyn's "Druids" we find an example of such a
    Druidic use of music in Magick.  The chief Druid of a village would
    greet the Sun with song and lead the village each day in welcoming the
    Sun back from the Underworld.  When the Sun set, another farewell song
    was enjoined. This practice is still followed by some in Celtic lands to
    this day. Examples of such incantations and greetings to the Sun
    may be found in the "Carmenica Gadetica" a vast resources of ancient and
    rercent Celtic verse and song.
     
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Please pardon the typos!<G>  In many Magick systems, Words
    of Power using the names of the Gods are used to create resonances
    within the Magical Circle so that the Magicians may attain a higher
    state of awareness. The use of these words also serves to open the
    internal "Power Centers" or "Chakras" of the participants.  These
    godnames are constructed using the letters of the Magickal alphabets of
    the respective Magickal systems as well as the natural tones  and the
    corresponding resonances that are associated with each letter or symbol.
                 For example:
            
                    YHVH Yud Heh Vahv He  
                    (a Kaballistic godname)
     
    (2-8,O'Dubh) An incantaion of a godname becomes a chant with its own
    inherent melody and rhythm. Such sounds generated form an occult
    alphabet are thought by Magicians to have inherit Power in their sounds
    and to generate Magickal resonances within the Magician and the Circle.
    It is my belief that the ancient Celts and Druids used music and sounds
    from their secret Ogham alphabet to aid them in working Magick in a
    similar manner.  
     
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Druidic Bards studied for 15 to 20 years to learn the
    epics, chants, spells and histories of their peoples and clans. These
    works were memorized exactly and were a requirement for advancement to
    a higher or inner level of the Druidic ranks. The works had to be 
    3166

    rendered with feeling so that the listener  would be spell bound and
    consequently could relive the event.  The Irish Druids had the following
    classes of Bards:
     
                     Class          # of Epics
                     __________________________________________ 
     
                     Driseg         20   (the Beginner)
                     Foclaic        30   (Advanced beginner)
                     Cili           100  (Journeyman)
                     Anraid         175  (Master/Warrior)
                     Ollomh         175+ (Doctor/Judge)
     
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Bards learned to play the pipes, the whistle, the harp, the
    lyre, the flute, the sistrum and the bodrun among other instruments.
    According to Murry Hope these instruments, were used based upon the mood
    or tone that the particular Bardic work required. He gives a table of
    the following correspondences:
            
                        The Flute   -  Air   (later the Organ)
                        The Harp    -  Water
                        The Sistrum -  Earth (The Bells or Bodrun)
                        The Lyre    -  Fire
     
    Poets and Bards carried branches with bells and amulets attached to
    them. A beginner's branch would be bronze, journeymen carried a silver
    branch and the Master Bards carried a golden branch. The music of the
    bells would announce the Bard's presence and an impending performance.
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Nan ga
    (2-11,Nan)   what's a sistrum?
    (2-11,Nan)   ga
    (2-8,O'Dubh) It's a stringed instrument that one beats I believe. 
    Anyone got an opinion?
    (2-2,Rilla)  Ray confirms that.
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) ?
    (2-2,Rilla)  Precursor of the lute maybe?
    (2-8,O'Dubh) perhaps.
    (2-9,Rose)   I understand that one shakes it like Isis does in the
    pictures.
    (2-22,Wren)  Similar to a hammered dulcimer?
    (2-8,O'Dubh) That's what I was thinking, Wren.
    (2-11,Nan)   or a tambourine?
    (2-9,Rose)   I have a picture of one...
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Rose ga
    (2-9,Rose)   it looks like a tennis racket.
    (2-9,Rose)   with hooks.
    (2-8,O'Dubh) And you beat it right?
    (2-9,Rose)   I think so.
    (2-8,O'Dubh) ok Nan any further questions?
    (2-11,Nan)   got it, thanks
    (2-9,Rose)   shake it.
    (2-20,O'Ba'n)an ancient metal frame with numerous metal rods that jingle
    when shaken, websters.
    (2-9,Rose)   bravo.
    (2-8,O'Dubh) great! 
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) ?
    (2-11,Nan)    no, ga
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  O'ba'n?
    3167

    (2-8,O'Dubh)  ok let's roll!
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) wait
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  O'ban ga!
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) are the instruments dedicated to...
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) their various areas based on the tonal range they cover
    or...
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) the quality of the sound?
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) ga
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  It's the quality of the sound mostly.  The same way they
    would be scored in an orchestra for instance.  
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) ok.
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) ga
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  ga
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) no, you ga!
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) <G>|
    (2-8,O'Dubh) My own belief is that the Bards usually accompanied
    themselves with the harp as they recited their repertorie. Just as
    Oghams were used as keys to memory with verses being linked by assonance
    and alliteration, I believe that each Ogham had a unique tone or note
    associated with it on the harp.  The tone or string was struck as the
    Ogham sound was spoken or sung two notes per line.  The begining and
    ending notes serving to connect each line to the next line in a
    continuing stream.  In the world of my my imagination I can hear the
    tones and words of the Bards echoing as they float upon a wave of melody
    acroos the room.  The sound reminds me of chanting monks or the 
    plainsong of worship (similar to modern Anglican or Roman Catholic
    Plainsong).
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Sean O'Boyle, a late Irish scholar, made an attempt to
    interpret "Aradach Fionn" (Fionn's Ladder) as harp tabulature using
    Oghams. He suggested that the Irish practice harp that has only 20
    strings has a 1 to 1 correspondence to the first 20 Oghams. As far as I
    know,no records survived to reach us verifying his theory. It seems to
    make sense to me but I only speculate.
     
    (2-8,O'Dubh) A modern work "Trees for Healing" by Chase and Pawlik,
    reinforces this belief for me. This book is all about trees, their lore
    and their spirits. It describes techniques for meditation to determine
    the harmonic resonaces for a variety of trees. I believe that the
    ancient Druids also detected certain harmonic tones for each tree and
    used then in their Tree Ogham Alphabet. If we use the tones that have
    been rediscovered by Chase and Pawlik and combine them with the ancient
    chants, incantations and songs of Taliesin and Amergin, we may also be
    able to work powerful Magicks. This Magick can take any form from
    enchanting an audience to calling the winds.  The Greek Bard Orpheus was
    able to walk between the worlds in this manner and so can we.  I list
    the trees and the derived modern tonal correspondences below:

    (2-8,O'Dubh) Some of these tones were derived by meditation and
    resonance, some are based upon the colors associated with the Oghams. My
    suggestion is to
    (2-11,Nan)   ?
    (2-8,O'Dubh) find such a tree yourself and to meditate under it. play a
    pipe, a whistle or a harp (even a guitar will do in a pinch!<G>) until
    you find 
    (2-22,Wren)  ?
    (2-20,O'Ba'n)?
    3169

                 the correct tone for the tree.  Other tones will reflect
    from the tree.  The "soul tone" of the tree will be absorbed and you
    will possibly feel a tingle of energy that is released by the Spirit of
    the Tree.  This experience is somewhat akin to the common belief in
    Ireland (even today) that a particularily gifted musician, harper or
    piper has been taught by the Sidhe (famed for their enchanted music).
    Celts believe in harmony and rightness in all things and particularily
    in Nature.
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Nan ga
    (2-11,Nan)   I noticed that many different oghams had the same note...
    are these the same notes or are they in differing octaves? ga
    (2-8,O'Dubh) The table I presented is not cast in stone!<G>
    (2-11,Nan)   or even in wood? <G> 
    (2-8,O'Dubh) The first approach has each ogham on a different tone For
    Fionn's ladder for instance.  The second approach used meditation
    techniques to determine the "soul tones" of the trees Some trees
    evidently have a similar feel to them.  I think that the table needs
    some work myself.  Perhaps one of the more musically gifted members
    could undertake such a study!
    (2-24,da Medic) ?
    (2-8,O'Dubh) ?<G>
    (2-8,O'Dubh) ga Nan
    (2-8,O'Dubh) additional questions?
    (2-8,O'Dubh) If not then Wren was next.
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) !
    (2-11,Nan)   no, i think wren had some though
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  Wren ga
    (2-22,Wren)   Already answered, thanks.  Gotta go, g'nite!
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  Sla'n Wren!
    (2-11,Nan)    g'night wren
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  O'ba'n ga
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) need to have the transmogrification of what tree is which
    out west for me to do it...
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) but with that I'd love to do the tree/tone thing!
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  Ok I'll put a table in the library this week.
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) GA
    (2-24,da Medic) does this explain the prevalence of willow/oak in celtic
    magicks?  ga.
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) Cool!
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  da Medic ga
    (2-24,da Medic) sorry, saw the ga.
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Yes it does to some extent.  I have entire books on nothing
    but healing properties of trees.  I'm sure Druids knew much more.
    (2-11,Nan) ?
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Nan ga
    (2-11,Nan)   could you please post a bibliography of some of those
    books??? (pretty please?)
    (2-11,Nan)   ga
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Ok will do that as well this week!<G>
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) yes! yes!

    (2-8,O'Dubh) Now to continue...
                 Some of this Magick comes down to us today in the form of
    folk songs still sung in the outer reaches of Ireland and the British
    Isles.  Such a song is the "Padstow May Song" from  Padstow, Cornwall
    (in part):
     

    3170

                    "Unite and unite and let us unite
                    For summer is acome unto day
                    And whither we are going we will all unite
                    In the merry morning of May."
     
                    "I warn you young men everyone
                    To go into the greenwood and 
                    fetch your May home."
     
                    "Arise up Mr. _______ and joy you betide
                    And bright is your bride that lies 
                    by your side."
     
                    "Arise up Mrs. _______ and gold be your ring
                    And give to us a cup of ale the merrier 
                    we shall sing."
     
                    "Arise up Miss ______ all in your gown of green
                    You are as fine a lady as wait upon the Queen."
     
                    "Now fare you well, and we bid you 
                    all good cheer

                    We call once more unto your house 
                    before another year."

    (2-8,O'Dubh) I interpret this song to mean this:
     
                 This song is sung on Beltaine and is said to 
                 charge the atmosphere of the festival. It 
                 symbolizes the marriage of the youth with
                 the land. (Unite and unite and let us unite)
     
                 It also adresses 3 individuals: A man, a
                 woman and a Maiden in a green gown
                 (who represents Nature).
     
                 This song is sung around the May Pole or   
                 May bonfires in the evening (and prior to
                 anyone escaping to the outer folds of 
                 darkness for an evening of bliss <g>).

    ................................................................................
    3171

    (2-8,O'Dubh) Another ancient folk song that has hidden meanings of
    Magick is the song "Green Grow the Rushes":
     
                 " One of them is all alone and 
                 ever more shall be so.
                 Two of them are lily-white boys 
                 all clothed all in green Oh!
                 Three of them are strangers o'er the 
                 wide world they are rangers.
                 Four it is the Dilly Hour when 
                 blooms the Gilly Flower.
                 Five it is the Dilly Bird that's 
                 seldom seen but heard.
                 Six is the Ferryman in the boat that 
                 o'er the river floats, Oh!
                 Seven are the Seven Stars in the Sky, 
                 the Shining Stars be Seven, Oh!
                 Eight it is the Morning's break when 
                 all the World's awake, Oh!
                 Nine it is the pale Moonshine, 
                 the shining Moon is nine, Oh!
                 Ten Forgives all kinds of Sin, 
                 from Ten begin again, Oh! "
     
    (2-8,O'Dubh) This song can be interpreted to mean:
     
                 1. There is One Power.
     
                 2. The God has two aspects (Light and Dark).
     
                 3. The Celts are a wadering people with
                    the sacred number of "3".
     
                 4. The 4th Ogham is the Alder sacred to Bran
                    the Blessed and his sister Branwen "the
                    Gilly Flower".
     
                 5. The Wizard Merlin as well as the sacred
                    number of the Celtic Gods (not to mention
                    the number of points on a Pentagram).
     
                 6. Keridwen's Coracle that ferries us to
                    the Underworld.
     
                 7. The sacred number of sea gods and the stars
                    in the crown of Arianrhod.
     
                 8. The number of judgement or resurrection.
     
                 9. The Triple Moon Goddess Thrice emphasized
                    The number of Priestesses that guard the 
                    Cauldron of Rebirth.
     
                 10.The necessity to find our "True Selves"
                    in order to understand the Inner Mysteries. 
                    The endless cycle of death and rebirth.

    (2-20,O'Ba'n) this is your interpretation? 
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) GA
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  It is also Murry Hope's interpretation.  I have seen a
    different version of this song.
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) <patting self on back> suits me! GA
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  that is used by OATh coven and had hoped that perhaps they
    would be here tonight.
    (2-24,da Medic) !

    (2-8,O'Dubh) da Medic ga
    (2-24,da Medic) Cunningham also had summat similar ga.

    Fire water ga
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Ok I have that one here will check in a min.  let's finish
    up a bit first!
    (2-8,O'Dubh) Perhaps some of you have some ancient or even modern Celtic
    folk songs that you would like to share with us this evening? You could
    enter them here and we could discuss them in detail or maybe just take
    them to our hearts and embrace their inner messages (for Celtic Music is
    a music of the Heart and Soul). I know that many of you are very into
    Celtic Music. I'd like to have each of us contribute the names and
    titles of our favorite performers and songss.
     
    (2-8,O'Dubh) My favorite song is the "Rising Of the Moon" by the Clancy
    Brothers and Tommy Liam.

    (2-8,O'Dubh) OB ga
    (2-24,da Medic)  gotta go do the work thing-Blesed Be! ga
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) that one is all about english occupation and resistance as
    related to a duck <G>
    (2-11,Nan)    lol
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  OB>I know it well (it's about a goose I thought)
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) how 'bout 5 (or 7) nights drunk!
    (2-11,Nan)    ?
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  But it's really about a man that was killed by the
    English.  They had to sing it in riddles to avoid being hanged.
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) O'D> and how we has plenty of relatives to take up the
    fight!
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  That's right. I am reading Trinity right now.  about the
    fight for home rule.
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  more favorites out there?
    (2-4,Da Shad) OD, went to an Irish festival this weekend...
    (2-2,Rilla)  <great book!>
    (2-4,Da Shad) and was really shocked at how strong a presense that the
    IRA had there, several booths for signing petitions and sending money to
    the IRA.  Pledges even!
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) "bad luck to the savage to grease his white cabbage that
    wantonly murdered me beautiful drake" BTW Drakes are male ducks...
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) Ganders are male geese <G>
    (2-11,Nan) <---going to the Chieftans next w'end <VBG>
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) <green>
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  Da Shad>They need to do something settle the issues up
    there.
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  OB>Yer right yer scoundrel.
                  :P~
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  Nan>great!
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  Any ideas about next week's Workshop?
    (2-4,Da Shad) If the IRA really wanted to get the brits out...
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  Hint hint hint!
    (2-4,Da Shad) they just need to blow up the shipyards in Northern
    Ireland.
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) I spoke to an Irishman who was probably in the IRA 
                  since he denied it...
    (2-4,Da Shad) Once there is no more economic value in northern ireland-
    ...
    (2-11,Nan)    how about a workshop on stone circles etc.
    (2-4,Da Shad) there owuld be no more need for the brits to keep troops
    there.
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) his theory was for the Brits to just pull out, I said
    "bloodbath would follow", he said...
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  Nan> Great idea!!
    (2-4,StonedAgain) Just call me stonie!  (g)
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) yes for 3-5 yrs then it would settle down and achieve
    normalcy with the rest of Ireland
    (2-11,Nan)    is this wkshp officially over? (loggin on long distance
    here)
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) one would guess <G>
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  yes Nan we're done for the night.
    (2-2,Rilla)   Nice job, Odie!
    (2-4,Shadow Hawk) Gee, didn't realize that there was a workshop going
    on, sorry.

    (2-8,O'Dubh)  "Hush me Buch all hush and listen and 
                  his cheeks were all a glow!"
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) Can't find it right now, was supposed to say "hush
    children" 
                  and "yes father"
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  "I bear orders from the captain, get you ready quick and

    (2-8,O'Dubh)  Mostly the fathers side though!
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) LOL!
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  However they did marry the Picts
                  and made them agree to trace lineage on the Mother's
    side!<G>
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) I heard somewhere they were matrilineal, since they were 
                  quite open sexualy
    (2-20,O'Ba'n) <G>
    (2-8,O'Dubh)  The women had a lot of different partners.
                  and the men went both ways
                  if you can believe a lyin Roman that is!<G>

                    Celtic Worshop #5 - The Celtic Otherworld

    This is the transcript of the fifth Celtic Workshop - The Celtic
    Otherworld.  We engaged in a brief period of socialization before and

    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) "Celtic Workshop #5 - The Otherworld"
     
    3181

    Before I begin let me say a few words about how the Workshop is
    conducted.  We will first hear from a presenter, tonight that is me. If
    you have a question type in a ? and I will acknowledge you by typing
    "ga" at and appropriate time.  When you have finished your question type
    "ga" to let me know that I may respond. When we are finished I will
    acknowledge the next questioner in a similar manner. If you have a
    comment or additional information to provide on a topic, please use the
    "!" to signal me.  I will also cycle through those with comments. If
    their are no questions at this point I will begin tonight's  presen-
    tation.
     
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) I would also like to apologize for not producing
    the list of tree correspondences this week that I promised to provide.
    Being on the road and away from home, I was not able to get to all my
    references about trees, herbs and the like. I haven't forgotten the
    promise however. I will post the list as soon as I return to Virginia
    this weekend. This list can be used together with certain meditation
    practices to determine the "soul tones" of the Tree Oghams. I did locate
    the Ogham/musical tone table of correspondences that I had mentioned in
    the Celtic Workshop #4. This table is by the Celtic scholar Dr. Sean
    O'Boyle:

    properties of our beings were associated with tone combinations:
     
                            The Body - Single tones
     
                            The Mind - Two tone intervals
     
                            The Spirit - Three tones at the same time
    (chords)
     
                    For more information on this subject, I recommend
    reading "The 21 Lessons of Merlin" by Douglas Adams (Llewellyn) or the
    Original work by O'Boyle: "Ogham: The Poet's Secret" (1980, Gilbert &
    Dalton Ltd., Dublin).
     
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) The beliefs of the Celts and their Magickal/Religious
    practices cannot be fully understood without becoming more familiar with
    their Cosmologies and Deities. In considering how to proceed with the
    Workshop, a variety of topics came to mind:
     
                            The Otherworld
                            The Gods and Goddesses
                            The Objects of Power
                            The Guardians of the Circle
                            The "Place Names" 
                            The "Totem Animals"

    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Subject of tonight's Celtic Workshop is The Celtic
    Otherworld.
     
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) The topics I plan to cover tonight are:
            
                            The Otherworld
                            The Gods and Goddesses
                            The Objects of Power
                            The Guardians of the Circle
     
     
    (2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Celtic Cosmology"
     
    The number three was sacred to the Celts and the Druids.  It should come
    as no surprise that the Celtic Cosmos is threefold: The Sky World, The
    Earth World and the Underworld. Each of these realms is associated with
    particular deities and Magickal acts or techniques.  
     
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Sky World was associated with the heavenly bodies:
    the Sun, the Moon, the stars. This is the realm of the Gods and
    Goddesses and is associated with the cycles and patterns of the Sky (and
    perhaps also associated with The Megalithic Stone Circles).  These
    visible objects were used as a basis for performing Higher Magicks such
    as: Prophecy and Astral travel. The cycles of the Sun and Moon also were
    used to determine the appropriate times for doing particular types of
    Magick. Festivals were held during Full Moons, Dark Moons, the 6th nite
    of the New Moon, Sunrise, Sunset and the 4 days of the Solar extremes;
    Mid Winter, Mid Summer and the Equinoxes. The heavenly bodies were not
    themselves considered to be Deities, but were thought to reflect or
    contain the types of Power associated with particular entities. The
    Fires of the Sun were associated with the forge and with inspiration,
    possibly making Brigid (An aspect of the Irish Celtic Triple Goddess)
    also a Sun Goddess. Bel or Belenus was usually associated with the
    powers of the Sun as well. 
     
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Underworld is the realm of the Ancestors, as well
    as former humans and a number of Gods and Goddesses associated with the
    mystery of life springing forth from death. This process could be as
    simple and mysterious as the life cycle of a seed. From old life, new
    life appears in a series of changes from planting and germination to
    growth and harvesting. The passage graves and burial customs of the
    Celts also reflect this expectation of rebirth and afterlife. Many tombs
    and burial sites show that Celts were buried with objects that they
    could take with them into the Underworld to be used in battle, in
    hunting and/or for nourishment. This practice appears to be similar to
    what was practiced by many ancient peoples, including the Egyptians.
    Celts did not fear death, they expected to live on and eventually be
    reborn in another life. The Underworld and the Sky world were linked in
    3184

    this Mystery, sharing many of the same Gods and Goddesses. The daily
    rebirth of the Sun and the phases of the Moon are a good instance of
    this link between the World above and the one below.
     
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Earth World, occupied by we the living, also
    contains reflections and influences of the Sky World and the Underworld.
    These influences can be pictured as three zones (remember three is a
    sacred number): the upper zone is associated with the weather, the
    flight of birds, sky augeries and the elements and powers of Air, the
    middle zone is further divided into the Four Directions or Quarters
    (each with it's own Powers/Guardians of the Sacred Land), and the lower
    zone containing the depths of the sea, caves, cairns, burial mounds,
    "hollow hills" and sacred springs. This zone is the home of the Sidhe
    and the spirits associated with the Portals to the Underworld itself.
    The Celts in their life upon the Sacred Land expected to experience the
    influences of the Sky and Underworld in their life upon the Land. This
    attitude is demonstrated in the many dindsenchahs (stories of place
    names) that are told in Ireland to this day. Many of these stories are
    associated with a deity, an elemental, an Underworld portal or a combat
    of the God/desses and/or Epic heroes and heroines.

    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) The following is a listing of the major Irish Gods and 
                    Goddesses:

                    Goddesses:

                            Pwyll, Pryderi, Kicva
     
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) These two groups seem to relate to one another but
    sometimes the correspondences can get very confusing. I include the
    deities that most closely resonate with my own Inner Being when working
    with the Sky World and the Underworld. My pantheon of Gods and Goddesses
    is both Welsh and Irish (as am I <G>). I include a more detailed
    description of them here:
     
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Danu
                            The Red Mother of All,
                            Major Mother Goddess of Ireland,
                            Mother of the Gods and Patroness of
                            wizards, rivers, water, wells, prosperity
                            and plenty, Magick and wisdom.
    3185
     
                    Dagdha
                            The All Father,
                            Eochaid Ollathair ( Father of All),
                            Ruadh Rofessa (The Red One, Lord of
                            Occult Knowledge),
                            Dagdha (the Good God)
                            Many talented and powerful,
                            Master of the harp and possessor
                            of a dread double ended club.
                            The Chief of the Tuatha de Dannan.
     
                    The Goddess of Sovereignty (Banbha, Fodla, Eriu)
                            The Land and the King were wed through
                            many ceremonies. Essentually the fate of the
                            King and the fate of the land were One and
                            vice versa. The Favor of the Goddess could
                            be granted by some heroic act or bu being
                            Magickally chosen (The Lia Fail could do
                            this, more later). Women who held the 
                            Sovereignty of the land were often referred
                            to as the Goddess (Such as Medb, Boudicca
                            and Macha-Red Mane).
                    Nuada
                            The King and battle leader 
                            of the Tuatha de Dannan,
                            Possessor of the Magick Sword of Findias,
                            Lost his sword hand in the First Battle of
                            Moytura, against the Fir Bolgs,
                            stepped down from the Kingship
                            (because the King could nave no blemish)
                            even though he was outfitted with a 
                            Magickal hand of silver. He eventually
                            had his hand Magickally restored to lead
                            the Tuatha de Dannans  against the Fomors
                            in the second Battle of Moy Tura. In this
                            battle he was physically killed so he 
                            returned the Lands of the Sidhe.
                    Brigid
                            Breo saighead (Fiery Arrow or Power)
                            Often called the Triple Brigid or the

                            hearth, martial arts, healing and
                            inspiration. The White Maiden aspect of 
                            the Triple Goddess. Her Feast is the
                            Major Celtic Festival of Imbolc. She 
                            who gives hope and new beginnings. The
                            Celtic Church could not replace her, so
                            they absorbed her as the "foster-mother"
                            of Christ and as St. Brigit, the daughter
                            of the Druid Dougal the Brown. Brigid is
                            very like the Greek Goddess Athena.
                    Lugh
                            Sam ildanach (many skilled). This is the
                            Celtic Mercury. The grandson of Balor 
                            (leader of the Fomorians and the son of
    3186

                            Cian and Ethniu, a Sidhe princess. His 
                            feast is Lughnasadh, a celebration of
                            the death of his "foster mother", Tailtiu.
                            He is the combination of the Tuatha de
                            Dannans and the Fomors. He replaces Nuada
                            as the King and battle leader of the Tuatha
                            de Dannan and leads them to ultimate victory
                            in the second Battle of Moytura. He is 
                            sometimes called the "Shining One" and/or
                            Lugh Lamhfada (of the "long arm"). 
                            He also has attributes of a carpenter, mason,
                            poet,Druid, physician and a goldsmith. He
                            can be considered the Irish God of just about
                            everything. He was also the father of the
                            great Irish hero, Cuchulain.

                            antics, he was an extremely powerful God 
                            and was usually associated with fertility,
                            rebirth, weather, sailing and Magick. He also
                            had a Magickal ship that moved without sails

                    the Welsh, whose poetry and songs, Including the       
                     Cad Goddieu, tell us most of what we know about       
                     Druidry in Wales. He gained his knowledge from        
                    the Cauldron of Cerridwen. They are both patrons

                           The "Sun Faced" One, so called because he was a

    2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Objects of Power"
     
    The Tuatha de Dannans are the Children of the Mother Goddess Danu. They
    are the Gods and Goddesses of Ireland. Some say they come from the sky,
    others say the North. They were masters of Occult knowledge learned in
    the four great Magickal cities of Findias, Gorias, Murias and Falias.
    They were given a great treasure by the Chief Mages of each city
    (Uiscias from Findias, Esras from Gorias, Semias from Murias and
    Morfessa from Falias). These gifts are the four treasures of Ireland:
    The Sword of Nuada, the Spear of Lugh, the Cauldron of Rebirth and the
    Stone of Fal. We can use the Power of such gifts in our own Magick by
    invoking the four Masters of the North.  Once invoked, the Power of 
    3188

    their gifts can once again be manifested in our very own Magickal
    Talismans.
     
     
    2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Sword Of Nuada Argetla'm"
     
    The first object of Power comes from Findias. It is the invincible sword
    of Nuada "of the silver hand".  It represents the forces of insight and
    illumination.  It is a representation of the terrible Powers of creative
    energy. The drawing of such a sword is what gives us new and terrible
    abilities (Atomic Power is an example of what such inspiration can
    create). The wisdom to not use or to maintain control such powers is
    what the use of this Sword is all about. Many times the wisest course of
    action is to keep the Sword sheathed and to resolve our conflicts
    peacefully.

    Here is a description of this Magickal weapon's use in a modern day
    ritual:
                   <I walk to the altar and pick up the Sword.  Advancing to the
    East, I raise the Sword and say:>  "Here is the Sword of Nuada Argetla'm
    in its deady scabbard.
                            Heed the Magicks of Findias! 
                            Uiscias wrought this blade! 
                            He of the Silver Hand lives again!
                            Who will dare to grasp it and define 
                            the boundaries of our safety?"
            
                   <After the sword has been accepted by a member of the Circle,
                   the following is said while walking three times (deosil)
                   around the perimeter of the Circle :>
     
                            "Come forth Old One of the East!!!"
            
              <After the completion of the three circles, I light the Red
    Candle of Life that sits upon the Eastern Quarter and say:>
     
                            "Guard us well so that our lives may be our own.
                            Dia is Bandia linn!
                            (So Mote It Be!)"
     
    2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Spear of Lugh Lamhfadha"
     
    The second object of Power comes from Findias. It is the iresistible
    Spear of Lugh "of the Long Arm".  This gift represents the ability to
    act across a distance.  It is represented by the Powers of fire that can
    also act across a distance, leaping between burning buildings yet also
    warming us from within the hearth fires. This flaming spear always finds
    its target once thrown. It is no surprise that Lugh must defeat Balor
    "of the Evil Eye" allowing the Tuatha de Dannans to conquer the Fomor.
    Today the ability to act across a distance might be better characterised
    by the telephone/communications networks.  The free exchange of
    information has fanned the flames of creativity in the modern world.
     
    2-6,O'Dubhain ) Here is a description of this Magickal weapon's use in
    the same modern day ritual as before:
                     
                            <I walk to the altar and pick up the Spear.
    Advancing to the South, I raise the Spear and say:>
    3189
     
                   "In my Right hand I hold the Spear of Lugh Lamhfadha.
              Brought from Gorias and given by Esras.
              It contains the Wisdom of Many acting across the Ways.
              No batle can be sustained against us while we possess it.
              Who will wield this Power?"
     
    2-6,O'Dubhain ) <After the spear has been accepted by a member of the
    Circle, the following is said while walking three times (deosil) around
    the perimeter of the Circle :>
     
                            "Come forth Old One of the South!!!"
            
    <After the completion of the three circles, I light the White Candle of
    Inspiration that is in the South and say:>
     
                            "Guard us well so that our ideas may burn
                            as does Thy eternal flame.
                            Dia is Bandia linn!
                            (So Mote It Be!)"
     
    2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Cauldron of Rebirth"
     
    The third object of Power comes from Murias. It is the "Cauldron of
    Rebirth". This gift has the  Power to regenerate life and is usually
    associated with the Dagdha or Bran the Blessed. It can also be linked
    with portals to the Otherworld through which all life  passes during the
    death/life cycle. Mannanan mac Llyr who rules the sea and who is the
    possessor of the "Crane Bag" (another symbol for the Cauldron) is
    another deity associated with this Magickal device. The Welsh Goddess
    Cerridwen is also a keeper of the Sacred Cauldron.The Spring of Life and
    wisdom flows forth from the depths of the sea (another use for this
    cauldron).
      
    2-6,O'Dubhain ) Here is a description of this Magickal device's use in
    our modern day rituals:
     
                            <I walk to the altar and pick up the Cauldron. 
    I place it upon the West Quarter and say:>
     
                            "This is the Cauldron of Rebirth, 
                            by it's waters we are reborn.
                            Fashioned in the fires of Murias,
                            Forged by the will of Samias.
                            Life eternal is its gift.
                            We pass through Death with each use.
                            May the waters of rebirth ever flow forth!
                            Who will call us back 
                            from the deepest meditation?
                            Who will summon us from the Shadows
                            of the Sea?"
     
                            <The Cauldron has sea salted water poured into
    it by a member of the Circle, This water is sprinkled three times
    (deosil) around the perimeter of the Circle while the following is
    said:>
     
                            "Make thy Presence known Old One of the West!"
            
    3190

    <After the completion of the three circles, I light the Gray Candle of
    Twilight that stands in the West and say:>
     
                            "Keep our Spirits safe within Your soft embrace.
                            Dia is Bandia linn!
                            So Mote It Be!"
     
    2-6,O'Dubhain )         "The Lia Fail"
    This is the Kingship stone of Ireland. It was brought from the Northern
    city of Fal by the Tuatha de Dannan. This stone represents the Land and
    it's Sovereignty. It also represents the Power of the Earth to Judge all
    men. The other portals to the Underworld (caves and raths) are represen-
    ted by this Magickal object.  The dark reaches of the Underworld hide
    the secret knowledge of Death and Life. It is into the earth that Celts
    are buried to begin their journeys after death. Small wonder it is that
    the Goddess guarding this object should be the dread Morrighan. She
    represents the Wisdom that is gained via the Dark Pathways, yet she is
    also the bringer of victory in battle as well as new life, where none
    was expected. She represents the stark reality of Life and Death.
     
    2-6,O'Dubhain ) Here is a description of this Magickal device's use in
    our modern day rituals:
     
    <I walk to the altar and pick up the Stone.  I place it in front of the
    North Quarter candle and say:>
     
         "This is the Lia Fail, let all here be sobered by its True  Judgement. This is the Stone of Judgement, Solemn sacred One of Falias,
    grant our space your Sovereignty.  Morfesa has worked the   Earth's
    Power within you.  Judge of Kings, Center of Earth, Speak   and we shall
    listen!  Do not let us fail to heed your warnings!"
            
    <I turn to face the members of the Circle and ask:>
            
                            "Who will Stand with the Stone of Destiny?"
     
    <The One that has accepted the challenge, steps upon the stone and crys
    forth:>
            
                            "Manifest your Power Old One of the North!"
                            "Open Your Dark Pathways
                            Give us True Judgement!
                            Bring forth Thy Hidden Knowledge!"
     
    <I step back to the altar and face to the North.  I light the Black
    Candle of Darkness and say to all those who are gathered:>
     
                            "May our souls know the Truth of Eternity.
                            Dia is Bandia linn!
                            So Mote it Be!"
            
    <Starting at the East with arms open, I turn deosil around the Circle,
    stopping when I have come back to the East and say:>
     
         "My Brothers and Sisters in the One Power, Hear my Words!  Our
    Circle is complete!  We have Perfectly Created a Sacred Space, a Place
    out of Time. Let none seek to enter who would violate our Purpose. Our
    will shall be done and none shall be harmed! May the Guardians of the
    3191

    Four Quarters keep Their Watch over this Circle and lend us Their Mighty
    Aid!"
     
     
    2-6,O'Dubhain )  That pretty much sums up the prepared presentation, any
    questions?


    (2-5,Nan)        Whew!
    (2-5,Nan)        I'm still absorbing
    (2-2,Freepowder) bet your fingers are cramped <G>
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) yep!  Well there is a lot more I could say!<G>
    (2-2,Freepowder) ok!
    (2-2,Freepowder) <hehehehe>
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Like We could talk about just where those cities were?
                     The Sky or the North?
                     UFO's maybe?
    (2-2,Freepowder) ok, first tho, was the stone of fal...
    (2-2,Freepowder) the same as the stone of scone?
    (2-2,Freepowder) ga
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) That was what the Scots and the Sassanach would have us
    believe.
    (2-2,Freepowder) you say?
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) But the Irish tradition is that it is still inside of
    Tara.
    (2-2,Freepowder) thought so. hrumph.
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Why would we every give away one of the treasures of
    the Land?
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Besides!<G>
    (2-2,Freepowder) stolen?
    (2-5,Nan)        what's the stone of scone? (other than a very old tea
    snack <g>)
    (2-2,Freepowder) LOL
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) If it really was stolen then it sits in Westminister
    Abbey!  And hasn't cried out in over 400 years!<G>
    (2-2,Freepowder) nahm, it's still in Tara, yup!
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Meaning.....that the Sassanach are not the rightful
    kings of Ireland!!!!<GGGG>
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) The stone of Scone was the kingship stone of the Scots
    (2-5,Nan)        ahh, now i remember
    (2-2,Freepowder) N> Scotland had a similar legend to that of the stone 
                     of Fal, it was taken to westminister abbey when the 
                     english took scotland
    (2-2,Freepowder) And they niver give it back!
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Fp>That's right....thieving Sassanch!<G>
    (2-2,Freepowder) rude!
    (2-5,Nan) lol
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) <======Just finished "Trinity" and in a very 
                     unforgiving mood.
    (2-2,Freepowder) the 4 cities, which world were they in?
    (2-2,Freepowder) LOL!
    (2-2,Freepowder) grand book! read it a few years ago.
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Yes it sure makes one think that they'll never resolve 
                    the Problem of Northern Ireland.
    (2-2,Freepowder) I met a fellow, prob IRA, said...
    (2-2,Freepowder) the brits need to just pull out...
    (2-2,Freepowder) I said ther'd be a blood bath....
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Fp>The Four Cities were in the North but in the       
    3192

              Spirtual Plane.
    (2-2,Freepowder) he said for a few years then it would come right.
    (2-2,Freepowder) sky or earth or underworld?
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Fp>Sky types always associated with the Spirit and Big 
                     Magick. But of course two of the gifts were associated 
                     with the Underworld. The Stone and the Cauldron.
    (2-2,Freepowder) sounds like a commercial, 'Big,Big Magick!' <G>
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Goes back to that dual nature of the Deities again. 
    John Matthews has a great picture in his book, "Celtic Shamanism" of a
    World Tree that has roots in the Underworld and branches into the Sky
    World.  The two are connected by a Rainbow of colors , stars and 
    Totem animals!
    (2-2,Freepowder) you have more books than I have money <G> 
                     >sounds like Yggdrisll
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Rainbow "brige" exists outside of the Physical
    World entirely.
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Yes it does sound like Yggdrisll!  I have a GIF of this
    Cosmology at home and will upload it to Library 16 this weekend.
    (2-2,Freepowder) now, where have I heard of the rainbow bridge....Jesse 
                     Jackson? <G>
    (2-5,Nan)        well, i should be on my way.....thanks for another
    great workshop O'D. Looking forward to more :)
    (2-2,Freepowder) cool!

                     transcripts?
    (2-2,Freepowder) the rest of the stuff at the top of this.<G>
    (2-2,Freepowder) yeah, it might help if the right rom was listed in
    notices
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Oscar night is a tough night to compete with the
    Tube!:(  I did mention that to the Sysops, but I guess they have their
    hands full.
    (2-2,Freepowder) as long as they are reading..'sok
    (2-2,Freepowder) hey! I volunteered to get into sysopery <G>
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) <======would like to get some additional opinions 
                     on some of this stuff.
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) FP>You did? Great!
                     What was the response?
                     This workshop is closed! BTW!<G>
    (2-2,Freepowder) well, maybe if you are in the right place at the right
    time bla bla...
    (2-2,Freepowder) I figured that out
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) LOL!
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) <======just wanted it in the transcript!<G>

    <We next engaged in some generalized Celtic discussion that I thought
    would be of interest to the offline class readers!<G> ...>

    (2-13,DRUID)     I am working on my Ovate Initiation at this time.

    (2-13,DRUID)     Fellowship of Isis. Olivia Robertson
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Dia dhuit, a DhRUID!
    (2-2,Freepowder) there is one referenct to lugh using a rock I think <G>
    (2-13,DRUID)     as far as books, i have quite a few, would
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) The FOI sounds Thelemic to me.
    (2-13,DRUID)     not know what to recomend.
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) I read the Book of Druidry by Ross Nichols
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) Found it to be based upon the works of Davies and
    Morganwig.
    (2-13,DRUID)     I saw that you were giving a workshop on Ogham.
    (2-13,DRUID)     I have seen some of the origional standing Ogham stones 
                    in northern England.
    (2-13,DRUID)     They are standing in remote fields, not even marked
    very well.
    (2-2,Freepowder) Must be nice to live on the ground so to speak ,less
    the economy, tho <G>
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) DRUID>It's my belief that the Oghams carved upon sticks 
                    have long since disintergrated.
    (2-13,DRUID)     They are weather beaten, but you can still make them
    out.
    (2-6,O'Dubhain ) BTW They did find some Standing stones in this country 
                     with Oghams upon them!<G>

              "Celtic Workshop #6 - Dindsenchas, Totems and Transmigration"

    This is a transcript of the sixth Celtic Workshop - Dindsenchas,Totems
    and Transmigration. The purpose of this Workshop was to investigate the
    Celtic Inner Spirit by looking at beliefs about the Land, the Family,
    the Spirit and the Soul. The stories about name origins as well as the
    practice of having totemic beasts seemed to be a good place to start. I
    also hoped that such investigations would give added meaning to
    understanding Druidic concepts of Being.

    3197

    Before I begin let me say a few words about how the Workshop is con-
    ducted.  We will first hear from a presenter, tonight that is me. If you
    have a question type in a ? and I will acknowledge you by typing "ga" at
    and appropriate time.  When you have finished your question type "ga" to
    let me know that I may respond. When    we are finished I will ack-
    nowledge the next questioner in a similar manner. If you have a comment
    or additional information to provide on a topic, please use the "!" to
    signal me.  I will also cycle through those with comments in a similar
    manner. If their are no questions at this point I will begin tonight's
    presentation.
     
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   The Subject of tonight's Celtic Workshop
                   is:
                                   Dindsenchas, Totemic Animals and 
                                   Transmigration of the Soul.
                    
    During the previous Workshop, we studied the Celtic Otherworld and their
    God/desses. We saw how Existence was divided into a Higher, Middle and
    Underworld reality. The Spirit of the Celt would be tied to and migrate
    between these various worlds. A celt was very connected to the land as
    well as having a strong belief in his "code of conduct'" and the
    immortality of his Being. Tonight's Workshop will attempt to clarify how
    A Celt arrived at these strong inner concepts of connection to his
    family, his Land and his Eternal or Spirit life. In order to understand
    the Celtic Spirit, one must know the Dinseanchas, the Totemic Animals
    and the Druidic concept of Transmigration of the Soul.
     
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   The first topic to be covered will be the Dinseanchas.
     
    ................................................................................
    3198

                   Dinseanchas or "Place Name Stories"
     
    The Dinseanchas or "Place Name Stories" are among the earliest tales of
    Ireland. This tract gives the etymology of the names of several of the
    more well known places of Erinn. The first such "place name" that we
    will discuss is the origin of the Names "Meath" and "Uisnech". These two
    locations are tied into the history of the Kings of Ireland. Meath is
    the "fifth" division of Ireland set aside for the Ard Reis to rule and 
    Uisnech is the hill that represents the Spiritual center of Ireland. 

    (2-21,O'Dubh)   This is the story of Uisnech:
     
    "After the Tuatha de Dannans had been conquered by the Sons of Milesius
    (Mileseans), Midhe the son of Brath, son of Detha, was the first to
    light a fire in all of Erinn. This fire burned upon his hilltop for
    seven years and all the fires of the land were lighted using this fire.
    Midhe and his clan were entitled to a sack of corn and a pig from every
    house in Erinn each year in return for maintaining this fire. Naturally
    the Druids were envious of this fact and they met together to conspire
    against Midhe and his clan. Midhe discovered the plot and attacked the
    Druid conclave, cutting out the tongues of the Druids so they could not
    speak against him. He buried these tongues in the earth and sat upon the
    spot while his mother exclaimed that it was "proudly" or "Uaisnech" you
    sit up there this night! This then is the derivation of the name of the
    hill, Uisnech and of the province of Meath "Midhe". BTW Uisnech is
    pronounced "ISH nuk".
     
    Uisnech is the site also of the "Well of Life" where twelve major
    Magickal rivers flow forth from the Underworld. Could this be the Magick
    of the Druids tongues?
    (2-10,Adam)     ?
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   Yes Adam? ga
    (2-8,O'Ba'n)    !
    (2-8,O'Ba'n)    I've never heard this story
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   Ok O'Ba'n a question?
    (2-8,O'Ba'n)    GA
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   This story is from the ancient Irish Writings.           You can find it in "A Celtic Reader" by John Matthews  It's source is
    from Eugene O'Curry
    (2-8,O'Ba'n) GA
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   ok
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   Here is a story of the origins of the name "Tara":
     
    "Another significant hill is Tara. This hill had it's name changed five
    times. It was first called Druim Descuin or "the Conspicuous Hill", next
    it was Liath Druim after a Firbolg chieftain who was first to clear it
    of woods. The third name for the hill was Druim Cain  "the Beautiful
    Hill", then Cathar Crofinn, and finally Teamair (Anglicized Tara) from
    the name Te'a the wife of Eremon the son of Milesius."
     
    This story gives us a mini history of Ireland, from the original names
    of the hill through the names ascribed to various invading tribes until
    we see the name that it retains to this day "Tara". BTW this name is
    pronounced "CHOW irr" in Gaeilge.
     
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   Another Dindseanchas is the story of Lughaidh Delbaeth
    "the fire-producer", a Dalcasian Druid.  "Lugaid had a considerable
    amount of land, while the husband of his daughter, Trad, though a king,
    3199

    had little land and a large family. Trad asked Lugaid for an oracle to
    find out how he could gain more land. Lugaid consulted his oracles and
    announced that if Trad would ask any man on that day to surrender his
    lands, that man would be bound to comply. Trad then asked Lugaid to
    surrender his lands which he did. Lugaid took his six sons with him
    across the Shannon river where he started a fire by means of his Druid 
    Power. This fire had five streams issuing from it.  Each of the eldest
    five sons followed these flames to the site of their new lands. Lugaid
    remained behind with his youngest son, Nos, and eventually dies and was
    buried next to a lake, near to Carn Fiacha (now called Loch Lugh-phorta
    or the Lake of Lugaid)."
     
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   This story is important for a few reasons: 
     
                                   1. It is an instance of the use of Druid Magick to
    create fire.
     
                                   2. It shows the the use of oracles to determine a course
    of action.
     
                                   3. It demonstrates the sanctity of one's word of honor.
     
                                   4. It shows the derivation of several place names as
    well as the family name of "Devlin" (from Dealbhna, derived from
    Debaeth).
     
    A story of this sort was used to establish place names, to derive family
    traditions, to demonstrate morality, to show the worth of cunning and
    integrity. It is also a good example of Druidic Powers. it was from a
    large wealth and variety of such tales that our ancestors remembered
    their past and learned their code of living.
     
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   This serves a similar function to the new book by
    William Bennett.....can't recall the title.  But I think it's on the
    best seller list right now....anyone know the book?  Something like the
    Book of......?
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   O'Ba'n ?  ah well continuing onward!<G>
    (2-8,O'Ba'n)    dunno <G>
    (2-4,Nan)       the book of o'ban????!!!! <vbg>
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   I'll find the name and insert it!  Nan!!!!LOL!
    (2-8,O'Ba'n)    great writer ain't I?
    (2-10,Adam)     <g>
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   The next topic to be discussed will be the Totemic
    Animals.
     
                "Celtic Totem Animals"
     
    Celts and Druids held the belief that each person and family had a
    special relationship with animals and animal Spirit Beings that were
    sacred to ech clan.  This belief is what Patricia Kennealy is referring
    to in her book "Strange Days, My Life With Jim Morrison". MS. Kennealy
    is a member of an ancient clan of Irish "Wolf Shamans" whose tradition
    states that they are the Magickal leaders of their people.  This
    association of Spirit Animals or "Totems" is based upon the ancient
    Celtic belief that all life is related, the Land, the waters, the
    spirits of a place, the trees, the flora and the animals that they lived
    with side by side. Many ancient stories tell how the Druids could
    "shapeshift" into animal form to escape or work Magick. To know your
    3200

    Inner Celtic Spirit, you must know your clan and your personal Spirit
    Animal.
     
    (2-25,Denise H) I am here at last :)
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   The following animals appear throughout Celtic tales
    and Magick:
     
                   The Salmon (Brionnfhionn)
     
    This is the fish of All Wisdom. It lives in the depths of the Sea from
    which all life springs. It is said to acquire it's great knowledge from 
    eating the Nine Hazels of Wisdom that fall from the Tree of Knowledge.
    This fish was said to be among the oldest of living creatures. The great
    Hero and Druid Fionn mac Cumhail gained his wisdom by touching his thumb
    to a salmon that he was cooking for the Druid Fintan.
                    
                   The Deer or Stag (Abhach, Sailetheach)
     
    The deer was said to be a fairy creature that could pass between the
    world's. This was especially true for a white deer. Fionn's wife Sabha
    became a deer when she went to the Otherworld. Beautiful women frequen-
    tly became deer in many tales while fleeing from hunters. The Druid Tuan
    mac Carill is the sole survivor of a group of early Partholanian Irish
    settlers. He lives at first as a wildman of the woods eventually
    becoming a stag, an eagle, a salmon and eventually is reincarnated as
    himself at a much later date to give the ancient history of Ireland to
    the more recent settlers.
     
                   The Horse (Cab-all)
     
    The horse  was one of the most important animals to  the Celts. A mare
    is ritually symbolically mated by the King in the Rite of Sovereignty.
    White horses are also mystical beings. It is a pale horse that is ridden
    by Gwynn ap Nudd the Master of the Wild Hunt in Wales while gathering
    souls. A huge horse shape is sculpted into the hills of Wiltshire called
    White Horse Hill. This animal is another guide to the Otherworld.
     
                   The Hawk (Seg or Aracos)

    The most famous Hawk is the Hawk of Achill that can riddle and discuss
    with the  Druidic poet Fintan. This animal is also as old as time and
    another storehouse of great knowledge.
     
                   The Blackbird (Druid-dhubh)
     
    This is yet another animal that can freely pass into the Otherworld. It
    is associated with the Druids and the Goddess Rhiannon. This bird has
    mystical arts and can sing one into a trancelike state. It can give one
    access to the Magick of the Otherworld  and is an excellent familiar.
    This is not the Crow or Raven but a songbird.
     
                   The Hound/the Dog (Abach)
     
    This is an animal of the hunt and is frequently associated with
    humanlike intelligence. The hounds of Fionn mac Cumhail, Bran and
    Sgeolainn, are actually transformed humans, The Cwn Annwn, are the
    Gabriel hounds that accompany Gwynn ap Nudd during the Wild Hunt as well
    as guarding the gates to the Underworld or Annwn the kingdom of the God
    3201

    of the Dead, Arawn. Cuchulain the Champion of Ulster gets his name from
    replacing the Hound of Cuchul that he kills. He is called the "Hound
    of Ulster" from this event. The hound is also his totem animal.
     
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   <a slight pause>

    There are many other Magickal totemic animals in Celtic Magick and
    history: the Eagle (Iolair), Crow (Badb), Raven (Bran), Sow (Airc), Boar
    (Bacrie), Cat (Caoit), Otter (Balgair), Bear (Arth), Badger (Breach) and
    the Eel (As-chu).
     
    The Dragon is another mighty Magical animal that appears in British and
    Welsh stories. It is, of course, a creature of fire but is also related
    to the Power of the Land. Another word for Ley Lines is Dragon Lines.
    Another name for raising Power is to invoke the "Eye of the Dragon". The
    whole Earth was viewed by the Druids as the body of the Dragon. Menhirs
    and stone Circles were located at great Power nodes. The Celts called
    Dragons "Fire Drakes".
     
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   The importance of these animals is in their use as
    Spirit Guides in the Otherworld and their aid as a familiar in working
    Magick. To find your totemic animal will require you to experience a
    shamanistivc trance. This is usually accomplished by "drumming" and
    meditation. (You'll need someone to drum or a "drumming tape" to allow
    yourself a chance to really meditate). Open youself up to the God of the
    Hunt as you meditate upon the Tree of Life. He will come to you while
    you are in trance (usually after 10 to 40 minutes of drumming). Your
    totem animal will apear running from the Great Forest. When the animal
    appears, let its essence fill you. Become your totem. Dance its dance
    and sing its song until you are one in the Spirit. You should repeat
    this ritual as often as necessary to have a close rapport with your
    Spirit Animal guide.  Much of what you are told and given will be from
    the perspective of the Animal and will be difficult to understand unless
    you are truly One with it.  

    (2-4,Nan)       does one usually only have a single totem animal or is 
    it possible to have more than one? ga
    (2-21,O'Dubh)   It's possible to have more than one.  You might have a
    clan totem as well as a personal totem animal.

    (2-21,O'Dubh)   Ok I have one more topic to cover  "The Transmigration
    of the Soul"
     
    I would like to start this discussion by quoting an ancient Celtic
    Culdean verse:
     
                                  "Out of a Timeless World
                                  Shadows fall upon time.
                                  From a beauty older than earth
                                  A ladder the soul may climb.
                                  I climb by Fionn's Stair
                                  To a whiteness older than time."
                    
    The above verse is referring to Aradach Fionn, a listing of the Oghams.
    Each rung of the ladder or stair represents a lesson learned or a new
    life of continuing perfection. Such a series of lessons and rebirths are
    a manifestation of the Druidic concept of the Tramsmigration of the
    Soul.
    3202                            
                   A few quotes about Druids:
     
    "The principal point of their teaching is that the soul does not perish,
    and that after death it passes from one body into another." .....Julius
    Caesar.
     
    "Among them the doctrine of Pythagoras prevails, according to which the
    souls of men are immortal, and after a fixed term recommence to live,
    taking upon themselves a new body."....Diodorus
     
    According to some sources, this transmigration of the soul was done in
    an upward fashion, with each incarnation bringing the Being closer to
    the True Spirit. According to others, we are reincarnated into future
    lives of our progeny...thus Mongan is The Spirit of Fionn reincarnated
    in the Seventh Century CE (Fionn himself was said to be Cumhail reincar-
    nated). As we have seen previously, the Spirit of Tuan mac Carill is
    reincarnated several times as a variety of animals until he is reborn
    in the sixth century and relates his history of Ireland from the time of
    Partholan forward, St. Finnen is the Irish monk to whom the story was
    related. This story was eventually recorded in the Eleventh century
    manuscript, "The Book of the Dun Cow". No record exists to indicate that
    the Druids believed in "karma", duality (as seen in the concept of "good
    and evil"), original sin (actually they believed man was inheritly
    good), nor a heaven and hell afterlife.
     
    Where did one's soul reside then ? Many stories were told and written of
    the Otherworlds that awaited the Spirit between incarnations, These 
    stories are called immrama or "wonder voyages" and usually involve
    taking ship to a Magickal Isle. The voyages of Bran and St. Brendan 
    generally fit into these catagories.
                    
    When one arrives at an Otherworldly island, time can pass extremely
    slowly compared to the Physical world. Oisin the son of Fionn went to
    such a faery world for a few days only. When he returned for a visit
    upon one of those Magickal White Horses, he discovered that many
    hundreds of years had passsed.  Although he had been cautioned not to
    dismount during his visit, he did so and was immediately transformed
    into an extremely elderly man. St. Patrick was brought to him and heard
    his many stories of the exploits of Fionn and the Fianna as well as the 
    lands of Tir na Og. Oisin was eventualy rescued by his Sidhe princess
    and returned to the Land of Eternal Youth. Some of the other Lands are
    called:
     
                                  Tir fo Thuinn - Land under the Wave.
                                  Tir na mBan   - Land of Women.
                                  Tir na mBeo   - Land of Life.
     
    These four Tirs or lands make up the Celtic Underworld where Souls
    reside until reborn. There are also Plains above that are generally the
    habitations of the Gods.
                   Thes are:
                                  Sen Magh      - Old Plain
                                  Magh Argetal  - Plain of Silver Clouds
                                  Magh Mell     - Plain of Delight
                        Magh Ionganaidh - Plain of Wonder




    3203

    The Irish Celts felt that the Being had the following attributes or
    divisions:

                                  Delph         - The appearance or Outer form
                                  Duile         - The Body Elements 
                                                                               (flesh, bone, blood, etc)
                                  Ana'l         - The breath or anima
                                  Menma         - The Mind and the Will
                                  Cuimhne       - The Memory
                                  Fein          - The Self
                                  Pu'ca         - The shape-shifting Shadow
                                  Enaid         - The Soul.
     
    I would like to finish my remarks on Reincarnation and Transmigration
    with another ancient verse. This verse is from the Fifth Century CE and
    is the translation by Kuno Meyer:
     
                                  "I invoke the seven daughters of the sea
                                  Who fashion the threads of the sons of 
                                  long life.
                                  May three deaths be taken from me!
                                  May seven waves of good fortune be dealt to me!
                                  May no evil spirits harm me on my circuit!
                                  In flashing corslet without hindrance!
                                  May my fame not perish!
                                  May old age come to me, may death not come 
                                  to me until I am old!"
     
                                  "I invoke Senach of the seven periods of time,
                                  Whom fairy women have reared on the breasts 
                                  of plenty.
                                  May my seven candles not be extinguished!
                                  I am an indestructable stronghold.
                                  I am an unshaken rock.
                                  I am a precious stone.
                                  I am the luck of the week.
                                  May I live a hundred times a hundred years.
                                  Each hundred of them apart!
                                  I summon their boons to me.
                                  May the grace of the Holy Spirit be upon me!"
     
    That's the Celtic view of life!  To live but to have variety and
    passion, while reincarnating over and over!<G>

                              Celtic Workshop #7 

       "In Between Times and Places", "Need Fires" or Days of Imbalance,
              Portals, Dolmens, Passage Graves and Stone Circles"

    Tonight the Magickal nature of "In Between Times and Places" will be
    discussed and examples will be given for their use in Magickal "wor-
    kings". The Druidic concept of "imbalance" in Magickal workings will be
    introduced and discussed. The nature and use of the stone megalithic
    sites will also be presented and discussed.

    Tonight we undertake a journey to the lands that are between the worlds.
    This is the same place where anything can happen that Rod Serling
    referred to as the "Twilight Zone". The ancient Celts sought out this
    3204

    Magickal place to aid their Magickal Power and to seek the Otherworld.
    Before we can undertake this journey of the Spirit as well as the Mind,
    a brief review and synopsis of our previous discussions on the Celtic
    Otherworld and Magick are in order. 

                         "In Between Times and Places"

    As we noted previously, the Celts believed that Reality actually
    consisted of multiple worlds.  As a minimum, they believed there was a
    World of the Stars or Gods, a Middle World (the Earth) and an Under-
    world. All these worlds were connected in some way, with events and
    Magicks from one affecting events occuring in a different world.
    The Celts believed that these Worlds were closer at certain times. These
    are the "In Between Times" that we are going to speak about tonight. It
    should also be no surprise that the Celts and Druids practiced their
    most important Magicks during such times of transition as the sunrise,
    sunset,the moonrise, moonset and the transitions of the seasons
    (Beltaine and Samhain) and the extremes of the Sun (Mid-Winter and
    Mid-Summer) or the great "Fire Festivals". Later during our discussions
    of stone circles and passage graves we shall see one way that this
    desire to do Magick at the optimal times was possibly implemented.

                     "The Magickal Laws of Druidic Power"

    Celtic tales of Magick are filled with events that are linked to "in
    between states". This could be a mysterious fog, a time of dusk or next
    to the edge of water. All of these conditions have one state in common,
    they represent imbalance. Any student of the physical sciences can tell
    you, that all forces can  be resolved into the sum total of the in-
    dividual forces. One of the factors that must be overcome when moving
    anything is inertia. During times of change, when imbalance occurs
    naturally, is the time chosen by Druids for their Magicks. This is and
    example of the Law of Magickal Association, the Law of Similarity and
    the Law of Contagion as stated by Issac Bonewits in his book "Real
    Magick". Here is a listing of those three laws of Magick:

             Law of Association.

    If two things have anything in common that thing can be used to control
    both, and they have a mutual influence on each other, depending on the
    size of the thing shared. The more they have in common, the more they
    influence each other.

             Law of Similarity.

    This is the basis of "Sympathetic" magic and basically says that effects
    resembles causes.  "Lookalikes are alike".

             Law of Contagion.

    It states that once things come into contact, they continue to interact
    after separation.  "Power is contagious".

    These three Laws of Magick basically say that if you want to do Magick
    pick a time when Magick occurs that is similar to the kind of Magick
    that you want to accomplish. There is a very similar belief held by
    modern Wiccans.  Wiccans normally do creative or "positive" magick when
    the Moon is in its waxing phases. Banishing or "dark" Magick is done
    3205

    during the waning phases of the Moon. Druidic Magick took advantage of
    the times when the Sun or Moon "touched" the Earth (Sun/Moon rise/set).
    At such a time, some of the Power inherit to these heavenly deities
    could be "borrowed". This is the Law of Contagion at work. At Sunrise
    and Sunset is when the mists "Magickally" appear, making fog or mists a
    time of Magickal workings. The area of transition between states of
    matter such as the edge of a river or lake was also thought to be a
    Magickal location. This could have been due to the belief that all
    knowledge flowed forth from  the Well of Segais or Conla's Well but I
    believe it is more closely associated with the belief that where
    different worlds met was also a place where entry to the Otherworld was
    the easiest.  This also explains why they favored divination by the edge
    of water. Fire scrying is another example of this "Magick" in transition
    states. Fire is the ultimate transitory state of matter and leads us to
    the next  topic of discussion, "Need Fires" and "Days of Imbalance".

                              "Days of Imbalance"

    As you will recall, another time of greatest imbalance was when the
    change of the seasons and the extremes of the Sun. This is, of course,
    Beltaine, Samhain, Mid-Winter's and Mid-Summer's Solstices. Great fires
    were kindled during these festivals for two reasons: To encourage and
    enhance the energies of the Sun and to create conditions favorable to
    Tramsmutation of Power.

    These "need fires" were used to scry, to purify and to sacrifice as
    well. Animals and other offerings were cast into the flames. As we have
    seen in a previous Workshop, cattle were driven between the fires and
    youths engaged in jumping through the flames. (It has been conjectured
    that this practice of flame jumping had its origins in earlier practices
    of human sacrifice.   I personally have not seen a single valid
    reference to Druidic human sacrifices.)  The thought was also held that
    "like attracts like", so that the Power of the flames would also attract
    the Magickal Power of the Sun.

    Being periods of imbalance, the Druids also took advantage of the flows
    of power to perform divinations.  These great fires also served to
    signal the Power of the Druids to all people, as well as to unify their
    control over the minds of the Celtic nations.

                     "The Otherworld, Portals and Domans"

    Although the Celts did not build the megalithic structures found within
    their lands, they were certainly aware of them. Without exception these
    monuments were attributed to the God/dessess, heroes and/or to the
    Tuatha de Dannan. The many dolmens were thought to be passage ways or
    portals to the Otherworld.  Many myths and tales surround trips made to
    and from the realm of the Sidhe by passing through a dolmen archway when
    the Moon was full. Modern archeology has determined that these dolmens
    are actually neolithic burial sites.

                "Bru'gh na Bo'inne (Newgrange)"

    One of the oldest structures in the Western world is found in Ireland
    upon the banks of the Boyne river. This is the Bru'gh na Bo'inne, the
    burial place of Irish kings and the legendary palce of the Dagdha and
    Angus mac Og. The area is also known, in English, as New Grange. This
    structure was erected by the original inhabitants of the land around 
    3206

    3500 BC, predating Stonehenge and being contemporary with the Sphinx and
    the Pyramids of Egypt. The structure was covered with white stones in
    ancient times and would "shine' in the Sun when seen from great
    distances. This is very similar to the way the Great Pyramid was also
    described when seen in the sunlight with it's reflective coating.

    Many ancient Irish legends and tales are associated with this structure
    and the passage of time. Most of these tales are about time standing
    still or seeming to pass without notice. Their stories center around
    Angus mac Og (the Young God), his birth in a day, his attaining the
    ownership of the Bruig for "only a day and a night" (lasting forever in
    endless cycles), and his arrangement of his foster father Midir's
    marriage to Etain (who is the subject of many stories of shapeshifting
    and transformation). 


                        "Spirals, Symbols and Carvings"

    This theme of timeless days and transformation is very important when
    one considers that one possible use of this structure was the taking of
    shamanistic journeys. (Angus himself was visited by an aisling or "dream
    woman" who played for him upon a timpan and eventually they are
    transformed into white birds of enchantment).

    Martin Brennan, an Irish-American, was the first person to note the
    relationship between the carvings at New Grange and the rays of the Sun.
    Using the discoveries of Brennan and our previous information about
    Celtic Shamanism, I am going to suggest that the interior chambers of
    this structure were used for shamanistic ceremonies and journeys.

    Let me describe the geometry of Bru'gh na Bo'inne that a Draoi' priest
    might have encountered when appraoching the structure for religious/Mag-
    ickal ceremonies. The first thing that would be noticed is a brillant
    white bowl or hemisphere shining amidst a sea of green. This mound is
    surrounded by 97 kerbstones and the entire structure is then encircled
    by a ring of standing stones.  At the entrance is a stone that one walks
    around to enter the inner chambers. This stone is covered with spirals
    that have been carved into the stone. The stone is divided by a line
    that is aligned with the Mid-Winter Sunrise, the right hand spirals
    being counter clockwise (tuathal or widdershins) and the left hand
    spirals going clockwise (deosil). This is exactly the same type of path
    through the sky that one would observe for the sun during the year. (In
    fact, if you take a lens and focus the Sun's light on a board and leave
    it in place for a year, a track will burned upon the board in the shape
    of an interconnected double spiral. This experiment was done in the
    early 1970's by American artist Charles Ross.)  The entrace to the
    interior chambers, beyond the entrance stone, is 70 meters in length.
    One must pass beneath three large stones that are thought to be symbolic
    of the Celtic Cosmology, the Sky World, the Middle World and the
    Underworld. Once past this Otherworldly entrance, one encounters a large
    chamber with four smaller side chambers that are oriented to the four
    cardinal directions (North, South, East and West). The inner walls are
    covered with spirals and symbols, among them is an eight-rayed sun
    symbol (depicted within a circle). This symbol as well as the rest are
    selectively illuminated by the Sun's entrance through a small hole in
    the roof box that is oriented directly to the Mid-Winter sunrise. A
    finger of light would shine within the chamber to illuminate the
    carvings, shining in golden flecks upon the chamber walls. Within the
    3207

    main chamber were great stone bowls that were possibly filed with water
    and arranged to further enhance the solar display within by acting as
    mirrors. The seemingly hap-hazard arrangement of carvings upon the walls
    are organized and transformed by the rays of the Sun.

                 "A Night with Angus mac Og"

    Now that the stage is set, imagine yourself to be a seer of the fourth
    millenia BC. You have fasted for days and have spent the long dark night
    of Mid-Winter meditating within the inner chambers of Angus mac Og.  You
    have performed your rituals you have attained a trance-like state and
    you await the rising of the Sun, the new God of Light to return to the
    world. What far journeys or estatic visions will be triggered within
    your Sacred Space by the new Sun's first rays?  A sudden thin ray of
    white light pierces the blackness of the inner chamber with an il-
    luminating shower of images as the inner darkness explodes! Your mind
    reflects the brilliance of the new born Sun as your inner consciousness
    expands into infinity! Your brothers and sisters would follow the dark
    shadow the standing stone to the carn's entrance to find you and the
    inner chamber reborn within the rebirth of the Mid-Winter Sunrise! What
    stories you could tell! What prophecies you could make! I sometimes
    think that Bru'gh na Bo'inne is really the Hyperborean " ...temple of
    the Sun..." mentioned by the ancient Greek writers, rather than
    Stonehenge. 

                        "The Land of the Hyperboreans"

    Perhaps the British Isles are the Islands of the Hperboreans after all?
    Where else is found such a system of large scale, megalithic structures
    all centered around the Sun and the Otherworld? One has only to step
    within any of these raths to be transported to another time or another
    age. Bru'gh na Bo'inne is only one among many such locations.  Three
    great mounds exist in this area of the Boyne river, New Grange is the 
    most elaborate but the nearby mounds of Dowth and Knowth are also
    fascinating.  Dowth is oriented to receive the rays of the setting Sun
    on Mid-Winter while Knowth has two passages and is oriented to receive
    the rays of the Equinoxes.  These chambered passages are not limited to
    Ireland, but are found throughout the British Isles and even in
    Brittany. Two noteable sites are located at Maes Howe in the Orkney
    Islands and at Gavrinis in Brittany. The interaction of carvings and
    site orientation is also wide spread and not limited to just the rays of
    the Sun. Many sites also used the beams of the Moon to illuminate
    passages and special formations. Although these sites could be called
    observatories by those of a purely scientific viewpoint, that would be
    in direct contradiction to the aims and worldviews of their creators. To
    fully appreciate the beauty, majesty and wonder of these Magick sites,
    requires us to use our entire mind. Perhaps we should now consider the
    other great location that has equal claim to being the Hyperborean
    Temple of the Sun?  That location is called Stonehenge.

                                 "Faery Rings"

    Who has nor heard of the mysterious lights that are seen within faery
    rings when the Sidhe dance within the Moon ways? Such lights have also
    been observed within Magickal Circles constructed by Wiccans and modern
    day Ceremonial Magicians. The crop circle phenomena has also been
    associated with light displays and formations. All these phenomena have
    been reported and seen by reliable witnesses (although , as with all
    3208

    such events, there have been cases of fraud as well). The fact is that
    such circlular formations have all been associated with light displays
    and other unexplained phenomena.  It is no coincidence that all of the
    previously mentioned Magickal phenomena are also associated with the
    oldest such locations, the stone circles. Many hundreds of these sites
    are found in Britain, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The two greatest of
    these are Stonehenge and Avebury. I will discuss Stonehenge tonight. I
    may discuss Avebury in the future if it is of sufficient interest to the
    other members of the workshop.

                                 "Stonehenge"

    Has there ever been a place to fire the imagination such as Stonehenge?
    What secrets does it hide as it sits amid the many other marvels to be
    found upon the Salisbury Plains ? This question and thousands more like
    it have passed through the minds of mortals for at least the last 3000
    years. Why was it built? Who built it? How was it used? Can it be used
    again? I'm sure you many have a few questions of your own!<G>  Before we
    get to the questions, let's go through a few of the details we know
    about the site and some of the more recent discoveries that have been
    made regarding its possible uses.

                   "Stonehenge I"

    Stonehenge was built in three phases, starting with the construction of
    Stonehenge I around the year 1900 BC.  This is about a thousand years
    after the Pyramids and the tombs of the Bru'ghna Bo'inne and a few
    hundred years before the fall of ancient Troy and the Oddessy.  The
    first phase of construction was a great circular ditch with banks being
    piled upon either side.  The people building it were late Stone Age
    people, Not much is known about them except that they were hunters. An
    opening was left on the northeast side with four holes being left at the
    entrance that may have contained wooden poles. Two other holes inside
    the enclosure may have held upright stones. A third hole was dug that
    still contains the "heel stone", over which the sunrise is observed. A
    variety of other features are associated with this first phase of
    construction. I shall refer you to "Stonehenge Decoded" by Gerald S.
    Hawkins and John B. White for a more indepth discussion of these or
    other Stonehenge details. The entire structure was about 320 feet in
    diameter and about 6 feet high by 20 feet wide with the heel stone and
    possibly two other standing stones being visible. The entire bank would
    have been glaring white since most of the surrounding surface region is
    composted mostly of chalk. The heel stone rises about 16 feet into the
    air and is about 8 feet thick by 7 feet wide. Around the inside of the
    bank was a series of 56 holes called "Aubrey" holes. These holes contain
    the created remains of men and women from that period. Even in its first
    phase, I'm sure you'll agree, it must have been an imposing structure.

                       "Stonehenge II"

    Work upon the second phase of Stonehenge was begun about 1750 BC by
    another race of people known as the "Beaker People". These people built
    two concentric inner stone rings consisting of 82 bluestones on about a
    70 foot diameter around the center of the mound. The entrance was
    widened in the ditch bank by about 25 feet and a double row of 10
    bluestones was placed in the entrance to the stone circles. This work
    was done during about a hundred year period and was never finished due
    to some unknown interruption. With their departure, the Stone age closes
    3209

    in Britain and awaits the coming of the Bronze Age.

                       "Stonehenge III"

    The third and final phase in the construction of Stonehenge was
    undertaken by the "Wessex People" in about the year 1650 BC. These
    people were much more highly skilled than the "Beaker People" and
    carried on commerce with the peoples of the Mediterranean area. So many
    artifacts are found from these areas that some scientists have developed
    the theory that Stonehenge was finished under the auspices of a "Master
    Builder" from the Mediterranean. Since this is the only large megalithic
    structure attributed to the Wessex People, they may well be correct. The
    previous double ring of bluestones were removed and set aside for later
    use. They were replaced by a single row of huge sarsen stones coming
    from Marlborough Downs. A horseshoe shaped structure consisting of
    "trilithons" was placed inside of the sarsens and aligned upon the
    northeast opening and the center of the new stone ring. These "tri-
    lithons" are not found in other stone circles and are further evidence
    of the sophistication of the builders.  The cross pieces are held in
    place using a woodworking technique called "mortise and tenon" construc-
    tion. All of these stone pieces were hand-worked. The uprights are very
    close together (about a foot or less). The outer circle is 97 feet 4
    inches in diameter. The outer stones are about 14 feet high by 7 feet
    wide by 3 1/2 feet thick. The inner horseshoe is formed by stones
    ranging from about 20 to 25 feet high. A temporary structure which was
    oval shaped was constructed around the sarsen horseshoe that used the
    previously removed bluestones. This oval was removed and the stones were
    later used to form a horseshoe of bluestones inside of the sarsen
    horseshoe. A number of holes was also dug outside the sarsen circles
    called the "Y" and "Z" holes. These are in a pair of roughly circular
    rings around the entire structure.  One stone remains to be described
    and that is called the "altar stone" though no hole has been found for
    it and no use has been clearly defined. It is of a different material
    from the sarsens or bluestones.  It came from a quarry 30 miles away and
    is of fine grained green sandstone with mica flakes. If clean, it would
    glitter in the sunlight. Stonehenge III was completed about 1600 BC and
    now we are left with the Mysteries of its construction and use.

          "A Quick Word about Construction"

    The construction techniques would take an entire Workshop to cover and
    will not be discussed tonight.  I refer you to "Stonehenge Decoded" for
    details.  An estimate was made of the effort required using the
    conjectured techniques and and estimate of 1,500,000 man days was
    determined to be the level of effort required to build Stonehenge. These
    techniques were demonstrated using modern day men to determine how many
    were actually required for each task. I believe the estimate to be
    realistic and accurate. The question remains, "Why undertake such a
    truly monumental effort ?"  Although the "Hows" of Stonehenge are
    fascinating, I am much more mystified by the "Whys"!

           "A Quick Word about Uses"

    I can classify the "Uses" into five categories:
             1. It was used as a Calender to predict the seasons, the phases
    of the Moon, and the times of the Sun Festivals.
             2. It was used as a site for performing Ceremonies (everything
    from sacrifices to Season fesitivals).
    3210

             3. It was used as a Computer to determine Solar and Lunar
    eclipses. (The use as a celestial observatory also fits in here).
             4. It was used as a place to work Magick, take shamanistic
    journeys (similar to a Native American Medicine Wheel), and was used to
    initiate new shamans or priests into the order.
             5. It was used for some other purpose that is subject to
    conjecture and awaits the revelations of our own "illuminations".

    I will attempt to provide details about the site that have been
    determined by computer analysis and let each of you decide for yoursel-
    ves what you think, since tonight we are very limited timewise. We may
    return to these topics for additional details in the future.  

                     "The Computer Analysis"

    How well did Stonehenge predict the Mid Summer/WInter sunrises and/or
    moonrises? When the stone alignments were analyzed by Hawkins in 1961,
    using a digital computer borrowed from Havard University. The analsis
    showed a TOTAL correlation of all major Sun alignments and an almost
    total correlation with alignments of the Moon as well. The accuracy of
    these correlations was within 1.5 degrees. The calculations were based
    upon the positions of the Sun and Moon circa 1500 BC.  When the various
    phases of Stonehenge were considered, it was found that Stonehenge I had
    11 key positions that pointed to ten of the twelve extremes of the Sun
    and the Moon and Stonehenge III pointed 8 times to 8 of the same key
    positions! Needless to say, the position and day of the key Solar/Lunar
    days could be easily determined using Stonehenge as a calendar. (I will
    construct and upload GIFs showing these alignments to Library 16). The
    computer was also used to determine a method where the 56 "Aubrey holes"
    were used to predict eclipses. (BTW 56 is also the number of years that
    the moon takes to complete its entire cycle through the skies). These
    facts have been used to support the arguement that the priests using
    Stonehenge could have reinforced their apparant "power" over the
    elements by not only predicting the "dreaded" eclipses but also to
    "miraculously" cause them to disappear.  I personally couldn't say if
    this speculation is valid. It seems rather cynical to me. Another very
    interesting fact about the location of Stonehenge is that it is almost
    EXACTLY at the right lattitude (51 degrees 17 to allow the Sun and Moon
    azimuths to be separated by 90 degrees. It would seem that the site was
    NOT chosen at random.  

                     "Shamanistic Flights of Imagination"

    Before starting, I'd like to quote the ancient Sicilian historian,
    Diodorus about Britain in 50 BC:

    "The Moon as viewed from this island appears to be but a little distance
    from the Earth and to have on it prominences like those of the Earth,
    which are visible to the eye. The account is also given that the god
    visits the island every 19 years, the period in wish the stars to the
    same place in the heavens is accomplished.  ....There is also on this
    island both a magnificient sacred precienct of Apollo and a notable
    temple.... and the supervisors are called Boreadae, and succession to
    these positions is always kept in their families."

    (BTW the Moon rises farthest to the North every 18 to 19 years as seen
    from the center of Stonehenge).

    3211

    I would like to speculate upon some of the possible Magickal aspects of
    Stonehenge:

             1. The site is situated in the midst of a lot of so called
    "crop circle" activity. Could the energy of these verified phenomena
    also be harnessed by Stonehenge? Could an outbreak of crop circle like
    marks have sparked the neolithic people to have constructed their own
    more permanent circles?

             2. Is there an Earth power that is yet to be discovered by
    modern science. Is this power related to "orgone" as postulated by
    Wilhelm Reich from his work with "bions"?  Reich said that this energy
    could be seen spiralling into the air through tubes made from organic
    matter. His "accumulators" were like batteries for orgone and were made
    of alternating layers of organic and inorganic substances (like the
    roofs of the great chambers at Bru'gh na Bo'inne).  Guy Underwood was
    also a proponent of what he caled "earth force" (also described as being
    spiral in nature). Underwood used divining rods to locate pockets of
    such energy within Stonehenge.

             3. Is there a "Dragon" or "Serpent" power waiting to be
    harnessed within the Earth?  Many of the ancient tombs have such a mark
    above their entrys. The Druids certainly believed it was so. Could
    ancient kings have married the land here as suggested in Marion Zimmer
    Bradley's "The Mists of Avalon"? I know the area is surrounded by the
    burial mounds of many ancient kings.  Is the "Dragon Power" awaiting a
    new infusion of energy from a group of dedicated Magickal practitioners.
    Does the Dragon sleep?

             4. The many solar/lunar occurences at Stonehenge suggest it may
    have been associated with shamanistic practices and initiations in a
    manner similar to the areas of the Bru'gh na Bo'inne. Such a practice is
    suggested in Douglas Monroe's "The 21 Lessons of Merlin".  Is Stonehenge
    a portal to the Otherworld?

                           "Ley Lines"

    One cannot discuss "earth force", "orgone" or the Earth Power nodes such
    as Stonehenge without discussing ley lines. These lines are geomet-
    rically located by standing at a Power node and sighting towards other
    power nodes. Using such techniques, "ley hunters" have determined that
    most of southwestern England is criss crossed by such lines. Are ley
    lines "power conduits" between "power nodes"? To answer this question I
    read "Earth Memory" and "Shamanism and the Mystery Lines" by Paul
    Devereaux, the editor of the "Ley Hunter" magazine and the Director of
    the "Dragon Project". Devereaux has embraced, investigated, evaluated
    and rejected more theories about the "ley lines" than anyone else (as
    far as I know). He acknowledges that "death roads" do exist near many of
    these sites but rejects them as being solely responsible for all ley
    lines. (NOTE: death roads are straight roads leading to such ancient
    centers for the express purpose of burials and funerary processions.
    They are well documented and universal to mankind). His own personal
    theory is that the ley lines are the result of shamanistic OOBE
    conducted at the so called "power nodes". The ley lines are the result
    of marking in this reality the patways that the shamans take in their
    altered reality from one sacred site to another. He suggests that these
    "traces" of the Earth's Spiritual Pathways are the means by which we can
    become re-attuned to the Earth's Power and ancient knowledge.

    Well there we have it, a discussion of Druid Power and Power centers. I
    know from my own experience that Magickal Power is stored within my own
    Solitary home Circle. How much greater can the True Power be at a site
    as special as Stonehenge or Bru'gh na Bo'inne?

          Celtic Workshop #8 - The "Rite of 3 Rays" and the "Gift of Awen"

    As usual, we gathered slowly, in fact I was late. After some brief
    initial hellos, we got started. Freepowder was still trying to live down
    an experience with Coyote (the Trickster) from early in the day!<G> I
    discussed the book "The 21 Lessons of Merlin" by Douglas Monroe as an
    example of a work produced by "Awen". I wanted to give the Workshop
    members a perspective on the pluses and minuses involved with such
    works. I also went over some formal and personal rituals and meditations
    I do to receive "illumination". All in all, a very stimulating evening
    of presentation and dialogue......Searles O'Dubhain

    Tonight I would like to do things a little differently than I had
    planned. Before we discuss the "Rite of 3 Rays" or the "Gift of Awen",
    let's talk about one of the references that I have used and some of you
    may have read, "The 21 Lessons of Merlin".  
     
    As we have previously discussed, not much was written down about the
    Druids by the Druids. The best we can get is the ancient writings of the
    Irish Celtic Culdean Monks who may have been Druids in disguise. Our 
    next best sources are oral traditions found in Celtic families, legends
    and Bardic lore. Comparative analysis between the other ancient In-
    do-European traditions of the Brammans, Greeks, Persians,Egyptians and
    the Siberian Shamans may yield some of the hidden Druidic secrets. A lot
    of the time we are making some educated guesses based upon how similar
    peoples worked Magicks and conducted rituals. Sometimes we have biased
    "eye-witnessed" accounts such as Caesar's or the other Roman historians.
    When a gap exists in our knowledge of Druidic or Celtic practices we
    must do what the ancients did......we must ask that we receive the "Gift
    of Awen". I'll mention some ways that this can happen and what we can do
    to aid our quests for "illumination" a little later in our discussion
    tonight.
     
    What does all this have to do with "the 21 Lessons of Merlin" you ask? 
    ..... The answer is that this is precisely the approach that Douglas
    Monroe seems to have taken in his book. He fills in the gaps with
    concepts that have come to him as illuminations and also uses the
    illuminations of the "Bardic Mysteries" of Wales (also arrived at by the 
    aforementioned methods). Since  we are all humans, some mistakes can
    occur when we interpret our "illuminated" thoughts and concepts. This is
    precisely why ALL SOURCES should be viewed critically and questioned
    (even as our very own Freepowder is prone to do!<G>). I know I constan-
    tly question and compare. Monroe's book has some very good concepts in
    it and some that I dispute. My primary dispute with him is over his
    concepts regarding the sexual polarities and workings of Magick. 
                   
    He states that Druids were segregated in their Magickal workings because
    men and women cannot work together in a symbiotic manner Magickally. He
    says that women receive Magick from men but do not return it when a
    working is done. This is directly opposite my own experiences where I
    have found the presence of women to Powerfully enhance the working of
    Magicks.  He also states that male Druids did not marry and were
    celibate.  That may be true in Wales, but the Irish Druids married and
    3213

    had many children.  Abstaining from sex would have severely depleted the
    Magickal "gene pool"! The Druids were not stupid! I doubt seriously if
    they abstained from sex or procreation! Sex Magick is Big Magick!  (As
    I'm sure we will all agree!<G>). So Monroe does make mistakes....so do
    it.<G> Time and experimentation are the two best tools to evaluate any
    system and the systems of this book will be analyzed fully before we are
    done in this series of Workshops.
     
    Now I would like to briefly summarize what is in "The 21 Lessons of
    Merlin": 
                  1. The 3 Rites of Assumption
     
                  This lesson refers to the manner in which a student can
    first develop the ability to tap Power and to receive inspirations from
    the Higher Consciousness that exist around us. Monroe uses the "Song of
    Amergin", "The Song of Taliesin" and the "Song of Blue Star" to
    introduce us to Druidic imagery and visualization.
     
                  2. The Pelen Tan
                   
                  In this lesson, Monroe says that the "Pelen Tan" or a 
    kind of glass globe with a candle or light inside of it was used to
    create a lighted space under trees that literally caused the area to
    glow with a "blue light" (used by male Druids). He also says that the
    white robes of the Druids emphasized the "black light" effect of these
    fire globes. He says that the female Witches of Avalon used "red lights'
    when performing their ceremonies, giving rise to the association of "red
    light" districts with prostitution in later ages.
     
                  3. The 4 Symbols of Mastery
     
                  This lesson is concerned with the development of Magickal 
    symbols, arch types and correspondences. The concept of "Mastery" over
    the elements is introduced and the need to be creative and original in
    all occult work is emphasized.
     
     
                  4. The Summoning
     
                  A complete rite of Magickal evocation is described here. 
    Monroe tells how to call the shades of the dead from their graves. He
    introduces the use of  herbs and incense into ritual. The specific shade
    being evoked in this ceremony is that of Merlin.
     
                  5. The 4 Signs of Portal
     
                  This lesson shows how to form a Magickal Circle, to call 
    forth the Guardians of the 4 portals to the Otherworld. Symbols are
    given for each Quarter (Air, Fire, Water and Earth) as well as the
    symbols for the "Sign of Three Rays" that represents Spirit or Akasha
    (similar to the Pentagram). The Old ones called are Uscias, Semias,
    Esras and Morfessa of the Magickal cities of the North. The God in the
    form of Herne is also invoked.
     
                  6. The 4 Sacraments of the Earth
     
                  The concepts of sacrifice to the elements upon a "Sun" day
    is presented. (Not human sacrifice BTW).
    3214

                  7. The 8 Grove Festivals
     
                  The eight major grove festivals of Samhain, Imbolc,
    Beltaine, Lughnasadh as well as the Mid-Winter, Mid-Summer Solstices and
    the Equinoxes are described. Some of the special items associated with
    each festival are given.
     
                  8. The 16 Leeches of Diancecht
     
                  The use of herbs in Druidic ceremonies and practices is 
    introduced. A discussion of Reincarnation is given and a Magickal
    journey is undertaken using these herbs.

                  9. The Rite of 3 Rays
     
                  A means of achieving protection is described. The rite is 
    likened to the Ceremonial Magick rite of the Banishing Rituals of the
    Pentagram as practiced by the Golden Dawn.
     
                  10. The Battle of the Trees
     
                  The Oghams are discussed and the "Battle of the Trees" is 
    described. A battle between wizards occurs and the Magick of the trees
    is used to defeat Merlin's adversary, just as the tree Magick was used
    to defeat invaders during the Cad Goddeu (circa 400 BC). One of the nine
    draughts of inspiration is described that will allow the Druid to
    commune more thoroughly with the spirits of the trees.
     
    ................................................................................
    3215
                  11. The 8 Songs of Cycle
     
                  The correspondences of the Oghams to music and the use of
    music in Magickal acts is presented. The use of musical instruments is
    described for the various elements and a tie between the Druids and
    Atlantis is suggested.
     
                  12. The Herbs of Continence
     
                  This lesson centers around Monroe's belief that Druids 
    segregated by sexes for education, Magick and workings. He describes a
    concept called "Duality". He uses a trip to the Sisterhood of Avalon
    (Glastonbury) to present his case. He also advocates celibacy for male
    Druids but not for the Sisters (beyond Maidenhood). Four herbal concoc-
    tions are presented that enhance male sexual powers.
     
                  13. The Gateway Rite
     
                  A visit to Stonehenge is described. The history and lore 
    of the site is mentioned with references to Atlanteans, Hyberboreans and
    even the Tuatha de Dannan. A method of merging with the consciousness of
    inanimate objects is also described.
     
                  14. The Dragon's Eye
     
                  The act of creating Druid fire is mentioned during a visit
    to the Isle of Wight. The ley lines and the Power of the Land are called
    Dragon Power during this lesson. A rite that allows one to "call the
    Dragon" is presented and the symbol for the "Dragons Eye" is drawn.
     
                  15. The Rite of Inspiration
     
                  The use of meditation and Magickal Circles is described to
    allow one to receive enlightenment to the Awen (the inner spirit that is
    illuminated). Two rituals are given and the connection between the Sun
    and Awen is given.
     
     
                  16. The Wild Hunt
     
                  The use of the Mandragon herb is described during a
    shamanic contest between the Druid and the forces of Nature (usually
    done during Samhain). The gains and losses of such a competition are
    mentioned.
     
                  17. The Life Board
     
                  A Magickal symbol for the Three Circles of Existence 
    (Ceugant, Gwyned and Abred) is given. Fionn's ladder is discussed. The
    use of such an empowered Magickal Symbol for makings and pathworkings is
    described.
     
                  18. The Rite of Libation
     
                  A  variety of Druidic draughts is given.

    (2-10,Trailstalker) RE #16:  I thought that Druids were in alignment
    with Nature.  What are they contesting?
    (2-22,O'Dubhain)    This particular lesson is about being in the Woods
    3216

    during the Wild Hunt of Gwynn ap Nudd when the raw primal forces of
    Nature heighten one's inner fears.

    (2-22,O'Dubhain)    It's a rite of Mastery whereby the young Druidic
    Initiate masters himself and faces the power of Nature, the winds, the
    Darkness, the lightnings and such.  So it's really a test to see how in
    tune you are with Nature.

                  19. The Threshold Rite
     
                  The use of herbs and incense to enhance a journey to the
    Otherworld is given.
     
                  20. The Triscale Stones
     
                  Divination using stones is presented. A pathworked trip to
    the Otherworldly city of Caer Idris is made to show the origins of the
    technique. The suggestion is given to find one's personal "oracle tree"
    under which divinations will be optimized. 
     
                  21. The Rite of the Active Door
     
                  The secrets of color and the concepts of invisibility are
    given along with a ritual that opens all occult knowledge to the Druid.
    This Ritual is the rite of passage to the Inner Mysteries.

    If you read this book, you'll see that the Druids are presented doing
    Magicks that harm others at times.  Some of the Druids even do battle!
    This certainly violates the Wiccan Rede that states "Do what you will if
    you harm none"> The fact is that Druids were not Witches and they
    frequently did battle as well as aiding their clans and kings in war.
    The great Druid Amergin aided the Mileseans in their battles with the 
    Tuatha de Dannan. Many other examples exist of Druids harming plenty,
    least of all none. Druids were definitely not Wiccans. Monroe's book
    follows this philosophy, so some may call it "unethical". He also
    advocates the use of a variety of naturals drugs to aid in Magicks, 
    meditations and Illuminations. I personally think these practices are a
    matter of individual judgement and neither recommend nor reject them. Do
    what you will. The choice is yours.
     
                           "The Rite of Three Rays"
     
         This Ritual is similar to the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the
    Pentagram and the Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram performed during
    Ceremonial Magick and Ritual by the Golden Dawn as outlined by Donald
    Craig or Israel Regardie. Monroe gives his version of this ritual in his
    book "the 21 Lessons of Merlin". I haven't found any historical support
    for it in my Celtic references but it seems to be typical of what I
    think a Druid might do. (The Ritual smacks of Egyptian/Thelemic Magickal
    practice IMHO).  Monroe likens the 3 Rays or gestures in this ritual to
    the first 3 Rays of the Mid-Summer Sun over the horizon (the Celts
    called this Awen as well).
     
         This ritual is primarily used to generate Power within the Druid
    for protection or receiving "illumination" according to Monroe.  It uses
    the vibratory energies of sound coupled with the physical act of deep
    breathing and communing with the Sun to create an "altered state" within
    the Druid.
    3217

         Here's the basic steps of the ritual:
     
                   1. Stand in direct sunlight (noon if you can do it).
     
                   2. Close your eyes and breathe deeply to relax and start
    the path to a meditative state.
     
                   3. Once you are relaxed, exhale then breathe in deeply as
    you raise your hands above your head.
     
                   4. Slowly lower your arms while intoning loudly,
    "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" or "I" (The name of Isis in CM or Golden Dawn, this is
    the invocation of the Goddess Power). Bring your arms to your sides.
         
                   5. Repeat this step while intoning "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" or
    "A" for Apophis the Destroyer. Monroe calls this the "Crystal Ray" or
    Ray of Balance and Separation. He says this represents  both Male and
    Female energies and also neither (sounds a lot like the Book of the
    Law).
     
                   6. Repeat again while intoning "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" or "O"
    for the Male God Osiris. This invokes the God Power to your aid.
     
                   7. repeat the arm gestures a final time while intoning
    "IAO" or "EEEEEEE-Ahhhhhhh-OOOOOOOO!" Then open your eyes.
     
     
         At this point the energy has been raised and the work is to be
    done. One could shield from Magickal attack or seek the "Gift of Awen"
    or some other Magickal act.  Monroe doesn't state this but I recommend
    "grounding" afterwards and if possible. Do this by eating and drinking
    a lite meal. (I never recommend doing any Magick on a full stomach).
    Wiccans do similar rituals using athames, wands and swords to draw
    Circles and/or Pentagrams for protection and Ritual. This ritual is nice
    because the 3 movements are tied to the 3 Rays of Awen.  (As with all
    Magick, ritual is very personal, if it feels right do it!<G>). Monroe
    says that one could reverse the direction of the arm movements and the
    intonations to "banish" energies that are directed at you. He also says
    that one could only do the "male", the "female" or the "crystal"
    movements depending on what is needed or banished.  He suggests
    experimenting as do I. I'd next like to discuss some ways that I achieve
    "illuminated states".
     
    (2-24,Nan)          how would you describe the basic differences/simila-
    rities between Wicca and Druidry? (25 words or less <g>)
    (2-22,O'Dubhain)    The Druids use the Sun and the Moon.  And the Druids
    were more political back then.  Nowadays I'd say that the Druids tend to
    be more left brained than the Wiccans and they tend to be more bilateral
    with their Deity worship.

    (2-24,Nan)          a point of clarification for me .......Wicca doesn't
    use the sun?
    (2-22,O'Dubhain)    Most of the major Wiccan celebrations are done under
    the Moon. The Sun is also used but does not play as great a role as in
    Druidry.

    (2-6,Heather & Michel) We have both Wiccans & Druid here, so perhaps we
    can clarify...
    3218

    (2-22,O'Dubhain)    good
    (2-6,Heather & Michel) 
         Wicca uses the sun as much as Druidism. Moon is primarily for
    esbats... Wiccans don't tend to be culturally specific with their
    worship,  while Druids go for mostly celtic stuff and only share 4 of...
    Wicca's 8 festivals.  (At least how we do it.) ... ga
    (2-22,O'Dubhain)    ok!! seems to be a diversity of opinions and
    practices as usual! thanks

    (2-10,Trailstalker) Where would "shamanism" fit in with all of this?  We
    do ceremony under the Sun, the Moon, the Stars,... in swamps, forests,
    deserts, living rooms, ... you get the picture... and what's an
    "esbats"?
    (2-22,O'Dubhain)    Shamanism comes in when you seek assistance from the
    Spirit world or you seek to control the elements.  Esbats are Full Moon
    Wiccan Rituals held every month Sabbats are Major festivals like we
    outlined previously 
    (2-10,Trailstalker) I've found that with shamanism if you are seriously 
    working the path, there comes a time when rather than you working it and
    using medicine items, you more or less become a medicine item for a
    Greater spirit power.  And it works through  you.

    (2-17,Freepowder)   I remember, Druids are left brain based on Bonewits?
    or others too?
    (2-22,O'Dubhain)    Actually Druids are both sided. I think some Wiccans
    tend to reject the left side approach at times Bonewits seems to be left
    brain heavy!<G> IMHO!

    (2-17,Freepowder)   modern druids, as previously cited?
    (2-22,O'Dubhain)    yes.... Modern Druids.

         The ancients were a lot more in tune with their entire minds They
    didn't really draw a line as such. To receive the "Gift of Awen"
    requires us to achieve heightened or altered states of consciousness.
    First let's describe what an altered state is. An altered state of
    consciousness is just that, a different state from that which we
    normally experience. This can be anything from a heightened awareness of
    our physical surrounding to a totally different way of perceiving 
    all of reality. I have basically recognized the following states in
    myself:
         
                      1. Sensing the mood or spirit of the land around me,
    the trees, the streams, animals, the wind, the soul of the Earth. This
    state is achieved by quieting the spirit and/or the mind. Being at peace
    allows the world around us to communicate and touch us. I do this by
    relaxing and releasing my thoughts and emotions. I float and accept. I
    observe what IS. Not what I expect to see. Reality is as it is and not
    filtered by my conditioning.
     
                      2. Having access to the Akasha for inspiration and
    divination. (Usually coming in flashes.) I blank my mind in a manner
    similar to the above process but usually do this in a secluded room
    without light and external distractions. I fix my purpose in my mind and
    seek for an answer. I do not allow anything to distract me. When my
    answer comes, I can immediately recognize it.
      
                      3. Being out of "time sync" with others. Being
    slightly in the future of what's happening around me. This usually 
    3219

    happens to me without trying and sometimes accompanies other heightened
    states. It also happens when I've taken anything with codeine in it.
     
                      4. Seeing "visions", things that are happening in the
    future or the past as if they are happening right now. This state comes
    on me when I have a quest that requires me to see through a different
    set of eyes or a different point of view. I actually let myself just
    look into another world or time through the eyes of a native being
    (sometimes me or a relative, sometimes an artificial construct.)
     
                      5. Sensing people from previous lives. I usually have
    no control of this. It just happens and can be triggered by some
    familiar gesture word or other similar event. I just feel very at ease
    and comfortable (or hostile at times) with the person I've known before.
                      
                      6. Reading minds. (This also just happens). This is
    not in words. It is in images and feelings. I just know what someone is
    thinking or feeling.
                      
                      7. Going out of the body. I have to relax totally,
    isolate all external distractions. I start at my extremities and work
    inward. (Did I mention that I am lying down on a comfy surface?) I
    release all the tension in my physical body first. I next calm my
    emotions, then my thoughts.  Once I only exist within my head, I start
    releasing all external inputs. I shut down all my creative centers. I
    turn off all the monitoring that goes on. I relax and float. If Thoughts
    or emotions enter in, I sink them into the Earth away from me. I banish
    them. I float. Once I am completely isolated and floating in total
    darkness, I try to see behind me and in front of me at the same time.
    This is not possible while embracing the normal physical existence. It 
    can only be done in our Spirit forms. This takes total concentration and
    practice. Not force, just persistence and release. I liken this process
    to what happens when one is born. A long persistent pushing through the 
    birth canal surrounding us. The physical barriers thin out before our
    efforts and suddenly we are born anew on the Astral plane.  I can then
    see in all directions at the same time I am aware of all around me.
    Physical barriers are only thought forms to be ignored at Will. I can go
    anywhere I desire to go. (However I am only a child in this existence
    and am also very aware of the far greater Powers around me). I exercise
    extreme caution when traveling the Astral. It is very easy to be
    "noticed" and to become the object of unwanted attentions. My conscious
    mind distracts me continually as I maintain a hold on my physical
    existence. When i return to me body, I actually have to struggle back
    into it! Part of me wants to stay on the Astral. The barriers that
    separate and protect us from Astral Intrusions are tough to penetrate
    even when we hold the keys! Be careful and cautious and you can learn a
    lot. Slip for a minute and you can be trapped, possessed or lost.
                      
                      8. Communing with the God/esses.
     
         I commune with the God/esses in several ways. I recognize that all
    things have life and Power within them. I especially feel a closeness to
    trees, plants, rivers and lakes. The ocean just overwhelms me with it's
    Power. The clouds constantly change in their forms and interactions.
    Celts believe that places have Spirits. I am a Celt ,by birth but also
    because I feel this Oneness and connection to Nature. You can be a
    Brother or Sister the same way. Birth is unimportant. Who we are in the
    Spirit is very important. The first way to commune with the Spirits
    3220

    is through Nature. When in this state my physical senses are extremely
    heightened.
                      
    The next way to commune with the God/desses is through Ritual. In Ritual
    we open the Pathways within us to be filled with the One Power. We
    invite It within and share Its Touch. Magick is nothing more than
    specialized Ritual and is a focusing of the Power. We can actually
    become the God or the Goddess or some Other at these times. They can
    have a physical body through us. I have sat back at such times and been
    amazed at the words pouring forth from my mouth from the Energy that
    possesses me. This Power is benevolent and will vanish anytime we
    reassert ourselves. I caution those who would try this to be CERTAIN
    that they are within a Sacred Space and are Protected before opening up
    to a Spirit Entity.  All Spirits are not benevolent and some WILL try to
    violate your presence and assume complete control of your body. It
    happens all the time. Watch the news and see for yourself. When out of
    the body and feeling no constraints, it is possible to experience the
    touch of the God/desses. I have felt Their Wonderful Presences filling
    me. I usually feel Their approach as a feeling of tremendous anticip-
    ation. I sense that something monumental is going to occur. Something
    coming to me. The space around my spirit  begins sparkling in golden 
    crystals. Then I experience a thrill of Joy and Happiness. I am
    completed and embraced by the Knowledge of the Ages and The Love of my
    Fellow Spirit. It's beyond words but so very uplifting, comforting and 
    peaceful. I feel that I am where I should be. My sense of my life's
    purpose and my need to finish my work on this plane pulls me back. I
    also feel that I need to share myself with those on the physical plane
    I love. I cannot yet abandon the world of form. I bid Them adieu in
    Perfect Love and struggle back into my body. I carry Their Blessings and
    Love within. I try to share this in my life with others.
                      
                      9. Working with Power.
         
    I always work within a Circle when using Power. This can be a Circle
    surrounding my person in an emergency. I prefer to use traditional
    methods to create Circles more formally. Circles tend to hold residuals
    of the Spells of Protection that are cast for them. My Circle at home is
    such a place. Anyone can enter it but only those that are invited may
    work with Power there. Sleeping within this Circle is guaranteed to make
    you travel and have the strangest of dreams!<G>
     
    To use Power I merely open myself to it. No meditation is necessary,
    though it helps me to be more sensitive to the nuances of Power. All I
    really need is a Magickally isolated place, a Circle. Once I am open, I
    reach for the Power of the Earth and the Sky. I let the Energy flow
    through me. (It feels like it comes into my feet and out of my hands and
    head! This is similar to the way lightning flows.) I leave the stream
    open and charge myself as full as I can get. My hair usually stands up
    a bit and I get all "goose pimply"! I keep in mind the goal of my
    working and I release the Power I've stored. (At the same time the Power
    leaves me, I see it going as a beam of energy. If the Working is large
    or systemic, I tie the beam to the same source I've tapped. This permits
    it to continue after I've released it. (I actually visualize the beam
    remaining and pumping the energy out.) I leave the beam with a spell
    that allows it to quit when the Work is done. I release the Power back
    to the Earth and Sky and thank the God/dess for their help. It helps to
    eat or drink or something equally grounded in Physical Reality after
    such an effort.
    3221
     
                      10. Dying.
     
    This is the Ultimate altered state. I myself have never actually died in
    this lifetime yet. I have been at the Portal many times. I have sensed
    the Ways to Tir na Nog. Always when I am close I sense a peace and a
    surrender within me to the call of the Guardian of the Door. I actually
    laugh from happiness. I have been told to return to this life because my
    Work is not yet done. I have spoken to members of my own family about
    their near death experiences and they are remarkably similar. A
    releasing and a faith in what will come. A sensing that all is right and
    that the Ultimate Will Accomplishes Its Purpose. I have read many books
    and accounts of the experiences of others who have gone through that
    door and returned. My belief in the Afterlife is strengthened by their
    revelations. The ancient Celts and Druids believed so strongly in such
    an afterlife that they sometimes chose to voluntarily accompany their
    loved ones through the Door. Druids would even borrow money to be repaid
    in another life! Needless to say their strong beliefs in another Life
    after this One caused the Celts to have no fear of Death!<G>
     
    I have watched the Spirits of those I love leave their bodies and have
    seen the Light that surrounds them in Happiness. I have seen their
    smiles to have finished their Work and receive their New Lives. Death is
    no End, Death is an Accomplishment and a Release.
     
    How do we tell when these states occur? We don't have to!!!  We are in
    them! They happen to us and we react to them!! We can't mistake them!!
    They are beyond all Time and Space!
     
    Seriously, If you are in one of these states, you feel very "charged up"
    and full of energy. You sense an Exaltation of the Spirit. You are
    extremely "Alive"! You will know and You will enjoy!<G>
     
    How do we induce altered states of consciousness? The answer to this is
    that we "open" ourselves up to them. We release our grasp on the Normal
    state of Consciousness.  We expand ourselves to the limits that are
    actually there and not the ones we are conditioned to accept. Seeing
    things that can't exist in Normal Reality helps sometimes. It shakes us
    out of our conditioning. This can be as simply as seeing a glorious
    Sunset or as strange as seeing a UFO or a Demon. I have achieved altered
    states through meditation, drugs, Circles, Rituals, Drumming, Singing,
    Reading, Dreaming, Involuntary or accidental occurrences, sickness and
    by being Possessed. I don't recommend narcotics or heavy drugs, sickness
    or Possession. Incenses and herbal drinks are ok though. (We'll discuss
    these next week).
                  
                  "Practical Meditation for Awen"
     
    I'll try to elaborate a little here on the practical side of meditation.
    I usually meditate lying down with my head to the North and my body
    relaxed. If I am in Ritual I can Meditate while standing or kneeling.
    The most important aspect to remember is to relax each part of your body
    and mind. I usually start at my extremities (feet and hands). I tell
    myself, "Relax your right foot, relax your left foot, relax your.... and
    so on. I release all the tension in each part and let it flow out. I do
    this several times until I don't feel my body any longer. Next I start
    on my breathing and my heartbeat until they are automatic and transpar-
    ent. Then I quiet my thoughts until only Darkness persists. Next I try
    to ignore the Darkness until I am floating. To go further requires 
    3222

    additional techniques. At this point I am a blank tablet and can just
    rest or I can receive "messages" from Others. It's very important to be
    where you are absolutely secure from unwelcome intrusions of the Spirit
    or the Physical at this time. Without such a safe place, you will always
    be slightly on your guard. It helps if another Being you trust will
    watch over you at this time. This can be anyone from an elemental, a
    totemic animal, a Spirit Guide, a person to a God/dess.  Just thinking
    about how it feels to meditate and then writing this answer, makes me
    meditate.<G> I guess that remembering how it felt to meditate makes it
    easier to meditate the next time you try! Practice makes Perfect!<G>
                  
                                 "Druidic Meditation"
     
    Some of this material was covered previously but I repeat it here for
    clarity and the benefit of those that may no have seen that particular
    Workshop yet!<G> Druidic meditation was usually done for divination and
    foretelling the future. This was called by the names: Tenm Laida,
    Dichetal Do Chennaib and Imbas Forosna.
                  
    Tenm Laida (Illumination by Song) is an altered state usually achieved
    by chanting or singing of a repetitive pattern. This can also include
    drumming and dancing. These activities synchronize the body and mind to
    an external rhythm allowing us to cast off the chains of normal
    existence. This allows you to float at peace within the song (dance,
    beat, mantra, etc.) This is a strictly Druidic or Shamanistic practice
    even though it may look like TM.
                      
    Dichetal Do Chennaib (Cracking  open the Nuts of Wisdom) is a state
    achieved by relaxation and clearing the mind in a Ritual environment. It
    usually involved using some Magickal implement such as a knife, a sword
    or a staff to touch a subject (usually upon the head) or by handling an
    item to discover what secret knowledge was contained within it. This
    information could be events from a person's past life, a detailed
    history of who and what had happened to an object or how and why the
    subject was being hexed or spelled. I know this sounds like ESP but it
    was enhanced through Ritual and relaxation techniques.
                  
    Imbas Forosna (Illumination) was a form of altered state used by seers
    and bards to create or see visions. The Druid would be totally isolated
    from all sensory inputs, sounds, lights and feelings. This was usually
    a very dark room or a covering of hides. The Druid would attempt to
    float and relax. When in the proper state he would signal for the hides
    to be removed or he would open the door out of the Darkness. The sudden,
    instantaneous transition from Darkness to Light would cause them to see
    visions or to spontaneously utter poems, prophecies or achieve a total
    Awareness of the secret Knowledge of their Surroundings. This sensory
    deprivation It was their Ultimate Meditation technique.
                  
    The Druids also used music, colors, trees and numbers to alter their
    consciousness. They were familiar with the Pythagorean Mysteries and may
    have actually been the source of them!<G>
                  
    Druids shared IndoEuropean roots with the Indian Brahmans but I don't
    have any hard data to support any similarities in their practices.
              
                                         "Drugs"
                  
    I have experienced Magickal states from drugs but I don't think the 
    3223

    technique is sufficiently controllable or repeatable. It's like playing
    your Steinway with a sledgehammer. Sure you can play a song but at what 
    cost to the instrument? Plus I find that the songs are usually more
    sophisticated if I don't use the sledge!<G>
                  
    I would caution anyone using drugs to know their track records, side
    effects and purity before starting. Then do them under gradually
    increasing controlled and supervised conditions. Never experiment with
    drugs. 
    There is always a documented lab record of their effects. Know your
    suppliers and don't get the wrong ones! The best recommendation is don't
    do drugs. Your Mind, Body and Spirit can achieve better and more lasting
    results. (As I mentioned previously, some natural herbal drinks and
    incenses seem to aid meditation and ritual. We'll discuss those next
    week).  Well there we have it!  All the different ways to achieve
    illumination to Awen!

    (End of Celtic Workshop #8 - The "Rite of 3 Rays" and the "Gift of
    Awen")
            "Celtic Workshop #9 -  The use of Herbs and Potions"
            
    The role of herbs in healing, Magick, ceremonies and rituals as well as
    in mind alteration were presented and discussed in detail. The effects
    of the most popular Druidic herbs and potions were detailed and
    discussed. Some reformatting was done on the transcript for clarity's
    sake as well. A final note!!!! Please exercise caution around most of
    these herbs!! Some of them are considered to be POISONS! The effects of
    some of the others are very powerful in areas of "mind alteration".  The
    author of one of the texts, used as a reference, presents his suggested
    methods for how the Druids used these herbs (they are ONLY used in a
    greatly dilluted state!). Once again I urge caution and good judgement
    before proceeding. All in all, the Workshop participants evidenced a
    very thorough respect and understanding of the use and effects of these
    herbs.

    Entering Workshop/Seminar 1 room...

                          "Druidic Use of Herbs"
     
    We must look at many sources to determine how the Druids used drugs and
    herbs. Some of these sources are historical (such as the Greek and Roman
    historians). Other sources are the traditions of the Bards and Seanchai.
    Still others are the folk remedies and fables of the major Celtic areas
    of the world (Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Britain).  We can also look
    to information that comes from the inspired "Awen" of others (such as
    Llewellyn Sion of Glamorgan and Douglas Monroe).  Archaelogical evidence
    is also being found (the bodies of sacrificial or other burial victims
    have been recently discovered). Each of these types of sources will be
    matched against the others (where possible) to give us the best possible
    idea of how Druids worked with drugs and herbs.
     
    A quote from one the ancients, Pliny, a Roman, referring to the Druid
    veneration of mistletoe:
     
    "Seldom was the Mistletoe found growing upon the Oak, but on such
    occasion, the Druids gathered it with due religious ceremony, (if
    possible on the 6th day of the new Moon-when the influence of the orb
    was waxing, and said to be at its height.  Following an elaborate 
    3224

    banquet, a white-clad priest cut the plant from  the oak tree with a
    golden sickle, while another Druid held out a white cloak for its
    reception. They believed that the Mistletoe, immersed in water within a
    cauldron, would impart fecundity to barren animals, and that it is the
    antidote for all poisons - its name meaning 'all healing.'"

    (2-1,Freepowder)      there are 2 varietys of Mistletoe.... american and
    european, the effects of them are almost opposite... european lowers BP,
    american raises.... the *berries* of either are deadly poisonous. GA

    (2-11,Rhianna)        Foxglove is another example - Digitalis (which
    comes from (foxglove) is a poison, yet it's used for treating heart
    patients.

    (2-28,cherokee)       my gt grandma used mistle toe to bring prople out
    of fevers and unconsciousness.  aspirin bark is poisonous too. its all
    in how you prepare it

                          "The 16 Leeches of Diancecht"
     
    Diancecht was the physician of the Tuatha de Dannan.  He healed their
    wounded during and after their Battles with the Fomorai and the
    Firbolgs. He is the God of Herbs and Medicines.
     
    The following list contains herbs listed in "the 21 Lessons of Merlin"
    and contains their correspondences to the four elements as well as their
    applications. How to prepare a suitable "store" of these medicines is
    also given. The recommended dossages are also given.  Note: Some of
    these herbs can be considered "POISONS"!  I heartily recommend using
    extreme caution with them. I have attempted to identify those that may
    be considered harmful. Please proceed at your own risk. I must say that
    3225

    generally Monroe stays away fron poisonous herbs in topical or internal
    medicines. He does use some very dangerous substances in some of his
    recommended incenses. a long list will follow please bear with me!<G>

    To activate these drugs, the Druids would include a small amount of
    Mistletoe preparation to each before use. Since it was considered "all
    heal".
     
                          "Draughts of Inspiration" (Only one is given)
     
    These drinks are thought to instill the correct state of mind  required
    for "Awen". According to Monroe, nine exist in total, though only one is
    given in his book. Perhaps we can discover the others? I suggest that
    the other tree barks that were used are from the red chestnut, white
    chestnut, Elm, Beech, Larch, Oak and Fir trees. I would guess these
    based upon Hints contained in "Practical Celtic Magick" by Murry Hope.
    I also would guess that ivy was used in a draught based upon information
    from Scott Cunningham's "Encyclopedia of Magickal Herbs".
     
                              5 tablespoons of spring water
                              1 pinch Evening Primrose Flowers
                              1 pinch Black Willow Bark
                              1 pinch Thyme
     
    sit in Glass bottle (closed in the Sun) for 3 days strain/ add 1 tsp
    apple cider vinegar before use add 1 tsp chlorophyll (alfalfa) take 3
    drops subligually prior to Magickal Workings with trees/plants.
     
                            "Threshold Smoke"
     
    These concotions are used to aid one in having an Otherworldly ex-
    perience. They are cast upon the flames of a fire. Please note that some
    of the ingredients are POISON! and that another one of them is con-
    sidered "illegal". The use of these herbs are indicated to aid solitary
    meditations in the deep woods. Be aware that they will induce "Dark
    Visions" and reveal your inner fears. According to Monroe, the Druids
    required one to master such fears to be in tune with Nature and to
    achieve "Balance"..I recommend that none of them be tried when unsuper-
    vised and I also recommend extreme caution.
     
                          To make the incense:
     
                                  Blend and compound the following plants:
                                  Neckweede (Hemp)
                                  Nightshade (Belladonna) (poison) 
                                  Ghostflower (Datura)
                          Keep in a dark (light free) box.
     
                          Burn as an incense to facilitate "threshold" 
                          and "traveling" works.
     
    3227

                              "The Spirit of the Mandrake"
     
    This incense is used to attain a state of altered consciousness for
    resolving one's inner fears and becoming one with the Spirit of the Land
    and its animal Nature. I caution anyone considering using it to be aware
    that Mandrake is considered a POISON! This herb is used during the Night
    of the Wild Hunt that we discussed last week.
     
    Toss dried Mandrake (poison) root upon a bed of hot coals or embers and
    let the smoke cause you to travel within the darkness of the night. May
    apple, Peony; Ginseng or Briony roots may be substituted (also con-
    sidered poisonous!).
     
                         "The Song of Bluestar"
    Another herb used to achieve altered states was the Bluestar flower or
    the Blue Morning Glory. This  plant is considered poisonous! Do not eat
    or drink anything made with it and handle it with care. Monroe suggests
    drying the flowers and seeds to make an incense for a rite of assumption
    or tapping into Powers. This  might also be called "mind expansion". 
    (The same plants have been used to create LSD in recent times, so I am
    not surprised that they are used here). I'm not advocating that anyone
    of you try this incense, but Monroe says the Druids did. I'm not
    surprised.
     
    Here is the essence of the trip or rite of assumption:
     
    "I will be as a Bluestar upon a field of Green, circling upward towards
    a golden Sun."
                          .... translation by D.W.Nash
     
    The Druids believed all life was interrelated from the lowest forms to
    the highest. This quote from the ancient Welsh document, the Mathnawai, 
    shows their philosopy:
     
                          "I died as a mineral and became a plant,
                          I died as a plant and rose to an animal,
                          I died as an animal and I was a man.
                          Why should I fear?
                          When was I ever less dying?
                          Yet once more I shall die as a man,
                          to soar in the Blessed Realm;
                          but even from godhood
                          I must pass on...."

    One further quote from "The Gorchan of Maeldrew":  "Each atom an
    evolving life, each blade of grass a potential soul."

                   "The Draughts of Oblivion"
     
    I give here the "fast" (meaning quick to make) version of Celtic drinks
    and libations from the "21 Lessons of Merlin" as well as the festivals
    at which they are used:
     
                                  May Mead for Beltaine

    Add a half ounce of each of the following to 1 gallon of your favorite
    white wines:

                                  leaves. Let sit for about 6 hours. Filter
                                  and chill before serving.

                                  petals. Let sit for about 24 hours. Add  
                                9 tablespoons of honey and 1 teaspoon  of
                                  vanilla. Filter and chill before serving.
     
                                  Samhain Absinthe
            
    Add a 2 teaspoons of each of the following to 2 pints of your favorite
    port wines:
                                  wormwood, dried apple/mint leaves, dried
                                  pumpkin blossoms. Let sit for about 1    
                              week. Filter through muslin and bottle.      
                            Garnish with raisins and cloves before         
                         serving.
     
                                  Midwinter Mulsa
     
    Add a half ounce of each of the following to 2 quarts of your favorite
    dry white wines:              crushed juniper berries, wintergreen,
                                  Elder Flowers. let sit for about 6 hours. 
                                  Filter and chill before serving. Garnish 
                                  with a sprigg of green pine or hot with  
                                a cinnamon stick

    Now these are drinks I can get excited about!  I think we can all see
    that Druids used a variety of herbs in their work....from "visions" to
    partying.

    Our Cyber Tuatha gathered upon the moors and among the raths once more.

    (2-8,O'Dubhain)         Celtic Workshop #10 - 
                       The Act of "Becoming" and The Charm of "Summoning"
            
    Tonight's workshop is advertised to cover the following topics and I
    intend to give them all my best efforts at explanation.  Tonight's
    topics are:

                   How to actually influence your surroundings. 

              How to perform Weather Magick, to call animals to you, to
    improve your crops and to influence the outcome of events. 
      
              How to discover your past life, find your Inner Teacher or
    Self. 
      
              How to summon "Spirits" to your presense.

    I am being ambitious in talking about these topics!<G> I trust we can
    cover them all tonight and I also hope to have many contributions by all
    of you regarding your own personal experiences in these areas. We will
    learn from our "Inner Druids"! <G>

    The key words to remember tonight are "Becoming" and "Summoning". They
    along with "Will" and "Authority" are the basis of most Druidic and
    Celtic Magicks.

    What do I mean by "Becoming"? What does this act have to do with Magick?
    How did Druidsdo this? I asked myself all of these questions before
    making this act a topic for tonight's workshop. The inspiration for the
    act of "Becoming" is the "Song of Amergin" from the ancient Irish
    manuscript the Leabhar Gabha'la (Book of Invasions). Hear now the words
    of the Druid Amergin:

                            "             The Mystery

                             I am the wind which breathes upon the sea.
                             I am the wave of the ocean.
                             I am the murmur of the billows.
                             I am the ox of the seven combats.
                             I am the vulture upon the rocks.
                             I am a beam of the Sun.
                             I am the fairest of plants.
                             I am a wild boar in valour.
                             I am a salmon in the water.
                             I am a lake in the plain.
                             I am a word of science.
                             I am a point of the lance in battle.
                             I am the God who created in the head the fire.
                             Who is it who throws light into the meeting 
                             on the mountain?
                             Who announces the ages of the Moon?
                             Who teaches the place where couches the Sun?
    3230
                                                              (If not I)"

    This was the translation by Dr. Douglas Hyde from his work "Literary
    History of Ireland". This poem was once as well known in the Celtic
    world as the "Lord's Prayer" is in today's world. It is said to be the
    first verse made by the Mileseans as they arrived in Ireland (circa 1000
    BC). This is also an incantation by a mighty Druid and is a good
    illustration of the act of "Becoming". Amergin is using the Magickal Law
    of Identification that is given by Isaac Bonewits in his book "Real
    Magick":

    "The Law of Identification ...states that by maximum association between
    your metapattern and that of another entity, you can actually "become"
    that entity and wield its power."

    Bonewits is a Neo Druid and the founder of the group A'r nDrai'ocht
    Fe'in (ADF for short though it really means "Our Druidic Magick" in
    Gaeilge).  This act of "Becoming" is one that is not lightly undertaken.
    The danger exists of being trapped within the other entity (whether
    natural, human or spiritual). I suggest you not actually try this sort
    of thing until you know your True Will (exactly who you really are
    without self delusion).  This was also true of the Greek and the
    Egyptian Mysteries. Their first and major requirement was "Gnothi se
    auton", literally "Know thyself"! The ability to control and return to
    one's being is linked directly to one's knowledge of Self. Sometimes
    this process goes the otherway as well, as when a Wiccan "Draws Down the
    Moon". The threefold Goddess actually Manifests within the High
    Priestess (HPS) in such a ceremony. She who has no Name is benevolent,
    usually, so that this possession results in the HPS afterwards being
    returned to control of her own body. "Becoming" is a two way street and
    a matter of "Will".  

    Now that we know a little about the act of "Becoming", I think you can
    appreciate just how great a Druid that Amergin was....he "became"
    multiple entities at the same time in his Invocation of the Mystery. He
    controlled all of these elemental powers and made them his own. This act
    of Power allowed the Mileseans to land upon Eireann though they were
    opposed by the Magicks of the Tuatha de Danaan. He also lived to do
    other Magicks (though I must say that his invocation of Ireland is
    rumored to have caused him to marry and join the de Danaan within the 
    spirit world of the Sidhe). We must remember that Amergin was a Druid
    and so had studied his arts intensivly for anywhere from 12 to 20 years
    as a minimum. He was able to return to hinself after such Magical
    Working because he knew his True Self and Will. This strong connection
    is the Way of Return for us all. I urge that you all exercise due
    caution when "Becoming". Know yourself first.

    Another saying worthy of note while discussing the act of "Becoming" is
    a common saying of the ancient world that I quote from Doreen Valiente's
    book "Natural Magic": "Ten measures of magic were given to the world.
    Egypt took nine. The rest took one."

    I include this saying here to establish one other connection....that of
    the Druids to the Egyptians. The lineage of Amergin and the Gaels
    includes his mother Scota (daughter of the Egyptian Pharoh) as well as
    Mile and Niall "of the Languages" a Scythian prince from Syria. No small
    wonder then that Pliny, a noted ancient scholar, says of the Druids in
    his work "Natural History" that the Druids practiced Magick with such
    elaborate ritual that it would almost appear that it was they "who had
    3231

    taught the Persians". These are none other than the Magi or "wise men"
    from whom the word Magick is derived. Another ancient historian, Dio
    Chrysostum groups the Druids together with the Persian, Hindu and
    Egyptian priesthoods regarding their use of magical powers. While I'm
    connecting Magical schools, I may as well say that Liber Al vel Legis
    (The Book of the Law) is the channeled revelation of the Egyptian
    dieties Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit (Otherwise known as Isis, Osiris
    and Horus) Horus is two in one, Horus and Harpocrates or Set/Apophis).
    We have already seen the use of these three godnames in the "Rite of
    Three Rays" from a previous workshop. This was the intonation of the
    sounds "IAO" used when invokiing the One Power. In Thelemic Magick the
    Book of the Law is the basis for the revelation of a "New Aeon" or "New
    Age". It was channeled in 1904 by Aleister Crowley 90 years ago this
    month. "Do what thou wilt is the whole of the Law". "Love is the Law,
    Love under Will". (caps are mine).

    I have digressed quite a bit here but I think the time is well spent.
    Celtic Magick is tied through the Druids to the Egyptians and the
    Persians to a far older Magick arising out of Summeria and from there
    beyond time. It is true and powerful Magick and I give the same caution
    to you that I gave about herbs last workshop....think long and hard and
    with great deliberation before undertaking this journey. Once the path
    is taken, the journey must be completed.

    Now I finally get to my first topic of the night!  <G>:

                "How to actually influence your surroundings" 
        
    The key to any act influencing the world around us is to be in tune and
    in touch with it first. You must hear the tune before you can change the
    music or even write your own song. I suggest a lot of meditation in
    Nature. Find a spot that "speaks" to the Pagan within you. Be at Peace
    and "feel" the pulse of Nature, the God and the Goddess. Once this
    rapport has been established, one is ready to influence the surround-
    ings. The Druids left us few writings concerning their spells and
    Magicks.  We must "rediscover" these Works by looking at the Magicks
    that are done in the world today and by Using our "Druid filters" and
    "Celtometers"!! <G>  I have included examples of such "Natural Magics"
    from my own experiences, the experiences of other Witches and Druids as
    well as those that I found in the writings of Doreen Valiente, Bonewits
    and Scott Cunningham.

                       "How to perform Weather Magick" 

    For weather Magickal examples I turned to our very own Thunder Being,
    Shadow Hawk, shaman and wizard extraordinaire!<G> He obliged me with a
    few examples:

         The first example involves the  control of weather fronts and rain.
    Our favorite shaman uses the techniques of dancing and drumming to
    attain a higher state. He invokes the Lightning beings and they join the
    dance with him. By being so in tune with them he can ask that they do
    his bidding. If he must act upon an existing weather front, he sends his
    "power animal", Dragon into the clouds. Dragon is a manifestation of
    this Shaman in the power planes. Dragon then interacts with the clouds
    and controls the storms. When the work is done, he is recalled to his
    shaman. The use of such a "power animal" or Magickal construct allows
    the wise shaman to "become" one with the elements of the storm and 
    3232

    influence them without "losing himself" in their wild natures. The
    connection is retained with the Self (Shadow Hawk) back upon the ground
    while the power animal (Dragon) works among the clouds. The use of such
    Power has its price.... Shadow Hawk suffers sever headaches for three
    days following these episodes.

    The second example of how our Dark Shaman uses the weather for Magick is
    in charging his Magickal tools: his sword, wand and athame. During a 200
    MPH hurricane, he faced the Power of the storm, shouting out the
    invocation of the Quarters, forming a Magickal Circle and calling the
    storms Power into his sword, his wand and his athame. He also captured
    the storm's rain in a cauldron for later magickal workings. Can't you
    see him with the storm's winds lashing at his cloak? Sword upraised as
    lightnings crash all around him, exploding in sparks and reflecting in
    eerie blue lights off the steel of his blade and the aura of his
    Magick!!! He has used these tools in many Powerful workings.

                         "How to call animals to you" 

    This is a matter of "becoming" the animal in your mind and "willing" it
    to come to you.  Actually the "Beastmaster" movie illustrated this
    technique quite well. Most good hunters do this subconsciously and
    naturally.
               
                         "How to improve your crops"  
              
    In this Working, invoke no other spirits than your own. Burn no fires
    nor incenses. Carry four stones with you that have been blessed by you
    in a previous ceremony. Set these stones to define the area that is to
    be planted. Cast a Magickal Circle within this field. Sit upon the
    ground and place both hands upon the earth at your sides. Feel the
    earth, it's dampness, its fertility, its calm. Reflect upon your needs
    and the crops you are about to plant.  Next recite a suitable chant or
    poem. I like this one: 

                                   "Go maith raibh agat, na mBande'.
                                    Go maith raibh agat, na De'.
                                    Go maith raibh agat, talamh me'ith.

                                    Cuirim fad beannacht na greine thu.
                                    Cuirim fad beannacht na gealai thu.
                                    Cuirim fad beannacht mo chroi' thu.
            
                                    Go me'adai Bhri'de do sto'r san 
                                             ba'isteach de earrach.
                                    Go me'adai Danu do sto'r san 
                                            greine te de tsaamhradh.
                                    Go me'adai Dagdha do sto'r 
                                           san gaoth ple'isiu'rtha fo'mhar."

    As I sit and reflect upon the bounty that the Land has given me I give
    back to the earth of my own personal Power. I remember the blessings it
    has bestowed to me and my pleasure in its well being.  After a suitable
    amount of reflection and meditation, I arise to do my plowing and to
    plant my seeds for another turn of the Wheel.
          
                   "How to influence the outcome of events" 

    3233

    I try to create a feeling of Positive Magick within me. I banish all
    negative thoughts. I surround myself with a glow of positive golden
    energy. I tap the flows of the earth and the sky and "project" a
    creative field all around me. I find that this works well in casinos and
    just before having important meetings. It helps to strongly visualize
    the outcome that is desired and to see the results occur and not the
    actions that cause them. Let events sort themselves as they may. Let the
    Magick work. Be patient and await the rewards.
     
                       "How to discover your past life"

    Some people use tapes and hypnosis to do past life regressions. Perhaps
    some of you have and can share those experiences with us tonight. I find
    that what works best for me is to read about a time to understand the
    events of that period and to set the stage for my Work. I then allow
    myself to "daydream" and reflect about that time and to see myself
    within it. What usually happens next is that no revelation comes to me
    immediately. I maintain my focus over perhaps as long as three days
    constantly checking to see if my "dream" search has produced any
    results. When I least expect it, sudden revelation will show me a scene
    from a past life and my part in it. It's like seeing a photograph from
    an album for me.
          
                  "How to find your Inner Teacher or Self"  
          
    This is the start of all real Magick, finding your True Will. Many
    techniques exist for doing this in a variety of books, everything from
    "the 21 Lessons" to Donald Michael Kraig's "Modern Magic". I will relate
    how it happened to me. I studied the works of Magick, Science and
    Religions (as many as I could find). I sought for the Truth that was
    external to me.  I was a bulldog chasing down many paths and wrestling
    with many concepts. The Truth eluded me, always constantly out of mu
    grasp....the fox and the grapes. I was incredibly frustrated.  One night
    I gave it all up. As I lay in the Silence of my mind, I left all of the
    mundane world behind and suddenly I was surrounded by Spirit in a place
    not a place. It was not within me...I had ceased to exist I was the
    student and the Spirit was the teacher. Since then, if I have need of an
    answer, I create a sacred space for me to be silent and I await
    enlightenment. I listen to my Inner Guide.  Sometimes the lessons are
    easy and othertimes I have to learn the hard way. (Frequently I get off
    of My Path and am "guided back" with many "object" lessons kicking me in
    the seat of the pants<G>)! I would be interested in hearing how anyone
    else found their True Will.  Mine search was long and hard and I still
    stray in confusion at times!<G>

                           "How to summon 'Spirits'"

    I will give an example of how to summon the Spirit of Merlin as found in
    the book "The 21 Lessons of Merlin" by Douglas Monroe. Before we begin
    there is a chant we must learn in old Welsh:

                                    "Bedd Ann ap lleian ymnewais fynydd
                                          lluagor llew Ymrais
                                     Prif ddewin Merddin Embrais."

             the meaning:

                                   "The grave of the nun's son on 
    3234

                                    Newais Mountain:
                                            Lord of Battle, Llew Embrais, 
                                            Chief Magician, Myrddin Emrys."

            the pronunciation:

                                    "BETH AHN ahp T-Lay'in, eem-NEW-ais
                                     FEEN-ith
                                        T-loo-AH-gor T-loo EEM-rais
                                     Preeve DEW-in MEER-thin EHM-rihs."

    I find that using an unusual language in a chant helps me to free myself
    from the chains of the mundane and allows me to focus upon the Working. 
    After memorizing the above chant one must search for a suitable
    site....a grave yard or burial ground that is isolated from prying eyes
    and situated upon a hill. This sounds hard but is not impossible to do.
    I know of such a place where my great, great grandfather and grandmother
    are buried upon a hill beneath a copse of trees in a farmers fields.
    Many such spots exist... though work can find them (and hopefully also
    permission to use them). 

    Pick a suitable night for the ritual, Samhain being the absolute best
    night. Gather nine pumpkins that are carved with faces (though candle
    holders will do...just not as spooky).  Set the circle up the day before
    the ritual as you don't want any distractions from your Work. Arrange
    the pumpkins with candles around you in a circle (about arms width) with
    the faces looking outward. Always light the candles from within the
    circle. Pick a suitably soulful dirge (for meditation and mood setting) 
    from your favorite songbook (Monroe suggests his but you know what you
    like better). Sing this song as you meditate and reflect upon the
    Working. Place an iron cauldron within the circle upon a bed of coals.
    Into this cauldron place a mixture of an herb, a flower and a tree
    (Monroe suggests using 1 part wormwood, 2 parts Ghostflower (Datura) and
    3 parts Yew (juniper or cypress) as an incense mixture. (Store bought
    incenses work just as well and can be burned in an incense burner
    instead of a cauldron). Start the entire ritual at 30 minutes before
    Midnight.  At precisely Midnight throw additional incense on the coals
    and recite the above invocation nine times without stopping. "Become"
    one with the chant! See into the Darkness! Expect the coming of Myrddin
    Emrys! Sit quietly and await the coming of the shade of Merlin! You may
    ask for the answers to three questions. Release the shade by extinguish-
    ing the fire and incense completely, then extinguish the 9 circling
    fires of the pumpkin heads. You can  now pack up and leave. The key to
    successfully working this Magick is setting the mood, performing the
    meditations and reflections and reciting the invocation properly. The
    ritual can be adapted to allow you to invoke other Spirits as well to
    equal effect.

    The ancient Gaels would do similar rituals to communicate with the dead.
    They would usually lay  and sleep upon the grave of the person to be
    summoned while fasting, until the shade appeared. This process was not 
     lightly undertaken by them, as the dead could be quite dangerous to the
    living, wanting to regain the pleasures of the flesh (hence the need for
    the Magickal Circle of pumpkins and light). In a previous workshop I
    told how the Ta'in Bo' Cuailnge was recovered by a young Druid sleeping
    upon the grave of Feargus Mac Rioch. I'd like to caution you all once
    more to do these rituals only when in dire need.  That's why it's
    important to do two things...
    3235

                            1. Always work within a Circle.
                            2. Have someone there that can aid you if things 
                              get out of hand. This means severingthe      
                             connection and banishing the entity.
    This is also why it's so important to know your True Will. When you have
    that anchor you can come back from anywhere. I know... because I have
    done it. It's like climbing a hill though...

    (2-28,cherokee)         Rhianna, I think as od said it's important to
    remember that you are working with very powerful energies. You must be
    pure and centered before doing the work. The indians believe it is not
    possible for an animal to take over a human because the animals are here
    as guides who keep us close to our source.


    Celtic Workshop #11 - "Walking between the Worlds" and "Journeys on the
    Wheel"
            
    We met on Tuesday evening because the online Bealtaine Ritual was on
    Monday. The topics of discussion were Out of Body Experiences (OOBE),
    Astral Travel and Inner Journeys. An example of a "pathworking" on
    Fionn's Wheel was given.

    Tonight's workshop discusses Astral Travel and Inner Journeying.
    Tonight's topics are:
     
                                    Out of Body Experiences
     
                                    Astral Travel
     
                                    Example Inner Journey on Fionn's Wheel
     
    Tonight we talk briefly about the subject of Out of Body Experiences
    (OOBE). Thisexperience is the means by which one can effect or achieve
    Magick. It is central to the methods behind the Magickal Law: "As Above,
    So Below". A complete workshop will be offered here soon by another, so
    I touch briefly on these techniques tonight.

    Three excellent books on these subjects are:
            
                                    Astral Projection by Denning and
                                    Phillips.
     
                                    Journeys Out of the Body by
                                    Robert A. Monroe.
     
                                    Traveling With Power by Ken
                                    Eagle Feather.
     
    I will present the results of an Inner Journey later, using Fionn's
    Wheel as a guide to the Astral Archtypes within each of us.
     
    The basic techniques of OOBE are these: "disassociation" and "release". 
    Another word for "disassociation" is "meditating".  Meditating allows us
    to break free from the conditioning forced upon our thoughts by the ever
    so mundane, so-called "normal" world. It places our mind into a rhythm
    that allows it to "vibrate" in resonance to other realities (some might
    say other dimensions or even other worlds). I achieve this state by 
    3236

    going through a process of literally forcing myself to "relax". I relax
    my extremities first, then my legs, arms, trunk, head, breathing, heart
    and lastly, my mind. The body is calmed by physically lifting, then
    releasing a body part and "feeling" the waves of relaxation flow inward
    and up the body. This is done in succession until only the mind is
    active. 
     
    Once totally within the mind, relaxation of thought must occur. I
    achieve mental quietness by visualizing a totally "Black" void into
    which all thoughts, feelings and flickers of thoughts and feelings are
    fed.  This process continues until all is "black".  I float before a sea
    of Darkness. I see nothing, I feel nothing , I am nothing. Once this
    state is achieved, one may proceed to "travel" or have an OOBE.
     
     
                              "Leaving the Body"
     
    To leave the body requires an additional two steps: an increase in the
    vibratory rate of the Spirit and a "pushing" out of the body. I am lucky
    that I seem to have discovered these techniques while experimenting on
    my own. The proper level of Spiritual vibration or "ecstasy" is achieved
    by further relaxation and through belief or "Will". I totally believe
    that my Spirit can leave my body and do anything. This focused and
    concentrated belief through Will is the essense of all Magick. It is
    absolutely necessary to achieve results. Some might call this process
    "faith". It is the stuffby which mountains are moved and with which
    entire worlds and even universes are created.  It is also the basis of
    Love and it is through Love that most of us discover the Power that we
    all have to create and perform Magick.
     
    Everyone from Ahura Mazda to Jesus to Crowley says the same thing about
    this process. Love is Power. It is the fundamental requirement for
    creative Work. Let us soar upon the wings of eagles and fly on the wings
    of doves into the Astral.  I "key" the process of leaving my body to
    seeing in every direction at the same time. This is impossible for me to
    visualize or to consider in my "normal" existence while contained within
    the physical shell of my skull and the confines of my body.  
     
    The "Darkness" I have achieved by relaxation of the mind is seen as a
    balloon. I see only one side of it. As my Magick squeezes this balloon,
    it expands toward me and through me until I am surrounded by the
    Darkness. While this process of transformation and metamorphesis occurs,
    I maintain constant contact with all aspects of the Darkness that I
    encounter when the passage is complete, I see the inside and the outside
    of the Dark Bubble.  I see in two directions! This is one step. I take
    as many steps as are necessary, piling belief upon work and work upon
    belief until no direction is unseen. I see myself from without and
    myself from within. I float and I create.  I "travel" and I do anything
    I can conceive.  My existence is a "waking dream". I am the master of
    Reality. I am a new creation! This is the essence of OOBE. Where one
    goes from here is for a more advanced workshop. I trust the New Age
    forum OOBE Workshop will be just such an experience for all of us. I
    plan to be a part of it and I trust you will all join me there.
     
                   "A Journey Through the Veil at Bealtaine"
     
    In the spirit of this Bealtaine season and to Honor the Mother of Summer
    and the Lord of the Greenwood, I took out a copy of Fionn's Wheel to use
    3237

    as a focus for my reflections and musings. I found a quiet spot with no
    distractions and I gazed upon the Magickal Oghams of the Wheel. I sought
    guidance about the world around us and clarity as to my purpose. As I
    gazed upon the symbols, a mist began to form and I slowly began to
    journey. The veil between the worlds is thinnest on the spindle of the
    Wheel this night. What follows is the story of my journey upon the
    pathways of the Wheel:  (A voice within my mind spoke to me.)
     
    "Tonight is a night of Magick. Come with me into the rath ..enter the
    home of the Sidhe. Let us walk the moonways and take the path of the
    journey within:"

    <The mists arise in the meadow and gather in whorls and spirals. The air
    is filled with mystery. A strange call sounds...
                            can you hear it?...shivers and silvers..
                            bells?... or ... harp strings and laughter?
                            We are called...called are we....called...

                            time is not here...reality dissolves...
                            consciousness journeys within.
                            Into the night i must go...on spirit wings,
                            leaving this world behind!! I must go!

                            Only me...the spirit me survives!
                            And my heart lives on in echoes! It 
                            calls to me across the void as I journey. 
                            Hear the beat of my heart's drum...hear
                            the beat of life's blood...my thoughts
                            are a rhythm...a drumming, a rhythm of
                            life and thought across the shimmering
                            moonways....come within .....within..

                            ...in waves and we float..we float as
                            the waves...the waves...the waves...
                            come to us ..... we are...not

                            swirling in light and darkness....how
                            can this be? Where can we be? How?

                            the night, a shooting star across the skies.
                            I am alone once more looking at the wheel,
                            wondering about myself...Who am I? What
                            does this mean? What awaits me? What awaits
                            us all?  We are alone and the Wheel turns.
     
                            Once more I gaze upon Fionn's wheel...
                            and know my journeys continue....It's
                            knowledge is my shield. I am a sword and
                            the fires of summer beckon to us all.
     
    Such is the nature of an Inner Journey. I continue to see this journey
    and to reflect upon its meanings to me and to who I am. I recommend that
    each of you also undertake such journeys for yourselves. Go within to
    your Inner Guide and travel the Wheel.  Journey the pathways of Fionn to
    Wisdom and Knowledge. Beannacht libh!  That was my experience in an
    Inner Journey.

    Celtic Workshop #12 - The "Outer Darkness", the "Dragon's Eye" and the 
    "Many Speckled Rainment"

    This Workshop was presented and hosted by Searles O'Dubhain. We covered
    the basis of Druid Magick or Drai'ocht. We discussed the "Dragon" or
    "Serpent" Power that is inherit in the Land. We touched on the many
    different areas of knowledge and discipline necessary to be a Druid. We
    also discussed the Mysteries of "Death" and "Rebirth". Some preliminary
    socializing soon gave way to the formal presentation and discussion:

    Here is what I hope to cover tonight:
     
                                 The Road to the Grove.
                                 The Druidic concepts of Being. 
                                 The use of the Power of the Land
                                 in the Rite of the "Dragon's Eye". 
                                 The "ley lines" and the "death roads". 
                                 The attainment of Druidic enlightenment 
                                 (Initiation to the Inner Mysteries) 
                                 Authority and the "Many Speckled Rainment"
            
                            "The Road to the Grove"
     
    There are many paths to Magick though only One True Magick IMHO. The
    Grove is a home to this Power as is the Circle and the Temple. How do we
    attain the Power to do Magick for ourselves and for all of humanity? Let
    us look to see what the Pathways were for others.
     
                                 "The Ancient Druidic Orders"
     
    I have discussed the Ancient orders or levels of Druids in a previous
    workshop.  I include them here for the sake of our current discussion. 
     
    Druidic Bards studied for 15 to 20 years to learn the epics, chants,
    spells and histories of their peoples and clans. These works were
    memorized exactly and were a requirement for advancement to a higher or
    inner level of the Druidic ranks. The works had to be rendered with
    feeling so that the listener would be spell bound and consequently could
    relive the event. The Irish Druids had the following classes of Bards:
     
                                Class          # of Epics
                             __________________________________________ 
                                Driseg         20   (the Beginner)
                                Foclaic        30   (Advanced beginner)
                                Cili           100  (Journeyman)
                                Anraid         175  (Master/Warrior)
                                Ollomh         175+ (Doctor/Judge)
     
    It is to be expected that the lawyers, seers, scientists, judges, and
    clergy of the Draoi underwent similarly lengthy training periods.
     
                          "The Cloak of Many Colors"
     
    In the Christian Bible, Joseph was awarded a cloak of many colors by his
    father because he was beloved among all of his brothers.  Due to the
    jealousy and greed of his brothers, Joseph was also sold into slavery in
    Egypt and suffered a "death" to his old way of life.  Because he was
    open to wisdom and could perceive the meanings within signs and dreams,
    3244

    he became the chief counselor to the Pharaoh and rose above his death to
    "new life". Just as the history of the Gaels is tied to Egypt, so the
    rites of Druids are tied to this idea of "many colors" and rebirth.
    Please recall that the Mileseans descend from the Pharaohs  of Egypt and
    that their Druids were said to be better Magi than the Persians. To be
    as good a Druid as Joseph, one must learn the art of interpreting
    dreams, divination and eloquence. This is a mighty job and worthy of us
    all!
                            "My Own Personal Paths"
     
    When I embarked upon the quest for my roots and for the nature of
    Drai'ocht, I was immediately impressed by two things: 
     
                            1. The Druids were acute and patient observers
                            of Nature.
     
                            2. The Druids were the scholars and scientists
                            of their day.
     
    Using these two ideas, I created a color-coded series of educational
    levels for myself in my quest into the secrets of the Draoi.
     
    I believe there are five areas of knowledge in the Mysteries: 
     
                                    Knowledge of Self, 
                                    Knowledge of the World,
                                    Knowledge of the Spirit, 
                                    Knowledge of Magick, 
                                    Knowledge of the ONE.
     
    The entire process of learning and growing never stops. As a minimum I
    have required myself to know the following:
     
                            Knowledge of Self  (The Blue Level)
                            __________________________________________

    ................................................................................

    The Student must know the Spirit within.  The Student must study the
    Religions of Humanity.  The Student must make a Spiritual Journey.  The
    Student must leave the body and walk the Moon Ways. (OOBE) The Student

    REGRESSION)  The Student must Know the Spirit in Music, Colors, Symbols
    and Life.  The Student must hear the Akasha.
     
                 The Knowledge of Magick (The Orange Level)
                 __________________________________________

                  The Knowledge of the ONE (The Red Level)
                 __________________________________________
     
    The Student must create and lead a Ritual.  The Student must focus the
    three Powers (Earth, Self, ONE).  The Student must perform the Great
    Rite.  The Student must change Reality.  The Student must perform the

    After passing through all levels successfully, the Student then becomes
    the Teacher and can wear the  White, Multi-speckled or the Dark Robes of
    their choice.  This is my path to Drai'ocht. You alone can choose the
    proper path to your Inner Light of Whiteness or Darkness. All colors are
    one color. All Drai'ocht is ONE DRAI'OCHT!
     
                      "The Druidic concepts of Being" 
                       ------------------------------- 
    I would like to quickly touch on some Druidic concepts about states of
    being. These states of being correspond to the previous cosmology that
    we discussed in workshop 5. (Time does not permit me to make a complete
    discussion of these topics tonight. I may add another workshop to cover
    them more completely in the future.)
     
                    "Barddas and The Circles of Being"
                    ---------------------------------- 
    The Welsh Bardic work "Barddas" contains a description of the three
    Circles of Being: 
              1.  Abred or the Realm of Matter
                  (The physical world of form)
     
              2.  Gwynyd or the Realm of Blessedness
                  (The Magickal Astral world of Spirits)
     
               3.  Ceugant or the Realm of Infinities 
                   (That which is the home of the
                    God/desses and the Blessed)
     


    3246

    These states of being are separated by three veils that must be passed:
     
    1.  Annwn or "Dark Forgetfulness"
        (This is the gap or veil that must be passed to achieve birth and
         rebirth in the Physical World.)
     
    2.  Cythraul or "the Ghost"
        (This is the veil that must be passed to achieve enlightenment.)
     
    3.  Lyonesse or "the Isle of the Blest"
         (This is the final veil that is passed when one has achieved
    complete enlightenment and complete growth.)
     
    "Awen" or "illumination" is like a lightning bolt that can come to us
    across these veils and bring us knowledge and understanding.
     
    The key to our Power and true wills is how well we are able to pass
    between these states of being. I will discuss some of these techniques
    next.
     
             "Circles of Thought" or, "The Cyclatron of the Soul"
            
    One of the marvels of modern science is the atom smasher or particle
    accelerator.  Another name for these powerful devices is a "cyclatron".
    This is basically a phased arrray of electromagnetic devices that take
    charged particles and accelerate them to tremendous speeds around a
    circular field until they approximate the speed of light or at least
    they approach relativistic velocities. The particles are then smashed
    into a target and the history of the mutual destruction is observed and
    recorded so that humanity may unlock the secrets of the Gods. I trust
    that most of us here tonight have experienced this acceleration effect
    within the vortex of our thoughts and Spirits. We strive mightily to
    increase the relativistic mass of our thoughts so that we may observe
    their behavor as they approach God-like reality in their manifestions.
    Whirr and strive as we might, we are doomed to the universal restraints
    of our own humanity in much the same manner as nuclear physicists are
    limited by the unvirsal limits of "C" or light speeds (warp Factor 1,
    Mr. Sulu!<G>). Such are the limits of thinking.
     
                   "The Salmon Leap and the Shaman's Death"
            
    I have gone through the process of questing for ultimate meaning in life
    many times. Most of this effort has been exhausting as well as futile.
    Only through extraordinary efforts have I actually attained results.
    These results came about through quantum leaps of the mind and spirit
    across the "void". Since the salmon is the totem of knowledge, I call
    this leap the "Salmon Leap". It is very approprite to name it thus since
    the "void" is actually "death" and the salmon "leap" up the streams of
    it's birth to spawn new life from it's own death struggle. The ancients
    also refered to mighty feats as a "Salmon Leap". We must experience the
    "Shaman's Death" in order to attain our new life and knowledge. The
    "Salmon Leap" brings us to a New Reality and altered state of Being.
    Included in the initiation rites to all of the Great Mystery Schools was
    just such a rite of Death and Rebirth. Anyone care to reveal their
    secrets now?<G> OTO'ers? GD'ers? Druids? Wiccans? AMORC?  Freemasons?
    Templars? Illumatti? Assassins? Channellers? Others? The floor is now
    open. Let's hear the words of Life and the words of Death. Josey Wales
    faces Ten Bears in the moment of Truth. The gauge is cast...the 
    3247

    challenge is issued. The floor is open to all comers!
     
                                "Enlightenment"
     
    Coming through the "dark night of the soul" or the "Shaman's Death"
    purifies and releases us so that we can experience illumination and
    enlightenment. Our "darkness' and ignorance are burned away in the
    flames of the Phoenix as we are reborn into the Light! Such a wonder!
    The Akasha and all knowledge are there to be received! Our training and
    our quest are rewarded. We are a new creation!
     
                              "The Dragon's Eye"
     
    The "Dragon's Eye" is another word for Earth Magick or the Power
    inherent to the Land that is at the root of the Celtic Soul. This is the
    power of Excalibur or Caliborn, the sword of Arthur. It is the "Dragon's
    Breath" that Merlin works with to create a Magickal Mist while using the
    charm of "Making". We have already seen the "Eye of the Dragon" in a
    previous workshop ritual. I would like to now open the floor for a
    further discussion by everyone here as to how we sense this Power in the
    Land and particularly how we sense it at many sacred sites such as
    "Stone Circles", Raths, Menhirs, Hills, "Ley Lines", "Stonehenge",
    "Avebury" or any other site of your experience. The floor is now open
    for Magickal discussion!

    Anyone else have a good story for how they've sensed the Power of the
    Land? How it just is laying there waiting for the call?

    (2-10,Freepowder)       Some time, when you can be alone for a while..
    climb up into the moutains, my mountains are the Sierras get up high,
    above treeline, and sit there, find a rock... where the wind blows all
    the time and just sit. it may take a while maybe an hour, maybe a day...
    but you will feel it.. strength more than power, but power just the same
    coming up form the rocks... singing in the wind... when you have got it
    right.. the animals will come you may not see them, the conys and the
    birds but you will feel them too if you are lucky.  they will talk to
    you not in words but in thoughts.  if you are ready your totem will make
    itself known I have found that no great preparation is neccesary but for
    an open heart and mind it happens for me everytime I go there which is
    not nearly often enough oh! don't do this in a lightning storm <G>

    (2-8,O'Dubhain)         Beautiful Freepowder! A hymn to the Mother!
    We can all sing the song of the Health of the Earth!  She is beautiful
    still in some places and will be again in others as we....and I do mean
    we.... all get together to release the Power of the Dragon!  THAT has
    been safeguarded for us by our ancient Shamans within the Earth. I sense
    that the keys for this Work are soon to be given to us all once more.

    (2-15,Nan)              Well, I can think of many times that I've felt
    the Power of the Land but I'll offer just a simple recent example:
    Last week I gave my ankle a nasty sprain, I knew that one thing it
    needed for healing was to walk barefoot on the land, so that's what I
    did <g> in general I find that going barefoot on almost any ground
    allows me to feel the power of the land......I don't do it long in the
    snow though <g>.

    (2-8,O'Dubhain)         I'll bet!!!<G>  Many of the ancient sacred sites
    are no longer in active use. I think that the day is rapidly approaching
    3248

    where the Land will call us to Work Magicks at such sites. We will
    re-establish the "ley lines" of Power that are now just echoes of their
    past. These lines and sites require a Human/Dragon magickal connection
    to re-Power the grids that exist all across this planet. Many events 
    occur today that point to this Work.

    (2-15,Nan)              I just wanted to comment that a few years ago I
    visited a more obscure stone circle and noticed by items left behind
    that it had been recently used..... so not *all* the ancient sites are
    inactive and I'm glad!

    (2-8,O'Dubhain)         That's true! I believe Shadow Hawk told about
    feeling serpent lines of Power beneath Avebury's Circles during a visit
    there as well, though Stonehenge seemed inert. He told me recently that
    he sensed that it could come "alive" again for the right combination of
    persons working there. If that happened, it would have to be tended on
    a regular basis. Too much of the Dragon sleeps at that site.  Myrdin
    Emyrs sleeps nearby himself!  Anyone else have a "Dragon" sense?

    (2-17,cherokee/wwc1)    Many of the american indians have the same
    legends only we call it the serpent my great grandmother taught me to go
    out at night and to feel  the serpent move beneath my feet and to listen
    to the song it made in the wind.  We believe the time for the serpent to
    rise is here [it is in the] spirit of the people and the land.  I have
    been a healer in my past lives we used the crystals to awaken the
    serpent when it was time.  That time is soon and I feel the serpent
    singing to me.

    (2-8,O'Dubhain)         Thank you My Princess!<G>  Some legends say that
    crystals were used at Stonehenge as well. They were placed upon the tops
    of the lentils there to provide a Power connection.  Perhaps the crystal
    skulls will provide an answer.  I hope to see one in Miami next month.

    (2-15,Nan)              All this talk of serpents reminded me of
    Australia, where the Aborigines have the story of the rainbow serpent (I
    think it may be part of a creation myth) there they call the ley lines
    songlines. Bruce Chatwin wrote a wonderful book by that name that covers
    a lot about the Aborginal beliefs

    (2-8,O'Dubhain)         I want to check into that some more. Isn't it
    also amazing that everyone connects the serpent to wisdom ....even the
    Christians do it!<G> Though I must say they try to make out like it was
    a bad thing to get smart!<G>

    (2-17,cherokee/wwc1)    All peoples have stories of serpents many of
    them have head cult legends where the skulls were used as resonators to
    focus energy and to sing to the serpent to wake it up the aborigines
    believe this as did the mayans and the cherokees and other native
    peoples

              "The Many Speckled Rainment" "The Song of Amergin"
            
    This translation by Dr. Douglas Hyde from his work "Literary History of
    Ireland" was as well known to the Druids as the "Lord's Prayer" is to
    todays priests. It is a perfect example of the many different Magickal
    skills used by the Druids. It is one of my personal favorites as
    well!<G> I would like to use it to discuss the "many-speckled" rainbow
    of Drai'ocht! Once again I give you the words of the Bard:
     
                                         The Mystery
     
                            I am the wind which breathes upon the sea.
                            I am the wave of the ocean.
                            I am the murmur of the billows.
                            I am the ox of the seven combats.
                            I am the vulture upon the

                            I am the fairest of plants.
                            I am a wild boar in valour.
                            I am a salmon in the water.
                            I am a lake in the plain.
                            I am a word of science.
                            I am a point of the lance in battle.
                            I am the God who created in the head the fire.
                            Who is it who throws light into the meeting 
                            on the mountain?
                            Who announces the ages of the Moon?
                            Who teaches the place where couches the Sun?

    3250
                   
    I could write an entire page on each of these attributes but not
    tonight!<G> "Fire in the Head" is the name of an excellent book by Tom
    Cowan on the subject of Celtic Shamanism.  "The 21 Lessons of Merlin" by
    Douglas Monroe agrees with my assignments for most of the above colors. 
    A true Druid worn the Cloak of many Colors for festive occassions, White
    or Black robes to conduct Magick and during ritual and a bull's hide
    when in battle.
     
                                  "Authority"
     
    This the source or result of working with Magick for Druids. It is a
    measure of their Power and the strength of their "True Wills".  In the
    "21 Lessons" Monroe states that the students of Drai'ocht were awarded
    colored glass beads (called Gleini na Droedh) that were strung on
    leather cords for necklaces. These multicolored necklaces were kept
    secret by each Druid and produced only to demonstrate their Authority to
    other Druids. Magick knowledge, discipline and practice determined the
    level of Authority thus attained.
     
                               "Into the Light"
            
    Fionn's Wheel can also be multicolored.  I have made the one in the
    library that way!<G> (Make it so Number One!<G>) Seriously, to become a
    Master Druid, one must transcend the separation of colors and walk into
    the Light. This involves knowing the many fold paths of the Wheel and
    primarily the Inner Mystery of the relationship of Life and Death, White
    and Black, Balance and Action, Being and Not being. The Initiations into
    most of the Great Mysteries included this Dualism of Transcendancy. (An
    excellent  book on this topic is "The Great Initiates"by Edouard Schure,
    translation by Gloria Rasberry.)
     
                            What does this mean? 
                            What is this Initiation?
                            What is the Mystery?
     
     
    What follows is what I envision COULD have happened during such an
    initiation.  Hear the words a modern day Druid  might hear as he
    achieves his full Knowledge:
     
    <the Initiate will have been fasting and meditating within the total
    darkness of a cave or a dark room for at least a night.  Just before the
    rising of the sun or the lighting of the fires he/she would hear a loud
    female voice cry out!>
     
         "I am Arianrhod, Queen of the Heavens!  You who approach me must
         now ask yourselves these questions: 
                   How can you achieve the Inner Knowledge? 
              Where can you find the Signs that show you the Way? 
              Heed My Words! 
              I am Arianrhod, Queen of the Stars, 
              I am She of the Silver Wheel! 
              My crown spreads across the Vault of the Heavens! 
              Your dreams shall be filled with the Secret Ways of the Night! 
             It is I that will show you the Paths of Knowledge! 
              It is I that will fire your Spirit in sparkling crystals of
                   Wonder! 
              I am Arianrhod! Come to Me My children!  
    3251

              Be filled with Expectancy for what is yet to come!"
     
    <The chief Druid could follow these words with the following caution.>
     
              "Hear the Words of the Ard Druis:"
              "You who seek the Ways of Power must dare to approach the
                   Queen of the Stars! 
              You who seek the embrace of Wisdom must approach Her Presence
                   without fear! 
              You that seek for Love must first know your True Selves. What 
             is your Authority?
              Are you truly Human? Speak now if you dare!"
     
    <Then the Initiates should ask for entry to the Inner Mysteries.>
     
                            "Oh Arianrhod of the Silver Wheel! 
                            Bless us in Your Mysteries! 
                            Fill us with Your Spirit! 
                            Let us place no limits upon Your exalted Being! 
                            You are Infinite! 
                            You are the Unknown! The Darkness!
                            Admit us into Thy arms!
                            Grant us Your Blessings!
                            Our speech is confounded! 
                            Chaos is upon us!"
     
    <Once again, the Ard Druis would charge the Initiates.>
     
                            "Now is the Great Re-awakening! 
                            Now is the time of enlightenment! 
                            Those who are untrue shall be cast out 
                            into the depths! 
                            Cleanse yourselves through trials of fire 
                            and fasting! The way is long, 
                            Only the strong shall attain Knowledge!"
     
    <A flame or beam of sunlight should be produced to shine upon an open
    doorway, admitting the Initiates into the Inner Sanctum.>
     
                            "Behold the Flaming Door!
                            Behold the Burning sword of Gorias!
                            Enter if you dare the halls of Lugh!!
                            Wear the many speckled cloak of Samildanach!"
                            "Hear the words of the Sun!"
     
    <A male Druid dressed in Robes of Gold and bearing a torch should
    address the Initiates.>
     
         "I am Lugh Lamfadagh!!! I am Samildanach!
         I am thy burning desire for Knowledge! 
         I am the Power that illumes the Heavens! 
         Life is my gift to you, even as your Death is the Mother of Life. 
         To know Me is to know yourself completely, even beyond Death!
         Enter if you dare!

    and presented with a golden sickle and a staff fashioned from the wood
    of the tree that is his "soul tone".  Standing before the gathered
    assembly,He should recite his geneology and the many achievements of his
    necklace of Gleini na Droedh. The ceremony should then be completed by
    the conducting of the Initiate's personal ritual (from his work on the
    Red Level).>
     
                            Such is the end of a long journey.

    Celtic Workshop #13 - The "Charm of Making" 

    This Workshop was presented and hosted by Searles O'Dubhain. We covered
    some concepts touching upon the beginings of all things. We also covered
    how symbols are used to describe reality and Magick. We discussed the
    necessity for *belief* in performing Magick. I led a discussion about a
    ritual that was centered around the Charm of "Making". The arch[e]types
    and the Quarters used in Celtic Magickal systems were also discussed.
    Some preliminary socializing soon gave way to the formal presentation
    and discussion:

                                Opening Remarks
     
    Tonight I attempt to tie together the beliefs of the Celts in Cos-
    mologies and Magick or Drai'ocht to what we know of the world and
    reality through the study of modern science and more recent Magickal
    systems and their resulting Cosmological models. It is my hope that all
    of this discussion will clarify the history of the Celts and the
    workings of the Druids. The highest form of Drai'ocht was the Charm of
    "Making". This is the essence of creation by the use of the Will.  It is
    into the Cauldron of Primodial Creation that I plunge tonight as a
    Midwife to Magick.  Drai'ocht shall live again! The Dragon will once
    again be reborn!
     
                                    "Chaos"
     
    In many mythologies and some philosophies, Chaos is the void that
    existed in the begining of all things before even time existed and from 
    which all things have arisen. 
     
    "The notion that creation came from nothing (creatio ex nihilo) appears
    in several accounts of creation. The biblical story of creation
    contained in the Book of GENESIS begins with a formless, watery chaos
    that God shapes into the ordered world. The hymn of creation from
    India's epic Rig Veda (see VEDAS) describes the primordial situation as
    one of neither existence nor nonexistence and further states that no
    one, not even the gods, knows who produced the universe. In marked
    contrast is an Egyptian myth attributing creation to the deity khepri.
    In this myth Khepri states that when he came into being, being itself
    3253

    came into being; all other beings were then produced from his actions
    and his body; but before him there was only nonbeing. Among the
    Polynesians, creation myths emphasize the dimensions of void space and
    the qualities of darkness as the primordial structures of creation. In
    these myths, the initial state of darkness and void in which the deity
    dwells is later transformed and the forms of the universe then emerge.
    Creation is thus predicated on a void or a nothingness--a reality
    totally different from any form or substance of the created order. In
    addition, the deities who create from nothing or emerge from this void
    are given a new and special kind of power; for though creators of the
    world, they remain distinct from it in their originative form."
    .......quoted from The Online Edition of GROLIER'S ACADEMIC AMERICAN
    Encyclopedia, Copyright (c) 1993, Grolier Electronic Publishing.
     
    Magick is the ability to cross the void of Chaos and to create order in
    the universe that surrounds us. The primary way in which this creation
    occurs is through the focus of our own Wills.
     
                          "The Void was without Form"
            
    "Chaos theory, a modern development in mathematics and science, provides
    a framework for understanding irregular or erratic fluctuations in
    nature. Chaotic systems are found in many fields of science  and
    engineering. The study of their dynamics is an essential part of the
    burgeoning science of complexity--the effort to understand the prin-
    ciples of order that underlie the patterns of all real systems, from
    ecosystems to social systems to the universe as a whole." ..quoted from

    The BIG BANG theory of the creation of the universe is widely accepted
    by astronomers.  "It holds that the universe began with the explosive
    expansion of a single, extremely condensed state of matter. A further
    development of this model, known as INFLATIONARY THEORY, describes the
    original condensed matter as arising from virtually empty space. Whether
    the universe will expand forever, slow to a halt, or contract again and
    continue to oscillate indefinitely from one big bang to the next is the
    subject of ongoing speculation....." Charles Long .......quoted from The
    Online Edition of GROLIER'S ACADEMIC AMERICAN Encyclopedia, Copyright
    (c) 1993, Grolier Electronic Publishing.
     
     
                                    "Order"
     
    Out of Nothingness was Reality formed. The diversity of Reality is due
    to the two great forces of separation: projection and reception (the
    male and the femine aspects of Power).  From this duality of all things,
    the rest of Creation is manifested. This manifestation can be described
    and modeled in many ways. I have chosen to limit myself briefly to two
    such descriptions during tonight's workshop. The first such model or
    description is the science of "quantum mechanics". According to this
    area of science, everything is composed of waves and the interaction
    between wavefronts. With two primary and distinctly different sources of
    waveforms, we get interference patterns. These lines of intersection
    have their own "nature" and give rise to other "quantum effects" in
    their own localized area of the space/time continuum. This ongoing
    process of interaction and manifestation can create Infinite Combination
    in Infinite Diversity (IDIC). I will discuss this concept later.
    3254
     
    The other way in which two differing states can create their own
    "reality" is through the laws of Boolean Logic and Algebra. In digital
    design and simulation techniques, this fact is well known. I work in
    such areas and can reduce any system to a series of "min" and "max"
    terms of inputs and "truth tables". This Boolean discipline of using
    "min and max terms" has given birth to the CyberSpace that we currently
    inhabit. I suggest that our present existence is no more than a
    "real-time" simulation in a greater system and that our creative/destru-
    ctive interactions are constantly birthing new realities and new
    creations. We are each a "star" as some Magickal systems teach. 
     
    All Physical and Magickal systems have hidden controls that operate from
    outside the program flow (another word for this flow might be called
    "life"). This outside intervention might be what appears in the form of
    "Magick" to an internal observer of that system. The operating system
    for the host platform, such as DOS, determines the form of the relation-
    ships between all programs, files and other processes. A magickal way of
    stating this might be, "As Above, So Below".  Tonight, I have discussed
    only two ways that some realities are postulated and created. In the
    wide variety of the Infinite Cosmos, Diversity is carried to the
    extremes. Anything CAN and DOES happen!
     
                                   "Symbols"
     
    One way man has attempted to understand and quantify his universe is
    through the use of symbols. The most often used symbols are numbers,
    letters and sigils. The Jewish Kabbala, the Celtic Oghams and the other
    Magickal alphabets are good examples of the use of such symbols to order
    and understand most physical, spiritual and Magickal relationships. I
    have talked about Oghams and Fionn's Wheel/Ladder in previous workshops.
    I have also talked about the Celtic Cosmology. Tonight I will briefly
    touch on numbers and math. Please refer to the previous Celtic Workshops
    #1, 2, 3, 5 and the Online Wicca Kabbala Threads for more information in
    those areas. Another kind of symbol that can describe our reality is a
    relatively new form of mathematics called Fractals.
     
                                  "Fractals"
     
    "A modern mathematical theory that radically departs from traditional
    EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY, fractal geometry describes objects that are
    self-similar, or scale symmetric.  This means that when such objects are
    magnified, their parts are seen to bear an exact resemblance to the
    whole, the likeness continuing with the parts of the parts and so on to
    infinity.  Fractals, as these shapes are called, also must be devoid of
    translational symmetry--that is, the smoothness associated with
    Euclidean lines, planes, and spheres.  Instead a rough, jagged quality
    is maintained at every scale at which an object can be examined.  The
    nature of fractals is reflected in the word itself, coined by mathe-
    matician Benoit B. Mandelbrot from the Latin verb frangere, "to break," 
    and the related adjective fractus, "irregular and fragmented."
     
    The science of fractals has been found to exist within many natural
    formations . Fractals are found everywhere we look, from the shape of 
    coastlines to the geometry found in cellular divisions. Most dynamical
    systems that change their behavior over time become CHAOTIC in nature
    and can also be described using fractals.  The reason I mention fractals
    tonight is twofold. First, fractals show us mathematically how reality
    and life are manifested. As I said earlier, fractal geometry and 
    3255

    mathematics are a fairly recent discovery. One important type of Fractal
    that is found in nature is called a Mandelbrot set. This particular set
    of fractals becomes inheritly unstable as one looks closer at it's
    component fractals. What is so interesting about this fact and study is
    that FRACTALS in the FORM OF MANDELBROT SETS have been appearing as CROP
    CIRCLES on the Salisbury Plains. This is the same area that is located
    close by both Stonehenge and Avebury.  What is the source of these
    symbols? Where is this information coming from? Are these crop circles
    some sort of Magickal alphabet or symbols? Are they communicated to us
    across time and space from other Magicians or other Entities? If they
    are such symbols, has this phenomena occurred before in the past? Did
    the Druids observe, record and understand this type of information
    during their times? 
     
    My second pointis that our knowledge of Magick is itself like a fractal.
    With each piece of information we receive from our searches into the
    nature of Magick, we discover more and more questions. This gives rise
    to more and more associations and consequently more questions and
    disorder. Our attempts to totally understand Magick by close inspection 
    consequently results in chaotic thinking.  We see fractals everywhere
    when we look at the world. This world seems to be a fractal.  Everything
    from shorelines, earthquakes, cell structure to computer graphics have
    been found to obey the laws of fractals. Perhaps Magick and the heavenly
    cosmologies are fractals of the Higher Will? Perhaps our True Will is a
    fractal? Maybe fractals are the new Ogham, the new Wheel of Fionn?
            
                               "Transformations"
     
    If an idea can be reduced to mathematical or Magickal symbols, then it
    can also be manipulated or transformed. These relation-ships are called
    "veils" or "pathworkings" in Magickal works. In mathematics, such
    transformations occur frequently. What is complex in one domain is
    simple in another.  Engineers use such techniques as vector and
    tensor analysis to handle complex systems all the time. Magicians use
    the principle, "As Above , So Below" to aid their Magickal Workings.
    Sometimes this Magickal work is also done while using symbollic logic to
    aid in the act of manifesting or "making" a new creation. We will next
    discuss how some of these Magickal transformations are done.
            
                              "Vibratory States"
     
    The addition of external energy to a molecule or the introduction of
    additional molecules into a solution causes its electron configuartion
    to change. The electron "jumps" across an energy barrier to obtain a
    different orbit or geometry.  The Molecule changes its behavior,
    sometimes with amazing results. This change in electrons through levels
    or states of energy is directly analogous to the levels or states of
    vibration that a Magician goes through to "resonate" with other
    spiritual forces. These principles of resonance and vibration are the
    keys to the techniques of OOBE and energy transfer in Magickal systems.
    To discover how we as Magickal/Spiritual entities can go through these
    types of transformed states, I looked at my own experiences, once again.
     
                            "Personal Experiences"
     
    The keys to working Magick are BELIEF, DISCIPLINE and FOCUS. Focus is a
    matter of personal ability and is sharpened through practice and effort. 
    Discipline is inherit to our very natures. Belief is absolutely 
    3256

    necessary to any Magickal Work. I have had three types of personal
    experiences that are the foundation of my BELIEF in MAGICK.
     
                            "The All from the None"
     
    This experience I have discussed before. It is the first veil that must
    be passed to obtain BELIEF in Magick and the resulting Powers. Briefly
    stated, I was able to detach from the ordinary (while conscious) and
    encounter Spirit and Magickal Beings.  These experiences have reinforced
    my ability to work Astrally and Magickally. The secrets to this
    experience are meditation, inner quietness and the increased vibrational
    level of the spirit or "ecstasy".
     
    By going into the "void" of Nothingness, I was touched by the Power of
    the Akasha! Anyone can do this, if they are willing to put in the time
    and effort to meditate to achieve inner "quietness".  The "Void" is the
    place where the Will can focus to create and produce all Magick!
     
                            "The None From the All"
     
    These are experiences I have had from "lucid dreaming". I have basically
    been able to go anywhere and do anything in my dreams. I have had many
    revelations and Super Normal experiences in these dreams. I guess the
    most outrageous experience was experiencing "death". Some deaths were
    just an abrupt end to one existence while manifesting into another body
    and another existence. One particular "death" was at the center of an
    exploding sun or bomb. I was literally blown into Nothingness and
    Non-Existence. I "floated" there in endless time without thought or
    being. I just was.  Only my Will still existed and through the exertion
    of my Will I was able to awaken into my body once more. This was not and
    ordinary dream. In fact, I'm not really sure this is the Reality I
    started out in! <GGG>  A Powerful incentive to learn more about Magick
    (to prevent such a thing from ever happening again)!!!!!
     
                                    "IDIC"
     
    IDIC is borrowed from the Vulcan, Mr. Spock. It stands for Infinite
    Diversity in Infinite Combinations. This basically means the Universe
    is filled with possibilities and that anything can (and will) happen.
    This is all those strange events that can be dismissed if taken one at
    a time but will stagger you if you keep a log of them. This includes
    such things in my life as:  Flying or "floating" in the air by myself, 
    reading minds, seeing the future, seeing creatures that are in another
    plane, hearing the music of the Sidhe and incredible feats of strength
    and speed (that could not possible have happened). All these many events
    taken together point to a variety of techniques that people can do. The
    secret is in remembering how we did it!!! Or maybe in finding a really
    excellent teacher. I am the worst of students but I am very persis-
    tent!<GGG>
     
                             "The Charm of Making"
     
    The following is the merest sketch of an outline for performming the
    Charm of Making, the very same chant that Merlin was heard to use in the
    movie "Excalibur". Much of this ritual comes from the following works:
    "The 21 Lessons of Merlin", "Celtic Magic', "Witta", "The Irish Celtic
    Magical Tradition" and the "Sacred Cauldon". Some of it is changed to
    suit my personal (*Irish*) preferences!<G>
    3257
     
                            "Circles of Drai'ocht "
     
    Druids' Circles are very similar to other Magickal Circles. Each
    direction should have a candle and color associated with it.  (I use Red
    for East, White for South, Grey or Blue for West and Black for North).
    I also have candles for the God and the Goddess.  these are usually
    Green and Red respectively.  I light the candles as the Spirits are
    invoked.
     
                                "The Guardians"

                                 "The Words of Power"
     
    After the Guardians have been called, then the Words of Power Are Spoken
    and the Rite or Sign of Three Rays is performed for each of the
    Quarters.
     
                                            "IAO"
     
    This is the name of the God/dess of All and is intoned three times while
    making the appropriate hand gestures,
     
                                    "EEEEE-Ahhhhhh-OOOOO".
                                    "EEEEE-Ahhhhhh-OOOOO".

                                    "Threshold Experiences"
     
    If a portal to another plane or place is to be opened then the following
    Charm of Making is to be said three times (this Charm uses the Power of
    Sea and Stone):
     
                                  "A ELFNTODD DWYR SINDDYN DUW
                                   CERRIG YR FFERLLURUG NWYN;

                                   FEWR ECHLYN MOR, NECROMBOR LLUN"
     
                                                       "Dragon's Breath"
     
    If something is to be caused to happen or prevented then the following
    Charm of Making is intoned three times (this charm invokes the Powers of
    Fire and Air):
     
                                        "ANAIL NATHROCK
                                         UTHVASS BETHUDD
                                         DOCHIEL DIENVE"
     
    At this point the Power has been raised. The Will of the Draoi' should
    be directed and stated forcefully in the direction of greatest Power
    using the sign for that Quarter. Once the work, is completed, the
    God/desses and Guardians should be thanked and the Power Earthed by 
    lowering both hands to the ground while kneeling.  The Circle is opened
    in the reverse of its creation and the bounty of the Land and Tuatha
    should be enjoined and enjoyed by all.
     
    This is the end of the prepared presentation on the Charm of "Making".
    This and "Pathworking" are the two most powerful abilities of a Druid.

           Celtic Workshop #14 - "The Wheel of Elements or Seasons"

    Forum member Freepowder noted similarities between the Plains Indian
    Medicine Wheels and Fionn's Wheel from Celtics sources. His analysis and
    presentation on these topics led into a discussion of other cross 
    3261

    cultural similarities. I added some info from a study of the indigenous
    peoples of the world as well as Celtic topics. 

    Tonight our man of many names, Freepowder, O'Ba'n,John White, Sir Freep,
    etc. will give us his thoughts on the wheel and the directions as
    compared between the Plains Indians and the Celts.  It looks to be
    good!<GGG> I may have a few comments of my own. I also have some info on
    thses directions compiled by a noted anthropologist, Angeles Arriens,
    for the indiginous peoples of the world. I hope we can discuss the use
    and meanings of directions to all of us in our magical work.
     
                                        "The Wheel of Elements or Seasons"
     
    The world over, aboriginal religions have used the circle as a symbol of
    the world, the cosmos and the spirit.  Tonite I will attempt to draw
    some parallels between the Celtic version, Fionn's wheel or window and
    the Plains Indian version, the Medicine wheel.  Both of these wheels are
    pictured as a circle bisected by two lines, one vertical and one
    horizontal. In Plains Indian (PI from here on) the circle represents the
    cycles of the earth, of learning and of life. 
     
    The lines represent the 'roads' one must travel to achieve enlighten-
    ment.  The points at which the lines intersect the circle signify the
    four directions, east to the right, south at the bottom, west to the
    left, and north at the top.  There are qualities and totems (animal
    spirit guides) assigned to each direction. The totems and qualities
    vary somewhat, tribe to tribe, and the following is an attempt to
    combine several, mostly Lakota (Sioux) and Tsisistis (Cheyenne)   .
     
                                        East: 
    red, illunination, child, the sun, spring, the source of life, 
    eagle, hawk and birds generally

                            South: 
    yellow, innocence, youth, daylight, summer, fullness of life, snake,
    lizard, mouse, horse, elk

                            West: 
    black or blue, introspection, maturity, sunset, autumn, waning of life,
    thunder beings, Bear, buffalo

                            North: 
    white, wisdom, old age, night, winter, death, wolf, raven, buffalo
     
    The PI speak of the guardians of the quarters as 'Grandfathers' or
    'Grandmothers'. Animals in mundane life are refered to as 'Little
    Brother or Sister.' At the center of the wheel is,in Lakota, 'Wakan
    Tanka', the Great Mystery. The source of all life, of all that is.
    Although Wakan Tanka is refered to as Grandfather, it has no sex, no
    body, it is at once the creator and all of creation. Also at the center
    is White Buffalo woman (or Sweet Medicine to the Cheyenne), the
    personification of the earth, and the female aspect of Wakan Tanka.
     
    The cycle of life as illustrated by the Medicine Wheel starts at the
    east. The PI believe that as an infant a person knows all things, thus
    the connection with enlightenment. As you grow into youth these things
    are forgotten so you may learn, and grow, symbolised by the south and
    innocence. When you are mature you move to the west and introspection.

    Here you take your vision quest. As you approach old age you achieve
    wisdom in the north and, if you survive you return to the enlightenment
    of the east.
                            On to the Celts!
     
    The Celts use either a four spoked wheel, identical to the medicine
    wheel in apearance or enhance the image with 'cross quarters' making an
    eight spoked wheel. One differnce in the Celtic version of the Wheel, is
    probaly due to the variation in weather patterns between the Britsh
    Isles and the Great Plains. The Britsh Isles are around 1000 miles north
    of the Plains causing several things to happen. The sun, even at
    midsummer will rise far further to the north in Britain. Britain's
    proximity to the trade winds cause the prevailing winds to come from
    differnt directions. Therefore the Celts start their journey of life in
    the north.  The qualities of the quarters areremarkably similar if
    somewhat skewed as to direction. (Note: the animals assigned to quarters
    and cross quarters are approximate and individual impressions as to what
    animal goes where are most important IMHO)   
     
                                        They are:
     
                            North: 
    black, winter, wisdom, clarity, death, earth, animals, minerals,
    fallowness, darkness, winter solstice, salmon, wolf, the Morrigan, 

                            East: 
    red, spring, inspiration, life, birth, renewal, air, birds, smell,
    dryness, germination, spring equinox, otter, crow

                            South: 
    white, summer, spirit, humanity, change, power, fire, sun, light,
    vegatables, summer solstice, bear, hawk,

                            West:  
    grey, autumn, creativity, ripeness, fertility, compassion, love,
    emotions, hearing, water, moon, twilight, fish, autumn equinox, stag,
    hound
     
    The cross quarters mark the seasonal festivals, have associated animals
    and are used to represent the ages of mankind:
            
                                    Imbolc: 31 Jan, child, eagle
                                    Beltaine: 30 Apr, youth, sow
                                    Lughnasadh: 31 Jul, adult, horse
                                    Samhain: 31 Oct, elder, heron
     
    The Celts assign Gods and Goddesses to the quarters as well. The
    following courtesy of O'Dubh, and subject to interpretation. God/esses
    are directional <G> as follows:
     
                            North: 
    Master Morfessa of Falias, The Morrighan, Goibhniu, The Dagdha, Epona,
    Eriu, Macha (The Land, the Lia Fal, Magick, Soveriegnty)   

                            East: 
    Master Uscias of Findias Danu, Anu, Lir, Lugh, Bridget, Scathach, Ogma,
    Nuada (The Invincible Sword, Wisdom, Strength, the Winds)   
                            South: 
    3263

    Master Esras from Gorias The Dagdha, Lugh, Bridget, Danu (The Flaming
    Spear, Action, Fire, the Sun or Shining One)   

                            West: 
    Master Semias from Murias, Manannan mac Lir, The Dagdha, The Cailleach,
    Cerridwen, Danu, Dianecht, Arianrhod (Rebirth, the Undry, the Sacred
    Cauldron, the Sea, Water)   
     
    Many of these God/desses are assigned to more than one direction because
    they have more than one aspect (The Dagdha, Danu, Bridget, Lugh, the
    Morrighan). The best way to associate them with a particular direction
    is to base their direction upon their role in your Working or upon their
    use of the magickal tool involved.
     
    The Celts have this multi-faceted diversity in the nature and directions
    of their God/desses due to their travels across Europe and their
    incorporation of the local Deities into the Deities of their respective
    clans.  When they finally stopped their travels, these Deities were then
    more fixed in their associated directions and attributes. As modern day
    Celts, we have the use of all of these Archetypes to aid or worship and
    to enrich our Magicks!

    (2-21,cherokee)         the cherokee say that all ancient cultures
    descend through the plieades and that the druids and the cherokee have
    origins in atlantis the cherokee calendar as are most medicine wheels
    are based on the mayan system of time.  The Dogon of W. Africa say the
    same.  which is very similar to the celtic most ancient cultures say
    they got the wheel from the stars

    Also some of the first sailors to come in contact with North American
    Indians were Welsh and they could converse with some of the tribes!
    Seemed the Indians were speaking Welsh!<G>

    (2-21,cherokee)         the cherokee also claim twelve tribes came out
    of atlantis when it was destroyed and populated the areas of the earth
    bringing this ancient wisdom to other cultures like the 12 tribes of
    israel there are 12 clans in the cherokee matrilieage.  There was
    contact betwweeen the nordic vikings and the indians after contact with
    the celts too.

    (2-9,M&J)               As to the NA Indians speaking Welsh, I attended
    a Celtic League symposium a year or two back, and this was one of the
    talks.  I'll have to go back and review my notes, but as I recall this
    is heavily debated.  The accounts go back to a Welsh prince who
    supposedly sailed to America.  Whether or not this is true is highly
    uncertain.

    (2-8,Freepowder)        The Welsh Prince was Madoc, and I believe...
    he was supposed to have sailed in the 11th century.... there were
    records of his sailing away.... but nothing on where he ended up....he
    most certainly never returned to wales.... One possible explanation for
    the 'Welsh' Indians is the occurance of grey eyes in some of the
    southern tribes, notably... the Choctaw and Cherokee.... There are some
    similarities in the languages, but it is possible.. that this is due to
    some wandering Celt .... heading east from the orient. <G>

    Ok Thanks FP!<G>  There are many other similarities...notably the common
    belief among both sets of peoples, the Cherokees and the Celts, that
    3264

    springs were doorways to the Underworlds and possessed their own
    spirits. There are other similarities... The Irish have legends about
    the first settlers coming from the west after a flood.

     This was later Christianized to be the daughter of Noah Ceasir....but
    it was first thought to be Atlantis. Also some of the alignments of the
    stone circles are on the Pleides.  In fact, The two major hubs of the
    Celtic year are connected to when the Pleides first ascend into the
    constellation of Taurus That is when Bealtaine and Samhain actually
    occur.
     
    As to use in your magickal workings, given the eclectic nature of most
    American Mages, introduction of the Plains Indian version of the
    attributes of the quarters is allowable. Perhaps even justified given
    our geographical location. I personally use the Indian colors and
    animals in conjunction with the Celtic God/esses. As they used to say in
    the Toyota comercials, 'It just feels right.' <G>

    Ok I have another set of values for directions.  Then a brief discussion
    of future topics.  I know everyone is suffering from too much Holiday!!-
    !<GGG>
