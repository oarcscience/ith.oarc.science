          ** MAGICK 8 -- HEALING AND BANISHING ** 

           

                          Psychic or spiritual healingis a human potentialwe all

          possess.  Some people  are  especially good  at this.  It  is probably

          easier to heal someone else by occult means than yourself. In addition

          to healing in the presence of the person, there is 'absent healing' in

          which the healing 

          occurs  at a  distance.  Note that  there are  some who  maintain that

          influence on another person without his specific knowledge and permis-

          sion (yes, even  in healing and helping) is black  magick. (After all,

          everybody is living according to his own true will, so that healing or

          helping someone without permission is affecting  his will). This means

          it is important to tell the person  what you are planning to do and to

          ask his permission. The theory of psychic healing is that sickness  is

          characterized (although  not necessarily  caused) by a  deficiency and

          imbalance of vital  energy. Psychic healing transfers  energy from the

          healer to the  sick to repair and rebalance his  energies. If an inept

          healer overdoes the  process, or if he doesn't take  the precaution to

          'disconnect' himself afterwards, he may find himself 


                                           1348

          becoming  sick due  to  energy drain  and a  linkage  to his  subject.

          Similarly, the healer should always be in a good state of health or he

          could unintentionally transfer his illness to the subject.  












































                                           1349

                          Thebasicmethods ofpsychichealingare: 1)creativevisual-

          ization, 2) prayer,  3) ritual. Creative visualization  is one of  the

          easiest techniques. Mild illness may  yield to only one or  two treat-

          ments; serious  ills will require  many treatments over  time. Psychic

          healing should always  be combined with medical care and treatment. It

          does not replace 

          doctors, medicine,  or hospitals, since different  levels (worlds) are

          involved.  In creative  visualization, we  visualize the  person being

          well. It may be helpful to utilize the appropriate color from the aura

          chart (such as bright apple-green, rose pink, or white) sent as a beam

          to the person  or as a  cloud surrounding him.  This technique can  be

          extended to include a simple kind of yoga in which we feel energy sent

          as we  exhale explosively; the  energy sent either  via the  breath or

          from one of the chakras such as the solar plexus.  Sometimes in absent

          healing it  is helpful  to arrange  a time  for treatment  in advance,

          asking your subject to be in a receptive state of mind and to sit back

          and close his eyes. 

           

          THE BANISHING RITUAL 

           

                          Oneofthemost basicanduseful ceremonialritualsof magick

          is called the *banishing ritual*, or lesser ritual of the pentagram. A

          pentagram (or pentacle) is a five-pointed  star with the point up. The




                                           1350

          banishing ritual is helpful in psychic protection and healing since it

          forms a protective barrier against malevolent forces. The psychic 

          barrier it  creates can  be made  to permit entry  of desired  (const-

          ructive) forces and the exclusion of negative ones.  Thus, the banish-

          ing ritual is an essential first step in almost any formal full magick

          ceremony.  The ritual  requires that  you use  a magical  implement or

          &quot;weapon&quot;, such as a 

          ceremonial  knife, wand, or simply point  your index finger, to &quot;draw&quot;

          the pentagram in the air  at each of the cardinal points  (four direc-

          tions). Also, you  will be chanting ('vibrating') some Hebrew names of

          God.  




























                                           1351

                          Holdingyour magicalweaponand facingeast,extend yourarm

          out straight in front  of you. In  this ritual you  will use the  full

          sweep of  your arm to draw the pentagram in  the air. Follow the desc-

          ription below by beginning at the lower left and sweeping your magical

          weapon up toward the 

          right, etc. as  shown. Do not  bend your  arm at the  wrist or  elbow.

          While you do  this, visualize  the lines  and eventually  the star  as

          vibrant white, floating  in the space before you.   You are projecting

          energy to  do this, and the  result will be a  gleaming 5-pointed star

          floating in  the east; visualize this  as vividly as you  can. Now you

          will energize it further 

          by piercing  the center of it  with your magical weapon  and vibrating

          (speaking  slowly in  a  slightly lower  than normal  pitch, remember)

          &quot;Yod-He-Vau-He&quot;.

          2. Point to 12 oclock position.

          ============================================= 

           

                          Thenturn slowlytothe nextcardinal pointinsequence, and

          as you do  so, with your arm still extended in front of you, visualize

          a white line connecting around to the  cardinal point. Trace a similar

          pentagram with the appropriate words and following the same procedure:

                  South -- Adonai Tzaboath 

                  West  -- Eh-Ei-He 

                  North -- Agla. 

          Now complete  the white line drawn  back to the center  of the eastern

          pentagram. Note that the cardinal points must be followed  in a clock-

          wise order, and the pentagram must be drawn in the manner illustrated;

          to do otherwise would change the function of the ritual. The result of

          all  this should be a large  bright white pentagram visualized hanging

          in mid-air 

          at each  of the four directions,  all tied together by  a bright white

          line. You could  now, for example, visualize the pentagrams moving out

          to the circumference of your home, thereby protecting all within. 



                          Thereisalsoa somewhatsimplifiedversion ofthisritual in

          which the pentagram is traced only once overhead and then is energized

          with one of the four names, such as &quot;Eh-Ei-He&quot;. Oftentimes the simpli-


                                           1353

          fied  version is  sufficient,  but naturally  the effect  of  the full

          version is more 

          complete.  



                          One ofthe primaryusesof thisritual istoward offpsychic

          attack --  that  is, when  another is  (consciously or  unconsciously)

          attempting to  harm you, cause  sickness, accidents, bad  dreams, emo-

          tional  upset, or  to force  you  to do  something against  your will.

          Fortunately this doesn't  happen very often. The world of the magician

          is fairly safe for the  pure of heart. Psychic attack usually  depends

          upon vulnerabilities.  If you are  not vulnerable  you are safe.  Thus

          unificaition with the  true will is the  greatest protection possible.

          And the use of the banishing ritual is never hurtful. You can even use

          it to hold off negative aspects of 

          yourself.  

                          Otherformsofprotection sometimeshelpful(depending upon

          one's model) are recitation of the 'Lord's Prayer', the 23rd, and 91st

          Psalms.

          ** MAGICK 9 -- ASTRAL PROJECTION ** 

           

                          Astral projection (OOBE,out of thebody experience) isa

          popular  area of occult literature; for  traveling to see other worlds

          and places  while  the physical  body  sleeps or  is entranced  is  an

          exciting  notion. Astral projection is not dangerous. It is as safe as

          sleeping.  Most  dreams are  probably unconscious  astral projections,

          anyway. Although there has 

          been  quite a  bit written on  the subject, astral  projection is dif-

          ficult for many people. The main  difficulty is the tendency to forget

          dream  consciousness  upon   awakening.  Accordingly,  the  successful

          practice of astral projection requires work. 



                          Modernpsychologydiscounts theideaofactual OOBE(thatthe

          spirit  temporarily vacates the physical body).   However, the idea is

          very ancient. The Tibetans have an entire system  of yoga (dream yoga)

          based upon astral  projection. And here we  have an important  assump-

          tion: you are involved  in an OOBE (at least to a degree) whenever you

          dream. What  sets it apart from a full OOBE is your hazy consciousness


                                           1356

          during the experience  and poor recall afterwards.  Many people forget

          most of their dreams completely. Learning astral projection requires a

          kind of inner mental clarity and alertness. 



                          Dreamsare adoor to thesubconscious whichcan beused for

          psychological  and spiritual insight,  and sometimes for precognition.

          Dream  content is  influenced by  external sounds and  sensations. For

          example, a loud external noise (such as a train) will likely appear in

          your dream (if it doesn't wake you up!). Dreams are also influenced by

          events of the previous day, by  your moods, and by suggestion.  Every-

          one  normally dreams 4 or  5 times a night (about  every 2 hours). The

          longest dreams  occur in the  morning. Everyone  dreams. You are  more

          likely to remember  the details of your dream when  you first wake up.

          By keeping a dream diary  you will improve dream recall.  Have writing

          equipment or  a tape recorder at your bedside for this purpose; also a

          light which isn't too bright. Suggest to yourself several times before

          you go to sleep, &quot;I will  awaken with the knowledge of a  dream.&quot; Then

          when you do awaken, move quietly (sometimes 

          just turning over  drives the idea away).  Remember first, then  write

          the dream down, and then add as many details as possible. The next day

          check for objective facts and expand if you  can (by remembering 'what

          happened before that'). Once you start remembering your dreams in this

          way, it will become easier to do so. (If you are unsuccessful at this,

          and  *really* want  to  remember your  dreams, you  could  arrange for


                                           1357

          someone to sit  by your bedside all  night long with  a dim light  on.

          Then when he sees your  eyes moving back and forth -- rapid  eye move-

          ments,  a sign you are dreaming -- he can wake you and ask for a dream

          report.) 

           

          FORMS OF ASTRAL PROJECTION 

           

                          Astralprojection maybesubdivided intothree basictypes:

          mental projection,  astral projection (proper) and etheric projection.

          And  your OOBE may  shift between them.   Mental  projection is really

          simple clairvoyance ('remote viewing'),  and 'traveling in your mind'.

          Imagination  plays a key role. The  experience of mental projection is

          not particularly vivid, and you will more likely be an observer than a

          participant. Nevertheless, mental projection  is an important 'way in'

          to astral projection proper. 



                          Duringmentalprojectionandastralprojection youareableto

          travel through solid  objects, but are not  able to act directly  upon

          them  or to move them (if they are in the physical world). This is not

          true  during etheric  projection.  Whether it  is simply  subconscious

          expectation,  or whether  it  is a  true etheric  projection  which in

          theory means that part  of your physical body has  been relocated with

          your  projection  (the  etheric or  vital  part) may  be  difficult to

          determine.  Etheric projections generally  travel at or  very near the


                                           1358

          physical  world. There are even cases  reported (very, very rare ones)

          in  which the entire physical body  is transferred to another location

          (teleportation),  or cases in which the  physical body exists and acts

          in two separate places at once (bilocation)!  



                          But ourprimary interestis astral projectionproper, and

          mental projection to a lesser extent. Astral and mental projection are

          not confined to the  physical world. Travel  in the mental and  astral

          realms is  feasible, and often  preferred. Nor  are astral and  mental

          projection restricted to the realm of  the earth (you could even go to

          the moon and planets). 

           


























                                           1359

          STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 

           

                          The electricalactivity ofthe brainhas beenobserved and

          classified with EEG  (electroencephalograph) equipment; signals picked

          up from the scalp by electrodes, then filtered and amplified,  drive a

          graph recorder.  Brain  activity has  been found  to produce  specific

          ranges for 

          certain basic states of consciousness, as indicated in 'hz' (hertz, or

          cycles/vibrations per second): 

                  delta -- 0.2 to 3.5 hz (deep sleep, trance state), 

                  theta -- 3.5 to 7.5 hz (day dreaming, memory), 

                          alpha-- 7.5to 13 hz(tranquility, heightenedawareness, 

          meditation), 

                  beta  -- 13 to 28 hz   (tension, 'normal' consciousness). 



          As you  can see, some  form of physical  relaxation is implied  in the

          alpha,  theta,  and  delta consciousness.  These  states  are in  fact

          reached through  deep breathing, hypnosis, and  other relaxation tech-

          niques. OOBE  occurs during these  states, and  delta is probably  the

          most important for it. 

          The  problem is really,  as we  have said,  one of  maintaining mental

          awareness  and  alertness while  experienceing  these altered  states.

          Experimental subjects hooked  to an EEG do not show  a discrete change

          from drowsy to sleep; it is very gradual. 


                                           1360

                          Atthe thresholdbetweensleep andwakingconsciousness isa

          drowsy condition known  as the hypnogogic state.  OOBE seems to  occur

          during  this state,  or a  variant of  it. By  careful control  of the

          hypnogogic state  (not going beyond it)  it is possible to  enter OOBE

          directly. 

           

          BASIC TECHNIQUES 

           

                          Mostmethodsofastralprojectionaremethodsofconditioning.

          Some form of  trance or altered consciousness  is always involved.  No

          one  ever projects consciously while fully  awake (some may think that

          they do). Although there are many techniques used to produce an astral

          projection, 

          they boil down to ten of them. They all sort of overlap. 






















                                           1361

                          1) Diet-- Certain dietarypractices mayaid in OOBE,esp-

          ecially at first. These include fasting, vegitarianism, and in general

          the  eating of  'light' foods  as discussed  in  a a  previous lesson.

          Carrots and raw eggs are thought  to be especially beneficial, but all

          nuts are  to be avoided.   Over-eating should be avoided.  And no food

          should be eaten just before an OOBE attempt. If you intend to practice

          during sleep, for  example, allow  2 to 4  hours of  no food or  drink

          (except water) before  bedtime. In general, we see  here the same kind

          of dietary restrictions advocated for kundalini yoga.  



                          2) Progressivemuscularrelaxation--This isoneofthebasic

          methods used  in hypnosis  and self-hypnosis. Physical  relaxation can

          assist  one in attaining the requisite  trance state. These techniques

          involve beginning at  the toes and tensing, then relaxing the muscles,

          progressively up the entire body. 



                          3)Yogaand breath-- Yoga,mantra, andbreathing exercises

          similarly aim at  physical relaxation. The practice of  kundalini yoga

          is  particularly relevant,  since it  is concerned  with altered  con-

          sciousness. In fact  the arousal of kundalini requires a similar state

          of consciousness to 

          OOBE.  






                                           1362

                          4)Visualization --This involvesa typeof extendedclair-

          voyance or picturing of remote surroundings. If you can experience the

          feeling of being there, so  much the better.  Although  this technique

          is  essentially mental  projection,  it is  possible to  deepen mental

          projection into astral 

          projection through  (you guessed it!) visualization.  Crowley taught a

          similar technique: a)  visualize a  closed door  on a  blank wall,  b)

          imagine a meditation symbol on the door, c) visualize the door opening

          and yourself 

          entering  through it.  And J.H.  Brennan describes  similar techniques

          wherein  the door is shaped and colored like a tattva, or alternately,

          a chosen tarrot card is visualized and the student visualizes entering

          into it. 



                          5) Guided imagery -- Inmany respects similar tovisual-

          ization. Except in this case, there is a guide (or perhaps a  voice on

          tape) directing you by  means of descriptions. As  with visualization,

          mental rather than astral projection is most likely. 














                                           1363

                          6)Body ofLight --The oldGolden Dawntechnique. Imaginea

          duplicate (mirror image)  of yourself in front  of you. Then  transfer

          your consciousness and sensation to the duplicate ('body of light'). 



                          7) Strongwilling -- Sort oflike creative visualization

          experienced in the  present. That is you express your strong desire to

          project through your willpower while you visualize yourself doing it. 



                          8) The Monroetechniques -- These are a series of steps

          developed by Robert Monroe: a) relax the body, b) enter the hypnogogic

          state, c) deepen the state, d) develope the senstation of 'vibration',

          e) separate  from the body.  The Monroe  Institute has developed  some

          cassete tapes which are claimed to help in this. 



                          9) Dreamcontrol --This isone ofthe mostimportant tech-

          niques. It involves  becoming aware that you  are dreaming. There  are

          several ways to do this. Oliver Fox says to look  for descrepancies in

          the dream  to realize you are  dreaming. One occult student  I know of

          visualized a white horse which he could ride wherever he wished to go.

          After a  time, when the  horse appeared in  his dreams it  was his cue

          that he was actually dreaming/projecting.  Don Juan tells Castaneda to

          look at his hands while he is  dreaming. And even the tarot and Cabala

          may be used as dream signals. 




                                           1364

          Another method is to tell yourself each night as you go  to  sleep, &quot;I

          can fly&quot;; then when you  do, you will know you are dreaming.  Once you

          know you  are dreaming you can control your dream/OOBE and go anywhere

          you  want.  Repetitive  activities  will also  likely  influence  your

          dreams.  For example, if you are on  an automobile trip and spend most

          of the  day driving, you will  probably dream about driving.   You can

          condition yourself to be aware you are  dreaming by doing a repetitive

          activity many times (walking across 

          the room or a  particular magick ritual, for  example). Then when  you

          dream about it, you will know you are dreaming.  



                          10)Dream expansion--Avariation ondream control.A dream

          may be  *extended* by imagining  it continuing from where  it was when

          you awaken.  Then it is  just a simple  step   to 'astral project'  by

          directing you 'dream'.  



                          Althoughallthesetechniques                                                   mayappearstraightforward,they

          all require effort. Astral projection is generally learned. 



                          The astral worldis the &quot;ghostland&quot;into which onepasses

          after death. It is sometimes  possible to visit with the dead,  or you

          might be called upon to reassure and assist those who have just passed

          over  (died) or  those who  are consciously  projecting for  the first

          time. Many spirits, 


                                           1365

          elementals  and ghosts exist in the  astral world. The magician should

          feel comfortable there. Tibetan belief is that through proficiency  in

          OOBE, you  no longer need reincarnate after death. The astral world is

          extremely 

          changeable and subject  to your thoughts. Your  will can control  your

          movements in the astral world,  and if you seem to be  going somewhere

          non-volitionally  ('astral current')  it  is probably  your true  will

          causing  it  anyway.  You  might also  experience  heightened  magical

          ability while in the astral realm.

          ** MAGICK 10 -- CABALA ** 

           

                          Western magick isbased uponthe Cabala,a Jewishmystical

          traditon  first written down in 12th  and 13th century southern France

          and  Spain.   It was  oral  before that;  and it  contains the  &quot;lost&quot;

          knowledge of the  ancients, possibly going back  to Egypt and  before.

          The most important Cabalistic 

          books are SEPHIR YETZIRAH (The Book of Creation), and  the ZOHAR (Book

          of  Splendor).  Through Cabalistic philosophy  we are able to classify

          and &quot;pigeon-hole&quot; all of existence. 



                          The fourworlds are recognizedin theCabala, but theyare

          given Hebrew  names.   Thus  --  Assiah, physical;  Yetzirah,  astral;

          Briah, mental; and Atziluth, spiritual; as shown in the chart.

          The divine  name of God  is TETRAGRAMMATON  (or name of  four letters)

          made from the Hebrew letters YOD HE VAU HE (English YHVH). Of the four

          letters, YOD corresponds  with Atziluth and the  element of fire;  the

          first HE  corresponds with Briah  and water.  These first two  letters

          make up  a yang-yin pair  (respectively). The  other two letters  also

          form a yang-yin 

          pair (respectively), with the VAU corresponding with Yetzirah and air;

          while the second HE corresponds with Assiah and the element of earth.

          highest  vehicles  of consciousness.  NESHAMAH  (Divine  Soul) is  the

          Spiritual  body; RUAH  (Moral  Soul) is  the Mental  body;  and NEFESH

          (Animal Soul) is the Astral body.

          our world at the bottom.  As can be seen in the  accompanying diagram,

                          Above theTree is theinfinite void-- the unknowable,un-

          manifest God as Divine Light -- the three veils of negative existence:

          Ain, Ain Sof, and Ain Sof Aur.  The Divine Light (Ain Sof Aur) is made

          manifest by  the first sefira  where it  is transformed into  positive

          existence.  Emanations of energy (magical current) flow from the first

          sefira  (Source) along the  paths into other  sefiroth which transform

          and emanate to  lower and lower  sefiroth. In  Adam Kadman (primal  or

          ideal man) the sefiroth fit upon the 

          physical body; note  the similarity  to the chakras.   The process  of

          creation is one of emanation from the spiritual at the top of the Tree

          to the  physical world  (Sink) at  the  bottom. All  current which  is

          Sourced into the Tree must also be Sinked (earthed).  That is, magical

          energy set in motion 

          by  ritual shoud be used  up in the physical  world whether or not the

          ritual was a success. 



                          Sefiroth1, 2,and 3on theTree form theSupernal Triangle

          which is beyond normal human experience in the world of Atziluth.  The

          first sefira, KETHER, is the supreme *crown* of God; it signifies pure

          Being, and  is the Source. Kether is  androgynous. Immediately arising

          from Kether are 

          two  further emanations. The second sefira  is HOKMAH, the *wisdom* of

          God  and the  masculine force  of the  universe. Third  is BINAH,  the

          *understanding* or intelligence of God; this is the supernal mother.

                          Between theSupernals and theother seven sefirothis the

          Abyss  -- a  great  gulf which  forever separates  ideal  from actual.

          Within the  Abyss an  11th sefira,  DAATH, the *knowledge*  of God  is

          sometimes placed. 



                          The second triangle, comprised of the 4th,5th, and 6th

          sefiroth in the  world of Briah, is  sometimes called the Mental  Tri-

          angle. Sefira  4, HESED,  the  *love* or  mercy of  God,  is male  and

          positive.  The 5th  sefira, GEVURAH,  the power  or *strength*  of God

          complements Hesed as  justice. Sixth is TIFARETH, as the compassion or

          *beauty* of God; the heart of the universe.

                          Thethird orAstralTriangle containssefiroth7, 8,and 9in

          Yetzirah.  Sefira 7, NETSAH, is the  lasting endurance or *victory* of

          God. Complementing Netsah is 8, HOD, the majesty or *splendor* of God.

          The 9th  sefira, YESOD, the *foundation* of  the world, is linked with

          the  moon, hence  the tides  and the  libido. Yesod is  experienced as

          dream  consciousness,  and  is very  important  in  magick  and astral

          projection. 



                          Finally,at thephysicalworld ofAssiah isthe10th sefira,

          MALKUTH, the *kindgom* of God, and the basis of all material creation.

          We experience Malkuth as sense consciousness.

          ending with Netsah, is called the Pillar of Mercy and has light/mascu-

          line (yang)  qualities. The  pillar on the  left, headed by  Binah and

          ending with Hod,  is the Pillar of  Severity with dark/feminine  (yin)

          qualities.  The  Middle  Pillar  between them  equilibriates  the  two

          opposites,  and is  the *Shekhinah*, or  feminine counterpart  of God.

          The *klippoth*,  or evil  demons, generally  in Assiah,  represent un-

          balanced forces or excesses.

          fact the paths  which run between  the sefiroth have their  own colors

          too.   There are  four major color  scales for the  sefirotic tree and

          each color scale corresponds  with one of the four worlds.  That means

          we  are dealing with not just one  sefirotic tree, but actually with a

          separate tree  for each of the  four worlds; although it  is easier to

          think  of it as the same tree  with a different color scale. The Queen

          (Briah) and King (Atziluth) scales are 

          the most important. There is also  the Empress scale (Assiah), and the

          Emperor scale (Yetzirah).

                          The 22 paths connectthe sefiroth together. These paths

          correspond with the  22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet,  as based upon

          the SEFIR  YETZIRAH. Due to  the nature of  the Hebrew  alphabet (some


                                           1377

          letters can take two forms) SEFIR  YETZIRAH divides each of two of the

          letters into  two (dual) parts.  For this reason,  it is  necessary to

          divide each  of the two related paths into two (dual) parts. These are

          numbered 31, 31b (bisected); 32, 32b.   Yet when these paths are drawn

          on  the sefirotic tree they are  usually shown undivided (and numbered

          simply 31, and 32).  The following 

          table shows  the colors and location  of the paths in  relation to the

          sefiroth. You will want to add the path numbers to the illustration of

          the sefirotic tree, or draw a new  tree. Some writers may refer to &quot;32

          paths&quot;, by calling the sefiroth &quot;paths&quot; 1-10.

          consciousness which is useful  for understanding and attaining various

          states of  consciousness. In cabalistic  magick we are  concerned with

          the linking  of higher energy to  lower levels on the  tree. That very

          thing takes place naturally as well, in nature and in  life. A subject

          in  itself is cabalistic meditation (pathwork,  or the way of return),

          in which we attempt to climb up the tree (ladder of lights) to  attain

          union with divinity.

          ** MAGICK 11 -- PSYCHIC ENERGY ** 

           

                          We have seen in the theories of magick, that there isa

          definite relationship between  the 'inner' and 'outer' worlds.  We saw

          this in  the theory of  the microcosm and  the macrocosm; in  the four

          worlds; in the theory  of correspondences; and also in  the Cabala and

          Tree  of Life.   This  relationship between  inner and  outer is  very

          important.  And it means quite simply that  success (or lack of it) in

          one  world (inner or outer) influences success  (or lack of it) in the

          other. Therefore developing of magical ability is more than meditation

          and magical practice, for it 

          implies mastery of the four worlds. The developed magician is not only

          master of the inner worlds; he is also master of himself. 



                          Thisis notto implythat successfulmagicians areall mil-

          lionaires (or  whatever standard  people measure  success by),  but it

          should  mean that  they are  basically pleasant  people, at  least; no

          serious hangups. The  developed magician is described  as a 'king'  in

          the Book of the Law.  This means simply that he has full  control over


                                           1384

          all aspects of his physical  and inner life. He should be who he wants

          to be, doing what he wants to do.

          *correspondence tables*  (such as Crowley's '777').  One important set

          of correspondences for the planets, is shown below...

          Notice that  we have included  the metal which is  associated with the

          planet,  as well  as common attributes  of each planet.  The theory of

          Cabalistic magick is  to select the appropriate planet for the desired

          result. The  attribute column will  assist in  that selection. Once  a

          particular  planet  is  determined,  an entity  is  selected  from the

          correspondence tables by  matching the key number. A set of correspon-

          dence tables may be available on this board as a separate file (777.A-

          RC). Additionally,  a list  of selected deities  from several  popular

          pantheons and with a brief description about them  may be available on

          this board as GODS.LST. 



                          AlthoughHebrewMysticismistheoriginalsourceofCabalistic

          ideas, it is mostly unconcerned with the magical implications of those

          ideas. How  can  a religious  philosophy  which is  monotheistic  lend

          credibility to a polytheistic approach? Various deities are understood

          as *aspects* or  *qualities* of the  Supreme God. This  is not a  con-

          tradiction, merely a restatement  of the microcosm-macrocosm idea once

          again. The Sefirotic Tree, in its representation of the universe is 

          the Macrocosm. While it could be said that any single sefiroth has its

          own  separate qualities, it remains, nonetheless,  a part of the whole

          tree, and 

          a part of the macrocosm. As a result, virtually any pantheon or belief

          system is compatible with the Cabala.

          WILLPOWER AND MAGICK 

           

                          Western magick has traditionallyplaced a great deal of

          emphasis upon  the use  of  willpower as  a means  of development  and

          self-mastery.  But this may  not be the  best method in  the long run.

          Isaac  Bonewitz describes  how the  subconscious will  sometimes rebel

          against willpower with  'spectacular results'. It is far better to run

          one's life democratically. 



                          HawaiianKahunamagick describesthe'threeselves', ie.the

          lower self  (or subconscious), the  middle self (or  normal conscious-

          ness),  and the high self (spirit  or Holy Guardian Angel). Enlighten-

          ment  in the  Hawaiian  system consists  of unification  of  the three

          selves. They become 'buddies'. Enlightenment does not  come from great

          change. It comes from  great acceptance. Continual effort at  becoming

          better takes  you nowhere.  For  becoming it  is not  being  it.   The

          unification  is achieved  by first  developing communication  with the

          subconscious and later  with the high self also. Simple exercises with

          a pendulum, automatic writing, raised finger responses, self hypnosis,

          recording and  analysis of  dreams etc. facilitate  communication with

          the subconscious. At  first communication with the  high self must  be

          via the subconscious, but later it is possible to go direct to it.

                          Manyoccult groupsfollowan energymodel formagickand the

          physical  body. This  model  (or theory)  equates psychic  energy with

          kundalini/prana/sexual or  life force  energy. The ideal  of kundalini

          yoga is thus  to raise the kundalini to the higher chakras (especially

          ajna and 

          sahasrara) thereby  enhancing psychic/magick  powers.  The release  of

          psychic energy  is also relevant  to mental  control, good health  and

          longevity, and  the attainment  of 'cosmic  consciousness'. Meditation

          and yoga is used to 

          liberate psychic energy  so that it can be used  for magical purposes.

          But there  are other ways  to liberate psychic  energy. Many  of these

          techniques will act as a mental catharsis in the sense of invigorating

          the psyche and 

          resulting in improved intellectual and physical performance.

          it.

                          Wehave seenhowmagical theoryis baseduponthe assumption

          that psychic phenomena  is real. If  this is so,  then magick is  also

          real. And  we have  also seen how  magick is  the art  and science  of

          causing  change in  accordance  with the  will by  non-physical means.

          Magical philosophy is the 

          working system of  terms, theories, and symbols  upon which magick  is

          based. But magick goes further than  that, for as an ancient system of

          psychology,  magick may be used as is  a means of self improvement and

          spiritual  growth. For magick  and mysticism are  parallel paths, each

          ultimately leading to transcendence.
