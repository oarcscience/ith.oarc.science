          FULL MOON RITUAL
          October 12, 1992
          Led by Baba Yaga (Grandmother Owl) with Shadow Hawk and Rilla

          (1-3,Baba Yaga) I also wanted to remind everyone that if you are
          someone who feels
          ...
          (1-3,Baba Yaga) that Columbus isn't your A#1 hero, we can put in a
          polite bow to the
          (1-3,Baba Yaga) residents of Turtle Island were here to greet him.
          (1-3,Baba Yaga) The strange words you'll see in the ritual are Chero-
          kee for the
          Spirit
          (1-3,Baba Yaga) guardians of the Quarters, the God, Goddess and
          Ancestors/Community/Totems.

          (1-1,S.H.) striking chime once

          (1-1,S.H.) Relax your bodies, feel the tension flow out of them....
          (1-1,S.H.) send your awareness down, down, into your feet...
          (1-1,S.H.) and from your feet, feel the connection to the earth
          pulling at you
          (1-1,S.H.) slowly, begin to breath deep...
          (1-1,S.H.) and with each breath you take, fill your body with en-
          ergy...
          (1-1,S.H.) and with each exhale, push it down through your feet into
          the earth...
          (1-1,S.H.) the connection grows stronger, and the barriers break down
          (1-1,S.H.) breath by breath, wall by wall, and the earth becomes alive
          (1-1,S.H.) beneath you.
          (1-1,S.H.) Now, as you inhale, let the energy flow completely through
          you into the
          earth...
          (1-1,S.H.) and as you exhale, begin to pull energy from the earth up
          into your
          body...
          (1-1,S.H.) you are awash in the energies of Father Sky and Mother
          Earth, they
          (1-1,S.H.) are cleansing and balancing your body with each breath you
          take.
          (1-1,S.H.) Air and Earth, you are balancing, you are grounding, you
          are 
          (1-1,S.H.) attaining peace and harmony with our Mother and our Father-
          ...
          (1-1,S.H.) Breath gently, and be at one.

          (1-3,Baba Yaga) (moving to the east and raising my athame high)

          (1-3,Baba Yaga) This athame is the symbol of Air, the element of the
          East. 
          (1-3,Baba Yaga) I summon the powers of the East, the winds of thought
          and
          intelligence,...
          (1-3,Baba Yaga) the storms of inspiration and learning. Here arises
          Awahili, the


                                                                            2157

          Eagle,...
          (1-3,Baba Yaga) where the sun does ever shine. Give to us the wisdom
          of the east.
          ...
          (1-3,Baba Yaga) We invite these spirits to this our celebration of
          their powers.

          (1-1,S.H.) (moving to the South)
          (1-1,S.H.) (taking breath, and raising Wand high)

          (1-1,S.H.) This Wand is the symbol of Fire, the Element of the South. 
          I
          (1-1,S.H.) summon the powers of the South, the fires of directed will,
          of
          (1-1,S.H.) energy and spirit.  Here dwells Tsistu, the Rabbit, the
          Trickster
          (1-1,S.H.) in the direction we are always facing.  Grant us the
          ability to
          (1-1,S.H.) attune ourselves to the energy of the South.  We invite
          these
          (1-1,S.H.) Spirits to lend us their aid in our work tonight.

          ...
          (1-3,BYaga) Holding water over head facing west)

          (1-3,BYaga) This water is the essence of Water, the Element of the
          West. ...
          (1-3,BYaga) I summon the powers of emotion and love, understanding and
          caring.
          (1-3,BYaga) Here dwells Yanu, the Bear, where the sun lies down and
          dies ...
          (1-3,BYaga) It is the home of the thunders: the source of knowledge of
          our inner
          (1-3,BYaga) beings. Grant us thy inner peace and understanding. ...
          (1-3,BYaga) We invite these spirits to permeate all that we do here.

          with stream of
          water)
          (1-3,BYaga) (lighting candle)

          (1-1,S.H.) ~(I move to the North and raise a container of Salt high)

          (1-1,S.H.)  This Salt is the symbol of Earth, the Element of the
          North.  We
          (1-1,S.H.) summon the strength and protection of the rocks and the
          trees, the


                                                                            2158

          ____________________________________________

          EXPLANATORY NOTES

          Awahili is Cherokee for Eagle, the spirit keeper of the East. This is
          the messenger
          to the powers and the bird of the chieftain.

          Sistu is Cherokee for Rabbit. the spirit keeper of the South for the
          Eastern
          Woodland Indians. Western Indians use the Coyote her. In any case it
          represents
          teaching through humor or by showing how NOT to do things. Think of
          the B'rer Rabbit
          stories: &quot;Please 
          don thro me in dat briar patch!&quot;


                                                                            2162

          Yanu is Cherokee for Bear, the spirit keeper of the West. Yanu is the
          healer, she
          who gave the sweat lodge to the people and the bear is the chief of
          the council of
          the four-leggeds. The thunders are 'chancy' powers, sometimes good and
          sometimes
          evil.

          Yunsu is Cherokee for Buffalo, the spirit keeper of the North. Yes,
          buffalo once
          roamed a lot of the East! The buffalo provides for our mundane needs
          with food,
          clothing, shelter and, in the planes, fuel. For the Sioux (Lakota) the
          buffalo also
          gives the sacred pipe to the people, their communication with the
          powers.

          Agisegua is the Great female or Great Doe of the Cherokee. There are
          other female
          power figures which might have been used including the Corn Mother.

          Galunlati is 'him above' in Cherokee and is one of many possible names
          for deity
          above.

          Agayunli means &quot;old&quot; and refers to 'ancestors'; the grandmothers and
          grandfathers
          who are the wise ones. 'Grandmother' and/or 'Grandfather' were used as
          respectful
          address to persons considered wise without regard to actual kinship.

          Nunahi are the spirits and totems which surround us. It might be
          translated as the
          'immortals'.
