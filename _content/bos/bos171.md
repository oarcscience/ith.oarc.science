         the study and practice of the Druidic Arts and Keltic Magick.
         Through training, networking, resources, ritual and
         communications we strive to provide a religious and spiritual
         framework through which each individual can reach his of her own

         Keltrian Druidism."  Classes in neo-pagan Druidism are offered
         in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area on an ongoing basis.
         Campouts and workshops are held on an irregular basis in
         Northwestern Wisconsin.  Future plans include a book of ritual,
