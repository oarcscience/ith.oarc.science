                         MONROE TECHNIQUES FOR ASTRAL PROJECTION 


                   Note: After having studied many methods of Astral
              Projection, I have found that this is the easiest to do.
              Monroe teaches these techniques in a week, but they can be
              easily done in a day, with proper devotion. I feel that this
              technique is superior to others because it doe not require
              intense visualization, which many people cannot do. 
              enjoy! 


              (Taken from Leaving The Body: A Complete Guide to Astral
              Projection, D. Scott Rogo, prentice Hall Press) 

              One of the chief barriers people learning to project face is
              fear.  Many are afraid that they may die, or be harmed in some
              way as a result of their projection.  Nothing could be farther
              from the truth.  The Canterbury Institute, renowned for its
              occult studies, executed an experiment in projection involving
              over 2,000 people.  None of them were hurt in any way by this,
              and now, three years later, none have complained of any newly
              arising problems. 

              Once you are aware that you cannot be harmed by projecting,
              you should begin monroe's techniques, step by step. 

              Step one: 
                  Relax the body. According to Monroe, &quot;the ability to relax
              is the first prerequisite, perhaps even the first step itself&quot;
              to having an OBE. (out of body experience) This includes both
              physical and mental relaxation. Monroe does not suggest a
              method of attaining this relaxation, although Progressive
              Muscle relaxation, coupled with deep breathing exercises
              (inhale 1, exhale 2, inhale 3.... until 50 or 100) are known
              to work well. 
               
              Step two: 
                  Enter the state bordering sleep.  This is known as the
              hypnagogic state. Once again, Monroe doesn't  recommend any
              method of doing this.  One way is to hold your forearm
              up, while keeping your upper arm on the bed, or ground. As you
              start to fall asleep, your arm will fall, and you will awaken
              again.  With practice, you can learn to control the Hypnagogic
              state without using your arm.  Another method is to
              concentrate on an object.  When other images start to enter
              your thoughts, you have entered the Hypnagogic state.
              Passively watch these images.  This will also help you
              maintain this state of near-sleep. Monroe calls this Condition
              A. 

              Step three: 
                  Deepen this state. Begin to clear your mind.  observe your
              field of vision through your closed eyes.  Do nothing more
              for a while. Simply look through your closed eyelids at the
              blackness in front of you.  After a while, you may notice
              light patterns.  These are simply neural discharges.  They
              have no specific effect.  Ignore them.  When they cease, one

                                                                             785

              has entered what Monroe calls Condition B.  From here, one
              must enter an even deeper state of relaxation which Monroe
              calls Condition C-- a state of such relaxation that you lose
              all awareness of the body and sensory stimulation.  You are
              almost in a void in which your only source of stimulation will
              be your own thoughts. 
                  The ideal state for leaving your body is Condition D.
              This is Condition C when it is voluntarily induced from a
              rested and refreshed condition and is not the effect of normal
              fatigue.  To achieve Condition D, Monroe suggests that you
              practice entering it in the morning or after a short nap. 

              Step Four: 
                  Enter a state of Vibration. This is the most important
              part of the technique, and also the most vague.   
                  Many projectors have noted these vibrations at the onset
              of projection.  They can be experienced as a mild tingling, or
              as is electricity is being shot through the body.  /their
              cause is a mystery.  It may actually be the astral body trying
              to leave the physical one. 
              For entering into the vibrational state, he offers the
              following directions: 

              1. Remove all jewelry or other items that might be touching
              your skin. 
              2. Darken the room so that no light can be seen through your
              eyelids, but do not shut out all light. 
              3. Lie down with your body along a north-south axis, with your
              head pointed toward magnetic north. 
              4. Loosen all clothing, but keep covered so that you are
              slightly warmer than might normally be comfortable. 
              5. Be sure you are in a location where, and at a time  when,
              there will be absolutely no noise to disturb you. 
              6. Enter a state of relaxation 
              7. Give yourself the mental suggestion that you will remember
              all that occurs during the upcoming session that will be
              beneficial to your well-being. Repeat this five times. 
              8. Proceed to breath through your half-open mouth. 
              9. As you breath, concentrate on the void in front of you. 
             10. Select a point a foot away from your forehead, then change
              your point of mental reference to six feet. 
             11. Turn the point 90 degrees upward by drawing an imaginary
              line parallel to your body axis up and above your head.  Focus
              there and reach out for the vibrations  at that point and
              bring them back into your body. 

                   Even if you don't know what these vibrations are, you
              will know when you have achieved contact with them. 

              Step five: 
                  Learn to control the vibrational state.  Practice
              controlling them by mentally pushing them into your head, down
              to your toes, making them surge throughout your entire body,
              and producing vibrational waves from head to foot.  To produce
              this wave effect, concentrate of the vibrations and mentally
              push a wave out of your head and guide it down your body.
              Practice this until you can induce these waves on command. 
                  Once you have control of the vibrational state, you are

                                                                             786

              ready to leave the body. 

              Step six: 
                  Begin with a partial separation.  The key here is thought
              control.  Keep your mind firmly focused on the idea of leaving
              the body. Do not let it wander. Stray thought might cause you
              to lose control of the state. 
                  Now, having entered the vibrational state, begin exploring
              the OBE by releasing a hand or a foot of the &quot;second body&quot;.
              Monroe suggests that you extend a limb until it comes in
              contact with a familiar object, such as a wall near your bed.
              Then push it through the object. Return the limb by placing it
              back into coincidence with the physical one, decrease the
              vibrational rate, and then terminate the experiment.  Lie
              quietly until you have fully returned to normal. This exercise
              will prepare you for full separation. 
                  
              Step seven: 
                  Dissociate yourself from the body. Monroe suggests two
              methods for this.  One method is to lift out of the body.  To
              do this, think about getting lighter and lighter after
              entering this vibrational state.  Think about how nice it
              would be to float upward.  Keep this thought in mind at all
              costs and let no extraneous thoughts interrupt it. An OBE will
              occur naturally at this point. 
                 Another method is the &quot;Rotation method&quot; or &quot;roll-out&quot;
              technique.  When you have achieved the vibrational state, try
              to roll over as if you were turning over in bed.  /do not
              attempt to roll over physically.  Try to twist your body from
              the top and virtually roll over into your second body right
              out of your physical self.  At this point, you will be out of
              the body but next to it.  Think of floating upward, and you
              should find yourself floating above the body. 
                  Monroe suggests you begin with the lift-out method, but
              argues that both are equally efficacious. 

              If, after all this, you still can't project, I recommend
              purchasing Leaving The Body, by R. Scott Rogo.  It only costs
              $7.95 and contains another eight or so techniques.  Not all
              techniques work for everyone, but chances are you'll find one
              that works for you in this book.  Good luck! 

                                                                             787
