                           MAGICK, Physics, and Probability


     Now, as  most of you  may know, Magick  is a somewhat  controversial issue.
     Even the spelling of  the word is argued about!  I have picked up the habit
     (only the gods  know where I picked  it up ... possibly  from my occasional
     perusals of  Crowley)  of using  &quot;Magick&quot;  for the  real thing,  and  using
     &quot;Magic&quot; for what a stage magician does. 

     Before I go any further, I guess that I had better define Magick.  One 
     definition is: &quot;the art or science of causing change to occur in conformity
     to Will&quot; - A. Crowley.

     Now,  while Crowley himself,  was quite controversial,  I think we  can all
     agree that this should serve as a generic definition of Magick. But, one of
     the  differences between  types of  magicks  is in  the way  of raising  or
     calling energy to cause change.  Thus, such a change may be accomplished in
     one of a couple of ways:        

     1. The magick may be caused by the action of only one person or group of 
     people.

     2. The magick  may be caused by the intercession of  some higher (or lower)
     being who was evoked or controlled by a person or group of people.        

     3. The magick may  be caused by the action of one person or group of people
     who is/are &quot;borrowing&quot; energy from some higher being (lower beings may sell
     energy, but seldom lend or give it).        

     4. The magick may be caused by the person or persons use of an object or 
     location which was previously charged with energy (ie. a Magickal Tool, 
     Talisman, standing stones,  etc).

     Note:  The use of a sacrifice (which can range from symbolic sacrifices of 
     Grain, Wine, etc., all the way to Human Sacrifice [something which I, 
     personally, am against]) is  a combination of  methods, in that a  relative
     amount of energy is released at  the sacrifice itself, and, a larger amount
     of energy is usually then given forth by a higher or lower being.  

     In many ways, Magick is quite similar to the harder sciences.  In both, one
     must expend  energy in order to effect a change, or, TANSTAAFL (There Ain't
     No Such Thing As A Free Lunch).  Another difference between types of Magick
     is in the Focusing or Concentrating of the power being raised.  This may be
     accomplished through the  use of chanting, singing, dancing,  various types
     of meditation, and  through formalized Ritual steps,  which may or may  not
     involve  Magickal Tools.    Which brings  us  up to  another  controversial
     issue...    the use  and meaning  of the  Circle  in Wiccan  and Ceremonial
     Magicks.  

                                                                             813

     Now,  as some of you  may know, a Magickal Circle  serves a couple of uses,
     and, as  far as I can  see, the argument is  really over which  is the most
     important aspect of such a Circle.  Most modern Wicca types will say that a
     Circle's property of: &quot;Holding  and concentrating the energy being  raised,
     until it is ready  to be released&quot; is the most important.   Many Ceremonial
     types  cite  the  Circle's  ability  to  keep  out  negative  energies  and
     influences as being  most important.  While, some others  say that a Circle
     relates the tie of  spirit to body, and the ability of spirit to act on the
     body, with the tie of the people on the inside to the world(s) without, and
     a similar ability to cause change.  

     As for my  own position on this  argument, while, in most areas,  I tend to
     favor the  Wiccan position (albeit,  with a decidedly  Discordian slant),in
     this  case, I'll say:  &quot;Who CARES which is most important!?!  A Circle does
     all of the above, and  more, but, it's not worth arguing over!&quot;   So, on to
     the heart of  this article:  Explaining Magick in  terms of Quantum Physics
     [{chuckle},  I knew  a couple  of Physicists  who used  to explain  Quantum
     Physics in terms  of Magick {grin}].   This covers  the how and  why Magick
     works.  PLEASE NOTE:  I do not claim to be infallible, this is not a laying
     down of  the  LAW.   Rather,  this is  simply  a theory.    But then,  E  =
     MC(squared)is simply  a theory.   However there  exists lots of  data which
     supports both  theories.   Since  I've already covered some  basic Magickal
     Theory,  it looks like  time to start on  the Physics end  of things.  I'll
     start with the theories of Probability and Uncertainty.   

     Probability can be likened to  Voltaire's Theory that:  &quot;Since this  is the
     Only One of  All Possible Worlds that  we know, it must,  therefore, be the
     Best of All Possible Worlds!&quot;.   While this may be an  interesting concept,
     Voltaire's logic is slightly flawed.  A better statement would be: &quot;This is
     the most Probable of All Possible Worlds&quot;.  Thus, the Theory of Probability
     is quite  simple.  Everything we  see or experience is  due to probability.
     An Apple, when dropped, will fall (as long as it's in a gravity well, like,
     the surface  of a planet, and, no  other forces are acting  on it), because
     falling is  the most  probable course  of action open  to it.   Uncertainty
     comes into play when there  IS no one most probable thing to  happen.  Good
     examples of uncertainty in action are small things, like electrons in orbit
     around an atom.  Since there is no one most probable spot for that electron
     to be,  it isn't in  one place.   There is a  locus of  higher probability,
     where  in a  lower  energy electron  is more  likely  to be  closer to  the
     nucleus, and higher energy ones farther away.   Thus, scientists may either
     pin  down where an electron is, or, where  it is going, but, they CAN'T pin
     down  both at the  same time.   Also, electrons  tend to vibrate  in energy
     level,  spontaneously bouncing  up  and down,  seeking their  most probable
     states.  

                                                                             814

     So, &quot;Where  does Magick come  into play?&quot; one  may ask (assuming,  that is,
     that one has made it this far).  Well, one of the tenants of the Theory of 
     Probability is that: the possibility of an event occurring depends upon the
     events probability.  Thus, if said probability can be changed, one could, 
     theoretically,  either make such an event happen,  or prevent such an event
     from happening.  And this is what Magick really is ... the Art of Changing 
     Probability.   And,  here's how  that  happens ...  Einstein, as  some  may
     recall, was NOT  happy with the  theory of Probability. Since,  who decides
     what is  most probable, and, how  can such decisions be  altered?  Einstein
     said &quot;God does not play dice with the universe!&quot;, and tried, for years,  to
     come up  with a better theory.   But, he failed,  and so far,  all the data
     collected tends to  support the theory  of Probability.   Some others  have
     come up with possible answers to the above posed question.  One of which is
     that  Chance  determines probability  (this  is  the theory  that  Einstein
     commented  upon).   Another  theory  is  that  some  sort  of  GOD  decides
     probability.  Needless to  say, whatever being who could  alter probability
     at will, WOULD be a god!   And so, that brings  us to the present state  of
     affairs.   No doubt, even as I write, somewhere, there is someone trying to
     come  up with some more theories governing the manipulation of probability,
     and  thus, allowing  the construction  of a machine  which does  just that.
     But, there are also some who have found that such a machine exists... 

     PEOPLE!       There  is  already lots  of evidence,  some documented,  most
     overlooked or  kept hidden  by  the use  of vows,  that  People CAN  affect
     probability. 
     Blessed Be... Hurn
