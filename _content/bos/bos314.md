                         EAST 
                   (INVOCATION)
              Facing East:

                   Guardians of the watchtower  of the east, we do summon, stir, and
              call thee up  to protect us in  our rite. Come to  us now on the  cool
              breath of Autumn's sigh which 
              heralds the advent of Winter  and the close of harvest time.   Breathe
              into us the spirit of the pure joy of life.  So mote it be! 
               
              Responsorial:  So mote it be! 

                         AIR (invocation) 
              (Celebrant with the incense burner symbolizing the element of air) :

                   "I am  everywhere.  I  fill the fleshy  pouches of your  lungs, I
              stir all  things from the smallest blade of grass to the tallest tree.
              I cool you with my breezes and 
              destroy you with my storms.  
              Without me you would die.  Am I not holy and worthy of praise? "

                         EAST 
                   (BANISHMENT)
              Facing East:  

                   "Guardians of the watchtower of the east, return now to the brisk
              Autumn  breezes which are brimming  with the excitement  of the year's
              climax.  Take with you our 
              blessings and thanks. Hail and 
              farewell! 
               
              Responsorial:  Hail and farewell! 


                                                                                1543
