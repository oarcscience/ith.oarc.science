                                     destroy the False Ones who
                                     had exalted themselves and
                                     deceived some Mayas to
                                     worship them; and defeated
                                     the Lords of Death.

      18  -  Nucuch Chacob  -  &quot;The Great Chacs&quot;  Four horsemen
                               who are the Rain Gods.  They

      19  -  Balanke  -  &quot;Jaguar-Sun&quot;  This aspect of the Sun is
                         the essence of Strenght (warrior-type
                         strenght).  He is considered a Great
                         Breast.  All His Priests and Priestesses
                         are His harlots.

      20  -  Xob  -  Mother of Maize.  All Maize Deities sprang
                     from Her seed (literally corn seed).

                                                                             837

      22  -  Itzam Na  -  as Great God who oversees Justice
                          between the Gods and the Mayan who
                          worships the Gods.
      


      23  -  Ku Kulcan  -  The Aztecs called Him &quot;Quetzalcoatl&quot;. 
                          He is the God of Self-sacrifice which
                          was done so the Maya could survive
                          and gain acknowledgement of Itzam Na.
                          Some myths place Him as the Judge of
                          the dead (but I would take this with
                          a gain of salt).

      24  -  Yum Cimil  -  &quot;Lord of Death&quot;.

      25  -  Zip  -  Protector of the Deer (according to myth
                     the Deer created the Vagina of the Moon
                     Goddess by stepping on Her abdomen and then
                     she was able to bear children of the Sun
                     God. Note the sole of deer's foot looks like
                     a Vagina).  Zip would deceive hunters to
                     believe he was shooting a deer when in fact
                     it was a iguana (a sacred animal of Itzam
                     Na; to kill one incites the Death penalty).
                     To those who gained Zip's Favor meant a
                     successful hunt.

      26  -  Ah Ahaah Cab  -  &quot;Awakener&quot;  He is associated with
                              the Morning Star (Venus).

      27  -  Cit Chac Coh  -  &quot;Father Red Great Puma&quot;  The Lord
                              God of War.
             Buluc Chabtan  -  The God of Human Sacrifice and War.

      28  -  Bolon Tzcab  -  The Ruling-Lineage Diety.  He kept the
                             Line of Itzam Na pure and made sure the
                             Nobility of the Maya was strong.

      29  -  XAhau  -  as Moon Goddess.

                             a golden Sun eye (some say it was
                             almond eye) at the place of His
                             Ajna Chakra.

      31  -  Hun Kak  -  &quot;Unique Fire&quot;  The Divine Fire that
                         consumes all what ever remains is
                         prepared for Divinity.

      32  -  Ben Ich  -  &quot;He of the Starry Sky&quot;

                                                                             838
