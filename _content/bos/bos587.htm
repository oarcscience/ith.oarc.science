                             WARRIORS
 ** Gwydyon Masengale,  P.O.Box 4,  Tolleson, Az 85353**

 
 A Warrior is born with Three Things,
 A Body, A Mind, and A Spirit...

 With these three things a Warrior is to build a Life,
 A Life of Balance, A Life of Peace, A Life of Will. 

  A Warrior is born with Three Things,
   A Body...

 Speed, Dexterity, and Reflexes, these are the gifts of the Gods to 
 A Warrior.  Skills can be learned, but the gifts are rare, and are 
 to be honed to the sharpest of edges and used to build...
   A Life of Balance.

 A physical battle is quite simply an exercise, in which A Warrior
 is given the opritunity to use the gifts of the Gods, and test the 
 skills learned on this plane.  It will at times be necessary to use 
 the gifts and the skills knowen to A Warrior to build...
   A Life of Peace.

 Through training, the development of the gifts and skills combined can
 become a formidable weapon.  Perfect Balance, Peace of Mind, and An
 Indomitable Spirit are necessary for A Warrior to build...
               A Life of Will...                     

               A Warrior is born with Three Things,
   A Mind...

 Intellect, Creativity, and Common Sence, these are the compasses and 
 maps given A Warrior to help in navigating this existance.  In life 
 A Warrior will make mistakes.  The way these mistakes are handled
 will set the tone of countless lives determining the measure of 
 A Warrior's steel.  A Warrior will accept responsibility for the 
 actions taken, learn from them, and use the experiance to build...
   A Life of Balance.

 A Warrior must constantly endeavor to learn all that is to be learned
 of the path ahead, always drawing inspiration from the path which
 lies behind.  For strength is the knowledge drawn from the past, and
 discretion is the wisdom of the future which empowers the Warrior
 to build...
   A Life of Peace.

 A Warriors mind is to be constantly sharpened, for the mind alone
 IS the most formidable weapon the Warrior will ever posses.  
 The balance of knowledge and wisdom is the temporing of the steel 
 that makes A Warrior, lending the strength necessary to build...
   A Life of Will.

  A Warrior is Born With Three Things,
   A Spirit...

 A Warrior will carry a shield of Honor.  The strength of which 
 is in perfect balance with the Honor of the Warrior.


 The Warrior will carry a sword of Truth.  With an edge that mirrors the

 inner peace and honesty of the Warrior.

 A Warrior will wear a helmet of Integrity.  With power matched only 
 by the will of the Warrior.

 While battles can be fought and won with the well trained body.  
 While wars can be waged and won with the tempored and sharpened mind.
 The most perilous test A Warrior will face is the test of the Spirit.
 Here the Gods give no gifts.  A Warrior will have only the strengths 
of the spiritthat have been developed in the short life on the physical 
plane.  

  A Warrior is born with Three Things,
  A Body, A Mind, and A Spirit...

  With these Three Things A Warrior must build a Life,
   A Life Eternal...

  My Name is Nite Hawk,
