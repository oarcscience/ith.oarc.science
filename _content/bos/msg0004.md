    Hi there,

    I thought you might be interested in the following
    articles for your Book of Shadows section on Sacred
    texts.

    Self Dedication explained

    ===================================================

    Initiation is a process of "death and rebirth" - the
    old self dies, and the new and magickal self is born.
    A rite of self-dedication marks a serious commitment
    and dedication to the path, and should not be taken
    lightly.

    Having followed your path this far, you will have
    noticed subtle (or not so subtle) changes in your
    self, and you may wish to mark this, and affirm your
    commitment to the path with a self-dedication ritual.
    Initiation is a process which happens over time, and
    the rite itself will benefit from being preceded by a
    daily practice, building up in intensity as you
    approach the day of the rite, with the dedication rite
    being the culmination of this ritual practice.

    As the rite marks a rebirth, into your witch self or
    magickal self, you may wish to obtain a new magickal
    item or items for it. This could be a piece of ritual
    jewellery, such as a pentagram pendant, or amber and
    jet necklace (the traditional witches necklace), or a
    cord you wear around your waist. Some people choose to
    mark their dedications by having a tattoo in a
    magickal design, personal to themselves.

    It is also good to have a magickal weapon which you
    will consecrate at the end of the dedication rite. A
    ritual dagger, or athame is the general tool chosen.
    Self-dedication can be very empowering, and can
    produce a feeling of "walking on clouds", and it is
    very important to earth oneself afterwards, and then
    to have a rest from magickal work for a period of
    between a week and a month.

    Simple daily meditation may be practised during this
    period, but avoid intense magickal work. Time is
    needed to assimilate the experience, and the
    dedication process should be undertaken at a time when
    you do not have too much outside stress, and are able
    to take time for yourself.

    It should be stressed that self-dedication is not the
    same as initiation into a coven, and should you wish
    to join a coven at a later date, you would still have
    to go through a probationary period and coven
    initiation, if accepted.
