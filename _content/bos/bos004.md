# Opening (ending) the Circle

The High Priestess goes to each of the four directions in turn and draws
a Banishing Pentacle, saying:

> Guardians of the East (South, West, North),  
> Powers of Air (Fire, Water, Earth), we thank you  
> For joining in our circle  
> And we ask for your blessing  
> As you depart  
> May there be peace between us  
> Now and forever. Blessed be.

She raises her athame to the sky and touches it to the earth, then opens
her arms and says:

> The circle is open, but unbroken,  
> May the peace of the Goddess  
> Go in your hearts,  
> Merry meet, and merry part.  
> And merry meet again. Blessed be.
