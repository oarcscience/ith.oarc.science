                       CELTIC WORKSHOP (Internet)
This is an Upload of the first Celtic Workshop on Druids, Oghams and 
Divination. Each student was supposed to have already downloaded the
Library 16 files Oghamd.txt (A table of Ogham correspondences),
Fionnw.GIF ( A symbollic representation of Oghams in Circles.) and
Ogham.GIF (A picture showing exactly how each tree Ogham symbol looked.)
In additional to these files, messages were posted in the Section 15
message board for Ogham correspondence tables by Nigel Pennick, D.J.
Conway, John Matthews, Murray Hope, Douglas Monroe and Edric Thorsson.
A lot of information is contained in these files and messages and
is essential for fully understanding the workshop and discussion. I 
recommend reading &quot;The Celts&quot; by Nora Chadwick for historical background
on the Celts as a people. I recommend John Matthews book &quot;Celtic
Shamanism&quot; and also Nigel Pennick's book &quot;Magical Alphabets&quot;. More
complete discussions of many of these topics are found in those works.

Due to time constraints, All the prepared material did not get
presented during the Workshop. I have included it here in it's entireity
at the request of the participants and in the interest of completeness.

Before starting the Workshop, we engaged in informal conversation  with
the first topic being the book &quot;Life of a Druid Prince&quot;. Jehana asked 
if I had read this book.

&lt;Start of Workshop&gt;

O'Dubh  : Never read the book
Jehana  : It's basically an archeological/anthropological study of...
          one of those sacrificed humans they pulled out of a peat bog.
SUZAN   : hello Jehana!
Jehana  : with some interesting speculations as well.
          Hello suzan.
          Hail!
O'Dubh  : I saw an article on it with pictures in Scientific American I 
          think.
          Merry Meet Again Maiden!
Jehana  : yes, i think they covered it there, too.
O'Dubh  : looks like UFOs are the talk of the town tonight.
Jehana  : And The Crone greets the Maiden!
SUZAN   : there was a great TLC special on an archeological find like 
          that
Jehana  : suzan is still here.
          suzan?
SUZAN   : geesh! there are 27 people in that room!
O'Dubh  : yes it's a mad house over there
SUZAN   : oh just lurking around a bit sorry :)
O'Dubh  : I didn't get any advertising here.
Jehana  : too busy to stay there. &lt;g&gt;
O'Dubh  : had to do it all myself.
Jehana  : rilla mentioned it to me when i logged in tonight.
O'Dubh  : everytime I log on here I'm bombarded with announcements
          but no Celtic Workshop!:(
          Hi Susan W!!
Jehana  : hey, celtic workshop!!
Susan W.: Hi, just nosey, what's going on?
Jehana  : hello susan...
          odubh is about to do a celtic ../.
          druidic workshop.
3130

O'Dubh  : We're gonna be talking about Celts, Druids and the like
Jehana  : is it workshop or discussion or both?
Susan W.: Maybe I'll listen in for awhile, already been on over anhour.
O'Dubh  : I know how expen$ive it is!&lt;G&gt;
Jehana  : same here.
O'Dubh  : Well I guess I'm gonna start
Susan W.: What can I learn here?
O'Dubh  : You can learn Magick, Shamanism, Oghams, Divination
          But it won't happen overnight.
          Also Druid type stuff.
          There's a lot to cover.
Jehana  : (But it doesn't all require connect time) &lt;g&gt;
O'Dubh  : that's right
          A lot of the files are in the library or message boards
          any way Maybe I should start.
Jehana  : ga
O'Dubh  : I'm going to upload the announcement first so you can see what 
         we'll cover.
Susan W.: great
O'Dubh  : Dia dhuit, a Kheltoi is ni Kheltoi!
          (Hello to all Celts and Non-Celts!)
          We are going to be having on-going Work Shops regarding Celtic 
         Topics of Interest here in the NewAge Forum. I hope to draw
               you Celts and NonCelts alike out of the Groves and into the
               CO's!&lt;G&gt; Time to share some of that Knowledge we've been
               hiding! 
          I plan to touch on the following topics of interest:

                  CLASS #1
                  Druids, Oghams, Divinations
                  CLASS #2 
                  Deities, Shamanism, Magick
                  CLASS #3 
                  History, Warriors, Geneologies (maybe your family         name!)
                  CLASS #4 
                  Languages (Gaeilge, Gaelic, Welsh, Manx,Breton), 
                  Poetry, Prose

          I will basically upload files to the library, prior to the 
          class, to provide a focal point for the discussions and a 
          framework for building a Celtic Book of Shadows. We will 
          flesh these frameworks out through discussions online. I, 
          by no means, have all the answers on matters Celtic. 
          But I truly believe that ALL of us, working together, can 
          approach advance our knowledge and rediscover the True Celtic
               Way.

          Druids are especially welcome to attend so that our Celtic 
          Knowledge may be &quot;Illuminated&quot;!&lt;G&gt; 
          I also hope that The Welsh Bards will grace us with the Songs 
          of Taliesin. 
          
          Other topics will be included based upon the desires and 
          direction of the students and other participants.

          I see the way that the workshops will be conducted as:
Susan W.: ?
3131

O'Dubh  :         Opening Remarks by Me.
                  Presentation by a Speaker (not necessarily me).
                  Questions and Answers.

          Susan W&gt; ga
Susan W.: Oh, sorry, thought my screen was stuck there.  GA
O'Dubh  : OK That was the announcement and sorry if it was wrapping on 
          your screens!&lt;G&gt;
Jehana  : sorry, i do have to go; i will put this workshop on 
          next monday's calendar.
O'Dubh  : I'll continue with the presentation
          Ce'ad Mi'le Failte!  (100,000 Welcomes)
          Welcome to the Celtic Workshop!
          We will be investigating  and sharing our knowledge
          of matters Celtic here. 
          It is my hope that the researches and references 
          I have will add to or compliment your own. 
          I am, by no means, the final authority on 
          these matters. 
          Discussion and interaction, coupled with a
          shamanistic journey or two should fill in
          the gaps and illuminate us all.
          all
Dean    : hello
O'Dubh  : Tonight I hope to lay down a firm framework
          for our knowledge of Druids through a
          discussion of their Magickal writing,
          called Ogham, after Ogma - Sun Face,
          and through a discussion of their divination
          techniques.
          It is commonly thought that the Druids left
          no written records of their work.
          I disagree.
          Many references exist that contain the
          poems of Druids, stories about their Magicks,
          tales of their strategies, their secret lore,
          their Oghams, their invocations, their victories
          and their defeats.
          The major problems with using this information
          is that it is the product of a long
          (tho reliable) oral tradition that was finally
          written down by their antecedents the Culdean
          Monks of the Celtic Church.
          (Probably Druids in hiding).
          Some of the Irish manuscripts 
          used as references on Druids are:
          The Book of Armaugh
          The Book of Ballymote
              (A primary source for Oghams)
          The Tain Bo Cuailgne
3132

          The Book of the Dun Cow
          The Book of Invasions
          The Book of Leinster
          Many references to what Druids did
          are contained within the above books.
          Much of what Celts wrote was symbollic
          of deeper meanings.  Each work can
          be interpreted on many levels.
          In modern times, Druidry is being studied
          by several major groups, ADF and OBVD to
          name just two.
          If we have any Druids present tonight,
          Please come forth and identify yourselves now.
          (well, since only us chickens are here!&lt;g&gt;)
Susan W.: .
O'Dubh  : I'll identify myself as a student of Wicca, Druids and Celts
          Susan W&gt;Whatis your interest or area?
Susan W.: I have no knowledge in this area . .
          I have been told a little bit by a friend.
          The extent  . . .
          is that I understand this Wicca, Druid beliefs,
          are very old and are based on the powers of the earth?
          ga
O'Dubh  : yes the knowledge of Druids/Wiccans is based upon the Earth
and 
          it's power.
          The knowledge of the Oghams is tree knowledge applied as
symbols
          in the use of Magick and Divination.
          I'll upload some info on each symbol
          or group of 5 symbols and show what their
          meanings are.
          The Druids were the shamans of the Celtic
          Clans. They carried the history, the culture 
          and the geneologies of the Clan in their memories.
          To aid in remembering this information,
          Oghams were used, each Ogham being
          associated by its beginning sounds
          with the item to be remembered. This
          is similar to alliteration in today's
          writings.This led to an entire series of
          different types of Oghams.
          Tonight we will discuss tree oghams and Fionn's Wheel.
          Ogham BTW is pronounced &quot;O Wam&quot;.
          It's one of those strange Gaelic things!&lt;G&gt;
          I have listed the Oghams for
          those of you that haven't 
          downloaded the Ogham GIF's
          or the Ogham Divination files
          in Library 16 yet.
          Each Ogham is listed by its
          ancient Gaelic name, then its
          modern Irish name and then its
          Welsh counterpart.
          The first group of 5 is from the
          North on Fionn's Wheel.
          (it is from the Book of Ballymote)
          7th century Irish manuscript.

Susan W.: How would you use this information, for example . . .
          the Native Americans use prayers for certain rituals, such as 
          blessing your surroundings.
          How would you use that infor.?
          Ga
O'Dubh  : The information would be used 
          in divinations and in casting spells.
          It would also be used to mark pathways for Spiritual journeys
          into the Celtic Otherworld.
          The first use of Oghams was on Birch, for instance,
          and it was interpreted by the Irish God Lugh to mean
          that a Magickal attack was going to be made
          upon his wife.
Freepowder: hi all
O'Dubh  : He took precautions.
          Hi Freepowder !! we are underway with our workshop.
Freepowder: I didn;t miss it?
O'Dubh  : I'm just telling Susan how Ogham information was used.
          It's happening right now.
          Anything missed will be in the library.
Freepowder: out standing, but I can't stay long&lt;sigh&gt;
O'Dubh  : Susan&gt;Does that answer your question?
Freepowder: GA
Susan W.: So, he called upon the spirit of the Birch tree to protect 
          him???
O'Dubh  : He used the Magick of the Birch symbol to protect him and
          his wife. Birch was used to surround them and protect them
          from Magickal attack. Lugh's wife was in danger of being
          spirited away to the Underworld.
Freepowder: (sorry) who are we talking about?
Susan W.: Gottcha. :) Difference in interpretation. GA
O'Dubh  : The Celts were also shamanistic just like the Native Americans
          Ok
Susan W.: ?
O'Dubh  : FP&gt;We are talking about the use and meaning of Oghams and 
          symbols of Magick.
          FP&gt;GA
Freepowder: in general?
O'Dubh  : Well I'm presenting the meaning for each Ogham as based upon 
          the information handed down by the Irish Druidic Bards.
Misty   : Can you tell us a little about the shamanistic part of the 
          Celts?
Freepowder: ah!
O'Dubh  : Misty&gt;I will cover that more fully next week but....
          the Celts lived close to nature as did most peoples
O'Dubh  : in the past. They observed that they had to interact with
          it on a more personal basis than we do today.
          I am introducing symbols and diagrams to be
O'Dubh  : used in Magickal journeying.
Misty   : Ok, sounds good!!
Freepowder: O'd&gt; the Celts focused mainly on Trees &amp; shrubs, while the 
          NAIndians,
Freepowder: focused more on animals , right?
O'Dubh  : FP&gt;The Celts tied Oghams to everything...
          Birds, animals, shields, flowers you name it!&lt;G&gt;
Freepowder: !
O'Dubh  : They even had a secret Hand Language&lt;G&gt;!
          GA
3136

Misty   : I've heard of that...how was that used?
Freepowder: &lt;aside&gt; sounds like modern gang!&gt;...
          Ogham was used like runes or tarot?
          ga
O'Dubh  : FP&gt;one of the messages I posted has a direct correllation for
          Oghams and TArot!
Susan W.: ?
Freepowder: I missed it, been a heavy wkend&lt;abashed&gt; GA
O'Dubh  : It's in Section 15.
          Susan &gt;GA
Susan W.: I had someone give me a shamanistic (N.Amer.) style
          drumming experience. ..
          in which I saw the trunk of a very large tree . .
          with a section that you could walk into  . . .
          like the old forest located S. of Yosemite . . . what are
those 
          called again. ?  Anyway GA
          Any meaning to that vision? O'D?
          Sequoia . that's it.
          O'D&gt; GA
SUZAN   : O'D is having some trouble with his connection.......
          he will be right back.....
Susan W.: ok
          I'm probably gonna split in a few . . . been on almost 2hrs.
SUZAN   : thanks for being patient
Susan W.: What are your interests again Suzan?
SUZAN   : i am an astrologer
Freepowder: Suzan&gt; by the look of it we have just got started w/ this, 
          right?
Susan W.: Hi O'D
Freepowder: welcome back O'D
O'Dubh  : Sorry about the line going down!&lt;G&gt;
          Thanks guys!
Freepowder: Mercury is retarded&lt;G&gt;
O'Dubh  : So where were we?
Freepowder: Sequoyah in vision
Susan W.: Did you get I saw trees in a vision?
O'Dubh  : FP!&gt;LOL probably what the prob is!&lt;G&gt;
Freepowder: GA&lt;G&gt;
O'Dubh  : Susan&gt;Yes
Susan W.: Any importance?
O'Dubh  : I was telling how Celts/Druids
          saw all of life interconnected like the Oak limbs
          I believe your vision is telling you 
          to look within yourself to see how
          you connect to the life around you
          perhaps you should go on a shamanistic journey.
Freepowder: ?
O'Dubh  : Discover your inner truths.
          FP&gt; ga
Freepowder: Shamanistic Journey?...
          you mean like a vision quest?
Misty   : Did we lose him again?
O'Dubh  : Yes FP but along definate paths
Susan W.: O'D&gt; celtic style?
O'Dubh  : let me continue and I'll show you the map.
Freepowder: GA
O'Dubh  : Susan&gt;Definately Celtic style if that is what you feel closest
3137

          to.
Susan W.: Actually more N.Amer. style :)
O'Dubh  : Native American style is nice but I am a Celt.
Susan W.: Tell me your way.
O'Dubh  : Watch and see !!
          they (the ways) may be closer than you know!:)
Freepowder: &lt;watching&gt;&lt;G&gt;
O'Dubh  : Ok I'm going to skip the Ogham meanings and go straight to the

          Wheel of the journeys.
          This is Fionn's wheel and is a GIF in Lib 16.
          &lt;now uploading path names&gt;
          Fionn's Wheel is a diagram found in the Book of Ballymote. 
          It shows all 25 Oghams arranged around a series of concentric
          circles (in library 16 as fionnw.gif). This diagram can be 
          used to divine paths necessary for &quot;Pathworking&quot;, a very 
          powerful shamanistic technique. I have identified the meanings
               of each Ogham on the paths (using the correspondences from
               Nigel Pennick mostly). Each Ogham's meaning can require at
               least a workshop of it's own to fully cover. I offer these here to show what can be done with Oghams:
          
          An Roth de an Bealach
          (The Wheel of the Ways)
          ___________________________________
          Each path will be identified with it's Gaeilge/English name 
          and the elements along the Ways.
          
          The Northern Path is first.
          (from outside to inside)
          ___________________________________
          An Cosa'n do Sla'n 
          (The Way of Protection)
          The White Tree of Purity
          The Tree of Life
          The Red Man
          The Moon
          The Keys to the Future
          ___________________________________
          This is the first path on Fionn's wheel
0jim     : hellod
O'Dubh  : It contains the first 5 Oghams B L F S N
jim     : hello
O'Dubh  : This path is first because it teaches the new
          student how to protect him/herself from Magickal harm.
          HELLO jIM
          Please standby
jim     : ok
O'Dubh  : this is a formal Workshop
          But join in !!! 
          Any way, the first step was Purification,
          followed by gaining an ally in &quot;the Red MAn&quot;,
          a being kind of like Coyote in Native American workings.
          The tree of life is there as well
          (this could be what Susan saw in her dream)
          The Moon represents the protection of the Goddess
          When the inner level is reached
          the student gains the keys of knowledge
3138

          but not the wisdom to use them.
          Another journey must be made.
          That is the next path.

          The new beginings
          The festival of Brigit.
Susan W.: !
O'Dubh  : It also requires one to perform such a ritual
          Susan&gt;ga
Susan W.: O'D &amp; all&gt;  sorry, but I gotta go.  Thanks for the info.
jim     : !
O'Dubh  : Susan&gt; ok I'll continue and upload all this into the library.
          B*B
          jim&gt;ga
Susan W.: THanks, I'll check into it.  Bye.
jim     : Thanks for the insight to PAGANISM.  Get out of this stuff!
Freepowder: ?
O'Dubh  : jim&gt;not sure what you mean?
jim     : !
O'Dubh  : jim&gt;ga
jim     : you know! Druids, Pagans, Witches, stuff like that
Misty   : Get out???
jim     : !
Scott   : uh oh.
O'Dubh  : JiM&gt;We are Druids, Pagans, Witches and stuff like that.
jim     : !
O'Dubh  : You are well to listen in to the workshop.
          Jim&gt;standby just a second.
          FP has a question
          FP&gt;ga
Freepowder: I thought Samhain was the beginning of the Celtic year?
          ga
O'Dubh  : FP&gt;It's the begining of the Celtic year but not necessarily
          the begining of the study of Celtic religions.
          ga
Freepowder: ?
O'Dubh  : FP&gt;ga
Freepowder: Imbolc...
          is the start of this path of wisdom?...
          or study on fionn wheel, right?
O'Dubh  : FP&gt;The study of all the major festivals is the second path
          The symbol is actually the Grove.
          The most powerful Magick in the Druid rites
Freepowder: ah!
3139

O'Dubh  : was The victory of life over death,
          the renewal of the wheel of the year,
          the marriage of the Crone to the Oak King or Cernnunos.
          That would not be an appropriate start point for begining
          the study of Druidic Magicks. (Before a student can begin
          Magickal work, the ability to shield and protect oneself
          must first be developed. This is why the first way studied is 
          the way of protection. The next step to performing or learning

          occult wisdom would be in a protected environment, such as rituals or Circles. What better ritual for a fresh start than
               Imbolc which is symbollic of New Beginings and the Quickening
               of Life?  Samhain is actually the end point of the year and
               represents the  culmination of the Druidic Mysteries.

          Jim&gt;I believe you had a question?ga
jim     : not really
O'Dubh  : ok
jim     : just watching and laughing
O'Dubh  : any other questions?
Scott   : ?
Misty   : So are you saying that Winter Solstice is the beginning of 
          the wheel?
O'Dubh  : Jim&gt;I suggest that you watch your behavior

Scott   : ?
O'Dubh  : the next path to aid us in becomming more enlightened is the 
          Eastern path on the wheel.
Misty   : What about my question?  Or did someone beat me to it?
         ********  Answer inserted by O'Dubh  ****************
         (I completely missed Missy's question in all the confusion.   
        The answer to Missy's question is that Samhain is the begining 
          and the ending of the Celtic year. It is the time when the God 
         of the Underworld marries the Crone aspect of the Goddess. The 
         new God or the Sun is not yet reborn until the Winter          Solstice.  The Celts began their days at sundown. It is not surprising that they began their new year with the end of the last harvest.  The period between Samhain and Imbolc is the dark part of the year and is therefore like the night before the day. During this period preparations were made for the onset
of winter and the coming spring planting.)

What follows is the rest of My presentation concerning divination:

O&quot;Dubh  : Western (read Druidic) meditation was usually done 
        for divination and foretelling the future. 
        This was called by the names: Tenm Laida, Dichetal
        Do Chennaib and Imbas Forosna.

        Tenm Laida (Illumination by Song) is an altered state 
        usually achieved by chanting or singing of a repetitive 
        pattern. This can also include drumming and dancing. 
        These activities synchronize the body and mind to
        an external rhythm allowing us to cast off the chains 
        of normal existence.

        This allows one to float at peace within the song 
        (dance, beat, mantra, etc.) This is a strictly Druidic 
        or Shamanistic practice even though it may look like TM.

        Dichetal Do Chennaib (Cracking  open the Nuts of Wisdom) 
        is a state achieved by relaxation and clearing the mind 
        in a Ritual environment. It usually involved using some 
        Magickal implement such as a knife, a sword or a staff 
        to touch a subject (usually upon the head) or involved 
        the handling an item so that the diviner could discover 
        what secret knowledge was contained within it. 
        This information could be events from a person's past life, 
        a detailed history of who and what had happened to an object 
        or how and why the subject was being hexed or spelled. 
        I know this sounds like ESP but it was enhanced through 
        Ritual and relaxation techniques. I believe that Dichetal
        Do Chennaib is the proper state for performing Ogham
        divinations as well. More on this later.

        Imbas Forosna (Illumination) was a form of altered state 
        used by seers and bards to create or see visions. 
        The Druid would be totally isolated from all sensory inputs, 
        sounds, lights and feelings. This was usually a very
        dark room or a covering of hides. The Druid would attempt 
        to float and relax. When in the proper state he/she would 
        signal for the hides to be removed or he/she would open 
        the door out of the Darkness. The sudden, instantaneous 
        transition from Darkness to Light would cause him/her to see 
        visions or to spontaneously utter poems, prophecies or to 
        achieve a total Awareness of the secret Knowledge of 
        their Surroundings. This sensory deprivation forced oneness upon

        them and caused them to become centered and to float. It was 
        their Ultimate Meditation technique.

        The Druids also used music, colors, trees and numbers to alter
        their consciousness. They were familiar with the Pythagorean   
        Mysteries and may have actually been the source of them!&lt;G&gt;

        Druids shared IndoEuropean roots with the Indian Brahmans but
               I don't have any hard data to support any similarities in their practices.


3144

O'Dubh  : To perform an Ogham divination , one must be clear about the
        purpose or object of the divination before begining. Focus this 
        purpose in your mind before starting meditation and/or Circle
        casting. I find that working within a Magickal Circle tends to
        prevent outside psychic influences but don't believe it's 
        absolutely necessary to use a Circle. The form of divination
        is Dichetal Do Chennaib. 
        
        What we will be doing is casting sticks or &quot;fews&quot; upon a casting
        cloth. The sticks are about finger length and size and carved
        with Oghams for each of the 25 symbols. (I prefer to work with
        woods that are the actual symbols used for each Ogham where    
        possible.
        Obviously, some &quot;Crane Bag&quot; symbols are not trees and will have
        to be carved on some neutral wood or other substance, shells or
        rocks for instance. I use Ash or Oak for any substitutions.)
        The casting cloth is a representation of Fionn's Wheel and can
        be multicolored (as in the GIF), plain (Black and White) or just
        drawn on the floor or ground. I like to make the largest Circle
        about my height (in my case 6'2&quot; but use what is suited to you).
        I orient the Wheel with the &quot;B&quot; Ogham to the North. I stand on
        the South side of the Wheel facing North about 3 feet back from
        the &quot;M&quot; Ogham. Place the Oghams in a bag and then randomly     
        select 7 of them. Close your eyes, spin around three times while
        blanking your mind from everything but your purpose. At the end
        of the third spin toss the 7 &quot;fews&quot; into the air about 3 feet
        above your head and towards the center of the Wheel. Once they
        have settled out immediately read the arrangement of the sticks
        as a general impression only. Write this down. Also record the
        relative orientations and postions of the &quot;fews&quot; upon the Wheel.
        Pick up the cast sticks and return them to the bag. Repeat this
        process twice more so that a total of three readings is        
        available.

O'Dubh  :You should now have three Wheel/Ogham Divination charts that 
        have the relative positions of 21 Oghams on them. Interpret the
        Oghams based upon the correspondences I referenced previously.
        (This came from Nigel Pennick's Book &quot;Magical Alphabets&quot; with
        the actual meanings for the Oghams being from the Bardic/Druidic
        traditions as passed dowm by the Clan Bards of the O'Flahertys).
        I use the correspondences that &quot;feel&quot; right to me. You should
        do the same. No one set of correspondences is the absolutely
        right one to use. The above correspondences just hang together
        better in my own mind. The basic technique to reading the tale
        of the sticks is to read then deosil (clockwise) and from the
        outside to the inside. The &quot;fews&quot; towards the center represent 
        the future and those towards the outside the past. Any sticks
        not on the Wheel are ignored. Crossed sticks conflict. Parallel
        sticks compliment or enhance. Sticks laying on Oghams of the
        Wheel have combined effects. The interpretation is not hard and
        fast. I read the symbols as a &quot;story&quot; that is dynamic. I take
        all three divinations together. If they have no correllation at
        all, I ignore the results and try again. Sometimes A divination
        is not possible. I'll try at least three times to get results.
        The relative agreement of each of the Three Wheel/Ogham charts 
        determines the degree of confidence one can have in the
readings, from utter certainty to total confusion! (reminds me of Sex
for some reason but that's another story!&lt;G&gt; I guess the point is that

such Powers and their use are not instantaneous or easy to realize
at times. Sometimes its easy and other times impossible no matter 
how much you try!&lt;G&gt;) This entire process of interpretation is very
similar to: Palmistry, Tarot, Astrology or Runes. They are all basically
taking seemingly random or (at least) uniquely individualized instances
from a person's life and attempting to give meaning to such events based
upon how they relate to Magickal symbols and patterns. What is actually
occurring is that the left brain is gathering facts from the cast
patterns that configure the mind and Spirit to allow the right brain to
make the &quot;Salmon leap&quot; to intuitive insight or Illumination. This is 
Dichetal Do Chennaib or &quot;cracking open the nuts of Wisdom&quot; at its
finest.

        After the divination is finished, dismiss your Circle and fold
or erase your casting Wheel or cloth. Store them separately and away
from normal life until they are to be used again. I recommend a wooden
or cedar chest. Use whatever represents peace, quiet and solitude for
you.

O'Dubh  : So what have we found from this discussion of Druids, Oghams
and divination? We found that Information exists concerning Druid Oghams
in the ancient 7th and 8th century writings of Irish monks-Druids. We
disovered that Fionn's Wheel can be used as a divination casting cloth
and as a &quot;map&quot; for &quot;Pathworking&quot;. We suggested that the Ogham correspon-
dences can identify unique ways to Magickal knowledge and insight.  Most
of this information came from oral Druid histories that were finally
written down in the first millenia by the Druid remnant or Culdean
Monks. I admit that some of my presentation has been colored by my
interests in other forms of MAgick that have more readily available
information, such as Runes, Tarot and Astrology. I have also made every
effort to go to an ancient textural source or, at the very least, to a
modern writer basing their work upon ancient verified Druidic works. In
our future investigations into Druidic practices and Magick, I hope to 
continue using the same techniques to discover or rediscover the
Mysteries of the inner Druidic Knowledge.

       O'Dubhain            | A Workshop is another word for a CO But
since its a WOrkshop it's supposed to be hardere!&lt;G&gt;
       Eric                 | and maismic??
       O'Dubhain            | ANYway
       Falcon               | *maismic*
       O'Dubhain            | The way this works to date is I talk about 
some subjects and we discuss them
                                  | then we maybe come up with some new ideas
       Sue Thornburg        | Sounds terrific. :)
       O'Dubhain            | It runs like a formal CO to begin Just put
in a ? or a !
       Fred McCandless      | so toss out an idea
       O'Dubhain            | If you have a comment or a question
                                  | OK
                                  | First last week
                                  | We talked about Druids Oghams and Divination.
       Fred McCandless      | ?
       O'Dubhain            | I placed a bunch of  files in the library
16 to be used in the workshop.  ok Fred&gt;GA
       Fred McCandless      | si
       O'Dubhain            | Fred&gt; Got a question?
       Wren                 | He's gone, O'd
       O'Dubhain            | anyway the way it works is just like 
3147

that!&lt;G&gt; ok The files give you background on what we discuss.  So the
first question I would ask is....
       Jehana Silverwing    | hi odubh.
                                  | ust 
       O'Dubhain            | Why are we studying these subjects?
                                  | Hi Jehana!
                                  | I mean what are we going to get out of this 
                                  | study?
       Nan                  | cause we like to waste $$ on CI$? &lt;GGG&gt;
       O'Dubhain            | ANyone want to volunteer an opinion?
       Falcon               | !
       O'Dubhain            | Falcon&gt;ga
       Falcon               | I study things because they are there and
I feel I should learn as much as I can
       Nan                  | !
       O'Dubhain            | Me too Falcon!&lt;G&gt;
                                  | Nan&gt;ga
       Nan                  | on a more serious note....I'm interested
in learning about them because they are part of my heritage and the
heritage of those around me
       O'Dubhain            | That's a reason I study them too Nan. When
I asked myself these questions I came up with some answers.  Why study
Oghams?  The answer was because the Druids used them in Magick.
       David Pfeiffer       | To add more to that Nan, being new here,
I'd like to learn more about the history of the natural beliefs because
they may be the only saving grace of this planet.
       O'Dubhain            | They are symbols of Magick.  David&gt; That's
a good one too.
       David Pfeiffer       | Sorry to interrupt. &lt;g&gt;
       O'Dubhain            | The reason I study Magick is just that
that's ok I study Magick of the Earth and of people and of the SPirit to
find the keys to who I am How we relate to each other and to the Planet
       Jehana               | i agree with david.
       O'Dubhain            | This is a time that we are all coming
together to save ourselves and our Planet The ancient Wisdom shows us a
Way to do this Jehana
       O'Dubhain            | We must look within for the Power of
self-awareness For growth and harmony.  The Oghams are the roadsigns on
the Ways to this Wisdom
       David Pfeiffer       | But the whole idea is not for ourselves. 
We are just as important as individuals as a leaf is to a tree.  One
leaf only holds so the tree may live.
       O'Dubhain            | One map of this inner journey is Fionn's
Wheel.  Right again David.  But we must start with ourselves.  To have
a tree one must have leaves. and branches and a trunk and roots as well
as Life.  It's all got to work together.  The purpose of this workshop
tonight is to  determine the way that Fionn's Wheel shows us how to
&quot;Pathwork&quot; to knowledge of ourselves.
       Nan                  | ?
       O'Dubhain            | To show how Druids did this Yes Nan
       Nan                  | i think i know what you mean by &quot;pathwork&quot;
but could you please give a brief definition so that i know we're
thinking the same
       O'Dubhain            | OK. Pathworking is basically an inner
journey to discover Truths within ourselves
       Falcon               | ?
       Nan                  | thanks
       O'Dubhain            | It allows us to tap a &quot;Higher&quot; wisdom To
3148

know our totems and our Spirit guides. Yes Falcon ga.
       Falcon               | What is Finion's Wheel?
       O'Dubhain            | Fionn's Wheel is a representation of the
Oghams laid out in Circles around a center.  Like a Native American
Medicine Wheel.  It is pretty much the same thing for shamanistic
purposes I uploaded a GIF of it into Lib 16 as FIONNW.GIF
       Falcon               | thanks
       O'Dubhain            | On it are the Ogham symbols for our
journey.
       Wren                 | ?
       O'Dubhain            | Each symbol represents an ability or a
knowledge to be gained or understood, Wren ga
       Wren                 | Is there a book with the diagram?  I can't
see GIF's
       O'Dubhain            | It's in the following books: &quot;The Book of
Ogham&quot; by Edred Thorsson, &quot;The Celtic Shaman&quot; by John Matthews
       Jehana               | will capture the gif.
       O'Dubhain            | &quot;The Book of Ballymote&quot; by a 7th century
Culddean Druid&lt;G&gt;, Jehana also in Religion lib.
       Jehana               | okay, odubh.
       Beth Campbell        | send 2 what's Palyne? Is this a formal co?
       O'Dubhain            | yes Beth?  The way Druids worked Magick
was by &quot;becoming&quot; or by actually changing reality A classic example of
this is The Song of Amergin the Druid who aided the Gaels in defeating 
the Tuatha de Danaans.  I quote from his song:
                                  | &quot;I am the wind which breathes upon the sea.
                                  | I am the wave of the ocean.
                                  | I am the murmur of the billows.
                                  | I am the ox of the seven combats.
                                  | I am the vulture upon the rocks.
                                  | I am a beam of the Sun.
                                  | I am the fairest of plants.
                                  | I am a wild boar in valour.
                                  | I am a salmon in the water.
                                  | I am a lake in the plain.
                                  | I am a word of science.
                                  | I am a point of a lance in battle.
                                  | I am the God who created in the head the fire.
                                  | Who is it who throws light into the meeting 
                                  | in the mountain?
                                  | Who announces the ages of the Moon?
                                  | Who teaches the place where couches the Sun?
                                  | If not I?
       Jehana               | I think this song is a teaching ballad.  
       O'Dubhain            | I invoke the land of Ireland!&quot;
       Jehana               | by the way, whose translation is this?  
       O'Dubhain            | Yes it teaches and it invokes the power of
the Land.  This was the translation by Douglas Hyde.
       Jehana               | okay, just simply because it is slightly
different than the one i remembr.
       O'Dubhain            | This Spell was used by the Druid to
overcome the winds raised by the de Danaans in their battle for the
Land.  It is an example of the way a Druid would work.  There are other
tales of shamanistic workings by Druids
       Freepowder           | ?
       O'Dubhain            | Among these is &quot;How the Tain was Recover-
ed&quot; Yes FP?
       Freepowder           | you spoke of becoming, is Amergin actualy
3149

becoming... those things or, has he been in the past?
       Nan                  | or is it a metaphor?
       O'Dubhain            | He is actually synchronizing himself with
the spirit that controls these items.  It is a series of symbols. It can
be viewed metaphorically.  But the fact is it got results.  The wind
died and the Gaels landed on Ireland.
       Freepowder           | ok GA
       O'Dubhain            | Present day shamans do the same thing. 
The story of the Tain was lost and had to be recovered.  It had been
written in Oghams on sticks and sent to Italy.  None of the bards had a
memory of the entire story, so they sent two men to recover the Oghams,
Senchan and Muirgen.  No one knew where to look for these Ogham sticks. 
So Muirgen decided to ask Fergus mac Roich (only one problem---Fergus
was dead) So Muirgen slept on his grave and invoked the ghost of Fergus
to reveal the entire story.  The Spirit of Fergus appeared in a cloud
and for three days recited the entire epic.  Muirgen was able to go back
to the Bards and tell the entire tale.  This tale was written down and
we have it today.  This is an example of dream traveling to discover
hidden knowledge
       Artemisia            | ?
       O'Dubhain            | yes Artemisia?
       Artemisia            | sorry...computer fart
       O'Dubhain            | hahahaha! ok
       Jehana               | &lt;rofl&gt;
       Sue Thornburg        | &lt;snork&gt;
       Freepowder           | &lt;LTB&gt;
       O'Dubhain            | mine was getting constipated!&lt;G&gt;
       Freepowder           | *maismic*
       Jehana               | LTB?  lettuce, tomato and bacon?
       O'Dubhain            | haha!
       Nan                  | lol
       O'Dubhain            | gotta be! &lt;wiping eyes&gt; Anyway the point
is Druids did Magick in a lot of ways that has to be discovered again
from studying these tales.  Native Americans pass this kind of know-
ledge down from teacher to student.  We are not so lucky. We have to dig
it out of books and figure out the symbolisms!
       Sue Thornburg        | Unless we have an O'Dubh and a computer.
:)
       Artemisia            | :-)
       O'Dubhain            | &lt;taking a bow&gt; But not for speed typing!-
&lt;G&gt; or typos!:(To take a Journey on Fionn's Wheel, I suggest One study
the Paths as outlined in Workshop #1 in Library 16 here as CLTWS1.TXT.
       Beth Campbell        | &lt;g&gt; Does this mean ... those who don't
respect the past are doomed to repeat it?
       Jehana               | only if it was a &quot;bad&quot; past &lt;g&gt;.
       Freepowder           | *maismic*
       Sue Thornburg        | &lt;chortle&gt;
       O'Dubhain            | I think we all get our turn in the
&quot;barrel&quot;!&lt;G&gt;
       Jehana               | sorry.
       O'Dubhain            | The first Path according to my inner
vision
       Beth Campbell        | wrong choice of words (sorry) (must be
mercury) going to repeat it
       O'Dubhain            | and as based upon the Oghams in Nigel
Pennicks &quot;Magical Alphabets&quot; is the Way of Protection.  This Way has the
Oghams B L F S N on it from the outside to the center.  Each Ogham on
this Path teaches us a Magickal ability.  The first Ogham B stands for
3150

the tree Birch--The White Tree of Purity and Purification.
       Jehana               | B is birch in the norse runes, too.  
       O'Dubhain            | It is used to protect and Purify us before
we start our journey within.  It was the first Ogham ever used. It
warned Lugh that his wife was going to be abducted to the Underworld and
it will serve to show us that we are protected. Life springs anew.  To
make such a journey one should meditate and cleanse oneself of all
unclean and impure thoughts. 
      Beth Campbell        | (sounds like Eve and the Apple)
       O'Dubhain            | Native Americans might do this in a &quot;sweat
lodge&quot;.  more of a putting away of the mundane bagage of life. baggage
that is !&lt;G&gt;  Make an Out of Body (OOBE) type of Journey to a White tree
shining against a totally Black Darkness.  Use its image to purge your
mind of distracting thoughts and go to the next level ---The Tree of
Life.  Upon this tree one learns to shield unwanted psychic energies and
Magicks. This Ogham is &quot;L&quot; for Rowan. When one is floating in an OOBE
one needs such shielding to travel safely.
       Freepowder           | ?
       O'Dubhain            | The next symbol in our journey is --&quot;The
Red Man&quot;. FP ga
       Freepowder           | sould it be too long to cover their
protection in a bit more detail?
       O'Dubhain            | It would take an entire workshop.
       Freepowder           | thought so, &lt;G&gt; GA
       Artemisia            | :-)
       O'Dubhain            | I'll cover this with a post on the Section
15 message board.
       Nan                  | 15 or 16?
       O'Dubhain            | The Red Man or the Fear Dearg is a
Supernatural being
       Jehana               | how about a library file?
       O'Dubhain            | that is a fire entity. That too Jehana!&lt;G&gt;
He sometimes will rescue us from the Other forces of the Underworld. 
His Ogham is the Alder Tree.  Fp ga
       Freepowder           | the whistle tree!&lt;G&gt;
       O'Dubhain            | Ah!  Perhaps the whistle will lead us from
the Underworld!?&lt;G&gt;
       Fea'dog              | it does me!
       O'Dubhain            | Red is the color of life and frees us from
conflicts and shields us in our lives.  Once we are pure and can shield
and have no inner conflicts, it is time to learn of Magick itself!  The
next step or Ogham is The Moon.  It is the letter &quot;S&quot; for the White
Willow.  This is a form of the Goddess and leads us in Divinations to
guide our future travels on the Wheel.  The last or inner Ogham on this
path is &quot;N&quot;.  It represents the Keys to inner Knowledge that we have
gained.  It is the Black Ash.
       Rachel               | hello
       O'Dubhain            | It also gives us the insight &quot;as Above so
Below&quot;.
       Jehana               | hello.
       Rachel               | what is the subject?
       O'Dubhain            | All our previous insights will aid us in
the physical and the astral worlds.  Rachel, this is a Workshop on
Celtic Magick.  These keys and knowledge must grow like seeds within us. 
In the future, they allow us to work our Power, the Earth's Power and
the Power of the Spirit.  This completes the Way of Protection. I
suggest that each of you try such a journey on your own, in a Circle or
Safe quiet place.  Learn the symbols for the Oghams from the tables in
3151

the library (there are about 7 there I think).  Shamanistic journeys are
very individualized.  Use symbols that have meaning to You.  To complete
the journey around Fionns Wheel would cover the entire year and the
Major festivals. 
       Nan                  | is that the next workshop, the festivals?
&lt;g&gt;
       O'Dubhain            | Really project yourselves into the Wheel
and you will find your own inner guide and Truth.
       Beth Campbell        | (sorry)
       O'Dubhain            | Nan&gt;I think that'd be a good one The Major
festivals are Imbolc Beltane Lughnasadh Samhain The Solstices and the
Equinoxes Each of these can be found on the Wheel.  I hope that I wasn't
too sketchy on this!&lt;G&gt;
       Nan                  | this medium is a bit slow and time
consuming to cover this kind of stuff
       O'Dubhain            | I know my typing can stand improvement.
       Artemisia            | You were very good...&lt;sigh&gt; but I don't
think I'm ever going to get this. 
       O'Dubhain            | John Matthews covers shamanism fully in
his Book
       Nan                  | can you pre-type any and use cut and
paste, that might help
       O'Dubhain            | &quot;Celtic Shamanism&quot;. I could but then we
lose spontaneity and dialogue.
       Nan                  | we could still be spontaneous in the
discussion, but the information portion we're all being quiet anyway
       O'Dubhain            | Hey!  Ok! Next time lends itself to
uploading on the festivals. &lt;g&gt;  I would like you each to consider
making a shamanistic journey and messaging me about it.
       Pietra               | ?
       O'Dubhain            | You might be surprised about what you
find. Pietra ga
       Rachel               | I have a ?
       Pietra               | Is this in part where the Masonic orders
&quot;get their symbolism? I noticed a lot of simularities
       O'Dubhain            | Not sure.  Not a Mason, but I wouldn't be
surprised.  I'll ask around.  &lt;that's my homework&gt;
       Falcon               | ?
       O'Dubhain            | Rachel ga ok Falcon ga
       Falcon               | What is a Mason?
       O'Dubhain            | Any answers from the group?

       Artemisia            | The masons did a consecration of a
washington d.c. monunment
       Beth Campbell        | The masons were the brick layers 
       Artemisia            | and used the earth-air-fire-water symbols
as part of consecrating the cornerstone

hiding in there!?
       Artemisia            | I wouldn't doubt it!
       Pietra               | They would say so
       Artemisia            | it seems like they take from several
traditions
       O'Dubhain            | Some of these societies formed about the
same time as a rebirth of interest in the occult and Druids.
       Pietra               | It is interesting that along with some of
the rest of us the inquisistion tortured and put to death all Masons
they could find.
       O'Dubhain            | Might have members in both paths.
       Artemisia            | hmmmm
       Pietra               | they certainly do --I am one
       O'Dubhain            | Sounds like they were intent on eliminat-
ing anyone that thought for themselves.  Might have to talk to my uncles
about this.  They are Masons.  But those guys are very secretive ! Just
like Druids!&lt;G&gt;
       Pietra               | Oh good
       Artemisia            | Yes, they are &lt;G&gt;

CELTIC WORKSHOP 3 - CELTIC FESTIVALS

This an edited transcript of the Third Celtic Workshop presented by
Searles O'Dubhain. The topic for the evening was scheduled to be
the Major Celtic yearly festivals and their hidden meanings. Oghams
were used to attempt to discovery the magick and Mystery within each
festival.

(2-9,Bianca)    hi jehana 
(2-7,O'Dubhain) The Celts celebrated 8 major festivals during the year.
Four of these festivals are associated with the Sun and four are tied to
the phases of the Moon.
 
I will briefly discuss the Lunar or Fire Festivals first.
 
The Celtic year is divided into halves marked by the two great fire
festivals of Samhain and Beltane. The period from Samhain to Beltain
is(2-9,Bianca) sid and mindy called &quot;an Ghrian beag&quot; or the &quot;lessor
Sun&quot;.  The period from Beltain to Samhain is called &quot;an Ghrian mor&quot; or
the &quot;greater Sun&quot;. The year is further subdivided by the other two
yearly fire festivals of Imbolc and Lughnesadh.All of the fire festivals
are celebrated at night and are held during the Full Moon. They are
primarily concerned with agriculture, nature, pasturing and livestock. 
 
(2-1,Freepowder)?  
                
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Samhain is the begining of the Celtic year and marks the
time of the Cailleach and the begining of Winter. The doors of the Sidhe
are opened on this night and the veil between the Worlds is thinnest.
This is the night that Druids offered sacrifices (usually the excess
cattle that would form the basis of the Winter's meat stores). This is
the time that the Ancestors walk the Earth once more and cross the thin
veil to visit with the living. Samhain is associated with the province
of Munster and the fortress of Tlachtga.
                 
Beltane marks the begining of Summer and is dedicated to the &quot;Shining
One:&quot; or Bel. Two large bonfires were ignited and cattle were driven
between the fires and into the fields for Summer pasturing. This was
also done to purify them from their long Winter confinement. Men and
women were known to leap through the flames for purification at these
fire festivals.  Usually the men first then the women (and after the
flames had diminished!&lt;g&gt;).  This night is the time when the Sidhe walk 
the land and mortals must overcome their Otherworldly enchantments and
temptations.   Beltane was the time when divorces were granted in
Ireland as well as a night of release from the Winter. This festival was
3156

associated with the province of Connacht and the fortress of Uisneach.
 
In ancient Ireland an additional two fire festivals were celebrated:
Lughnasadh and the feast of Tara (celebrated every 3 years).
 
Lughnasadh was the time of the first harvest and a time of games and
competitions. It is associated with the Goddess of Sovereignty.  The God
Lugh held this festival to celibrate the efforts of his fostermother
Tailtiu to clear the fields of Ireland for planting.  It was also the
time when couples could enter into a &quot;trial marriage&quot; known as a Brehon 
wedding. The couple would clasp hands and thrust them through a circular
opening in a special stone, while announcing to the Brehons (judges and
lawyers) that they intended to live together for a one year trial
period. Either party could break the marriage by a public announcement
during the feast of Beltane. This festival lasted for a month! The feast
of Tara was held every three years to distribute laws and gather
records.
 
An additional festival was added later.  This is Imbolc and was held in
Leinster to celebrate the Goddess Brigit. This festival marks the ending
of Winter's grip and the passing of the influence of the Crone or
Cailleach to the Maiden of Spring. It is the time of the first lambs and
of new beginings. Brigit's sacred flame was tended in Leinster in a
sacred center for female Druids. This festival was usually one of the
home and the hearth and was usually presided  over by the female head of
the house.
 
The Sun festivals are MidWinter and MidSummer Solstices as well as the
Spring and Vernal Equinoxes. These festivals mark periods of greatest
imbalance between the Sun and the Moon as well as the periods of
greatest balance. Not much is known about how these Sun festivals were
celebrated by the Celts, if at all. One source I've read claims they 
are evidence of Anglo-Saxon influences on later Celtic life and
practice. Most authors state that only the lunar festivals were publicly
celebrated (at least by the Irish).  Perhaps the Druids used the Solar
days for Magick and Divination. I am still researching these celebrat-
ions and am not prepared to discuss them in detail this evening.
 
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Perhaps we should discuss the previous presentation
before we get to the Magickal meaning of the Lunar festivals?
 
FP&gt;ga
(2-1,Freepowder)you answered it &lt;G&gt;
(2-7,O'Dubhain)  Ok I know this was a long spiel but now we can discuss
it.
     The following pieces are much shorter with more room for discussion
(2-1,Freepowder)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain)  FP&gt;ga
(2-29,Nan)       ?
(2-1,Freepowder)the festivals I have herard of samhain etc. are solar?
(2-1,Freepowder)but not agreed upon?
(2-7,O'Dubhain)  The Solar festivals are not really ancient Celtic
public festivals.
(2-1,Freepowder)GA
(2-3,Pietra)     !
(2-7,O'Dubhain)  Samhain is a lunar festival.  But More research must be
done on the Solar festivals. ga FP
(2-17,Kenneth 23)Are the Solar festivals mentioned at all in Greek or

Roman chronicles as Celtic festival days?
(2-7,O'Dubhain)  Kenneth &gt;Will get to that question in a minute.
                 Fp&gt;done?
(2-1,Freepowder)GA
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Nan&gt;ga
(2-29,Nan)      two questions, how are the lunar holidays determined
(dates) and what is the connection of 
(2-29,Nan)      the Sidhe with Beltane?
(2-29,Nan)      ga
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Nan&gt;I'll answer those in the following presentation.
Pietra&gt;ga       ok
(2-3,Pietra)    didn't the people also jump the bonfires?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Pietra&gt;Yes they did. And sometimes they were sacrificed
in them But that was very long ago.  The Human sacrifice was replaced by
animal and agricultural sacrifices.
Kenneth&gt;The Romans influenced the Britains and also the Vikings and
Anglo-Saxons  This is where the Sun festivals come from although they
could have been Druid ceremonies closed to the public.
Kenneth&gt;ga
(2-17,Kenneth 23)Hmmm...I see.  So as far as readily evident public
festival information goes, 
(2-17,Kenneth 23)the Solar festivals are recent -- at least in the sense
of &quot;post-Roman?&quot;
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth&gt;Yes I believe so. These festivals are part of
the Wiccan year.  Because Wicca embraces soo many diff backgrounds and
deities.  anyway I'm going to talk a little about the Magickal sig-
nificance of these holidays and festivals now.  We will use the Oghams
from Fionn's Wheel to get an inkling of what was really going on during
these festivals.  Any other questions before I start?

ok From the &quot;Crane Bag&quot; of Mannanan mac Lyr The Festival of Imbolc
(First Full Moon in Aquarius) The Feast of the Goddess Brigit.
 
                Ogham Symbol &quot;EA&quot;:
                Koad or Eadha the Sacred Grove
                Death (Tarot).
                Unity of the Eight Festivals of the Year.
                The Wheel of the Year.
                forty shades of green.
 
 
                Interpretation and Meanings:
 
     This is the festival of new beginings.  This is the time when most
new life came forth (first shoots of spring, lambs and the childern that
were sired at Beltain).  A celebration of the Triple Goddess, showing
the passage of winter and the advent of summer. The Time of the Maiden
who bridges the gap from the Dark Queen of the UnderWorld to the Red
Mother of Life and Plenty.  The Mystery here is the unity of Death and
Life through the Promise of the rebirth of the Green World as represen-
ted by Brigit, the Maiden of the hearth, the home, poets and the forge.
Imbolc is the time of divination, augury and seeking of new directions
for the year.  I believe that Imbolc is a carry over from an earlier
Goddess religion in Ireland.
                Discussion or questions anyone?
(2-1,Freepowder)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) FP&gt;ga
(2-1,Freepowder)Brigit did poets, who did musicians? &lt;G&gt;
3158

(2-1,Freepowder)GA
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Well the Dagdha played a mean harp.  And Lugh was
multi-talented.
(2-1,Freepowder)LOL 
(2-1,Freepowder)no &quot;patron saint&quot; of musicians?
(2-1,Freepowder)GA
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Well Taliesin was the king of Bards And was the greatest
of musicians as well.  So he would be your God of Musicians.
(2-1,Freepowder)he was welsh! Amergin maybe? &lt;G&gt; 
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Amergin was also a great bard.  He seems to be Talies-
in's counterpart.  Ok on to Betaine!
     From the &quot;Crane Bag&quot; of Mannanan mac Lyr The Festival of Beltain
(First Full Moon after the Hawthorne's bloom)  The Feast of Bel and the
twin bonfires.
 
                Ogham Symbol &quot;OI&quot;:
                Oir Spi'ona'n Eirinen Fair.
                Childbirth.
                The Spindle of the Wheel.
                White or Red.
 
                Interpretation and Meanings:
 
This is the festival of life. On this day, the sacred fires were lit on
the hill of Tara. Fires were lit on hills across Ireland when the signal
fire was observed until the land was surrounded in a circle of fire.
Beltain marks the begining of summer when the land is filled with
plenty. This a time when the ways between the worlds are open and the
Sidhe are most likely to grant gifts to those who seek them early in the 
morning. It is also a time that is central to the entire cycle of
agriculture. It is now when the promise of spring is fulfilled. The
Maypole symbolises the fertility rites of this festival. Strange that
the red and white streamers of the Maypole should remind us of the DNA
Helix of Life. Life is the Spindle and Love is the weave. In Ireland
the people dance around a burning bush in a &quot;serpent&quot; dance. Beltaine is
the time of our maturity and the fulfillment of desires.
 
                Questions or should I go on?
(2-1,Freepowder)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) FP&gt;ga
(2-1,Freepowder)Bel was the god of the dead?...
(2-1,Freepowder)and this was a festival of life? GA
(2-1,Freepowder)&lt;G&gt; Ok
(2-7,O'Dubhain) There is controversy over whether Belenus is really the
God for whom this festival is named.  But Belenus, Bael, Bile and Beil
are all names associted with this festival. Some of theses are Sun Gods
eg &quot;Shining Ones&quot; Irish sources say this that Beltaine really means
Great Fires!&lt;G&gt;
(2-29,Nan)      ?  Nan&gt;ga
(2-5,JUAN)      HELLO EVERYBODY
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Juan Standby please Co in progress
(2-29,Nan)      what if there's no Hawthorn around? how do you know when
this festival is?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Nan&gt;It's commonly called May Day in Western Europe.
That's May 1 or the closet Full Moon to May 1.
(2-29,Nan) ok
(2-7,O'Dubhain) That's the first full moon in Taurus.
(2-17,Kenneth 23)?
3159

(2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth&gt;ga
(2-17,Kenneth 23)Beltane seems to be characterized by masculine symbols
-- was it a special day for men, such as entrance to manhood festivals,
or such?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth&gt;It was a day of festivities for both men and
women It's also associated with the first Battle of Moytura.  Women and
men both fought in that battle.
(2-17,Kenneth 23)&lt;nod&gt; Was there any particular ascent to adulthood
ritual in Celtic festivities?
(2-17,Kenneth 23)I see...
(2-7,O'Dubhain) All the festivals were used as rites of initiation since
this was a time of gathering of the clans.  many times a boy would be
initiated by graduating from warrior training or bardic training he
could then demonstrate his prowess.  
(2-17,Kenneth 23)Ah...I see.  So anything involving community could be
done on those days (including Bhar Mitzvas :D)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Something like that! and also lots of games and
competitions.

(2-7,O'Dubhain) Pressing on  here From the &quot;Crane Bag&quot; of Mannanan mac
Lyr
 
 
                The Festival of Lughnasadh
                (First Full Moon in Leo)
                The Feast of the God Lugh.
 
                Ogham Symbol &quot;UI&quot;:
                Uinllean Fea' Ffawyddean Beech or Phagos.
                Chieftain.
                Magickal Hardness and Resistance.
                Ancient Wisdom as a foundation.
                Tawny or light roebuck.
 
                Interpretation and Meanings:
 
This festival is linked to many ancient practices in Ireland. Contracts,
marriages and other binding agreements were made on this day. This is
the day of the Marriage of Lugh. It is also the day when the performance
of the clan chiefs was evaluated and perhaps a new chief was chosen.
This is the time of the great horse fair and fittingly enough the
marriage of the King to the land. This could sometimes involve a ritual
whereby the new king was symbollically mated with a horse, Symbolizing
the Goddess of Sovereignty. The first harvest had already been reaped.
 
                Ogham Symbol &quot;IO&quot;:
                Pethbol Guelder Rose
                The step into the Inner Mysteries.
                Pink or Pale.
                The dance of life.
                The Crane Dance.
 
                Interpretation and Meanings:
 
Since this festival is linked to the young god Lugh that replaces the
older god Nuada, it is also linked to the mysteries as Lugh is &quot;Samil-
danach&quot; or &quot;multi-talented&quot;. It is very possible that a series of
examinations was given to Druidic students on this day, corresponding to
3160

the series of tests that Lugh had to pass in competitions with the other
Gods before he was admitted to their company. One such contest is in the
throwing of stones or chariot wheels that occurred during the weeks of
this fair. Another is the playing of board games at this time such as
&quot;fidchell&quot;, a game played with wooden pieces (possibly Oghams) and
similar we are told to chess. My own opinion is that it was a kind of
divination. The point here being that just as Lugh proved himself worthy
to join the company of the Gods by being &quot;Samildanach&quot;, so I interpret
this symbol to imply that new Druids were admitted to the  inner
mysteries and Circles by passing their tests during this festival.
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Questions?
(2-17,Kenneth 23)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth!&gt;ga
(2-17,Kenneth 23)Sorry...just one little thing I've always wondered --
Fidchell, and games like it in other celtic groups, are mentioned
frequently in literature and legend.  Are there any surviving fidchell
sets?  How is information known about the game?

(2-7,O'Dubhain) Kenneth&gt;Not much is known about the game.  No sets
survive but it must have been something!  Everyone was playing it!&lt;G&gt;
more? ga
(2-17,Kenneth 23)No...that's all, thanks!
(2-1,Freepowder)O'D? GA
(2-7,O'Dubhain) ok

                From the &quot;Crane Bag&quot; of Mannanan mac Lyr
 
 
                The Festival of Samhain
                (First Full Moon in Scorpio)
                Ogham Symbol &quot;AE&quot;:
                Amancholl, Mor, Xi, Pe'ine, The Scotch Pine.
                Shower of the Way.
                Marker of the Ley Lines.
                Bringer of Illumination.
                The Container of Wisdom,
                The Sacred Pine Cone, Buarci'n.
                Spirit.
                The Sea. Green or Black.
 
 
                Interpretation and Meanings:
 
There are many meanings to this symbol. The first is the Sea represen-
ting the darkest depths and also the source of all life.  The mystery
here is that as life ends, so it begins in the same place and from the
same source, the Sea (or Otherworld for which it is a symbol).  This
celebration honored the Night of the Dead, when the ancestors walked the
Earth once more and the ancient knowledge could be re-acquired.  It also
celebrated the mating of the Dagdha with the Morrigan, the Queen of
Death and Darkness, the Washer at the Ford. She gives the Dagdha the 
advice to assemble the Aes Dana or skilled ones and to advance upon the
Fomorians at Maige Turedh. The Goddess of War then goes to kill the King
of the Fomorians (Indech mac De Domnann) in his tent at Scetne. The
Second Battle of Maige Turedh (Moytura) is won by the De Danaans on
Samhain.  I interpret this story of the Dagdha (The All Father)with the
Goddess of Darkness (The Triple Morrigan) to mean that the will of the
One was united in the Power of Dark and Light to be used during this
3161

&quot;gray time&quot; of twilight. The Spiritual aspects overcome the Mental and
Physical aspects (the Fomorians and  the Firbolgs, defeated in the first
Battle of Maige Turedh) to claim the Land and ALL that is. The victory
of the Spirit assures us that the Wheel will turn eternally and that the
three aspects of humanity are forged together through the two battles of
Maige Turedh. Please read Steve Blamires's excellent interpretations in
his work &quot;The Irish Celtic Magical Tradition&quot;. This last marriage of the
Dagdha and Morrigan also represents the mystery of life from death. 
I believe that to be the Ultimate Mystery of Druidism or any other
religion.
(2-7,O'Dubhain) questions?
(2-1,Freepowder)?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Fp&gt;ga
(2-1,Freepowder)did the Irish believe in reincarnation? GA
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Yes they did. They believed that when you were re-incar-
nated, it would hold true to the bloodlines.  Like maybe you are your
great grandfather or grand mother re-incarnated!&lt;G&gt;
(2-1,Freepowder)not &quot;karmic&quot; then?
(2-7,O'Dubhain) Not a great deal of karma there.  They did hold each
accountable for their life's actions.  
(2-1,Freepowder)what about if you are adopted? &lt;VBG&gt;
(2-7,O'Dubhain) he Irish also believed in &quot;fosterage&quot; so that you became
&quot;blood brothers&quot;.  So I suppose you could re-incarnate in someone else
that way!&lt;G&gt;
(2-1,Freepowder)LOL
(2-7,O'Dubhain) yep.

                   CELTIC WORKSHOP #4 - CELTIC MUSIC 

This an edited transcript of the fOURTH Celtic Workshop presented by
Searles  O'Dubhain. The topic for the evening was scheduled to be
Celtic Music and Magick in general, the Role of Bards and Druids in 
Celtic Music, the Music Ogham - Aradach Fionn, Tree tones and their 
musical associations and some example folk songs and their interpreta-
tions.

(2-11,Nan)   cough cough
(2-8,O'Dubh) Ok let's get started!
(2-11,Nan)  &lt;ptuie&gt; 'scuse me &lt;g&gt;
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) Before I begin let me say a few words about how the
Workshop is conducted.  We will first hear from a presenter, tonight
that is me. If you have a question type in a ? and I will acknowledge
you by tyoing &quot;ga&quot; at and appropriate time.  When you have finished your
question type &quot;ga&quot; to let me know that I may respond. When
we are finished I will acknowledge the next questioner in a similar
manner. If you have a comment or additional information to provide
on a topic, please use the &quot;!&quot; to signal me.  I will also cycle through
those with comments in a similar manner. If their are no questions at
this point I will begin tonight's presentation.
(2-5,Seanchai) ?
(2-8,O'Dubh) The topics I plan to cover tonight are:
 
3165

                Music and Magick in general.
                Role of Bards and Druids in Celtic Music.
                Aradach Fionn, Tree tones and associations
                Some example folk songs and interpretations.
(2-8,O'Dubh)   Seanchai ga.
(2-5,Seanchai) Patience is a virtue I need to learn in a hurry.
(2-5,Seanchai) I was going to ask, what's tonight's topic.
(2-8,O'Dubh)   ok !&lt;G&gt;
(2-5,Seanchai) Ga
(2-20,O'Ba'n)  LOL!
(2-11,Nan)     lol
(2-9,Rose)     ditto

(2-8,O'Dubh) Anyone that has ever done Magick knows that it involves
resonances and associations.  Magick has many color associations as well
as musical associations. We have all experienced the magick of music in
contemporary music. Sometimes this can be in the form of attending
a concert, othertimes it can be when we are alone and listening to our
favorites tunes.  Modern day religious services take advantage of the
Magick inherit to music to enhance their worship services. This can be
in singing hymns or hearing organ and choral anthems. I'm sure that we
will all agree that music in such sitruarions alters our state of being.
We are uplifted and changed by the ritual music we experience.  It
should be no surprise that the ancient Celts used music in a similar
manner.  In Morgan Llwellyn's &quot;Druids&quot; we find an example of such a
Druidic use of music in Magick.  The chief Druid of a village would
greet the Sun with song and lead the village each day in welcoming the
Sun back from the Underworld.  When the Sun set, another farewell song
was enjoined. This practice is still followed by some in Celtic lands to
this day. Examples of such incantations and greetings to the Sun
may be found in the &quot;Carmenica Gadetica&quot; a vast resources of ancient and
rercent Celtic verse and song.
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) Please pardon the typos!&lt;G&gt;  In many Magick systems, Words
of Power using the names of the Gods are used to create resonances
within the Magical Circle so that the Magicians may attain a higher
state of awareness. The use of these words also serves to open the
internal &quot;Power Centers&quot; or &quot;Chakras&quot; of the participants.  These
godnames are constructed using the letters of the Magickal alphabets of
the respective Magickal systems as well as the natural tones  and the
corresponding resonances that are associated with each letter or symbol.
             For example:
        
                YHVH Yud Heh Vahv He  
                (a Kaballistic godname)
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) An incantaion of a godname becomes a chant with its own
inherent melody and rhythm. Such sounds generated form an occult
alphabet are thought by Magicians to have inherit Power in their sounds
and to generate Magickal resonances within the Magician and the Circle.
It is my belief that the ancient Celts and Druids used music and sounds
from their secret Ogham alphabet to aid them in working Magick in a
similar manner.  
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) Druidic Bards studied for 15 to 20 years to learn the
epics, chants, spells and histories of their peoples and clans. These
works were memorized exactly and were a requirement for advancement to
a higher or inner level of the Druidic ranks. The works had to be 
3166

rendered with feeling so that the listener  would be spell bound and
consequently could relive the event.  The Irish Druids had the following
classes of Bards:
 
                 Class          # of Epics
                 __________________________________________ 
 
                 Driseg         20   (the Beginner)
                 Foclaic        30   (Advanced beginner)
                 Cili           100  (Journeyman)
                 Anraid         175  (Master/Warrior)
                 Ollomh         175+ (Doctor/Judge)
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) Bards learned to play the pipes, the whistle, the harp, the
lyre, the flute, the sistrum and the bodrun among other instruments.
According to Murry Hope these instruments, were used based upon the mood
or tone that the particular Bardic work required. He gives a table of
the following correspondences:
        
                    The Flute   -  Air   (later the Organ)
                    The Harp    -  Water
                    The Sistrum -  Earth (The Bells or Bodrun)
                    The Lyre    -  Fire
 
Poets and Bards carried branches with bells and amulets attached to
them. A beginner's branch would be bronze, journeymen carried a silver
branch and the Master Bards carried a golden branch. The music of the
bells would announce the Bard's presence and an impending performance.
(2-8,O'Dubh) Nan ga
(2-11,Nan)   what's a sistrum?
(2-11,Nan)   ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) It's a stringed instrument that one beats I believe. 
Anyone got an opinion?
(2-2,Rilla)  Ray confirms that.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) ?
(2-2,Rilla)  Precursor of the lute maybe?
(2-8,O'Dubh) perhaps.
(2-9,Rose)   I understand that one shakes it like Isis does in the
pictures.
(2-22,Wren)  Similar to a hammered dulcimer?
(2-8,O'Dubh) That's what I was thinking, Wren.
(2-11,Nan)   or a tambourine?
(2-9,Rose)   I have a picture of one...
(2-8,O'Dubh) Rose ga
(2-9,Rose)   it looks like a tennis racket.
(2-9,Rose)   with hooks.
(2-8,O'Dubh) And you beat it right?
(2-9,Rose)   I think so.
(2-8,O'Dubh) ok Nan any further questions?
(2-11,Nan)   got it, thanks
(2-9,Rose)   shake it.
(2-20,O'Ba'n)an ancient metal frame with numerous metal rods that jingle
when shaken, websters.
(2-9,Rose)   bravo.
(2-8,O'Dubh) great! 
(2-20,O'Ba'n) ?
(2-11,Nan)    no, ga
(2-8,O'Dubh)  O'ba'n?
3167

(2-8,O'Dubh)  ok let's roll!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) wait
(2-8,O'Dubh)  O'ban ga!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) are the instruments dedicated to...
(2-20,O'Ba'n) their various areas based on the tonal range they cover
or...
(2-20,O'Ba'n) the quality of the sound?
(2-20,O'Ba'n) ga
(2-8,O'Dubh)  It's the quality of the sound mostly.  The same way they
would be scored in an orchestra for instance.  
(2-20,O'Ba'n) ok.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) ga
(2-8,O'Dubh)  ga
(2-20,O'Ba'n) no, you ga!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) &lt;G&gt;|
(2-8,O'Dubh) My own belief is that the Bards usually accompanied
themselves with the harp as they recited their repertorie. Just as
Oghams were used as keys to memory with verses being linked by assonance
and alliteration, I believe that each Ogham had a unique tone or note
associated with it on the harp.  The tone or string was struck as the
Ogham sound was spoken or sung two notes per line.  The begining and
ending notes serving to connect each line to the next line in a
continuing stream.  In the world of my my imagination I can hear the
tones and words of the Bards echoing as they float upon a wave of melody
acroos the room.  The sound reminds me of chanting monks or the 
plainsong of worship (similar to modern Anglican or Roman Catholic
Plainsong).
(2-8,O'Dubh) Sean O'Boyle, a late Irish scholar, made an attempt to
interpret &quot;Aradach Fionn&quot; (Fionn's Ladder) as harp tabulature using
Oghams. He suggested that the Irish practice harp that has only 20
strings has a 1 to 1 correspondence to the first 20 Oghams. As far as I
know,no records survived to reach us verifying his theory. It seems to
make sense to me but I only speculate.
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) A modern work &quot;Trees for Healing&quot; by Chase and Pawlik,
reinforces this belief for me. This book is all about trees, their lore
and their spirits. It describes techniques for meditation to determine
the harmonic resonaces for a variety of trees. I believe that the
ancient Druids also detected certain harmonic tones for each tree and
used then in their Tree Ogham Alphabet. If we use the tones that have
been rediscovered by Chase and Pawlik and combine them with the ancient
chants, incantations and songs of Taliesin and Amergin, we may also be
able to work powerful Magicks. This Magick can take any form from
enchanting an audience to calling the winds.  The Greek Bard Orpheus was
able to walk between the worlds in this manner and so can we.  I list
the trees and the derived modern tonal correspondences below:

(2-8,O'Dubh) Some of these tones were derived by meditation and
resonance, some are based upon the colors associated with the Oghams. My
suggestion is to
(2-11,Nan)   ?
(2-8,O'Dubh) find such a tree yourself and to meditate under it. play a
pipe, a whistle or a harp (even a guitar will do in a pinch!&lt;G&gt;) until
you find 
(2-22,Wren)  ?
(2-20,O'Ba'n)?
3169

             the correct tone for the tree.  Other tones will reflect
from the tree.  The &quot;soul tone&quot; of the tree will be absorbed and you
will possibly feel a tingle of energy that is released by the Spirit of
the Tree.  This experience is somewhat akin to the common belief in
Ireland (even today) that a particularily gifted musician, harper or
piper has been taught by the Sidhe (famed for their enchanted music).
Celts believe in harmony and rightness in all things and particularily
in Nature.
(2-8,O'Dubh) Nan ga
(2-11,Nan)   I noticed that many different oghams had the same note...
are these the same notes or are they in differing octaves? ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) The table I presented is not cast in stone!&lt;G&gt;
(2-11,Nan)   or even in wood? &lt;G&gt; 
(2-8,O'Dubh) The first approach has each ogham on a different tone For
Fionn's ladder for instance.  The second approach used meditation
techniques to determine the &quot;soul tones&quot; of the trees Some trees
evidently have a similar feel to them.  I think that the table needs
some work myself.  Perhaps one of the more musically gifted members
could undertake such a study!
(2-24,da Medic) ?
(2-8,O'Dubh) ?&lt;G&gt;
(2-8,O'Dubh) ga Nan
(2-8,O'Dubh) additional questions?
(2-8,O'Dubh) If not then Wren was next.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) !
(2-11,Nan)   no, i think wren had some though
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Wren ga
(2-22,Wren)   Already answered, thanks.  Gotta go, g'nite!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Sla'n Wren!
(2-11,Nan)    g'night wren
(2-8,O'Dubh)  O'ba'n ga
(2-20,O'Ba'n) need to have the transmogrification of what tree is which
out west for me to do it...
(2-20,O'Ba'n) but with that I'd love to do the tree/tone thing!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Ok I'll put a table in the library this week.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) GA
(2-24,da Medic) does this explain the prevalence of willow/oak in celtic
magicks?  ga.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) Cool!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  da Medic ga
(2-24,da Medic) sorry, saw the ga.
(2-8,O'Dubh) Yes it does to some extent.  I have entire books on nothing
but healing properties of trees.  I'm sure Druids knew much more.
(2-11,Nan) ?
(2-8,O'Dubh) Nan ga
(2-11,Nan)   could you please post a bibliography of some of those
books??? (pretty please?)
(2-11,Nan)   ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) Ok will do that as well this week!&lt;G&gt;
(2-20,O'Ba'n) yes! yes!

(2-8,O'Dubh) Now to continue...
             Some of this Magick comes down to us today in the form of
folk songs still sung in the outer reaches of Ireland and the British
Isles.  Such a song is the &quot;Padstow May Song&quot; from  Padstow, Cornwall
(in part):
 

3170

                &quot;Unite and unite and let us unite
                For summer is acome unto day
                And whither we are going we will all unite
                In the merry morning of May.&quot;
 
                &quot;I warn you young men everyone
                To go into the greenwood and 
                fetch your May home.&quot;
 
                &quot;Arise up Mr. _______ and joy you betide
                And bright is your bride that lies 
                by your side.&quot;
 
                &quot;Arise up Mrs. _______ and gold be your ring
                And give to us a cup of ale the merrier 
                we shall sing.&quot;
 
                &quot;Arise up Miss ______ all in your gown of green
                You are as fine a lady as wait upon the Queen.&quot;
 
                &quot;Now fare you well, and we bid you 
                all good cheer

                We call once more unto your house 
                before another year.&quot;

(2-8,O'Dubh) I interpret this song to mean this:
 
             This song is sung on Beltaine and is said to 
             charge the atmosphere of the festival. It 
             symbolizes the marriage of the youth with
             the land. (Unite and unite and let us unite)
 
             It also adresses 3 individuals: A man, a
             woman and a Maiden in a green gown
             (who represents Nature).
 
             This song is sung around the May Pole or   
             May bonfires in the evening (and prior to
             anyone escaping to the outer folds of 
             darkness for an evening of bliss &lt;g&gt;).

................................................................................
3171

(2-8,O'Dubh) Another ancient folk song that has hidden meanings of
Magick is the song &quot;Green Grow the Rushes&quot;:
 
             &quot; One of them is all alone and 
             ever more shall be so.
             Two of them are lily-white boys 
             all clothed all in green Oh!
             Three of them are strangers o'er the 
             wide world they are rangers.
             Four it is the Dilly Hour when 
             blooms the Gilly Flower.
             Five it is the Dilly Bird that's 
             seldom seen but heard.
             Six is the Ferryman in the boat that 
             o'er the river floats, Oh!
             Seven are the Seven Stars in the Sky, 
             the Shining Stars be Seven, Oh!
             Eight it is the Morning's break when 
             all the World's awake, Oh!
             Nine it is the pale Moonshine, 
             the shining Moon is nine, Oh!
             Ten Forgives all kinds of Sin, 
             from Ten begin again, Oh! &quot;
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) This song can be interpreted to mean:
 
             1. There is One Power.
 
             2. The God has two aspects (Light and Dark).
 
             3. The Celts are a wadering people with
                the sacred number of &quot;3&quot;.
 
             4. The 4th Ogham is the Alder sacred to Bran
                the Blessed and his sister Branwen &quot;the
                Gilly Flower&quot;.
 
             5. The Wizard Merlin as well as the sacred
                number of the Celtic Gods (not to mention
                the number of points on a Pentagram).
 
             6. Keridwen's Coracle that ferries us to
                the Underworld.
 
             7. The sacred number of sea gods and the stars
                in the crown of Arianrhod.
 
             8. The number of judgement or resurrection.
 
             9. The Triple Moon Goddess Thrice emphasized
                The number of Priestesses that guard the 
                Cauldron of Rebirth.
 
             10.The necessity to find our &quot;True Selves&quot;
                in order to understand the Inner Mysteries. 
                The endless cycle of death and rebirth.
 
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Everone still awake?&lt;G&gt;
3172

(2-20,O'Ba'n) ?
(2-2,Rilla)   &lt;I am!&gt;
(2-8,O'Dubh)  O'Ba'n ga!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) this is your interpretation? 
(2-20,O'Ba'n) GA
(2-8,O'Dubh)  It is also Murry Hope's interpretation.  I have seen a
different version of this song.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) &lt;patting self on back&gt; suits me! GA
(2-8,O'Dubh)  that is used by OATh coven and had hoped that perhaps they
would be here tonight.
(2-24,da Medic) !

(2-8,O'Dubh) da Medic ga
(2-24,da Medic) Cunningham also had summat similar ga.
(2-8,O'Dubh) Which book?
             ga
(2-24,da Medic) Not sure, will check &amp; advise, methinks in Earth Air
Fire water ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) Ok I have that one here will check in a min.  let's finish
up a bit first!
(2-8,O'Dubh) Perhaps some of you have some ancient or even modern Celtic
folk songs that you would like to share with us this evening? You could
enter them here and we could discuss them in detail or maybe just take
them to our hearts and embrace their inner messages (for Celtic Music is
a music of the Heart and Soul). I know that many of you are very into
Celtic Music. I'd like to have each of us contribute the names and
titles of our favorite performers and songss.
 
(2-8,O'Dubh) My favorite song is the &quot;Rising Of the Moon&quot; by the Clancy
Brothers and Tommy Liam.
 
(2-24,da Medic) !
(2-8,O'Dubh) da Medic ga
(2-24,da Medic) Joe doughterty's lament, black 47
(2-24,da Medic) ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) ok ! Others?
(2-20,O'Ba'n) &lt;embarrased&gt; all mine deal with young maidens getting
taken advantage of or with drinking, mostly poiti'n (e.g.Cruiscean lan)
(2-11,Nan)   !
(2-8,O'Dubh) hahaha LOL O'Ba'n !!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) !
(2-8,O'Dubh) O'Ba'n ga
(2-26,Adam)  ?
(2-11,Nan)   there are sooooo many i can't chose a favorite, but one of
the more interesting is &quot;the Tain&quot; by Horselips ga
(2-8,O'Dubh) neat nan!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) Do you know Ben phagin? I have it but no translation, also
the well below the valley o!
(2-8,O'Dubh) Most Celtic songs I've heard always have a hidden meaning
(2-20,O'Ba'n) GA
(2-8,O'Dubh) un minuto OB!
(2-8,O'Dubh) Adam question? ga
(2-26,Adam)  OD, I lost some of your send  :P  Which is your favorite
song?
(2-8,O'Dubh) Adam&gt; My favorite song is the Rising of the Moon.  by the
Clancy Brothers and Tommy Liam.

3173

(2-26,Adam)  thanks  :)
(2-8,O'Dubh) OB&gt;Have that one as well.
(2-8,O'Dubh) OB ga
(2-24,da Medic)  gotta go do the work thing-Blesed Be! ga
(2-20,O'Ba'n) that one is all about english occupation and resistance as
related to a duck &lt;G&gt;
(2-11,Nan)    lol
(2-8,O'Dubh)  OB&gt;I know it well (it's about a goose I thought)
(2-20,O'Ba'n) how 'bout 5 (or 7) nights drunk!
(2-11,Nan)    ?
(2-8,O'Dubh)  But it's really about a man that was killed by the
English.  They had to sing it in riddles to avoid being hanged.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) O'D&gt; and how we has plenty of relatives to take up the
fight!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  That's right. I am reading Trinity right now.  about the
fight for home rule.
(2-8,O'Dubh)  more favorites out there?
(2-4,Da Shad) OD, went to an Irish festival this weekend...
(2-2,Rilla)  &lt;great book!&gt;
(2-4,Da Shad) and was really shocked at how strong a presense that the
IRA had there, several booths for signing petitions and sending money to
the IRA.  Pledges even!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) &quot;bad luck to the savage to grease his white cabbage that
wantonly murdered me beautiful drake&quot; BTW Drakes are male ducks...
(2-20,O'Ba'n) Ganders are male geese &lt;G&gt;
(2-11,Nan) &lt;---going to the Chieftans next w'end &lt;VBG&gt;
(2-20,O'Ba'n) &lt;green&gt;
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Da Shad&gt;They need to do something settle the issues up
there.
(2-8,O'Dubh)  OB&gt;Yer right yer scoundrel.
              :P~
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Nan&gt;great!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Any ideas about next week's Workshop?
(2-4,Da Shad) If the IRA really wanted to get the brits out...
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Hint hint hint!
(2-4,Da Shad) they just need to blow up the shipyards in Northern
Ireland.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) I spoke to an Irishman who was probably in the IRA 
              since he denied it...
(2-4,Da Shad) Once there is no more economic value in northern ireland-
...
(2-11,Nan)    how about a workshop on stone circles etc.
(2-4,Da Shad) there owuld be no more need for the brits to keep troops
there.
(2-20,O'Ba'n) his theory was for the Brits to just pull out, I said
&quot;bloodbath would follow&quot;, he said...
(2-8,O'Dubh)  Nan&gt; Great idea!!
(2-4,StonedAgain) Just call me stonie!  (g)
(2-20,O'Ba'n) yes for 3-5 yrs then it would settle down and achieve
normalcy with the rest of Ireland
(2-11,Nan)    is this wkshp officially over? (loggin on long distance
here)
(2-20,O'Ba'n) one would guess &lt;G&gt;
(2-8,O'Dubh)  yes Nan we're done for the night.
(2-2,Rilla)   Nice job, Odie!
(2-4,Shadow Hawk) Gee, didn't realize that there was a workshop going
on, sorry.

(2-2,Rilla)   OB&gt; are you a Bard?

(2-20,O'Ba'n) R&gt; wannabe

(2-8,O'Dubh)  Mostly the fathers side though!
(2-20,O'Ba'n) LOL!
(2-8,O'Dubh)  However they did marry the Picts
              and made them agree to trace lineage on the Mother's
side!&lt;G&gt;
(2-20,O'Ba'n) I heard somewhere they were matrilineal, since they were 
              quite open sexualy
(2-20,O'Ba'n) &lt;G&gt;
(2-8,O'Dubh)  The women had a lot of different partners.
              and the men went both ways
              if you can believe a lyin Roman that is!&lt;G&gt;

record and ck the pub, that's them

3181

Before I begin let me say a few words about how the Workshop is
conducted.  We will first hear from a presenter, tonight that is me. If
you have a question type in a ? and I will acknowledge you by typing
&quot;ga&quot; at and appropriate time.  When you have finished your question type
&quot;ga&quot; to let me know that I may respond. When we are finished I will
acknowledge the next questioner in a similar manner. If you have a
comment or additional information to provide on a topic, please use the
&quot;!&quot; to signal me.  I will also cycle through those with comments. If
their are no questions at this point I will begin tonight's  presen-
tation.
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) I would also like to apologize for not producing
the list of tree correspondences this week that I promised to provide.
Being on the road and away from home, I was not able to get to all my
references about trees, herbs and the like. I haven't forgotten the
promise however. I will post the list as soon as I return to Virginia
this weekend. This list can be used together with certain meditation
practices to determine the &quot;soul tones&quot; of the Tree Oghams. I did locate
the Ogham/musical tone table of correspondences that I had mentioned in
the Celtic Workshop #4. This table is by the Celtic scholar Dr. Sean

                For more information on this subject, I recommend

Dalton Ltd., Dublin).
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The beliefs of the Celts and their Magickal/Religious
practices cannot be fully understood without becoming more familiar with
their Cosmologies and Deities. In considering how to proceed with the
Workshop, a variety of topics came to mind:
 
                        The Otherworld
                        The Gods and Goddesses

                        The Guardians of the Circle
                        The &quot;Place Names&quot; 
                        The &quot;Totem Animals&quot;

                        The Charm of &quot;Making&quot;
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Subject of tonight's Celtic Workshop is The Celtic
Otherworld.
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The topics I plan to cover tonight are:
        
                        The Otherworld
                        The Gods and Goddesses
                        The Objects of Power
                        The Guardians of the Circle
 
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain )         &quot;The Celtic Cosmology&quot;
 
The number three was sacred to the Celts and the Druids.  It should come
as no surprise that the Celtic Cosmos is threefold: The Sky World, The
Earth World and the Underworld. Each of these realms is associated with
particular deities and Magickal acts or techniques.  
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Sky World was associated with the heavenly bodies:
the Sun, the Moon, the stars. This is the realm of the Gods and
Goddesses and is associated with the cycles and patterns of the Sky (and
perhaps also associated with The Megalithic Stone Circles).  These
visible objects were used as a basis for performing Higher Magicks such
as: Prophecy and Astral travel. The cycles of the Sun and Moon also were
used to determine the appropriate times for doing particular types of
Magick. Festivals were held during Full Moons, Dark Moons, the 6th nite
of the New Moon, Sunrise, Sunset and the 4 days of the Solar extremes;
Mid Winter, Mid Summer and the Equinoxes. The heavenly bodies were not
themselves considered to be Deities, but were thought to reflect or
contain the types of Power associated with particular entities. The
Fires of the Sun were associated with the forge and with inspiration,
possibly making Brigid (An aspect of the Irish Celtic Triple Goddess)
also a Sun Goddess. Bel or Belenus was usually associated with the
powers of the Sun as well. 
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Underworld is the realm of the Ancestors, as well
as former humans and a number of Gods and Goddesses associated with the
mystery of life springing forth from death. This process could be as
simple and mysterious as the life cycle of a seed. From old life, new
life appears in a series of changes from planting and germination to
growth and harvesting. The passage graves and burial customs of the
Celts also reflect this expectation of rebirth and afterlife. Many tombs
and burial sites show that Celts were buried with objects that they
could take with them into the Underworld to be used in battle, in
hunting and/or for nourishment. This practice appears to be similar to
what was practiced by many ancient peoples, including the Egyptians.
Celts did not fear death, they expected to live on and eventually be
reborn in another life. The Underworld and the Sky world were linked in
3184

this Mystery, sharing many of the same Gods and Goddesses. The daily
rebirth of the Sun and the phases of the Moon are a good instance of
this link between the World above and the one below.
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Earth World, occupied by we the living, also
contains reflections and influences of the Sky World and the Underworld.
These influences can be pictured as three zones (remember three is a
sacred number): the upper zone is associated with the weather, the
flight of birds, sky augeries and the elements and powers of Air, the
middle zone is further divided into the Four Directions or Quarters
(each with it's own Powers/Guardians of the Sacred Land), and the lower
zone containing the depths of the sea, caves, cairns, burial mounds,
&quot;hollow hills&quot; and sacred springs. This zone is the home of the Sidhe
and the spirits associated with the Portals to the Underworld itself.
The Celts in their life upon the Sacred Land expected to experience the
influences of the Sky and Underworld in their life upon the Land. This
attitude is demonstrated in the many dindsenchahs (stories of place
names) that are told in Ireland to this day. Many of these stories are
associated with a deity, an elemental, an Underworld portal or a combat
of the God/desses and/or Epic heroes and heroines.

(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The following is a listing of the major Irish Gods and 
                Goddesses:

                        Pwyll, Pryderi, Kicva
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) These two groups seem to relate to one another but
sometimes the correspondences can get very confusing. I include the
deities that most closely resonate with my own Inner Being when working
with the Sky World and the Underworld. My pantheon of Gods and Goddesses
is both Welsh and Irish (as am I &lt;G&gt;). I include a more detailed
description of them here:
 
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Danu
                        The Red Mother of All,
                        Major Mother Goddess of Ireland,
                        Mother of the Gods and Patroness of
                        wizards, rivers, water, wells, prosperity
                        and plenty, Magick and wisdom.
3185
 
                Dagdha
                        The All Father,
                        Eochaid Ollathair ( Father of All),
                        Ruadh Rofessa (The Red One, Lord of
                        Occult Knowledge),
                        Dagdha (the Good God)
                        Many talented and powerful,
                        Master of the harp and possessor
                        of a dread double ended club.
                        The Chief of the Tuatha de Dannan.
 
                The Goddess of Sovereignty (Banbha, Fodla, Eriu)
                        The Land and the King were wed through
                        many ceremonies. Essentually the fate of the
                        King and the fate of the land were One and
                        vice versa. The Favor of the Goddess could
                        be granted by some heroic act or bu being
                        Magickally chosen (The Lia Fail could do
                        this, more later). Women who held the 
                        Sovereignty of the land were often referred
                        to as the Goddess (Such as Medb, Boudicca
                        and Macha-Red Mane).
                Nuada
                        The King and battle leader 
                        of the Tuatha de Dannan,
                        Possessor of the Magick Sword of Findias,
                        Lost his sword hand in the First Battle of
                        Moytura, against the Fir Bolgs,
                        stepped down from the Kingship
                        (because the King could nave no blemish)
                        even though he was outfitted with a 
                        Magickal hand of silver. He eventually
                        had his hand Magickally restored to lead
                        the Tuatha de Dannans  against the Fomors
                        in the second Battle of Moy Tura. In this
                        battle he was physically killed so he 
                        returned the Lands of the Sidhe.
                Brigid
                        Breo saighead (Fiery Arrow or Power)
                        Often called the Triple Brigid or the
                        Triple Mother. Also Associated with
                        Danu at times. The daughter of the Dagdha.
                        Goddess of the Sacred Flame of Kildare.
                        Goddess of poets, feminine crafts, the
                        hearth, martial arts, healing and
                        inspiration. The White Maiden aspect of 
                        the Triple Goddess. Her Feast is the
                        Major Celtic Festival of Imbolc. She 
                        who gives hope and new beginnings. The
                        Celtic Church could not replace her, so
                        they absorbed her as the &quot;foster-mother&quot;
                        of Christ and as St. Brigit, the daughter
                        of the Druid Dougal the Brown. Brigid is
                        very like the Greek Goddess Athena.
                Lugh
                        Sam ildanach (many skilled). This is the
                        Celtic Mercury. The grandson of Balor 
                        (leader of the Fomorians and the son of
3186

                        Cian and Ethniu, a Sidhe princess. His 
                        feast is Lughnasadh, a celebration of
                        the death of his &quot;foster mother&quot;, Tailtiu.
                        He is the combination of the Tuatha de
                        Dannans and the Fomors. He replaces Nuada
                        as the King and battle leader of the Tuatha
                        de Dannan and leads them to ultimate victory
                        in the second Battle of Moytura. He is 
                        sometimes called the &quot;Shining One&quot; and/or
                        Lugh Lamhfada (of the &quot;long arm&quot;). 
                        He also has attributes of a carpenter, mason,
                        poet,Druid, physician and a goldsmith. He
                        can be considered the Irish God of just about
                        everything. He was also the father of the
                        great Irish hero, Cuchulain.

                        antics, he was an extremely powerful God 
                        and was usually associated with fertility,
                        rebirth, weather, sailing and Magick. He also
                        had a Magickal ship that moved without sails

3187

                        Gwion had tasted of her cauldron, she chased him

                        at last she caught and consummed him as a grain
                        of wheat. This caused her to give birth to

                Scathach

                       Goddess of martial arts. The Destroyer aspect   
                      of the Dark Goddess. A great sword warrior and

2-6,O'Dubhain )         &quot;The Objects of Power&quot;
 
The Tuatha de Dannans are the Children of the Mother Goddess Danu. They
are the Gods and Goddesses of Ireland. Some say they come from the sky,
others say the North. They were masters of Occult knowledge learned in
the four great Magickal cities of Findias, Gorias, Murias and Falias.
They were given a great treasure by the Chief Mages of each city
(Uiscias from Findias, Esras from Gorias, Semias from Murias and
Morfessa from Falias). These gifts are the four treasures of Ireland:
The Sword of Nuada, the Spear of Lugh, the Cauldron of Rebirth and the
Stone of Fal. We can use the Power of such gifts in our own Magick by
invoking the four Masters of the North.  Once invoked, the Power of 
3188

their gifts can once again be manifested in our very own Magickal
Talismans.
 
 
2-6,O'Dubhain )         &quot;The Sword Of Nuada Argetla'm&quot;
 
The first object of Power comes from Findias. It is the invincible sword
of Nuada &quot;of the silver hand&quot;.  It represents the forces of insight and
illumination.  It is a representation of the terrible Powers of creative
energy. The drawing of such a sword is what gives us new and terrible
abilities (Atomic Power is an example of what such inspiration can
create). The wisdom to not use or to maintain control such powers is
what the use of this Sword is all about. Many times the wisest course of
action is to keep the Sword sheathed and to resolve our conflicts
peacefully.

Here is a description of this Magickal weapon's use in a modern day
ritual:
               &lt;I walk to the altar and pick up the Sword.  Advancing to the
East, I raise the Sword and say:&gt;  &quot;Here is the Sword of Nuada Argetla'm
in its deady scabbard.
                        Heed the Magicks of Findias! 
                        Uiscias wrought this blade! 
                        He of the Silver Hand lives again!
                        Who will dare to grasp it and define 
                        the boundaries of our safety?&quot;
        
               &lt;After the sword has been accepted by a member of the Circle,
               the following is said while walking three times (deosil)
               around the perimeter of the Circle :&gt;
 
                        &quot;Come forth Old One of the East!!!&quot;
        
          &lt;After the completion of the three circles, I light the Red
Candle of Life that sits upon the Eastern Quarter and say:&gt;
 
                        &quot;Guard us well so that our lives may be our own.
                        Dia is Bandia linn!
                        (So Mote It Be!)&quot;
 
2-6,O'Dubhain )         &quot;The Spear of Lugh Lamhfadha&quot;
 
The second object of Power comes from Findias. It is the iresistible
Spear of Lugh &quot;of the Long Arm&quot;.  This gift represents the ability to
act across a distance.  It is represented by the Powers of fire that can
also act across a distance, leaping between burning buildings yet also
warming us from within the hearth fires. This flaming spear always finds
its target once thrown. It is no surprise that Lugh must defeat Balor
&quot;of the Evil Eye&quot; allowing the Tuatha de Dannans to conquer the Fomor.
Today the ability to act across a distance might be better characterised
by the telephone/communications networks.  The free exchange of
information has fanned the flames of creativity in the modern world.
 
2-6,O'Dubhain ) Here is a description of this Magickal weapon's use in
the same modern day ritual as before:
                 
                        &lt;I walk to the altar and pick up the Spear.
Advancing to the South, I raise the Spear and say:&gt;
3189
 
               &quot;In my Right hand I hold the Spear of Lugh Lamhfadha.
          Brought from Gorias and given by Esras.
          It contains the Wisdom of Many acting across the Ways.
          No batle can be sustained against us while we possess it.
          Who will wield this Power?&quot;
 
2-6,O'Dubhain ) &lt;After the spear has been accepted by a member of the
Circle, the following is said while walking three times (deosil) around
the perimeter of the Circle :&gt;
 
                        &quot;Come forth Old One of the South!!!&quot;
        
&lt;After the completion of the three circles, I light the White Candle of
Inspiration that is in the South and say:&gt;
 
                        &quot;Guard us well so that our ideas may burn
                        as does Thy eternal flame.
                        Dia is Bandia linn!
                        (So Mote It Be!)&quot;
 
2-6,O'Dubhain )         &quot;The Cauldron of Rebirth&quot;
 
The third object of Power comes from Murias. It is the &quot;Cauldron of
Rebirth&quot;. This gift has the  Power to regenerate life and is usually
associated with the Dagdha or Bran the Blessed. It can also be linked
with portals to the Otherworld through which all life  passes during the
death/life cycle. Mannanan mac Llyr who rules the sea and who is the
possessor of the &quot;Crane Bag&quot; (another symbol for the Cauldron) is
another deity associated with this Magickal device. The Welsh Goddess
Cerridwen is also a keeper of the Sacred Cauldron.The Spring of Life and
wisdom flows forth from the depths of the sea (another use for this
cauldron).
  
2-6,O'Dubhain ) Here is a description of this Magickal device's use in
our modern day rituals:
 
                        &lt;I walk to the altar and pick up the Cauldron. 
I place it upon the West Quarter and say:&gt;
 
                        &quot;This is the Cauldron of Rebirth, 
                        by it's waters we are reborn.
                        Fashioned in the fires of Murias,
                        Forged by the will of Samias.
                        Life eternal is its gift.
                        We pass through Death with each use.
                        May the waters of rebirth ever flow forth!
                        Who will call us back 
                        from the deepest meditation?
                        Who will summon us from the Shadows
                        of the Sea?&quot;
 
                        &lt;The Cauldron has sea salted water poured into
it by a member of the Circle, This water is sprinkled three times
(deosil) around the perimeter of the Circle while the following is
said:&gt;
 
                        &quot;Make thy Presence known Old One of the West!&quot;
        
3190

&lt;After the completion of the three circles, I light the Gray Candle of
Twilight that stands in the West and say:&gt;
 
                        &quot;Keep our Spirits safe within Your soft embrace.
                        Dia is Bandia linn!
                        So Mote It Be!&quot;
 
2-6,O'Dubhain )         &quot;The Lia Fail&quot;
This is the Kingship stone of Ireland. It was brought from the Northern
city of Fal by the Tuatha de Dannan. This stone represents the Land and
it's Sovereignty. It also represents the Power of the Earth to Judge all
men. The other portals to the Underworld (caves and raths) are represen-
ted by this Magickal object.  The dark reaches of the Underworld hide
the secret knowledge of Death and Life. It is into the earth that Celts
are buried to begin their journeys after death. Small wonder it is that
the Goddess guarding this object should be the dread Morrighan. She
represents the Wisdom that is gained via the Dark Pathways, yet she is
also the bringer of victory in battle as well as new life, where none
was expected. She represents the stark reality of Life and Death.
 
2-6,O'Dubhain ) Here is a description of this Magickal device's use in
our modern day rituals:
 
&lt;I walk to the altar and pick up the Stone.  I place it in front of the
North Quarter candle and say:&gt;
 
     &quot;This is the Lia Fail, let all here be sobered by its True  Judgement. This is the Stone of Judgement, Solemn sacred One of Falias,
grant our space your Sovereignty.  Morfesa has worked the   Earth's
Power within you.  Judge of Kings, Center of Earth, Speak   and we shall
listen!  Do not let us fail to heed your warnings!&quot;
        
&lt;I turn to face the members of the Circle and ask:&gt;
        
                        &quot;Who will Stand with the Stone of Destiny?&quot;
 
&lt;The One that has accepted the challenge, steps upon the stone and crys
forth:&gt;
        
                        &quot;Manifest your Power Old One of the North!&quot;
                        &quot;Open Your Dark Pathways
                        Give us True Judgement!
                        Bring forth Thy Hidden Knowledge!&quot;
 
&lt;I step back to the altar and face to the North.  I light the Black
Candle of Darkness and say to all those who are gathered:&gt;
 
                        &quot;May our souls know the Truth of Eternity.
                        Dia is Bandia linn!
                        So Mote it Be!&quot;
        
&lt;Starting at the East with arms open, I turn deosil around the Circle,
stopping when I have come back to the East and say:&gt;
 
     &quot;My Brothers and Sisters in the One Power, Hear my Words!  Our
Circle is complete!  We have Perfectly Created a Sacred Space, a Place
out of Time. Let none seek to enter who would violate our Purpose. Our
will shall be done and none shall be harmed! May the Guardians of the
3191

Four Quarters keep Their Watch over this Circle and lend us Their Mighty
Aid!&quot;
 
 
2-6,O'Dubhain )  That pretty much sums up the prepared presentation, any
questions?


(2-5,Nan)        Whew!
(2-5,Nan)        I'm still absorbing
(2-2,Freepowder) bet your fingers are cramped &lt;G&gt;
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) yep!  Well there is a lot more I could say!&lt;G&gt;
(2-2,Freepowder) ok!
(2-2,Freepowder) &lt;hehehehe&gt;
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Like We could talk about just where those cities were?
                 The Sky or the North?
                 UFO's maybe?
(2-2,Freepowder) ok, first tho, was the stone of fal...
(2-2,Freepowder) the same as the stone of scone?
(2-2,Freepowder) ga
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) That was what the Scots and the Sassanach would have us
believe.
(2-2,Freepowder) you say?
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) But the Irish tradition is that it is still inside of
Tara.
(2-2,Freepowder) thought so. hrumph.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Why would we every give away one of the treasures of
the Land?
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Besides!&lt;G&gt;
(2-2,Freepowder) stolen?
(2-5,Nan)        what's the stone of scone? (other than a very old tea
snack &lt;g&gt;)
(2-2,Freepowder) LOL
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) If it really was stolen then it sits in Westminister
Abbey!  And hasn't cried out in over 400 years!&lt;G&gt;
(2-2,Freepowder) nahm, it's still in Tara, yup!
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Meaning.....that the Sassanach are not the rightful
kings of Ireland!!!!&lt;GGGG&gt;
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The stone of Scone was the kingship stone of the Scots
(2-5,Nan)        ahh, now i remember
(2-2,Freepowder) N&gt; Scotland had a similar legend to that of the stone 
                 of Fal, it was taken to westminister abbey when the 
                 english took scotland
(2-2,Freepowder) And they niver give it back!
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Fp&gt;That's right....thieving Sassanch!&lt;G&gt;
(2-2,Freepowder) rude!
(2-5,Nan) lol
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) &lt;======Just finished &quot;Trinity&quot; and in a very 
                 unforgiving mood.
(2-2,Freepowder) the 4 cities, which world were they in?
(2-2,Freepowder) LOL!
(2-2,Freepowder) grand book! read it a few years ago.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Yes it sure makes one think that they'll never resolve 
                the Problem of Northern Ireland.
(2-2,Freepowder) I met a fellow, prob IRA, said...
(2-2,Freepowder) the brits need to just pull out...
(2-2,Freepowder) I said ther'd be a blood bath....
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Fp&gt;The Four Cities were in the North but in the       
3192

          Spirtual Plane.
(2-2,Freepowder) he said for a few years then it would come right.
(2-2,Freepowder) sky or earth or underworld?
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Fp&gt;Sky types always associated with the Spirit and Big 
                 Magick. But of course two of the gifts were associated 
                 with the Underworld. The Stone and the Cauldron.
(2-2,Freepowder) sounds like a commercial, 'Big,Big Magick!' &lt;G&gt;
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Goes back to that dual nature of the Deities again. 
John Matthews has a great picture in his book, &quot;Celtic Shamanism&quot; of a
World Tree that has roots in the Underworld and branches into the Sky
World.  The two are connected by a Rainbow of colors , stars and 
Totem animals!
(2-2,Freepowder) you have more books than I have money &lt;G&gt; 
                 &gt;sounds like Yggdrisll
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The Rainbow &quot;brige&quot; exists outside of the Physical
World entirely.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Yes it does sound like Yggdrisll!  I have a GIF of this
Cosmology at home and will upload it to Library 16 this weekend.
(2-2,Freepowder) now, where have I heard of the rainbow bridge....Jesse 
                 Jackson? &lt;G&gt;
(2-5,Nan)        well, i should be on my way.....thanks for another
great workshop O'D. Looking forward to more :)
(2-2,Freepowder) cool!
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Yes folks Jesse JAckson is the new Celtic Rainbow
God!&lt;G&gt;
(2-2,Freepowder) Rofl!
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Thanks for coming Nan!&lt;G&gt;
(2-5,Nan)        see ya next week.....bye (poof)
(2-2,Freepowder) bye nan!
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Hey Fp&gt;What do you think we should cover next time?
(2-2,Freepowder) I was heart broken, couldn't come up w/ ?s from last wk
&lt;G&gt;
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Think folks are just hanging back and uploading the 
                 transcripts?
(2-2,Freepowder) the rest of the stuff at the top of this.&lt;G&gt;
(2-2,Freepowder) yeah, it might help if the right rom was listed in
notices
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Oscar night is a tough night to compete with the
Tube!:(  I did mention that to the Sysops, but I guess they have their
hands full.
(2-2,Freepowder) as long as they are reading..'sok
(2-2,Freepowder) hey! I volunteered to get into sysopery &lt;G&gt;
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) &lt;======would like to get some additional opinions 
                 on some of this stuff.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) FP&gt;You did? Great!
                 What was the response?
                 This workshop is closed! BTW!&lt;G&gt;
(2-2,Freepowder) well, maybe if you are in the right place at the right
time bla bla...
(2-2,Freepowder) I figured that out
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) LOL!
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) &lt;======just wanted it in the transcript!&lt;G&gt;

&lt;We next engaged in some generalized Celtic discussion that I thought
would be of interest to the offline class readers!&lt;G&gt; ...&gt;

&lt;Our discussion was joined by DRUID at this point&gt;

(2-13,DRUID)     I am also a member of the F.O.I. located in south
eastern Ireland.
(2-2,Freepowder) FOI? sorry &lt;G&gt;
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) FP&gt;yeah !!! Chunk another hot spear into that Fomorian 
                 peeper!&lt;G&gt;
(2-13,DRUID)     Fellowship of Isis. Olivia Robertson
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Dia dhuit, a DhRUID!
(2-2,Freepowder) there is one referenct to lugh using a rock I think &lt;G&gt;
(2-13,DRUID)     as far as books, i have quite a few, would
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) The FOI sounds Thelemic to me.
(2-13,DRUID)     not know what to recomend.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) I read the Book of Druidry by Ross Nichols
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Found it to be based upon the works of Davies and
Morganwig.
(2-13,DRUID)     I saw that you were giving a workshop on Ogham.
(2-13,DRUID)     I have seen some of the origional standing Ogham stones 
                in northern England.
(2-13,DRUID)     They are standing in remote fields, not even marked
very well.
(2-2,Freepowder) Must be nice to live on the ground so to speak ,less
the economy, tho &lt;G&gt;
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) DRUID&gt;It's my belief that the Oghams carved upon sticks 
                have long since disintergrated.
(2-13,DRUID)     They are weather beaten, but you can still make them
out.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) BTW They did find some Standing stones in this country 
                 with Oghams upon them!&lt;G&gt;
(2-13,DRUID)     Yes i would agree, however these are stone, 
                 tall about 4 feet.
(2-2,Freepowder) OD&gt; really?! where?
(2-13,DRUID)     I do not think so.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) &lt;=====looking in reference right now
(2-13,DRUID)     On an island in northern England, the name of the
island escapes me,
(2-2,Freepowder) and don't say L.A.!
(2-2,Freepowder) the ones in the US, Druid
(2-13,DRUID)     but i could go look it up if you want. I also have
pictures of them.
(2-2,Freepowder) they have some in Ireland yet don't they?
(2-13,DRUID)     say it is highly possible.
(2-2,Freepowder) where did the 'key' to the oghams come from, culdeans?
(2-13,DRUID)     I have that information, i would need to refresh me
memory, but it was from the old Ogham alphabet, and religion.
(2-2,Freepowder) seems to me I read about some, in the south I think,
3194

no, ulster?
(2-13,DRUID)     from the old Ogham alphabet, and religion.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Druid&gt;the reference is &quot;America BC&quot; by Professor Barry
Fell
(2-13,DRUID)     Does it actualy say there are stones in this country.?
(2-2,Freepowder) well, yes but how did the info survive, i.e. what was
the 'rosetta stone' for oghams
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) FP&gt;The key came out of the Book of Ballymote
(2-2,Freepowder) OD, Culdeans? or other?
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) DRUID&gt;I was looking at a reference to a reference.
                 FP&gt;Culdeans.
(2-13,DRUID)     Would you care to have me go and hunt up the info
(2-13,DRUID)     on what island it was.?
(2-2,Freepowder) no not online Druid &lt;G&gt;
(2-2,Freepowder) and where are the ones in the US?
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) Actual refernce was Celtic Gods Celtic Goddesses 
                 by R. J. Stewart
(2-2,Freepowder) post a msg at your convience &lt;G&gt;
(2-13,DRUID)     Ok i will try to join next week with the info at hand.
(2-2,Freepowder) cool!
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) great !!! Go raibh maith agat!
(2-13,DRUID)     I spent a month in Ireland &amp; England last year doing
(2-13,DRUID)     a systematic search of the old Pagan &amp; Druid Holy
sites.
(2-2,Freepowder) WOW!
(2-2,Freepowder) &lt;turning green&gt;
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) DRUID&gt;Pick up any strange sensations or Power?
(2-13,DRUID)     Got to join in a Autumn EQ. in the Catacombs of
(2-13,DRUID)     Clonigal Castle with Oliva Robertson. It was
(2-13,DRUID)     real intense.
(2-13,DRUID)     That was where i joined the FOI.
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) DRUID&gt; Is the FOI based upon Crowley's work?
                 What is it based upon?
(2-13,DRUID)     Is it too late in the course to join and still
benifit.?
(2-6,O'Dubhain ) We are only scartching the surface
                 We still have a lot of &quot;Works&quot; to cover.
(2-13,DRUID)     No it is an open organization, all forms of religion 
                 are welcome.

          &quot;Celtic Workshop #6 - Dindsenchas, Totems and Transmigration&quot;

This is a transcript of the sixth Celtic Workshop - Dindsenchas,Totems
and Transmigration. The purpose of this Workshop was to investigate the
Celtic Inner Spirit by looking at beliefs about the Land, the Family,
the Spirit and the Soul. The stories about name origins as well as the
practice of having totemic beasts seemed to be a good place to start. I
also hoped that such investigations would give added meaning to
understanding Druidic concepts of Being.

Before I begin let me say a few words about how the Workshop is con-
ducted.  We will first hear from a presenter, tonight that is me. If you
have a question type in a ? and I will acknowledge you by typing &quot;ga&quot; at
and appropriate time.  When you have finished your question type &quot;ga&quot; to
let me know that I may respond. When    we are finished I will ack-
nowledge the next questioner in a similar manner. If you have a comment
or additional information to provide on a topic, please use the &quot;!&quot; to
signal me.  I will also cycle through those with comments in a similar
manner. If their are no questions at this point I will begin tonight's
presentation.
 
(2-21,O'Dubh)   The Subject of tonight's Celtic Workshop
               is:
                               Dindsenchas, Totemic Animals and 
                               Transmigration of the Soul.
                
During the previous Workshop, we studied the Celtic Otherworld and their
God/desses. We saw how Existence was divided into a Higher, Middle and
Underworld reality. The Spirit of the Celt would be tied to and migrate
between these various worlds. A celt was very connected to the land as
well as having a strong belief in his &quot;code of conduct'&quot; and the
immortality of his Being. Tonight's Workshop will attempt to clarify how
A Celt arrived at these strong inner concepts of connection to his
family, his Land and his Eternal or Spirit life. In order to understand
the Celtic Spirit, one must know the Dinseanchas, the Totemic Animals
and the Druidic concept of Transmigration of the Soul.
 
(2-21,O'Dubh)   The first topic to be covered will be the Dinseanchas.
 
................................................................................
3198

               Dinseanchas or &quot;Place Name Stories&quot;
 
The Dinseanchas or &quot;Place Name Stories&quot; are among the earliest tales of
Ireland. This tract gives the etymology of the names of several of the
more well known places of Erinn. The first such &quot;place name&quot; that we
will discuss is the origin of the Names &quot;Meath&quot; and &quot;Uisnech&quot;. These two
locations are tied into the history of the Kings of Ireland. Meath is
the &quot;fifth&quot; division of Ireland set aside for the Ard Reis to rule and 
Uisnech is the hill that represents the Spiritual center of Ireland. 

(2-21,O'Dubh)   This is the story of Uisnech:
 
&quot;After the Tuatha de Dannans had been conquered by the Sons of Milesius
(Mileseans), Midhe the son of Brath, son of Detha, was the first to
light a fire in all of Erinn. This fire burned upon his hilltop for
seven years and all the fires of the land were lighted using this fire.
Midhe and his clan were entitled to a sack of corn and a pig from every
house in Erinn each year in return for maintaining this fire. Naturally
the Druids were envious of this fact and they met together to conspire
against Midhe and his clan. Midhe discovered the plot and attacked the
Druid conclave, cutting out the tongues of the Druids so they could not
speak against him. He buried these tongues in the earth and sat upon the
spot while his mother exclaimed that it was &quot;proudly&quot; or &quot;Uaisnech&quot; you
sit up there this night! This then is the derivation of the name of the
hill, Uisnech and of the province of Meath &quot;Midhe&quot;. BTW Uisnech is
pronounced &quot;ISH nuk&quot;.
 
Uisnech is the site also of the &quot;Well of Life&quot; where twelve major
Magickal rivers flow forth from the Underworld. Could this be the Magick
of the Druids tongues?
(2-10,Adam)     ?
(2-21,O'Dubh)   Yes Adam? ga
(2-8,O'Ba'n)    !
(2-8,O'Ba'n)    I've never heard this story
(2-21,O'Dubh)   Ok O'Ba'n a question?
(2-8,O'Ba'n)    GA
(2-21,O'Dubh)   This story is from the ancient Irish Writings.           You can find it in &quot;A Celtic Reader&quot; by John Matthews  It's source is
from Eugene O'Curry
(2-8,O'Ba'n) GA
(2-21,O'Dubh)   ok
(2-21,O'Dubh)   Here is a story of the origins of the name &quot;Tara&quot;:
 
&quot;Another significant hill is Tara. This hill had it's name changed five
times. It was first called Druim Descuin or &quot;the Conspicuous Hill&quot;, next
it was Liath Druim after a Firbolg chieftain who was first to clear it
of woods. The third name for the hill was Druim Cain  &quot;the Beautiful
Hill&quot;, then Cathar Crofinn, and finally Teamair (Anglicized Tara) from
the name Te'a the wife of Eremon the son of Milesius.&quot;
 
This story gives us a mini history of Ireland, from the original names
of the hill through the names ascribed to various invading tribes until
we see the name that it retains to this day &quot;Tara&quot;. BTW this name is
pronounced &quot;CHOW irr&quot; in Gaeilge.
 
(2-21,O'Dubh)   Another Dindseanchas is the story of Lughaidh Delbaeth
&quot;the fire-producer&quot;, a Dalcasian Druid.  &quot;Lugaid had a considerable
amount of land, while the husband of his daughter, Trad, though a king,
3199

had little land and a large family. Trad asked Lugaid for an oracle to
find out how he could gain more land. Lugaid consulted his oracles and
announced that if Trad would ask any man on that day to surrender his
lands, that man would be bound to comply. Trad then asked Lugaid to
surrender his lands which he did. Lugaid took his six sons with him
across the Shannon river where he started a fire by means of his Druid 
Power. This fire had five streams issuing from it.  Each of the eldest
five sons followed these flames to the site of their new lands. Lugaid
remained behind with his youngest son, Nos, and eventually dies and was
buried next to a lake, near to Carn Fiacha (now called Loch Lugh-phorta
or the Lake of Lugaid).&quot;
 
(2-21,O'Dubh)   This story is important for a few reasons: 
 
                               1. It is an instance of the use of Druid Magick to
create fire.
 
                               2. It shows the the use of oracles to determine a course
of action.
 
                               3. It demonstrates the sanctity of one's word of honor.
 
                               4. It shows the derivation of several place names as
well as the family name of &quot;Devlin&quot; (from Dealbhna, derived from
Debaeth).
 
A story of this sort was used to establish place names, to derive family
traditions, to demonstrate morality, to show the worth of cunning and
integrity. It is also a good example of Druidic Powers. it was from a
large wealth and variety of such tales that our ancestors remembered
their past and learned their code of living.
 
(2-21,O'Dubh)   This serves a similar function to the new book by
William Bennett.....can't recall the title.  But I think it's on the
best seller list right now....anyone know the book?  Something like the
Book of......?
(2-21,O'Dubh)   O'Ba'n ?  ah well continuing onward!&lt;G&gt;
(2-8,O'Ba'n)    dunno &lt;G&gt;
(2-4,Nan)       the book of o'ban????!!!! &lt;vbg&gt;
(2-21,O'Dubh)   I'll find the name and insert it!  Nan!!!!LOL!
(2-8,O'Ba'n)    great writer ain't I?
(2-10,Adam)     &lt;g&gt;
(2-21,O'Dubh)   The next topic to be discussed will be the Totemic
Animals.
 
            &quot;Celtic Totem Animals&quot;
 
Celts and Druids held the belief that each person and family had a
special relationship with animals and animal Spirit Beings that were
sacred to ech clan.  This belief is what Patricia Kennealy is referring
to in her book &quot;Strange Days, My Life With Jim Morrison&quot;. MS. Kennealy
is a member of an ancient clan of Irish &quot;Wolf Shamans&quot; whose tradition
states that they are the Magickal leaders of their people.  This
association of Spirit Animals or &quot;Totems&quot; is based upon the ancient
Celtic belief that all life is related, the Land, the waters, the
spirits of a place, the trees, the flora and the animals that they lived
with side by side. Many ancient stories tell how the Druids could
&quot;shapeshift&quot; into animal form to escape or work Magick. To know your
3200

Inner Celtic Spirit, you must know your clan and your personal Spirit
Animal.
 
(2-25,Denise H) I am here at last :)
(2-21,O'Dubh)   The following animals appear throughout Celtic tales
and Magick:
 
               The Salmon (Brionnfhionn)
 
This is the fish of All Wisdom. It lives in the depths of the Sea from
which all life springs. It is said to acquire it's great knowledge from 
eating the Nine Hazels of Wisdom that fall from the Tree of Knowledge.
This fish was said to be among the oldest of living creatures. The great
Hero and Druid Fionn mac Cumhail gained his wisdom by touching his thumb
to a salmon that he was cooking for the Druid Fintan.
                
               The Deer or Stag (Abhach, Sailetheach)
 
The deer was said to be a fairy creature that could pass between the
world's. This was especially true for a white deer. Fionn's wife Sabha
became a deer when she went to the Otherworld. Beautiful women frequen-
tly became deer in many tales while fleeing from hunters. The Druid Tuan
mac Carill is the sole survivor of a group of early Partholanian Irish
settlers. He lives at first as a wildman of the woods eventually
becoming a stag, an eagle, a salmon and eventually is reincarnated as
himself at a much later date to give the ancient history of Ireland to
the more recent settlers.
 
               The Horse (Cab-all)
 
The horse  was one of the most important animals to  the Celts. A mare
is ritually symbolically mated by the King in the Rite of Sovereignty.
White horses are also mystical beings. It is a pale horse that is ridden
by Gwynn ap Nudd the Master of the Wild Hunt in Wales while gathering
souls. A huge horse shape is sculpted into the hills of Wiltshire called
White Horse Hill. This animal is another guide to the Otherworld.
 
               The Hawk (Seg or Aracos)

The most famous Hawk is the Hawk of Achill that can riddle and discuss
with the  Druidic poet Fintan. This animal is also as old as time and
another storehouse of great knowledge.
 
               The Blackbird (Druid-dhubh)
 
This is yet another animal that can freely pass into the Otherworld. It
is associated with the Druids and the Goddess Rhiannon. This bird has
mystical arts and can sing one into a trancelike state. It can give one
access to the Magick of the Otherworld  and is an excellent familiar.
This is not the Crow or Raven but a songbird.
 
               The Hound/the Dog (Abach)
 
This is an animal of the hunt and is frequently associated with
humanlike intelligence. The hounds of Fionn mac Cumhail, Bran and
Sgeolainn, are actually transformed humans, The Cwn Annwn, are the
Gabriel hounds that accompany Gwynn ap Nudd during the Wild Hunt as well
as guarding the gates to the Underworld or Annwn the kingdom of the God
3201

of the Dead, Arawn. Cuchulain the Champion of Ulster gets his name from
replacing the Hound of Cuchul that he kills. He is called the &quot;Hound
of Ulster&quot; from this event. The hound is also his totem animal.
 
(2-21,O'Dubh)   &lt;a slight pause&gt;

There are many other Magickal totemic animals in Celtic Magick and
history: the Eagle (Iolair), Crow (Badb), Raven (Bran), Sow (Airc), Boar
(Bacrie), Cat (Caoit), Otter (Balgair), Bear (Arth), Badger (Breach) and
the Eel (As-chu).
 
The Dragon is another mighty Magical animal that appears in British and
Welsh stories. It is, of course, a creature of fire but is also related
to the Power of the Land. Another word for Ley Lines is Dragon Lines.
Another name for raising Power is to invoke the &quot;Eye of the Dragon&quot;. The
whole Earth was viewed by the Druids as the body of the Dragon. Menhirs
and stone Circles were located at great Power nodes. The Celts called
Dragons &quot;Fire Drakes&quot;.
 
(2-21,O'Dubh)   The importance of these animals is in their use as
Spirit Guides in the Otherworld and their aid as a familiar in working
Magick. To find your totemic animal will require you to experience a
shamanistivc trance. This is usually accomplished by &quot;drumming&quot; and
meditation. (You'll need someone to drum or a &quot;drumming tape&quot; to allow
yourself a chance to really meditate). Open youself up to the God of the
Hunt as you meditate upon the Tree of Life. He will come to you while
you are in trance (usually after 10 to 40 minutes of drumming). Your
totem animal will apear running from the Great Forest. When the animal
appears, let its essence fill you. Become your totem. Dance its dance
and sing its song until you are one in the Spirit. You should repeat
this ritual as often as necessary to have a close rapport with your
Spirit Animal guide.  Much of what you are told and given will be from
the perspective of the Animal and will be difficult to understand unless
you are truly One with it.  

(2-4,Nan)       does one usually only have a single totem animal or is 
it possible to have more than one? ga
(2-21,O'Dubh)   It's possible to have more than one.  You might have a
clan totem as well as a personal totem animal.

(2-21,O'Dubh)   Ok I have one more topic to cover  &quot;The Transmigration
of the Soul&quot;
 
I would like to start this discussion by quoting an ancient Celtic
Culdean verse:
 
                              &quot;Out of a Timeless World
                              Shadows fall upon time.
                              From a beauty older than earth
                              A ladder the soul may climb.
                              I climb by Fionn's Stair
                              To a whiteness older than time.&quot;
                
The above verse is referring to Aradach Fionn, a listing of the Oghams.
Each rung of the ladder or stair represents a lesson learned or a new
life of continuing perfection. Such a series of lessons and rebirths are
a manifestation of the Druidic concept of the Tramsmigration of the
Soul.
3202                            
               A few quotes about Druids:
 
&quot;The principal point of their teaching is that the soul does not perish,
and that after death it passes from one body into another.&quot; .....Julius
Caesar.
 
&quot;Among them the doctrine of Pythagoras prevails, according to which the
souls of men are immortal, and after a fixed term recommence to live,
taking upon themselves a new body.&quot;....Diodorus
 
According to some sources, this transmigration of the soul was done in
an upward fashion, with each incarnation bringing the Being closer to
the True Spirit. According to others, we are reincarnated into future
lives of our progeny...thus Mongan is The Spirit of Fionn reincarnated
in the Seventh Century CE (Fionn himself was said to be Cumhail reincar-
nated). As we have seen previously, the Spirit of Tuan mac Carill is
reincarnated several times as a variety of animals until he is reborn
in the sixth century and relates his history of Ireland from the time of
Partholan forward, St. Finnen is the Irish monk to whom the story was
related. This story was eventually recorded in the Eleventh century
manuscript, &quot;The Book of the Dun Cow&quot;. No record exists to indicate that
the Druids believed in &quot;karma&quot;, duality (as seen in the concept of &quot;good
and evil&quot;), original sin (actually they believed man was inheritly
good), nor a heaven and hell afterlife.
 
Where did one's soul reside then ? Many stories were told and written of
the Otherworlds that awaited the Spirit between incarnations, These 
stories are called immrama or &quot;wonder voyages&quot; and usually involve
taking ship to a Magickal Isle. The voyages of Bran and St. Brendan 
generally fit into these catagories.
                
When one arrives at an Otherworldly island, time can pass extremely
slowly compared to the Physical world. Oisin the son of Fionn went to
such a faery world for a few days only. When he returned for a visit
upon one of those Magickal White Horses, he discovered that many
hundreds of years had passsed.  Although he had been cautioned not to
dismount during his visit, he did so and was immediately transformed
into an extremely elderly man. St. Patrick was brought to him and heard
his many stories of the exploits of Fionn and the Fianna as well as the 
lands of Tir na Og. Oisin was eventualy rescued by his Sidhe princess
and returned to the Land of Eternal Youth. Some of the other Lands are
called:
 
                              Tir fo Thuinn - Land under the Wave.
                              Tir na mBan   - Land of Women.
                              Tir na mBeo   - Land of Life.
 
These four Tirs or lands make up the Celtic Underworld where Souls
reside until reborn. There are also Plains above that are generally the
habitations of the Gods.

The Irish Celts felt that the Being had the following attributes or
divisions:

                              Delph         - The appearance or Outer form
                              Duile         - The Body Elements 
                                                                           (flesh, bone, blood, etc)
                              Ana'l         - The breath or anima
                              Menma         - The Mind and the Will
                              Cuimhne       - The Memory
                              Fein          - The Self
                              Pu'ca         - The shape-shifting Shadow
                              Enaid         - The Soul.
 
I would like to finish my remarks on Reincarnation and Transmigration
with another ancient verse. This verse is from the Fifth Century CE and
is the translation by Kuno Meyer:
 
                              &quot;I invoke the seven daughters of the sea
                              Who fashion the threads of the sons of 
                              long life.
                              May three deaths be taken from me!
                              May seven waves of good fortune be dealt to me!
                              May no evil spirits harm me on my circuit!
                              In flashing corslet without hindrance!
                              May my fame not perish!
                              May old age come to me, may death not come 
                              to me until I am old!&quot;
 
                              &quot;I invoke Senach of the seven periods of time,
                              Whom fairy women have reared on the breasts 
                              of plenty.
                              May my seven candles not be extinguished!
                              I am an indestructable stronghold.
                              I am an unshaken rock.
                              I am a precious stone.
                              I am the luck of the week.
                              May I live a hundred times a hundred years.
                              Each hundred of them apart!
                              I summon their boons to me.
                              May the grace of the Holy Spirit be upon me!&quot;
 
That's the Celtic view of life!  To live but to have variety and
passion, while reincarnating over and over!&lt;G&gt;

                          Celtic Workshop #7 

   &quot;In Between Times and Places&quot;, &quot;Need Fires&quot; or Days of Imbalance,
          Portals, Dolmens, Passage Graves and Stone Circles&quot;

Tonight the Magickal nature of &quot;In Between Times and Places&quot; will be
discussed and examples will be given for their use in Magickal &quot;wor-
kings&quot;. The Druidic concept of &quot;imbalance&quot; in Magickal workings will be
introduced and discussed. The nature and use of the stone megalithic
sites will also be presented and discussed.

Tonight we undertake a journey to the lands that are between the worlds.
This is the same place where anything can happen that Rod Serling
referred to as the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;. The ancient Celts sought out this
3204

Magickal place to aid their Magickal Power and to seek the Otherworld.
Before we can undertake this journey of the Spirit as well as the Mind,
a brief review and synopsis of our previous discussions on the Celtic
Otherworld and Magick are in order. 

                     &quot;In Between Times and Places&quot;

As we noted previously, the Celts believed that Reality actually
consisted of multiple worlds.  As a minimum, they believed there was a
World of the Stars or Gods, a Middle World (the Earth) and an Under-
world. All these worlds were connected in some way, with events and
Magicks from one affecting events occuring in a different world.
The Celts believed that these Worlds were closer at certain times. These
are the &quot;In Between Times&quot; that we are going to speak about tonight. It
should also be no surprise that the Celts and Druids practiced their
most important Magicks during such times of transition as the sunrise,
sunset,the moonrise, moonset and the transitions of the seasons
(Beltaine and Samhain) and the extremes of the Sun (Mid-Winter and
Mid-Summer) or the great &quot;Fire Festivals&quot;. Later during our discussions
of stone circles and passage graves we shall see one way that this
desire to do Magick at the optimal times was possibly implemented.

                 &quot;The Magickal Laws of Druidic Power&quot;

Celtic tales of Magick are filled with events that are linked to &quot;in
between states&quot;. This could be a mysterious fog, a time of dusk or next
to the edge of water. All of these conditions have one state in common,
they represent imbalance. Any student of the physical sciences can tell
you, that all forces can  be resolved into the sum total of the in-
dividual forces. One of the factors that must be overcome when moving
anything is inertia. During times of change, when imbalance occurs
naturally, is the time chosen by Druids for their Magicks. This is and
example of the Law of Magickal Association, the Law of Similarity and
the Law of Contagion as stated by Issac Bonewits in his book &quot;Real
Magick&quot;. Here is a listing of those three laws of Magick:

         Law of Association.

If two things have anything in common that thing can be used to control
both, and they have a mutual influence on each other, depending on the
size of the thing shared. The more they have in common, the more they
influence each other.

         Law of Similarity.

This is the basis of &quot;Sympathetic&quot; magic and basically says that effects
resembles causes.  &quot;Lookalikes are alike&quot;.

         Law of Contagion.

It states that once things come into contact, they continue to interact
after separation.  &quot;Power is contagious&quot;.

These three Laws of Magick basically say that if you want to do Magick
pick a time when Magick occurs that is similar to the kind of Magick
that you want to accomplish. There is a very similar belief held by
modern Wiccans.  Wiccans normally do creative or &quot;positive&quot; magick when
the Moon is in its waxing phases. Banishing or &quot;dark&quot; Magick is done
3205

during the waning phases of the Moon. Druidic Magick took advantage of
the times when the Sun or Moon &quot;touched&quot; the Earth (Sun/Moon rise/set).
At such a time, some of the Power inherit to these heavenly deities
could be &quot;borrowed&quot;. This is the Law of Contagion at work. At Sunrise
and Sunset is when the mists &quot;Magickally&quot; appear, making fog or mists a
time of Magickal workings. The area of transition between states of
matter such as the edge of a river or lake was also thought to be a
Magickal location. This could have been due to the belief that all
knowledge flowed forth from  the Well of Segais or Conla's Well but I
believe it is more closely associated with the belief that where
different worlds met was also a place where entry to the Otherworld was
the easiest.  This also explains why they favored divination by the edge
of water. Fire scrying is another example of this &quot;Magick&quot; in transition
states. Fire is the ultimate transitory state of matter and leads us to
the next  topic of discussion, &quot;Need Fires&quot; and &quot;Days of Imbalance&quot;.

                          &quot;Days of Imbalance&quot;

As you will recall, another time of greatest imbalance was when the
change of the seasons and the extremes of the Sun. This is, of course,
Beltaine, Samhain, Mid-Winter's and Mid-Summer's Solstices. Great fires
were kindled during these festivals for two reasons: To encourage and
enhance the energies of the Sun and to create conditions favorable to
Tramsmutation of Power.

These &quot;need fires&quot; were used to scry, to purify and to sacrifice as
well. Animals and other offerings were cast into the flames. As we have
seen in a previous Workshop, cattle were driven between the fires and
youths engaged in jumping through the flames. (It has been conjectured
that this practice of flame jumping had its origins in earlier practices
of human sacrifice.   I personally have not seen a single valid
reference to Druidic human sacrifices.)  The thought was also held that
&quot;like attracts like&quot;, so that the Power of the flames would also attract
the Magickal Power of the Sun.

Being periods of imbalance, the Druids also took advantage of the flows
of power to perform divinations.  These great fires also served to
signal the Power of the Druids to all people, as well as to unify their
control over the minds of the Celtic nations.

                 &quot;The Otherworld, Portals and Domans&quot;

Although the Celts did not build the megalithic structures found within
their lands, they were certainly aware of them. Without exception these
monuments were attributed to the God/dessess, heroes and/or to the
Tuatha de Dannan. The many dolmens were thought to be passage ways or
portals to the Otherworld.  Many myths and tales surround trips made to
and from the realm of the Sidhe by passing through a dolmen archway when
the Moon was full. Modern archeology has determined that these dolmens
are actually neolithic burial sites.

            &quot;Bru'gh na Bo'inne (Newgrange)&quot;

One of the oldest structures in the Western world is found in Ireland
upon the banks of the Boyne river. This is the Bru'gh na Bo'inne, the
burial place of Irish kings and the legendary palce of the Dagdha and
Angus mac Og. The area is also known, in English, as New Grange. This
structure was erected by the original inhabitants of the land around 
3206

3500 BC, predating Stonehenge and being contemporary with the Sphinx and
the Pyramids of Egypt. The structure was covered with white stones in
ancient times and would &quot;shine' in the Sun when seen from great
distances. This is very similar to the way the Great Pyramid was also
described when seen in the sunlight with it's reflective coating.

Many ancient Irish legends and tales are associated with this structure
and the passage of time. Most of these tales are about time standing
still or seeming to pass without notice. Their stories center around
Angus mac Og (the Young God), his birth in a day, his attaining the
ownership of the Bruig for &quot;only a day and a night&quot; (lasting forever in
endless cycles), and his arrangement of his foster father Midir's
marriage to Etain (who is the subject of many stories of shapeshifting
and transformation). 


                    &quot;Spirals, Symbols and Carvings&quot;

This theme of timeless days and transformation is very important when
one considers that one possible use of this structure was the taking of
shamanistic journeys. (Angus himself was visited by an aisling or &quot;dream
woman&quot; who played for him upon a timpan and eventually they are
transformed into white birds of enchantment).

Martin Brennan, an Irish-American, was the first person to note the
relationship between the carvings at New Grange and the rays of the Sun.
Using the discoveries of Brennan and our previous information about
Celtic Shamanism, I am going to suggest that the interior chambers of
this structure were used for shamanistic ceremonies and journeys.

Let me describe the geometry of Bru'gh na Bo'inne that a Draoi' priest
might have encountered when appraoching the structure for religious/Mag-
ickal ceremonies. The first thing that would be noticed is a brillant
white bowl or hemisphere shining amidst a sea of green. This mound is
surrounded by 97 kerbstones and the entire structure is then encircled
by a ring of standing stones.  At the entrance is a stone that one walks
around to enter the inner chambers. This stone is covered with spirals
that have been carved into the stone. The stone is divided by a line
that is aligned with the Mid-Winter Sunrise, the right hand spirals
being counter clockwise (tuathal or widdershins) and the left hand
spirals going clockwise (deosil). This is exactly the same type of path
through the sky that one would observe for the sun during the year. (In
fact, if you take a lens and focus the Sun's light on a board and leave
it in place for a year, a track will burned upon the board in the shape
of an interconnected double spiral. This experiment was done in the
early 1970's by American artist Charles Ross.)  The entrace to the
interior chambers, beyond the entrance stone, is 70 meters in length.
One must pass beneath three large stones that are thought to be symbolic
of the Celtic Cosmology, the Sky World, the Middle World and the
Underworld. Once past this Otherworldly entrance, one encounters a large
chamber with four smaller side chambers that are oriented to the four
cardinal directions (North, South, East and West). The inner walls are
covered with spirals and symbols, among them is an eight-rayed sun
symbol (depicted within a circle). This symbol as well as the rest are
selectively illuminated by the Sun's entrance through a small hole in
the roof box that is oriented directly to the Mid-Winter sunrise. A
finger of light would shine within the chamber to illuminate the
carvings, shining in golden flecks upon the chamber walls. Within the
3207

main chamber were great stone bowls that were possibly filed with water
and arranged to further enhance the solar display within by acting as
mirrors. The seemingly hap-hazard arrangement of carvings upon the walls
are organized and transformed by the rays of the Sun.

             &quot;A Night with Angus mac Og&quot;

Now that the stage is set, imagine yourself to be a seer of the fourth
millenia BC. You have fasted for days and have spent the long dark night
of Mid-Winter meditating within the inner chambers of Angus mac Og.  You
have performed your rituals you have attained a trance-like state and
you await the rising of the Sun, the new God of Light to return to the
world. What far journeys or estatic visions will be triggered within
your Sacred Space by the new Sun's first rays?  A sudden thin ray of
white light pierces the blackness of the inner chamber with an il-
luminating shower of images as the inner darkness explodes! Your mind
reflects the brilliance of the new born Sun as your inner consciousness
expands into infinity! Your brothers and sisters would follow the dark
shadow the standing stone to the carn's entrance to find you and the
inner chamber reborn within the rebirth of the Mid-Winter Sunrise! What
stories you could tell! What prophecies you could make! I sometimes
think that Bru'gh na Bo'inne is really the Hyperborean &quot; ...temple of
the Sun...&quot; mentioned by the ancient Greek writers, rather than
Stonehenge. 

                    &quot;The Land of the Hyperboreans&quot;

Perhaps the British Isles are the Islands of the Hperboreans after all?
Where else is found such a system of large scale, megalithic structures
all centered around the Sun and the Otherworld? One has only to step
within any of these raths to be transported to another time or another
age. Bru'gh na Bo'inne is only one among many such locations.  Three
great mounds exist in this area of the Boyne river, New Grange is the 
most elaborate but the nearby mounds of Dowth and Knowth are also
fascinating.  Dowth is oriented to receive the rays of the setting Sun
on Mid-Winter while Knowth has two passages and is oriented to receive
the rays of the Equinoxes.  These chambered passages are not limited to
Ireland, but are found throughout the British Isles and even in
Brittany. Two noteable sites are located at Maes Howe in the Orkney
Islands and at Gavrinis in Brittany. The interaction of carvings and
site orientation is also wide spread and not limited to just the rays of
the Sun. Many sites also used the beams of the Moon to illuminate
passages and special formations. Although these sites could be called
observatories by those of a purely scientific viewpoint, that would be
in direct contradiction to the aims and worldviews of their creators. To
fully appreciate the beauty, majesty and wonder of these Magick sites,
requires us to use our entire mind. Perhaps we should now consider the
other great location that has equal claim to being the Hyperborean
Temple of the Sun?  That location is called Stonehenge.

                             &quot;Faery Rings&quot;

Who has nor heard of the mysterious lights that are seen within faery
rings when the Sidhe dance within the Moon ways? Such lights have also
been observed within Magickal Circles constructed by Wiccans and modern
day Ceremonial Magicians. The crop circle phenomena has also been
associated with light displays and formations. All these phenomena have
been reported and seen by reliable witnesses (although , as with all
3208

such events, there have been cases of fraud as well). The fact is that
such circlular formations have all been associated with light displays
and other unexplained phenomena.  It is no coincidence that all of the
previously mentioned Magickal phenomena are also associated with the
oldest such locations, the stone circles. Many hundreds of these sites
are found in Britain, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The two greatest of
these are Stonehenge and Avebury. I will discuss Stonehenge tonight. I
may discuss Avebury in the future if it is of sufficient interest to the
other members of the workshop.

                             &quot;Stonehenge&quot;

Has there ever been a place to fire the imagination such as Stonehenge?
What secrets does it hide as it sits amid the many other marvels to be
found upon the Salisbury Plains ? This question and thousands more like
it have passed through the minds of mortals for at least the last 3000
years. Why was it built? Who built it? How was it used? Can it be used
again? I'm sure you many have a few questions of your own!&lt;G&gt;  Before we
get to the questions, let's go through a few of the details we know
about the site and some of the more recent discoveries that have been
made regarding its possible uses.

               &quot;Stonehenge I&quot;

Stonehenge was built in three phases, starting with the construction of
Stonehenge I around the year 1900 BC.  This is about a thousand years
after the Pyramids and the tombs of the Bru'ghna Bo'inne and a few
hundred years before the fall of ancient Troy and the Oddessy.  The
first phase of construction was a great circular ditch with banks being
piled upon either side.  The people building it were late Stone Age
people, Not much is known about them except that they were hunters. An
opening was left on the northeast side with four holes being left at the
entrance that may have contained wooden poles. Two other holes inside
the enclosure may have held upright stones. A third hole was dug that
still contains the &quot;heel stone&quot;, over which the sunrise is observed. A
variety of other features are associated with this first phase of
construction. I shall refer you to &quot;Stonehenge Decoded&quot; by Gerald S.
Hawkins and John B. White for a more indepth discussion of these or
other Stonehenge details. The entire structure was about 320 feet in
diameter and about 6 feet high by 20 feet wide with the heel stone and
possibly two other standing stones being visible. The entire bank would
have been glaring white since most of the surrounding surface region is
composted mostly of chalk. The heel stone rises about 16 feet into the
air and is about 8 feet thick by 7 feet wide. Around the inside of the
bank was a series of 56 holes called &quot;Aubrey&quot; holes. These holes contain
the created remains of men and women from that period. Even in its first
phase, I'm sure you'll agree, it must have been an imposing structure.

                   &quot;Stonehenge II&quot;

Work upon the second phase of Stonehenge was begun about 1750 BC by
another race of people known as the &quot;Beaker People&quot;. These people built
two concentric inner stone rings consisting of 82 bluestones on about a
70 foot diameter around the center of the mound. The entrance was
widened in the ditch bank by about 25 feet and a double row of 10
bluestones was placed in the entrance to the stone circles. This work
was done during about a hundred year period and was never finished due
to some unknown interruption. With their departure, the Stone age closes
3209

in Britain and awaits the coming of the Bronze Age.

                   &quot;Stonehenge III&quot;

The third and final phase in the construction of Stonehenge was
undertaken by the &quot;Wessex People&quot; in about the year 1650 BC. These
people were much more highly skilled than the &quot;Beaker People&quot; and
carried on commerce with the peoples of the Mediterranean area. So many
artifacts are found from these areas that some scientists have developed
the theory that Stonehenge was finished under the auspices of a &quot;Master
Builder&quot; from the Mediterranean. Since this is the only large megalithic
structure attributed to the Wessex People, they may well be correct. The
previous double ring of bluestones were removed and set aside for later
use. They were replaced by a single row of huge sarsen stones coming
from Marlborough Downs. A horseshoe shaped structure consisting of
&quot;trilithons&quot; was placed inside of the sarsens and aligned upon the
northeast opening and the center of the new stone ring. These &quot;tri-
lithons&quot; are not found in other stone circles and are further evidence
of the sophistication of the builders.  The cross pieces are held in
place using a woodworking technique called &quot;mortise and tenon&quot; construc-
tion. All of these stone pieces were hand-worked. The uprights are very
close together (about a foot or less). The outer circle is 97 feet 4
inches in diameter. The outer stones are about 14 feet high by 7 feet
wide by 3 1/2 feet thick. The inner horseshoe is formed by stones
ranging from about 20 to 25 feet high. A temporary structure which was
oval shaped was constructed around the sarsen horseshoe that used the
previously removed bluestones. This oval was removed and the stones were
later used to form a horseshoe of bluestones inside of the sarsen
horseshoe. A number of holes was also dug outside the sarsen circles
called the &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; holes. These are in a pair of roughly circular
rings around the entire structure.  One stone remains to be described
and that is called the &quot;altar stone&quot; though no hole has been found for
it and no use has been clearly defined. It is of a different material
from the sarsens or bluestones.  It came from a quarry 30 miles away and
is of fine grained green sandstone with mica flakes. If clean, it would
glitter in the sunlight. Stonehenge III was completed about 1600 BC and
now we are left with the Mysteries of its construction and use.

      &quot;A Quick Word about Construction&quot;

The construction techniques would take an entire Workshop to cover and
will not be discussed tonight.  I refer you to &quot;Stonehenge Decoded&quot; for
details.  An estimate was made of the effort required using the
conjectured techniques and and estimate of 1,500,000 man days was
determined to be the level of effort required to build Stonehenge. These
techniques were demonstrated using modern day men to determine how many
were actually required for each task. I believe the estimate to be
realistic and accurate. The question remains, &quot;Why undertake such a
truly monumental effort ?&quot;  Although the &quot;Hows&quot; of Stonehenge are
fascinating, I am much more mystified by the &quot;Whys&quot;!

       &quot;A Quick Word about Uses&quot;

I can classify the &quot;Uses&quot; into five categories:
         1. It was used as a Calender to predict the seasons, the phases
of the Moon, and the times of the Sun Festivals.
         2. It was used as a site for performing Ceremonies (everything
from sacrifices to Season fesitivals).
3210

         3. It was used as a Computer to determine Solar and Lunar
eclipses. (The use as a celestial observatory also fits in here).
         4. It was used as a place to work Magick, take shamanistic
journeys (similar to a Native American Medicine Wheel), and was used to
initiate new shamans or priests into the order.
         5. It was used for some other purpose that is subject to
conjecture and awaits the revelations of our own &quot;illuminations&quot;.

I will attempt to provide details about the site that have been
determined by computer analysis and let each of you decide for yoursel-
ves what you think, since tonight we are very limited timewise. We may
return to these topics for additional details in the future.  

                 &quot;The Computer Analysis&quot;

How well did Stonehenge predict the Mid Summer/WInter sunrises and/or
moonrises? When the stone alignments were analyzed by Hawkins in 1961,
using a digital computer borrowed from Havard University. The analsis
showed a TOTAL correlation of all major Sun alignments and an almost
total correlation with alignments of the Moon as well. The accuracy of
these correlations was within 1.5 degrees. The calculations were based
upon the positions of the Sun and Moon circa 1500 BC.  When the various
phases of Stonehenge were considered, it was found that Stonehenge I had
11 key positions that pointed to ten of the twelve extremes of the Sun
and the Moon and Stonehenge III pointed 8 times to 8 of the same key
positions! Needless to say, the position and day of the key Solar/Lunar
days could be easily determined using Stonehenge as a calendar. (I will
construct and upload GIFs showing these alignments to Library 16). The
computer was also used to determine a method where the 56 &quot;Aubrey holes&quot;
were used to predict eclipses. (BTW 56 is also the number of years that
the moon takes to complete its entire cycle through the skies). These
facts have been used to support the arguement that the priests using
Stonehenge could have reinforced their apparant &quot;power&quot; over the
elements by not only predicting the &quot;dreaded&quot; eclipses but also to
&quot;miraculously&quot; cause them to disappear.  I personally couldn't say if
this speculation is valid. It seems rather cynical to me. Another very
interesting fact about the location of Stonehenge is that it is almost
EXACTLY at the right lattitude (51 degrees 17 to allow the Sun and Moon
azimuths to be separated by 90 degrees. It would seem that the site was
NOT chosen at random.  

                 &quot;Shamanistic Flights of Imagination&quot;

Before starting, I'd like to quote the ancient Sicilian historian,
Diodorus about Britain in 50 BC:

&quot;The Moon as viewed from this island appears to be but a little distance
from the Earth and to have on it prominences like those of the Earth,
which are visible to the eye. The account is also given that the god
visits the island every 19 years, the period in wish the stars to the
same place in the heavens is accomplished.  ....There is also on this
island both a magnificient sacred precienct of Apollo and a notable
temple.... and the supervisors are called Boreadae, and succession to
these positions is always kept in their families.&quot;

(BTW the Moon rises farthest to the North every 18 to 19 years as seen
from the center of Stonehenge).

3211

I would like to speculate upon some of the possible Magickal aspects of
Stonehenge:

         1. The site is situated in the midst of a lot of so called
&quot;crop circle&quot; activity. Could the energy of these verified phenomena
also be harnessed by Stonehenge? Could an outbreak of crop circle like
marks have sparked the neolithic people to have constructed their own
more permanent circles?

         2. Is there an Earth power that is yet to be discovered by
modern science. Is this power related to &quot;orgone&quot; as postulated by
Wilhelm Reich from his work with &quot;bions&quot;?  Reich said that this energy
could be seen spiralling into the air through tubes made from organic
matter. His &quot;accumulators&quot; were like batteries for orgone and were made
of alternating layers of organic and inorganic substances (like the
roofs of the great chambers at Bru'gh na Bo'inne).  Guy Underwood was
also a proponent of what he caled &quot;earth force&quot; (also described as being
spiral in nature). Underwood used divining rods to locate pockets of
such energy within Stonehenge.

         3. Is there a &quot;Dragon&quot; or &quot;Serpent&quot; power waiting to be
harnessed within the Earth?  Many of the ancient tombs have such a mark
above their entrys. The Druids certainly believed it was so. Could
ancient kings have married the land here as suggested in Marion Zimmer
Bradley's &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;? I know the area is surrounded by the
burial mounds of many ancient kings.  Is the &quot;Dragon Power&quot; awaiting a
new infusion of energy from a group of dedicated Magickal practitioners.
Does the Dragon sleep?

         4. The many solar/lunar occurences at Stonehenge suggest it may
have been associated with shamanistic practices and initiations in a
manner similar to the areas of the Bru'gh na Bo'inne. Such a practice is
suggested in Douglas Monroe's &quot;The 21 Lessons of Merlin&quot;.  Is Stonehenge
a portal to the Otherworld?

                       &quot;Ley Lines&quot;

One cannot discuss &quot;earth force&quot;, &quot;orgone&quot; or the Earth Power nodes such
as Stonehenge without discussing ley lines. These lines are geomet-
rically located by standing at a Power node and sighting towards other
power nodes. Using such techniques, &quot;ley hunters&quot; have determined that
most of southwestern England is criss crossed by such lines. Are ley
lines &quot;power conduits&quot; between &quot;power nodes&quot;? To answer this question I
read &quot;Earth Memory&quot; and &quot;Shamanism and the Mystery Lines&quot; by Paul
Devereaux, the editor of the &quot;Ley Hunter&quot; magazine and the Director of
the &quot;Dragon Project&quot;. Devereaux has embraced, investigated, evaluated
and rejected more theories about the &quot;ley lines&quot; than anyone else (as
far as I know). He acknowledges that &quot;death roads&quot; do exist near many of
these sites but rejects them as being solely responsible for all ley
lines. (NOTE: death roads are straight roads leading to such ancient
centers for the express purpose of burials and funerary processions.
They are well documented and universal to mankind). His own personal
theory is that the ley lines are the result of shamanistic OOBE
conducted at the so called &quot;power nodes&quot;. The ley lines are the result
of marking in this reality the patways that the shamans take in their
altered reality from one sacred site to another. He suggests that these
&quot;traces&quot; of the Earth's Spiritual Pathways are the means by which we can
become re-attuned to the Earth's Power and ancient knowledge.

Well there we have it, a discussion of Druid Power and Power centers. I
know from my own experience that Magickal Power is stored within my own
Solitary home Circle. How much greater can the True Power be at a site
as special as Stonehenge or Bru'gh na Bo'inne?

      Celtic Workshop #8 - The &quot;Rite of 3 Rays&quot; and the &quot;Gift of Awen&quot;

As usual, we gathered slowly, in fact I was late. After some brief
initial hellos, we got started. Freepowder was still trying to live down
an experience with Coyote (the Trickster) from early in the day!&lt;G&gt; I
discussed the book &quot;The 21 Lessons of Merlin&quot; by Douglas Monroe as an
example of a work produced by &quot;Awen&quot;. I wanted to give the Workshop
members a perspective on the pluses and minuses involved with such
works. I also went over some formal and personal rituals and meditations
I do to receive &quot;illumination&quot;. All in all, a very stimulating evening
of presentation and dialogue......Searles O'Dubhain

Tonight I would like to do things a little differently than I had
planned. Before we discuss the &quot;Rite of 3 Rays&quot; or the &quot;Gift of Awen&quot;,
let's talk about one of the references that I have used and some of you
may have read, &quot;The 21 Lessons of Merlin&quot;.  
 
As we have previously discussed, not much was written down about the
Druids by the Druids. The best we can get is the ancient writings of the
Irish Celtic Culdean Monks who may have been Druids in disguise. Our 
next best sources are oral traditions found in Celtic families, legends
and Bardic lore. Comparative analysis between the other ancient In-
do-European traditions of the Brammans, Greeks, Persians,Egyptians and
the Siberian Shamans may yield some of the hidden Druidic secrets. A lot
of the time we are making some educated guesses based upon how similar
peoples worked Magicks and conducted rituals. Sometimes we have biased
&quot;eye-witnessed&quot; accounts such as Caesar's or the other Roman historians.
When a gap exists in our knowledge of Druidic or Celtic practices we
must do what the ancients did......we must ask that we receive the &quot;Gift
of Awen&quot;. I'll mention some ways that this can happen and what we can do
to aid our quests for &quot;illumination&quot; a little later in our discussion
tonight.
 
What does all this have to do with &quot;the 21 Lessons of Merlin&quot; you ask? 
..... The answer is that this is precisely the approach that Douglas
Monroe seems to have taken in his book. He fills in the gaps with
concepts that have come to him as illuminations and also uses the
illuminations of the &quot;Bardic Mysteries&quot; of Wales (also arrived at by the 
aforementioned methods). Since  we are all humans, some mistakes can
occur when we interpret our &quot;illuminated&quot; thoughts and concepts. This is
precisely why ALL SOURCES should be viewed critically and questioned
(even as our very own Freepowder is prone to do!&lt;G&gt;). I know I constan-
tly question and compare. Monroe's book has some very good concepts in
it and some that I dispute. My primary dispute with him is over his
concepts regarding the sexual polarities and workings of Magick. 
               
He states that Druids were segregated in their Magickal workings because
men and women cannot work together in a symbiotic manner Magickally. He
says that women receive Magick from men but do not return it when a
working is done. This is directly opposite my own experiences where I
have found the presence of women to Powerfully enhance the working of
Magicks.  He also states that male Druids did not marry and were
celibate.  That may be true in Wales, but the Irish Druids married and
3213

had many children.  Abstaining from sex would have severely depleted the
Magickal &quot;gene pool&quot;! The Druids were not stupid! I doubt seriously if
they abstained from sex or procreation! Sex Magick is Big Magick!  (As
I'm sure we will all agree!&lt;G&gt;). So Monroe does make mistakes....so do
it.&lt;G&gt; Time and experimentation are the two best tools to evaluate any
system and the systems of this book will be analyzed fully before we are
done in this series of Workshops.
 
Now I would like to briefly summarize what is in &quot;The 21 Lessons of
Merlin&quot;: 
              1. The 3 Rites of Assumption
 
              This lesson refers to the manner in which a student can
first develop the ability to tap Power and to receive inspirations from
the Higher Consciousness that exist around us. Monroe uses the &quot;Song of
Amergin&quot;, &quot;The Song of Taliesin&quot; and the &quot;Song of Blue Star&quot; to
introduce us to Druidic imagery and visualization.
 
              2. The Pelen Tan
               
              In this lesson, Monroe says that the &quot;Pelen Tan&quot; or a 
kind of glass globe with a candle or light inside of it was used to
create a lighted space under trees that literally caused the area to
glow with a &quot;blue light&quot; (used by male Druids). He also says that the
white robes of the Druids emphasized the &quot;black light&quot; effect of these
fire globes. He says that the female Witches of Avalon used &quot;red lights'
when performing their ceremonies, giving rise to the association of &quot;red
light&quot; districts with prostitution in later ages.
 
              3. The 4 Symbols of Mastery
 
              This lesson is concerned with the development of Magickal 
symbols, arch types and correspondences. The concept of &quot;Mastery&quot; over
the elements is introduced and the need to be creative and original in
all occult work is emphasized.
 
 
              4. The Summoning
 
              A complete rite of Magickal evocation is described here. 
Monroe tells how to call the shades of the dead from their graves. He
introduces the use of  herbs and incense into ritual. The specific shade
being evoked in this ceremony is that of Merlin.
 
              5. The 4 Signs of Portal
 
              This lesson shows how to form a Magickal Circle, to call 
forth the Guardians of the 4 portals to the Otherworld. Symbols are
given for each Quarter (Air, Fire, Water and Earth) as well as the
symbols for the &quot;Sign of Three Rays&quot; that represents Spirit or Akasha
(similar to the Pentagram). The Old ones called are Uscias, Semias,
Esras and Morfessa of the Magickal cities of the North. The God in the
form of Herne is also invoked.
 
              6. The 4 Sacraments of the Earth
 
              The concepts of sacrifice to the elements upon a &quot;Sun&quot; day
is presented. (Not human sacrifice BTW).
3214

              7. The 8 Grove Festivals
 
              The eight major grove festivals of Samhain, Imbolc,
Beltaine, Lughnasadh as well as the Mid-Winter, Mid-Summer Solstices and
the Equinoxes are described. Some of the special items associated with
each festival are given.
 
              8. The 16 Leeches of Diancecht
 
              The use of herbs in Druidic ceremonies and practices is 
introduced. A discussion of Reincarnation is given and a Magickal
journey is undertaken using these herbs.

              9. The Rite of 3 Rays
 
              A means of achieving protection is described. The rite is 
likened to the Ceremonial Magick rite of the Banishing Rituals of the
Pentagram as practiced by the Golden Dawn.
 
              10. The Battle of the Trees
 
              The Oghams are discussed and the &quot;Battle of the Trees&quot; is 
described. A battle between wizards occurs and the Magick of the trees
is used to defeat Merlin's adversary, just as the tree Magick was used
to defeat invaders during the Cad Goddeu (circa 400 BC). One of the nine
draughts of inspiration is described that will allow the Druid to
commune more thoroughly with the spirits of the trees.
 
................................................................................
3215
              11. The 8 Songs of Cycle
 
              The correspondences of the Oghams to music and the use of
music in Magickal acts is presented. The use of musical instruments is
described for the various elements and a tie between the Druids and
Atlantis is suggested.
 
              12. The Herbs of Continence
 
              This lesson centers around Monroe's belief that Druids 
segregated by sexes for education, Magick and workings. He describes a
concept called &quot;Duality&quot;. He uses a trip to the Sisterhood of Avalon
(Glastonbury) to present his case. He also advocates celibacy for male
Druids but not for the Sisters (beyond Maidenhood). Four herbal concoc-
tions are presented that enhance male sexual powers.
 
              13. The Gateway Rite
 
              A visit to Stonehenge is described. The history and lore 
of the site is mentioned with references to Atlanteans, Hyberboreans and
even the Tuatha de Dannan. A method of merging with the consciousness of
inanimate objects is also described.
 
              14. The Dragon's Eye
 
              The act of creating Druid fire is mentioned during a visit
to the Isle of Wight. The ley lines and the Power of the Land are called
Dragon Power during this lesson. A rite that allows one to &quot;call the
Dragon&quot; is presented and the symbol for the &quot;Dragons Eye&quot; is drawn.
 
              15. The Rite of Inspiration
 
              The use of meditation and Magickal Circles is described to
allow one to receive enlightenment to the Awen (the inner spirit that is
illuminated). Two rituals are given and the connection between the Sun
and Awen is given.
 
 
              16. The Wild Hunt
 
              The use of the Mandragon herb is described during a
shamanic contest between the Druid and the forces of Nature (usually
done during Samhain). The gains and losses of such a competition are
mentioned.
 
              17. The Life Board
 
              A Magickal symbol for the Three Circles of Existence 
(Ceugant, Gwyned and Abred) is given. Fionn's ladder is discussed. The
use of such an empowered Magickal Symbol for makings and pathworkings is
described.
 
              18. The Rite of Libation
 
              A  variety of Druidic draughts is given.

(2-10,Trailstalker) RE #16:  I thought that Druids were in alignment
with Nature.  What are they contesting?
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    This particular lesson is about being in the Woods
3216

during the Wild Hunt of Gwynn ap Nudd when the raw primal forces of
Nature heighten one's inner fears.

(2-22,O'Dubhain)    It's a rite of Mastery whereby the young Druidic
Initiate masters himself and faces the power of Nature, the winds, the
Darkness, the lightnings and such.  So it's really a test to see how in
tune you are with Nature.

              19. The Threshold Rite
 
              The use of herbs and incense to enhance a journey to the
Otherworld is given.
 
              20. The Triscale Stones
 
              Divination using stones is presented. A pathworked trip to
the Otherworldly city of Caer Idris is made to show the origins of the
technique. The suggestion is given to find one's personal &quot;oracle tree&quot;
under which divinations will be optimized. 
 
              21. The Rite of the Active Door
 
              The secrets of color and the concepts of invisibility are
given along with a ritual that opens all occult knowledge to the Druid.
This Ritual is the rite of passage to the Inner Mysteries.

If you read this book, you'll see that the Druids are presented doing
Magicks that harm others at times.  Some of the Druids even do battle!
This certainly violates the Wiccan Rede that states &quot;Do what you will if
you harm none&quot;&gt; The fact is that Druids were not Witches and they
frequently did battle as well as aiding their clans and kings in war.
The great Druid Amergin aided the Mileseans in their battles with the 
Tuatha de Dannan. Many other examples exist of Druids harming plenty,
least of all none. Druids were definitely not Wiccans. Monroe's book
follows this philosophy, so some may call it &quot;unethical&quot;. He also
advocates the use of a variety of naturals drugs to aid in Magicks, 
meditations and Illuminations. I personally think these practices are a
matter of individual judgement and neither recommend nor reject them. Do
what you will. The choice is yours.
 
                       &quot;The Rite of Three Rays&quot;
 
     This Ritual is similar to the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the
Pentagram and the Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram performed during
Ceremonial Magick and Ritual by the Golden Dawn as outlined by Donald
Craig or Israel Regardie. Monroe gives his version of this ritual in his
book &quot;the 21 Lessons of Merlin&quot;. I haven't found any historical support
for it in my Celtic references but it seems to be typical of what I
think a Druid might do. (The Ritual smacks of Egyptian/Thelemic Magickal
practice IMHO).  Monroe likens the 3 Rays or gestures in this ritual to
the first 3 Rays of the Mid-Summer Sun over the horizon (the Celts
called this Awen as well).
 
     This ritual is primarily used to generate Power within the Druid
for protection or receiving &quot;illumination&quot; according to Monroe.  It uses
the vibratory energies of sound coupled with the physical act of deep
breathing and communing with the Sun to create an &quot;altered state&quot; within
the Druid.
3217

     Here's the basic steps of the ritual:
 
               1. Stand in direct sunlight (noon if you can do it).
 
               2. Close your eyes and breathe deeply to relax and start
the path to a meditative state.
 
               3. Once you are relaxed, exhale then breathe in deeply as
you raise your hands above your head.
 
               4. Slowly lower your arms while intoning loudly,
&quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE&quot; or &quot;I&quot; (The name of Isis in CM or Golden Dawn, this is
the invocation of the Goddess Power). Bring your arms to your sides.
     
               5. Repeat this step while intoning &quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh&quot; or
&quot;A&quot; for Apophis the Destroyer. Monroe calls this the &quot;Crystal Ray&quot; or
Ray of Balance and Separation. He says this represents  both Male and
Female energies and also neither (sounds a lot like the Book of the
Law).
 
               6. Repeat again while intoning &quot;OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&quot; or &quot;O&quot;
for the Male God Osiris. This invokes the God Power to your aid.
 
               7. repeat the arm gestures a final time while intoning
&quot;IAO&quot; or &quot;EEEEEEE-Ahhhhhhh-OOOOOOOO!&quot; Then open your eyes.
 
 
     At this point the energy has been raised and the work is to be
done. One could shield from Magickal attack or seek the &quot;Gift of Awen&quot;
or some other Magickal act.  Monroe doesn't state this but I recommend
&quot;grounding&quot; afterwards and if possible. Do this by eating and drinking
a lite meal. (I never recommend doing any Magick on a full stomach).
Wiccans do similar rituals using athames, wands and swords to draw
Circles and/or Pentagrams for protection and Ritual. This ritual is nice
because the 3 movements are tied to the 3 Rays of Awen.  (As with all
Magick, ritual is very personal, if it feels right do it!&lt;G&gt;). Monroe
says that one could reverse the direction of the arm movements and the
intonations to &quot;banish&quot; energies that are directed at you. He also says
that one could only do the &quot;male&quot;, the &quot;female&quot; or the &quot;crystal&quot;
movements depending on what is needed or banished.  He suggests
experimenting as do I. I'd next like to discuss some ways that I achieve
&quot;illuminated states&quot;.
 
(2-24,Nan)          how would you describe the basic differences/simila-
rities between Wicca and Druidry? (25 words or less &lt;g&gt;)
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    The Druids use the Sun and the Moon.  And the Druids
were more political back then.  Nowadays I'd say that the Druids tend to
be more left brained than the Wiccans and they tend to be more bilateral
with their Deity worship.

(2-24,Nan)          a point of clarification for me .......Wicca doesn't
use the sun?
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    Most of the major Wiccan celebrations are done under
the Moon. The Sun is also used but does not play as great a role as in
Druidry.

(2-6,Heather &amp; Michel) We have both Wiccans &amp; Druid here, so perhaps we
can clarify...
3218

(2-22,O'Dubhain)    good
(2-6,Heather &amp; Michel) 
     Wicca uses the sun as much as Druidism. Moon is primarily for
esbats... Wiccans don't tend to be culturally specific with their
worship,  while Druids go for mostly celtic stuff and only share 4 of...
Wicca's 8 festivals.  (At least how we do it.) ... ga
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    ok!! seems to be a diversity of opinions and
practices as usual! thanks

(2-10,Trailstalker) Where would &quot;shamanism&quot; fit in with all of this?  We
do ceremony under the Sun, the Moon, the Stars,... in swamps, forests,
deserts, living rooms, ... you get the picture... and what's an
&quot;esbats&quot;?
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    Shamanism comes in when you seek assistance from the
Spirit world or you seek to control the elements.  Esbats are Full Moon
Wiccan Rituals held every month Sabbats are Major festivals like we
outlined previously 
(2-10,Trailstalker) I've found that with shamanism if you are seriously 
working the path, there comes a time when rather than you working it and
using medicine items, you more or less become a medicine item for a
Greater spirit power.  And it works through  you.

(2-17,Freepowder)   I remember, Druids are left brain based on Bonewits?
or others too?
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    Actually Druids are both sided. I think some Wiccans
tend to reject the left side approach at times Bonewits seems to be left
brain heavy!&lt;G&gt; IMHO!

(2-17,Freepowder)   modern druids, as previously cited?
(2-22,O'Dubhain)    yes.... Modern Druids.

     The ancients were a lot more in tune with their entire minds They
didn't really draw a line as such. To receive the &quot;Gift of Awen&quot;
requires us to achieve heightened or altered states of consciousness.
First let's describe what an altered state is. An altered state of
consciousness is just that, a different state from that which we
normally experience. This can be anything from a heightened awareness of
our physical surrounding to a totally different way of perceiving 
all of reality. I have basically recognized the following states in
myself:
     
                  1. Sensing the mood or spirit of the land around me,
the trees, the streams, animals, the wind, the soul of the Earth. This
state is achieved by quieting the spirit and/or the mind. Being at peace
allows the world around us to communicate and touch us. I do this by
relaxing and releasing my thoughts and emotions. I float and accept. I
observe what IS. Not what I expect to see. Reality is as it is and not
filtered by my conditioning.
 
                  2. Having access to the Akasha for inspiration and
divination. (Usually coming in flashes.) I blank my mind in a manner
similar to the above process but usually do this in a secluded room
without light and external distractions. I fix my purpose in my mind and
seek for an answer. I do not allow anything to distract me. When my
answer comes, I can immediately recognize it.
  
                  3. Being out of &quot;time sync&quot; with others. Being
slightly in the future of what's happening around me. This usually 
3219

happens to me without trying and sometimes accompanies other heightened
states. It also happens when I've taken anything with codeine in it.
 
                  4. Seeing &quot;visions&quot;, things that are happening in the
future or the past as if they are happening right now. This state comes
on me when I have a quest that requires me to see through a different
set of eyes or a different point of view. I actually let myself just
look into another world or time through the eyes of a native being
(sometimes me or a relative, sometimes an artificial construct.)
 
                  5. Sensing people from previous lives. I usually have
no control of this. It just happens and can be triggered by some
familiar gesture word or other similar event. I just feel very at ease
and comfortable (or hostile at times) with the person I've known before.
                  
                  6. Reading minds. (This also just happens). This is
not in words. It is in images and feelings. I just know what someone is
thinking or feeling.
                  
                  7. Going out of the body. I have to relax totally,
isolate all external distractions. I start at my extremities and work
inward. (Did I mention that I am lying down on a comfy surface?) I
release all the tension in my physical body first. I next calm my
emotions, then my thoughts.  Once I only exist within my head, I start
releasing all external inputs. I shut down all my creative centers. I
turn off all the monitoring that goes on. I relax and float. If Thoughts
or emotions enter in, I sink them into the Earth away from me. I banish
them. I float. Once I am completely isolated and floating in total
darkness, I try to see behind me and in front of me at the same time.
This is not possible while embracing the normal physical existence. It 
can only be done in our Spirit forms. This takes total concentration and
practice. Not force, just persistence and release. I liken this process
to what happens when one is born. A long persistent pushing through the 
birth canal surrounding us. The physical barriers thin out before our
efforts and suddenly we are born anew on the Astral plane.  I can then
see in all directions at the same time I am aware of all around me.
Physical barriers are only thought forms to be ignored at Will. I can go
anywhere I desire to go. (However I am only a child in this existence
and am also very aware of the far greater Powers around me). I exercise
extreme caution when traveling the Astral. It is very easy to be
&quot;noticed&quot; and to become the object of unwanted attentions. My conscious
mind distracts me continually as I maintain a hold on my physical
existence. When i return to me body, I actually have to struggle back
into it! Part of me wants to stay on the Astral. The barriers that
separate and protect us from Astral Intrusions are tough to penetrate
even when we hold the keys! Be careful and cautious and you can learn a
lot. Slip for a minute and you can be trapped, possessed or lost.
                  
                  8. Communing with the God/esses.
 
     I commune with the God/esses in several ways. I recognize that all
things have life and Power within them. I especially feel a closeness to
trees, plants, rivers and lakes. The ocean just overwhelms me with it's
Power. The clouds constantly change in their forms and interactions.
Celts believe that places have Spirits. I am a Celt ,by birth but also
because I feel this Oneness and connection to Nature. You can be a
Brother or Sister the same way. Birth is unimportant. Who we are in the
Spirit is very important. The first way to commune with the Spirits
3220

is through Nature. When in this state my physical senses are extremely
heightened.
                  
The next way to commune with the God/desses is through Ritual. In Ritual
we open the Pathways within us to be filled with the One Power. We
invite It within and share Its Touch. Magick is nothing more than
specialized Ritual and is a focusing of the Power. We can actually
become the God or the Goddess or some Other at these times. They can
have a physical body through us. I have sat back at such times and been
amazed at the words pouring forth from my mouth from the Energy that
possesses me. This Power is benevolent and will vanish anytime we
reassert ourselves. I caution those who would try this to be CERTAIN
that they are within a Sacred Space and are Protected before opening up
to a Spirit Entity.  All Spirits are not benevolent and some WILL try to
violate your presence and assume complete control of your body. It
happens all the time. Watch the news and see for yourself. When out of
the body and feeling no constraints, it is possible to experience the
touch of the God/desses. I have felt Their Wonderful Presences filling
me. I usually feel Their approach as a feeling of tremendous anticip-
ation. I sense that something monumental is going to occur. Something
coming to me. The space around my spirit  begins sparkling in golden 
crystals. Then I experience a thrill of Joy and Happiness. I am
completed and embraced by the Knowledge of the Ages and The Love of my
Fellow Spirit. It's beyond words but so very uplifting, comforting and 
peaceful. I feel that I am where I should be. My sense of my life's
purpose and my need to finish my work on this plane pulls me back. I
also feel that I need to share myself with those on the physical plane
I love. I cannot yet abandon the world of form. I bid Them adieu in
Perfect Love and struggle back into my body. I carry Their Blessings and
Love within. I try to share this in my life with others.
                  
                  9. Working with Power.
     
I always work within a Circle when using Power. This can be a Circle
surrounding my person in an emergency. I prefer to use traditional
methods to create Circles more formally. Circles tend to hold residuals
of the Spells of Protection that are cast for them. My Circle at home is
such a place. Anyone can enter it but only those that are invited may
work with Power there. Sleeping within this Circle is guaranteed to make
you travel and have the strangest of dreams!&lt;G&gt;
 
To use Power I merely open myself to it. No meditation is necessary,
though it helps me to be more sensitive to the nuances of Power. All I
really need is a Magickally isolated place, a Circle. Once I am open, I
reach for the Power of the Earth and the Sky. I let the Energy flow
through me. (It feels like it comes into my feet and out of my hands and
head! This is similar to the way lightning flows.) I leave the stream
open and charge myself as full as I can get. My hair usually stands up
a bit and I get all &quot;goose pimply&quot;! I keep in mind the goal of my
working and I release the Power I've stored. (At the same time the Power
leaves me, I see it going as a beam of energy. If the Working is large
or systemic, I tie the beam to the same source I've tapped. This permits
it to continue after I've released it. (I actually visualize the beam
remaining and pumping the energy out.) I leave the beam with a spell
that allows it to quit when the Work is done. I release the Power back
to the Earth and Sky and thank the God/dess for their help. It helps to
eat or drink or something equally grounded in Physical Reality after
such an effort.

                  10. Dying.
 
This is the Ultimate altered state. I myself have never actually died in
this lifetime yet. I have been at the Portal many times. I have sensed
the Ways to Tir na Nog. Always when I am close I sense a peace and a
surrender within me to the call of the Guardian of the Door. I actually
laugh from happiness. I have been told to return to this life because my
Work is not yet done. I have spoken to members of my own family about
their near death experiences and they are remarkably similar. A
releasing and a faith in what will come. A sensing that all is right and
that the Ultimate Will Accomplishes Its Purpose. I have read many books
and accounts of the experiences of others who have gone through that
door and returned. My belief in the Afterlife is strengthened by their
revelations. The ancient Celts and Druids believed so strongly in such
an afterlife that they sometimes chose to voluntarily accompany their
loved ones through the Door. Druids would even borrow money to be repaid
in another life! Needless to say their strong beliefs in another Life
after this One caused the Celts to have no fear of Death!&lt;G&gt;
 
I have watched the Spirits of those I love leave their bodies and have
seen the Light that surrounds them in Happiness. I have seen their
smiles to have finished their Work and receive their New Lives. Death is
no End, Death is an Accomplishment and a Release.
 
How do we tell when these states occur? We don't have to!!!  We are in
them! They happen to us and we react to them!! We can't mistake them!!
They are beyond all Time and Space!
 
Seriously, If you are in one of these states, you feel very &quot;charged up&quot;
and full of energy. You sense an Exaltation of the Spirit. You are
extremely &quot;Alive&quot;! You will know and You will enjoy!&lt;G&gt;
 
How do we induce altered states of consciousness? The answer to this is
that we &quot;open&quot; ourselves up to them. We release our grasp on the Normal
state of Consciousness.  We expand ourselves to the limits that are
actually there and not the ones we are conditioned to accept. Seeing
things that can't exist in Normal Reality helps sometimes. It shakes us
out of our conditioning. This can be as simply as seeing a glorious
Sunset or as strange as seeing a UFO or a Demon. I have achieved altered
states through meditation, drugs, Circles, Rituals, Drumming, Singing,
Reading, Dreaming, Involuntary or accidental occurrences, sickness and
by being Possessed. I don't recommend narcotics or heavy drugs, sickness
or Possession. Incenses and herbal drinks are ok though. (We'll discuss
these next week).
              
              &quot;Practical Meditation for Awen&quot;
 
I'll try to elaborate a little here on the practical side of meditation.
I usually meditate lying down with my head to the North and my body
relaxed. If I am in Ritual I can Meditate while standing or kneeling.
The most important aspect to remember is to relax each part of your body
and mind. I usually start at my extremities (feet and hands). I tell
myself, &quot;Relax your right foot, relax your left foot, relax your.... and
so on. I release all the tension in each part and let it flow out. I do
this several times until I don't feel my body any longer. Next I start
on my breathing and my heartbeat until they are automatic and transpar-
ent. Then I quiet my thoughts until only Darkness persists. Next I try
to ignore the Darkness until I am floating. To go further requires 
3222

additional techniques. At this point I am a blank tablet and can just
rest or I can receive &quot;messages&quot; from Others. It's very important to be
where you are absolutely secure from unwelcome intrusions of the Spirit
or the Physical at this time. Without such a safe place, you will always
be slightly on your guard. It helps if another Being you trust will
watch over you at this time. This can be anyone from an elemental, a
totemic animal, a Spirit Guide, a person to a God/dess.  Just thinking
about how it feels to meditate and then writing this answer, makes me
meditate.&lt;G&gt; I guess that remembering how it felt to meditate makes it
easier to meditate the next time you try! Practice makes Perfect!&lt;G&gt;
              
                             &quot;Druidic Meditation&quot;
 
Some of this material was covered previously but I repeat it here for
clarity and the benefit of those that may no have seen that particular
Workshop yet!&lt;G&gt; Druidic meditation was usually done for divination and
foretelling the future. This was called by the names: Tenm Laida,
Dichetal Do Chennaib and Imbas Forosna.
              
Tenm Laida (Illumination by Song) is an altered state usually achieved
by chanting or singing of a repetitive pattern. This can also include
drumming and dancing. These activities synchronize the body and mind to
an external rhythm allowing us to cast off the chains of normal
existence. This allows you to float at peace within the song (dance,
beat, mantra, etc.) This is a strictly Druidic or Shamanistic practice
even though it may look like TM.
                  
Dichetal Do Chennaib (Cracking  open the Nuts of Wisdom) is a state
achieved by relaxation and clearing the mind in a Ritual environment. It
usually involved using some Magickal implement such as a knife, a sword
or a staff to touch a subject (usually upon the head) or by handling an
item to discover what secret knowledge was contained within it. This
information could be events from a person's past life, a detailed
history of who and what had happened to an object or how and why the
subject was being hexed or spelled. I know this sounds like ESP but it
was enhanced through Ritual and relaxation techniques.
              
Imbas Forosna (Illumination) was a form of altered state used by seers
and bards to create or see visions. The Druid would be totally isolated
from all sensory inputs, sounds, lights and feelings. This was usually
a very dark room or a covering of hides. The Druid would attempt to
float and relax. When in the proper state he would signal for the hides
to be removed or he would open the door out of the Darkness. The sudden,
instantaneous transition from Darkness to Light would cause them to see
visions or to spontaneously utter poems, prophecies or achieve a total
Awareness of the secret Knowledge of their Surroundings. This sensory
deprivation It was their Ultimate Meditation technique.
              
The Druids also used music, colors, trees and numbers to alter their
consciousness. They were familiar with the Pythagorean Mysteries and may
have actually been the source of them!&lt;G&gt;
              
Druids shared IndoEuropean roots with the Indian Brahmans but I don't
have any hard data to support any similarities in their practices.
          
                                     &quot;Drugs&quot;
              
I have experienced Magickal states from drugs but I don't think the 
3223

technique is sufficiently controllable or repeatable. It's like playing
your Steinway with a sledgehammer. Sure you can play a song but at what 
cost to the instrument? Plus I find that the songs are usually more
sophisticated if I don't use the sledge!&lt;G&gt;
              
I would caution anyone using drugs to know their track records, side
effects and purity before starting. Then do them under gradually
increasing controlled and supervised conditions. Never experiment with
drugs. 
There is always a documented lab record of their effects. Know your
suppliers and don't get the wrong ones! The best recommendation is don't
do drugs. Your Mind, Body and Spirit can achieve better and more lasting
results. (As I mentioned previously, some natural herbal drinks and
incenses seem to aid meditation and ritual. We'll discuss those next
week).  Well there we have it!  All the different ways to achieve
illumination to Awen!

(End of Celtic Workshop #8 - The &quot;Rite of 3 Rays&quot; and the &quot;Gift of
Awen&quot;)
        &quot;Celtic Workshop #9 -  The use of Herbs and Potions&quot;
        
The role of herbs in healing, Magick, ceremonies and rituals as well as
in mind alteration were presented and discussed in detail. The effects
of the most popular Druidic herbs and potions were detailed and
discussed. Some reformatting was done on the transcript for clarity's
sake as well. A final note!!!! Please exercise caution around most of
these herbs!! Some of them are considered to be POISONS! The effects of
some of the others are very powerful in areas of &quot;mind alteration&quot;.  The
author of one of the texts, used as a reference, presents his suggested
methods for how the Druids used these herbs (they are ONLY used in a
greatly dilluted state!). Once again I urge caution and good judgement
before proceeding. All in all, the Workshop participants evidenced a
very thorough respect and understanding of the use and effects of these
herbs.

Entering Workshop/Seminar 1 room...

                      &quot;Druidic Use of Herbs&quot;
 
We must look at many sources to determine how the Druids used drugs and
herbs. Some of these sources are historical (such as the Greek and Roman
historians). Other sources are the traditions of the Bards and Seanchai.
Still others are the folk remedies and fables of the major Celtic areas
of the world (Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Britain).  We can also look
to information that comes from the inspired &quot;Awen&quot; of others (such as
Llewellyn Sion of Glamorgan and Douglas Monroe).  Archaelogical evidence
is also being found (the bodies of sacrificial or other burial victims
have been recently discovered). Each of these types of sources will be
matched against the others (where possible) to give us the best possible
idea of how Druids worked with drugs and herbs.
 
A quote from one the ancients, Pliny, a Roman, referring to the Druid
veneration of mistletoe:
 
&quot;Seldom was the Mistletoe found growing upon the Oak, but on such
occasion, the Druids gathered it with due religious ceremony, (if
possible on the 6th day of the new Moon-when the influence of the orb
was waxing, and said to be at its height.  Following an elaborate 
3224

banquet, a white-clad priest cut the plant from  the oak tree with a
golden sickle, while another Druid held out a white cloak for its
reception. They believed that the Mistletoe, immersed in water within a
cauldron, would impart fecundity to barren animals, and that it is the
antidote for all poisons - its name meaning 'all healing.'&quot;

Many of the herbs can be had from your local health food store as well
or can be ordered from the

                      (This is Run by Douglas Monroe I believe.)

(2-1,Freepowder)      there are 2 varietys of Mistletoe.... american and
european, the effects of them are almost opposite... european lowers BP,
american raises.... the *berries* of either are deadly poisonous. GA

(2-11,Rhianna)        Foxglove is another example - Digitalis (which
comes from (foxglove) is a poison, yet it's used for treating heart
patients.

(2-28,cherokee)       my gt grandma used mistle toe to bring prople out
of fevers and unconsciousness.  aspirin bark is poisonous too. its all
in how you prepare it

                      &quot;The 16 Leeches of Diancecht&quot;
 
Diancecht was the physician of the Tuatha de Dannan.  He healed their
wounded during and after their Battles with the Fomorai and the
Firbolgs. He is the God of Herbs and Medicines.
 
The following list contains herbs listed in &quot;the 21 Lessons of Merlin&quot;
and contains their correspondences to the four elements as well as their
applications. How to prepare a suitable &quot;store&quot; of these medicines is
also given. The recommended dossages are also given.  Note: Some of
these herbs can be considered &quot;POISONS&quot;!  I heartily recommend using
extreme caution with them. I have attempted to identify those that may
be considered harmful. Please proceed at your own risk. I must say that
3225

generally Monroe stays away fron poisonous herbs in topical or internal
medicines. He does use some very dangerous substances in some of his
recommended incenses. a long list will follow please bear with me!&lt;G&gt;

                   &quot;The 16 Leeches of Diancecht&quot;

heal&quot;.
 
                      &quot;Draughts of Inspiration&quot; (Only one is given)
 
These drinks are thought to instill the correct state of mind  required
for &quot;Awen&quot;. According to Monroe, nine exist in total, though only one is
given in his book. Perhaps we can discover the others? I suggest that
the other tree barks that were used are from the red chestnut, white
chestnut, Elm, Beech, Larch, Oak and Fir trees. I would guess these
based upon Hints contained in &quot;Practical Celtic Magick&quot; by Murry Hope.
I also would guess that ivy was used in a draught based upon information
from Scott Cunningham's &quot;Encyclopedia of Magickal Herbs&quot;.
 
                          5 tablespoons of spring water
                          1 pinch Evening Primrose Flowers
                          1 pinch Black Willow Bark
                          1 pinch Thyme
 
sit in Glass bottle (closed in the Sun) for 3 days strain/ add 1 tsp
apple cider vinegar before use add 1 tsp chlorophyll (alfalfa) take 3
drops subligually prior to Magickal Workings with trees/plants.
 
                        &quot;Threshold Smoke&quot;
 
These concotions are used to aid one in having an Otherworldly ex-
perience. They are cast upon the flames of a fire. Please note that some
of the ingredients are POISON! and that another one of them is con-
sidered &quot;illegal&quot;. The use of these herbs are indicated to aid solitary
meditations in the deep woods. Be aware that they will induce &quot;Dark
Visions&quot; and reveal your inner fears. According to Monroe, the Druids
required one to master such fears to be in tune with Nature and to
achieve &quot;Balance&quot;..I recommend that none of them be tried when unsuper-
vised and I also recommend extreme caution.
 
                      To make the incense:
 
                              Blend and compound the following plants:
                              Neckweede (Hemp)
                              Nightshade (Belladonna) (poison) 
                              Ghostflower (Datura)
                      Keep in a dark (light free) box.
 
                      Burn as an incense to facilitate &quot;threshold&quot; 
                      and &quot;traveling&quot; works.
 
3227

                          &quot;The Spirit of the Mandrake&quot;
 
This incense is used to attain a state of altered consciousness for
resolving one's inner fears and becoming one with the Spirit of the Land
and its animal Nature. I caution anyone considering using it to be aware
that Mandrake is considered a POISON! This herb is used during the Night
of the Wild Hunt that we discussed last week.
 
Toss dried Mandrake (poison) root upon a bed of hot coals or embers and
let the smoke cause you to travel within the darkness of the night. May
apple, Peony; Ginseng or Briony roots may be substituted (also con-
sidered poisonous!).
 
                     &quot;The Song of Bluestar&quot;
Another herb used to achieve altered states was the Bluestar flower or
the Blue Morning Glory. This  plant is considered poisonous! Do not eat
or drink anything made with it and handle it with care. Monroe suggests
drying the flowers and seeds to make an incense for a rite of assumption
or tapping into Powers. This  might also be called &quot;mind expansion&quot;. 
(The same plants have been used to create LSD in recent times, so I am
not surprised that they are used here). I'm not advocating that anyone
of you try this incense, but Monroe says the Druids did. I'm not
surprised.
 
Here is the essence of the trip or rite of assumption:
 
&quot;I will be as a Bluestar upon a field of Green, circling upward towards
a golden Sun.&quot;
                      .... translation by D.W.Nash
 
The Druids believed all life was interrelated from the lowest forms to
the highest. This quote from the ancient Welsh document, the Mathnawai, 
shows their philosopy:
 
                      &quot;I died as a mineral and became a plant,
                      I died as a plant and rose to an animal,
                      I died as an animal and I was a man.
                      Why should I fear?
                      When was I ever less dying?
                      Yet once more I shall die as a man,
                      to soar in the Blessed Realm;
                      but even from godhood
                      I must pass on....&quot;

One further quote from &quot;The Gorchan of Maeldrew&quot;:  &quot;Each atom an
evolving life, each blade of grass a potential soul.&quot;

               &quot;The Draughts of Oblivion&quot;
 
I give here the &quot;fast&quot; (meaning quick to make) version of Celtic drinks
and libations from the &quot;21 Lessons of Merlin&quot; as well as the festivals
at which they are used:

                          week. Filter through muslin and bottle.      
                        Garnish with raisins and cloves before         
                     serving.
 
                              Midwinter Mulsa
 
Add a half ounce of each of the following to 2 quarts of your favorite
dry white wines:              crushed juniper berries, wintergreen,
                              Elder Flowers. let sit for about 6 hours. 
                              Filter and chill before serving. Garnish 
                              with a sprigg of green pine or hot with  
                            a cinnamon stick

Now these are drinks I can get excited about!  I think we can all see
that Druids used a variety of herbs in their work....from &quot;visions&quot; to
partying.

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         Celtic Workshop #10 - 
                   The Act of &quot;Becoming&quot; and The Charm of &quot;Summoning&quot;
        
Tonight's workshop is advertised to cover the following topics and I
intend to give them all my best efforts at explanation.  Tonight's
topics are:

               How to actually influence your surroundings. 

          How to perform Weather Magick, to call animals to you, to
improve your crops and to influence the outcome of events. 
  
          How to discover your past life, find your Inner Teacher or
Self. 
  
          How to summon &quot;Spirits&quot; to your presense.

I am being ambitious in talking about these topics!&lt;G&gt; I trust we can
cover them all tonight and I also hope to have many contributions by all
of you regarding your own personal experiences in these areas. We will
learn from our &quot;Inner Druids&quot;! &lt;G&gt;

The key words to remember tonight are &quot;Becoming&quot; and &quot;Summoning&quot;. They
along with &quot;Will&quot; and &quot;Authority&quot; are the basis of most Druidic and
Celtic Magicks.

What do I mean by &quot;Becoming&quot;? What does this act have to do with Magick?
How did Druidsdo this? I asked myself all of these questions before
making this act a topic for tonight's workshop. The inspiration for the
act of &quot;Becoming&quot; is the &quot;Song of Amergin&quot; from the ancient Irish
manuscript the Leabhar Gabha'la (Book of Invasions). Hear now the words
of the Druid Amergin:

                        &quot;             The Mystery

                         I am the wind which breathes upon the sea.
                         I am the wave of the ocean.
                         I am the murmur of the billows.
                         I am the ox of the seven combats.
                         I am the vulture upon the rocks.
                         I am a beam of the Sun.
                         I am the fairest of plants.
                         I am a wild boar in valour.
                         I am a salmon in the water.
                         I am a lake in the plain.
                         I am a word of science.
                         I am a point of the lance in battle.
                         I am the God who created in the head the fire.
                         Who is it who throws light into the meeting 
                         on the mountain?
                         Who announces the ages of the Moon?
                         Who teaches the place where couches the Sun?
3230
                                                          (If not I)&quot;

This was the translation by Dr. Douglas Hyde from his work &quot;Literary
History of Ireland&quot;. This poem was once as well known in the Celtic
world as the &quot;Lord's Prayer&quot; is in today's world. It is said to be the
first verse made by the Mileseans as they arrived in Ireland (circa 1000
BC). This is also an incantation by a mighty Druid and is a good
illustration of the act of &quot;Becoming&quot;. Amergin is using the Magickal Law
of Identification that is given by Isaac Bonewits in his book &quot;Real
Magick&quot;:

&quot;The Law of Identification ...states that by maximum association between
your metapattern and that of another entity, you can actually &quot;become&quot;
that entity and wield its power.&quot;

Bonewits is a Neo Druid and the founder of the group A'r nDrai'ocht
Fe'in (ADF for short though it really means &quot;Our Druidic Magick&quot; in
Gaeilge).  This act of &quot;Becoming&quot; is one that is not lightly undertaken.
The danger exists of being trapped within the other entity (whether
natural, human or spiritual). I suggest you not actually try this sort
of thing until you know your True Will (exactly who you really are
without self delusion).  This was also true of the Greek and the
Egyptian Mysteries. Their first and major requirement was &quot;Gnothi se
auton&quot;, literally &quot;Know thyself&quot;! The ability to control and return to
one's being is linked directly to one's knowledge of Self. Sometimes
this process goes the otherway as well, as when a Wiccan &quot;Draws Down the
Moon&quot;. The threefold Goddess actually Manifests within the High
Priestess (HPS) in such a ceremony. She who has no Name is benevolent,
usually, so that this possession results in the HPS afterwards being
returned to control of her own body. &quot;Becoming&quot; is a two way street and
a matter of &quot;Will&quot;.  

Now that we know a little about the act of &quot;Becoming&quot;, I think you can
appreciate just how great a Druid that Amergin was....he &quot;became&quot;
multiple entities at the same time in his Invocation of the Mystery. He
controlled all of these elemental powers and made them his own. This act
of Power allowed the Mileseans to land upon Eireann though they were
opposed by the Magicks of the Tuatha de Danaan. He also lived to do
other Magicks (though I must say that his invocation of Ireland is
rumored to have caused him to marry and join the de Danaan within the 
spirit world of the Sidhe). We must remember that Amergin was a Druid
and so had studied his arts intensivly for anywhere from 12 to 20 years
as a minimum. He was able to return to hinself after such Magical
Working because he knew his True Self and Will. This strong connection
is the Way of Return for us all. I urge that you all exercise due
caution when &quot;Becoming&quot;. Know yourself first.

Another saying worthy of note while discussing the act of &quot;Becoming&quot; is
a common saying of the ancient world that I quote from Doreen Valiente's
book &quot;Natural Magic&quot;: &quot;Ten measures of magic were given to the world.
Egypt took nine. The rest took one.&quot;

I include this saying here to establish one other connection....that of
the Druids to the Egyptians. The lineage of Amergin and the Gaels
includes his mother Scota (daughter of the Egyptian Pharoh) as well as
Mile and Niall &quot;of the Languages&quot; a Scythian prince from Syria. No small
wonder then that Pliny, a noted ancient scholar, says of the Druids in
his work &quot;Natural History&quot; that the Druids practiced Magick with such
elaborate ritual that it would almost appear that it was they &quot;who had
3231

taught the Persians&quot;. These are none other than the Magi or &quot;wise men&quot;
from whom the word Magick is derived. Another ancient historian, Dio
Chrysostum groups the Druids together with the Persian, Hindu and
Egyptian priesthoods regarding their use of magical powers. While I'm
connecting Magical schools, I may as well say that Liber Al vel Legis
(The Book of the Law) is the channeled revelation of the Egyptian
dieties Nuit, Hadit and Ra-Hoor-Khuit (Otherwise known as Isis, Osiris
and Horus) Horus is two in one, Horus and Harpocrates or Set/Apophis).
We have already seen the use of these three godnames in the &quot;Rite of
Three Rays&quot; from a previous workshop. This was the intonation of the
sounds &quot;IAO&quot; used when invokiing the One Power. In Thelemic Magick the
Book of the Law is the basis for the revelation of a &quot;New Aeon&quot; or &quot;New
Age&quot;. It was channeled in 1904 by Aleister Crowley 90 years ago this
month. &quot;Do what thou wilt is the whole of the Law&quot;. &quot;Love is the Law,
Love under Will&quot;. (caps are mine).

I have digressed quite a bit here but I think the time is well spent.
Celtic Magick is tied through the Druids to the Egyptians and the
Persians to a far older Magick arising out of Summeria and from there
beyond time. It is true and powerful Magick and I give the same caution
to you that I gave about herbs last workshop....think long and hard and
with great deliberation before undertaking this journey. Once the path
is taken, the journey must be completed.

Now I finally get to my first topic of the night!  &lt;G&gt;:

            &quot;How to actually influence your surroundings&quot; 
    
The key to any act influencing the world around us is to be in tune and
in touch with it first. You must hear the tune before you can change the
music or even write your own song. I suggest a lot of meditation in
Nature. Find a spot that &quot;speaks&quot; to the Pagan within you. Be at Peace
and &quot;feel&quot; the pulse of Nature, the God and the Goddess. Once this
rapport has been established, one is ready to influence the surround-
ings. The Druids left us few writings concerning their spells and
Magicks.  We must &quot;rediscover&quot; these Works by looking at the Magicks
that are done in the world today and by Using our &quot;Druid filters&quot; and
&quot;Celtometers&quot;!! &lt;G&gt;  I have included examples of such &quot;Natural Magics&quot;
from my own experiences, the experiences of other Witches and Druids as
well as those that I found in the writings of Doreen Valiente, Bonewits
and Scott Cunningham.

                   &quot;How to perform Weather Magick&quot; 

For weather Magickal examples I turned to our very own Thunder Being,
Shadow Hawk, shaman and wizard extraordinaire!&lt;G&gt; He obliged me with a
few examples:

     The first example involves the  control of weather fronts and rain.
Our favorite shaman uses the techniques of dancing and drumming to
attain a higher state. He invokes the Lightning beings and they join the
dance with him. By being so in tune with them he can ask that they do
his bidding. If he must act upon an existing weather front, he sends his
&quot;power animal&quot;, Dragon into the clouds. Dragon is a manifestation of
this Shaman in the power planes. Dragon then interacts with the clouds
and controls the storms. When the work is done, he is recalled to his
shaman. The use of such a &quot;power animal&quot; or Magickal construct allows
the wise shaman to &quot;become&quot; one with the elements of the storm and 
3232

influence them without &quot;losing himself&quot; in their wild natures. The
connection is retained with the Self (Shadow Hawk) back upon the ground
while the power animal (Dragon) works among the clouds. The use of such
Power has its price.... Shadow Hawk suffers sever headaches for three
days following these episodes.

The second example of how our Dark Shaman uses the weather for Magick is
in charging his Magickal tools: his sword, wand and athame. During a 200
MPH hurricane, he faced the Power of the storm, shouting out the
invocation of the Quarters, forming a Magickal Circle and calling the
storms Power into his sword, his wand and his athame. He also captured
the storm's rain in a cauldron for later magickal workings. Can't you
see him with the storm's winds lashing at his cloak? Sword upraised as
lightnings crash all around him, exploding in sparks and reflecting in
eerie blue lights off the steel of his blade and the aura of his
Magick!!! He has used these tools in many Powerful workings.

                     &quot;How to call animals to you&quot; 

This is a matter of &quot;becoming&quot; the animal in your mind and &quot;willing&quot; it
to come to you.  Actually the &quot;Beastmaster&quot; movie illustrated this
technique quite well. Most good hunters do this subconsciously and
naturally.
           
                     &quot;How to improve your crops&quot;  
          
In this Working, invoke no other spirits than your own. Burn no fires
nor incenses. Carry four stones with you that have been blessed by you
in a previous ceremony. Set these stones to define the area that is to
be planted. Cast a Magickal Circle within this field. Sit upon the
ground and place both hands upon the earth at your sides. Feel the
earth, it's dampness, its fertility, its calm. Reflect upon your needs
and the crops you are about to plant.  Next recite a suitable chant or
poem. I like this one: 

                               &quot;Go maith raibh agat, na mBande'.
                                Go maith raibh agat, na De'.
                                Go maith raibh agat, talamh me'ith.

                                Cuirim fad beannacht na greine thu.
                                Cuirim fad beannacht na gealai thu.
                                Cuirim fad beannacht mo chroi' thu.
        
                                Go me'adai Bhri'de do sto'r san 
                                         ba'isteach de earrach.
                                Go me'adai Danu do sto'r san 
                                        greine te de tsaamhradh.
                                Go me'adai Dagdha do sto'r 
                                       san gaoth ple'isiu'rtha fo'mhar.&quot;

As I sit and reflect upon the bounty that the Land has given me I give
back to the earth of my own personal Power. I remember the blessings it
has bestowed to me and my pleasure in its well being.  After a suitable
amount of reflection and meditation, I arise to do my plowing and to
plant my seeds for another turn of the Wheel.
      
               &quot;How to influence the outcome of events&quot; 

3233

I try to create a feeling of Positive Magick within me. I banish all
negative thoughts. I surround myself with a glow of positive golden
energy. I tap the flows of the earth and the sky and &quot;project&quot; a
creative field all around me. I find that this works well in casinos and
just before having important meetings. It helps to strongly visualize
the outcome that is desired and to see the results occur and not the
actions that cause them. Let events sort themselves as they may. Let the
Magick work. Be patient and await the rewards.
 
                   &quot;How to discover your past life&quot;

Some people use tapes and hypnosis to do past life regressions. Perhaps
some of you have and can share those experiences with us tonight. I find
that what works best for me is to read about a time to understand the
events of that period and to set the stage for my Work. I then allow
myself to &quot;daydream&quot; and reflect about that time and to see myself
within it. What usually happens next is that no revelation comes to me
immediately. I maintain my focus over perhaps as long as three days
constantly checking to see if my &quot;dream&quot; search has produced any
results. When I least expect it, sudden revelation will show me a scene
from a past life and my part in it. It's like seeing a photograph from
an album for me.
      
              &quot;How to find your Inner Teacher or Self&quot;  
      
This is the start of all real Magick, finding your True Will. Many
techniques exist for doing this in a variety of books, everything from
&quot;the 21 Lessons&quot; to Donald Michael Kraig's &quot;Modern Magic&quot;. I will relate
how it happened to me. I studied the works of Magick, Science and
Religions (as many as I could find). I sought for the Truth that was
external to me.  I was a bulldog chasing down many paths and wrestling
with many concepts. The Truth eluded me, always constantly out of mu
grasp....the fox and the grapes. I was incredibly frustrated.  One night
I gave it all up. As I lay in the Silence of my mind, I left all of the
mundane world behind and suddenly I was surrounded by Spirit in a place
not a place. It was not within me...I had ceased to exist I was the
student and the Spirit was the teacher. Since then, if I have need of an
answer, I create a sacred space for me to be silent and I await
enlightenment. I listen to my Inner Guide.  Sometimes the lessons are
easy and othertimes I have to learn the hard way. (Frequently I get off
of My Path and am &quot;guided back&quot; with many &quot;object&quot; lessons kicking me in
the seat of the pants&lt;G&gt;)! I would be interested in hearing how anyone
else found their True Will.  Mine search was long and hard and I still
stray in confusion at times!&lt;G&gt;

                       &quot;How to summon 'Spirits'&quot;

I will give an example of how to summon the Spirit of Merlin as found in
the book &quot;The 21 Lessons of Merlin&quot; by Douglas Monroe. Before we begin
there is a chant we must learn in old Welsh:

                                &quot;Bedd Ann ap lleian ymnewais fynydd
                                      lluagor llew Ymrais
                                 Prif ddewin Merddin Embrais.&quot;

         the meaning:

                               &quot;The grave of the nun's son on 
3234

                                Newais Mountain:
                                        Lord of Battle, Llew Embrais, 
                                        Chief Magician, Myrddin Emrys.&quot;

        the pronunciation:

                                &quot;BETH AHN ahp T-Lay'in, eem-NEW-ais
                                 FEEN-ith
                                    T-loo-AH-gor T-loo EEM-rais
                                 Preeve DEW-in MEER-thin EHM-rihs.&quot;

I find that using an unusual language in a chant helps me to free myself
from the chains of the mundane and allows me to focus upon the Working. 
After memorizing the above chant one must search for a suitable
site....a grave yard or burial ground that is isolated from prying eyes
and situated upon a hill. This sounds hard but is not impossible to do.
I know of such a place where my great, great grandfather and grandmother
are buried upon a hill beneath a copse of trees in a farmers fields.
Many such spots exist... though work can find them (and hopefully also
permission to use them). 

Pick a suitable night for the ritual, Samhain being the absolute best
night. Gather nine pumpkins that are carved with faces (though candle
holders will do...just not as spooky).  Set the circle up the day before
the ritual as you don't want any distractions from your Work. Arrange
the pumpkins with candles around you in a circle (about arms width) with
the faces looking outward. Always light the candles from within the
circle. Pick a suitably soulful dirge (for meditation and mood setting) 
from your favorite songbook (Monroe suggests his but you know what you
like better). Sing this song as you meditate and reflect upon the
Working. Place an iron cauldron within the circle upon a bed of coals.
Into this cauldron place a mixture of an herb, a flower and a tree
(Monroe suggests using 1 part wormwood, 2 parts Ghostflower (Datura) and
3 parts Yew (juniper or cypress) as an incense mixture. (Store bought
incenses work just as well and can be burned in an incense burner
instead of a cauldron). Start the entire ritual at 30 minutes before
Midnight.  At precisely Midnight throw additional incense on the coals
and recite the above invocation nine times without stopping. &quot;Become&quot;
one with the chant! See into the Darkness! Expect the coming of Myrddin
Emrys! Sit quietly and await the coming of the shade of Merlin! You may
ask for the answers to three questions. Release the shade by extinguish-
ing the fire and incense completely, then extinguish the 9 circling
fires of the pumpkin heads. You can  now pack up and leave. The key to
successfully working this Magick is setting the mood, performing the
meditations and reflections and reciting the invocation properly. The
ritual can be adapted to allow you to invoke other Spirits as well to
equal effect.

The ancient Gaels would do similar rituals to communicate with the dead.
They would usually lay  and sleep upon the grave of the person to be
summoned while fasting, until the shade appeared. This process was not 
 lightly undertaken by them, as the dead could be quite dangerous to the
living, wanting to regain the pleasures of the flesh (hence the need for
the Magickal Circle of pumpkins and light). In a previous workshop I
told how the Ta'in Bo' Cuailnge was recovered by a young Druid sleeping
upon the grave of Feargus Mac Rioch. I'd like to caution you all once
more to do these rituals only when in dire need.  That's why it's
important to do two things...
3235

                        1. Always work within a Circle.
                        2. Have someone there that can aid you if things 
                          get out of hand. This means severingthe      
                         connection and banishing the entity.
This is also why it's so important to know your True Will. When you have
that anchor you can come back from anywhere. I know... because I have
done it. It's like climbing a hill though...

(2-28,cherokee)         Rhianna, I think as od said it's important to
remember that you are working with very powerful energies. You must be
pure and centered before doing the work. The indians believe it is not
possible for an animal to take over a human because the animals are here
as guides who keep us close to our source.


Celtic Workshop #11 - &quot;Walking between the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Journeys on the
Wheel&quot;
        
We met on Tuesday evening because the online Bealtaine Ritual was on
Monday. The topics of discussion were Out of Body Experiences (OOBE),
Astral Travel and Inner Journeys. An example of a &quot;pathworking&quot; on
Fionn's Wheel was given.

Tonight's workshop discusses Astral Travel and Inner Journeying.
Tonight's topics are:
 
                                Out of Body Experiences
 
                                Astral Travel
 
                                Example Inner Journey on Fionn's Wheel
 
Tonight we talk briefly about the subject of Out of Body Experiences
(OOBE). Thisexperience is the means by which one can effect or achieve
Magick. It is central to the methods behind the Magickal Law: &quot;As Above,
So Below&quot;. A complete workshop will be offered here soon by another, so
I touch briefly on these techniques tonight.

Three excellent books on these subjects are:
        
                                Astral Projection by Denning and
                                Phillips.
 
                                Journeys Out of the Body by
                                Robert A. Monroe.
 
                                Traveling With Power by Ken
                                Eagle Feather.
 
I will present the results of an Inner Journey later, using Fionn's
Wheel as a guide to the Astral Archtypes within each of us.
 
The basic techniques of OOBE are these: &quot;disassociation&quot; and &quot;release&quot;. 
Another word for &quot;disassociation&quot; is &quot;meditating&quot;.  Meditating allows us
to break free from the conditioning forced upon our thoughts by the ever
so mundane, so-called &quot;normal&quot; world. It places our mind into a rhythm
that allows it to &quot;vibrate&quot; in resonance to other realities (some might
say other dimensions or even other worlds). I achieve this state by 
3236

going through a process of literally forcing myself to &quot;relax&quot;. I relax
my extremities first, then my legs, arms, trunk, head, breathing, heart
and lastly, my mind. The body is calmed by physically lifting, then
releasing a body part and &quot;feeling&quot; the waves of relaxation flow inward
and up the body. This is done in succession until only the mind is
active. 
 
Once totally within the mind, relaxation of thought must occur. I
achieve mental quietness by visualizing a totally &quot;Black&quot; void into
which all thoughts, feelings and flickers of thoughts and feelings are
fed.  This process continues until all is &quot;black&quot;.  I float before a sea
of Darkness. I see nothing, I feel nothing , I am nothing. Once this
state is achieved, one may proceed to &quot;travel&quot; or have an OOBE.
 
 
                          &quot;Leaving the Body&quot;
 
To leave the body requires an additional two steps: an increase in the
vibratory rate of the Spirit and a &quot;pushing&quot; out of the body. I am lucky
that I seem to have discovered these techniques while experimenting on
my own. The proper level of Spiritual vibration or &quot;ecstasy&quot; is achieved
by further relaxation and through belief or &quot;Will&quot;. I totally believe
that my Spirit can leave my body and do anything. This focused and
concentrated belief through Will is the essense of all Magick. It is
absolutely necessary to achieve results. Some might call this process
&quot;faith&quot;. It is the stuffby which mountains are moved and with which
entire worlds and even universes are created.  It is also the basis of
Love and it is through Love that most of us discover the Power that we
all have to create and perform Magick.
 
Everyone from Ahura Mazda to Jesus to Crowley says the same thing about
this process. Love is Power. It is the fundamental requirement for
creative Work. Let us soar upon the wings of eagles and fly on the wings
of doves into the Astral.  I &quot;key&quot; the process of leaving my body to
seeing in every direction at the same time. This is impossible for me to
visualize or to consider in my &quot;normal&quot; existence while contained within
the physical shell of my skull and the confines of my body.  
 
The &quot;Darkness&quot; I have achieved by relaxation of the mind is seen as a
balloon. I see only one side of it. As my Magick squeezes this balloon,
it expands toward me and through me until I am surrounded by the
Darkness. While this process of transformation and metamorphesis occurs,
I maintain constant contact with all aspects of the Darkness that I
encounter when the passage is complete, I see the inside and the outside
of the Dark Bubble.  I see in two directions! This is one step. I take
as many steps as are necessary, piling belief upon work and work upon
belief until no direction is unseen. I see myself from without and
myself from within. I float and I create.  I &quot;travel&quot; and I do anything
I can conceive.  My existence is a &quot;waking dream&quot;. I am the master of
Reality. I am a new creation! This is the essence of OOBE. Where one
goes from here is for a more advanced workshop. I trust the New Age
forum OOBE Workshop will be just such an experience for all of us. I
plan to be a part of it and I trust you will all join me there.
 
               &quot;A Journey Through the Veil at Bealtaine&quot;
 
In the spirit of this Bealtaine season and to Honor the Mother of Summer
and the Lord of the Greenwood, I took out a copy of Fionn's Wheel to use
3237

as a focus for my reflections and musings. I found a quiet spot with no
distractions and I gazed upon the Magickal Oghams of the Wheel. I sought
guidance about the world around us and clarity as to my purpose. As I
gazed upon the symbols, a mist began to form and I slowly began to
journey. The veil between the worlds is thinnest on the spindle of the
Wheel this night. What follows is the story of my journey upon the
pathways of the Wheel:  (A voice within my mind spoke to me.)
 
&quot;Tonight is a night of Magick. Come with me into the rath ..enter the
home of the Sidhe. Let us walk the moonways and take the path of the
journey within:&quot; 
 
                        &quot;The Mists of Draiocht&quot;
 
&lt;The mists arise in the meadow and gather in whorls and spirals. The air
is filled with mystery. A strange call sounds...
                        can you hear it?...shivers and silvers..
                        bells?... or ... harp strings and laughter?
                        We are called...called are we....called...
                        we must go....we must go...we must go...
                        Wrapped in wraiths of shimmering silver..
                        flowing, ever flowing from without..
                        time is not here...reality dissolves...
                        consciousness journeys within.
                        Into the night i must go...on spirit wings,
                        leaving this world behind!! I must go!
                        Billowing fog and music calls to me!
                        I have no legs...the mist rises! ...
                        I ride the waves...no arms..none! The
                        Power flows within always within.....
                        within...always......always..........
                        within......I float I float I float..
                        Only me in the silence and the drums...
                        Only me...the spirit me survives!
                        And my heart lives on in echoes! It 
                        calls to me across the void as I journey. 
                        Hear the beat of my heart's drum...hear
                        the beat of life's blood...my thoughts
                        are a rhythm...a drumming, a rhythm of
                        life and thought across the shimmering
                        moonways....come within .....within..
                        Feel the energy in waves as it comes 
                        ...in waves and we float..we float as
                        the waves...the waves...the waves...
                        come to us ..... we are...not 
                        we are not...we are not..we are not! Not!
                        It comes!! The darkness comes!
                        Darkness.

                        &quot;The Point of Light&quot;
 
                        One point of light...one point of life!!
                        Only that ...only that...and the drum...
                        the drum as we journey...mists of silver...
                        we are mist and we float to the light..
                        the Silver wheel turns on mists of...
                        mists of...silver and light...a moth...
                        drawn...the light beckons..to the wheel...
3238

                        swirling in light and darkness....how
                        can this be? Where can we be? How?
                        How?  The Wheel turns and we turn as
                        we spiral....spirals of life within...
                        within....no drumming...the silence is
                        all...Nothing and ALL!! We are!!
 
                        Nothing.
 
                        The journey begins:
 
                        &quot;The Hallway of Music&quot;
 
                        (Who is it that speaks?)
 
                        &quot;Come to me my children...come within!
                        It is time... your time..our time...all
                        of time...and no time...We are here!
                        We are! We rejoice!
 
                        Rejoice!!&quot;
 
                        &quot;Let us laugh and play the old songs!!
                        Let us sing and discover!! Dance the
                        dance and travel!&quot;
 
                        &lt;Arms surround me and sweep me across
                        a floor that was not there a moment
                        ago. Laughter fills the air. I am happy.
                        I smile with lips I do not have. I am
                        me but I am theirs as well!&gt;
 
                        (How can this be?)
 
                        The colors are every color!! Multicolored
                        hues and rays abound!! They are many and
                        they are one !!! They are one and they are 
                        many! The colors! The colors are all one!
                        The signs of mystery...abound...the Mystery 
                        is in the signs ... The signs of Mystery!
                        All is Pefect ...all is Beauty...and...
                        I choose the first sign. ....&quot;Huath&quot;
 
                        &lt;The flames engulf me!! I burn and I
                        am gone!! Into the Dark!! and the Light
                        beckons...Death and Life!! ....Love and
                        Sex!! I am steel!! I am a sword!!!
                        Goibhnui hammers upon his forge!!  I was
                        steel and now I am a sword!! I am a tool!!

                        and Death .... endlessly ...  endlessly ...
                        until the Beginning. I must be shaped and
                        molded. I must burn the impurities! I must
                        sacrifice them to the Holy Fires! Purity!
                        Into the Twin Fires!!! Flames of Purity!!&gt;

                        Deep Waters! Holy Waters! Healing Waters!
                        Awash in cooling , soothing waters 
                        of forgetting and solitude...I am not here.
                        I am a wave upon a sea of stillness....
                        I am the reflection of the moon in
                        pathways of silver!! I am an endless sea.
                        A sea that flows around a Great Tree....
                        A Shining Tree of Light! A Tree within 
                        the Light...a Tree that has been and
                        is always. It is the way!! It is a doorway!
                        A doorway to purpose!! A purpose that endures!! 
                        Enduring for all time!! A White Tree of many 
                        branches...many branches of life! Each branch a 
                        gathering of silver ... silver leaves in the 
                        moonlight. Moonlight and songs of Magick!
                        The music begins!!! The music of the
                        leaves sing to me! Each note...a lifetime
                        of purpose...attempted and tried....
                        gained and lost....melodies of song...
                        life's song....the call of the wren... 
                        each small note builds with the others!!
                        a symphony of souls...a multitude.... 
                        all the same...It is I!! They are me!!

                        All of me....The sound gathers and the
                        music swells!! It is the call!! The call
                        is made and we/I/us/they/I gather to BE!&gt;
 
                        The doorway is open yet the door itself 
                        is closed! Pass within with me:

                        a canvas of green...painted against
                        a sky filled with grey...green birds
                        all flocking together...as one bird...
                        a giant creature of the Air... and I 
                        soar through the beams and boughs of
                        the Holly King's Hall and into the Sky!&gt;

                        Join me upon the wings of Air:
 
                        &quot;The Flight of the Starling&quot;
 
                        A lush green earth spreads in fields
                        below me as I soar upon the winds.
                        I journey through and above a garden.
                        Many blooms...many flowers...many scents.
                        The air is filled with sounds and scent
                        and I see Forever across the World of 
                        the Living even unto the Hill in the
                        Center. The Center of all things. A great 
                        stone temple arises within a grove of hazel
                        and is framed against a golden light. White
                        and grey stones surround a crystal well
                        that sparkles within the mote of the always 
                        seeing eye! The Crystal Light shines forth!
                        It guides me to the spring!! The Waters
                        of Life!! The Wellspring of Knowledge!!
                        Crystal twinkles of light play music upon 
                        my mind's eye and cascade in fountains of joy!
                        The Song of the Ages of Man and Woman ....
                        so Many and so Right...the temple is filled
                        by the Song and the Dance ...step and sing!
                        Brothers and Sisters! Are we all here? What
                        is this place? Am I here? Are you here?
                        We are within... I am AWARE.
 
                        &quot;The Fountain and the Field&quot;
 
                        &lt;I approach the fountain within the temple.
                        The roof is open to the sky and many birds
                        can be seen...yet only two are with me..
                        and they stand within the waters. One is the
                        white Crane from the Dead Sea.. I am speared
                        upon the point of his eye. I am pierced!!
                        I am lifted to a ledge of stone that surrounds

                        &lt;A small voice croons to me..the voice of the

                        querc and the Tree.&gt;

                        I ask,&quot;What is this Tree that grows within
                        this Sacred Place oh small brown one? What
                        is this Tree and why am I here? Guide me!
                        Let your Spirit show me the way!&quot;
 
                        &lt;The bird hops along a branch to where a
                        fruit of greens and pinks swells forth in 
                        its ripeness.&gt;

 
                        &quot;Take...eat...SEE...and know life!!!Here
                        are the five points of Eternity!!! Here
                        are the seeds of Life itself!! Eat only 
                        if you are wise! Live only if you are pure!
                        Endure only if you are strong and return
                        to choose wisely once again!! Now is the 
                        time of the Five Pointed Star!! You must
                        become a Star child and grow!!! Be a
                        Point of Light in the Darkness!! Be the
                        Darkness and the Light!&quot;
 
                        &lt;I reach up and take the fruit. I split
                        it into two halves...one more pink than
                        green ... the other more green than 
                        pink. Within are the star shaped seed
                        chambers of life. The Star is born!!!
                        I bite into the Quert, the fruit of Life!! 
                        I am BECOME!&gt;

                        The World Beckoned to me once more:
 
                        &quot;The Light in the Darkness&quot;
 

                        The point of light recedes rapidly into
3242

                        the night, a shooting star across the skies.
                        I am alone once more looking at the wheel,
                        wondering about myself...Who am I? What
                        does this mean? What awaits me? What awaits
                        us all?  We are alone and the Wheel turns.
 
                        Once more I gaze upon Fionn's wheel...
                        and know my journeys continue....It's
                        knowledge is my shield. I am a sword and
                        the fires of summer beckon to us all.
 
Such is the nature of an Inner Journey. I continue to see this journey
and to reflect upon its meanings to me and to who I am. I recommend that
each of you also undertake such journeys for yourselves. Go within to
your Inner Guide and travel the Wheel.  Journey the pathways of Fionn to
Wisdom and Knowledge. Beannacht libh!  That was my experience in an
Inner Journey.

Celtic Workshop #12 - The &quot;Outer Darkness&quot;, the &quot;Dragon's Eye&quot; and the 
&quot;Many Speckled Rainment&quot;

This Workshop was presented and hosted by Searles O'Dubhain. We covered
the basis of Druid Magick or Drai'ocht. We discussed the &quot;Dragon&quot; or
&quot;Serpent&quot; Power that is inherit in the Land. We touched on the many
different areas of knowledge and discipline necessary to be a Druid. We
also discussed the Mysteries of &quot;Death&quot; and &quot;Rebirth&quot;. Some preliminary
socializing soon gave way to the formal presentation and discussion:

Here is what I hope to cover tonight:
 
                             The Road to the Grove.
                             The Druidic concepts of Being. 
                             The use of the Power of the Land
                             in the Rite of the &quot;Dragon's Eye&quot;. 
                             The &quot;ley lines&quot; and the &quot;death roads&quot;. 
                             The attainment of Druidic enlightenment 
                             (Initiation to the Inner Mysteries) 
                             Authority and the &quot;Many Speckled Rainment&quot;
        
                        &quot;The Road to the Grove&quot;
 
There are many paths to Magick though only One True Magick IMHO. The
Grove is a home to this Power as is the Circle and the Temple. How do we
attain the Power to do Magick for ourselves and for all of humanity? Let
us look to see what the Pathways were for others.
 
                             &quot;The Ancient Druidic Orders&quot;
 
I have discussed the Ancient orders or levels of Druids in a previous
workshop.  I include them here for the sake of our current discussion. 
 
Druidic Bards studied for 15 to 20 years to learn the epics, chants,
spells and histories of their peoples and clans. These works were
memorized exactly and were a requirement for advancement to a higher or
inner level of the Druidic ranks. The works had to be rendered with
feeling so that the listener would be spell bound and consequently could
relive the event. The Irish Druids had the following classes of Bards:
 
                            Class          # of Epics
                         __________________________________________ 
                            Driseg         20   (the Beginner)
                            Foclaic        30   (Advanced beginner)
                            Cili           100  (Journeyman)
                            Anraid         175  (Master/Warrior)
                            Ollomh         175+ (Doctor/Judge)
 
It is to be expected that the lawyers, seers, scientists, judges, and
clergy of the Draoi underwent similarly lengthy training periods.
 
                      &quot;The Cloak of Many Colors&quot;
 
In the Christian Bible, Joseph was awarded a cloak of many colors by his
father because he was beloved among all of his brothers.  Due to the
jealousy and greed of his brothers, Joseph was also sold into slavery in
Egypt and suffered a &quot;death&quot; to his old way of life.  Because he was
open to wisdom and could perceive the meanings within signs and dreams,
3244

he became the chief counselor to the Pharaoh and rose above his death to
&quot;new life&quot;. Just as the history of the Gaels is tied to Egypt, so the
rites of Druids are tied to this idea of &quot;many colors&quot; and rebirth.
Please recall that the Mileseans descend from the Pharaohs  of Egypt and
that their Druids were said to be better Magi than the Persians. To be
as good a Druid as Joseph, one must learn the art of interpreting
dreams, divination and eloquence. This is a mighty job and worthy of us
all!
                        &quot;My Own Personal Paths&quot;
 
When I embarked upon the quest for my roots and for the nature of
Drai'ocht, I was immediately impressed by two things: 
 
                        1. The Druids were acute and patient observers
                        of Nature.
 
                        2. The Druids were the scholars and scientists
                        of their day.
 
Using these two ideas, I created a color-coded series of educational
levels for myself in my quest into the secrets of the Draoi.
 
I believe there are five areas of knowledge in the Mysteries: 
 
                                Knowledge of Self, 
                                Knowledge of the World,
                                Knowledge of the Spirit, 
                                Knowledge of Magick, 
                                Knowledge of the ONE.
 
The entire process of learning and growing never stops. As a minimum I
have required myself to know the following:
 
                        Knowledge of Self  (The Blue Level)
                        __________________________________________
The Student must be able to meditate until he/she can know their inner

         Knowledge of the World (The Green Level)
        __________________________________________
 
The Student must know the physical world.  The Student must know how the
laws of Nature work.  The Student must be Holistic with Creation.  The
Student must be able to shape the forces of Physics and Chemistry.  The

................................................................................
3245

            The Knowledge of the Spirit (The Yellow Level)
            ______________________________________________
 
The Student must know the Spirit within.  The Student must study the
Religions of Humanity.  The Student must make a Spiritual Journey.  The
Student must leave the body and walk the Moon Ways. (OOBE) The Student
must see the origins and travels of the Spirit within. (PAST LIFE
REGRESSION)  The Student must Know the Spirit in Music, Colors, Symbols
and Life.  The Student must hear the Akasha.
 
             The Knowledge of Magick (The Orange Level)
             __________________________________________
 
The Student must read the Great Works (Cayce, Crowley, Enoch, Fortune,
Hermes, Jung, Ogham, Pythagorus, Qabalah, Science, Solomon, Thelema,
etc.)  The Student must learn to &quot;See.&quot; The Student must learn to
&quot;Divine&quot;.  The Student must learn to &quot;Shield.&quot;  The student shall learn
to &quot;Speak.&quot;  The student shall learn to &quot;Heal.&quot;  The student shall learn
to &quot;Travel.&quot;  
 
              The Knowledge of the ONE (The Red Level)
             __________________________________________
 
The Student must create and lead a Ritual.  The Student must focus the
three Powers (Earth, Self, ONE).  The Student must perform the Great
Rite.  The Student must change Reality.  The Student must perform the
rite of &quot;Making.&quot;  The Student must be reborn and become ONE.
 
After passing through all levels successfully, the Student then becomes
the Teacher and can wear the  White, Multi-speckled or the Dark Robes of
their choice.  This is my path to Drai'ocht. You alone can choose the
proper path to your Inner Light of Whiteness or Darkness. All colors are
one color. All Drai'ocht is ONE DRAI'OCHT!
 
                  &quot;The Druidic concepts of Being&quot; 
                   ------------------------------- 
I would like to quickly touch on some Druidic concepts about states of
being. These states of being correspond to the previous cosmology that
we discussed in workshop 5. (Time does not permit me to make a complete
discussion of these topics tonight. I may add another workshop to cover
them more completely in the future.)
 
                &quot;Barddas and The Circles of Being&quot;
                ---------------------------------- 
The Welsh Bardic work &quot;Barddas&quot; contains a description of the three
Circles of Being: 
          1.  Abred or the Realm of Matter
              (The physical world of form)
 
          2.  Gwynyd or the Realm of Blessedness
              (The Magickal Astral world of Spirits)
 
           3.  Ceugant or the Realm of Infinities 
               (That which is the home of the
                God/desses and the Blessed)
 


3246

These states of being are separated by three veils that must be passed:
 
1.  Annwn or &quot;Dark Forgetfulness&quot;
    (This is the gap or veil that must be passed to achieve birth and
     rebirth in the Physical World.)
 
2.  Cythraul or &quot;the Ghost&quot;
    (This is the veil that must be passed to achieve enlightenment.)
 
3.  Lyonesse or &quot;the Isle of the Blest&quot;
     (This is the final veil that is passed when one has achieved
complete enlightenment and complete growth.)
 
&quot;Awen&quot; or &quot;illumination&quot; is like a lightning bolt that can come to us
across these veils and bring us knowledge and understanding.
 
The key to our Power and true wills is how well we are able to pass
between these states of being. I will discuss some of these techniques
next.
 
         &quot;Circles of Thought&quot; or, &quot;The Cyclatron of the Soul&quot;
        
One of the marvels of modern science is the atom smasher or particle
accelerator.  Another name for these powerful devices is a &quot;cyclatron&quot;.
This is basically a phased arrray of electromagnetic devices that take
charged particles and accelerate them to tremendous speeds around a
circular field until they approximate the speed of light or at least
they approach relativistic velocities. The particles are then smashed
into a target and the history of the mutual destruction is observed and
recorded so that humanity may unlock the secrets of the Gods. I trust
that most of us here tonight have experienced this acceleration effect
within the vortex of our thoughts and Spirits. We strive mightily to
increase the relativistic mass of our thoughts so that we may observe
their behavor as they approach God-like reality in their manifestions.
Whirr and strive as we might, we are doomed to the universal restraints
of our own humanity in much the same manner as nuclear physicists are
limited by the unvirsal limits of &quot;C&quot; or light speeds (warp Factor 1,
Mr. Sulu!&lt;G&gt;). Such are the limits of thinking.
 
               &quot;The Salmon Leap and the Shaman's Death&quot;
        
I have gone through the process of questing for ultimate meaning in life
many times. Most of this effort has been exhausting as well as futile.
Only through extraordinary efforts have I actually attained results.
These results came about through quantum leaps of the mind and spirit
across the &quot;void&quot;. Since the salmon is the totem of knowledge, I call
this leap the &quot;Salmon Leap&quot;. It is very approprite to name it thus since
the &quot;void&quot; is actually &quot;death&quot; and the salmon &quot;leap&quot; up the streams of
it's birth to spawn new life from it's own death struggle. The ancients
also refered to mighty feats as a &quot;Salmon Leap&quot;. We must experience the
&quot;Shaman's Death&quot; in order to attain our new life and knowledge. The
&quot;Salmon Leap&quot; brings us to a New Reality and altered state of Being.
Included in the initiation rites to all of the Great Mystery Schools was
just such a rite of Death and Rebirth. Anyone care to reveal their
secrets now?&lt;G&gt; OTO'ers? GD'ers? Druids? Wiccans? AMORC?  Freemasons?
Templars? Illumatti? Assassins? Channellers? Others? The floor is now
open. Let's hear the words of Life and the words of Death. Josey Wales
faces Ten Bears in the moment of Truth. The gauge is cast...the 
3247

challenge is issued. The floor is open to all comers!
 
                            &quot;Enlightenment&quot;
 
Coming through the &quot;dark night of the soul&quot; or the &quot;Shaman's Death&quot;
purifies and releases us so that we can experience illumination and
enlightenment. Our &quot;darkness' and ignorance are burned away in the
flames of the Phoenix as we are reborn into the Light! Such a wonder!
The Akasha and all knowledge are there to be received! Our training and
our quest are rewarded. We are a new creation!
 
                          &quot;The Dragon's Eye&quot;
 
The &quot;Dragon's Eye&quot; is another word for Earth Magick or the Power
inherent to the Land that is at the root of the Celtic Soul. This is the
power of Excalibur or Caliborn, the sword of Arthur. It is the &quot;Dragon's
Breath&quot; that Merlin works with to create a Magickal Mist while using the
charm of &quot;Making&quot;. We have already seen the &quot;Eye of the Dragon&quot; in a
previous workshop ritual. I would like to now open the floor for a
further discussion by everyone here as to how we sense this Power in the
Land and particularly how we sense it at many sacred sites such as
&quot;Stone Circles&quot;, Raths, Menhirs, Hills, &quot;Ley Lines&quot;, &quot;Stonehenge&quot;,
&quot;Avebury&quot; or any other site of your experience. The floor is now open
for Magickal discussion!

Anyone else have a good story for how they've sensed the Power of the
Land? How it just is laying there waiting for the call?

(2-10,Freepowder)       Some time, when you can be alone for a while..
climb up into the moutains, my mountains are the Sierras get up high,
above treeline, and sit there, find a rock... where the wind blows all
the time and just sit. it may take a while maybe an hour, maybe a day...
but you will feel it.. strength more than power, but power just the same
coming up form the rocks... singing in the wind... when you have got it
right.. the animals will come you may not see them, the conys and the
birds but you will feel them too if you are lucky.  they will talk to
you not in words but in thoughts.  if you are ready your totem will make
itself known I have found that no great preparation is neccesary but for
an open heart and mind it happens for me everytime I go there which is
not nearly often enough oh! don't do this in a lightning storm &lt;G&gt;

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         Beautiful Freepowder! A hymn to the Mother!
We can all sing the song of the Health of the Earth!  She is beautiful
still in some places and will be again in others as we....and I do mean
we.... all get together to release the Power of the Dragon!  THAT has
been safeguarded for us by our ancient Shamans within the Earth. I sense
that the keys for this Work are soon to be given to us all once more.

(2-15,Nan)              Well, I can think of many times that I've felt
the Power of the Land but I'll offer just a simple recent example:
Last week I gave my ankle a nasty sprain, I knew that one thing it
needed for healing was to walk barefoot on the land, so that's what I
did &lt;g&gt; in general I find that going barefoot on almost any ground
allows me to feel the power of the land......I don't do it long in the
snow though &lt;g&gt;.

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         I'll bet!!!&lt;G&gt;  Many of the ancient sacred sites
are no longer in active use. I think that the day is rapidly approaching
3248

where the Land will call us to Work Magicks at such sites. We will
re-establish the &quot;ley lines&quot; of Power that are now just echoes of their
past. These lines and sites require a Human/Dragon magickal connection
to re-Power the grids that exist all across this planet. Many events 
occur today that point to this Work.

(2-15,Nan)              I just wanted to comment that a few years ago I
visited a more obscure stone circle and noticed by items left behind
that it had been recently used..... so not *all* the ancient sites are
inactive and I'm glad!

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         That's true! I believe Shadow Hawk told about
feeling serpent lines of Power beneath Avebury's Circles during a visit
there as well, though Stonehenge seemed inert. He told me recently that
he sensed that it could come &quot;alive&quot; again for the right combination of
persons working there. If that happened, it would have to be tended on
a regular basis. Too much of the Dragon sleeps at that site.  Myrdin
Emyrs sleeps nearby himself!  Anyone else have a &quot;Dragon&quot; sense?

(2-17,cherokee/wwc1)    Many of the american indians have the same
legends only we call it the serpent my great grandmother taught me to go
out at night and to feel  the serpent move beneath my feet and to listen
to the song it made in the wind.  We believe the time for the serpent to
rise is here [it is in the] spirit of the people and the land.  I have
been a healer in my past lives we used the crystals to awaken the
serpent when it was time.  That time is soon and I feel the serpent
singing to me.

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         Thank you My Princess!&lt;G&gt;  Some legends say that
crystals were used at Stonehenge as well. They were placed upon the tops
of the lentils there to provide a Power connection.  Perhaps the crystal
skulls will provide an answer.  I hope to see one in Miami next month.

(2-15,Nan)              All this talk of serpents reminded me of
Australia, where the Aborigines have the story of the rainbow serpent (I
think it may be part of a creation myth) there they call the ley lines
songlines. Bruce Chatwin wrote a wonderful book by that name that covers
a lot about the Aborginal beliefs

(2-8,O'Dubhain)         I want to check into that some more. Isn't it
also amazing that everyone connects the serpent to wisdom ....even the
Christians do it!&lt;G&gt; Though I must say they try to make out like it was
a bad thing to get smart!&lt;G&gt;

(2-17,cherokee/wwc1)    All peoples have stories of serpents many of
them have head cult legends where the skulls were used as resonators to
focus energy and to sing to the serpent to wake it up the aborigines
believe this as did the mayans and the cherokees and other native

          &quot;The Many Speckled Rainment&quot; &quot;The Song of Amergin&quot;
        
This translation by Dr. Douglas Hyde from his work &quot;Literary History of
Ireland&quot; was as well known to the Druids as the &quot;Lord's Prayer&quot; is to
todays priests. It is a perfect example of the many different Magickal
skills used by the Druids. It is one of my personal favorites as
well!&lt;G&gt; I would like to use it to discuss the &quot;many-speckled&quot; rainbow
of Drai'ocht! Once again I give you the words of the Bard:
 
                                     The Mystery
 
                        I am the wind which breathes upon the sea.
                        I am the wave of the ocean.
                        I am the murmur of the billows.
                        I am the ox of the seven combats.
                        I am the vulture upon the
                        I am a beam of the Sun.
                        I am the fairest of plants.
                        I am a wild boar in valour.
                        I am a salmon in the water.
                        I am a lake in the plain.
                        I am a word of science.
                        I am a point of the lance in battle.
                        I am the God who created in the head the fire.
                        Who is it who throws light into the meeting 
                        on the mountain?
                        Who announces the ages of the Moon?
                        Who teaches the place where couches the Sun?
                                                        (If not I)&quot;
 
Let's just go down the line and list the Druidic attributes used in this
one spell by lines and in order (I also assigned colors to each
attribute):

I could write an entire page on each of these attributes but not
tonight!&lt;G&gt; &quot;Fire in the Head&quot; is the name of an excellent book by Tom
Cowan on the subject of Celtic Shamanism.  &quot;The 21 Lessons of Merlin&quot; by
Douglas Monroe agrees with my assignments for most of the above colors. 
A true Druid worn the Cloak of many Colors for festive occassions, White
or Black robes to conduct Magick and during ritual and a bull's hide
when in battle.
 
                              &quot;Authority&quot;
 
This the source or result of working with Magick for Druids. It is a
measure of their Power and the strength of their &quot;True Wills&quot;.  In the
&quot;21 Lessons&quot; Monroe states that the students of Drai'ocht were awarded
colored glass beads (called Gleini na Droedh) that were strung on
leather cords for necklaces. These multicolored necklaces were kept
secret by each Druid and produced only to demonstrate their Authority to
other Druids. Magick knowledge, discipline and practice determined the
level of Authority thus attained.
 
                           &quot;Into the Light&quot;
        
Fionn's Wheel can also be multicolored.  I have made the one in the
library that way!&lt;G&gt; (Make it so Number One!&lt;G&gt;) Seriously, to become a
Master Druid, one must transcend the separation of colors and walk into
the Light. This involves knowing the many fold paths of the Wheel and
primarily the Inner Mystery of the relationship of Life and Death, White
and Black, Balance and Action, Being and Not being. The Initiations into
most of the Great Mysteries included this Dualism of Transcendancy. (An
excellent  book on this topic is &quot;The Great Initiates&quot;by Edouard Schure,
translation by Gloria Rasberry.)
 
                        What does this mean? 
                        What is this Initiation?
                        What is the Mystery?
 
 
What follows is what I envision COULD have happened during such an
initiation.  Hear the words a modern day Druid  might hear as he
achieves his full Knowledge:
 
&lt;the Initiate will have been fasting and meditating within the total
darkness of a cave or a dark room for at least a night.  Just before the
rising of the sun or the lighting of the fires he/she would hear a loud
female voice cry out!&gt;
 
     &quot;I am Arianrhod, Queen of the Heavens!  You who approach me must
     now ask yourselves these questions: 
               How can you achieve the Inner Knowledge? 
          Where can you find the Signs that show you the Way? 
          Heed My Words! 
          I am Arianrhod, Queen of the Stars, 
          I am She of the Silver Wheel! 
          My crown spreads across the Vault of the Heavens! 
          Your dreams shall be filled with the Secret Ways of the Night! 
         It is I that will show you the Paths of Knowledge! 
          It is I that will fire your Spirit in sparkling crystals of
               Wonder! 
          I am Arianrhod! Come to Me My children!  
3251

          Be filled with Expectancy for what is yet to come!&quot;
 
&lt;The chief Druid could follow these words with the following caution.&gt;
 
          &quot;Hear the Words of the Ard Druis:&quot;
          &quot;You who seek the Ways of Power must dare to approach the
               Queen of the Stars! 
          You who seek the embrace of Wisdom must approach Her Presence
               without fear! 
          You that seek for Love must first know your True Selves. What 
         is your Authority?
          Are you truly Human? Speak now if you dare!&quot;
 
&lt;Then the Initiates should ask for entry to the Inner Mysteries.&gt;
 
                        &quot;Oh Arianrhod of the Silver Wheel! 
                        Bless us in Your Mysteries! 
                        Fill us with Your Spirit! 
                        Let us place no limits upon Your exalted Being! 
                        You are Infinite! 
                        You are the Unknown! The Darkness!
                        Admit us into Thy arms!
                        Grant us Your Blessings!
                        Our speech is confounded! 
                        Chaos is upon us!&quot;
 
&lt;Once again, the Ard Druis would charge the Initiates.&gt;
 
                        &quot;Now is the Great Re-awakening! 
                        Now is the time of enlightenment! 
                        Those who are untrue shall be cast out 
                        into the depths! 
                        Cleanse yourselves through trials of fire 
                        and fasting! The way is long, 
                        Only the strong shall attain Knowledge!&quot;
 
&lt;A flame or beam of sunlight should be produced to shine upon an open
doorway, admitting the Initiates into the Inner Sanctum.&gt;
 
                        &quot;Behold the Flaming Door!
                        Behold the Burning sword of Gorias!
                        Enter if you dare the halls of Lugh!!
                        Wear the many speckled cloak of Samildanach!&quot;
                        &quot;Hear the words of the Sun!&quot;
 
&lt;A male Druid dressed in Robes of Gold and bearing a torch should
address the Initiates.&gt;
 
     &quot;I am Lugh Lamfadagh!!! I am Samildanach!
     I am thy burning desire for Knowledge! 
     I am the Power that illumes the Heavens! 
     Life is my gift to you, even as your Death is the Mother of Life. 
     To know Me is to know yourself completely, even beyond Death!
     Enter if you dare!
     Approach the fires of Life!!!
     Die and live again!&quot;
 
     &quot;I, Lugh am the focus of the Power and you My Druid are its     
3252

Manifestation!
     Enter the Flaming Door!
          Cead Mile Failte! 
          Maith an Drui!&quot; 
 
&lt;At this point the Initiate should be robed in the multispeckled robe
and presented with a golden sickle and a staff fashioned from the wood
of the tree that is his &quot;soul tone&quot;.  Standing before the gathered
assembly,He should recite his geneology and the many achievements of his
necklace of Gleini na Droedh. The ceremony should then be completed by
the conducting of the Initiate's personal ritual (from his work on the
Red Level).&gt;
 
                        Such is the end of a long journey.
                        An Fhi'rinne Roimh an Saol!
                        We must awaken the Dragon Power within us all!!
                        DRAI'OCHT LIVES AGAIN!
                        TA' ME' DRAI'OCHT!!

Celtic Workshop #13 - The &quot;Charm of Making&quot; 

This Workshop was presented and hosted by Searles O'Dubhain. We covered
some concepts touching upon the beginings of all things. We also covered
how symbols are used to describe reality and Magick. We discussed the
necessity for *belief* in performing Magick. I led a discussion about a
ritual that was centered around the Charm of &quot;Making&quot;. The arch[e]types
and the Quarters used in Celtic Magickal systems were also discussed.
Some preliminary socializing soon gave way to the formal presentation
and discussion:

                            Opening Remarks
 
Tonight I attempt to tie together the beliefs of the Celts in Cos-
mologies and Magick or Drai'ocht to what we know of the world and
reality through the study of modern science and more recent Magickal
systems and their resulting Cosmological models. It is my hope that all
of this discussion will clarify the history of the Celts and the
workings of the Druids. The highest form of Drai'ocht was the Charm of
&quot;Making&quot;. This is the essence of creation by the use of the Will.  It is
into the Cauldron of Primodial Creation that I plunge tonight as a
Midwife to Magick.  Drai'ocht shall live again! The Dragon will once
again be reborn!
 
                                &quot;Chaos&quot;
 
In many mythologies and some philosophies, Chaos is the void that
existed in the begining of all things before even time existed and from 
which all things have arisen. 
 
&quot;The notion that creation came from nothing (creatio ex nihilo) appears
in several accounts of creation. The biblical story of creation
contained in the Book of GENESIS begins with a formless, watery chaos
that God shapes into the ordered world. The hymn of creation from
India's epic Rig Veda (see VEDAS) describes the primordial situation as
one of neither existence nor nonexistence and further states that no
one, not even the gods, knows who produced the universe. In marked
contrast is an Egyptian myth attributing creation to the deity khepri.
In this myth Khepri states that when he came into being, being itself
3253

came into being; all other beings were then produced from his actions
and his body; but before him there was only nonbeing. Among the
Polynesians, creation myths emphasize the dimensions of void space and
the qualities of darkness as the primordial structures of creation. In
these myths, the initial state of darkness and void in which the deity
dwells is later transformed and the forms of the universe then emerge.
Creation is thus predicated on a void or a nothingness--a reality
totally different from any form or substance of the created order. In
addition, the deities who create from nothing or emerge from this void
are given a new and special kind of power; for though creators of the
world, they remain distinct from it in their originative form.&quot;
.......quoted from The Online Edition of GROLIER'S ACADEMIC AMERICAN
Encyclopedia, Copyright (c) 1993, Grolier Electronic Publishing.
 
Magick is the ability to cross the void of Chaos and to create order in
the universe that surrounds us. The primary way in which this creation
occurs is through the focus of our own Wills.
 
                      &quot;The Void was without Form&quot;
        
&quot;Chaos theory, a modern development in mathematics and science, provides
a framework for understanding irregular or erratic fluctuations in
nature. Chaotic systems are found in many fields of science  and
engineering. The study of their dynamics is an essential part of the
burgeoning science of complexity--the effort to understand the prin-
ciples of order that underlie the patterns of all real systems, from
ecosystems to social systems to the universe as a whole.&quot; ..quoted from

The BIG BANG theory of the creation of the universe is widely accepted
by astronomers.  &quot;It holds that the universe began with the explosive
expansion of a single, extremely condensed state of matter. A further
development of this model, known as INFLATIONARY THEORY, describes the
original condensed matter as arising from virtually empty space. Whether
the universe will expand forever, slow to a halt, or contract again and
continue to oscillate indefinitely from one big bang to the next is the
subject of ongoing speculation.....&quot; Charles Long .......quoted from The

                                &quot;Order&quot;
 
Out of Nothingness was Reality formed. The diversity of Reality is due
to the two great forces of separation: projection and reception (the
male and the femine aspects of Power).  From this duality of all things,
the rest of Creation is manifested. This manifestation can be described
and modeled in many ways. I have chosen to limit myself briefly to two
such descriptions during tonight's workshop. The first such model or
description is the science of &quot;quantum mechanics&quot;. According to this
area of science, everything is composed of waves and the interaction
between wavefronts. With two primary and distinctly different sources of
waveforms, we get interference patterns. These lines of intersection
have their own &quot;nature&quot; and give rise to other &quot;quantum effects&quot; in
their own localized area of the space/time continuum. This ongoing
process of interaction and manifestation can create Infinite Combination
in Infinite Diversity (IDIC). I will discuss this concept later.
3254
 
The other way in which two differing states can create their own
&quot;reality&quot; is through the laws of Boolean Logic and Algebra. In digital
design and simulation techniques, this fact is well known. I work in
such areas and can reduce any system to a series of &quot;min&quot; and &quot;max&quot;
terms of inputs and &quot;truth tables&quot;. This Boolean discipline of using
&quot;min and max terms&quot; has given birth to the CyberSpace that we currently
inhabit. I suggest that our present existence is no more than a
&quot;real-time&quot; simulation in a greater system and that our creative/destru-
ctive interactions are constantly birthing new realities and new
creations. We are each a &quot;star&quot; as some Magickal systems teach. 
 
All Physical and Magickal systems have hidden controls that operate from
outside the program flow (another word for this flow might be called
&quot;life&quot;). This outside intervention might be what appears in the form of
&quot;Magick&quot; to an internal observer of that system. The operating system
for the host platform, such as DOS, determines the form of the relation-
ships between all programs, files and other processes. A magickal way of
stating this might be, &quot;As Above, So Below&quot;.  Tonight, I have discussed
only two ways that some realities are postulated and created. In the
wide variety of the Infinite Cosmos, Diversity is carried to the
extremes. Anything CAN and DOES happen!
 
                               &quot;Symbols&quot;
 
One way man has attempted to understand and quantify his universe is
through the use of symbols. The most often used symbols are numbers,
letters and sigils. The Jewish Kabbala, the Celtic Oghams and the other
Magickal alphabets are good examples of the use of such symbols to order
and understand most physical, spiritual and Magickal relationships. I
have talked about Oghams and Fionn's Wheel/Ladder in previous workshops.
I have also talked about the Celtic Cosmology. Tonight I will briefly
touch on numbers and math. Please refer to the previous Celtic Workshops
#1, 2, 3, 5 and the Online Wicca Kabbala Threads for more information in
those areas. Another kind of symbol that can describe our reality is a
relatively new form of mathematics called Fractals.
 
                              &quot;Fractals&quot;
 
&quot;A modern mathematical theory that radically departs from traditional
EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY, fractal geometry describes objects that are
self-similar, or scale symmetric.  This means that when such objects are
magnified, their parts are seen to bear an exact resemblance to the
whole, the likeness continuing with the parts of the parts and so on to
infinity.  Fractals, as these shapes are called, also must be devoid of
translational symmetry--that is, the smoothness associated with
Euclidean lines, planes, and spheres.  Instead a rough, jagged quality
is maintained at every scale at which an object can be examined.  The
nature of fractals is reflected in the word itself, coined by mathe-
matician Benoit B. Mandelbrot from the Latin verb frangere, &quot;to break,&quot; 
and the related adjective fractus, &quot;irregular and fragmented.&quot;
 
The science of fractals has been found to exist within many natural
formations . Fractals are found everywhere we look, from the shape of 
coastlines to the geometry found in cellular divisions. Most dynamical
systems that change their behavior over time become CHAOTIC in nature
and can also be described using fractals.  The reason I mention fractals
tonight is twofold. First, fractals show us mathematically how reality
and life are manifested. As I said earlier, fractal geometry and 
3255

mathematics are a fairly recent discovery. One important type of Fractal
that is found in nature is called a Mandelbrot set. This particular set
of fractals becomes inheritly unstable as one looks closer at it's
component fractals. What is so interesting about this fact and study is
that FRACTALS in the FORM OF MANDELBROT SETS have been appearing as CROP
CIRCLES on the Salisbury Plains. This is the same area that is located
close by both Stonehenge and Avebury.  What is the source of these
symbols? Where is this information coming from? Are these crop circles
some sort of Magickal alphabet or symbols? Are they communicated to us
across time and space from other Magicians or other Entities? If they
are such symbols, has this phenomena occurred before in the past? Did
the Druids observe, record and understand this type of information
during their times? 
 
My second pointis that our knowledge of Magick is itself like a fractal.
With each piece of information we receive from our searches into the
nature of Magick, we discover more and more questions. This gives rise
to more and more associations and consequently more questions and
disorder. Our attempts to totally understand Magick by close inspection 
consequently results in chaotic thinking.  We see fractals everywhere
when we look at the world. This world seems to be a fractal.  Everything
from shorelines, earthquakes, cell structure to computer graphics have
been found to obey the laws of fractals. Perhaps Magick and the heavenly
cosmologies are fractals of the Higher Will? Perhaps our True Will is a
fractal? Maybe fractals are the new Ogham, the new Wheel of Fionn?
        
                           &quot;Transformations&quot;
 
If an idea can be reduced to mathematical or Magickal symbols, then it
can also be manipulated or transformed. These relation-ships are called
&quot;veils&quot; or &quot;pathworkings&quot; in Magickal works. In mathematics, such
transformations occur frequently. What is complex in one domain is
simple in another.  Engineers use such techniques as vector and
tensor analysis to handle complex systems all the time. Magicians use
the principle, &quot;As Above , So Below&quot; to aid their Magickal Workings.
Sometimes this Magickal work is also done while using symbollic logic to
aid in the act of manifesting or &quot;making&quot; a new creation. We will next
discuss how some of these Magickal transformations are done.
        
                          &quot;Vibratory States&quot;
 
The addition of external energy to a molecule or the introduction of
additional molecules into a solution causes its electron configuartion
to change. The electron &quot;jumps&quot; across an energy barrier to obtain a
different orbit or geometry.  The Molecule changes its behavior,
sometimes with amazing results. This change in electrons through levels
or states of energy is directly analogous to the levels or states of
vibration that a Magician goes through to &quot;resonate&quot; with other
spiritual forces. These principles of resonance and vibration are the
keys to the techniques of OOBE and energy transfer in Magickal systems.
To discover how we as Magickal/Spiritual entities can go through these
types of transformed states, I looked at my own experiences, once again.
 
                        &quot;Personal Experiences&quot;
 
The keys to working Magick are BELIEF, DISCIPLINE and FOCUS. Focus is a
matter of personal ability and is sharpened through practice and effort. 
Discipline is inherit to our very natures. Belief is absolutely 
3256

necessary to any Magickal Work. I have had three types of personal
experiences that are the foundation of my BELIEF in MAGICK.
 
                        &quot;The All from the None&quot;
 
This experience I have discussed before. It is the first veil that must
be passed to obtain BELIEF in Magick and the resulting Powers. Briefly
stated, I was able to detach from the ordinary (while conscious) and
encounter Spirit and Magickal Beings.  These experiences have reinforced
my ability to work Astrally and Magickally. The secrets to this
experience are meditation, inner quietness and the increased vibrational
level of the spirit or &quot;ecstasy&quot;.
 
By going into the &quot;void&quot; of Nothingness, I was touched by the Power of
the Akasha! Anyone can do this, if they are willing to put in the time
and effort to meditate to achieve inner &quot;quietness&quot;.  The &quot;Void&quot; is the
place where the Will can focus to create and produce all Magick!
 
                        &quot;The None From the All&quot;
 
These are experiences I have had from &quot;lucid dreaming&quot;. I have basically
been able to go anywhere and do anything in my dreams. I have had many
revelations and Super Normal experiences in these dreams. I guess the
most outrageous experience was experiencing &quot;death&quot;. Some deaths were
just an abrupt end to one existence while manifesting into another body
and another existence. One particular &quot;death&quot; was at the center of an
exploding sun or bomb. I was literally blown into Nothingness and
Non-Existence. I &quot;floated&quot; there in endless time without thought or
being. I just was.  Only my Will still existed and through the exertion
of my Will I was able to awaken into my body once more. This was not and
ordinary dream. In fact, I'm not really sure this is the Reality I
started out in! &lt;GGG&gt;  A Powerful incentive to learn more about Magick
(to prevent such a thing from ever happening again)!!!!!
 
                                &quot;IDIC&quot;
 
IDIC is borrowed from the Vulcan, Mr. Spock. It stands for Infinite
Diversity in Infinite Combinations. This basically means the Universe
is filled with possibilities and that anything can (and will) happen.
This is all those strange events that can be dismissed if taken one at
a time but will stagger you if you keep a log of them. This includes
such things in my life as:  Flying or &quot;floating&quot; in the air by myself, 
reading minds, seeing the future, seeing creatures that are in another
plane, hearing the music of the Sidhe and incredible feats of strength
and speed (that could not possible have happened). All these many events
taken together point to a variety of techniques that people can do. The
secret is in remembering how we did it!!! Or maybe in finding a really
excellent teacher. I am the worst of students but I am very persis-
tent!&lt;GGG&gt;
 
                         &quot;The Charm of Making&quot;
 
The following is the merest sketch of an outline for performming the
Charm of Making, the very same chant that Merlin was heard to use in the
movie &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Much of this ritual comes from the following works:
&quot;The 21 Lessons of Merlin&quot;, &quot;Celtic Magic', &quot;Witta&quot;, &quot;The Irish Celtic
Magical Tradition&quot; and the &quot;Sacred Cauldon&quot;. Some of it is changed to
suit my personal (*Irish*) preferences!&lt;G&gt;

                        &quot;Circles of Drai'ocht &quot;
 
Druids' Circles are very similar to other Magickal Circles. Each
direction should have a candle and color associated with it.  (I use Red
for East, White for South, Grey or Blue for West and Black for North).
I also have candles for the God and the Goddess.  these are usually
Green and Red respectively.  I light the candles as the Spirits are
invoked.
 
                            &quot;The Guardians&quot;

                             &quot;The Words of Power&quot;
 
After the Guardians have been called, then the Words of Power Are Spoken
and the Rite or Sign of Three Rays is performed for each of the
Quarters.
 
                                        &quot;IAO&quot;
 
This is the name of the God/dess of All and is intoned three times while
making the appropriate hand gestures,
 
                                &quot;EEEEE-Ahhhhhh-OOOOO&quot;.
                                &quot;EEEEE-Ahhhhhh-OOOOO&quot;.
                                &quot;EEEEE-Ahhhhhh-OOOOO&quot;.
 
                                &quot;Threshold Experiences&quot;
 
If a portal to another plane or place is to be opened then the following
Charm of Making is to be said three times (this Charm uses the Power of
Sea and Stone):
 
                              &quot;A ELFNTODD DWYR SINDDYN DUW
                               CERRIG YR FFERLLURUG NWYN;

                               FEWR ECHLYN MOR, NECROMBOR LLUN&quot;
 
                                                   &quot;Dragon's Breath&quot;
 
If something is to be caused to happen or prevented then the following
Charm of Making is intoned three times (this charm invokes the Powers of
Fire and Air):
 
                                    &quot;ANAIL NATHROCK
                                     UTHVASS BETHUDD
                                     DOCHIEL DIENVE&quot;
 
At this point the Power has been raised. The Will of the Draoi' should
be directed and stated forcefully in the direction of greatest Power
using the sign for that Quarter. Once the work, is completed, the
God/desses and Guardians should be thanked and the Power Earthed by 
lowering both hands to the ground while kneeling.  The Circle is opened
in the reverse of its creation and the bounty of the Land and Tuatha
should be enjoined and enjoyed by all.
 
This is the end of the prepared presentation on the Charm of &quot;Making&quot;.
This and &quot;Pathworking&quot; are the two most powerful abilities of a Druid.

       Celtic Workshop #14 - &quot;The Wheel of Elements or Seasons&quot;

Forum member Freepowder noted similarities between the Plains Indian
Medicine Wheels and Fionn's Wheel from Celtics sources. His analysis and
presentation on these topics led into a discussion of other cross 
3261

cultural similarities. I added some info from a study of the indigenous
peoples of the world as well as Celtic topics. 

Tonight our man of many names, Freepowder, O'Ba'n,John White, Sir Freep,
etc. will give us his thoughts on the wheel and the directions as
compared between the Plains Indians and the Celts.  It looks to be
good!&lt;GGG&gt; I may have a few comments of my own. I also have some info on
thses directions compiled by a noted anthropologist, Angeles Arriens,
for the indiginous peoples of the world. I hope we can discuss the use
and meanings of directions to all of us in our magical work.
 
                                    &quot;The Wheel of Elements or Seasons&quot;
 
The world over, aboriginal religions have used the circle as a symbol of
the world, the cosmos and the spirit.  Tonite I will attempt to draw
some parallels between the Celtic version, Fionn's wheel or window and
the Plains Indian version, the Medicine wheel.  Both of these wheels are
pictured as a circle bisected by two lines, one vertical and one
horizontal. In Plains Indian (PI from here on) the circle represents the
cycles of the earth, of learning and of life. 
 
The lines represent the 'roads' one must travel to achieve enlighten-
ment.  The points at which the lines intersect the circle signify the
four directions, east to the right, south at the bottom, west to the
left, and north at the top.  There are qualities and totems (animal
spirit guides) assigned to each direction. The totems and qualities
vary somewhat, tribe to tribe, and the following is an attempt to
combine several, mostly Lakota (Sioux) and Tsisistis (Cheyenne)   .
 
                                    East: 
red, illunination, child, the sun, spring, the source of life, 
eagle, hawk and birds generally

                        South: 
yellow, innocence, youth, daylight, summer, fullness of life, snake,
lizard, mouse, horse, elk

                        West: 
black or blue, introspection, maturity, sunset, autumn, waning of life,
thunder beings, Bear, buffalo

                        North: 
white, wisdom, old age, night, winter, death, wolf, raven, buffalo
 
The PI speak of the guardians of the quarters as 'Grandfathers' or
'Grandmothers'. Animals in mundane life are refered to as 'Little
Brother or Sister.' At the center of the wheel is,in Lakota, 'Wakan
Tanka', the Great Mystery. The source of all life, of all that is.
Although Wakan Tanka is refered to as Grandfather, it has no sex, no
body, it is at once the creator and all of creation. Also at the center
is White Buffalo woman (or Sweet Medicine to the Cheyenne), the
personification of the earth, and the female aspect of Wakan Tanka.
 
The cycle of life as illustrated by the Medicine Wheel starts at the
east. The PI believe that as an infant a person knows all things, thus
the connection with enlightenment. As you grow into youth these things
are forgotten so you may learn, and grow, symbolised by the south and
innocence. When you are mature you move to the west and introspection. 
3262

Here you take your vision quest. As you approach old age you achieve
wisdom in the north and, if you survive you return to the enlightenment
of the east.
                        On to the Celts!
 
The Celts use either a four spoked wheel, identical to the medicine
wheel in apearance or enhance the image with 'cross quarters' making an
eight spoked wheel. One differnce in the Celtic version of the Wheel, is
probaly due to the variation in weather patterns between the Britsh
Isles and the Great Plains. The Britsh Isles are around 1000 miles north
of the Plains causing several things to happen. The sun, even at
midsummer will rise far further to the north in Britain. Britain's
proximity to the trade winds cause the prevailing winds to come from
differnt directions. Therefore the Celts start their journey of life in
the north.  The qualities of the quarters areremarkably similar if
somewhat skewed as to direction. (Note: the animals assigned to quarters
and cross quarters are approximate and individual impressions as to what
animal goes where are most important IMHO)   
 
                                    They are:
 
                        North: 
black, winter, wisdom, clarity, death, earth, animals, minerals,
fallowness, darkness, winter solstice, salmon, wolf, the Morrigan, 

                        East: 
red, spring, inspiration, life, birth, renewal, air, birds, smell,
dryness, germination, spring equinox, otter, crow

                        South: 
white, summer, spirit, humanity, change, power, fire, sun, light,
vegatables, summer solstice, bear, hawk,

                        West:  
grey, autumn, creativity, ripeness, fertility, compassion, love,
emotions, hearing, water, moon, twilight, fish, autumn equinox, stag,
hound
 
The cross quarters mark the seasonal festivals, have associated animals
and are used to represent the ages of mankind:
        
                                Imbolc: 31 Jan, child, eagle
                                Beltaine: 30 Apr, youth, sow
                                Lughnasadh: 31 Jul, adult, horse
                                Samhain: 31 Oct, elder, heron
 
The Celts assign Gods and Goddesses to the quarters as well. The
following courtesy of O'Dubh, and subject to interpretation. God/esses
are directional &lt;G&gt; as follows:
 
                        North: 
Master Morfessa of Falias, The Morrighan, Goibhniu, The Dagdha, Epona,
Eriu, Macha (The Land, the Lia Fal, Magick, Soveriegnty)   

                        East: 
Master Uscias of Findias Danu, Anu, Lir, Lugh, Bridget, Scathach, Ogma,
Nuada (The Invincible Sword, Wisdom, Strength, the Winds)   
                        South: 
3263

Master Esras from Gorias The Dagdha, Lugh, Bridget, Danu (The Flaming
Spear, Action, Fire, the Sun or Shining One)   

                        West: 
Master Semias from Murias, Manannan mac Lir, The Dagdha, The Cailleach,
Cerridwen, Danu, Dianecht, Arianrhod (Rebirth, the Undry, the Sacred
Cauldron, the Sea, Water)   
 
Many of these God/desses are assigned to more than one direction because
they have more than one aspect (The Dagdha, Danu, Bridget, Lugh, the
Morrighan). The best way to associate them with a particular direction
is to base their direction upon their role in your Working or upon their
use of the magickal tool involved.
 
The Celts have this multi-faceted diversity in the nature and directions
of their God/desses due to their travels across Europe and their
incorporation of the local Deities into the Deities of their respective
clans.  When they finally stopped their travels, these Deities were then
more fixed in their associated directions and attributes. As modern day
Celts, we have the use of all of these Archetypes to aid or worship and
to enrich our Magicks!

(2-21,cherokee)         the cherokee say that all ancient cultures
descend through the plieades and that the druids and the cherokee have
origins in atlantis the cherokee calendar as are most medicine wheels
are based on the mayan system of time.  The Dogon of W. Africa say the
same.  which is very similar to the celtic most ancient cultures say
they got the wheel from the stars

Also some of the first sailors to come in contact with North American
Indians were Welsh and they could converse with some of the tribes!
Seemed the Indians were speaking Welsh!&lt;G&gt;

(2-21,cherokee)         the cherokee also claim twelve tribes came out
of atlantis when it was destroyed and populated the areas of the earth
bringing this ancient wisdom to other cultures like the 12 tribes of
israel there are 12 clans in the cherokee matrilieage.  There was
contact betwweeen the nordic vikings and the indians after contact with
the celts too.

(2-9,M&amp;J)               As to the NA Indians speaking Welsh, I attended
a Celtic League symposium a year or two back, and this was one of the
talks.  I'll have to go back and review my notes, but as I recall this
is heavily debated.  The accounts go back to a Welsh prince who
supposedly sailed to America.  Whether or not this is true is highly
uncertain.

(2-8,Freepowder)        The Welsh Prince was Madoc, and I believe...
he was supposed to have sailed in the 11th century.... there were
records of his sailing away.... but nothing on where he ended up....he
most certainly never returned to wales.... One possible explanation for
the 'Welsh' Indians is the occurance of grey eyes in some of the
southern tribes, notably... the Choctaw and Cherokee.... There are some
similarities in the languages, but it is possible.. that this is due to
some wandering Celt .... heading east from the orient. &lt;G&gt;

Ok Thanks FP!&lt;G&gt;  There are many other similarities...notably the common
belief among both sets of peoples, the Cherokees and the Celts, that
3264

springs were doorways to the Underworlds and possessed their own
spirits. There are other similarities... The Irish have legends about
the first settlers coming from the west after a flood.

 This was later Christianized to be the daughter of Noah Ceasir....but
it was first thought to be Atlantis. Also some of the alignments of the
stone circles are on the Pleides.  In fact, The two major hubs of the
Celtic year are connected to when the Pleides first ascend into the
constellation of Taurus That is when Bealtaine and Samhain actually
occur.
 
As to use in your magickal workings, given the eclectic nature of most
American Mages, introduction of the Plains Indian version of the
attributes of the quarters is allowable. Perhaps even justified given
our geographical location. I personally use the Indian colors and
animals in conjunction with the Celtic God/esses. As they used to say in
the Toyota comercials, 'It just feels right.' &lt;G&gt;

Ok I have another set of values for directions.  Then a brief discussion
