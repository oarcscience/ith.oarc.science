# Samhain ritual for a small Circle

\[*older woman to older man*\]:  
One-eye, Wanderer, God of wisdom,  
Hunt-lord, hail, who leads the hosting!  
Nine nights hanging, knowledge gaining,  
Cloaked at crossroads, council hidden.  
Now the night, your time, is near us --  
Right roads send us on, Rune-winner.

\[*older man to older woman*\]:  
Every age your eye has witnessed;  
Cauldron-Keeper, hail wise Crone!  
Rede in riddles is your ration --  
Wyrd-weaving at the World-tree's root.  
Eldest ancient, all-knowing one,  
Speak secrets to us, send us vision.

\[*younger woman to younger man*\]:  
Lord of Life, hail Land-Master!  
God of grain that grows and dies  
And rises reborn, full of richness;  
Fallow fields shall yet be fertile --  
Spring sap runs as stirs your phallus  
Bless barren earth, let it bear again!

\[*younger man to younger woman*\]:  
Snow-shoes striding, hail swift Huntress!  
Wild one, free and willful Goddess  
Bow and blade you bear beside you,  
Finding food to fend off hunger --  
Winter will not leave us wanting;  
Give good hunting, grant us skill.

### USHERING IN THE NEW YEAR:

Welcome winter, waning season,  
Now with night the new year comes;  
Hail the horse's head with blessings --  
Blessings be on those who bide here  
And indeed on all the world!

### SCRYING:

Wide are the worldgates,  
Sights to be sent us;  
Ready for rede-gifts,  
We wait for your wisdom.

### OFFERINGS/THANKSGIVING:

Grateful, we give now, gifts of our own  
Heart-work and hand-work the hearth shall grace;  
Happiness, harmony, health in the new year,  
Send to the world and we in it, we wish you.

### DISMISSAL/OPENING:

To watching winds we wish fair travelling;  
To sleepless dead sweet rest we send;  
Gods and Goddesses, go with praises --  
See: the circle is severed thus. \[*cut with sword at east*\]

I wrote that ritual for David, myself and two friends who are older than
we. It was the first ritual that I wrote not based on NROOGD material in
any way, but on entirely original structure and material. The horse's
skull is a primitive form of the Mari Lwyd (Grey Mare/Mary), a Welsh
folk traditional hobby horse that goes from house to house at the
calendar New Year, but she's such a bizarre and macabre beast that she
was almost certainly a Samhain leftover. There's interesting material
about her in Trefor Owen's "Welsh Folk Customs" (which is probably out
of print, but I could provide photocopies for interested parties who
provide copying costs...)

Happy Samhain!
