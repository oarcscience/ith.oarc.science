                                       The Wiccan Rede (WCC) 


              Bide ye Wiccan laws ye must, 
              in perfect love and perfect trust
                   Live ye must and let to live, 
                   fairly take and fairly give
              Form the circle thrice about, 
              to keep unwelcome spirits out
                   To bind the spell well every time, 
                   let the spell be spake in rhyme
              Soft of eye and light of touch, 
              speak ye little, listen much
                   Deosil go by the waxing moon, 
                   sing and dance the Wiccan rune
              Widdershins go by the waning moon, 
              chanting out the baleful tune
                   When the Lady's moon is new, 
                   kiss the hand to her times two
              When the moon rides at Her peak, 
              then the heart's desire seek
                   Heed the north wind's mighty gale, 
                   lock the door and trim the sail
              When the wind comes from the south, 
              love will kiss kiss thee on the mouth
                   When the wind blows from the west, 
                   departed souls will have no rest
              When the wind blows from the east, 
              expect the new and set the feast
                   Nine woods in the cauldron go, 
                   burn them quick and burn them slow
              Elder be the Lady's tree, 
              burn it not or cursed you'll be
                   When the wheel begins to turn, 
                   soon the Beltain fires will burn
              When the wheel has turned to Yule, 
              light the log the Horned One rules
                   Heed ye flower, bush and tree, 
                   by the Lady blessed be
              Where the rippling waters flow, 
              cast a stone and the truth you'll know
                   When you have and hold a need, 
                   hearken not to others' greed
              With a fool no season spend, 
              nor be counted as his friend
                   Merry meet and merry part, 
                   bright the cheeks and warm the heart
              Mind the threefold law ye should, 
              three times bad and three times good
                   When misfortune is anow, 
                   wear the star upon thy brow
              True in love you must ever be, 
              lest thy love be false to thee
                   These eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill, 
                   An Ye Harm None, Do What Ye   Will


                                                                                1541
