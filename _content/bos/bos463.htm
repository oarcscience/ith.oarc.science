          CompuServe online Yule Ritual, 1990

          (8-2,DragonHart) Relax....let the worries of the day dissolve
               into the earth under your feet.  Breath deeply.  This is a
               journey, sacred and magical.  Prepare yourself for that
               journey. 
               * 
               Yule is a time of change.  Death and rebirth are the  
               themes that this holiday brings to us.  We enter this sacred
               time anxious for the birth and growth of the Sun God.  We
               naturally go through many changes during this time.  We make
               resolutions to do better, to give up things that keep us
               from growing.
               *
               In our mind's eye we draw a circle of Power.  Our blade
               travels at astounding speeds, dividing us from the rest of
               the natural world.  We are set apart, between worlds. 
               *
               Taking the chalice of water, we sprinkle the circle,  
               feeling the cool liquid on our fingers.  We begin to feel
               the cleansing power of our Mother's blood.  The sprinkling
               finished, we return the chalice to the altar. 
               * 
               The smoke from the censor curls playfully around your
               fingers as you reach to pick it up.  Breath deep of the
               sweet Frankincense and Myrhh as you walk the boundries of
               the circle with it.  Let the scent drive away all negativity
               in you.  When you have finished your sacred task, place the
               censor in it's place on the altar. 
               * 
               Pause a moment to notice the unlit altar candle.
               *
