                                    MONISM, One Wiccan Perspective  
                                            Durwydd MacTara

              "Henotheism  n. Belief  in one  god without  denying the  existence of
              others." (American Heritage Second College Dictionary)

              "Monism n. philos. A metaphysical system in which reality is conceived
                             as a  unified whole." (American Heritage Second College
                             Dictionary)

              "Monotheism n.  The belief or  doctrine that  there is only  one God."
              (American Heritage Second College Dictionary)

              "Pantheism n. 1. The  doctrine identifying the Deity with  the various
              forces and workings of nature. 2. Belief in and worship          o   f
              all gods." (American Heritage Second College Dic            tionary)

              "Polytheism n. The worship of or belief in more than  one god." (Ameri
              can Heritage Second College Dictionary)

              "To witches, deities manifest in different ways and can be
              worshipped and contacted through any form suitable to local
              conditions and personal needs.  Wicca does not believe, as do
              the patriarchal monotheisms, that there is only one correct
              version of God and that all other God forms are false:  the
              Gods of Wicca are not jealous Gods.  We therefore worship the
              personification of the male and female principles, the God and
              the Goddess, recognizing that Gods are aspects of the One God
              and all Goddesses are different aspects of the one Goddess,
              and that ultimately these two are reconciled in the one divine
              essence."
              (Vivianne Crowley, WICCA: The Old Religion in The New Age,pp.
              11-12)


              Vivianne Crowley, a very  capable spokesperson for British Traditional
              Wicca, identifies the core belief of Wicca (at least BTW) as Monism in
              the piece  quoted above.  However, she also opens the door to defining
              Wicca as duotheistic in  principle with the subdivision of  the monist
              reality into the praxis of worshiping both Lord and Lady.

              However, there  is yet a  THIRD level of  obscurity in Wiccan  Praxis!
              Most Wiccans worship a threefold Goddess (Maid, Mother, and Crone) and
              many  also worship at least  a twofold God.  So,  are the Wicca REALLY
              polytheists or perhaps pantheists or even modified Henotheists as some
              have claimed?   Or, perhaps,  a new  category altogether  needs to  be
              invented to accurately describe Wiccan belief and practice.

                        One suggestionhas beenmade toadd aword to ourThea/Theo-logi-
              cal lexicon, perhaps "Cthonotheism" (provided we MUST have a "Theism")
              to  describe "Theistic Wicca".   One  advantage is  that it  makes the
              assumption of worshipping  that which was  there to be found  and wor-
              shipped,  NOT a  Deity  or deities  invented  in 1939!  (More  on this
              later.)

              The  following is the only published copy of the (Gardnerian) Blessing
              Prayer that I know of.

                      "In the name of Dryghtyn, the Ancient Providence,
                       Who was from the beginning and is for eternity,
                       Male and Female, the Original Source of all things;
                       all-knowing, all-pervading, all-powerful;
                       changeless, eternal.

                      "In the name of the Lady of the Moon,
                       and the Lord of Death and Resurrection.

                      "In the name of the Mighty Ones of the Four Quarters,
                       the Kings of the Elements.

                      "Blessed be this place, and this time,
                       and they who are now with us."
              ("Witch Blood!  The Diary Of A Witch High
              Priestess!" by Patricia Crowther in chapter
              four (paperback edition 1974, House Of Collec-
              tibles, Inc.).) Courtesy of David Piper


              The Gawain Poet (the poet who wrote Sir Gawain and the Green
              Knight  in Middle  English) used the  term 'Dryghtyn' to  refer to the
              Lord God.

              At the start of fit IV -

              "Now neghes the Newe Yere and the night passes,
               The day drives to the derk, as Dryghtyn biddes."

              ("Now approaches the New Year and the night passes,
                The daylight comes up on the darkness, as the Lord God bids."

              or from Brian Stowes verse translation (Penguin Classics, 1974) -

               "Now the New Year neared, the night passed,
                Daylight fought darkness as the Deity ordained.")

              Grendel Grettison,  an Asatruar  from Seattle suggests  the "Dryghtyn"
              may be an  alternative   spelling of the  Teutonic "Drighten"  meaning
              "Lord".  I admit  this is interesting, to me, as the  closeness of the
              linguistic link between the  Old English and Old German  languages has
              been a scholarly "fact"  widely known for many years.  Supporting this
              view, the Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word was actually 'dryhtin', meant
              'lord, the Lord'  and is linguistically  related to 'dreogan'  meaning
              'to perform, to serve'.


                                                                                1558
              


              As a side issue, this might be some evidence that runs contrary to the
              thesis  put forth  by Aidan Kelly  that Gerald  Gardner "manufactured"
              Wicca in 1939.  From personal experience, I have found that one unique
              distinction  of the non BTW  strains of Witchcraft  (some times called
              "FamTrads" of Family Traditions) is the incorporation of old Christian
              Imagery,  often including ArchAngels for the  four directions or elem-
              ents.    Though this  instance does  not  include Archangels,  it DOES
              include archaic  (and relatively  unknown) Christian terminology.   If
              Gardner did discover a remnant of the Old Religion upon which he based
              his  modern  reconstruction  effort,  it is  this  sort  of linguistic
              "artifact" which would have survived.  Perhaps a more scholarly
              investigation than mr. Kelly's will "turn up" more evidence?

              Jim Taylor, an  Eastern Orthodox  Theologian, also makes  two (to  me)
              illuminating statements, concerning "The Dryghtyn Prayer":
              1.       "'In the name of Dryghtyn, the Ancient Providence,
                       Who was from the beginning and is for eternity,
                       Male and Female, the Original Source of all things;
                       all-knowing, all-pervading, all-powerful;
                       changeless, eternal.'
              This would be, entirely, an acceptable way of describing God, both for
              most Jews and for most Christians."
                                                  AND
              2.       "'In the name of the Lady of the Moon,
                       and the Lord of Death and Resurrection.'
              The Lord of  Death and  Resurrection would seem,  to any Christian  to
              refer to Jesus Christ."

              This  evidence of a possible mixing of an older (unrecorded) Christian
              Prayer may lend further credence to Gardners' claims of building on an
              older, hidden, traditional remnant.

              I, personally, also agree  with Mr. Taylors' statement that  "the idea
              of Wicca  being 'manufactured' in 1939  is far too pat,  and ignores a
              great deal  which ought not  to be ignored.   At the  very least, some
              degree   of  recognition should be  accorded to the  obvious fact that
              most  Wiccan practices  and  attitudes predate  Wicca by  considerable
              periods of time--possibly even millennia".

              The existence  of Monism, Duotheism, and  Polytheism simultaneously in
              the  belief structure of Wicca is one  good example of one of the Five
              Mysteries of  Wicca, that of  Union.  Wicca  is a mystery  religion, a
              PARTICIPATORY  religion, and much of  its symbology must  be lived and
              practiced to have  meaning because much of  the real (some say  hidden
              meaning is based on the knowledge of experience and  not the intellec-
              tual knowledge of mere logic and conscious thought processes.

              I am an eclectic Wiccan with strong ties in my beliefs and practice to
              British  Traditional Wicca.   I  am a  Monist, yet  I have  had strong
              direct experience with Brigid, Danu,  and the Morrigan as well as  the
              Earth  Mother and  the Horned  Lord of  the Forests.   So  my personal
              answer to the question  of "What kind of Theism  fits Theistic Wicca?"
              is  "several, or  none; it  is not  really a  valid question  in those
              limited  terms"!  But perhaps the concept of "Cthonotheism" would give
              a better  label to this concept when attempting to discuss the idea of
              the peculiar theism unique to Wicca?
                                       Blessed Be,
                                            Durwydd MacTara


                                                                                1559
