<center><h1>Tool Blessing Ritual</h1>
<h3>A purification of objects for ritual use and their transformation into magical items.</h3>
</center>

<p>(<i>The area is prepared by placing a quantity of each element in the proper
quarter, as well as preparing the altar in the usual way. If available, a
cauldron (empty) is placed in the center of the circle.  Candles are placed
at each  of the four  corners and  lit, progressing deosil  from the  east.
Salt and  water are blessed, and  the celebrants are purified  with them. A
magic circle is cast, and watchtowers summoned.  The god is then drawn down
as follows:<br>
The priest stands before the alter in the Osiris position, arms crossed
across chest and feet together.   The Priestess kneels before him with face
and arms upraised.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>The person consecrating the tools now offers an impromptu or prepared
charge to the items, stating their purpose and mode of use.  They are then

point upwards with the palms facing their own chest, cupping the other's
palm between and holding the tools. They clasp each other with their left arms.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>The priest and priestess kiss, then release grasps.  If the number and size
of the tools precludes them being held in one hand simultaneously, the latter
charging section should be repeated for each. The tools are replaced on the
altar. Cakes and wine are blessed and consumed and a period of relaxation
and rest follows. The watchtowers are then dismissed and the circle opened.</i>)</p>
