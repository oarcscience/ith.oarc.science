                            Orphic invocations of Goddess &amp; God 

          Bright Blessings to all... 
          Here are invocations to the Goddess and God that I have used 
          quite successfully in ritual. They are from the Orphic Hymns, 
          for those who like historical accuracy, but have been updated just  
          a tad, for those who like ritual with modern applications. 
          Hope you enjoy them. 
           
          Invocation to the Goddess 
           
          Divine are Your honors, Oh Mother of the Gods and Nurturer of All. 
          Yoke your swift chariot drawn by bull-slaying lions and, 
          O Mighty Goddess who brings things to pass, join our prayers. 
          Many named and reverend, You are the Queen of the Sky. 
          In the cosmos, Your throne is above all others, for You are

          Queen of the Earth, and You give gentle nourishment to mortals. 
          Goddesses, Gods, and mortals were born of You, 
          And You hold sway over the rivers and all of the sea. 
          Hestia,  Gaia,  Demeter, Inanna,  Isis,  Astarte,  Ishtar, Persephone,
          Diana, 
          Giver of prosperity who bestows upon mortals all manner of gifts, 
          Come to this Rite, Queen whom the drum delights. 
          Honored and loving Nurturer of Life, 
          Joyfully and graciously visit our deeds of piety. 
          Blessed Be. 
           
          Invocation to the God 
           
          Hear Our Prayer, O best and Many-Named God. 
          Fine-haired, solitary, and full of lovely song; 
          Many shaped and noble nurturer of all, 
          Maiden and yout in one, unwithering bloom, O Adonis 
          You vanish and grow again in the fair seasons' turn. 
          Kurnunnos, Pan, Myrddhn, two horned Spirit of growth and blooming; 
          Much loved and wept for are you,  
                  O Fair and Youthful Hunter of the luxuriant mane. 
          Desire is in Your mind and You come to the Goddess 
                  in reverence and respect, 
                  in sensuous joy is your desire fulfilled 
          You are the seed planted in the depths of the Underworld 
          That springs forth, the Green God, that we may sustain our lives. 
          You sacrifice Yourself in gentleness when you are grown. 
          Come Kind-Hearted One, Come Blesseed God,  
                  and bring much joy to all. 
          Blessed Be. 
           
          Hope you find these beneficial... 
          Briget Bless...Phaedra.
