                                  SPELL TO EASE A BROKEN HEART*                     

                                           John Shaman 
                You will need the following ingredients (be sure to charge them all
              before you begin):                                                    
               
              strawberry tea (one bag)     Small wand or stick from a willow tree
              sea salt                     2 pink candles
              a mirror                     one pink drawstring bag
              one quartz crystal           a copper penny
              a bowl made of china or crystal that is special to you
              1 teaspoon dried jasmine     1 teaspoon orris-root powder
              1 tsp. strawberry leaves     1 teaspoon yarrow
              10 plus drops apple-blossom oil or peach oil
              10 plus drops strawberry oil                                          
               
                On a Friday morning or evening (the day sacred to Venus) take a bath
              in sea salt in the light of a pink candle. As you dry off and dress,
              sip the strawberry tea. Use a dab of strawberry oil as perfume or
              cologne. Apply makeup or groom yourself to look your best. Cast a
              circle with the willow wand around a table the the other ingredients.
              Light the second pink candle. Mix all oils and herbs in the bowl.
              While you stir look at yourself in the mirror and say aloud: "Oh,
              Great Mother Goddess, enclose me in your loving arms and nurture and
              bring forth the Goddess within me." Gaze deeply into the mirror after
              you have finished mixing the ingredients and say aloud, "I represent
              the Great Goddess, Mother of all things. I shine in the light of the
              Golden Wings of Isis. All that is great and loving only belongs to
              me." Then put half the mixture in the pink bag and add the penny and
              crystal. Carry it with you always [or until you find another love].
              Leave the other half of the potion in the bowl, out in a room where
              you will smell the fragrance. Repeat this ritual every Friday if
              necessary.                                                            
               
              *From Laurie Cabot's "Power of the Witch"
               Brackets mine.
               
              Needless to say, you should replace the goddess name with one that you
              attune
              to.
