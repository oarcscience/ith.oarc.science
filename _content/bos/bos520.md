                             *              
                                            
                         CAMBRIAN DREAM     
                              -Gwydion PenDerwyn
                              copyright probably to Nemeton
                                            
      In the mountains of Cambria, by Rhymney's bright stream
      I have oft slept in heather, and dreamed a bright Dream
      No mortal could wake me, nor see what I've seen
      No landscape could ever compare.      
                                            
      'Twas the Land of my Fathers, unfettered, and free
      Ere the time that the Saxon swept over the Sea
      When mistletoe grew 'neath the shining Oak Tree
      No landscape could ever compare!      
                                            
      (Chorus): Dreaming of Prydein, asleep on a hill
                When I awaken, will you be there still?
                Oh, Island of Poets, my dreams you can fill
                But never the long waking hours.
                                            
      Mighty Poets and Warriors traversed every road
      Leaving stories and legends wherever they strode
      Their pasts are recalled in the humblest abode
      In tales of the sunnier days.         
                                            
      (Chorus)                              
                                            
      Now my story is ended, my song is all gone
      I have slept thru the evening, and into the dawn
      Yet still, I remember your Face, Albion,
      And your older, and much wiser ways!  
                                            
      (Chorus)                              
                                            
                              *             


                                                                                2311
