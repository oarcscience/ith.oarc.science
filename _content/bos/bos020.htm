<p>Alright, I don't want to sound dumb, but I have no idea what these
rituals entail. What goes on during these, and what is their purpose?<br>

Subject: NEOPAGAN RITUAL</pre>

<p>Boy, you don't ask the easy ones. Dr. Regardie takes 12 volumes to
answer this one; Aleister Crowley, 13 or so; Isaac Bonewits, two (and
that's only introductory).</p>

<p>I'll try to summarize, but if you're really interested, track down
Starhawk's THE SPIRAL DANCE for further details. Most scholars divide
ritual into two classes: 1) theurgic, and 2) thaumaturgic. In fancy
words, this means that either you are praying to make your self &quot;a
better person&quot; or &quot;closer to God/dess&quot; or &quot;to be saved from your sins&quot;,
or you are praying for the God/dess to intervene in the world around
you - prayers for peace, for money, for health, etc.</p>

<p>Neopagan ritual partakes of both aspects, to some extent. In a
typical ritual, various techniques (as old as humanity) are used to
&quot;raise the power,&quot; then the power is focused via magickal symbols to
contact the God(s) and/or Goddess(es) who are being called upon.
He/She/They take that magickal energy, augment it, and return it to
the circle. The High Priest/ess then focuses that energy on the
target - the object or person to be affected, if any - then any
energies that remain (or the total energy, if there is no magickal
target) are returned to the Gods, via a process called &quot;grounding.&quot;</p>

<p>To paraphrase Uncle Isaac's wonderful book on the subject, you have
the wind-up, the pitch, and the follow-through.</p>

<p>The windup uses any ritual techniques that are appropriate to a)
the setting, b) the purpose of the ritual, c) the deities being
contacted, and d) the skills of the participants. The universals are
chanting, dance, and &quot;ritual theatre.&quot; There are, of course, others.</p>

<p>The &quot;pitch&quot; uses beautiful, poetic imagery in guided meditations
and ritual movement. Occasionally (if possible), this uses music and
dance. Once the gods are contacted and the energy flows, it is
concentrated in an object - usually cakes and wine, but occasionally
by other means - and distributed, symbolically to all the
participants. Having partaken of the energy thus raised, the guided
meditations direct the people in focusing their energy on the purpose
at hand.</p>

<p>Finally, the High Priest or Priestess goes through a
&quot;follow-through&quot;, which involves dissolving the &quot;group mind&quot;,
reassuring people that what we have worked is done and was effective,
and then &quot;grounding&quot; any loose energies, so that when the group leaves
the ritual circle, they are back in their normal minds.</p>

<p>As I write, it occurs to me that the real answer to your question
lies in that last sentence - &quot;back in their normal minds.&quot; Neopagan
ritual is a collection of tools and techniques for altering your
consciousness, temporarily, to a place where the Gods and Goddesses
are real and near, where we as their children and lovers and friends
can worship them, and where the magick we work can come true. Having
convinced ourselves of this, we act on it, then return to our daily
lives refreshed.</p>

<p>(Gods, what a bunch of gibberish! You would have been better off reading the books!)</p>

<p>Anyway, I tried. Anyone else (esp. Black Dragon if he shows up
again, as he's worked at least as much ritual as I) please feel free
to add or comment. Was this the kind of answer you wanted, Curly?</p>
