<h1>Two Witches</h1><h2>A Modern Craft Fairy-Tale</h2>
<h4>by Mike Nichols</h4></center>

<p>Once upon a  time, there were two  Witches.  One was  a Feminist Witch
and the other was a Traditionalist Witch.  And, although both  of them were
deeply religious, they had rather different ideas about what their religion
meant.  The Feminist Witch tended to believe that Witchcraft was a religion
especially suited to  women because the image of the Goddess was empowering
and a strong weapon against patriarchal tyranny.  And there was distrust in
the heart of the Feminist Witch for  the Traditionalist Witch because, from
the Feminist perspective, the Traditionalist Witch seemed subversive and a 
threat to &quot;the Cause&quot;.</p>

<p>The  Traditionalist Witch  tended  to believe  that  Witchcraft was  a
religion for  both men and women  because anything less would  be divisive.
And although  the  Goddess was  worshipped, care  was taken  to give  equal
stress to the God-force in nature, the  Horned One.  And there was distrust
in  the heart of the  Traditionalist Witch for  the Feminist Witch because,
from  the  Traditionalist  viewpoint,  the  Feminist  Witch  seemed  like a
late-comer and a threat to &quot;Tradition&quot;. These two Witches lived in the
same community  but each belonged  to a  different Coven, so  they did  not
often run into  one another.  Strange to say, the  few times they did meet,
they felt an odd sort of mutual attraction, at least on the physical level.
But both recognized the folly of this attraction, for their ideologies were
worlds apart, and nothing, it seemed, could ever bridge them.</p>

<p>Then one year the community decided to hold a Grand Coven, and all the
Covens in the area were invited to attend.  After the rituals, the singing,
the  magicks, the  feasting, the  poetry, and  dancing were  concluded, all
retired to  their tents and  sleeping bags.  All  but these two.   For they
were troubled by their differences and couldn't sleep.  They alone remained
sitting by the  campfire while all others around them  dreamed.  And before
long, they began to talk about their differing  views of the Goddess.  And,
since they were both  relatively inexperienced Witches, they soon  began to
argue about what was the &quot;true&quot; image of the Goddess.</p>

<p>&quot;Describe your image of the Goddess to me,&quot; challenged the 
Feminist Witch. The Traditionalist Witch smiled, sighed, and said in a rapt
voice, &quot;She  is the  embodiment  of all  loveliness.   The quintessence  of
feminine beauty.  I picture her with silver-blond hair like moonlight, rich
and thick, falling down around her  soft shoulders.  She has the voluptuous
young body  of  a  maiden in  her  prime,  and  her clothes  are  the  most
seductive, gossamer thin and clinging to her willowy frame.  I see her 
dancing like a  young elfin nymph in a moonlit glade, the dance of a temple
priestess.  And she  calls to her lover, the Horned One, in a voice that is
gentle and soft  and sweet, and  as musical as a  silver bell frosted  with
ice.   She is Aphrodite, goddess  of sensual love.  And  her lover comes in
answer to  her call, for she is destined to  become the Great Mother.  That
is how I see the Goddess.&quot;</p>

<p>The Feminist Witch hooted  with laughter and said, &quot;Your Goddess  is a
Cosmic Barbie  Doll!  The Jungian archetype of a  cheer-leader!  She is all
glitter and no substance.   Where is her strength?   Her power?  I  see the
Goddess very  differently.  To  me, she is  the embodiment of  strength and
courage  and wisdom.   A  living symbol  of the  collective power  of women
everywhere.  I picture her with hair as black as a moonless night, cropped 
short for ease  of care on the field of battle.   She has the muscular body
of a woman at the peak of health and fitness.  And her clothes are the most
practical  and sensible, not slinky  cocktail dresses.   She does not paint
her face or perfume  her hair or shave her  legs to please men's  vanities.
Nor does she do  pornographic dances to attract a man to her.  For when she
calls to a  male, in a voice that  is strong and defiant, it will  be to do
battle with the repressive masculine ego.  She is Artemis the huntress, and
it is fatal for  any man to cast a  leering glance in her direction.   For,
although she may be the many-breasted Mother, she is also the dark Crone of
wisdom, who destroys the old order.  That is how I see the Goddess.&quot;</p>

<p>Now  the Traditionalist  Witch hooted  with  laughter and  said, &quot;Your
Goddess  is the antithesis of  all that is feminine!   She is Yahweh hiding
behind a feminine mask!  Don't forget  that it was his followers who burned
Witches  at the stake for the &quot;sin&quot; of  having &quot;painted faces&quot;.  After all,
Witches  with their knowledge of herbs were  the ones who developed the art
of cosmetics.  So what of beauty?  What of love and desire?&quot;</p>

<p>And so the argument raged, until the sound of their  voices awakened a
Coven Elder  who was sleeping nearby.   The Elder looked  from the Feminist
Witch to the Traditionalist Witch and back again, saying nothing for a long
moment.  Then the Elder suggested that both Witches go into the woods apart
from one another and there, by magick and meditation, that each seek a 
&quot;true&quot; vision of the Goddess.  This they both agreed to do.</p>

<p>After  a time of invocations, there was a moment of perfect stillness.
Then a glimmer of light could be seen in the forest, a light shaded deepest
green  by the  dense foliage.   Both Witches  ran toward the  source of the
radiance.  To their  wonder and amazement, they discovered the  Goddess had
appeared  in a clearing directly between  them, so that neither Witch could
see the other.  And the Traditionalist Witch yelled &quot;What did I tell  you!&quot;
at the  same instant the Feminist Witch yelled  &quot;You see, I was right!&quot; and
so neither Witch heard the other.</p>

<p>To the  Feminist Witch, the Goddess  seemed to be a  shining matrix of
power and  strength, with courage and energy  flowing outward.  The Goddess
seemed  to be  holding out  her arms  to embrace  the Feminist Witch,  as a
comrade in arms.  To the Traditionalist Witch, the Goddess seemed to be the
zenith of feminine beauty, lightly playing a harp and singing a siren song 
of seduction.   Energy seemed to flow towards her.   And she seemed to hold
out her arms to the Traditionalist Witch, invitingly.</p>

<p>From opposite sides of the clearing, the Witches ran toward the figure
of  the Goddess they both loved so well, desiring to be held in the ecstasy
of that divine embrace.   But just before they reached her,  the apparition
vanished. And the two Witches were startled to find themselves 
embracing each other.</p>

<p>And then they both heard the voice of the Goddess.  And, oddly enough,
it sounded exactly the same to both of them.  It sounded like laughter.</p>
