I have found in a history of the Spaniards
that in their wars with the English Archimedes
of Syracuse who at that time was living
at the court of Ecliderides, King of the
Cirodastri. And in maritime warfare he ordered that
the ships should have tall masts, and that on
their tops there should be a spar fixed &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_532"><FONT SIZE="1">832</FONT></A>
 of
40 feet long and one third of a foot thick. At
one end of this was a small grappling iron and
at the other a counterpoise; and there was also
attached 12 feet of chain; and, at the end of
this chain, as much rope as would reach from
the chain to the base of the top, where it was
fixed with a small rope; from this base it ran
down to the bottom of the mast where a
very strong spar was attached and to this
was fastened the end of the rope. But to go on
to the use of his machine; I say that below
this grappling iron was a fire &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">833</FONT></A>
 which, with
tremendous noise, threw down its rays and
a shower of burning pitch; which, pouring
down on the [enemy's] top, compelled the
men who were in it to abandon the top
to which the grappling-iron had clung. This
was hooked on to the edges of the top
and then suddenly the cord attached at the
base of the top to support the cord which
went from the grappling iron, was cut, giving
way and drawing in the enemy's ship; and
if the anchor--was cast ...

<P><A NAME="fn_534"></A><A HREF="1498.htm#fr_534">451:834</A> : Archimedes never visited Spain, and the
names here mentioned cannot be explained. Leonardo
seems to quote here from a book, perhaps by some
questionable mediaeval writer. Prof. C. Justi writes to
me from Madrid, that Spanish savants have no knowledge
of the sources from which this story may have
been derived.</P>
