<P>
How figures dressed in a cloak should not show the shape so much as
that the cloak looks as if it were next the flesh; since you surely
cannot wish the cloak to be next the flesh, for you must suppose
that between the flesh and the cloak there are other garments which
prevent the forms of the limbs appearing distinctly through the
cloak. And those limbs which you allow to be seen you must make
thicker so that the other garments may appear to be under the cloak.
But only give something of the true thickness of the limbs to a
nymph &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">198</FONT></A>
 or an
angel, which are represented in thin draperies, pressed and clinging
to the limbs of the figures by the action of the wind.
