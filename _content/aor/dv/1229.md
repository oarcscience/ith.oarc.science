*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1229.

### LIES.

The mole has very small eyes and it always lives under ground; and it
lives as long as it is in the dark but when it comes into the light it
dies immediately, because it becomes known;--and so it is with lies.

### VALOUR.

The lion is never afraid, but rather fights with a bold spirit and
savage onslaught against a multitude of hunters, always seeking to
injure the first that injures him.

### FEAR OR COWARDICE.

The hare is always frightened; and the leaves that fall from the trees
in autumn always keep him in terror and generally put him to flight.
