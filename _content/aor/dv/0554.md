### 554.

### OF THE JUDGMENT TO BE MADE OF A PAINTER'S WORK.

First you must consider whether the figures have the relief required by
their situation and the light which illuminates them; for the shadows
should not be the same at the extreme ends of the composition as in the
middle, because it is one thing when figures are surrounded by shadows
and another when they have shadows only on one side. Those which are in
the middle of the picture are surrounded by shadows, because they are
shaded by the figures which stand between them and the light. And those
are lighted on one side only which stand between the principal group and
the light, because where they do not look towards the light they face
the group and the darkness of the group is thrown on them: and where
they do not face the group they face the brilliant light and it is their
own darkness shadowing them, which appears there.

In the second place observe the distribution or arrangement of figures,
and whether they are distributed appropriately to the circumstances of
the story. Thirdly, whether the figures are actively intent on their
particular business.
