A shadow is never seen as of uniform depth on the surface which
intercepts it unless every portion of that surface is equidistant
from the luminous body. This is proved by the 7th which says:--The
shadow will appear lighter or stronger as it is surrounded by a
darker or a lighter background. And by the 8th of this:--The
background will be in parts darker or lighter, in proportion as it
is farther from or nearer to the luminous body. And:--Of various
spots equally distant from the luminous body those will always be in
the highest light on which the rays fall at the smallest angles: The
outline of the shadow as it falls on inequalities in the surface
will be seen with all the contours similar to those of the body that
casts it, if the eye is placed just where the centre of the light
was.
<P>
The shadow will look darkest where it is farthest from the body that
casts it. The shadow <I>c d</I>, cast by the body in shadow <I>a b</I> which
is equally distant in all parts, is not of equal depth because it is
seen on a back ground of varying brightness. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">93</FONT></A>
