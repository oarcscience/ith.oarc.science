*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 709.

Sculptured figures which appear in motion, will, in their standing
position, actually look as if they were falling forward.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[10:334](0709.htm#fr_0) : *figure di rilievo*.
Leonardo applies this term exclusively to wholly detached figures,
especially to those standing free. This note apparently refers to some
particular case, though we have no knowledge of what that may have been.
If we suppose it to refer to the first model of the equestrian statue of
Francesco Sforza (see the introduction to the notes on Sculpture) this
observation may be regarded as one of his arguments for abandoning the
first scheme of the Sforza Monument, in which the horse was to be
galloping (see page 2). It is also in favour of this theory that the
note is written in a manuscript volume already completed in 1492.
Leonardo's opinions as to the shortcomings of plastic works when
compared with paintings are given under No. 655 and 656.
