*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 828.

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

<span class="margnote"> Advantages in the structure of the eye in
certain animals (828-831).</span>Every object we see will appear larger
at midnight than at midday, and larger in the morning than at midday.

This happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday than
at any other time.

In proportion as the eye or the pupil of the owl is larger in proportion
to the animal than that of man, so much the more light can it see at
night than man can; hence at midday it can see nothing if its pupil does
not diminish; and, in the same way, at night things look larger to it
than by day.
