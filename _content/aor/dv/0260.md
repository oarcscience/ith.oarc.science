### 260.

### DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF A WALL SURFACE WILL BE DARKER OR BRIGHTER IN PROPORTION AS THE LIGHT OR SHADOW FALLS ON THEM AT A LARGER ANGLE.

The foregoing proposition can be clearly proved in this way. Let us say
that *m q* is the luminous body, then *f g* will be the opaque

body; and let *a e* be the above-mentioned plane on which the said
angles fall, showing \[plainly\] the nature and character of their
bases. Then: *a* will be more luminous than *b*; the base of the angle
*a* is larger than that of *b* and it therefore makes a greater angle
which will be *a m q*; and the pyramid *b p m* will be narrower and *m o
c* will be still finer, and so on by degrees, in proportion as they are
nearer to *e*, the pyramids will become narrower and darker. That
portion of the wall will be the darkest where the breadth of the

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

pyramid of shadow is greater than the breadth of the pyramid of light.

At the point *a* the pyramid of light is equal in strength to the
pyramid of shadow, because the base *f g* is equal to the base *r f*. At
the point *d* the pyramid of light is narrower than the pyramid of
shadow by so much as the base *s f* is less than the base *f g*.

Divide the foregoing proposition into two diagrams, one with the
pyramids of light and shadow, the other with the pyramids of light
\[only\].
