*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 381.

Again, a man has even a greater store of strength in his legs than he
needs for his own weight; and to see if this is true, make a man stand
on the shore-sand and then put another man on his back, and you will see
how much he will sink in. Then take the man from off his back and make
him jump straight up as high as he can, and you will find that the print
of his feet will be made deeper by the jump than from having the man on
his back. Hence, here, by 2 methods it is proved that a man has double
the strength he requires to support his own body.
