<P>
Describe landscapes with the wind, and the water, and the setting
and rising of the sun.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE WIND.</H3>
<P>
All the leaves which hung towards the earth by the bending of the
shoots with their branches, are turned up side down by the gusts of
wind, and here their perspective is reversed; for, if the tree is
between you and the quarter of the wind, the leaves which are
towards you remain in their natural aspect, while those on the
opposite side which ought to have their points in a contrary
direction have, by being turned over, their points turned towards
you.
