### PERSPECTIVE.

That side of an object in light and shade which is towards the light
transmits the images of its details more distinctly and immediately to
the eye than the side which is in shadow.

### PERSPECTIVE.

The solar rays reflected on a square mirror will be thrown back to
distant objects in a circular form.

### PERSPECTIVE.

Any white and opaque surface will be partially coloured by reflections
from surrounding objects.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_128"></span>[151:126](0282.htm#fr_128) 281. 282: The title
line of these chapters is in the original simply *"pro"*, which may be
an abbreviation for either *Propositione* or *Prospettiva*--taking
Prospettiva of course in its widest sense, as we often find it used in
Leonardo's writings. The title *"pro"* has here been understood to mean
*Prospettiva*, in accordance with the suggestion afforded by page 10b of
this same MS., where the first section is headed *Prospettiva* in full
(see No. 94), while the four following sections are headed merely
*"pro"* (see No. 85).
