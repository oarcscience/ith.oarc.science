<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><I>Botany for Painters and Elements of Landscape Painting.</I></H3>
<P>
<I>The chapters composing this portion of the work consist of
observations on Form, Light and Shade in Plants, and particularly in
Trees summed up in certain general rules by which the author intends
to guide the artist in the pictorial representation of landscape.</I>
<P>
<I>With these the first principles of a</I> Theory of Landscape painting
<I>are laid down--a theory as profoundly thought out in its main
lines as it is lucidly worked out in its details. In reading these
chapters the conviction is irresistible that such a</I> Botany for
painters <I>is or ought to be of similar importance in the practice of
painting as the principles of the Proportions and Movements of the
human figure</I> i. e. Anatomy for painters.
<P>
<I>There can be no doubt that Leonardo, in laying down these rules,
did not intend to write on Botany in the proper scientific
sense--his own researches on that subject have no place here; it
need only be observed that they are easily distinguished by their
character and contents from those which are here collected and
arranged under the title 'Botany for painters'. In some cases where
this division might appear doubtful,--as for instance in No.</I>
402--<I>the Painter is directly addressed and enjoined to take the
rule to heart as of special importance in his art.</I>
<P>
<I>The original materials are principally derived from MS.</I> G, <I>in
which we often find this subject treated on several pages in
succession without any of that intermixture of other matters, which
is so frequent in Leonardo's writings. This MS., too, is one of the
latest; when it was written, the great painter was already more than
sixty years of age, so we can scarcely doubt that he regarded all he
wrote as his final views on the subject. And the same remark applies
to the chapters from MSS.</I> E <I>and</I> M <I>which were also written
between</I> 1513--15.
<P>
<I>For the sake of clearness, however, it has been desirable to
sacrifice--with few exceptions--the original order of the passages
as written, though it was with much reluctance and only after long
hesitation that I resigned myself to this necessity. Nor do I mean
to impugn the logical connection of the author's ideas in his MS.;
but it</I>
<P><A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A></P>
<P><I>will be easily understood that the sequence of disconnected
notes, as they occurred to Leonardo and were written down from time
to time, might be hardly satisfactory as a systematic arrangement of
his principles. The reader will find in the Appendix an exact
account of the order of the chapters in the original MS. and from
the data there given can restore them at will. As the materials are
here arranged, the structure of the tree as regards the growth of
the branches comes first</I> (394-411) <I>and then the insertion of the
leaves on the stems</I> (412-419). <I>Then follow the laws of Light and
Shade as applied, first, to the leaves (420-434), and, secondly, to
the whole tree and to groups of trees</I> (435-457). <I>After the remarks
on the Light and Shade in landscapes generally</I> (458-464), <I>we find
special observations on that of views of towns and buildings</I>
(465-469). <I>To the theory of Landscape Painting belong also the
passages on the effect of Wind on Trees</I> (470-473) <I>and on the Light
and Shade of Clouds</I> (474-477), <I>since we find in these certain
comparisons with the effect of Light and Shade on Trees</I> (e. g.: <I>in
No.</I> 476, 4. 5; <I>and No.</I> 477, 9. 12). <I>The chapters given in the
Appendix Nos.</I> 478 <I>and</I> 481 <I>have hardly any connection with the
subjects previously treated.</I>
