### 443.

### FROM WHENCE TO DEPICT A LANDSCAPE

Landscapes should be represented so that the trees may be half in light
and half in shadow; but it is better to do them when the sun is covered
with clouds, for then the trees are lighted by the general light of the
sky, and the general darkness of the earth. And then they are darkest in
certain parts in proportion as those parts are nearest to the middle of
the tree and to the earth.
