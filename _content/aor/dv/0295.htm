<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> The rules of aerial perspective (295--297).</FONT></span>There is another kind of perspective which I call Aerial
Perspective, because by the atmosphere we are able to distinguish
the variations in distance of different buildings, which appear
placed on a single line; as, for instance, when we see several
buildings beyond a wall, all of which, as they appear above the top
of the wall, look of the same size, while you wish to represent them
in a picture as more remote one than another and to give the effect
of a somewhat dense atmosphere. You know that in an atmosphere of
equal density the remotest objects seen through it, as mountains, in
consequence of the great quantity of atmosphere between your eye and
them--appear blue and almost of the same hue as the atmosphere
itself &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A>
 when the
sun is in the East &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>
. Hence you must
make the nearest building above the wall of its real colour, but the
more distant ones make less defined and bluer. Those you wish should
look farthest away you must make proportionately bluer; thus, if one
is to be five times as distant, make it five times bluer. And by
this rule the buildings which above a [given] line appear of the
same size, will plainly be distinguished as to which are the more
remote and which larger than the others.

general. H. LUDWIG however translates this passage from the Vatican
copy "<I>wenn namlich die Sonne (dahinter) im Osten steht</I>".</P>
