That portion of a body of uniform breadth which is against a lighter
background will look narrower [than the rest].
<P>
[4] <I>e</I> is a given object, itself dark and of uniform breadth; <I>a b</I>
and <I>c d</I> are two backgrounds one darker than the other; <I>b c</I> is a
bright background, as it might be a spot lighted by the sun through
an aperture in a dark room. Then I say that the object <I>e g</I> will
appear larger at <I>e f</I> than at <I>g h</I>; because <I>e f</I> has a darker
background than <I>g h</I>; and again at <I>f g</I> it will look narrower from
being seen by the eye <I>o</I>, on the light background <I>b c</I>. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A>
 That
part of a luminous body, of equal breadth and brilliancy throughout,
will look largest which is seen against the darkest background; and
the luminous body will seem on fire.
