*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1240.

### THE DRAGON.

This creature entangles itself in the legs of the elephant which falls
upon it, and so both die, and in its death it is avenged.

### THE VIPER.

She, in pairing opens her mouth and at last clenches her teeth and kills
her husband. Then the young ones, growing within her body rend her open
and kill their mother.

### THE SCORPION.

Saliva, spit out when fasting will kill a scorpion. This may be likened
to abstinence from greediness, which removes and heals the ills which
result from that gluttony, and opens the path of virtue.
