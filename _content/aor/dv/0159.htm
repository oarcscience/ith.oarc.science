Shadow is diminution of light.
<P>
Darkness is absence of light.
<P>
Shadow is divided into two kinds, of which the first is called
primary shadow, the second is derived shadow. The primary shadow is
always the basis of the derived shadow.
<P>
The edges of the derived shadow are straight lines.

The darkness of the derived shadow diminishes in proportion as it is
remote from the primary shadow.

<P><A NAME="fn_71"></A><A HREF="0159.htm#fr_71">91:69</A> : The theory of the <I>ombra dirivativa</I>--a technical
expression for which there is no precise English equivalent is
elaborately treated by Leonardo. But both text and diagrams (as <A HREF="p1004.htm#img_pl004">Pl. IV</A>, 1-3 and <A HREF="pl005.htm#img_pl005">Pl. V</A>) must at once convince the student that the
distinction he makes between <I>ombra primitiva</I> and <I>ombra
dirivativa</I> is not merely justifiable but scientific. <I>Ombra
dirivativa</I> is by no means a mere abstract idea. This is easily
proved by repeating the experiment made by Leonardo, and by filling
with smoke the room in which the existence of the <I>ombra dirivativa</I>
is investigated, when the shadow becomes visible. Nor is it
difficult to perceive how much of Leonardo's teaching depended on
this theory. The recognised, but extremely complicated science of
cast shadows--<I>percussione dell' ombre dirivative</I> as Leonardo
calls them--is thus rendered more intelligible if not actually
simpler, and we must assume this theory as our chief guide through
the investigations which follow.</P>
