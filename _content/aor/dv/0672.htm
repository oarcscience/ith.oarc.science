<P>
Il Moro as representing Good Fortune, with hair, and robes, and his
hands in front, and Messer Gualtieri taking him by the robes with a
respectful air from below, having come in from the front [5].
<P>
Again, Poverty in a hideous form running behind a youth. Il Moro
covers him with the skirt of his robe, and with his gilt sceptre he
threatens the monster.
<P>
A plant with its roots in the air to represent one who is at his
last;--a robe and Favour.
<P>
Of tricks [<I>or</I> of magpies] and of burlesque poems [<I>or</I> of
starlings].
<P>
Those who trust themselves to live near him, and who will be a large
crowd, these shall all die cruel deaths; and fathers and mothers
together with their families will be devoured and killed by cruel
creatures.

<P><A NAME="fn_310"></A><A HREF="0672.htm#fr_310">350:308</A> : 1--10 have already been published by <I>Amoretti</I> in
<I>Memorie Storiche</I> cap. XII. He adds this note with regard to
Gualtieri: "<I>A questo M. Gualtieri come ad uomo generoso e benefico
scrive il Bellincioni un Sonetto (pag, 174) per chiedergli un
piacere; e 'l Tantio rendendo ragione a Lodovico il Moro, perche
pubblicasse le Rime del Bellincioni; ci&#242; hammi imposto, gli dice:
l'humano fidele, prudente e sollicito executore delli tuoi
comandamenti Gualtero, che fa in tutte le cose ove tu possi far
utile, ogni studio vi metti.</I>" A somewhat mysterious and evidently
allegorical composition--a pen and ink drawing--at Windsor, see PL
LVIII, contains a group of figures in which perhaps the idea is
worked out which is spoken of in the text, lines 1-5.</P>
