The waves in water magnify the image of an object reflected in it.
<P>
Let <I>a</I> be the sun, and <I>n m</I> the ruffled water, <I>b</I> the image of
the sun when the water is smooth. Let <I>f</I> be the eye which sees the
image in all the waves included within the base of the triangle <I>c e
f</I>. Now the sun reflected in the unruffled surface occupied the
space <I>c d</I>, while in the ruffled surface it covers all the watery
space <I>c e</I> (as is proved in the 4th of my
<P><A NAME="page_145"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 145</FONT></A></P>

 and it will
cover more of the water in proportion as the reflected image is
remote from the eye [10].

<P>
The image of the sun will be more brightly shown in small waves than
in large ones--and this is because the reflections or images of the
sun are more numerous in the small waves than in large ones, and the
more numerous reflections of its radiance give a larger light than
the fewer.
<P>
Waves which intersect like the scales of a fir cone reflect the
image of the sun with the greatest splendour; and this is the case
because the images are as many as the ridges of the waves on which
the sun
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_v214500"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/v214500.jpg"></P>
shines, and the shadows between these waves are small and
not very dark; and the radiance of so many reflections together
becomes united in the image which is transmitted to the eye, so that
these shadows are imperceptible.
<P>
That reflection of the sun will cover most space on the surface of
the water which is most remote from the eye which sees it.
<P>
Let <I>a</I> be the sun, <I>p q</I> the reflection of the sun; <I>a b</I> is the
surface of the water, in which the sun is mirrored, and <I>r</I> the eye
which sees this reflection on the surface of the water occupying the
space <I>o m</I>. <I>c</I> is the eye at a greater distance from the surface
of the water and also from the reflection; hence this reflection
covers a larger space of water, by the distance between <I>n</I> and <I>o</I>.

9: <I>Nel quarto della mia prospettiva</I>. If this reference is to the
diagrams accompanying the text--as is usual with Leonardo--and not
to some particular work, the largest of the diagrams here given must
be meant. It is the lowest and actually the fifth, but he would have
called it the fourth, for the text here given is preceded on the
same page of the manuscript by a passage on whirlpools, with the
diagram belonging to it also reproduced here. The words <I>della mia
prospettiva</I> may therefore indicate that the diagram to the
preceding chapter treating on a heterogeneal subject is to be
excluded. It is a further difficulty that this diagram belongs
properly to lines 9-10 and not to the preceding sentence. The
reflection of the sun in water is also discussed in the Theoretical
part of the Book on Painting; see Vol. I, No. 206, 207.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_120"></A><A HREF="0875.htm#fr_120">145:454</A> : In the original sketch, inside the circle in the first
diagram, is written <I>Sole</I> (sun), and to the right of it <I>luna</I>
(moon). Thus either of these heavenly bodies may be supposed to fill
that space. Within the lower circle is written <I>simulacro</I> (image).
In the two next diagrams at the spot here marked <I>L</I> the word <I>Luna</I>
is written, and in the last <I>sole</I> is written in the top circle at
<I>a</I>.</P>
