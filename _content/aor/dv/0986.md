### 986.

### A DOUBTFUL POINT.

<span class="margnote"> Doubts about the deluge.</span>Here a doubt
arises, and that is: whether the deluge, which happened at the time of
Noah, was universal or not. And it would

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

seem not, for the reasons now to be given: We have it in the Bible that
this deluge lasted 40 days and 40 nights of incessant and universal
rain, and that this rain rose to ten cubits above the highest mountains
in the world. And if it had been that the rain was universal, it would
have covered our globe which is spherical in form. And this spherical
surface is equally distant in every part, from the centre of its sphere;
hence the sphere of the waters being under the same conditions, it is
impossible that the water upon it should move, because water, in itself,
does not move unless it falls; therefore how could the waters of such a
deluge depart, if it is proved that it has no motion? and if it departed
how could it move unless it went upwards? Here, then, natural reasons
are wanting; hence to remove this doubt it is necessary to call in a
miracle to aid us, or else to say that all this water was evaporated by
the heat of the sun.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_186"></span>[209:520](0986.htm#fr_186) : The passages, here
given from the MS. Leic., have hitherto remained unknown. Some
preliminary notes on the subject are to be found in MS. F 80<sup>a</sup>
and 80<sup>b</sup>; but as compared with the fuller treatment here
given, they are, it seems to me, of secondary interest. They contain
nothing that is not repeated here more clearly and fully. LIBRI,
*Histoire des Sciences mathematiques III*, pages 218--221, has printed
the text of F 80<sup>a</sup> and 80<sup>b</sup>, therefore it seemed
desirable to give my reasons for not inserting it in this work.
