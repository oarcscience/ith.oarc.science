<P><A NAME="fn_490"></A><A HREF="1466.htm#fr_490">441:796</A> : 4. <I>Lorenzo</I>. See No. 1351, l. 10 (p. 408). Amoretti
gives the following note in <I>Mem. Stor. XXIII:</I> 1505.
<I>Martedi-sera a di 14 d'aprile. Venne Lorenzo a stare
con mecho: disse essere d'eta d'anni 17 .. a di 15 del
detto aprile ebbi scudi 25 d'oro dal chamerlingo di Santa
Maria nuova.</I> This, he asserts is derived from a MS.
marked S, in quarto. This MS. seems to have
vanished and left no trace behind; Amoretti himself
had not seen it, but copied from a selection of
extracts made by Oltrocchi before the Leonardo
MSS. were conveyed to Paris on the responsibility
of the first French Republic. Lorenzo, by this, must
have been born in 1487. The sculptor Lorenzetto
was born in 1490. Amoretti has been led by the
above passage to make the following absurd observations:
<P>
<I>Cotesto Lorenzo, che poi gli fu sempre compagno, almeno
sin che stette in Italia, sarebb' egli Lorenzo Lotto
bergamasco? Sappiamo essere stato questo valente dipintore
uno de' bravi scolari del Vinci</I> (?).
<P>
<I>Il Fafoia</I>, perhaps a nickname. Cesare da Sesto,
Leonardo's pupil, seems to have been in Rome in these
years, as we learn from a drawing by him in the Louvre.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_491"></A><A HREF="1466.htm#fr_491">441:797</A> : 1466. This seems to be an account for two assistants.
The name of the second is scarcely legible.
The year is not given. The note is nevertheless of
chronological value. The first line tells us the date
when the note was registered, January 3d, and the
observations that follow refer to events of the previous month 'of last year' (dell' anno passato). Leonardo
cannot therefore have written thus in Florence where
the year was, at that period, calculated as beginning
in the month of March (see Vol. I, No. 4, note 2).
He must then have been in Milan. What is more
important is that we thus learn how to date the
beginning of the year in all the notes written at
Milan. This clears up Uzielli's doubts: A Milano
facevasi cominciar l'anno ab incarnatione, cioe il 25
Marzo e a nativitate, cioe il 25 Decembre. Ci sembra
probabile che Leonardo dovesse prescegliere lo stile che era in uso a Firenze. (Ricerche, p. 84, note.)</P>
