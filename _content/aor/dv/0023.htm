<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.</H3>
<P>
Painting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which
are:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position,
Distance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine
will be a tissue [of the studies] of these attributes, reminding the
painter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to
imitate all the works of Nature which adorn the world.
