### 1063.

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

<span class="margnote"> The Appenins (1063-1068).</span>That part of the
earth which was lightest remained farthest from the centre of the world;
and that part of the earth became the lightest over which the greatest
quantity of water flowed. And therefore that part became lightest where
the greatest number of rivers flow; like the Alps which divide Germany
and France from Italy; whence issue the Rhone flowing Southwards, and
the Rhine to the North. The Danube or Tanoia towards the North East, and
the Po to the East, with innumerable rivers which join them, and which
always run turbid with the soil carried by them to the sea.

The shores of the sea are constantly moving towards the middle of the
sea and displace it from its original position. The lowest portion of
the Mediterranean will be reserved for the bed and current of the Nile,
the largest river that flows into that sea. And with it are grouped all
its tributaries, which at first fell into the sea; as may be seen with
the Po and its tributaries, which first fell into that sea, which
between the Appenines and the German Alps was united to the Adriatic
sea.

That the Gallic Alps are the highest part of Europe.
