<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> The Tyrrhene Sea.</FONT></span>Some at the Tyrrhene sea employ this method; that is to say they
fastened an anchor to one end of the yard, and to the other a cord,
of which the lower end was fastened to an anchor; and in battle they
flung this anchor on to the oars of the opponent's boat and by the
use of a capstan drew it to the side; and threw soft soap and tow,
daubed with pitch and set ablaze, on to that side where the anchor
hung; so that in order to escape that fire, the defenders of that
ship had to fly to the opposite side; and in doing this they aided
to the attack, because the galley was more easily drawn to the side
by reason of the counterpoise. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">604</FONT></A>
