*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1357.

I know one who, having promised me much, less than my due, being
disappointed of his presumptuous desires, has tried to deprive me of all
my friends; and as he has found them wise and not pliable to his will,
he has menaced me that, having found means of denouncing me, he would
deprive me of my benefactors. Hence I have informed your Lordship of
this, to the end \[that this man who wishes to sow the usual scandals,
may find no soil fit for sowing the thoughts and deeds of his evil
nature\] so that he, trying to make your Lordship, the instrument of his
iniquitous and maliceous nature may be disappointed of his desire.
