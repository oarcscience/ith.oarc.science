*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1244.

### THE TARANTULA.

The bite of the tarantula fixes a man's mind on one idea; that is on the
thing he was thinking of when he was bitten.

### THE SCREECH-OWL AND THE OWL.

These punish those who are scoffing at them by pecking out their eyes;
for nature has so ordered it, that they may thus be fed.
