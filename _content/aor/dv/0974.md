### 974.

### WATER.

### OF THE MOVEMENT OF A SUDDEN RUSH MADE BY A RIVER IN ITS BEDPREVIOUSLY DRY.

In proportion as the current of the water given forth by the draining of
the lake is slow or rapid in the dry river bed, so will this river be
wider or narrower, or shallower or deeper in one place than another,
according to this proposition: the flow and ebb of the sea which enters
the Mediterranean from the ocean, and of the rivers which meet and
struggle with it, will raise their waters more or less in proportion as
the sea is wider or narrower.
