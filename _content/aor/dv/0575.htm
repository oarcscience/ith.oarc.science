<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE PROOF AND REASON WHY AMONG THE ILLUMINATED PARTS CERTAIN PORTIONS ARE IN HIGHER LIGHT THAN OTHERS.</H3>
<P>
Since it is proved that every definite light is, or seems to be,
derived from one single
<P><A NAME="page_290"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 290</FONT></A></P>
<P>point the side illuminated by it will have
its highest light on the portion where the line of radiance falls
perpendicularly; as is shown above in the lines <I>a g</I>, and also in
<I>a h</I> and in <I>l a</I>; and that portion of the illuminated side will be
least luminous, where the line of incidence strikes it between two
more dissimilar angles, as is seen at <I>b c d</I>. And by this means you
may also know which parts are deprived of light as is seen at <I>m k</I>.
<P>
Where the angles made by the lines of incidence are most equal there
will be the highest light, and where they are most unequal it will
be darkest.
<P>
I will make further mention of the reason of reflections.

right hand side. The small circles above the beginning of lines 5
and 11 as well as the circle above the text on <A HREF="pl031.htm#img_pl031">Pl. XXXI</A>, are in a
paler ink and evidently added by a later hand in order to
distinguish the text as belonging to the <I>Libro di Pittura</I> (see
Prolegomena. No. 12, p. 3). The text on the left hand side of this
page is given as Nos. 577 and 137.</P>
