### 42.

<span class="margnote"> The elements of perspective--Of the Point
(42-46).</span>All the problems of perspective are made clear by the
five terms of mathematicians, which are:--the point, the line, the
angle, the superficies and the solid. The point is unique of its kind.
And the point has neither height, breadth, length, nor depth, whence it
is to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space.
The line is of three kinds, straight, curved and sinuous and it has
neither breadth, height, nor depth. Hence it is indivisible, excepting
in its length, and its ends are two points. The angle is the junction of
two lines in a point.
