Johannes Antonius di Johannes Ambro-
sius de Bolate. He who lets time pass and
does not grow in virtue, the more I think
of it the more I grieve. No man has it in
him to be virtuous who will give up honour
for gain. Good fortune is valueless to him
who knows not toil. The man becomes
happy who follows Christ. There is no perfect
gift without great suffering. Our glories
and our triumphs pass away. Foul lust, and
dreams, and luxury, and sloth have banished
every virtue from the world; so that our
Nature, wandering and perplexed, has almost
lost the old and better track. Henceforth it
were well to rouse thyself from sleep. The
master said that lying in down will not bring
thee to Fame; nor staying beneath the quilts.
He who, without Fame, burns his life to waste,
leaves no more vestige of himself on earth than
wind-blown smoke, or the foam upon the sea.
