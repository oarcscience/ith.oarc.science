### *IV.*

### *Perspective of Disappearance.*

*The theory of the* "Prospettiva de' perdimenti" *would, in many
important details, be quite unintelligible if it had not been led up by
the principles of light and shade on which it is based. The word*
"Prospettiva" *in the language of the time included the principles of
optics; what Leonardo understood by* "Perdimenti" *will be clearly seen
in the early chapters, Nos.* 222--224. *It is in the very nature of the
case that the farther explanations given in the subsequent chapters must
be limited to general rules. The sections given as* 227--231 *"On
indistinctness at short distances" have, it is true, only an indirect
bearing on the subject; but on the other hand, the following chapters,*
232--234, *"On indistinctness at great distances," go fully into the
matter, and in chapters* 235--239, *which treat "Of the importance of
light and shade in the Perspective of Disappearance", the practical
issues are distinctly insisted on in their relation to the theory. This
is naturally followed by the statements as to "the effect of light or
dark backgrounds on the apparent size of bodies"* (*Nos.* 240--250). *At
the end I have placed, in the order of the original, those sections from
the MS.* C *which treat of the "Perspective of Disappearance" and serve
to some extent to complete the treatment of the subject* (251--262).
