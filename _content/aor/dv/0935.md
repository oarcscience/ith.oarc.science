### 935.

### OF THE SEA WHICH CHANGES THE WEIGHT OF THE EARTH.

The shells, oysters, and other similar animals, which originate in
sea-mud, bear witness to the changes of the earth round the centre of
our elements. This is proved thus: Great rivers always run turbid, being
coloured by the earth, which is stirred by the friction of their waters
at the bottom and on their shores; and this wearing disturbs the face of
the strata made by the layers of shells, which lie on the surface of the
marine mud, and which were produced there when the salt waters covered
them; and these strata were covered over again from time to time, with
mud of various thickness, or carried down to the sea by the rivers and
floods of more or less extent; and thus these layers of mud became
raised to such a height, that they came up from the bottom to the air.
At the present time these bottoms are so high that they form hills or
high mountains, and the rivers, which wear away the sides of these
mountains, uncover the strata of these shells, and thus the softened
side of the earth continually rises and the antipodes sink closer to the
centre of the earth, and the ancient bottoms of the seas have become
mountain ridges.
