### 312.

The cut or depression below the lower lip of the mouth is half way
between the bottom of the nose and the bottom of the chin.

The face forms a square in itself; that is its width is from the outer
corner of one eye to the other, and its height is from the very top of
the nose to the bottom of the lower lip of the mouth; then what remains
above and below this square amounts to the height of such another
square, *a* *b* is equal to the space between *c* *d*; *d* *n* in the
same way to *n* *c*, and likewise *s* *r*, *q* *p*, *h* *k* are equal to
each other.

It is as far between *m* and *s* as from the bottom of the nose to the
chin. The ear is exactly as long as the nose. It is as far from *x* to
*j* as from the nose to the chin. The parting of the mouth seen in
profile slopes to the angle of the jaw. The ear should be as high as
from the bottom of the nose to the top of the eye-lid. The space between
the eyes is equal to the width of an eye. The ear is over the middle of
the neck, when seen in profile. The distance from 4 to 5 is equal to
that from *s* to *r*.
