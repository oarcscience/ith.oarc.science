<P>
The cracks in walls will never be parallel unless the part of the
wall that separates from the remainder does not slip down.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">WHAT IS THE LAW BY WHICH BUILDINGS HAVE STABILITY.</H3>
<P>
The stability of buildings is the result of the contrary law to the
two former cases. That is to say that the walls must be all built up
equally, and by degrees, to equal heights all round the building,
and the whole thickness at once, whatever kind of walls they may be.
And although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one it will
not necessarily give way under the added weight day by day and thus,
[16] although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one, it
will not give way under the weight which the latter may acquire from
day to day. Because if double the amount of it dries in one day, one
of double the thickness will dry in two days or thereabouts; thus
the small addition of weight will be balanced by the smaller
difference of time [18].
<P>
The adversary says that <I>a</I> which projects, slips down.
<P>
And here the adversary says that <I>r</I> slips and not <I>c</I>.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HOW TO PROGNOSTICATE THE CAUSES OF CRACKS IN ANY SORT OF WALL.</H3>
<P>
The part of the wall which does not slip is that in which the
obliquity projects and overhangs the portion which has parted from
it and slipped down.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ON THE SITUATION OF FOUNDATIONS AND IN WHAT PLACES THEY ARE A CAUSE OF RUIN.</H3>
<P>
When the crevice in the wall is wider at the top than at the bottom,
it is a manifest sign, that the cause of the fissure in the wall is
remote from the perpendicular line through the crevice.
