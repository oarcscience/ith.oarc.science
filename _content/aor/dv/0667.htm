<P><A NAME="fn_306"></A><A HREF="0667.htm#fr_306">347:304</A> : As this note is in the same small Manuscript as the
passage here immediately preceding it, I may be justified in
assuming that Leonardo meant to use the features of the person here
named as a suitable model for the figure of Christ. The celebrated
drawing of the head of Christ, now hanging in the Brera Gallery at
Milan, has obviously been so much restored that it is now impossible
to say, whether it was ever genuine. We have only to compare it with
the undoubtedly genuine drawings of heads of the disciples in
<A HREF="pl047.htm#img_pl047">Pl. XLVII</A>,  and , to admit that not a single line of the Milan
drawing in its present state can be by the same hand.</P>
