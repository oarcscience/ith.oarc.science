### HOW TO REPRESENT A TEMPEST.

If you wish to represent a tempest consider and arrange well its effects
as seen, when the wind, blowing over the face of the sea and earth,
removes and carries with it such things as are not fixed to the general
mass. And to represent the storm accurately you must first show the
clouds scattered and torn, and flying with the wind, accompanied by
clouds of sand blown up from the sea shore, and boughs and leaves swept
along by the strength and fury of the blast and scattered with other
light objects through the air. Trees and plants must be bent to the
ground, almost as if they would follow the course of the gale, with
their branches twisted out of their natural growth and their leaves
tossed and turned about  <span id="fr_281"></span>[279](#fn_281) . Of
the men who are there some must have fallen to the ground and be
entangled in their garments, and hardly to be recognized for the dust,
while those who remain standing may be behind some tree, with their arms
round it that the wind may not tear them away; others with their hands
over their eyes for the dust, bending to the ground with their clothes
and hair streaming in the wind.  <span id="fr_282"></span>[280](#fn_282)
Let the sea be rough and tempestuous and full of foam whirled among the
lofty waves, while the wind flings the lighter spray through the stormy
air, till it resembles a dense and swathing mist. Of the ships that are

therein some should be shown with rent sails and the tatters fluttering
through the air, with ropes broken and masts split and fallen. And the
ship itself lying in the trough of the sea and wrecked by the fury of
the waves with the men shrieking and clinging to the fragments of the
vessel. Make the clouds driven by the impetuosity of the wind and flung
against the lofty mountain tops, and wreathed and torn like waves
beating upon rocks; the air itself terrible from the deep darkness
caused by the dust and fog and heavy clouds.
