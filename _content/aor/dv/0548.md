### THE PRACTICAL METHODS OF LIGHT AND SHADE AND AERIAL PERSPECTIVE.

### OF PAINTING: OF THE DARKNESS OF THE SHADOWS, OR I MAY SAY, THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LIGHTS.

<span class="margnote"> Gradations of light and shade.</span>Although
practical painters attribute to all shaded objects--trees, fields, hair,
beards and skin--four degrees of darkness in each colour they use: that
is to say first a dark foundation, secondly a spot of colour somewhat
resembling the form of the details, thirdly a somewhat brighter and more
defined portion, fourthly the lights which are more conspicuous than
other parts of the figure; still to me it appears that these gradations
are infinite upon a continuous surface which is in itself infinitely
divisible, and I prove it thus:-- <span
id="fr_263"></span>[261](#fn_263) Let *a g* be a continuous surface and
let *d* be the light which illuminates it; I say--by the 4th
\[proposition\] which says that that side of an illuminated body is most
highly lighted which is nearest to the source of light--that therefore
*g* must be darker than *c* in proportion as the line *d g* is longer
than the line *d c*, and consequently that these gradations of light--or
rather of shadow, are not 4 only, but

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

may be conceived of as infinite, because *c d* is a continuous surface
and every continuous surface is infinitely divisible; hence the
varieties in the length of lines extending between the light and the
illuminated object are infinite, and the proportion of the light will be
the same as that of the length of the lines between them; extending from
the centre of the luminous body to the surface of the illuminated
object.
