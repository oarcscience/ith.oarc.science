\[outlines\] of shadows. Some have misty and ill defined edges, others
distinct ones.

on ground covered with snow, or when snow is falling on the open country
which has no light on it and is surrounded with darkness.

which have limbs and parts, those sides of limbs which face each other
reflect on each other the accidental \[hue and tone\] of their surface.
