### Footnotes

<span id="fn_12"></span>[15:346](0725.htm#fr_12) : In the original,
lines 2-5, 12-14, 33-35, are written on the margin. This passage has
been recently published by G. Govi in Vol. V, Ser. 3a, of *Transunti,
Reale Accademia dei Linea, sed. del 5 Giugno, 1881,* with the following
introductory note: *"Desidero intanto che siano stampati questi pochi
frammenti perche so che sono stati trascritti ultimamente, e verranno
messi in luce tra poco fuori d'Italia. Li ripubblichi pure chi vuole, ma
si sappia almeno che anche tra noi si conoscevano, e s'eran raccolti da
anni per comporne, quando che fosse, una edizione ordinata degli scritti
di Leonardo."*

The learned editor has left out line 22 and has written 3 *pie* for 8
*piedi* in line 25. There are other deviations of less importance from
the original.
