<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE COLOURS OF SIMPLE DERIVED SHADOWS.</H3>
<P>
The colour of derived shadows is always affected by that of the body
towards which they are cast. To prove this: let an opaque body be
placed between the plane <I>s c t d</I> and the blue light <I>d e</I> and the
red light <I>a b</I>, then I say that <I>d e</I>, the blue light, will fall on
the whole surface <I>s c t d</I> excepting at <I>o p</I> which is covered by
the shadow of the body <I>q r</I>, as is shown by the straight lines <I>d q
o e r p</I>. And the same occurs with the light <I>a b</I> which falls on
the whole surface <I>s c t d</I> excepting at the spot obscured by the
shadow <I>q r</I>; as is shown by the lines <I>d q o</I>, and <I>e r p</I>. Hence
we may conclude that the shadow <I>n m</I> is exposed to the blue light
<P><A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A></P>
<P><I>d e</I>; but, as the red light <I>a b</I> cannot fall there, <I>n m</I> will
appear as a blue shadow on a red background tinted with blue,
because on the surface <I>s c t d</I> both lights can fall. But in the
shadows only one single light falls; for this reason these shadows
are of medium depth, since, if no light whatever mingled with the
shadow, it would be of the first degree of darkness &amp;c But in the
shadow at <I>o p</I> the blue light does not fall, because the body <I>q r</I>
interposes and intercepts it there. Only the red light <I>a b</I> falls
there and tinges the shadow of a red hue and so a ruddy shadow
appears on the background of mingled red and blue.
<P>
The shadow of <I>q r</I> at <I>o p</I> is red, being caused by the blue light
<I>d e</I>; and the shadow of <I>q r</I> at <I>o' p'</I> is blue being caused by
the red light <I>a b</I>. Hence we say that the blue light in this
instance causes a red derived shadow from the opaque body <I>q' r'</I>,
while the red light causes the same body to cast a blue derived
shadow; but the primary shadow [on the dark side of the body itself]
is not of either of those hues, but a mixture of red and blue.
<P>
The derived shadows will be equal in depth if they are produced by
lights of equal strength and at an equal distance; this is proved.

luminoso azzurro</I> (blue luminous body); at <I>B, luminoso rosso</I> (red
luminous body). At <I>E</I> we read <I>ombra azzurra</I> (blue tinted shadow)
