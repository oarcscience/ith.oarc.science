### ON THE SECTIONS OF \[THE BOOK ON\] PAINTING.

The first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should
appear in relief, and that the grounds surrounding them at different
distances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground of
the picture by means of the 3 branches of Perspective, which are: the
diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects, the
diminution in their magnitude; and the diminution in their colour. And
of these 3 classes of Perspective the first results from \[the structure
of\] the eye, while the other two are caused by the atmosphere which
intervenes between the eye and the objects seen

by it. The second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due
variety in the figures, so that the men may not all look like brothers,
&c.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_19"></span>[18:17](0017.htm#fr_19) : This and the two
foregoing chapters must have been written in 1513 to 1516. They
undoubtedly indicate the scheme which Leonardo wished to carry out in
arranging his researches on Perspective as applied to Painting. This is
important because it is an evidence against the supposition of H. LUDWIG
and others, that Leonardo had collected his principles of Perspective in
one book so early as before 1500; a Book which, according to the
hypothesis, must have been lost at a very early period, or destroyed
possibly, by the French (!) in 1500 (see H. LUDWIG. L. da Vinci: *Das
Buch van der Malerei*. Vienna 1882 III, 7 and 8).
