<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HOW CASTS OUGHT TO BE POLISHED.</H3>
<P>
Make a bunch of iron wire as thick as thread, and scrub them with
[this and] water; hold a bowl underneath that it may not make a mud
below.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HOW TO REMOVE THE ROUGH EDGES FROM BRONZE.</H3>
<P>
Make an iron rod, after the manner of a large chisel, and with this
rub over those seams on the bronze which remain on the casts of the
guns, and which are caused by the joins in the mould; but make the
tool heavy enough, and let the strokes be long and broad.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">TO FACILITATE MELTING.</H3>
<P>
First alloy part of the metal in the crucible, then put it in the
furnace, and this being in a molten state will assist in beginning
to melt the copper.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">TO PREVENT THE COPPER COOLING IN THE FURNACE.</H3>
<P>
When the copper cools in the furnace, be ready, as soon as you
perceive it, to cut it with a long stick while it is still in a
paste; or if it is quite cold cut it as lead is cut with broad and
large chisels.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE A LARGE CAST.</H3>
<P>
If you have to make a cast of a hundred thousand pounds do it with
two furnaces and with 2000 pounds in each, or as much as 3000 pounds
at most.
