<P>
Towards the end of the fifteenth century the Fabbricceria del Duomo
had to settle on the choice of a model for the crowning and central
part of this vast building. We learn from a notice published by G.
L. Calvi &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">384</FONT></A>
 that among the artists who presented models in the year
1488 were: Bramante, Pietro da Gorgonzola, Luca Paperio (Fancelli),
and Leonardo da Vinci.--
<P>
Several sketches by Leonardo refer to this important project:
<P>
<A HREF="pl099.htm#img_pl099">Pl. XCIX</A>, No. 2 (MS. S. K. III, No. 36a) a small plan of the whole
edifice.--The projecting chapels in the middle of the transept are
wanting here. The nave appears to be shortened and seems to be
approached by an inner "vestibolo".--
<P>
<A HREF="pl100.htm#img_pl100">Pl. C</A>, No. 2 (Tr. 21). Plan of the octagon tower, giving the
disposition of the buttresses; starting from the eight pillars
adjoining the four principal piers and intended to support the eight
angles of the Tiburio. These buttresses correspond exactly with
those described by Bramante as existing in the model presented by
Omodeo.</I> &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">385</FONT></A>

<P>
<I><A HREF="pl100.htm#img_pl100">Pl. C</A>, 3 (MS. Tr. 16). Two plans showing different arrangements of
the buttresses, which seem to be formed partly by the intersection
of a system of pointed arches such as that seen in
<P>
<A HREF="pl100.htm#img_pl100">Pl. C</A>, No. 5 (MS. B, 27a) destined to give a broader base to the
drum. The text underneath is given under No. 788.
<P>
MS. B, 3--three slight sketches of plans in connexion with the
preceding ones.</I>
<P><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A></P>
<P><P>
<I><A HREF="pl099.htm#img_pl099">Pl. XCIX</A>, No.1 (MS. Tr. 15) contains several small sketches of
sections and exterior views of the Dome; some of them show
buttress-walls shaped as inverted arches. Respecting these Leonardo
notes:</I>
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">758.</H3>
<P>
The inverted arch is better for giving a shoulder than the ordinary
one, because the former finds below it a wall resisting its
weakness, whilst the latter finds in its weak part nothing but air.
<P>
<I>Three slight sketches of sections on the same
leaf--above those reproduced here--are more closely connected with
the large drawing in the centre of <A HREF="pl100.htm#img_pl100">Pl. C</A>, No. 4 (M.S, Tr. 41) which
shows a section of a very elevated dome, with double vaults,
connected by ribs and buttresses ingeniously disposed, so as to
bring the weight of the lantern to bear on the base of the dome.
<P>
A sketch underneath it shows a round pillar on which is indicated
which part of its summit is to bear the weight: "il pilastro sara
charicho in . a . b." (The column will bear the weight at a b.)
Another note is above on the right side:</I> Larcho regiera tanto sotto
asse chome di sopra se <I>(The arch supports as much below it [i. e. a
hanging weight] as above it).
<P>
<A HREF="pl100.htm#img_pl100">Pl. C</A>, No. 1 (C. A. 303a). Larger sketch of half section of the
Dome, with a very complicated system of arches, and a double vault.
Each stone is shaped so as to be knit or dovetailed to its
neighbours. Thus the inside of the Dome cannot be seen from below.
<P>
MS. C. A. 303b. A repetition of the preceding sketch with very
slight modifications.</I>

<P>
<I>MS. Tr. 9 (see Fig. 1 and 2). Section of the Dome with reverted
buttresses between the windows, above which iron anchors or chains
seem to be intended. Below is the sketch of the outside.</I>

<P>
<I><A HREF="pl099.htm#img_pl099">Pl. XCIX</A>, No. 3 (C. A., 262a) four sketches of the exterior of the
Dome.
<P>
C. A. 12. Section, showing the points of rupture of a gothic vault,
in evident connection with the sketches described above.
<P>
It deserves to be noticed how easily and apparently without effort,
Leonardo manages to combine gothic details and structure with the
more modern shape of the Dome.
<P>
The following notes are on the same leaf,</I> oni cosa poderosa, <I>and</I>
oni cosa poderosa desidera de(scendere); <I>farther below, several
multiplications most likely intended to calculate the weight of some
parts of the Dome, thus 16 x 47 = 720; 720 x 800 = 176000, next to
which is written:</I> peso del pilastro di 9 teste <I>(weight of the
pillar 9 diameters high).
<P>
Below:</I> 176000 x 8 = 1408000; <I>and below:</I>
<P>
Semjlio e se ce 80 (?) il peso del tiburio <I>(six millions six
hundred (?) 80 the weight of the Dome).
<P>
Bossi hazarded the theory that Leonardo might have been the
architect who built the church of Sta. Maria delle Grazie, but there
is no evidence to support this, either in documents or in the
materials supplied by Leonardos manuscripts and drawings. The sketch
given at the side shows the arrangement of the second and third
socle on the apses of the choir of that church; and it is remarkable
that those sketches, in MS. S. K. M. II2, 2a and Ib, occur with the
passage given in Volume I as No. 665 and 666 referring to the
composition of the Last Supper in the Refectory of that church.</I>
