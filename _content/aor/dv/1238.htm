<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE GRASSHOPPER.</H3>
<P>
This silences the cuckoo with its song. It dies in oil and revives
in vinegar. It sings in the greatest heats
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE BAT.</H3>
<P>
The more light there is the blinder this creature becomes; as those
who gaze most at the sun become most dazzled.--For Vice, that cannot
remain where Virtue appears.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE PARTRIDGE.</H3>
<P>
This bird changes from the female into the male and forgets its
former sex; and out of envy it steals the eggs from others and
hatches them, but the young ones follow the true mother.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SWALLOW.</H3>
<P>
This bird gives sight to its blind young ones by means of celandine.
