*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 837.

<span class="margnote"> On the origin of the soul.</span>Though human
ingenuity may make various inventions which, by the help of various
machines answering the same end, it will never devise any inventions
more beautiful, nor more simple, nor more to the purpose than Nature
does; because in her inventions nothing is wanting, and nothing is
superfluous, and she needs no counterpoise when she makes limbs proper
for motion in the bodies of animals. But she puts into them the soul of
the body, which forms them that is the soul of the mother which first
constructs in the womb the form of the man and in due time awakens the
soul that is to inhabit it. And this at first lies dormant

and under the tutelage of the soul of the mother, who nourishes and
vivifies it by the umbilical vein, with all its spiritual parts, and
this happens because this umbilicus is joined to the placenta and the
cotyledons, by which the child is attached to the mother. And these are
the reason why a wish, a strong craving or a fright or any other mental
suffering in the mother, has more influence on the child than on the
mother; for there are many cases when the child loses its life from
them, &c

This discourse is not in its place here, but will be wanted for the one
on the composition of animated bodies--and the rest of the definition of
the soul I leave to the imaginations of friars, those fathers of the
people who know all secrets by inspiration.

 <span id="fr_100"></span>[434](#fn_100) I leave alone the sacred books;
for they are supreme truth.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_100"></span>[127:434](0837.htm#fr_100) 57: *lettere
incoronate*. By this term Leonardo probably understands not the Bible
only, but the works of the early Fathers, and all the books recognised
as sacred by the Roman Church.
