### 1216.

<span class="margnote"> Nonentity.</span>Every quantity is
intellectually conceivable as infinitely divisible.

\[Amid the vastness of the things among which we live, the existence of
nothingness holds the first place; its function extends over all things
that have no existence, and

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

its essence, as regards time, lies precisely between the past and the
future, and has nothing in the present. This nothingness has the part
equal to the whole, and the whole to the part, the divisible to the
indivisible; and the product of the sum is the same whether we divide or
multiply, and in addition as in subtraction; as is proved by
arithmeticians by their tenth figure which represents zero; and its
power has not extension among the things of Nature.\]

\[What is called Nothingness is to be found only in time and in speech.
In time it stands between the past and future and has no existence in
the present; and thus in speech it is one of the things of which we say:
They are not, or they are impossible.\]

With regard to time, nothingness lies between the past and the future,
and has nothing to do with the present, and as to its nature it is to be
classed among things impossible: hence, from what has been said, it has
no existence; because where there is nothing there would necessarily be
a vacuum.
