<P>
Shadow is the diminution alike of light and of darkness, and stands
between darkness and light.
<P>
A shadow may be infinitely dark, and also of infinite degrees of
absence of darkness.
<P>
The beginnings and ends of shadow lie between the light and darkness
and may be infinitely diminished and infinitely increased. Shadow is
the means by which bodies display their form.
<P>
The forms of bodies could not be understood in detail but for
shadow.
