<P>
<I>Leonardo's researches on the proportions and movements of the human
figure must have been for the most part completed and written before
the year</I> 1498; <I>for LUCA PACIOLO writes, in the dedication to
Ludovico il Moro, of his book</I> Divina Proportione, <I>which was
published in that year:</I> "Leonardo da venci ... hauedo gia co tutta
diligetia al degno libro de pictura e movimenti humani posto fine".
<P>
<I>The selection of Leonardo's axioms contained in the Vatican copy
attributes these words to the author:</I> "e il resto si dira nella
universale misura del huomo". (<I>MANZI, p. 147; LUDWIG, No. 264</I>).
<I>LOMAZZO, again, in his</I> Idea del Tempio della Pittura Milano 1590,
cap. IV, <I>says:</I> "Lionardo Vinci ... dimostro anco in figura tutte
le proporzioni dei membri del corpo umano".
<P>
<I>The Vatican copy includes but very few sections of the</I> "Universale
misura del huomo" <I>and until now nothing has been made known of the
original MSS. on the subject which have supplied the very extensive
materials for this portion of the work. The collection at Windsor,
belonging to her Majesty the Queen, includes by far the most
important part of Leonardo's investigations on this subject,
constituting about half of the whole of the materials here
published; and the large number of original drawings adds greatly to
the interest which the subject itself must command. Luca Paciolo
would seem to have had these MSS. (which I have distinguished by the
initials W. P.) in his mind when he wrote the passage quoted above.
Still, certain notes of a later date--such as Nos. 360,</I>
<P><A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A></P>
<P><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> <I>362 and 363,
from MS. E, written in 1513--14, sufficiently prove that Leonardo did
not consider his earlier studies on the Proportions and Movements of
the Human Figure final and complete, as we might suppose from Luca
Paciolo's statement. Or else he took the subject up again at a
subsequent period, since his former researches had been carried on
at Milan between 1490 and 1500. Indeed it is highly probable that
the anatomical studies which he was pursuing zvith so much zeal
between 1510--16 should have led him to reconsider the subject of
Proportion.</I>
