<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF A WALL SURFACE WILL BE DARKER OR BRIGHTER IN PROPORTION AS THE LIGHT OR SHADOW FALLS ON THEM AT A LARGER ANGLE.</H3>
<P>
The foregoing proposition can be clearly proved in this way. Let us
say that <I>m q</I> is the luminous body, then <I>f g</I> will be the opaque

<p>body; and let <I>a e</I> be the above-mentioned plane on which the said
angles fall, showing [plainly] the nature and character of their
bases. Then: <I>a</I> will be more luminous than <I>b</I>; the base of the
angle <I>a</I> is larger than that of <I>b</I> and it therefore makes a
greater angle which will be <I>a m q</I>; and the pyramid <I>b p m</I> will be
narrower and <I>m o c</I> will be still finer, and so on by degrees, in
proportion as they are nearer to <I>e</I>, the pyramids will become
narrower and darker. That portion of the wall will be the darkest
where the breadth of the
<P><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A></P>
<P>pyramid of shadow is greater than the
breadth of the pyramid of light.
<P>
At the point <I>a</I> the pyramid of light is equal in strength to the
pyramid of shadow, because the base <I>f g</I> is equal to the base <I>r
f</I>. At the point <I>d</I> the pyramid of light is narrower than the
pyramid of shadow by so much as the base <I>s f</I> is less than the base
<I>f g</I>.
<P>
Divide the foregoing proposition into two diagrams, one with the
pyramids of light and shadow, the other with the pyramids of light
[only].
