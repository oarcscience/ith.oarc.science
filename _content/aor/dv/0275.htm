<P>
<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> On the colours of derived shadows (275. 276).</FONT></span>Let <I>n</I> be the source of the shadow <I>e f</I>; it will assume its hue.
Let <I>o</I> be the source of <I>h e</I> which will in the same way be tinged
by its hue and so also the colour of <I>v h</I> will be affected by <I>p</I>
which causes it; and the shadow of the triangle <I>z k y</I> will be
affected by the colour of <I>q</I>, because it is produced by it. [7] In
proportion as <I>c d</I> goes into <I>a d</I>, will <I>n r s</I> be darker than
<I>m</I>; and the rest of the space will be shadowless [11]. <I>f g</I> is
the highest light, because here the whole light of the window <I>a d</I>
falls; and thus on the opaque body <I>m e</I> is in equally high light;
<I>z k y</I> is a triangle which includes the
<P><A NAME="page_148"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 148</FONT></A></P>
<P>deepest shadow, because the
light <I>a d</I> cannot reach any part of it. <I>x h</I> is the 2nd grade of
shadow, because it receives only 1/3 of the light from the window,
that is <I>c d</I>. The third grade of shadow is <I>h e</I>, where two thirds
of the light from the window is visible. The last grade of shadow is
<I>b d e f</I>, because the highest grade of light from the window falls
at <I>f</I>.

No. 148) which are written within the diagram, evidently apply to
both sections and have therefore been inserted in both.</P>
