*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1104.

<span class="margnote"> The Caspian Sea (1105. 1106).</span>From the
shore of the Southern coast of Cilicia may be seen to the South the
beautiful island of Cyprus, which was the realm of the goddess Venus,
and many navigators being attracted by her beauty, had their ships and
rigging broken amidst the reefs, surrounded by the whirling waters. Here
the beauty of delightful hills tempts wandering mariners to refresh
themselves amidst their flowery verdure, where the winds are tempered
and fill the island and the surrounding seas with fragrant odours. Ah!
how many a ship has here been sunk. Ah! how many a vessel broken on
these rocks. Here might be seen barks without number, some wrecked and
half covered by the sand; others showing the poop and another the prow,
here a keel and there the ribs; and it seems like a day of judgment when
there should be a resurrection of dead ships, so great is the number of
them covering all the Northern shore; and while the North gale makes
various and fearful noises there.
