Perspective, in dealing with distances, makes use of two opposite
pyramids, one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as distant
as the horizon. The other has the base towards the eye and the apex on
the horizon. Now, the first includes the \[visible\] universe, embracing
all the mass of the objects that lie in front of the eye; as it might be
a vast landscape seen through a very small opening; for the more remote
the objects are from the eye, the greater number can be seen through the
opening, and thus the pyramid is constructed with the base on the
horizon and the apex in the eye, as has been said. The second pyramid is
extended to a spot which is smaller in proportion as it is farther from
the eye; and this second perspective \[= pyramid\] results from the
first.
