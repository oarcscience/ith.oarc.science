*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1211.

<span class="margnote"> On spirits (1211--1213).</span>O mathematicians
shed light on this error.

The spirit has no voice, because where there is a voice there is a body,
and where there is a body space is occupied, and this prevents the eye
from seeing what is placed behind that space; hence the surrounding air
is filled by the body, that is by its image.
