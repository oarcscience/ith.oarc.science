*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1241.

### THE CROCODILE. HYPOCRISY.

This animal catches a man and straightway kills him; after he is dead,
it weeps for him with a lamentable voice and many tears. Then, having
done lamenting, it cruelly devours him. It is thus with the hypocrite,
who, for the smallest matter, has his face bathed with tears, but shows
the heart of a tiger and rejoices in his heart at the woes of others,
while wearing a pitiful face.

### THE TOAD.

The toad flies from the light of the sun, and if it is held there by
force it puffs itself out so much as to hide its head below and shield
itself from the rays. Thus does the foe of clear and radiant virtue, who
can only be constrainedly brought to face it with puffed up courage.
