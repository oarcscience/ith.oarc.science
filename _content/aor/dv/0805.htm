Of frowning the brows, of raising the brows, of lowering the
brows,--of closing the eyes, of opening the eyes,--of raising the
nostrils, of opening the lips, with the teeth shut, of pouting with
the lips, of smiling, of astonishment.--
<P>
Describe the beginning of man when it is caused in the womb and why

sweating, fatigue, hunger, sleepiness, thirst, lust.
<P>
Of the nerve which is the cause of movement from the shoulder to the

fingers to the middle joints, and from the middle joints to the
last.
<P>
Of the nerve which causes the movement of the thigh, and from the
