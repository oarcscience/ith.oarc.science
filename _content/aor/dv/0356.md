*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 356.

Three are the principal muscles of the shoulder, that is *b c d*, and
two are the lateral muscles which move it forward and backward, that is
*a o*; *a* moves it forward, and *o* pulls it back; and bed raises it;
*a b c* moves it upwards and forwards, and *c d o* upwards and
backwards. Its own weight almost suffices to move it downwards.

The muscle *d* acts with the muscle *c* when the arm moves forward; and
in moving backward the muscle *b* acts with the muscle *c*.
