*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1557.

Πρωομιάσαι ῶ᾽ ἄνθρωπος Ἀθῆνας·

Either you say Hesperia alone, and it will mean Italy, or you add
ultima, and it will mean Spain. Umbria, part of Tuscany.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_558"></span>[466:858](1557.htm#fr_558) : AMORETTI, Mem.
Stor. XXIV, quotes the first three lines of this letter as by Leonardo.
The cha- racter of the writing however does not favour this hypothesis,
and still less the contents. I should regard it rather a rough draft of
a letter by young Melzi. I have not succeeded in deciphering completely
the 13 lines of this text. Amoretti reads at the beginning Canonica di
Vaprio, but Vaprio seems to me a very doubtful reading.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[466:859](1557.htm#fr_559) : The notes in
Greek, Nos. 1557, 1558 and 1562 stand in close connection with each
other, but the meaning of some words is very doubtful, and a translation
is thus rendered impossible.
