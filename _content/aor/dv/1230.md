*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1230.

### MAGNANIMITY.

The falcon never preys but on large birds; and it will let itself die
rather than feed on little ones, or eat stinking meat.

### VAIN GLORY.

As regards this vice, we read that the peacock is more guilty of it than
any other animal. For it is always contemplating the beauty of its tail,
which it spreads in the form of a wheel, and by its cries attracts to
itself the gaze of the creatures that surround it.

And this is the last vice to be conquered.
