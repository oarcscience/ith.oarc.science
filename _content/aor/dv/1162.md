### MORALS.

<span class="margnote"> What is life? (1162. 1163).</span>Now you see
that the hope and the desire of returning home and to one's former state
is like the moth to the light, and that the man who with constant
longing awaits with joy each new spring time, each new summer, each new
month and new year--deeming that the things he longs for are ever too
late in coming--does not perceive that he is longing for his own
destruction. But this desire is the very quintessence, the spirit of the
elements, which finding itself imprisoned with the soul is ever longing
to return from the human body to its giver. And you must know that this
same longing is that quintessence, inseparable from nature, and that man
is the image of the world.
