<P>
Old men ought to be represented with slow and heavy movements, their
legs bent at the knees, when they stand still, and their feet placed
parallel and apart; bending low with the head leaning forward, and
their arms but little extended.
<P>
Women must be represented in modest attitudes, their legs close
together, their arms closely folded, their heads inclined and
somewhat on one side.
<P>
Old women should be represented with eager, swift and furious
gestures, like infernal furies; but the action should be more
violent in their arms and head than in their legs.
<P>
Little children, with lively and contorted movements when sitting,
and, when standing still, in shy and timid attitudes.

<P><A NAME="fn_273"></A><A HREF="0583.htm#fr_273">291:271</A> : <I>bracci raccolte</I>. Compare <A HREF="pl033.htm#img_pl033">Pl. XXXIII</A>. This drawing, in
silver point on yellowish tinted paper, the lights heightened with
white, represents two female hands laid together in a lap. Above is
a third finished study of a right hand, apparently holding a veil
from the head across the bosom. This drawing evidently dates from
before 1500 and was very probably done at Florence, perhaps as a
preparatory study for some picture. The type of hand with its
slender thin forms is more like the style of the <I>Vierge aux
Rochers</I> in the Louvre than any later works--as the Mona Lisa for
instance.</P>
