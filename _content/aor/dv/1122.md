<span class="margnote"> On Flying machines (1122-1126).</span>Man when
flying must stand free from the waist upwards so as to be able to
balance himself as he does in a boat so that the centre of gravity in
himself and in the machine may counterbalance each other, and be shifted
as necessity demands for the changes of its centre of resistance.
