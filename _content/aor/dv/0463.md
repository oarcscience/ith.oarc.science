*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 463.

### OF LANDSCAPES.

The colours of the shadows in mountains at a great distance take a most
lovely blue, much purer than their illuminated portions. And from this
it follows that when the rock of a mountain is reddish the illuminated
portions are violet (?) and the more they are lighted the more they
display their proper colour.
