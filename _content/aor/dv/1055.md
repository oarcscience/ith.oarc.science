### 1055.

<span class="margnote"> Alessandria in Piedmont (1055. 1056).</span>At
Candia in Lombardy, near Alessandria della Paglia, in making a well for
Messer Gualtieri  <span id="fr_240"></span>[574](#fn_240) of Candia, the
skeleton of a very large boat was found about 10 braccia underground;
and as the timber was black and fine, it seemed good to the said Messer
Gualtieri to have the mouth of the well lengthened in such a way as that
the ends of the boat should be uncovered.
