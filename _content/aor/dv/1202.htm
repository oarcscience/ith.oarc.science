<P>
The lover is moved by the beloved object as the senses are by
sensible objects; and they unite and become one and the same thing.
The work is the first thing born of this union; if the thing loved
is base the lover becomes base.
<P>
When the thing taken into union is perfectly adapted to that which
receives it, the result is delight and pleasure and satisfaction.
<P>
When that which loves is united to the thing beloved it can rest
there; when the burden is laid down it finds rest there.
