That the sun could not be mirrored in the body of the moon, which is
a convex mirror,

<P>in such a way as that so much of its surface as is
illuminated by the sun, should reflect the sun unless the moon had a
surface adapted to reflect it--in waves and ridges, like the surface
of the sea when its surface is moved by the wind.

<P>
The waves in water multiply the image of the object reflected in it.
<P>
These waves reflect light, each by its own line, as the surface of
the fir cone does &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">471</FONT></A>

<P>
These are 2 figures one different from the other; one with
undulating water and the other with smooth water.
<P>
It is impossible that at any distance the image of the sun cast on
the surface of a spherical body should occupy the half of the
sphere.
<P>
Here you must prove that the earth produces all the same effects
with regard to the moon, as the moon with regard to the earth.
<P>
The moon, with its reflected light, does not shine like the sun,
because the light of the moon is not a continuous reflection of that
of the sun on its whole surface, but only on the crests and hollows
of the waves of its waters; and thus the sun being confusedly
reflected, from the admixture of the shadows that lie between the
lustrous waves, its light is not pure and clear as the sun is.

. The earth between the moon on the fifteenth day and the
sun. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">473</FONT></A>
 Here the sun is in the East and the moon on the
fifteenth day in the West. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">474</FONT></A>
 The moon on the fifteenth [day] between the earth
and the sun. [41]Here it is the moon which has the sun to the West
and the earth to the East.
