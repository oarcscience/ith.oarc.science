<P>
We find among Leonardo's studies several sketches for churches on
the plan of the Latin cross; we shall begin by describing them, and
shall add a few observations.

<A HREF="pl094.htm#img_pl094">Pl. XCIV</A> No. 2. (MS. B. 11b.) Plan of Santo Spirito at Florence, a
basilica built after the designs of Brunellesco.--Leonardo has added
the indication of a portico in front, either his own invention or
the reproduction of a now lost design.
<P>
<A HREF="pl095.htm#img_pl095">Pl. XCV</A> No. 2. Plan accompanied by the words: "A</I> e santo sepolcro
di milano di sopra"(A <I>is the upper church of S. Sepolcro at Milan);
although since Leonardo's time considerably spoilt, it is still the
same in plan.
<P>
The second plan with its note: "B</I> e la sua parte socto tera" (B <I>is
its subterranean part [the crypt]) still corresponds with the
present state of this part of the church as I have ascertained by
visiting the crypt with this plan. Excepting the addition of a few
insignificant walls, the state of this interesting part of the
church still conforms to Leonardo's sketch; but in the Vestibolo the
two columns near the entrance of the winding stairs are absent.
<P>

PL. XCV No. 1. Plan of a church evidently suggested by that of San
Sepolcro at Milan. The central part has been added to on the
principle of the second type of Group III. Leonardo has placed the</I>
"coro" <I>(choir) in the centre.</I>

<P><I><A HREF="pl096.htm#img_pl096">Pl. XCVI</A> No. 2. In the plan the dome, as regards its interior,
belongs to the First Class of Group IV, and may be grouped with the
one in MS. B. 35a. The nave seems to be a development of the type
represented in <A HREF="pl095.htm#img_pl095">Pl. XCV</A> No. 2, B. by adding towers and two lateral
porticos</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">378</FONT></A>
