### 380.

### OF THE HUMAN BODY IN ACTION.

<span class="margnote"> On the human body in action
(380-388).</span>When you want to represent a man as moving some weight
consider what the movements are that are to be represented by different
lines; that is to say either from below upwards, with a simple movement,
as a man does who stoops forward to take up a weight which he will lift
as he straightens himself. Or as a man does who wants to squash
something backwards, or to force it forwards or to pull it downwards
with ropes passed through pullies  <span
id="fr_190"></span>[188](#fn_190) . And here remember that the weight of
a man pulls in proportion as his centre of gravity is distant from his
fulcrum, and to this is added the force given by his legs and bent back
as he raises himself.
