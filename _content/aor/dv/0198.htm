<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> Effects on cast shadows by the tone of the back ground.</FONT></span>Modified shadows are those which are cast on light walls or other
illuminated objects.
<P>
A shadow looks darkest against a light background. The outlines of a
derived shadow will be clearer as they are nearer to the primary
shadow. A derived shadow will be most defined in shape where it is
intercepted, where the plane intercepts it at the most equal angle.
<P>
Those parts of a shadow will appear darkest which have darker
objects opposite to them. And they will appear less dark when they
face lighter objects. And the larger the light object opposite, the
more the shadow will be lightened.
<P>
And the larger the surface of the dark object the more it will
darken the derived shadow where it is intercepted.
