As to whether it is better that the water should all be raised in a
single turn or in two?
<P>
The answer is that in one single turn the wheel could not support
all the water that it can raise in two turns, because at the half
turn of the wheel it would be raising 100 pounds and no more; and if
it had to raise the whole, 200 pounds in one turn, it could not
raise them unless the wheel were of double the diameter and if the
diameter were doubled, the time of its revolution would be doubled;
therefore it is better and a greater advantage in expense to make
such a wheel of half the size (?) &amp;c
<P>
The going down of the nave of the wheel must not be so low as to
touch the surface of the water, because by touching the water its momentum
will be lessened.
<P>
And if on the contrary the conduit for the water were ten times the size of the
pipe for the water escaping from it, and if it had ten times less motion,
what would be its office? This is answered by the 9<sup>th</sup> of this which
says that the water would rise in the pipe whence it first flow, to a tenth
part of its original height.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">592</FONT></A>

of this passage arises from the circumstance that it is written on
the reverse of the sheet on which we find the text relating to
Romorantin, No. 1074.</P>
