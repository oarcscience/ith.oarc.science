*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1458.

<span class="margnote"> Notes on pupils (1458-1468.)</span>Giacomo came
to live with me on St.-Mary Magdalen's\[1\] day, 1490, aged 10 years.
The second day I had two shirts cut out for him, a pair of hose, and a
jerkin, and when I put aside some money to pay for these things he stole
4 *lire* the money out of the purse; and I could never make him confess,
though I was quite certain of the fact.--Thief, liar, obstinate,
glutton.

The day after, I went to sup with Giacomo Andrea, and the said Giacomo
supped for two and did mischief for four; for he brake 3 cruets, spilled
the wine, and after this came to sup where I....

Item: on the 7th day of September he stole a silver point of the value
of 22 soldi from Marco  <span id="fr_481"></span>[787](#fn_481) who was
living with me, 4 *lire* this being of silver; and he took it from his
studio, and when the said Marco had searched for it a long while he
found it hidden in the said Giacomo's box 4 *lire*.

<span id="page_439">p. 439</span>

Item: on the 26th January following, I, being in the house of Messer
Galeazzo da San Severino  <span id="fr_483"></span>[789](#fn_483) , was
arranging the festival for his jousting, and certain footmen having
undressed to try on some costumes of wild men for the said festival,
Giacomo went to the purse of one of them which lay on the bed with other
clothes, 2 *lire* 4 S, and took out such money as was in it.

Item: when I was in the same house, Maestro Agostino da Pavia gave to me
a Turkish hide to have 2 *lire*. a pair of short boots made of it; this
Giacomo stole it of me within a month and sold it to a cobbler for 20
soldi, with which money, by his own confession, he bought anise comfits.

Item: again, on the 2nd April, Giovan Antonio  <span
id="fr_484"></span>[790](#fn_484) having left a silver point on a
drawing of his, Giacomo stole it, and this was of the value of 24 soldi
1 *lira* 4 S.

The first year--

A cloak, 2 lire,  
6 shirts, 4 lire,  
3 jerkins, 6 lire,  
4 pairs of hose, 7 lire 8 soldi,  
1 lined doublet, 5 lire,  
24 pairs of shoes, 6 lire 5 soldi,  
A cap, l lira,  
laces, 1 lira.  <span id="fr_485"></span>[791](#fn_485)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_481"></span>[438:787](1458.htm#fr_481) 6: *Marco*, probably
Leonardo's pupil Marco d'Oggionno; 1470 is supposed to be the date of
his birth and 1540 of his death.

*Che stava con meco.* We may infer from this that he left the master
shortly after this, his term of study having perhaps expired.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[438:788](1458.htm#fr_482) : *Il di della
Maddalena.* July 22.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[439:789](1458.htm#fr_483) 9: Galeazza. See No.
718 note.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[439:790](1458.htm#fr_484) 16: Giovan Antonio,
probably Beltraffio, 1467 to 1516.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[439:791](1458.htm#fr_485) : Leonardo here
gives a detailed account not only of the loss he and others incurred
through Giacomo but of the wild tricks of the youth, and we may
therefore assume that the note was not made merely as a record for his
own use, but as a report to be forwarded to the lad's father or other
responsible guardian.
