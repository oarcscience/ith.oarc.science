### 537.

### OF THE WAY TO DRAW FIGURES FOR HISTORICAL PICTURES.

The painter must always study on the wall on which he is to picture a
story the height of the position where he wishes to arrange his figures;
and when drawing his studies for them from nature he must place himself
with his eye as much below the object he is drawing as, in the picture,
it will have to be above the eye of the spectator. Otherwise the work
will look wrong.
