### ON FOUNDATIONS, THE NATURE OF THE GROUND AND SUPPORTS.

The first and most important thing is stability.

As to the foundations of the component parts of temples and other public
buildings, the depths of the foundations must bear the same proportions
to each other as the weight of material which is to be placed upon them.

Every part of the depth of earth in a given space is composed of layers,
and each layer is composed of heavier or lighter materials, the lowest
being the heaviest. And this can be proved, because these layers have
been formed by the sediment from water carried down to the sea, by the
current of rivers which flow into it. The heaviest part of this sediment
was that which was first thrown down, and so on by degrees; and this is
the action of water when it becomes stagnant, having first brought down
the mud whence it first flowed. And such layers of soil are seen in the
banks of rivers, where their constant flow has cut through them and
divided one slope from the other to a great depth; where in gravelly
strata the waters have run off, the materials

have, in consequence, dried and been converted into hard stone, and this
happened most in what was the finest mud; whence we conclude that every
portion of the surface of the earth was once at the centre of the earth,
and *vice versa* &c
