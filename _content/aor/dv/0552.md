### OF HELPING THE APPARENT RELIEF OF A PICTURE BY GIVING IT ARTIFICIAL

### LIGHT AND SHADE.

To increase relief of a picture you may place, between your figure and
the solid object on which its shadow falls, a line of bright light,
dividing the figure from the object in shadow. And on the same object
you shall represent two light parts which will surround the shadow cast
upon the wall

by the figure placed opposite \[6\]; and do this frequently with the
limbs which you wish should stand out somewhat from the body they belong
to; particularly when the arms cross the front of the breast show,
between the shadow cast by the arms on the breast and the shadow on the
arms themselves, a little light seeming to fall through a space between
the breast and the arms; and the more you wish the arm to look detached
from the breast the broader you must make the light; always contrive
also to arrange the figures against the background in such a way as that
the parts in shadow are against a light background and the illuminated
portions against a dark background.
