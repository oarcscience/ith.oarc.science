### 1091.

<span class="margnote"> The Red Sea. (1091. 1092).</span>

For a long time the water of the Mediterranean flowed out through the
Red Sea, which is 100 miles wide and 1500 long, and full of reefs; and
it has worn away the sides of Mount Sinai, a fact which testifies, not
to an inundation from the Indian sea beating on these coasts, but to a
deluge of water which carried with it all the rivers which abound round
the Mediterranean, and besides this there is the reflux of the sea; and
then, a cutting being made to the West 3000 miles away from this place,
Gibraltar was separated from Ceuta, which had been joined to it. And
this passage was cut very low down, in the plains between Gibraltar and
the ocean at the foot of the mountain, in the low part, aided by the
hollowing out of some valleys made by certain rivers, which might have
flowed here. Hercules  <span id="fr_271"></span>[605](#fn_271) came to
open the sea to the westward and then the sea waters began to pour into
the Western Ocean; and in consequence of this great fall, the Red Sea
remained the higher; whence the water, abandoning its course here, ever
after poured away through the Straits of Spain.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_271"></span>[262:605](1091.htm#fr_271) 9: Leonardo seems
here to mention Hercules half jestingly and only in order to suggest to
the reader an allusion to the legend of the pillars of Hercules.
