### OF THE WAY TO MAKE THE SHADOW ON FIGURES CORRESPOND TO THE LIGHT AND TO \[THE COLOUR\] OF THE BODY.

When you draw a figure and you wish to see whether the shadow is the
proper complement to the light, and neither redder nor yellower than is
the nature of the colour you wish to represent in shade, proceed thus.
Cast a shadow with your finger on the illuminated portion, and if the
accidental shadow that you have made is like the natural shadow cast by
your finger on your work, well and good; and by putting your finger
nearer or farther off, you can make darker or lighter shadows, which you
must compare with your own.
