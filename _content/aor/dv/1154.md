*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1154.

Instrumental or mechanical science is of all the noblest and the most
useful, seeing that by means of this all animated bodies that have
movement perform all their actions; and these movements are based on the
centre of gravity which is placed in the middle dividing unequal
weights, and it has dearth and wealth of muscles and also lever and
counterlever.
