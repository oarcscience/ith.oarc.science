### A JEST.

A man wishing to prove, by the authority of Pythagoras, that he had
formerly been in the world, while another would not let him finish his
argument, the first speaker said to the second: "It is by this token
that I was formerly here, I remember that you were a miller." The other
one, feeling himself stung by these words, agreed that it was true, and
that by the same token he remembered that the speaker had been the ass
that carried the flour.

### A JEST.

It was asked of a painter why, since he made such beautiful figures,
which were but dead things, his children were so ugly; to which the
painter replied that he made his pictures by day, and his children by
night.
