*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1291.

### A JEST.

A man was desired to rise from bed, because the sun was already risen.
To which he replied: "If I had as far to go, and as much to do as he
has, I should be risen by now; but having but a little way to go, I
shall not rise yet."
