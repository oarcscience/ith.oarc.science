*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 483.

<span class="margnote"> The course of instruction for an artist
(483-485).</span>The youth should first learn perspective, then the
proportions of objects. Then he may copy from some good master, to
accustom himself to fine forms. Then from nature, to confirm by practice
the rules he has learnt. Then see for a time the works of various
masters. Then get the habit of putting his art into practice and work.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_234"></span>[243:232](0483.htm#fr_234) : The Vatican copy
and numerous abridgements all place this chapter at the beginning of the
*Trattato*, and in consequence DUFRESNE and all subsequent editors have
done the same. In the Vatican copy however all the general
considerations on the relation of painting to the other arts are placed
first, as introductory.
