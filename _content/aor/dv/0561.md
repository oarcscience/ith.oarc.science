### OF SHADOWS.

Where a shadow ends in the light, note carefully where it is paler or
deeper and where it is more or less indistinct towards the light; and,
above all, in \[painting\] youthful figures I remind you not to make the
shadow end like a stone, because flesh has a certain transparency, as
may be seen by looking at a hand held between the eye and the sun, which
shines through it ruddy and bright. Place the most highly coloured part
between the light and shadow. And to see what shadow tint is needed on
the flesh, cast a shadow on it with your finger, and according as you
wish to see it lighter or darker hold your finger nearer to or farther
from your picture, and copy that \[shadow\].
