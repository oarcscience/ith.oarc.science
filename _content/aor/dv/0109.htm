<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF A MIXTURE OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL PERSPECTIVE.</H3>
<P>
This diagram distinguishes natural from artificial perspective. But
before proceeding any farther I will define what is natural and what
is artificial perspective. Natural perspective says that the more
remote of a series of
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_v106400"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/v106400.jpg"></P>
<p>objects of equal size will look the smaller,
and conversely, the nearer will look the larger and the apparent
size will diminish in proportion to the distance. But in artificial
perspective when objects of unequal size are placed at various
distances, the smallest is nearer to the eye than the largest and
the greatest distance looks as though it were the least of all; and
the cause of this is the plane on which the objects are represented;
and which is at unequal distances from the eye throughout its
length. And this diminution
<P><A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A></P>
<P>of the plane is natural, but the
perspective shown upon it is artificial since it nowhere agrees with
the true diminution of the said plane. Whence it follows, that when
the eye is somewhat removed from the [station point of the]
perspective that it has been gazing at, all the objects represented
look monstrous, and this does not occur in natural perspective,
which has been defined above. Let us say then, that the square <I>a b
c d</I> figured above is foreshortened being seen by the eye situated
in the centre of the side which is in front. But a mixture of
artificial and natural perspective will be seen in this tetragon
called <I>el main</I> &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A>
, that is to say <I>e f g h</I> which must appear to the eye of
the spectator to be equal to <I>a b c d</I> so long as the eye remains in
its first position between <I>c</I> and <I>d</I>. And this will be seen to
have a good effect, because the natural perspective of the plane
will conceal the defects which would [otherwise] seem monstrous.
