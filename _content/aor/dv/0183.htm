<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> Further complications in the derived shadows (183-187).</FONT></span>The greatest depth of shadow is in the simple derived shadow because
it is not lighted by either of the two lights <I>a b, c d</I>.
<P>
The next less deep shadow is the derived shadow <I>e f n</I>; and in this
the shadow is less by half, because it is illuminated by a single
light, that is <I>c d</I>.
<P>
This is uniform in natural tone because it is lighted throughout by
one only of the two luminous bodies [10]. But it varies with the
conditions of shadow, inasmuch as the farther it is away from the
light the less it is illuminated by it [13].
<P>
The third degree of depth is the middle shadow &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">86</FONT></A>
. But this is not uniform in natural tone; because
the nearer it gets to the simple derived shadow the deeper it is
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A>
, and it is the uniformly gradual
diminution by increase of distance which is what modifies it
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A>
: that is to say the depth of a shadow
increases in proportion to the distance from the two lights.
<P>
The fourth is the shadow <I>k r s</I> and this is all the darker in
natural tone in proportion as it is nearer to <I>k s</I>, because it gets
less of the light <I>a o</I>, but by the accident [of distance] it is
rendered less deep, because it is nearer to the light <I>c d</I>, and
thus is always exposed to both lights.

<P><P>
The fifth is less deep in shadow than either of the others because
it is always entirely exposed to one of the lights and to the whole
or part of the other; and it is less deep in proportion as it is
nearer to the two lights, and in proportion as it is turned towards
the outer side <I>x t</I>; because it is more exposed to the second light
<I>a b</I>.
