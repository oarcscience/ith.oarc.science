<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ON THE SHRINKING OF DAMP BODIES OF DIFFERENT THICKNESS AND WIDTH.</H3>
<P>
The window <I>a</I> is the cause of the crack at <I>b</I>; and this crack is
increased by the pressure of <I>n</I> and <I>m</I> which sink or penetrate
into the soil in which foundations are built more than the lighter
portion at <I>b</I>. Besides, the old foundation under <I>b</I> has already
settled, and this the piers <I>n</I> and <I>m</I> have not yet done. Hence the
part <I>b</I> does not settle down perpendicularly; on the contrary, it
is thrown outwards obliquely, and it cannot on the contrary be
thrown inwards, because a portion like this, separated from the main
wall, is larger outside than inside and the main wall, where it is
broken, is of the same shape and is also larger outside than inside;
therefore, if this separate portion were to fall inwards the larger
would have to pass through the smaller--which is impossible. Hence
it is evident that the portion of the semicircular wall when
disunited from the main wall will be thrust outwards, and not
inwards as the adversary says.
<P>
When a dome or a half-dome is crushed from above by an excess of
weight the vault will give way, forming a crack which diminishes
towards the top and is wide below, narrow on the inner side and wide
outside; as is the case with the outer husk of a pomegranate,
divided into many parts lengthwise; for the more it is pressed in
the direction of its length, that part of the joints will open most,
which is most distant from the cause of the pressure; and for that
reason the arches of the vaults of any apse should never be more
loaded than the arches of the principal building. Because that which
weighs most, presses most on the parts below, and they sink into the
foundations; but this cannot happen to lighter structures like the
said apses.

Which of these two cubes will shrink the more uniformly: the cube
<I>A</I> resting on the pavement, or the cube <I>b</I> suspended in the air,
when both cubes are equal in weight and bulk, and of clay mixed with
equal quantities of water?
<P>
The cube placed on the pavement diminishes more in height than in
breadth, which the cube above, hanging in the air, cannot do. Thus
it is proved. The cube shown above is better shown here below.
<P>
The final result of the two cylinders of damp clay that is <I>a</I> and
<I>b</I> will be the pyramidal figures below <I>c</I> and <I>d</I>. This is proved
thus: The cylinder <I>a</I> resting on block of stone being made of clay
mixed with a great deal of water will sink by its weight, which
presses on its base, and in proportion as it settles and spreads all
the parts will be somewhat nearer to the base because that is
charged with the whole weight.
