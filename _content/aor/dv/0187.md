### HOW AND WHEN THE SURROUNDINGS IN SHADOW MINGLE THEIR DERIVED SHADOW WITH THE LIGHT DERIVED FROM THE LUMINOUS BODY.

The derived shadow of the dark walls on each side of the bright light of
the window are what mingle their various degrees of shade with the light
derived from the window; and these various depths of shade modify every
portion of the light, except where it is strongest, at *c*. To prove
this let *d a* be the primary shadow which is turned towards the point
*e*, and darkens it by its derived shadow; as may be seen by the
triangle △ *a e d*, in which the angle *e* faces the darkened base *d a
e*; the point *v* faces the dark shadow *a s* which is part of *a d*,
and as the whole is greater than a part, *e*

which faces the whole base \[of the triangle\], will be in deeper shadow
than *v* which only faces part of it. In consequence of the conclusion
\[shown\] in the above diagram, *t* will be less darkened than *v*,
because the base of the △ *t* is part of the base of the △ *v*; and in
the same way it follows that *p* is less in shadow than *t*, because the
base of the △ *p* is part of the base of the △ *t*. And *c* is the
terminal point of the derived shadow and the chief beginning of the
highest light.
