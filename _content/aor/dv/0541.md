### 541.

### OF DRAWING FROM RELIEF.

In drawing from the round the draughtsman should so place himself that
the eye of the figure he is drawing is on a level with his own. This
should be done with any head he may have to represent from nature
because, without exception, the figures or persons you meet in the
streets have their eyes on the same level as your own; and if you place
them higher or lower you will see that your drawing will not be true.
