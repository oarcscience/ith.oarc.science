A most important part of painting consists in the backgrounds of the
objects represented; against these backgrounds the outlines of those
natural objects which are convex are always visible, and also the forms
of these bodies against the background, even though the colours of the
bodies should be the same as that of the background. This is caused by
the convex edges of the objects not being illuminated in the same way
as, by the same light, the background is illuminated, since these edges
will often be lighter or darker than the background. But if the edge is
of the same colour as the background, beyond a doubt it will in that
part of the picture interfere with your perception of the outline, and
such a choice in a picture ought to be rejected by the judgment of good
painters, inasmuch as the purpose of the painter is to make his figures
appear detached from the background; while in the case here described
the contrary occurs, not only in the picture, but in the objects
themselves.
