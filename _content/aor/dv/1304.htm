And those who feed on grass will turn night into day (Tallow.)
<P>
And many creatures of land and water will go up among the stars (
that is Planets.)
<P>
The dead will be seen carrying the living (in Carts and Ships in
various places.)
<P>
Food shall be taken out of the mouth of many (the oven's mouth.)
<P>
And those which will have their food in their mouth will be deprived
of it by the hands of others (the oven.)
