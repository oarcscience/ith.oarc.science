### OF THE DIMINUTION IN PERSPECTIVE OF OPAQUE OBJECTS.

Among opaque objects of equal size the apparent diminution of size will
be in proportion to their distance from the eye of the spectator; but it
is an inverse proportion, since, where the distance is greater, the
opaque body will appear smaller, and the less the distance the larger
will the object appear. And this is the fundamental principle of linear
perspective and it follows:--\[11\]every object as it becomes more
remote loses first those parts which are smallest. Thus of a horse, we
should lose the legs before the head, because the legs are thinner than
the head; and the neck before the body for the same reason. Hence it
follows that the last part of the horse which would be discernible by
the eye would be the mass of the body in an oval

form, or rather in a cylindrical form and this would lose its apparent
thickness before its length--according to the 2nd rule given above, &c

If the eye remains stationary the perspective terminates in the distance
in a point. But if the eye moves in a straight \[horizontal\] line the
perspective terminates in a line and the reason is that this line is
generated by the motion of the point and our sight; therefore it follows
that as we move our sight \[eye\], the point moves, and as we move the
point, the line is generated, &c
