<span class="margnote"> Remarks on the organs of speech (832.
833).</span>The tongue is found to have 24 muscles which correspond to
the six muscles which compose the portion of the tongue which moves in
the mouth.

And when *a o u* are spoken with a clear and rapid pronunciation, it is
necessary, in order to pronounce continuously, without any pause
between, that the opening of the lips should close by degrees; that is,
they are wide apart in saying *a*, closer in saying *o*, and much closer
still to pronounce *u*.

It may be shown how all the vowels are pronounced with the farthest
portion of the false palate which is above the epiglottis.
