If any man could have discovered the
utmost powers of the cannon, in all its
various forms and have given such a secret
to the Romans, with what rapidity would
they have conquered every country and have
vanquished every army, and what reward could
have been great enough for such a service!
Archimedes indeed, although he had greatly
damaged the Romans in the siege of Syra-
cuse, nevertheless did not fail of being offered
great rewards from these very Romans; and
when Syracuse was taken, diligent search was
made for Archimedes; and he being found
dead greater lamentation was made for him
by the Senate and people of Rome than if
they had lost all their army; and they
did not fail to honour him with burial and
with a statue. At their head was Marcus
Marcellus. And after the second destruction
of Syracuse, the sepulchre of Archimedes was
found again by Cato[25], in the ruins of a
temple. So Cato had the temple restored and
the sepulchre he so highly honoured....
Whence it is written that Cato said that he
was not so proud of any thing he had done
as of having paid such honour to Archimedes.

<P><A NAME="fn_519"></A><A HREF="1476.htm#fr_519">446:819</A> : 1476. Where Leonardo found the statement that
Cato had found and restored the tomb of Archi-
medes, I do not know. It is a merit that Cicero
claims as his own (Tusc. V, 23) and certainly with
a full right to it. None of Archimedes' biographers
-not even the diligent Mazzucchelli, mentions any
version in which Cato is named. It is evidently a
slip of the memory on Leonardo's part. Besides,
according to the passage in Cicero, the grave was
not found 'nelle mine ffun tempio'-which is highly
improbable as relating to a Greek-but in an open
spot (H. MULLER-STROBING).--See too, as to Archi-
medes, No. 1417.

Leonardo says somewhere in MS. C.A.: Architronito e una macchina di fino rame, invenzlon d' Archimede (see 'Saggiol, p. 20).</P>
