That beam which is more than 20 times as long as its greatest
thickness will be of brief duration and will break in half; and

remember, that the part built into the wall should be steeped in hot
pitch and filleted with oak boards likewise so steeped. Each beam
must pass through its walls and be secured beyond the walls with
sufficient chaining, because in consequence of earthquakes the beams
are often seen to come out of the walls and bring down the walls and
floors; whilst if they are chained they will hold the walls strongly
together and the walls will hold the floors. Again I remind you
never to put plaster over timber. Since by expansion and shrinking
of the timber produced by damp and dryness such floors often crack,
and once cracked their divisions gradually produce dust and an ugly
effect. Again remember not to lay a floor on beams supported on
arches; for, in time the floor which is made on beams settles
somewhat in the middle while that part of the floor which rests on
the arches remains in its place; hence, floors laid over two kinds
of supports look, in time, as if they were made in hills &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">407</FONT></A>

19 M. RAVAISSON, in his edition of MS. A gives a very different
rendering of this passage translating it thus: <I>Les planchers qui
sont soutenus par deux differentes natures de supports paraissent
