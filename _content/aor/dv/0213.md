### Footnotes

<span id="fn_103"></span>[118:101](0213.htm#fr_103) : In this and the
following chapters of MS. C the order of the original paging has been
adhered to, and is shown in parenthesis. Leonardo himself has but rarely
worked out the subject of these propositions. The space left for the
purpose has occasionally been made use of for quite different matter.
Even the numerous diagrams, most of them very delicately sketched,
lettered and numbered, which occur on these pages, are hardly ever
explained, with the exception of those few which are here given.
