### 462.

### OF PAINTING IN A LANDSCAPE.

If the slope of a hill comes between the eye and the horizon, sloping
towards the eye, while the eye is opposite the middle of the height of
this slope, then that hill will

increase in darkness throughout its length. This is proved by the 7th of
this which says that a tree looks darkest when it is seen from below;
the proposition is verified, since this hill will, on its upper half
show all its trees as much from the side which is lighted by the light
of the sky, as from that which is in shade from the darkness of the
earth; whence it must result that these trees are of a medium darkness.
And from this \[middle\] spot towards the base of the hill, these trees
will be lighter by degrees by the converse of the 7th and by the said
7th: For trees so placed, the nearer they are to the summit of the hill
the darker they necessarily become. But this darkness is not in
proportion to the distance, by the 8th of this which says: That object
shows darkest which is \[seen\] in the clearest atmosphere; and by the
10th: That shows darkest which stands out against a lighter background.
