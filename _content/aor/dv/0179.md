### 179.

### THE ACTION OF THE LIGHT AS FROM ITS CENTRE.

If it were the whole of the light that caused the shadows beyond the
bodies placed in front of it, it would follow that any body much smaller
than the light would cast a pyramidal shadow; but experience not showing
this, it must be the centre of the light that produces this effect.

### PROOF.

Let *a b* be the width of the light from a window, which falls on a
stick set up at one foot from *a c*  <span
id="fr_86"></span>[84](#fn_86) . And let *a d* be the space where all
the light from the window is visible. At *c e* that part of the window
which is between *l b* cannot be seen. In the same way *a m* cannot be
seen from *d f* and therefore in these two portions the light begins to
fail.

Shadow as produced by two lights of different size (180. 181).
