*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 583.

Old men ought to be represented with slow and heavy movements, their
legs bent at the knees, when they stand still, and their feet placed
parallel and apart; bending low with the head leaning forward, and their
arms but little extended.

Women must be represented in modest attitudes, their legs close
together, their arms closely folded, their heads inclined and somewhat
on one side.

Old women should be represented with eager, swift and furious gestures,
like infernal furies; but the action should be more violent in their
arms and head than in their legs.

Little children, with lively and contorted movements when sitting, and,
when standing still, in shy and timid attitudes.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[291:271](0583.htm#fr_273) : *bracci raccolte*.
Compare [Pl. XXXIII](pl033.htm#img_pl033). This drawing, in silver point
on yellowish tinted paper, the lights heightened with white, represents
two female hands laid together in a lap. Above is a third finished study
of a right hand, apparently holding a veil from the head across the
bosom. This drawing evidently dates from before 1500 and was very
probably done at Florence, perhaps as a preparatory study for some
picture. The type of hand with its slender thin forms is more like the
style of the *Vierge aux Rochers* in the Louvre than any later works--as
the Mona Lisa for instance.
