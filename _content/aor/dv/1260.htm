<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.</H3>
<P>
This beast when it feels itself over-full goes about seeking thorns,
or where there may be the remains of canes that have been

<P>split, and it rubs against them till a vein is opened; then when the blood has
flowed as much as he needs, he plasters himself with mud and heals
the wound. In form he is something like a horse with long haunches,
a twisted tail and the teeth of a wild boar, his neck has a mane;
the skin cannot be pierced, unless when he is bathing; he feeds on
plants in the fields and goes into them backwards so that it may
seem, as though he had come out.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE IBIS.</H3>
<P>
This bird resembles a crane, and when it feels itself ill it fills
its craw with water, and with its beak makes an injection of it.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE STAG.</H3>
<P>
These creatures when they feel themselves bitten by the spider
called father-long-legs, eat crabs and free themselves of the venom.
