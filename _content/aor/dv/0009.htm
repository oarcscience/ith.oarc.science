<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> General introductions to the book on Painting (9-13).</FONT></span>Seeing that I can find no subject specially useful or
pleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their
own every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being
poor, comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing
himself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers,
and not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then,
will load my humble pack with this despised and rejected
merchandise, the refuse of so many buyers; and will go about to
distribute it, not indeed in great cities, but in the poorer towns,
taking such a price as the wares I offer may be worth. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>

<P><A NAME="fn_8"></A><A HREF="0009.htm#fr_8">13:6</A> : It
need hardly be pointed out that there is in this 'Proemio' a covert
irony. In the second and third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his
rivals and opponents more closely. His protest is directed against
Neo-latinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time; its
futility is now no longer questioned.</P>
