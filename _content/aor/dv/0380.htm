<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> On the human body in action (380-388).</FONT></span>When you want to represent a man as moving some weight consider what
the movements are that are to be represented by different lines;
that is to say either from below upwards, with a simple movement, as
a man does who stoops forward to take up a weight which he will lift
as he straightens himself. Or as a man does who wants to squash
something backwards, or to force it forwards or to pull it downwards
with ropes passed through pullies &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">188</FONT></A>
. And here remember that
the weight of a man pulls in proportion as his centre of gravity is
distant from his fulcrum, and to this is added the force given by
his legs and bent back as he raises himself.
