### 160.

### SHADOW AND LIGHT.

<span class="margnote"> Different sorts of derived shadows
(160-162).</span>The forms of shadows are three: inasmuch as if the
solid body which casts the shadow is equal (in size) to the light, the
shadow resembles

<span id="img_v109200"></span> ![](img/v109200.jpg)

a column without any termination (in length). If the body is larger than
the light the shadow resembles a truncated and inverted pyramid, and its
length has also no defined termination. But if the body is smaller than
the light, the shadow will resemble a pyramid and come to an end, as is
seen in eclipses of the moon.
