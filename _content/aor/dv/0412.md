### 412.

### OF THE INSERTION OF THE BRANCHES ON PLANTS.

<span class="margnote"> The insertion of the leaves (412--419).</span>

Such as the growth of the ramification of plants is on their principal
branches, so is that of the leaves on the shoots of the same plant.
These leaves have  <span id="fr_209"></span>[207](#fn_209) four modes of
growing one above another. The first, which is the most general, is that
the sixth always originates over the sixth below  <span
id="fr_210"></span>[208](#fn_210) ; the second is that two third ones
above are over the two third ones below  <span
id="fr_211"></span>[209](#fn_211) ; and the third way is that the third
above is over the third below  <span id="fr_212"></span>[210](#fn_212) .

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_209"></span>[211:207](0412.htm#fr_209) 6: *Quattro modi*
(four modes). Only three are described in the text, the fourth is only
suggested by a sketch.

This passage occurs in MANZI'S edition of the Trattato, p. 399, but
without the sketches and the text is mutilated in an important part. The
whole passage has been commented on, from MANZI'S version, in Part I of
the *Nuovo Giornale Botanico Italiano*, by Prof. G. UZIELLI (Florence
1869, Vol. I). He remarks as to the 'four modes': "*Leonardo, come si
vede nelle linie sententi da solo tre esempli. Questa ed altre
inessattezze fanno desiderare, sia esaminato di nuovo il manoscritto
Vaticano*". This has since been done by D. KNAPP of Tubingen, and his
accurate copy has been published by H. LUDWIG, the painter. The passage
in question occurs in his edition as No. 833; and there also the
drawings are wanting. The space for them has been left vacant, but in
the Vatican copy '*niente*' has been written on the margin; and in it,
as well as in LUDWIG'S and MANZI'S edition, the text is mutilated.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[211:208](0412.htm#fr_210) 8: *la sesta di
sotto. "Disposizione 2/5 o 1/5. Leonardo osservo probabilmente soltanto
la prima"* (UZIELLl).

<span id="fn_211"></span>[211:209](0412.htm#fr_211) 10: *terze di sotto:
"Intende qui senza dubbio parlare di foglie decussate, in cui il terzo
verticello e nel piano del primo"* (UZIELLI).

<span id="fn_212"></span>[211:210](0412.htm#fr_212) 11: 3a *di sotto:
"Disposizione 1/2"* (UZIELLI).

<span id="fn_213"></span>[211:211](0412.htm#fr_213) : See the four
sketches on the upper portion of the page reproduced as fig. 2 on [Pl.
XXVII](pl027.htm#img_pl027).
