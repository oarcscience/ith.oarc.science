*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1163.

O Time! consumer of all things; O envious age! thou dost destroy all
things and devour all things with the relentless teeth of years, little

the withered wrinkles made in her face by old age, wept and wondered why
she had twice been carried away.

O Time! consumer of all things, and O envious age! by which all things
are all devoured.
