*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1310.

(Of Grain and other Seeds.)

Men will fling out of their houses those victuals which were intended to
sustain their life.

(Of Trees, which nourish grafted shoots.)

Fathers and mothers will be seen to take much more delight in their
step-children then in their own children.

(Of the Censer.)

Some will go about in white garments with arrogant gestures threatening
others with metal and fire which will do no harm at all to them.
