<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO DRAW WITH COMPANIONS OR NOT.</H3>
<P>
<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> The distribution of time for studying (495-497).</FONT></span>I say and insist that drawing in company is much better than alone,
for many reasons. The first is that you would be ashamed to be seen
behindhand among the students, and such shame will lead you to
careful study. Secondly, a wholesome emulation will stimulate you to
be among those who are more praised than yourself, and this praise
of others will spur you on. Another is that you can learn from the
drawings of others who do better than yourself; and if you are
better than they, you can profit by your contempt for their defects,
while the praise of others will incite you to farther merits.

<P><A NAME="fn_242"></A><A HREF="0495.htm#fr_242">249:240</A> : The contradiction by this passage of the foregoing
chapter is only apparent. It is quite clear, from the nature of the
reasoning which is here used to prove that it is more improving to
work with others than to work alone, that the studies of pupils only
are under consideration here.</P>
