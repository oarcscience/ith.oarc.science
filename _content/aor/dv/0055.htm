All objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids, and the
nearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller

<p>will the image appear of the objects which cause them. Therefore, you may
intersect the pyramid with a vertical plane &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A>
 which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown
in the plane <I>a n</I>.

The eye <I>f</I> and the eye <I>t</I> are one and the same thing; but the eye
<I>f</I> marks the distance, that is to say how far you are standing from
the object; and the eye <I>t</I> shows you the direction of it; that is
whether you are opposite, or on one side, or at an angle to the
object you are looking at. And remember that the eye <I>f</I> and the eye
<I>t</I> must always be kept on the same level. For example if you raise
or lower the eye from the distance point <I>f</I> you must do the same
with the direction point <I>t</I>. And if the point <I>f</I> shows how far the
eye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which
<P><A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A></P>
<P>side it is placed--and, if in the same way, the point <I>t</I> show <I>s</I> the
direction and not the distance, in order to ascertain both you must
use both points and they will be one and the same thing. If the eye
<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> The relations of the distance points to the vanishing point (55-56).</FONT></span><I>f</I> could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to
the distance between <I>s</I> and <I>c</I>, and if at the nearest end of the
side towards the eye a pole were placed, or some other straight
object, set up by a perpendicular line as shown at <I>r s</I>--then, I
say, that if you were to look at the side of the square that is
nearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane <I>r
s</I>, and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at
the height of the point <I>n</I> on the vertical plane. Thus, by this
example, you can understand that if the eye is above a number of
objects all placed on the same level, one beyond another, the more
remote they are the higher they will seem, up to the level of the
eye, but no higher; because objects placed upon the level on which
your feet stand, so long as it is flat--even if it be extended into
infinity--would never be seen above the eye; since the eye has in
itself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which
convey the images of the objects to the eye. And this point always
coincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all
we can see. And from the base line of the first pyramid as far as
the diminishing point

Compare the definitions in 85, 2-5, 6-27. These lines refer
exclusively to the third diagram. For the better understanding of
this it should be observed that <I>c s</I> must be regarded as
representing the section or profile of a square plane, placed
horizontally (comp. lines 11, 14, 17) for which the word <I>pianura</I>
is subsequently employed (20, 22). Lines 6-13 contain certain
preliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the
diagram; the last three seem to have been added as a supplement.
Leonardo's mistake in writing <I>t denota</I> (line 6) for <I>f denota</I> has
been rectified.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_32"></A><A HREF="0055.htm#fr_32">35:30</A> : The two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the
first five lines. They have, however, more letters than are referred
to in the text, a circumstance we frequently find occasion to
remark.</P>
