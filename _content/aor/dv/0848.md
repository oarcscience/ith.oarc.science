### 848.

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

Death in old men, when not from fever, is caused by the veins which go
from the spleen to the valve of the liver, and which thicken so much in
the walls that they become closed up and leave no passage for the blood
that nourishes it.

<span class="margnote"> On the circulation of the blood
(848-850).</span>\[6\]The incessant current of the blood through the
veins makes these veins thicken and become callous, so that at last they
close up and prevent the passage of the blood.
