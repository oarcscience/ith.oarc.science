### Footnotes

<span id="fn_398"></span>[417:704](1377.htm#fr_398) : Giuliano de
Medici, brother to Pope Leo X.; see note to Nos. 1351-1353. In February,
1515, he was married to Filiberta, daughter of Filippo, Duke of Savoy,
and aunt to Francis I, Louis XII's successor on the throne of France.
Louis XII died on Jan. 1st, and not on Jan. 9th as is here stated.--
This addition is written in paler ink and evidently at a later date.
