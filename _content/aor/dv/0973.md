When the fulness of rivers is diminished, then the acute angles formed
at the junction of their branches become shorter at the sides and wider
at the point; like the current *a n* and the current *d n*, which unite
in *n* when the river is at its greatest fulness. I say, that when it is
in this condition if, before the fullest time, *d n* was lower than *a
n*, at the time of fulness *d n* will be full of sand and mud. When the
water *d n* falls, it will carry away the mud and remain with a lower
bottom, and the channel *a n* finding itself the higher, will fling its
waters into the lower, *d n*, and will wash away all the point of the
sand-spit *b n c*, and thus the angle *a c d* will remain larger than
the angle *a n d* and the sides shorter, as I said before.
