### 331.

*m n o* are equal. The narrowest width of the leg seen in front goes 8
times from the sole of the foot to the joint of the knee, and is the
same width as the arm, seen in front at the wrist, and as the longest
measure of the ear, and as the three chief divisions into which we
divide the face; and this measurement goes 4 times from the wrist joint
of the hand to the point of the elbow. \[14\] The foot is as long as the
space from the knee between *a* and *b*; and the patella of the knee is
as long as the leg between *r* and *s*.

\[18\] The least thickness of the leg in profile goes 6 times from the
sole of the foot

to the knee joint and is the same width as the space between the outer
corner of the eye and the opening of the ear, and as the thickest part
of the arm seen in profile and between the inner corner of the eye and
the insertion of the hair.

*a b c* \[*d*\] are all relatively of equal length, *c d* goes twice
from the sole of the foot to the centre of the knee and the same from
the knee to the hip.

\[28\]*a b c* are equal; *a* to *b* is 2 feet--that is to say measuring
from the heel to the tip of the great toe.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_155"></span>[179:153](0331.htm#fr_155) : See [Pl.
XV](pl015.htm#img_pl015). The text of lines 2-17 is to the left of the
front view of the leg, to which it refers. Lines 18-27 are in the middle
column and refer to the leg seen in profile and turned to the left, on
the right hand side of the writing. Lines 20-30 are above, to the left
and apply to the sketch below them.

Some farther remarks on the proportion of the leg will be found in No.
336, lines 6, 7.
