<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">LIES.</H3>
<P>
The mole has very small eyes and it always lives under ground; and
it lives as long as it is in the dark but when it comes into the
light it dies immediately, because it becomes known;--and so it is
with lies.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">VALOUR.</H3>
<P>
The lion is never afraid, but rather fights with a bold spirit and
savage onslaught against a multitude of hunters, always seeking to
injure the first that injures him.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">FEAR OR COWARDICE.</H3>
<P>
The hare is always frightened; and the leaves that fall from the
trees in autumn always keep him in terror and generally put him to
flight.
