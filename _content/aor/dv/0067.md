*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 67.

<span class="margnote"> General conclusions.</span>All objects project
their whole image and likeness, diffused and mingled in the whole of the
atmosphere, opposite to themselves. The image of every point of the
bodily surface, exists in every part of the atmosphere. All the images
of the objects are

in every part of the atmosphere. The whole, and each part of the image
of the atmosphere is \[reflected\] in each point of the surface of the
bodies presented to it. Therefore both the part and the whole of the
images of the objects exist, both in the whole and in the parts of the
surface of these visible bodies. Whence we may evidently say that the
image of each object exists, as a whole and in every part, in each part
and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body. As is seen in
two mirrors placed opposite to each other.
