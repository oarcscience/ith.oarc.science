*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1231.

### CONSTANCY.

Constancy may be symbolised by the phoenix which, knowing that by nature
it must be resuscitated, has the constancy to endure the burning flames
which consume it, and then it rises anew.

### INCONSTANCY.

The swallow may serve for Inconstancy, for it is always in movement,
since it cannot endure the smallest discomfort.

### CONTINENCE.

The camel is the most lustful animal there is, and will follow the
female for a thousand miles. But if you keep it constantly with its
mother or sister it will leave them alone, so temperate is its nature.
