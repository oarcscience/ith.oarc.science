### TO RESTORE OIL COLOURS THAT HAVE BECOME DRY.

If you want to restore oil colours that have become dry keep them
soaking in soft soap for a night and, with your finger, mix them up with
the soft soap; then pour them into a cup and wash them with water, and
in this way you can restore colours that have got dry. But take care
that each colour has its own vessel to itself adding the colour by
degrees as you restore it and mind that they are thoroughly softened,
and when you wish to use them for tempera wash them five and six times
with spring water, and leave them to settle; if the soft soap should be
thick with any of the colours pass it through a filter.  <span
