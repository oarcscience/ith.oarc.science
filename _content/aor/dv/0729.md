### 729.

### STUCCO.

<span class="margnote"> On stucco (729. 730).</span>Place stucco over
the prominence of the..... which may be composed of Venus and Mercury,
and lay it well over that prominence of the thickness of the side of a
knife, made with the ruler and cover this with the bell of a still, and
you will have again the moisture with which you applied the paste. The
rest you may dry  <span id="fr_17"></span>[351](#fn_17)

well; afterwards fire it, and beat it or burnish it with a good
burnisher, and make it thick towards the side.

### STUCCO.

Powder ... with borax and water to a paste, and make stucco of it, and
then heat it so that it may dry, and then varnish it, with fire, so that
it shines well.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_17"></span>[19:351](0729.htm#fr_17) : In this passage a few
words have been written in a sort of cipher--that is to say backwards;
as in l. 3 *erenev* for *Venere*, l. 4 *oirucrem* for Mercurio, l. 12
*il orreve co ecarob* for *il everro (?) co borace*. The meaning of the
word before *"di giesso"* in l. 1 is unknown; and the sense, in which
*sagoma* is used here and in other passages is obscure.-- *Venere* and
*Mercurio* may mean 'marble' and 'lime', of which stucco is composed.

12\. The meaning of *orreve* is unknown.
