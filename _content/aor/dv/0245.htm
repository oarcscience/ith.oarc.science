If you look at a body of which the illuminated portion lies and ends
against a dark background, that part of the light which will look
brightest will be that which lies against the dark [background] at
<I>d</I>. But if this brighter part lies against a light background, the
edge of the object, which is itself light, will be less distinct
than before, and the highest light will appear to be between the
limit of the background <I>m f</I> and the shadow. The same thing is seen
with regard to the dark [side],

<P>inasmuch as that edge of the shaded
portion of the object which lies against a light background, as at
<I>l</I>, it looks much darker than the rest. But if this shadow lies
against a dark background, the edge of the shaded part will appear
lighter than before, and the deepest shade will appear between the
edge and the light at the point <I>o</I>.
