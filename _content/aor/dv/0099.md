### 99.

### OF LINEAR PERSPECTIVE.

<span class="margnote"> The apparent size of objects defined by
calculation (99-105)</span>Linear Perspective deals with the action of
the lines of sight, in proving by measurement how much smaller is a
second object than the first, and how much the third is smaller than the
second; and so on by degrees to the end of things visible. I find by
experience that if a second object is as far beyond the first as the
first is from the eye, although they are of the same size, the second
will seem half the size of the first and if the third object is of the
same size as the 2nd, and the 3rd is as far beyond the second as the 2nd
from the first, it will appear of half the size of the second; and so on
by degrees, at equal distances, the next farthest will be half the size
of the former object. So long as the space does not exceed the length of
20 braccia. But, beyond 20 braccia figures of equal size will lose 2/4
and at 40 braccia they will lose 9/10, and 19/20 at 60 braccia, and so
on diminishing by degrees. This is if the picture plane is distant from
you twice your own height. If it is only as far off as your own height,
there will be a great difference between the first braccia and the
second.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_50"></span>[59:48](0099.htm#fr_50) : This chapter is
included in DUFRESNE'S and MANZI'S editions of the Treatise on Painting.
H. LUDWIG, in his commentary, calls this chapter "*eines der wichtigsten
im ganzen Tractat*", but at the same time he asserts that its substance
has been so completely disfigured in the best MS. copies that we ought
not to regard Leonardo as responsible for it. However, in the case of
this chapter, the old MS. copies agree with the original as it is
reproduced above. From the chapters given later in this edition, which
were written at a subsequent date, it would appear that Leonardo
corrected himself on these points.
