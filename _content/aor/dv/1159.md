*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1159.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

Any one who in discussion relies upon authority uses, not his
understanding, but rather his memory. Good culture is born of a good
disposition; and since the cause is more to be praised than the effect,
I will rather praise a good disposition without culture, than good
culture without the disposition.
