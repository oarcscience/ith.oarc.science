*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1200.

Just as courage imperils life, fear protects it.

Threats alone are the weapons of the threatened man.

Wherever good fortune enters, envy lays siege to the place and attacks
it; and when it departs, sorrow and repentance remain behind.

He who walks straight rarely falls.

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

It is bad if you praise, and worse if you reprove a thing, I mean, if
you do not understand the matter well.

It is ill to praise, and worse to reprimand in matters that you do not
understand.
