<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> Doubts about the deluge.</FONT></span>Here a doubt arises, and that is: whether the deluge, which happened
at the time of Noah, was universal or not. And it would
<P><A NAME="page_209"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 209</FONT></A></P>
<P>seem not, for the reasons now to be given: We have it in the Bible that this
deluge lasted 40 days and 40 nights of incessant and universal rain,
and that this rain rose to ten cubits above the highest mountains in
the world. And if it had been that the rain was universal, it would
have covered our globe which is spherical in form. And this
spherical surface is equally distant in every part, from the centre
of its sphere; hence the sphere of the waters being under the same
conditions, it is impossible that the water upon it should move,
because water, in itself, does not move unless it falls; therefore
how could the waters of such a deluge depart, if it is proved that
it has no motion? and if it departed how could it move unless it
went upwards? Here, then, natural reasons are wanting; hence to
remove this doubt it is necessary to call in a miracle to aid us, or
else to say that all this water was evaporated by the heat of the
sun.

<P><A NAME="fn_186"></A><A HREF="0986.htm#fr_186">209:520</A> : The passages, here given from the MS. Leic., have
hitherto remained unknown. Some preliminary notes on the subject are
to be found in MS. F 80<sup>a</sup> and 80<sup>b</sup>; but as compared with the fuller
treatment here given, they are, it seems to me, of secondary
interest. They contain nothing that is not repeated here more
clearly and fully. LIBRI, <I>Histoire des Sciences mathematiques III</I>,
pages 218--221, has printed the text of F 80<sup>a</sup> and 80<sup>b</sup>, therefore it
seemed desirable to give my reasons for not inserting it in this
work.</P>
