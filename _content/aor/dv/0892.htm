<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> On the luminousity of the moon (892-901).</FONT></span>As I propose to treat of the nature of the moon, it is necessary
that first I should describe the perspective of mirrors, whether
plane, concave or convex; and first what is meant by a luminous ray,
and how it is refracted by various kinds of media; then, when a
reflected ray is most powerful, whether
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_v215400"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/v215400.jpg"></P>
when the angle of incidence
is acute, right, or obtuse, or from a convex, a plane, or a concave
surface; or from an opaque or a transparent body. Besides this, how
it is that the solar rays which fall on the waves of the sea, are
seen by the eye of the same
<P><A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A></P>
<P>width at the angle nearest to the eye,
as at the highest line of the waves on the horizon; but
notwithstanding this the solar rays reflected from the waves of the
sea assume the pyramidal form and consequently, at each degree of
distance increase proportionally in size, although to our sight,
they appear as parallel.
<P>
1<sup>st</sup>. Nothing that has very little weight is opaque.
<P>
2<sup>dly</sup>. Nothing that is excessively weighty can remain beneath that
which is heavier.
<P>
3<sup>dly</sup>. As to whether the moon is situated in the centre of its
elements or not.
<P>
And, if it has no proper place of its own, like the earth, in the
midst of its elements, why does it not fall to the centre of our
elements? &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">465</FONT></A>

<P>
And, if the moon is not in the centre of its own elements and yet
does not fall, it must then be lighter than any other element.
<P>
And, if the moon is lighter than the other elements why is it opaque
and not transparent?
<P>
When objects of various sizes, being placed at various distances,
look of equal size, there must be the same relative proportion in
the distances as in the magnitudes of the objects.
