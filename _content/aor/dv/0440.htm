In the position of the eye which sees that portion of a tree
illuminated which turns towards the light, one tree will never be
seen to be illuminated equally with the other. To prove this, let
the eye be <I>c</I> which sees

the two trees <I>b d</I> which are illuminated
by the sun <I>a</I>; I say that this eye <I>c</I> will not see the light in
the same proportion to the shade, in one tree as in the other.
Because, the tree which is nearest to the sun will display so much
the stronger shadow than the more distant one, in proportion as one
tree is nearer to the rays of the sun that converge to the eye than
the other; &amp;c
<P>
You see that the eye <I>c</I> sees nothing of the tree <I>d</I> but shadow,
while the same eye <I>c</I> sees th&egrave; tree <I>b</I> half in light and half in
shade.
<P>
When a tree is seen from below, the eye sees the top of it as placed
within the circle made by its boughs[23].
<P>
Remember, O Painter! that the variety of depth of shade in any one
particular species of tree is in proportion to the rarity or density
of their branches.
