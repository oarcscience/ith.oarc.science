<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">TO DRAW A FIGURE ON A WALL 12 BRACCIA HIGH WHICH SHALL LOOK 24 BRACCIA HIGH.</H3>
<P>
If you wish to draw a figure or any other object to look 24 braccia
high you must do it in this way. First, on the surface <I>m r</I> draw
half the man you wish to represent; then the other half; then put on
the vault <I>m n</I> [the rest of] the figure spoken of above; first set
out the vertical plane on the floor of a room of the same shape as
the wall with the coved part on which you are to paint your figure.
Then, behind it, draw a figure set out in profile of whatever size
you please, and draw lines from it to the point <I>f</I> and, as these
lines cut <I>m n</I> on the vertical plane, so will the figure come on
the wall, of which the vertical plane gives a likeness, and you will
have all the [relative] heights and prominences of the figure. And
the breadth or thickness which are on the upright wall <I>m n</I> are to
be drawn in their proper form, since, as the wall recedes the figure
will be foreshortened by itself; but [that part of] the figure which
goes into the cove you must foreshorten, as if it were standing
upright; this diminution you must set out on a flat floor and there
must stand the figure which is to be transferred from the vertical
plane <I>r n</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">251</FONT></A>
 in its real
size and reduce it once more on a vertical plane; and this will be a
good method &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_254"></A><A HREF="#fn_254"><FONT SIZE="1">252</FONT></A>

<P><A NAME="fn_254"></A><A HREF="0526.htm#fr_254">263:252</A>  18: Leonardo here says nothing as to how the
image foreshortened by perspective and thus produced on the vertical
plane is to be transferred to the wall; but from what is said in
Nos. 525 and 523 we may conclude that he was familiar with the
process of casting the enlarged shadow of a squaring net on the
surface of a wall to guide him in drawing the figure.
<P>
<I>Pariete di rilieuo; "sur une parai en relief"</I> (RAVAISSON). <I>"Auf
einer Schnittlinie zum Aufrichten"</I> (LUDWIG). The explanation of
this puzzling expression must be sought in No. 545, lines 15-17.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_255"></A><A HREF="0526.htm#fr_255">263:253</A> : See <A HREF="pl031.htm#img_pl031">Pl. XXXI</A>. 3. The second sketch, which in the plate is
incomplete, is here reproduced and completed from the original to
illustrate the text. In the original the larger diagram is placed
between lines 5 and 6.
<P>
1. 2. C. A. 157a; 463a has the similar heading: '<I>del cressciere
della figura</I>', and the text begins: "<I>Se voli fare 1a figura
grande</I> b c" but here it breaks off. The translation here given
renders the meaning of the passage as I think it must be understood.
The MS. is perfectly legible and the construction of the sentence is
simple and clear; difficulties can only arise from the very fullness
of the meaning, particularly towards the end of the passage.</P>
