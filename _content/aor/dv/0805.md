### 805.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

Which nerve causes the motion of the eye so that the motion of one eye
moves the other?

Of frowning the brows, of raising the brows, of lowering the brows,--of
closing the eyes, of opening the eyes,--of raising the nostrils, of
opening the lips, with the teeth shut, of pouting with the lips, of
smiling, of astonishment.--

Describe the beginning of man when it is caused in the womb and why an
eight months child does not live. What sneezing is. What yawning is.
Falling sickness, spasms, paralysis, shivering with cold, sweating,
fatigue, hunger, sleepiness, thirst, lust.

Of the nerve which is the cause of movement from the shoulder to the
elbow, of the movement from the elbow to the hand, from the joint of the
hand to the springing of the fingers. From the springing of the fingers
to the middle joints, and from the middle joints to the last.

Of the nerve which causes the movement of the thigh, and from the knee
to the foot, and from the joint of the foot to the toes, and then to the
middle of the toes and of the rotary motion of the leg.
