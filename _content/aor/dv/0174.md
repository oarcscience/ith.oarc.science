You will find that the proportion of the diameter of the derived shadow
to that of the primary shadow will be the same as that between the
darkness of the primary shadow and that of the derived shadow.

 <span id="fr_80"></span>[78](#fn_80) Let *a b* be the diameter of the
primary shadow and *c d* that of the derived shadow, I say that *a b*
going, as you see, three times into *d c*, the shadow *d c* will be
three times as light as the shadow *a b*.  <span

the illuminated body an intersection of shadow will occur, beyond which
the shadows will run off in two opposite directions as if they were
caused by two separate lights.
