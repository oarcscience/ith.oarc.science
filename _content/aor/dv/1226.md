*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1226.

### FLATTERERS OR SYRENS.

The syren sings so sweetly that she lulls the mariners to sleep; then
she climbs upon the ships and kills the sleeping mariners.

### PRUDENCE.

The ant, by her natural foresight provides in the summer for the winter,
killing the seeds she harvests that they may not germinate, and on them,
in due time she feeds.

### FOLLY.

The wild bull having a horror of a red colour, the hunters dress up the
trunk of a tree with red and the bull runs at this with great frenzy,
thus fixing his horns, and forthwith the hunters kill him there.
