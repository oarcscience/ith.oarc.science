<span class="margnote"> Observations in support of the hypothesis
(963-969).</span>

The waters circulate with constant motion from the utmost depths of the
sea to the highest summits of the mountains, not obeying the nature of
heavy matter; and in this case it acts as does the blood of animals
which is always moving from the sea of the heart and flows to the top of
their heads; and here it is that veins burst--as one may see when a vein
bursts in the nose, that all the blood

from below rises to the level of the burst vein. When the water rushes
out of a burst vein in the earth it obeys the nature of other things
heavier than the air, whence it always seeks the lowest places. \[7\]
These waters traverse the body of the earth with infinite ramifications.
