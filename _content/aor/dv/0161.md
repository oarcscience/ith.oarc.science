and two kinds which are undefined; and the defined shadow is pyramidal.
Of the two undefined, one is a column and the other spreads out; and all

pyramidal, shadow proceeds from a body that is smaller than the light,
and the columnar from a body equal in size to the light, and the
spreading shadow from a body larger than the light; &c
