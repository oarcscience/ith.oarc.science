*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 864.

Mem.: That I must first show the distance of the sun from the earth;
and, by means of a ray passing through a small hole into a dark chamber,
detect its real size; and besides this, by means of the aqueous sphere
calculate the size of the globe ...

Here it will be shown, that when the sun is in the meridian of our
hemisphere  <span id="fr_110"></span>[444](#fn_110) , the antipodes to
the East and to the West, alike, and at the same time, see the sun
mirrored in their waters; and the same is equally true of the arctic and
antarctic poles, if indeed they are inhabited.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_110"></span>[139:444](0864.htm#fr_110) 10: *Antipodi
orientali cogli occidentali*. The word *Antipodes* does not here bear
its literal sense, but--as we may infer from the simultaneous reference
to inhabitants of the North and South-- is used as meaning men living at
a distance of 90 degrees from the zenith of the rational horizon of each
observer.
