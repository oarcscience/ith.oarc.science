near together. The topmost part of the first will be in great part
transparent and light, and will stand out against the dark portion of
the second tree. And thus it will be with all in succession that are

in great part transparent and lighted by the light *s* which falls upon
it from the opposite side, and it will see it, on a dark ground *b c*

background *n g*.

you is the darkest.
