<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">A COMMON THING.</H3>
<P>
A wretched person will be flattered, and these flatterers are always
the deceivers, robbers and murderers of the wretched person.
<P>
The image of the sun where it falls appears as a thing which covers
the person who attempts to cover it.
<P>
(Money and Gold.)
<P>
Out of cavernous pits a thing shall come forth which will make all
the nations of the world toil and sweat with the greatest torments,
anxiety and labour, that they may gain its aid.
<P>
(Of the Dread of Poverty.)
<P>
The malicious and terrible [monster] will cause so much terror of
itself in men that they will rush together, with a rapid motion,
like madmen, thinking they are escaping her boundless force.
<P>
(Of Advice.)
<P>
The man who may be most necessary to him who needs him, will be
repaid with ingratitude, that is greatly contemned.
