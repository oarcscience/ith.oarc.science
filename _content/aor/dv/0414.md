*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 414.

In the walnut tree the leaves which are distributed on the shoots of
this year are further apart from each other and more numerous in
proportion as the branch from which this shoot springs is a young one.
And they are inserted more closely and less in number when the shoot
that bears them springs from an old branch. Its fruits are borne at the
ends of the shoots. And its largest boughs are the lowest on the boughs
they spring from. And this arises from the weight of its sap which is
more apt to descend than to rise, and consequently the branches which
spring from them and rise towards the sky are small and slender \[20\];
and when the shoot turns towards the sky its leaves spread out from it
\[at an angle\] with an equal distribution of their tips; and if the
shoot turns to the horizon the leaves lie flat; and this arises from the
fact that leaves without exception, turn their underside to the earth
\[29\].

The shoots are smaller in proportion as they spring nearer to the base
of the bough they spring from.
