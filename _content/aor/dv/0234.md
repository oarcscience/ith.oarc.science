*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 234.

### PERSPECTIVE.

Why objects seen at a distance appear large to the eye and in the image
on the vertical plane they appear small.

### PERSPECTIVE.

I ask how far away the eye can discern a non-luminous body, as, for
instance, a mountain. It will be very plainly visible if the sun is
behind it; and could be seen at a greater or less distance according to
the sun's place in the sky.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_115"></span>[131:113](0234.htm#fr_115) : The clue to the
solution of this problem (lines 1-3) is given in lines 4-6, No. 232.
Objects seen with both eyes appear solid since they are seen from two
distinct points of sight separated by the distance between the eyes, but
this solidity cannot be represented in a flat drawing. Compare No. 535.
