*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 555.

### OF THE TREATMENT OF THE LIGHTS.

First give a general shadow to the whole of that extended part which is
away from the light. Then put in the half shadows and the strong
shadows, comparing them with each other and, in the same way give the
extended light in half tint, afterwards adding the half lights and the
high lights, likewise comparing them together.
