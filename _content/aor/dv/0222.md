### OF THE DIMINISHED DISTINCTNESS OF THE OUTLINES OF OPAQUE BODIES.

<span class="margnote"> Definition (222. 223).</span>If the real
outlines of opaque bodies are indistinguishable at even a very short
distance, they will be more so at long distances; and, since it is by
its outlines that we are able to know the real form of any opaque body,
when by its remoteness we fail to discern it as a whole, much more must
we fail to discern its parts and outlines.
