*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 672.

Il Moro as representing Good Fortune, with hair, and robes, and his
hands in front, and Messer Gualtieri taking him by the robes with a
respectful air from below, having come in from the front \[5\].

Again, Poverty in a hideous form running behind a youth. Il Moro covers
him with the skirt of his robe, and with his gilt sceptre he threatens
the monster.

A plant with its roots in the air to represent one who is at his
last;--a robe and Favour.

Of tricks \[*or* of magpies\] and of burlesque poems \[*or* of
starlings\].

Those who trust themselves to live near him, and who will be a large
crowd, these shall all die cruel deaths; and fathers and mothers
together with their families will be devoured and killed by cruel
creatures.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_310"></span>[350:308](0672.htm#fr_310) : 1--10 have already
been published by *Amoretti* in *Memorie Storiche* cap. XII. He adds
this note with regard to Gualtieri: "*A questo M. Gualtieri come ad uomo
generoso e benefico scrive il Bellincioni un Sonetto (pag, 174) per
chiedergli un piacere; e 'l Tantio rendendo ragione a Lodovico il Moro,
perche pubblicasse le Rime del Bellincioni; ciò hammi imposto, gli dice:
l'humano fidele, prudente e sollicito executore delli tuoi comandamenti
Gualtero, che fa in tutte le cose ove tu possi far utile, ogni studio vi
metti.*" A somewhat mysterious and evidently allegorical composition--a
pen and ink drawing--at Windsor, see PL LVIII, contains a group of
figures in which perhaps the idea is worked out which is spoken of in
the text, lines 1-5.
