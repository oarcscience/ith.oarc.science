### INTRODUCTION.

<span class="margnote"> General introductions to the book on Painting
(9-13).</span>Seeing that I can find no subject specially useful or
pleasing--since the men who have come before me have taken for their own
every useful or necessary theme--I must do like one who, being poor,
comes last to the fair, and can find no other way of providing himself
than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers, and not
taken but refused by reason of their lesser value. I, then, will load my
humble pack with this despised and rejected merchandise, the refuse of
so many buyers; and will go about to distribute it, not indeed in great
cities, but in the poorer towns, taking such a price as the wares I
offer may be worth.  <span id="fr_8"></span>[6](#fn_8)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_8"></span>[13:6](0009.htm#fr_8) : It need hardly be pointed
out that there is in this 'Proemio' a covert irony. In the second and
third prefaces, Leonardo characterises his rivals and opponents more
closely. His protest is directed against Neo-latinism as professed by
most of the humanists of his time; its futility is now no longer
questioned.
