### 560.

### ON PAINTING.

<span class="margnote"> The juxtaposition of light and shade (560,
561).</span>The comparison of the various qualities of shadows and
lights not infrequently seems ambiguous and confused to the painter who
desires to imitate and copy the objects he sees. The reason is this: If
you see a white drapery side by side with a black one, that part of the
white drapery which lies against the black one will certainly look much
whiter than the part which lies against something whiter than itself.

in my \[book on\] perspective.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_265"></span>[281:263](0560.htm#fr_265) : It is evident from
this that so early as in 1492 Leonardo's writing in perspective was so
far advanced that he could quote his own statements.--As bearing on this
subject compare what is said in No. 280.
