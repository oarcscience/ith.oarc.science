### VARNISH \[OR POWDER\].

<span class="margnote"> On varnishes \[or powders\]
(635-637).</span>Take cypress \[oil\] and distil it and have a large
pitcher, and put in the extract with so much water as may make it appear
like amber, and cover it tightly so that none may evaporate. And when it
is dissolved you may add in your pitcher as much of the said solution,
as shall make it liquid to your taste. And you must know that amber is
the gum of the cypress-tree.

### VARNISH \[OR POWDER\].

And since varnish \[powder\] is the resin of juniper, if you distil
juniper you can dissolve the said varnish \[powder\] in the essence, as
explained above.
