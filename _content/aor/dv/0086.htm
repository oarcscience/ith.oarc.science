The object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than
another of the same size at greater distance. The eye <I>m</I>, seeing
the spaces <I>o v x</I>, hardly detects the difference between them, and
the. reason of this is that it is close to them &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A>
; but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane <I>n o</I>
the space <I>o v</I> will be seen at <I>o r</I>, and in the same way the space
<I>v x</I> will appear at <I>r q</I>. And if you carry this out in any place
where you can walk round, it will look out of proportion by reason
of the great difference in the spaces <I>o r</I> and <I>r q</I>. And this
proceeds from the eye being so much below [near] the plane that the
plane is foreshortened. Hence, if you wanted to carry it out, you
would have [to arrange] to see the perspective through a single hole
which must be at the point <I>m</I>, or else you must go to a distance of
at least 3 times the height of the object you see. The plane <I>o p</I>
being always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects
in a satisfactory way, so that they may be seen from place to place.

quite inconceivable to me why M. RAVAISSON, in a note to his French
translation of this simple passage should have remarked: <I>Il est
clair que c'est par erreur que Leonard a &egrave;crit</I> per esser visino <I>au
lieu de</I> per non esser visino. (See his printed ed. of MS. A. p.
38.)</P>
