*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1299.

Blood will be seen issuing from the torn flesh of men, and trickling
down the surface.

Men will have such cruel maladies that they will tear their flesh with
their own nails. (The Itch.)

Plants will be seen left without leaves, and the rivers standing still
in their channels.

The waters of the sea will rise above the high peaks of the mountains
towards heaven and fall again on to the dwellings of men. (That is, in
Clouds.)

The largest trees of the forest will be seen carried by the fury of the
winds from East to West. (That is across the Sea.)

Men will cast away their own victuals. (That is, in Sowing.)
