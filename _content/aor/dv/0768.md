*[Pl. LXXXV](pl085.htm#img_pl085) No. 6 (MS. Ash. II 6b) contains a
small sketch of a capital with the following note, written in three
lines:* I chorni del capitelo deono essere la quarta parte d'uno quadro
*(The horns of a capital must measure the fourth part of a square).*

*MS. S. K. M. III 72b contains two sketches of ornamentations of
windows.*

*In MS. C. A. 308a; 938a (see [Pl. LXXXII](pl082.htm#img_pl082) No. 1)
there are several sketches of columns. One of the two columns on the
right is similar to those employed by Bramante at the Canonica di S.
Ambrogio. The same columns appear in the sketch underneath the plan of a
castle. There they appear coupled, and in two stories one above the
other. The archivolls which seem to spring out of the columns, are
shaped like twisted cords, meant perhaps to be twisted branches. The
walls between the columns seem to be formed out of blocks of wood, the
pedestals are ornamented with a reticulated pattern. From all this we
may suppose that Leonardo here had in mind either some festive
decoration, or perhaps a pavilion for some hunting place or park. The
sketch of columns marked "35" gives an example of columns shaped like
candelabra, a form often employed at that time, particularly in Milan,
and the surrounding districts for instance in the Cortile di Casa
Castiglione now Silvestre, in the cathedral of Como, at Porta della Rana
