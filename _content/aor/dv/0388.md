*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 388.

Why an impetus is not spent at once \[but diminishes\] gradually in some
one direction?  <span id="fr_195"></span>[193](#fn_195) The impetus
acquired in the line *a b c d* is spent in the line *d e* but not so
completely but that some of its force remains in it and to this force is
added the momentum in the line *d e* with the force of the motive power,
and it must follow than the impetus multiplied by the blow is greater
that the simple impetus produced by the momentum *d e*.

 <span id="fr_196"></span>[194](#fn_196) A man who has to deal a great
blow with his weapon prepares himself with all his force on the opposite
side to that where the spot is which he is to hit; and this is because a
body as it gains in velocity gains in force against the object which
impedes its motion.
