*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1257.

### THE AMPHISBOENA.

This has two heads, one in its proper place the other at the tail; as if
one place were not enough from which to fling its venom.

### THE IACULUS.

This lies on trees, and flings itself down like a dart, and pierces
through the wild beast and kills them.

### THE ASP.

The bite of this animal cannot be cured unless by immediately cutting
out the bitten part. This pestilential animal has such a love for its
mate that they always go in company. And if, by mishap, one of them is
killed the other, with incredible swiftness, follows him who has killed
it; and it is so determined and eager for vengeance that it overcomes
every difficulty, and passing by every troop it seeks to hurt none but
its enemy. And it will travel any distance, and it is impossible to
avoid it unless by crossing water and by very swift flight. It has its
eyes turned inwards, and large ears and it hears better than it sees.
