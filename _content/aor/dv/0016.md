### 16.

### THE DISCOURSE ON PAINTING.

Perspective, as bearing on drawing, is divided into three principal
sections; of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of
bodies at different distances. The second part is that which treats of
the diminution in colour in these objects. The third \[deals with\] the
diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by the
objects at various distances.
