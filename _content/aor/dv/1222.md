*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1222.

### PEACE.

We read of the beaver that when it is pursued, knowing that it is for
the virtue \[contained\] in its medicinal testicles and not being able
to escape, it stops; and to be at peace with its pursuers, it bites off
its testicles with its sharp teeth, and leaves them to its enemies.

### RAGE.

It is said of the bear that when it goes to the haunts of bees to take
their honey, the bees having begun to sting him he leaves the honey and
rushes to revenge himself. And as he seeks to be revenged on all those
that sting him, he is revenged on none; in such wise that his rage is
turned to madness, and he flings himself on the ground, vainly
exasperating, by his hands and feet, the foes against which he is
defending himself.
