*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1085.

The gulf of the Mediterranean, as an inland sea, received the principal
waters of Africa, Asia and Europe that flowed towards it; and its waters
came up to the foot of the mountains that surrounded it and made its
shores. And the summits of the Apennines stood up out of this sea like
islands, surrounded by salt water. Africa again, behind its Atlas
mountains did not expose uncovered to the sky the surface of its vast
plains about 3000 miles in length, and Memphis  <span

above the plains of Italy, where now birds fly in flocks, fish were wont
to wander in large shoals.
