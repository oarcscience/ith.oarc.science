<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE NATURE OF THE FOLDS IN DRAPERY.</H3>

<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> On draperies (390--392).</FONT></span>That part of a fold which is farthest from the ends where it is
confined will fall most nearly in its natural form.
<P>
Every thing by nature tends to remain at rest. Drapery, being of
equal density and thickness on its wrong side and on its right, has
a tendency to lie flat; therefore when you give it a fold or plait
forcing it out of its flatness note well the result of the
constraint in the part where it is most confined; and the part which
is farthest from this constraint you will see relapses most into the
natural state; that is to say lies free and flowing.

 Let <I>a b c</I> be the fold of the
drapery spoken of above, <I>a c</I> will be the places where this folded
drapery is held fast. I maintain that the part of the drapery which
is farthest from the plaited ends will revert most to its natural
form.
<P>
Therefore, <I>b</I> being farthest from <I>a</I> and <I>c</I> in the fold <I>a b c</I>
it will be wider there than anywhere else.
