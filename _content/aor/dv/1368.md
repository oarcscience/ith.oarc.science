Maestro Leonardo of Florence.  <span id="fr_389"></span>[695](#fn_389)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_389"></span>[415:695](1368.htm#fr_389) : So Leonardo writes
his name on a sheet with sundry short notes, evidently to try a pen.
Compare the signature with those in Nos. 1341, 1348 and 1374 (see also
No. 1346, l. 33). The form "Lionardo" does not occur in the autographs.
The Portrait of the Master in the Royal Library at Turin, which is
reproduced--slightly diminished--on [Pl. I](dv20946.htm#img_pl001), has
in the original two lines of writing underneath; one in red chalk of two
or three words is partly effaced: *lionardo it... lm* (or *lai*?); the
second written in pencil is as follows: *fatto da lui stesso assai
vecchio*. In both of these the writing is very like the Master's, but is
certainly only an imitation.
