<P><A NAME="fn_547"></A><A HREF="1504.htm#fr_547">458:847</A> : In the original, the passage given as No. 1463
is written between lines 2 and 3 of this text, and
it is possible that the entries in lines 3 and 4 refer
to the payments of Jacopo Tedesco, who is there
mentioned. The first words of these lines are very
illegible.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_548"></A><A HREF="1504.htm#fr_548">458:848</A> : 7. </I>Al fattore.<I> Il Fattore, was, as is well known,
the nick-name of Giovanni Franceso Penni, born in
Florence in 1486, and subsequently a pupil of Raphael's.
According to Vasari he was known by it
even as a boy. Whether he is spoken of in this
passage, or whether the word Fattore should be translated
literally, I will not undertake to decide. The
latter seems to me more probably right.</P>
