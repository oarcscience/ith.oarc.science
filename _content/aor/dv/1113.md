### ON MOVEMENTS;--TO KNOW HOW MUCH A SHIP ADVANCES IN AN HOUR.

<span class="margnote"> The ship's logs of Vitruvius, of Alberti and of
Leonardo</span>The ancients used various devices to ascertain the
distance gone by a ship each hour, among which Vitruvius  <span
id="fr_283"></span>[617](#fn_283) gives one in his work on Architecture
which is just as fallacious as all the others; and this is a mill wheel
which touches the waves of the sea at one end and in each complete
revolution describes a straight line which represents the circumference
of the wheel extended to a straightness. But this invention is of no
worth excepting on the smooth and motionless surface of lakes. But if
the water moves together with the ship at an equal rate, then the wheel
remains motionless; and if the motion of the water is more or less rapid
than that of the ship, then neither has the wheel the same motion as the
ship so that this invention is of but little use. There is another
method tried by experiment with a known distance between one island and
another; and this is done by a board or under the pressure of wind which
strikes on it with more or less swiftness. This is in Battista Alberti
 <span id="fr_284"></span>[618](#fn_284) .

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

Battista Alberti's method which is made by experiment on a known
distance between one island and another. But such an invention does not
succeed excepting on a ship like the one on which the experiment was
made, and it must be of the same burden and have the same sails, and the
sails in the same places, and the size of the waves must be the same.
But my method will serve for any ship, whether with oars or sails; and
whether it be small or large, broad or long, or high or low, it always
serves  <span id="fr_285"></span>[619](#fn_285) .

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_283"></span>[273:617](1113.htm#fr_283) 6: See VITRUVIUS,
*De Architectura lib. X.* C. 14 (p. 264 in the edition of Rose and
Muller- Strubing). The German edition published at Bale in 1543 has, on
fol. 596, an illustration of the contrivance, as described by Vitruvius.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[273:618](1113.htm#fr_284) 25: LEON BATTISTA
ALBERTI, *De Architectura lib. V.*, c. 12 treats '*de le navi e parti
loro*', but there is no reference to the machine, mentioned by Leonardo.
Alberti says here: *Noi abbiamo trattato lungamente in altro luogo de'
modi de le navi, ma in questo luogo ne abbiamo detto quel tanto che si
bisogna*. To this the following note is added in the most recent Italian
edition: *Questo libro e tuttora inedito e porta il titolo, secondo
Gesnero di* '*Liber navis*'.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[274:619](1113.htm#fr_285) 52: Leonardo does
not reveal the method invented by him.
