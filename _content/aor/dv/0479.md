*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 479.

<span class="margnote"> Of rainbows and rain (479. 480).</span>The
colours in the middle of the rainbow mingle together.

The bow in itself is not in the rain nor in the eye that sees it; though
it is generated by the rain, the sun, and the eye. The rainbow is always
seen by the eye that is between the rain and the body of the sun; hence
if the sun is in the East and the rain is in the West it will appear on
the rain in the West.
