This building is inhabited below and above; the way up is by the
campaniles, and in going up one has to use the platform, where the
drums of the four domes are, and this platform has a parapet in
front, and none of these domes communicate with the church, but they
are quite separate.

seen from behind; this recalls the Duomo at Florence, but with two
campaniles</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">379</FONT></A>

<I><A HREF="pl097.htm#img_pl097">Pl. XCVII</A> No. 3 (MS. B. 52a). The central part is a development of
S. Lorenzo at Milan, such as was executed at the Duomo of Pavia.
There is sufficient analogy between the building actually executed
and this sketch to suggest a direct connection between them.
Leonardo accompanied Francesco di Giorgio</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">380</FONT></A>
 <I>when the latter was consulted on June
21st, 1490 as to this church; the fact that the only word
accompanying the plan is:</I> "sagrestia", <I>seems to confirm our
supposition, for the sacristies were added only in 1492, i. e. four
years after the beginning of the Cathedral, which at that time was
most likely still sufficiently unfinished to be capable of receiving
the form of the present sketch.

<A HREF="pl097.htm#img_pl097">Pl. XCVII</A> No. 2 shows the exterior of this design. Below is the
note:</I> edifitio al proposito del fodameto figurato di socto
<I>(edifice proper for the ground plan figured below).
<P>
Here we may also mention the plan of a Latin cross drawn in MS. C.
A. fol. 266 (see p. 50).

Florentine basilica San Lorenzo, seen from the North.

<A HREF="pl094.htm#img_pl094">Pl. XCIV</A> No. 4 (V. A. V, 1). Principal front of a nave, most likely
of a church on the plan of a Latin cross. We notice here not only
the</I>

<P><I>principal features which were employed afterwards in Alberti's
front of S. Maria Novella, but even details of a more advanced
style, such as we are accustomed to meet with only after the year 1520.

In the background of Leonardo's unfinished picture of St. Jerome
(Vatican Gallery) a somewhat similar church front is indicated (see
the accompanying sketch).</I>

<I>The view of the front of a temple,
apparently a dome in the centre of four corinthian porticos bearing
pediments (published by Amoretti Tav. II. B as being by Leonardo),
is taken from a drawing, now at the Ambrosian Gallery. We cannot
consider this to be by the hand of the master.</I>
