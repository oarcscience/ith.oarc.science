### I. General Introduction to the Book on Painting

<span class="margnote"> The author's intention to publish his
MSS.</span>How by a certain machine many may stay some time under water.
And how and wherefore I do not describe my method of remaining under
water and how long I can remain without eating. And I do not publish nor
divulge these, by reason of the evil nature of men, who would use them
for assassinations at the bottom of the sea by destroying ships, and
sinking them, together with the men in them. Nevertheless I will impart
others, which are not dangerous because the mouth of the tube through
which you breathe is above the water, supported on air sacks or cork.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[11:1](0001.htm#fr_3) : The leaf on which this
passage is written, is headed with the words *Casi* 39, and most of
these cases begin with the word '*Come*', like the two here given, which
are the 26th and 27th. 7. *Sughero*. In the Codex Antlanticus 377a;
1170a there is a sketch, drawn with the pen, representing a man with a
tube in his mouth, and at the farther end of the tube a disk. By the
tube the word '*Channa*' is written, and by the disk the word
'*sughero*'.
