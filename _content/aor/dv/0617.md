*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 617.

Very excellent will be a stiff white paper, made of the usual mixture
and filtered milk of an herb called calves foot; and when this paper is
prepared and damped and folded and wrapped up it may be mixed with the
mixture and thus left to dry; but if you break it before it is moistened
it becomes somewhat like the thin paste called *lasagne* and you may
then damp it and wrap it up and put it in the mixture and leave it to
dry; or again this paper may be covered with stiff transparent white and
*sardonio* and then damped so that it may not form angles and then
covered up with strong transparent size and as soon as it is firm cut it
two fingers, and leave it to dry; again you may make stiff cardboard of
*sardonio* and dry it and then place it between two sheets of papyrus
and break it inside with a wooden mallet with a handle and

then open it with care holding the lower sheet of paper flat and firm so
that the broken pieces be not separated; then have a sheet of paper
covered with hot glue and apply it on the top of all these pieces and
let them stick fast; then turn it upside down and apply transparent size
several times in the spaces between the pieces, each time pouring in
first some black and then some stiff white and each time leaving it to
dry; then smooth it and polish it.
