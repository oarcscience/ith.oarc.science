*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1300.

Human beings will be seen who will not understand each other's speech;
that is, a German with a Turk.

Fathers will be seen giving their daughters into the power of man and
giving up all their former care in guarding them. (When Girls are
married.)

Men will come out their graves turned into flying creatures; and they
will attack other men, taking their food from their very hand or table.
(As Flies.)

Many will there be who, flaying their mother, will tear the skin from
her back. (Husbandmen tilling the Earth.)

Happy will they be who lend ear to the words of the Dead. (Who read good
works and obey them.)
