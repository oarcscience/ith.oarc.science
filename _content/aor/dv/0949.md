### 949.

### THAT THE OCEAN DOES NOT PENETRATE UNDER THE EARTH.

The ocean does not penetrate under the earth, and this we learn from the
many and various springs of fresh water which, in many parts of the
ocean make their way up from the bottom to the surface. The same thing
is farther proved by wells dug beyond the distance of a mile from the
said ocean, which fill with fresh water; and this happens because the
fresh water is lighter than salt water and consequently more
penetrating.

Which weighs most, water when frozen or when not frozen?

### FRESH WATER PENETRATES MORE AGAINST SALT WATER THAN SALT WATER AGAINST FRESH WATER.

That fresh water penetrates more against salt water, than salt water
against fresh is proved by a thin cloth dry and old, hanging with the
two opposite ends equally low in the two different waters, the surfaces
of which are at an equal level; and it will then be seen how much higher
the fresh water will rise in this piece of linen than the salt; by so
much is the fresh lighter than the salt.
