### 956.

Whether the flow and ebb are caused by the moon or the sun, or are the
breathing of this terrestrial machine. That the flow and ebb are
different in different countries and seas.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_169"></span>[192:503](0956.htm#fr_169) : 1. Allusion may
here be made to the mythological explanation of the ebb and flow given
in the Edda. Utgardloki says to Thor (Gylfaginning 48): "When thou wert
drinking out of the horn, and it seemed to thee that it was slow in
emptying a wonder befell, which I should not have believed possible: the
other end of the horn lay in the sea, which thou sawest not; but when
thou shalt go to the sea, thou shalt see how much thou hast drunk out of
it. And that men now call the ebb tide."

Several passages in various manuscripts treat of the ebb and flow. In
collecting them I have been guided by the rule only to transcribe those
which named some particular spot.
