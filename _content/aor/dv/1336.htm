the city of Calindrafy[&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>], near to our frontiers. This city is
situated at the base of that part of the Taurus mountains which is
divided from the Euphrates and looks towards the peaks of the great
Mount Taurus [&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>] to the West [&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>]. These peaks are of such a height

resplendently and fulfils the function to these Armenians which a
bright moon-light would in the midst of the darkness; and by its
great height it outreaches the utmost level of the clouds by a space
of four miles in a straight line. This peak is seen in many places
towards the West, illuminated by the sun after its setting the third
part of the night. This it is, which with you [&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>] we formerly
in calm weather had supposed to be a comet, and appears to us in the
darkness of night, to change its form, being sometimes divided in two
or three parts, and sometimes long and sometimes short. And this is
caused by the clouds on the horizon of the sky which interpose between
part of this mountain and the sun, and by cutting off some of the solar
rays the light on the mountain is intercepted by various intervals
of clouds, and therefore varies in the form of its brightness.

I will pass over any description of the form of Asia Minor, or as to
what seas or lands form the limits of its outline and extent,
because I know that by your own diligence and carefulness in your
studies you have not remained in ignorance of these matters [65];
and I will go on to describe the true form of the Taurus Mountain
which is the cause of this stupendous and harmful marvel, and which
will serve to advance us in our purpose [66]. This Taurus is that
mountain which, with many others is said to be the ridge of Mount
Caucasus; but wishing to be very clear about it, I desired to speak
to some of the inhabitants of the shores of the Caspian sea, who
give evidence that this must be the true Caucasus, and that though
their mountains bear the same name, yet these are higher; and to
confirm this in the Scythian tongue Caucasus means a very high&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A>
peak, and in fact we have no information of there being, in the East or in the
West, any mountain so high. And the proof of this is that the
inhabitants of the countries to the West see the rays of the sun
illuminating a great part of its summit for as much as a quarter of
the longest night. And in the same way, in those countries which lie
to the East.

<P>
[&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A>] The shadow of this ridge of the Taurus is of such a height
that when, in the middle of June, the Sun is at its meridian, its

<P>


<P>


<P><A NAME="page_391"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 391</FONT></A></P>
<P>shadow extends as far as the borders of Sarmatia, twelve days off;
and in the middle of December it extends as far as the Hyperborean
mountains, which are at a month's journey to the North [75]. And
the side which faces the wind is always free from clouds and mists,
because the wind which is parted in beating on the rock, closes
again on the further side of that rock, and in its motion carries
with it the clouds from all quarters and leaves them where it
strikes. And it is always full of thunderbolts from the great
quantity of clouds which accumulate there, whence the rock is all
riven and full of huge d&acute;bris[&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A>]. This mountain, at its base, is
inhabited by a very rich population and is full of most beautiful
springs and rivers, and is fertile and abounding in all good
produce, particularly in those parts which face to the South. But
after mounting about three miles we begin to find forests of great
fir trees, and beech and other similar trees; after this, for a
space of three more miles, there are meadows and vast pastures; and
all the rest, as far as the beginning of the Taurus, is eternal snow
<P>


<P><A NAME="page_392"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 392</FONT></A></P>
<P>which never disappear at any time, and extend to a height of
about fourteen miles in all. From this beginning of the Taurus up to
the height of a mile the clouds never pass away; thus we have
fifteen miles, that is, a height of about five miles in a straight
line; and the summit of the peaks of the Taurus are as much, or
about that. There, half way up, we begin to find a scorching air and
never feel a breath of wind; but nothing can live long there; there
nothing is brought forth save a few birds of prey which breed in the
high fissures of Taurus and descend below the clouds to seek their
prey. Above the wooded hills all is bare rock, that is, from the
clouds upwards; and the rock is the purest white. And it is
impossible to walk to the high summit on account of the rough and
perilous ascent.

<P><A NAME="fn_336"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_336">385:1</A> <I>Diodario.</I> This word is not to be found in any Italian
dictionary, and for a long time I vainly sought an explanation of
it. The youthful reminiscences of my wife afforded the desired clue.
The chief town of each Turkish Villayet, or province --such as
Broussa, for instance, in Asia Minor, is the residence of a
Defterdar, who presides over the financial affairs of the province.
<I>Defterdar hane</I> was, in former times, the name given to the
Ministry of Finance at Constantinople; the Minister of Finance to
the Porte is now known as the <I>Mallie-Nazri</I> and the <I>Defterdars</I>
are his subordinates. A <I>Defterdar</I>, at the present day is merely
the head of the finance department in each Provincial district. With
regard to my suggestion that Leonardo's <I>Diodario</I> might be
identical with the Defterdar of former times, the late M. C.
DEFREMERIE, Arabic Professor, and Membre de l'Institut de France
wrote to me as follows: <I>Votre conjecture est parfaitement fondee;
diodario est Vequivalent de devadar ou plus exactement devatdar,
titre d'une importante dignite en Egypt'e, sous les Mamlouks.</I>
<P>
The word however is not of Turkish, but of Perso-Arabie derivation.
<I>Defter</I> (Arabic) means <I>folio</I>; for <I>dar</I> (Persian) Bookkeeper
or holder is the English equivalent; and the idea is that of a deputy in command.
During the Mamelook supremacy over Syria, which corresponded in date with
Leonardo's time, the office of Defterdar was the third in importance
in the State.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_337"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_337">385:2</A> <I>Soltano di Babilonia</I>. The name of Babylon was commonly applied to
Cairo in the middle ages. For instance BREIDENBACH, <I>Itinerarium
Hierosolyma</I> p. 218 says: "At last we reached Babylon. But this is
not that Babylon which stood on the further shore of the river
Chober, but that which is called the Egyptian Babylon. It is close
by Cairo and the twain are but one and not two towns; one half is
called Cairo and the other Babylon, whence they are called together
Cairo-Babylon; originally the town is said to have been named
Memphis and then Babylon, but now it is called Cairo." Compare No. 1085, 6.
<P>
Egypt was governed from 1382 till 1517 by the Borgite or
Tcherkessian dynasty of the Mamelook Sultans. One of the most famous
of these, Sultan Kait Bey, ruled from 1468-1496 during whose reign
the Gama (or Mosque) of Kait Bey and tomb of Kait Bey near the
Okella Kait Bey were erected in Cairo, which preserve his name to
this day. Under the rule of this great and wise prince many
foreigners, particularly Italians, found occupation in Egypt, as may
be seen in the 'Viaggio di Josaphat Barbaro', among other
travellers. "Next to Leonardo (so I learn from Prof. Jac. Burckhardt
of Bale) Kait Bey's most helpful engineer was a German <A NAME="page_386"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 386</FONT></A> who in about
1487, superintended the construction of the Mole at Alexandria.
Felix Fabri knew him and mentions him in his <I>Historia Suevorum</I>,
written in 1488."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_338"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_338">385:3</A> <I>Il nuovo accidente
accaduto</I>, or as Leonardo first wrote and then erased, <I>e accaduto
un nuovo accidente</I>. From the sequel this must refer to an
earthquake, and indeed these were frequent at that period,
particularly in Asia Minor, where they caused immense mischief. See
No. 1101 note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_339"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_339">386:4</A> The text here
breaks off. The following lines are a fresh beginning of a letter,
evidently addressed to the same person, but, as it would seem,
written at a later date than the previous text. The numerous
corrections and amendments amply prove that it is not a copy from
any account of a journey by some unknown person; but, on the
contrary, that Leonardo was particularly anxious to choose such
words and phrases as might best express his own ideas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_340"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_340">386:5</A> <I>Parti d'Erminia</I>. See No. 945, note. The extent of Armenia in Leonardo's
time is only approximately known. In the XVth century the Persians
governed the Eastern, and the Arabs the Southern portions. Arabic
authors--as, for instance Abulfeda--include Cilicia and a part of
Cappadocia in Armenia, and Greater Armenia was the tract of that
country known later as Turcomania, while Armenia Minor was the
territory between Cappadocia and the Euphrates. It was not till
1522, or even 1574 that the whole country came under the dominion of
the Ottoman Turks, in the reign of Selim I.
<P>
The Mamelook Sultans of Egypt seem to have taken a particular
interest in this, the most Northern province of their empire, which
was even then in danger of being conquered by the Turks. In the
autumn of 1477 Sultan Kait Bey made a journey of inspection,
visiting Antioch and the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates with a
numerous and brilliant escort. This tour is briefly alluded to by
<I>Moodshireddin</I> p. 561; and by WEIL, <I>Geschichte der Abbasiden</I> V,
p. 358. An anonymous member of the suite wrote a diary of the
expedition in Arabic, which has been published by R. V. LONZONE
(<I>'Viaggio in Palestina e Soria di Kaid Ba XVIII sultano della II
dinastia mamelucca, fatto nel 1477. Testo arabo. Torino 1878'</I>,
without notes or commentary). Compare the critique on this edition,
by J. GILDEMEISTER in <I>Zeitschrift des Deutschen Palaestina Vereins</I>
(Vol. Ill p. 246--249). Lanzone's edition seems to be no more than
an abridged copy of the original. I owe to Professor Sche'fer,
Membre de l'Institut, the information that he is in possession of a
manuscript in which the text is fuller, and more correctly given.
The Mamelook dynasty was, as is well known, of Circassian origin,
and a large proportion of the Egyptian Army was recruited in
Circassia even so late as in the XVth century. That was a period of
political storms in Syria and Asia Minor and it is easy to suppose
that the Sultan's minister, to whom Leonardo addresses his report as
his superior, had a special interest in the welfare of those
frontier provinces. Only to mention a few historical events of
Sultan Kait Bey's reign, we find that in 1488 he assisted the
Circassians to resist the encroachments of Alaeddoulet, an Asiatic
prince who had allied himself with the Osmanli to threaten the
province; the consequence was a war in Cilicia by sea and land,
which broke out in the following year between the contending powers.
Only a few years earlier the same province had been the scene of the
so-called Caramenian war in which the united Venetian, Neapolitan
and Sclavonic fleets had been engaged. (See CORIALANO CIPPICO,
<I>Della guerra dei Veneziani nell' Asia dal</I> 1469--1474. Venezia
1796, p. 54) and we learn incidentally that a certain Leonardo
Boldo, Governor of Scutari under Sultan Mahmoud,--as his name would
indicate, one of the numerous renegades of Italian birth--played an
important part in the negotiations for peace.
<P>
<I>Tu mi mandasti</I>. The address <I>tu</I> to a personage so high in office
is singular and suggests personal intimacy; Leonardo seems to have
been a favourite with the Diodario. Compare lines 54 and 55.
<P>
I have endeavoured to show, and I believe that I am also in a
position to prove with regard to these texts, that they are draughts
of letters actually written by Leonardo; at the same time I must not
omit to mention that shortly after I had discovered <A NAME="page_387"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 387</FONT></A>
these texts in the Codex Atlanticus and publi- shed a paper on the
subject in the <I>Zeit- schrift fur bildende Kunst (Vol. XVI)</I>, Prof.
Govi put forward this hypothesis to account for their origin:
<P>
<I>"Quanto alle notizie sul monte Tauro, sull'Armenia e sull' Asia
minore che si contengono negli altri frammenti, esse vennero prese
da qualche geografro o viaggiatore contemporaneo. Dall'indice
imperfetto che accompagna quei frammenti, si potrebbe dedurre che
Leonardo volesse farne un libro, che poi non venne compiuto. A ogni
modo, non e possibile di trovare in questi brani nessun indizio di
un viaggio di Leonardo in oriente, ne della sua conversione alla
religione di Maometto, come qualcuno pretenderebbe. Leonardo amava
con passione gli studi geografici, e nel suoi scritti s'incontran
spesso itinerart, indicazioni, o descrizioni di luoghi, schizzi di
carte e abbozzi topografici di varie regioni, non e quindi strano
che egli, abile narratore com'era, si fosse proposto di scrivere una
specie di Romanzo in forma epistolare svolgendone Pintreccio
nell'Asia Minore, intorno alla quale i libri d'allora, e forse
qualche viaggiatore amico suo, gli avevano somministrato alcuni
elementi piu o meno</I> fantastici. (See Transunti della Reale Accademia
dei Lincei Voi. V Ser. 3).
<P>
It is hardly necessary to point out that Prof. Govi omits to name
the sources from which Leonardo could be supposed to have drawn his
information, and I may leave it to the reader to pronounce judgment
on the anomaly which is involved in the hypothesis that we have here
a fragment of a Romance, cast in the form of a correspondence. At
the same time, I cannot but admit that the solution of the
difficulties proposed by Prof. Govi is, under the circumstances,
certainly the easiest way of dealing with the question. But we
should then be equally justified in supposing some more of
Leonardo's letters to be fragments of such romances; particularly
those of which the addresses can no longer be named. Still, as
regards these drafts of letters to the Diodario, if we accept the
Romance theory, as pro- posed by Prof. Govi, we are also compelled
to assume that Leonardo purposed from the first to illustrate his
tale; for it needs only a glance at the sketches on <A HREF="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</A> to CXIX
to perceive that they are connected with the texts; and of course
the rest of Leonardo's numerous notes on matters pertaining to the East,
the greater part of which are here published for the first time, may also
be somehow connected with this strange romance.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_341"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_341">387:7</A> <I>Citt&agrave; de Calindra</I> (<I>Chalindra</I>). The position of this city is so
exactly determined, between the valley of the Euphrates and the
Taurus range that it ought to be possible to identify it. But it can
hardly be the same as the sea port of Cilicia with a somewhat
similar name Celenderis, Kelandria, Celendria, Kilindria, now the
Turkish Gulnar. In two Catalonian Portulans in the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale in Paris-one dating from the XV<sup>th</sup> century, by Wilhelm
von Soler, the other by Olivez de Majorca, in l584--I find this place
called Calandra. But Leonardo's Calindra must certainly have lain
more to the North West, probably somewhere in Kurdistan. The fact
that the geographical position is so carefully determined by
Leonardo seems to prove that it was a place of no great importance
and little known. It is singular that the words first written in l.
8 were <I>divisa dal lago</I> (Lake Van?), altered afterwards to
<I>dall'Eufrates</I>.
<P>
<I>Nostri confini</I>, and in 1. 6 <I>proposito nostro</I>. These refer to the
frontier and to the affairs of the Mamelook Sultan, Lines 65 and 66
throw some light on the purpose of Leonardo's mission.</P>

So long as it is impossible to identify the situation
of Calindra it is most difficult to decide with any certainty which
peak of the Taurus is here meant; and I greatly regret that I had no
foreknowledge of this puzzling topographical question when, in 1876,
I was pursuing archaeological enquiries in the Provinces of Aleppo
and Cilicia, and had to travel for some time in view of the imposing
snow-peaks of Bulghar Dagh and Ala Tepessi.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_343"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_343">387:9</A>-10 The opinion here expressed as to the height of the mountain
would be unmeaning, unless it had been written before Leonardo moved
to Milan, where Monte Rosa is so conspicuous an object in the
landscape. 4 <I>ore inanzi</I> seems to mean, four hours before the sun's
rays penetrate to the bottom of the valleys.</P>

and I observed it in North Syria (at Aleppo? at Aintas?). The
description of the curious reflection in the evening, resembling the
"Alpine-glow" is certainly not an invented fiction, for in the next
lines an explanation of the phenomenon is offered, or at least
attempted.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_346"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_346">388:19</A> The next 33 lines are

stands as an abbreviation for <I>predicazione</I> (lat. <I>praedicatio</I>)
in the sense of praise or glorification; very probably it may mean

and written by Djelal eddin <A NAME="page_389"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 389</FONT></A> Syouthy, the following statement occurs:
"In the year 889 (1484 A.D.) there were six shocks of earthquake
at Aleppo. They were excessively violent
and threw the inhabitants into consternation." I owe this
communication to the kindness of Prof. Ch. Schefer, Membre de
l'Institut, to whom this unpublished Arabic MS. belongs. The
foregoing entries refer to two earthquakes in Cairo, in 1476 and
1481: the following ones indicate a time at which Leonardo was,
certainly, living in Milan.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_350"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_350">389:36</A> <I>Tagliata di Monte Tauro</I>. The Euphrates flows through the
Taurus range near the influx of the Kura Shai; it rushes through a
rift in the wildest cliffs from 2000 to 3000 feet high and runs on
for 90 miles in 300 falls or rapids till it reaches Telek, near
which at a spot called Gleikash, or the Hart's leap, it measures only 35
paces across. Compare the map on <A HREF="pl119.htm#img_pl119">Pl. CXIX</A> and the explanation
<A HREF="errata.htm#2">for</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_351"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_351">389:40</A> <I>Nova profeta</I>, 1. 33, <I>profeta</I>. Mohammed. Leonardo here
refers to the Koran:
<P>
<I>In the name of the most merciful God.--When the earth shall be
shaken by an earthquake; and the earth shall cast forth her burdens;
and a man shall say, what aileth her? On that day the earth shall
declare her tidings, for that thy Lord will inspire her. On that day
men shall go forward in distinct classes, that they may behold their
works. And whoever shall have wrought good of the weight of an ant,
shall behold the same. And whoever shall have wrought evil of the
weight of an ant, shall behold the same.</I> (The Koran, translated by
G. Sale, Chapter XCIX, p. 452).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_352"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_352">389:53</A>--94: The facsimile of this passage is given on <A HREF="pl117.htm#img_pl117">Pl. CXVII</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_353"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_353">389:54</A> The foregoing sketch of a letter, lines 5. 18, appears to
have remained a fragment when Leonardo received pressing orders
which caused him to write immediately and fully on the subject
mentioned in line 43.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_354"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_354">390:59</A> This passage was evidently intended as an improvement
on that immediately preceding it. The purport of both is essentially
the same, but the first is pitched in a key of ill-disguised
annoyance which is absent from the second. I do not see how these
two versions can be reconciled with the romance-theory held by Prof.
Govi.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_357"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_357">390:73</A>--75: The statements are of course founded on those of the
'inhabitants' spoken of in l. 67.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_358"></A><A HREF="1336.htm#fr_358">391:77</A> Sudden storms are equally common on the heights of Ararat.
It is hardly necessary to observe that Ararat cannot be meant here.
Its summit is formed like the crater of Vesuvius. The peaks sketched
on <A HREF="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</A>-CXVIII are probably views of the same mountain, taken
from different sides. Near the solitary peak, <A HREF="pl118.htm#img_pl118">Pl. CXVIII</A> these three
names are written <I>goba, arnigasar, caruda</I>, names most likely of
different peaks. <A HREF="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</A> and <A HREF="pl117.htm#img_pl117">CXVII</A> are in the original on a single
sheet folded down the middle, 30 centimetres high and 43 1/2 wide.
On the reverse of one half of the sheet are notes on <I>peso</I> and <I>bilancia</I> 
(weight and balance), on the other are the 'prophecies' printed under
Nos. 1293 and 1294. It is evident from the arrangement that these were written
subsequently, on the space which had been left blank. These pages
are facsimiled on <A HREF="pl118.htm#img_pl118">Pl. CXVIII</A>. In <A HREF="pl116.htm#img_pl116">Pl. CXVI</A>-CXVIII the size is smaller
than in the original; the map of Armenia, <A HREF="pl118.htm#img_pl118">Pl. CXVIII</A>, is on <A HREF="pl119.htm#img_pl119">Pl. CXIX</A>
slightly enlarged. On this map we find the following names,
beginning from the right hand at the top: <I>pariardes mo</I> (for
Paryadres Mons, Arm. Parchar, now Barchal or Kolai Dagh; Trebizond
is on its slope).
<P>
<I>Aquilone</I> --North, <I>Antitaurus Antitaurus psis mo</I> ///// (probably
meant for Thospitis = Lake Van, Arm. Dgov Vanai, Tospoi, and the
Mountain range to the South); <I>Gordis mo</I> (Mountains of Gordyaea),
the birth place of the Tigris; <I>Oriente</I> --East; <I>Tigris</I>, and then,
to the left, <I>Eufrates</I>. Then, above to the left <I>Argeo mo</I> (now
Erdshigas, an extinct volcano, 12000 feet high); <I>Celeno mo</I> (no
doubt Sultan Dagh in Pisidia). Celeno is the Greek town of
&#0922;&#0949;&#0955;&#0945;&#0953;&#0957;&#0945;&#8055;-- see Arian I, 29, I--<font size="-1" color="green">(</font>now the ruins of Dineir); <I>oriente</I>
--East; <I>africo libezco</I> (for libeccio--South West). In the middle
of the Euphrates river on this small map we see a shaded portion
surrounded by mountains, perhaps to indicate the inundation
mentioned in l. 35. The affluent to the Euphrates shown as coming
with many windings from the high land of 'Argeo' on the West, is the
Tochma Su, which joins the main river at Malatie. I have not been
able to discover any map of Armenia of the XVth or XVIth century in
which the course of the Euphrates is laid down with any thing like
the correctness displayed in this sketch. The best I have seen is
the Catalonian Portulan of Olivez de Majorca, executed in 1584, and
it is far behind Leonardo's.</P>
