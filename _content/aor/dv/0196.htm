<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE BODY WHICH IS NEAREST TO THE LIGHT CASTS THE LARGEST SHADOW, AND WHY?</H3>
<P>
<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> On the relative size of shadows (196. 197).</FONT></span>If an object placed in front of a single light is very close to it
you will see that it casts a very large shadow on the opposite wall,
and the farther you remove the object from the light the smaller
will the image of the shadow become.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">WHY A SHADOW LARGER THAN THE BODY THAT PRODUCES IT BECOMES OUT OF PROPORTION.</H3>
<P>
The disproportion of a shadow which is larger than the body
producing it, results from the light being smaller than the body, so
that it cannot be at an equal distance from the edges of the body
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">94</FONT></A>
; and the portions
which are most remote are made larger than the nearer portions for
this reason &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">95</FONT></A>
.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">WHY A SHADOW WHICH IS LARGER THAN THE BODY CAUSING IT HAS ILL-DEFINED OUTLINES.</H3>
<P>
The atmosphere which surrounds a light is almost like light itself
for brightness and
<P><A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></P>
<P>colour; but the farther off it is the more it
loses this resemblance. An object which casts a large shadow and is
near to the light, is illuminated both by that light by the luminous
atmosphere; hence this diffused light gives the shadow ill-defined
edges.

<P><A NAME="fn_96"></A><A HREF="0196.htm#fr_96">109:94</A>  11: H. LUDWIG in his edition of the old copies, in the
Vatican library--in which this chapter is included under Nos. 612,
613 and 614 alters this passage as follows: <I>quella parte ch'e piu
propinqua piu cresce che le distanti</I>, although the Vatican copy
agrees with the original MS. in having <I>distante</I> in the former and
<I>propinque</I> in the latter place. This supposed amendment seems to me
to invert the facts. Supposing for instance, that on <A HREF="pl031.htm#img_pl031">Pl. XXXI</A> No. 3.
<I>f</I> is the spot where the light is that illuminates the figure there
represented, and that the line behind the figure represents a wall
on which the shadow of the figure is thrown. It is evident, that in
that case the nearest portion, in this case the under part of the
thigh, is very little magnified in the shadow, and the remoter
parts, for instance the head, are more magnified.</P>
