### 859.

<span class="margnote"> The fundamental laws of the solar system
(859-864).</span>Force arises from dearth or abundance; it is the child
of physical motion, and the grand-child of spiritual motion, and the
mother and origin of gravity. Gravity is limited to the elements of
water and earth; but this force is unlimited, and by it infinite worlds
might be moved if instruments could be made by which the force could be
generated.

Force, with physical motion, and gravity, with resistance are the four
external powers on which all actions of mortals depend.

Force has its origin in spiritual motion; and this motion, flowing
through the limbs of sentient animals, enlarges their muscles. Being
enlarged by this current the muscles are shrunk in length and contract
the tendons which are connected with them, and this is the cause of the
force of the limbs in man.

The quality and quantity of the force of a man are able to give birth to
other forces, which will be proportionally greater as the motions
produced by them last longer.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_107"></span>[138:441](0859.htm#fr_107) : Only part of this
passage belongs, strictly speaking, to this section. The principle laid
down in the second paragraph is more directly connected with the notes
given in the preceding section on Physiology.
