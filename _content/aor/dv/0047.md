### 47.

### DEFINITION OF THE NATURE OF THE LINE.

<span class="margnote"> Of the line (47-48).</span>The line has in
itself neither matter nor substance and may rather be called an
imaginary idea than a real object; and this being its nature it occupies
no space. Therefore

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

an infinite number of lines may be conceived of as intersecting each
other at a point, which has no dimensions and is only of the thickness
(if thickness it may be called) of one single line.

### HOW WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A SUPERFICIES TERMINATES IN A POINT?

<span id="img_v102900"></span> ![](img/v102900.jpg)

An angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an
angle. Or, if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight line,
then--beyond that angle--another surface is generated, smaller, or equal
to, or larger than the first.
