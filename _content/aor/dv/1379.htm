Vitolone</I> see No. 1506 note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_401"></A><A HREF="1379.htm#fr_401">421:707</A> : 7 and fol. It would seem from the text that Leonardo
intended to have instructions in painting on paper. It is hardly
necessary to point out that the Art of illuminating was quite
separate from that of painting.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_402"></A><A HREF="1379.htm#fr_402">421:708</A> : The mysterious looking words, quite
distinctly written, in line 1: <I>ingol, amor a, ilopan a</I> and
on line 2: <I>enoiganod al</I> are obviously in cipher and the solution
is a simple one; by reading them backwards we find for <I>ingol</I>: logni-probably <I>longi</I>,
evidently the name of a person; for <I>amor a</I>: <I>a Roma</I>, for <I>ilopan
a</I>: <I>a Napoli</I>. Leonardo has done the same in two passages treating
on some secrets of his art Nos. 641 and 729, the only other places
in which we find this cipher employed; we may therefore conclude
that it was for the sake of secrecy that he used it.
<P>
There can be no doubt, from the tenor of this passage, that Leonardo
projected a secret excursion to Naples. Nothing has hitherto been
known of this journey, but the significance of the passage will be
easily understood by a reference to the following notes, from which
we may infer that Leonardo really had at the time plans for
travelling further than Naples. From lines 3, 4 and 7 it is evident
that he purposed, after selling every thing that was not easily
portable, to leave a chest in the care of his relations at Vinci.
His luggage was to be packed into two trunks especially adapted for
transport by mules. The exact meaning of many sentences in the
following notes must necessarily remain obscure. These brief remarks
on small and irrelevant affairs and so forth are however of no
historical value. The notes referring to the preparations for his
journey are more intelligible.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_403"></A><A HREF="1379.htm#fr_403">422:709</A>  11. 'De Ponderibus'. A large number of Leonardo's
notes bear this superscription. Compare No. 1436, 3.</P>
