*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1027.

Again if the lowest part of the bank which lies across the current of
the waters is made in deep and wide steps, after the manner of stairs,
the waters which, in their course usually fall perpendicularly from the
top of such a place to the bottom, and wear away the foundations of this
bank can no longer descend with a blow of too great a force; and I find
the example of this in the stairs down which the water falls in the
fields at Sforzesca at Vigevano over which the running water falls for a
height of 50 braccia.
