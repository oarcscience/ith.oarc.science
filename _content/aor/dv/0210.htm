No man can see the image of another man in a mirror in its proper
place with regard to the objects; because every object falls on [the
surface of] the mirror at equal angles. And if the one man, who sees
the other in the mirror, is not in a direct line with the image he
will not see it in the place where it really falls; and if he gets
into the line, he covers the other man and puts himself in the place
occupied

<P>by his image. Let <I>n o</I> be the mirror, <I>b</I> the eye of your
friend and <I>d</I> your own eye. Your friend's eye will appear to you at
<I>a</I>, and to him it will seem that yours is at <I>c</I>, and the
intersection of the visual rays will occur at <I>m</I>, so that either of
you touching <I>m</I> will touch the eye of the other man which shall be
open. And if you touch the eye of the other man in the mirror it
will seem to him that you are touching your own.
