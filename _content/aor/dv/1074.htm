The river Loire at Amboise.
<P>
The river is higher within the bank <I>b d</I> than outside that bank.
<P>
The island where there is a part of Amboise.
<P>
This is the river that passes through Amboise; it passes at <I>a b c
d</I>, and when it has passed the bridge it turns back, against the
original current, by the channel <I>d e</I>, <I>b f</I> in contact with the
bank which lies between the two contrary currents of the said river,
<I>a b</I>, <I>c d</I>, and <I>d e</I>, <I>b f</I>. It then turns down again by the
channel <I>f l</I>, <I>g h</I>, <I>n m</I>, and reunites with the river from which
it was at first separated, which passes by <I>k n</I>, which makes <I>k m</I>,
<I>r t</I>. But when the river is very full it flows all in one channel
passing over the bank <I>b d</I>. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">590</FONT></A>

<P><A NAME="fn_256"></A><A HREF="1074.htm#fr_256">251:590</A> : See <A HREF="pl115.htm#img_pl115">Pl. CXV</A>. Lines 1-7 are
above, lines 8-10 in the middle of the large island and the word
<I>Isola</I> is written above <I>d</I> in the smaller island; <I>a</I> is written
on the margin on the bank of the river above 1. I; in the
reproduction it is not visible. As may be seen from the last
sentence, the observation was made after long study of the river's
course, when Leonardo had resided for some time at, or near,
Amboise.</P>
