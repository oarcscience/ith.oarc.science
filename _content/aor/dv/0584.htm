<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HOW AN ANGRY MAN IS TO BE FIGURED.</H3>
<P>
You must make an angry person holding someone by the hair, wrenching
his head against the ground, and with one knee on his ribs; his
right arm and fist raised on high. His hair must be thrown up, his
brow downcast and knit, his teeth clenched and the two corners of
his mouth grimly set; his neck swelled and bent forward as he leans
over his foe, and full of furrows.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HOW TO REPRESENT A MAN IN DESPAIR.</H3>
<P>
You must show a man in despair with a knife, having already torn
open his garments, and with one hand tearing open the wound. And
make him standing on his feet and his legs somewhat bent and his
whole person leaning towards the earth; his hair flying in disorder.
