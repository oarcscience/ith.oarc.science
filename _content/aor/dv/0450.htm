<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> The appearance of trees in the distance (450. 451).</FONT></span>The spaces between the parts in the mass of trees, and the spaces
between the trees in the air, are, at great distances, invisible to
the eye; for, where it is an effort [even] to see the whole it is
most difficult to discern the parts.--But a confused mixture is the
result, partaking chiefly of the [hue] which predominates. The
spaces between the leaves consist of particles of illuminated air
which are very much smaller than the tree and are lost sight of
sooner than the tree; but it does not therefore follow that they are
not there. Hence, necessarily, a compounded [effect] is produced of
the sky and of the shadows of the tree in shade, which both together
strike the eye which sees them.

<P>
That part of a tree will show the fewest spaces, behind which a
large number of trees are standing between the tree and the air
[sky]; thus in the tree <I>a</I> the spaces are not concealed nor in <I>b</I>,
as there is no tree behind. But in <I>c</I> only half shows the spaces
filled up by the tree <I>d</I>, and part of the tree <I>d</I> is filled up by
the tree <I>e</I> and a little farther on all the spaces in the mass of
the trees are lost, and only that at the side remains.
