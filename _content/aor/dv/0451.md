### 451.

### OF TREES.

What outlines are seen in trees at a distance against the sky which
serves as their background?

The outlines of the ramification of trees, where they lie against the
illuminated sky, display a form which more nearly approaches the
spherical on proportion as they are remote, and the nearer they are the
less they appear in this spherical form; as in the first tree *a* which,
being near to the eye,

<span id="img_v122700"></span> ![](img/v122700.jpg)

displays the true form of its ramification; but this shows less in *b*
and is altogether lost in *c*, where not merely the branches of the tree
cannot be seen but the whole tree is distinguished with difficulty.
Every object in shadow, of whatever form it may be, at a great distance
appears to be spherical. And this occurs because, if it is a square
body, at a very short distance it loses its angles, and a little farther
off it loses still more of its smaller sides which remain. And thus
before the whole is lost \[to sight\] the parts are lost, being smaller
than the whole; as a man, who in such a distant position loses his legs,
arms and head before \[the mass of\] his body, then the outlines of
length are lost before those of breadth, and where they have become
equal it would be a square if the angles remained; but as they are lost
it is round.
