The images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which
receives them; and all on every side in it. To prove this, let *a c e*
be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by the
small holes *n p* and thrown upon the plane *f i* opposite to these
holes. As many images will be produced in the chamber on the plane as
the number of the said holes.
