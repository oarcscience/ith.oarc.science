<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE AMPHISBOENA.</H3>
<P>
This has two heads, one in its proper place the other at the tail;
as if one place were not enough from which to fling its venom.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE IACULUS.</H3>
<P>
This lies on trees, and flings itself down like a dart, and pierces
through the wild beast and kills them.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE ASP.</H3>
<P>
The bite of this animal cannot be cured unless by immediately
cutting out the bitten part. This pestilential animal has such a
love for its mate that they always go in company. And if, by mishap,
one of them is killed the other, with incredible swiftness, follows
him who has killed it; and it is so determined and eager for
vengeance that it overcomes every difficulty, and passing by every
troop it seeks to hurt none but its enemy. And it will travel any
distance, and it is impossible to avoid it unless by crossing water
and by very swift flight. It has its eyes turned inwards, and large
ears and it hears better than it sees.
