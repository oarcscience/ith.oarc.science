<P>
Men will deal bitter blows to that which is the cause of their life.
(In thrashing Grain.)
<P>
The skins of animals will rouse men from their silence with great
outcries and curses. (Balls for playing Games.)
<P>
Very often a thing that is itself broken is the occasion of much
union. (That is the Comb made of split Cane which unites the threads
of Silk.)
<P>
The wind passing through the skins of animals will make men dance.
(That is the Bag-pipe, which makes people dance.)
