<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ALL BODIES, IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE NEARER TO, OR FARTHER FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT, WILL PRODUCE LONGER OR SHORTER DERIVED SHADOWS.</H3>
<P>
Among bodies of equal size, that one which is illuminated by the
largest light will have the shortest shadow. Experiment confirms
this proposition. Thus the body <I>m</I> <I>n</I> is surrounded by a larger
amount of light
<P><A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A></P>
<P>than the body <I>p q</I>, as is shown above. Let us say
that <I>v c a b d x</I> is the sky, the source of light, and that <I>s t</I>
is a window by which the luminous rays enter, and so <I>m n</I> and <I>p q</I>
are bodies in light and shade as exposed to this light; <I>m n</I> will
have a small derived shadow, because its original shadow will be
small; and the derivative light will be large, again, because the
original light <I>c d</I> will be large and <I>p q</I> will have more derived
shadow because its original shadow will be larger, and its derived
light will be smaller than that of the body <I>m n</I> because that
portion of the hemisphere <I>a b</I> which illuminates it is smaller than
the hemisphere <I>c d</I> which illuminates the body <I>m n</I>.
