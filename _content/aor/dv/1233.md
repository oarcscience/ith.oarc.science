*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1233.

### PRIDE.

The falcon, by reason of its haughtiness and pride, is fain to lord it
and rule over all the other birds of prey, and longs to be sole and
supreme; and very often the falcon has been seen to assault the eagle,
the Queen of birds.

### ABSTINENCE.

The wild ass, when it goes to the well to drink, and finds the water
troubled, is never so thirsty but that it will abstain from drinking,
and wait till the water is clear again.

### GLUTTONY.

The vulture is so addicted to gluttony that it will go a thousand miles
to eat a carrion \[carcase\]; therefore is it that it follows armies.
