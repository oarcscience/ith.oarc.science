*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 437.

### OF THE SHADOWS OF VERDURE.

The shadows of verdure are always somewhat blue, and so is every shadow
of every object; and they assume this hue more in proportion as they are
remote from the eye, and less in proportion as they are nearer.

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

The leaves which reflect the blue of the atmosphere always present
themselves to the eye edgewise.

### OF THE ILLUMINATED PART OF VERDURE AND OF MOUNTAINS.

The illuminated portion, at a great distance, will appear most nearly of
its natural colour where the strongest light falls upon it.
