<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE OPINION OF SOME THAT A TRIANGLE CASTS NO SHADOW ON A PLANE SURFACE.</H3>
<P>
<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> A disputed proposition.</FONT></span>Certain mathematicians have maintained that a triangle, of which the
base is turned to the light, casts no shadow on a plane; and this
they prove by saying [5] that no spherical body smaller than the
light can reach the middle with the shadow. The lines of radiant
light are straight lines [6]; therefore, suppose the light to be <I>g
h</I> and the triangle <I>l m n</I>, and let the plane be <I>i k</I>; they say
the light <I>g</I> falls on the side of the triangle <I>l n</I>, and the
portion of the plane <I>i q</I>. Thus again <I>h</I> like <I>g</I> falls on the
side <I>l m</I>, and then on <I>m n</I> and the plane <I>p k</I>; and if the whole
plane thus faces the lights <I>g h</I>, it is evident that the triangle
has no shadow; and that which has no shadow can cast none. This, in
this case appears credible. But if the triangle <I>n p g</I> were not
illuminated by the two lights <I>g</I> and <I>h</I>, but by <I>i p</I> and <I>g</I> and
<I>k</I> neither side is lighted by more than one single light: that is
<I>i p</I> is invisible to <I>h g</I> and <I>k</I> will never be lighted by <I>g</I>;
hence <I>p q</I> will be twice as light as the two visible portions that
are in shadow.
