### THE KIND OF LIGHT REQUISITE FOR PAINTING LIGHT AND SHADE.

An object will display the greatest difference of light and shade when
it is seen in the strongest light, as by sunlight, or, at night, by the
light of a fire. But this should not be much used in painting because
the works remain crude and ungraceful.

An object seen in a moderate light displays little difference in the
light and shade; and this is the case towards evening or when the day is
cloudy, and works then painted are tender and every kind of face becomes
graceful. Thus, in every thing extremes are to be avoided: Too much
light gives crudeness; too little prevents our seeing. The medium is
best.

### OF SMALL LIGHTS.

Again, lights cast from a small window give strong differences of light
and shade, all the more if the room lighted by it be large, and this is
not good for painting.
