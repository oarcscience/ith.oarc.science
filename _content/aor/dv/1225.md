*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1225.

### GENEROSITY.

It is said of the eagle that it is never so hungry but that it will
leave a part of its prey for the birds that are round it, which, being
unable to provide their own food, are necessarily dependent on the
eagle, since it is thus that they obtain food.

### DISCIPLINE.

When the wolf goes cunningly round some stable of cattle, and by
accident puts his foot in a trap, so that he makes a noise, he bites his
foot off to punish himself for his folly.
