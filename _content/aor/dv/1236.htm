<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE PELICAN.</H3>
<P>
This bird has a great love for its young; and when it finds them in
its nest dead from a serpent's bite, it pierces itself to the heart,
and with its blood it bathes them till they return to life.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SALAMANDER.</H3>
<P>
This has no digestive organs, and gets no food but from the fire, in
which it constantly renews its scaly skin.
<P>
The salamander, which renews its scaly skin in the fire,--for
virtue.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE CAMELEON.</H3>
<P>
This lives on air, and there it is the prey of all the birds; so in
order to be safer it flies above the clouds and finds an air so
rarefied that it cannot support the bird that follows it.
<P>
At that height nothing can go unless it has a gift from Heaven, and
that is where the chameleon flies.
