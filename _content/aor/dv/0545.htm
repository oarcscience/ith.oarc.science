<P>
If you cannot arrange that those who look at your work should stand
at one particular point, when constructing your work, stand back
until your eye is at least 20 times as far off as the greatest
height and width of your work. This will make so little difference
when the eye of the spectator moves, that it will be hardly
appreciable, and it will look very good.
<P>
If the point of sight is at <I>t</I> you would make the figures on the
circle <I>d b e</I> all
<P><A NAME="page_274"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 274</FONT></A></P>
<P>of one size, as each of them bears the same
relation to the point <I>t</I>. But consider the diagram given below and
you will see that this is wrong, and why I shall make <I>b</I> smaller
than <I>d e</I> &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">258</FONT></A>
.
<P>
It is easy to understand that if 2 objects equal to each other are
placed side by side the one at 3 braccia distance looks smaller than
that placed at 2 braccia. This however is rather theoretical than
for practice, because you stand close by &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">259</FONT></A>
.
<P>
All the objects in the foreground, whether large or small, are to be
drawn of their proper size, and if you see them from a distance they
will appear just as they ought, and if you see them close they will
diminish of themselves.
<P>
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">260</FONT></A>
 Take care that the vertical
plan on which you work out the perspective of the objects seen is of
the same form as the wall on which the work is to be executed.
