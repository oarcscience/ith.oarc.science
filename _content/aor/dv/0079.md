*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 79.

### OF THE CENTRAL LINE OF THE EYE.

<span id="img_v104801"></span> ![](img/v104801.jpg)

Only one line of the image, of all those that reach the visual virtue,
has no intersection; and this has no sensible dimensions because it is a
mathematical line which originates from a mathematical point, which has
no dimensions.

According to my adversary, necessity requires that the central line of
every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark chamber
shall be turned upside down, together with the images of the bodies that
surround it.
