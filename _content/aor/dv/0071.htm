pictures, intersecting

within the eye in the crystalline humour, is
seen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of
illuminated objects into a very dark chamber. Then, receive these
images on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near
to the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their
proper forms and colours, but much smaller; and they will be upside
down by reason of that very intersection. These images being
transmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually
painted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at
from behind. And let the little perforation be made in a very thin
plate of iron. Let <I>a b e d e</I> be the object illuminated by the sun
and <I>o r</I> the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at
<I>n m</I>. Let <I>s t</I> be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the
images of these objects upside down, because the rays being
straight, <I>a</I> on the right hand becomes <I>k</I> on the left, and <I>e</I> on
the left becomes <I>f</I> on the right; and the same takes place inside
the pupil.
