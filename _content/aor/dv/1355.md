*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1355.

This spirit returns to the brain whence it had departed, with a loud
voice and with these words, it moved...

And if any man though he may have wisdom or goodness .........

 <span id="fr_382"></span>[688](#fn_382)

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

O blessed and happy spirit whence comest thou? Well have I known this
man, much against my will. This one is a receptacle of villainy; he is a
perfect heap of the utmost ingratitude combined with every vice. But of
what use is it to fatigue myself with vain words? Nothing is to be found
in them but every form of sin ... And if there should be found among
them any that possesses any good, they will not be treated differently
to myself by other men; and in fine, I come to the conclusion that it is
bad if they are hostile, and worse if they are friendly.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_382"></span>[411:688](1355.htm#fr_382) : This passage, very
difficult to decipher, is on the reverse of a drawing at Windsor, [Pl.
CXXII](pl122.htm#img_pl122), which possibly has some connection with it.
The drawing is slightly reduced in this reproduction; the original being
25 cm. high by 19 cm. wide.
