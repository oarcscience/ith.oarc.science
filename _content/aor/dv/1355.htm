This spirit returns to the brain whence it had departed, with a loud
voice and with these words, it moved...
<P>
And if any man though he may have wisdom or goodness .........

<P>O blessed and happy spirit whence comest thou? Well have I known
this man, much against my will. This one is a receptacle of
villainy; he is a perfect heap of the utmost ingratitude combined
with every vice. But of what use is it to fatigue myself with vain
words? Nothing is to be found in them but every form of sin ... And
if there should be found among them any that possesses any good,
they will not be treated differently to myself by other men; and in
fine, I come to the conclusion that it is bad if they are hostile,
and worse if they are friendly.

<P><A NAME="fn_382"></A><A HREF="1355.htm#fr_382">411:688</A> : This passage, very difficult to decipher, is on the
reverse of a drawing at Windsor, <A HREF="pl122.htm#img_pl122">Pl. CXXII</A>, which possibly has some
connection with it. The drawing is slightly reduced in this
reproduction; the original being 25 cm. high by 19 cm. wide.</P>
