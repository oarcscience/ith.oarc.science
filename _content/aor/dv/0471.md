*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 471.

Describe landscapes with the wind, and the water, and the setting and
rising of the sun.

### THE WIND.

All the leaves which hung towards the earth by the bending of the shoots
with their branches, are turned up side down by the gusts of wind, and
here their perspective is reversed; for, if the tree is between you and
the quarter of the wind, the leaves which are towards you remain in
their natural aspect, while those on the opposite side which ought to
have their points in a contrary direction have, by being turned over,
their points turned towards you.
