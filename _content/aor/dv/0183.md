### 183.

<span class="margnote"> Further complications in the derived shadows
(183-187).</span>The greatest depth of shadow is in the simple derived
shadow because it is not lighted by either of the two lights *a b, c d*.

The next less deep shadow is the derived shadow *e f n*; and in this the
shadow is less by half, because it is illuminated by a single light,
that is *c d*.

This is uniform in natural tone because it is lighted throughout by one
only of the two luminous bodies \[10\]. But it varies with the
conditions of shadow, inasmuch as the farther it is away from the light
the less it is illuminated by it \[13\].

The third degree of depth is the middle shadow  <span
id="fr_88"></span>[86](#fn_88) . But this is not uniform in natural
tone; because the nearer it gets to the simple derived shadow the deeper
it is  <span id="fr_89"></span>[87](#fn_89) , and it is the uniformly
gradual diminution by increase of distance which is what modifies it
 <span id="fr_90"></span>[88](#fn_90) : that is to say the depth of a
shadow increases in proportion to the distance from the two lights.

The fourth is the shadow *k r s* and this is all the darker in natural
tone in proportion as it is nearer to *k s*, because it gets less of the
light *a o*, but by the accident \[of distance\] it is rendered less
deep, because it is nearer to the light *c d*, and thus is always
exposed to both lights.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

The fifth is less deep in shadow than either of the others because it is
always entirely exposed to one of the lights and to the whole or part of
the other; and it is less deep in proportion as it is nearer to the two
lights, and in proportion as it is turned towards the outer side *x t*;
because it is more exposed to the second light *a b*.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[102:86](0183.htm#fr_88) 15: We gather from what
follows that *q g r* here means *ombra media* (the middle shadow).

<span id="fn_89"></span>[102:87](0183.htm#fr_89) 18: Compare lines 10-13

<span id="fn_90"></span>[102:88](0183.htm#fr_90) 20: See Footnote 18

<span id="fn_91"></span>[103:89](0183.htm#fr_91) : The diagram to this
section is given on [Pl. V](pl005.htm#img_pl005). To the left is the
