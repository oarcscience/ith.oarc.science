*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1201.

Words which do not satisfy the ear of the hearer weary him or vex him,
and the symptoms of this you will often see in such hearers in their
frequent yawns; you therefore, who speak before men whose good will you
desire, when you see such an excess of fatigue, abridge your speech, or
change your discourse; and if you do otherwise, then instead of the
favour you desire, you will get dislike and hostility.

And if you would see in what a man takes pleasure, without hearing him
speak, change the subject of your discourse in talking to him, and when
you presently see him intent, without yawning or wrinkling his brow or
other actions of various kinds, you may be certain that the matter of
which you are speaking is such as is agreeable to him &c
