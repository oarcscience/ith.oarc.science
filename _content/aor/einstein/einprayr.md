*A child in the sixth grade in a Sunday School in New York City, with
the encouragement of her teacher, wrote to Einstein in Princeton on 19
January I936 asking him whether scientists pray, and if so what they
pray for. Einstein replied as follows on 24 January 1936:*

*In 1954 or 1955 Einstein received a letter citing a statement of his
and a seemingly contradictory statement by a noted evolutionist
concerning the place of intelligence in the Universe. Here is a
translation of the German draft of a reply. It is not known whether a
reply was actually sent:*

*The next excerpt is a letter written by Einstein in response to a
19-year-old Rutger's University student, who had written to Einstein of
his despair at seeing no visible purpose to life and no help from
religion.*

*In responding to this poignant cry for help, Einstein offered no easy
solace, and this very fact must have heartened the student and lightened
the lonely burden of his doubts. Here is Einstein's response. It was
written in English and sent from Princeton on 3 December 1950, within
days of receiving the letter:*

From p. 39

*On 17 July I953 a woman who was a licensed Baptist pastor sent Einstein
in Princeton a warmly appreciative evangelical letter. Quoting several
passages from the scriptures, she asked him whether he had considered
the relationship of his immortal soul to its Creator, and asked whether
he felt assurance of ever lasting life with God after death. It is not
known whether a reply was sent, but the letter is in the Einstein
Archives, and on it, in Einstein's hand writing, is the following
sentence, written in English:*

From p. 40

*In Berlin in February 1921 Einstein received from a woman in Vienna a
letter imploring him to tell her if he had formed an opinion as to
whether the soul exists and with it personal, individual development
after death. There were other questions of a similar sort. On 5 February
1921 Einstein answered at some length. Here in part is what he said:*

*On 22 March 1954 a self-made man sent Einstein in Princeton a long
handwritten letter-four closely packed pages in English. The
correspondent despaired that there were so few people like Einstein who
had the courage to speak out, and he wondered if it would not be best to
return the world to the animals. Saying "I presume you would like to
know who I am," he went on to tell in detail how he had come from Italy
to the United States at the age of nine, arriving in bitter cold
weather, as a result of which his sisters died while he barely survived;
how after six months of schooling he went to work at age ten; how at age
seventeen he went to Evening School; and so on, so that now he had a
regular job as an experimental machinist, had a spare-time business of
his own, and had some patents to his credit. He declared himself an
atheist. He said that real education came from reading books. He cited
an article about Einstein's religious beliefs and expressed doubts as to
the article's accuracy. He was irreverent about various aspects of
formal religion, speaking about the millions of people who prayed to God
in many languages, and remarking that God must have an enormous clerical
staff to keep track of all their sins. And he ended with a long
discussion of the social and political systems of Italy and the United
States that it would take too long to describe here. He also enclosed a
check for Einstein to give to charity.*

*On 24 March 1954 Einstein answered in English as follows:*

> I get hundreds and hundreds of letters but seldom one so interesting
> as yours. I believe that your opinions about our society are quite
> reasonable.
>
> It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions,
> a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a
> personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it
> clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it
> is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as
> our science can reveal it.
>
> I have no possibility to bring the money you sent me to the
> appropriate receiver. I return it therefore in recognition of your
> good heart and intention. Your letter shows me also that wisdom is not
> a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.

*There is in the Einstein Archives a letter dated 5 August 1927 from a
banker in Colorado to Einstein in Berlin. Since it begins "Several
months ago I wrote you as follows," one may assume that Einstein had not
yet answered. The banker remarked that most scientists and the like had
given up the idea of God as a bearded, benevolent father figure
surrounded by angels, although many sincere people worship and revere
such a God. The question of God had arisen in the course of a discussion
in a literary group, and some of the members decided to ask eminent men
to send their views in a form that would be suitable for publication. He
added that some twenty-four Nobel Prize winners had already responded,
and he hoped that Einstein would too. On the letter, Einstein wrote the
following in German. It may or may not have been sent:*

> I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the
> actions of individuals, or would directly sit in judgment on creatures
> of his own creation. I cannot do this in spite of the fact that
> mechanistic causality has, to a certain extent, been placed in doubt
> by modern science.
>
> My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely
> superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our
> weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality. Morality
> is of the highest importance-but for us, not for God.

From pp. 69-70

*A Chicago Rabbi, preparing a lecture on "The Religious Implications of
the Theory of Relativity," wrote to Einstein in Princeton on zo December
1939 to ask some questions on the topic. Einstein replied as follows:*

> I do not believe that the basic ideas of the theory of relativity can
> lay claim to a relationship with the religious sphere that is
> different from that of scientific knowledge in general. I see this
> connection in the fact that profound interrelationships in the
> objective world can Ije comprehended through simple logical concepts.
> To be sure, in the theory of relativity this is the case in
> particularly full measure.
>
> The religious feeling engendered by experiencing the logical
> comprehensibility of profound interrelations is of a somewhat
> different sort from the feeling that one usually calls religious. It
> is more a feeling of awe at the scheme that is manifested in the
> material universe. It does not lead us to take the step of fashioning
> a god-like being in our own image-a personage who makes demands of us
> and who takes an interest in us as individuals. There is in this
> neither a will nor a goal, nor a must, but only sheer being. For this
> reason, people of our type see in morality a purely human matter,
> albeit the most important in the human sphere.
