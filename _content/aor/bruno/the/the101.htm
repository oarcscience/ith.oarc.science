</p>  <h1 align="center">PREFACE.</h1>  
<p>WHEN this Translation was begun, more than two years ago, for my own pleasure, in leisure hours, I had no knowledge of the difficulty I should find in the work, nor any thought of ever having it printed; but as "Gli Eroici Furori" of Giordano Bruno has never appeared in English, I decided to publish that portion of it which I have finished.</p>  
<p>I wish to thank those friends who have so kindly looked over my work from time to time, and given me their help in the choice of words and phrases. I must, moreover, confess that I am keenly alive to the shortcomings and defects of this Translation.</p>  
<p>I have used the word "Enthusiasts" in the title, rather than "Enthusiasms," because it seemed tome more appropriate.</p>
