# THE APOLOGY OF THE NOLAN

### TO THE MOST VIRTUOUS AND LOVELY LADIES.

O LOVELY, graceful nymphs of England!  
Not in repugnance nor in scorn,  
Our spirit holds you, Nor would our pen abase you  
More than it must--to call you feminine!  
Exemption I am sure you would not claim  
Being subject to the common influence;  
Shining on earth as do the stars in heaven.  
Your sov'reign beauty, ladies, our austerity  
Cannot depreciate, nor would do so,  
For we have not in view a superhuman kind.  
Such poison, <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7) therefore, far from you
be set,  
For here we see the one, the great Diana,  
Who is to you as sun amongst the stars.  
Wit, words, learning and art,  
And whatsoe'er is mine of scribbling faculty,  
I humbly place before you.
