### ORTHODOX RELIGION DYING OUT.

It gives me immense pleasure to say to this audience that orthodox
religion is dying out of the civilized world. It is a sick man. It has
been attacked with two diseases--softening of the brain and ossification
of the heart. It is a religion that no longer satisfies the intelligence
of this country; that no longer satisfies the brain; a religion against
which the heart of every civilized man and woman protests. It is a
religion that gives hope only to a few; that puts a shadow upon the
cradle; that wraps the coffin in darkness and fills the future of
mankind with flame and fear. It is a religion that I am going to do what
little I can while I live to destroy. In its place I want humanity, I
want good fellowship, I want intellectual liberty--free lips, the
discoveries and inventions of genius, the demonstrations of science--the
religion of art, music and poetry--of good houses, good clothes, good
wages--that is to say, the religion of this world.
