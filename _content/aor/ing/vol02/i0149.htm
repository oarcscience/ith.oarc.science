<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE LOVE OF GOD.</H3>
<P>What is the next thing I find in this creed?</P>
<P>"We believe that man was made in the image of God, that he might know, love, and obey God, and enjoy him forever."</P>
<P>I do not believe that anybody ever did love God, because nobody ever knew anything about him. We love each other. We love something that we know. We love something that our experience tells us is good and great and beautiful. We cannot by any possibility love the unknown. We can love truth, because truth adds to human happiness. We can love justice, because it preserves human joy. We can love charity. We can love every form of goodness that we know, or of which we can conceive, but we cannot love the infinitely unknown. And how can we be made in the image of something that has neither body, parts, nor passions?</P>
