<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE CREEDS.</H3>
<P>Often, after having delivered a lecture, I have met some good, religious person who has said to me:</P>
<P>"You do not tell it as we believe it."</P>
<P>"Well, but I tell it as you have it written in your creed."</P>
<P>"Oh, we don't mind the creed any more."</P>
<P>"Then, why do you not change it?"</P>
<P>"Oh, well, we understand it as it is, and if we tried to change it, maybe we would not agree."</P>
<P>Possibly the creeds are in the best condition now. There is a tacit understanding that they do not believe them, that there is a way to get around them, and that they can read between the lines; that if they should meet now to form new creeds they would fail to agree; and that now they can say as they please, except in public. Whenever they do so in public the church, in self-defence, must try them; and I believe in trying every minister that does not preach the doctrine he agrees to. I have not the slightest sympathy with a Presbyterian preacher who endeavors to preach infidelity from a Presbyterian pulpit and receives Presbyterian money. When he changes his views he should step down and out like a man, and say, "I do not believe your doctrine, and I will not preach it. You must hire some other man.</P>
