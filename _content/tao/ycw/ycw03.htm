<P>The Lord says:&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw04.htm#xref_CC1"><FONT SIZE="1">CC1</FONT></A></P>
<P>For seventeen generations I have been incarnated&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_1"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as a high mandarin, and I have never oppressed my people nor maltreated my subordinates. I have helped them in misfortune; I have rescued them from poverty; I have taken compassion on their orphans; I have forgiven their transgressions; I have extensively practised secret virtue (<I>yin chih</I> &nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_2"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>) which is attuned to heaven above.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw04.htm#xref_CC2"><FONT SIZE="1">CC2</FONT></A> If you are able to keep your hearts as I have kept mine, Heaven will surely bestow upon you blessings. Therefore, these are the instructions I declare unto mankind:&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_3"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></P>
<P>He who wants to expand the field of happiness,&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_4"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> let him lay the foundation of it on the bottom of his heart.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw04.htm#xref_CC7"><FONT SIZE="1">CC7</FONT></A></P>
<P>Practise benevolence&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_5"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> wherever you find an opportunity, and let your deeds of merit be unheeded (<I>yin</I>).</P>
<P>Benefit all creatures&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_6"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>; benefit the people.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw04.htm#xref_CC8"><FONT SIZE="1">CC8</FONT></A></P>
<P><A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A></P>
<P>Practise goodness: acquire merit.</P>
<P>Be honest like Heaven in conducting your affairs.</P>
<P>Compassionate and auspicious, the state government must be devoted to the salvation of the people.</P>
<P>Let your heart be impartial&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_7"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and wide of range.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw04.htm#xref_CC9"><FONT SIZE="1">CC9</FONT></A></P>
<P>Fulfil the four obligations&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_8"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>; impartially observe the three doctrines.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_9"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></P>
<P>Be faithful and reverential to the ruler. Be filial and obedient to parents.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw04.htm#xref_CC10"><FONT SIZE="1">CC10</FONT></A> Be congenial and friendly to brothers. Be sincere in your intercourse with friends.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_10"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></P>
<P>Let some worship the Truthful One,&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_11"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> and revere the Northern Constellation, while others bow before the Buddha and recite sutras.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw04.htm#xref_CC12"><FONT SIZE="1">CC12</FONT></A></P>
<P>By discoursing on morality and righteousness, convert both the cunning and the dull. By preaching on the canonical books and histories, enlighten the ignorant and the benighted.</P>
<P>Relieve people in distress as speedily as you must release a fish from a dry rill [lest he die]. Deliver people from danger as quickly as you must free a sparrow from a tight noose.</P>
<P>Be compassionate to orphans and relieve widows. Respect the old and help the poor.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A></P>
<P>Promote the good and recommend the wise. Be lenient with others and exacting with yourself.</P>
<P>Save your clothing and provisions that ye may befriend the hungry and cold on the road.</P>
<P>Give away coffins and cases lest the dead of the poor be exposed.</P>
<P>Build charitable graveyards for unclaimed corpses.</P>
<P>Establish philanthropic institutions for the education of children.</P>
<P>If your own family is well provided, extend a helping hand to your relatives. If the harvest fails, provide for and relieve your neighbors and friends.</P>
<P>Let measures and scales be accurate; and be neither chary in selling nor exacting in buying.</P>
<P>Treat your servants with generosity and consideration. Do not expect perfection nor be too strict in your demands.</P>
<P>Publish and make known sutras&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_12"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> and tracts. Build and repair temples and shrines.</P>
<P>Distribute medicine to alleviate the suffering of the sick. With tea or water relieve the distress of the thirsty.</P>
<P>Light lanterns in the night to illuminate where people walk. Keep boats on rivers to ferry people across.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A></P>
<P>Buy captive animals and give them freedom.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_13"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw04.htm#xref_CC13"><FONT SIZE="1">CC13</FONT></A></P>
<P>How commendable is abstinence&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_14"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> that dispenses with the butcher!</P>
<P>While walking be mindful of worms and ants.</P>
<P>Be cautious with fire and do not set mountain woods or forests ablaze.</P>
<P>Do not go into the mountain to catch birds in nets,&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_15"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> nor to the water to poison fishes and minnows.</P>
<P>Do not butcher the ox that plows thy field.</P>
<P>Do not throw away paper that is written on.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_16"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></P>
<P>Do not scheme for others' property.</P>
<P>Do not envy others' accomplishments.</P>
<P>Do not approach thy neighbor's wife or maids.</P>
<P>Do not stir thy neighbors to litigation.</P>
<P>Do not injure thy neighbor's reputation or interest.</P>
<P>Do not meddle with thy neighbor's conjugal affairs.</P>
<P>Set not, for personal malice, brothers at variance with one another.</P>
<P>Set not father and son at variance for trifles.</P>
<P>Never take advantage of your power, nor disgrace the good and law-abiding.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A></P>
<P>Presume not, ye that are rich; nor deceive the needy and suffering.</P>
<P>While attending to your duty,&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_17"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> be humble and modest.</P>
<P>Live in concord with your relatives and clansmen.</P>
<P>Let go hatred&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_18"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> and forgive malice.</P>
<P>Those that are good, seek ye for friends; that will help you to practise virtue with body and soul. Those that are wicked, keep at a distance; it will prevent evil from approaching you.</P>
<P>Pass in silence over things wicked, but promulgate all that is good.</P>
<P>Do not assert with your mouth what your heart denies.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21:1"></A><A HREF="#fn_21:1"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>Always have in mind helpful sayings.</P>
<P>Do not use improper language.</P>
<P>Cut the brambles and thorns that obstruct the highway. Remove bricks and stones that lie in the path.</P>
<P>Repair the defiles though for many hundred years they have remained unimproved.</P>
<P>Build bridges to be traversed by thousands and ten thousands of people.</P>
<P></P>
<P><A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A></P>
<P>Expound moral maxims to correct the people's faults.</P>
<P>Supply the means to give instruction to people of talent.</P>
<P>Let your work conform to Heaven's reason,&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw04.htm#xref_CC14"><FONT SIZE="1">CC14</FONT></A> and let your speech express humaneness.</P>
<P>Keep the ancient sages before your eyes even when at supper or while looking over the fence.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_19"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></P>
<P>Be mindful when you are alone&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_14"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> in the shadow of your coverlet.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_20"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></P>
<P>Anything evil refrain ye from doing;&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw04.htm#xref_CC14"><FONT SIZE="1">CC14</FONT></A> all good deeds do!&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_21"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A> So will you be released forever from the influence of evil stars, and always be encompassed by good guardian angels.&nbsp;<A HREF="ycw05.htm#xref_22"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></P>
<P>Rewards may be immediate, and you will receive them in person, or rewards may be remote, and will devolve upon your posterity.</P>
<P>Blessings come a hundredfold in loads as if drawn by horses; good fortune is piled up a thousandfold like a mass of clouds.</P>
<P>Do not all these things accrue to the heart of the quiet way?</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_21:1"></A><A HREF="#fr_21:1">21:1</A> This recalls the fact that in Babylon "to say 'Yea' with the mouth, and 'nay' with the heart . . . was repeatedly branded as a sin."
