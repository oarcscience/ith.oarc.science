This is a small selection of varied texts from the Taoist Canon,
including yet another translation of the Tao Te Ching. As intimated in
the subtitle, some of the books relate to ethics, some to politics, and
some to internal alchemy. Selections marked with an \* are not
translated in Legge's [*Texts of Taoism*](../sbe40/index), and are thus
believed to be new to the internet here. The English translations of the
titles shown below are given in the text, but only on the headers of the
pages. There are in the original moderately extensive notes in Chinese,
but the characters have all been replaced with \#\#\# in this edition in
the interest of saving bandwidth, resulting in some notes which are now
absurdly meaningless.
