<HR WIDTH="10%" ALIGN="center">

<P>I<SMALL>T</SMALL> is only after some years of hesitation that I have undertaken a new version of the Tao T&ecirc; Ching. The task has already been performed by Julien, Chalmers, Strauss, Pl&auml;nckner, and Legge, most of whom, at any rate, are scholars of the first water. But it occurs to me&#8212;and with all deference I make the avowal&#8212;that one prime defect lies at the root of every translation that has been published hitherto; and this is, that not one seems to have been based solely and entirely on commentaries furnished by members of the Taoist school. The Confucian element enters largely into all; and here, I think, an injustice has been done to Lao Tsze. To a Confucianist, the Taoist system is in every sense of the word a heresy, and a commentator holding this opinion is surely not the best expositor. It is as a grammarian rather than as a philosopher that a member of the Ju-chia deals with the Tao T&ecirc; Ching; he gives the sense of a passage according to the syntactical construction rather than according to the genius of the philosophy itself; and in attempting to explain the text by his own canons instead of by the canons of Taoism, he mistakes the superficial and apparently obvious meaning for the hidden and esoteric interpretation. One of the greatest reproaches levelled at the Taoist system by Confucian scholars is the alleged scorn of ethical morality attributed to Lao Tsze and his followers. They have been represented as ascribing all the troubles and vices of China to the example of Yao and Shun, and to the doctrines respecting benevolence, rectitude, ceremonies, and music enforced by the Sages who immediately succeeded them. L&uuml; Tsu, in his commentary, vehemently controverts this theory, and strives to prove, not only that Taoism and Confucianism are at one upon such points, but that <I>the latter is actually based upon the former</I>&#8212;being a mere carrying-out in practice, a careful systematising, as it were, of the radical doctrines of Lao Ch&uuml;n. The fact that I have entirely discarded all assistance from commentators of the Confucian school is my only excuse for coming forward with a new translation of this important classic. The version now presented is based solely upon the commentaries of L&uuml; Ch&#8216;un-yang, commonly called L&uuml; Tsu, the well-known Taoist patriarch of the eighth century of our era; and his guidance I have followed throughout. I candidly admit that this has not been done without some effort. It was no means easy, at first, to reject what appeared

to be the plain, clear, unmistakeable meaning of the text&#8212;a meaning, too, endorsed by many eminent Chinese scholars, such as Chu Hsi, Liu Chieh-fu, Wang Pi, and Su Tsze-yu, and adopted by Legge, Julien, and Chalmers&#8212;in favour of an interpretation at once far-fetched and obscure. But I felt that I was after all under the guidance of a disciple, and not a critic, of the Master; and although many passages which before stood out distinctly enough are now dimmed by mysticism, I cannot help thinking that we have advanced a step towards the comprehension of their true significance. There are other passages the existing translations of which, apart from questions of commentary, I believe to be entirely, and indeed palpably, wrong, and of these I now offer a new rendering with confidence. The versions of Julien and Chalmers have lain beside me, and I have constantly referred to them; but far from relying on them for assistance, each glance has shown me how wide and radical was the divergence between them and the work growing slowly but steadily under my hand.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need only add that the words enclosed in brackets [thus] are for the most part representative of the commentary I have followed, and thus serve to supplement the meagre and laconic text. Occasionally a few lines of additional elucidation or remark have been appended, where necessary, in smaller type.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>, or Principle of Nature, may be discussed [by all]; it is not the popular or common Tao&#8212;[<I>e.g.</I>, the <I>tao-li</I> of ethics, dealing with the ### and the ###].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its Name may be named [<I>i.e.</I>, the T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> may receive a designation, though of itself it has none]; but it is not an ordinary name, [or name in the usual sense of the word, for it is a presentment or &#949;&#953;&#948;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#957; of the Infinite].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its nameless period was that which preceded the birth of the Universe, [the ###];</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In being spoken of by name, it is as the Progenitrix of All Things, [the period of the ###, which divided and produced the ###].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore in habitual passionlessness [the ### or Quiescent phase of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>] that its mystery may be scanned; and in habitual desire [the ### or Active phase of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>] that its developments may be perceived.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two conditions, the Active and the Quiescent, alike proceed [from T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>]; it is only in name that they differ. Both may be called profundities; and the depth of profundity is the gate of every mystery.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beautiful being once recognised as such by the world, the Repulsive appears [as its converse]. Goodness being once recognised as such, Evil appears in like manner. Thus existence and non-existence produce each other; the difficult and the easy bring about each other; the long and the short impart form to each other; the high and low comply [or change places] with each other; sounds and voices harmonise with each other; priority and sequence alternate with each other.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore the Sage pursues a policy of inaction, and teaches men in silence; [<I>i.e.</I>, he conforms to the T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> or Course of Nature, which proceeds silently and spontaneously, and thus the people learn to govern themselves by his example without needing the interferences of legislation and instruction].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forms all things without shrinking [from the labour]; produces them without claiming the possession [of virtue]; acts without presuming on [his ability]; and completes his achievements without taking any credit to himself. It is only he who thus does not stand upon his merit; and therefore his merit does not depart from him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The Sage], by not showing exclusive approval of those who are eminent in virtue, prevents the people from quarrelling; by not setting high store on things difficult to obtain, he prevents the people from becoming robbers; by closing his eyes to objects of desire, he secures his heart from corruption. Wherefore the Sage, in governing, does so with a heart empty [of all distractions and temptations], but a bosom full [of justice and benevolence]; he makes his will pliant, his bodily frame-work firm; he ever keeps the people from [harmful] knowledge and desires, and prevents those who have such knowledge from daring to put it into practice. He pursues a policy of inaction, and there is therefore nothing that is left ungoverned.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> is full [<I>q.d.</I>, exhaustless and complete]; yet in operation as though not self-elated. In its origin it is as it were the Ancestor of All Things. It chastens asperity; it unravels confusion; it moderates the radiance [proceeding from those in whom T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> is embodied&#8212;see <I>Chuang Tsze</I>, 'K&ecirc;ng-sang Ch&#8216;u']; and it identifies itself with the sordid ones of the earth [the "dust" or common people&#8212;see <I>Mencius</I>, Book V, chap. 1, sec. 3; <I>q.d.</I>, it enables a man to associate with the base without being defiled]. Pellucid [as a spreading ocean] it yet has the semblance of permanence. I know not whose offspring it is. Its &#949;&#953;&#948;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#957; existed before God was.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Heaven and Earth were not benevolent, they would regard creation in the light of grass [which is worthless] and dogs [which are killed]. If the Sage were not benevolent, he would likewise regard the people in the light of grass and dogs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space between Heaven and Earth may be compared to a leathern bag, or box; [a receptacle with Heaven for a lid and Earth for a floor]. It is a vacuum [outside which there is nothing], exercising no pressure [on that which is within]; the more it moves, the more prolific it is. Those who talk too much will often come to an end of their words. It is better to maintain rectitude [inwardly].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit of the Depths is immortal; it is called the Azure [Heaven] and the Mother [Earth]. The passage through which these Two Influences [###] emerge and enter is called the root [or <I>nidus</I>] of the visible creation. They are ceaseless in action as though permanent, and may be drawn upon [used, or laid under contribution] without ever being exhausted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven is everlasting; Earth endures. The reason of the endurance of Heaven and Earth is that they were not self-produced. Therefore it is that they are able to endure for ever. Thus, though the Sage [in imitation of them] regards the cultivation of his body as of secondary importance, his body still progresses [of its own accord]; he discards his body, and yet his body is preserved. Is not this because he has no selfishness? Wherefore he is able to realise all his wishes [in carrying out the principles of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> in his own person].</P>

<HR WIDTH="10%" ALIGN="center">

<H3 ALIGN="center">VIII.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goodness of the Ruler resembles water [in pliancy, adaptability, and fertilising power]. The goodness of water is beneficial to all things, and that without struggling.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abiding-place [of the Imperial goodness] is despised by the multitude [for it is lowly&#8212;referring to the downward course of water]; and therefore it is near to T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>. Wherever it dwells, it sanctifies the spot. In the heart, its sanctifying properties are unfathomable. In bestowing, it sanctifies benevolence; in speaking, it sanctifies trustworthiness; in administration, it sanctifies government; in the fulfilment of daily work, it sanctifies ability; in the adoption of public measures it sanctifies acting seasonably. It alone never strives against [or places itself in opposition to] anyone; and therefore it gives rise to no resentful feelings.</P>

<HR WIDTH="10%" ALIGN="center">

<H3 ALIGN="center">IX.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to desist altogether, than, having once grasped [the T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>], to pride oneself on one's self-sufficiency. Research, if carried on to too

keen a point, prevents the preservation of the body [<I>q.d.</I>, hastens death]. When a hall is filled up with gold and jewels, it cannot be guarded intact. When wealth and honours are combined with arrogance, they themselves invoke calamity. To keep oneself in the background when merit has been achieved and fame has followed in its wake; this is the way of Heaven.</P>

<HR WIDTH="10%" ALIGN="center">

<H3 ALIGN="center">X.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having received, in the birth-process, a living soul, one is able, by preserving its individuality [pure and uncorrupted], to prevent disunion [with the pure original]. By controlling the vital force, and bringing it to the utmost degre'e of pliancy, one is able to become as a little child again&#8212;[revert to one's pristine state of innocence]. By washing and cleansing oneself of that which Heaven alone can see [<I>i.e.</I>, secret sins], one may become without one blemish. By governing the Empire by love towards the people, one is able to keep them from knowing [evil; they will live in an atmosphere of contentment and trust].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Door of Heaven is now open, now closed, then the Female Principle will disappear; [all will be pure Yang].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>*&#8270;* The Commentator points out that this is the Door of Virtue, through which men are permitted by Heaven to pass to and fro; and these will be assimilated with the Yang in all its purity, which is dominated by ###. The admixture of Yin and Yang in a man's heart leads to disturbance, and is therefore to be avoided. The opening and closing of the Door are to be understood as signifying ### and ### respectively.</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one's understanding reaches in every direction, he can disregard knowledge [as such; there will be no such thing, to him, as ignorance]. What he produces, he nourishes. Producing, he does not claim the possession [of virtue]; acting, he does not presume upon [his ability]. Though he be a veteran among his fellows, he assumes no seignory over them. This may be called Sublime Virtue&#8212;[the highest development of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty spokes, uniting in a nave, were employed [in olden times] before the invention of carriages. Clay made into utensils was employed before the time of palaces and dwellings [when there were no sacrificial vases, goblets, or bowls]. A door and a window, hewn [in a hill-side], did duty for a residence before the erection of houses. Wherefore, the possession of these things may be regarded as beneficial, while their [former] absence may be said to have been useful [in that it led to the necessity of their being made].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five colours blind the eyes of men. The five tones deafen their ears. The five flavours vitiate their palates. Galloping and hunting induce derangement of the mind. Objects that are difficult of attainment lead them to incur obstacles, [or injury&#8212;in their pursuit].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Sage cares for his inner self, and not for that which his eye can see; for which reason he discards the latter and preserves the former.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Favour and disgrace are alike a cause of fear. Honours bring great calamity upon the body.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it that one calls favour and disgrace? Disgrace implies downfal; the loss of one and subjection to the other, are equally causes of apprehension. Therefore it may be said that favour and disgrace both give rise to fear.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is meant by saying that honours bring calamity upon the body? The calamities which come upon me are the consequence of my possessing a body; had I none, what calamities could I incur?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore, if the honours which come upon me personally are on account of my position as a ruler, then the whole Empire will subject itself to me; and those who cultivate personal benevolence in ruling may commit themselves to the Empire for ever.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That which may be looked for, but proves invisible, is called the Distant. That which may be listened for, but proves inaudible, is called Vacancy. That which may be clutched at, but proves intangible, is called the Subtle. Words are inadequate thoroughly to examine these three properties; therefore they blend together and become One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dim. Continuous in endurance, it cannot be named. In reverting to vacuity it may be called the Form of Formlessness, the Image of the Non-existent; for which reasons it is unsearchable.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing opposite to it, one cannot see its head [front]; following it, one cannot perceive its back [or foot-prints].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtaining the T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> of ancient times, and applying it as an aid to the methods in vogue at the present day, so that one is able to arrive at a knowledge of its long-past origin, may be called [getting] the Germ, or Clue, of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> of] those eminent for wisdom in the olden times was subtle, mysterious, recondite, and penetrating; its depths were uncognizable by others. These, [the non-adepts], being unable to learn it, strove by main force, therefore, to act it out in practice. They endured [the hardships of their search] as those who ford streams in the winter. Cautious were they, as those who dread [the ridicule of] their neighbours; reverent were they, as those who entertain a visitor; expansive were they, as ice on the point of melting; simple and unpolished were they, as unhewn wood; vacant were they, as a ravine; undiscerning were they, as turbid water.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is able to make turbid water grow gradually clear by reducing it to quiescence? Who is able to impart [unending] life to that which is at rest by setting it in perpetual motion? Those who preserve this T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> desire no fulness; wherefore, having no fulness, they are able to guard it in their hearts for ever and it never requires to be renewed.</P>

<HR WIDTH="10%" ALIGN="center">

<H3 ALIGN="center">XVI.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the extreme of emptiness is reached [as by Heaven], and quiescence rigidly preserved [as by Earth], then all things are simultaneously produced; and by this [example] I observe their revolutions. All things, after flourishing like the herb <I>y&uuml;n</I>, return each to what it sprang from. Returning to this source is called quiescence,

<A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A>

and this implies a reversion to the original ordinance [of Heaven]. Reversion to the original ordinance [of Heaven] is called the basis or pivot [###] of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>. Knowledge of this may be called enlightenment, while ignorance of it leads to a reckless working-out of one's own ruin. He who knows it, bears with others. Bearing with others, he is just; being just, he is fit to be a king; being a king, he is the associate of Heaven [whose decree he holds and whose ordinancee he carries out]. Heaven is [the offspring of] T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>; and T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> survives the death of him who is the embodiment of it, living on unharmed for ever.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">XVII.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of pre&euml;minent wisdom and purity knew [this T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>] intuitively from their birth, and so possessed it. Those of the second rank&#8212;the men of virtue&#8212;approached it nearly, and eulogised it. Those of the third rank&#8212;who were still above the commonalty&#8212;stood in awe of it. Those of the lowest rank held it in light esteem. Their belief in it was superficial, or imperfect; while there were even some who did not believe in it at all.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The first] spoke only with forethought and calculation, as though honouring their words. When their [public] labours were achieved, and affairs progressed unimpeded, the people all said, "This is our natural and spontaneous condition."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Great T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> [of the Five Rulers and the Three Dynasties] fell into disuse, Benevolence and Rectitude appeared.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>*&#8270;* This refers to the rise of ethical science under the Sages&#8212;a substitute for the silent guidance of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>. under which the golden age of China had been passed.</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men of wisdom and kindness came forth, and then hypocrisy began to spread&#8212;[good men were counterfeited by the base]. Discord arose

<A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A>

in families, and this manifested [by contrast] the virtues of filial piety and compassion. The State was thrown into anarchy, and this led to the appearance of faithful Ministers.</P>

<HR WIDTH="10%" ALIGN="center">

<H3 ALIGN="center">XIX.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sages are rejected as rulers, and the services of the wise are discarded, the people's wealth will increase a hundredfold; [for their hearts will all be set on covetousness]. When benevolence and rectitude [in government] are abjured, [such will be the height of disorder that] the people will revert to their natural qualities of filial piety and compassion [by sheer force of reaction]. When ingenuities of luxury and eagerness for gain are renounced, there will be no more robbers&#8212;[for there will be no accumulations of wealth to be worth stealing]. These three propositions show that mere externals are insufficient for good government, and therefore each man should be ordered to confine himself to performing his own special work in life.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>*&#8270;* It is evident, from the forced interpretation of the above sentences, that the Commentator has expended all his ingenuity in an attempt to clear Lao Tsze from the imputation of reviling the Sages and repudiating ethical morality. How far he has succeeded, those who are familiar with the Confucianist expositors are able to judge for themselves.</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By looking always on the reality of things, and preserving the simple truth, [the people] will become less selfish and have fewer desires; and by pursuing their researches [into the Doctrine] to the utmost limit, they may avoid sorrow.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How small is the distance dividing a prompt affirmative from a sycophantic acquiescence; [yet] how great is that between virtue and immorality! I cannot but fear that which is feared by others. [Their scholarship], how neglected is it! It is still night with them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is joyful and merry as on a day of sacrifice, or as those who mount a belvedere in spring-time. I alone prefer solitude and quiet, and seek not to pry into futurity. I am like an infant ere it has grown to be a child; listlessly I roam hither and thither, as though I had no home to go to. The multitude have abundance and to spare; I alone am like one who has relinquished everything. Have I, therefore, the heart of a fool? Confused and dim, while the vulgar are [apparently] enlightened; I alone am in the dark. Tossed to and fro, like the sea; roving without cessation.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of Virtue in its fullest exuberance is no more than the result of compliance with the T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>. T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>, considered as an entity, is obscure and vague. Vague and obscure! yet within it there is Form. Obscure and vague! yet within it there is Substance. Vacuous and unfathomable! yet within it there is Quintessential Energy&#8212;and this is supremely real. Within it, too, there is Trustworthiness; from ancient down to modern times its name has never been lost; by it I can include in the range of my observation the whole of animate nature. How am I cognisant of the acquiescence of animate nature [in T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>]?&#8212;By T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> itself.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In cultivating T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>] there are first the sprouts; then perfection. First, there is perversion; then rectification. First there is hollowness [receptivity]; then plenitude. First there is destruction [of the old]; then renovation. First there is humility; then acquisition. Self-sufficiency is followed by suspicion [on the part of others]. Therefore the Sage preserves unity [in his heart] and becomes a pattern to the whole world. He does not say himself that he can see, and therefore he is perspicacious. He does not say himself that he is right, and therefore he is manifested to all. He does pot praise himself, and therefore his merit is recognised. He is not self-conceited, and therefore he increases [in knowledge]. And as he never strives with anybody, so the world does not strive with him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who become thus identified with T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> are also received joyfully by those who already possess the T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was Something formed from chaos, which came into being before Heaven and Earth. Silent and boundless it stands alone, and never changes. It pervades every place, and incurs no danger [of being impaired]. It may be called the Mother of the Universe. I know not its name; but its designation is T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>. If forced to call it something, I will call it great. Being great, it moves ever onward; and thus I say that it is remote. Being remote, I say that it returns.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the King also is great. In the Universe there are four things that are great, and the King is one of them. Man regulates himself by the Earth; Earth regulates itself by Heaven; Heaven regulates itseIf by T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>; and T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> regulates itseIf by its own inherent nature&#8212;or, spontaneously.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weighty is the source of the light; stillness dominates disquietude. Wherefore, while the Sage proceeds the whole day [according to T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>], he never departs from either calmness or gravity. Although there may be spectacles of worldly glory [to attract him] he sits quietly alone, far above the common crowd. How is that a Prince of Ten Thousand Studs of Horses can regard his own person as of less importance than his regal dignity?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lightness [on the part of the Prince] loses him his Ministers, while restlessness [on the part of the Ministers] loses them their Prince.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>*&#8270;* The phrase ### might well be rendered "is the ruin of their Prince;" but this is not sanctioned by L&uuml; Ts&ucirc;, who interprets it as meaning that such Ministers will be dismissed.</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct of the virtuous leaves neither trace nor clue. The words of the virtuous afford no ground for fault-finding. The projects of the virtuous require no intrigue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the virtuous are obstructed [in their policy], though there be no bolt to the door which shuts them in, it yet cannot be opened. When the virtuous enter into relations with others, though they be not bound by the ties of contract, they yet may not release themselves [from their obligations].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Sage ever uses his goodness in saving others; and therefore there are none who are abandoned. He ever uses his goodness in saving the inanimate creation; and therefore there are none of these who are abandoned. This is called being doubly enlightened.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore the virtuous man is the teacher, or patron, of the bad man, while the bad man is employed as material, on which to work, by the virtuous man. If the bad man does not reverence the other as his teacher, nor the good man love the former as his material; then, in spite of any wisdom either may possess, they are both greatly blinded.

The idea of the Commentator, which is exceedingly difficult to catch, is that the man who embraces the simplicity of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>, referred to in the previous chapter, should, to be consistent, have nothing to do with the pomp and trappings of Imperial state. It is true that the rendering of ### by "used" is a liberty, and the idea apparently is that in the reign of such an Emperor as Lao Tsze is supposing such things should not even be made.</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who make them will break them; those who clutch at them will lose them. For among the things of the world there are those who lead and those who follow; there are ejaculations of grief and ejaculations of gladness; there are those who are strong and those who are weak; there are those who sustain loads and those who are good for nothing. For this reason the Sage puts away excess, display, and pride.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who use T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> in assisting their Sovereign do not employ soldiers to force the Empire. The methods of government they adopt are such as have a tendency to react upon themselves. Where garrisons are quartered, briars and thorns spring up&#8212;<I>q.d.</I>, the land is deserted by the people. Disastrous years inevitably follow in the wake of great armies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise rulers act with decision, and nothing more. They do not venture to use overbearing measures. They are decided without self-conceit, or boasting, or pride. They are decided in spite of themselves, and without presuming on brute force.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finest weapons of war are implements of disaster. All creatures hate them; therefore those who are possessed of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> make no use of them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal man, in his own house, regards the left hand as the more honourable. Those who use weapons of war, give honour to the right&#8212;[as being that in which arms are brandished]. Weapons are implements of disaster; they are not the implements employed by the ideal man. If he ever uses them, he does so because he cannot help it. He regards tranquillity and passionlessness as supreme.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victory in war is not a beautiful thing. Those who see beauty in it are such as take delight in killing men. It is impossible for those who take delight in killing others to obtain the suffrages of the Empire.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In matters of joyful import, the left-hand is the more highly esteemed; in matters of disaster, the right-hand. The general second

in command occupies the left-hand position [in the war-chariot]; it is the general-in-chief who is stationed on the right. The meaning of this is that the latter is placed similarly to a chief mourner at a funeral&#8212;<I>q.d.</I>, in an inauspicious position. Having been instrumental in killing multitudes of people, he should weep bitterly with pity and compassion. Having gained a victory in battle, he thus still occupies the position of [chief] mourner at a funeral.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If feudal Princes and Sovereigns can but preserve it, all creatures will reform themselves.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtue, in those of supreme authority, does not itself claim to be virtue; and that is why [virtuous rulers] are possessed of [true] virtue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtue, in those of lower rank, does not recognise its own loss as such; and that is why unvirtuous [Ministers and people] have no [true] virtue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtue of those in supreme authority is inactive, and does not use action [in government].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtue of those of lower rank is active, and employs active measures.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Although] the benevolence of those in supreme authority is active, it yet does not depend on action [for making itself felt].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rectitude of those in supreme authority is active, and finds vent in active measures.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremonial observances of those in supreme authority are active, and there is not a single man who does not respond to them. Under these circumstances all will bare the arm and submit to the guidance [of their rulers].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when the T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> has attained its full development, it results in Virtue; when Virtue has attained its full development, it results in Benevolence; when Benevolence has attained its full development, it results in Rectitude; when Rectitude has attained its full development, it results in Ceremonial observances.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>*&#8270;* It is necessary to give my authority, in a special manner, for this translation. It is found, of course, in the Commentary:&#8212;###. There is no getting over so plain a direction as this.</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ceremonial observances are nothing but an attenuation of uprightness and sincerity, they become the head and front of disorder.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>*&#8270;* The Commentator says that the ### is the offspring of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>, and the progenitor of the Cosmos&#8212;###. Compare chap. XLI.</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry out this doctrine to the proof:&#8212;Heaven, if deprived of its source of clearness, would be in danger of disruption; Earth, if deprived of its source of motionlessness, would be in danger of upsetting; the gods, if deprived of their source of divine intelligence, would be in danger of being abandoned by their worshippers; valleys, if deprived of their source of replenishment, would be in danger of drying up; creatures, if deprived of their source of production, or life, would be in danger of annihilation; and Princes and Kings, if deprived of their source of honour and dignity, would be in danger of being overthrown.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the ruling classes regard the commonalty as the foundation [of their power] and those in high position necessarily regard the proletariat as that upon which they rest. Hence Princes and Kings style themselves orphans, solitary ones, unworthy ones; is not this an acknowledgment that the commonalty is their support, or <I>point d'appui?</I> Is it not so? To come, then, to the point: when patricians and plebeians are both without [conflicting] private desires, the only difference between the two is that the former resemble polished gems, while the latter are like unhewn stones.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>*&#8270;* The meaning of this is that the ruling classes bear the same relation to the proletariat that jade bears to common stone.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the principle of sexual connection was known, the [cosmic] embryo was formed; this was because the germinating essences [of the Yin and Yang] had come together.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>*&#8270;* This rendering differs widely from that of Su Tsz-yu, which is much simpler, and more in continuity with what goes before. His exposition has been adopted by Julien:&#8212;"He [the ungrown boy] knows nothing yet of the union of the sexes, but nevertheless certain parts of his body experience a virile orgasm. That comes from the perfection of the semen." The view of L&uuml; Tsu is however borne out by several passages in the <I>Yi Ching</I>. The character ### is explained as synonymous with ###. Julien translates it <I>virilia</I>; "si pueri recens nati virilia, absque cupiditate surgunt [###], id e seminis redundantia, non cordis ardore oriri patet." L&uuml; Tsu sees a more philosophical meaning in the passage than this.</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cry all day, and yet not become hoarse; this comes from the completion of the harmony.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heart dominates the vital energy, or breath, the man becomes daily stronger.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>*&#8270;* The Commentator says:&#8212;###.</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the Sage is correct in his conduct, and never abandons [his correctness]; he is incorruptible, and never inflicts injury [by a bad example]; he is straightforward, and never acts at random; he shines [with internal radiance], but dazzles no one.</P>

betimes [to T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>]. Early submission [to T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>] implies a heavy accumulation of virtue. When virtue is thus heavily accumulated there is nothing to which the man is inadequate; when there is nothing to which a man is inadequate, it is impossible to know the limit of his resources; and the man whose resources are thus limitless, is fit to possess the State.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possession of the Mother of the State [the principle of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>] involves its long endurance. It may then be said to have a deep root and a solid stalk.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The [prince], by a quiescent policy, makes himself humble.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that a great State, by bearing itself humbly towards a small State, gains its allegiance; and a small State, by bearing itself humbly towards a great State, may obtain possession of it. Thus an inferior [State] can either be taken by this means, or can itself take [a superior one].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a great State has no desire beyond protecting all its subjects equally, and a small State has no desire but to belong to [the greater one] and to serve its Prince, both will attain to the positions proper to each.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore, though the Emperor be enthroned, and his Ministers appointed, holding their jade badges of office in front of them and riding in a chariot and four: it would be better to remain seated in quiet, and to adopt, or enter into, this T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was this T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> that the ancients reverenced. Why do not [the rulers of to-day] strive daily to acquire it?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great, the small, the many, the few, [are all equal in his sight]. He recompenses injury with kindness. In setting about difficult tasks, he begins with what is easy. In performing great things, he begins with little ones.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficult affairs of the world must be begun from what is easy the great things of the world must be begun from what is small. That is why the Sage never sets about great undertakings and yet is able to accomplish great things.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightly made promises lead to very little faith [being placed in the promiser]. He to whom most things are very easy at first will certainly find many difficulties afterwards. Thus the Sage always recognises the existence of difficulty, and by this means he never experiences any difficulty in practice.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When [the State] is at peace, it is easily supported, or maintained. When portents have not yet appeared, it is easy to provide for [future contingencies]. When a thing is brittle, it is easily broken. When a thing is minute, it is easily dispersed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act before pressing necessity for action arises. Govern well the State before anarchy breaks out. A tree which takes the arms of two men to span it, grew from a tiny sprout. A tower nine storeys high was raised from a mound of earth. A journey of a thousand <I>li</I> begins with a foot's pace.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who acts, fails; he who grasps, loses. The Sage never acts, and therefore he never fails; he never grasps, and therefore he never loses.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people, in their undertakings, frequently fail when they are on the verge of accomplishment. The cautious act towards the end of an undertaking as at the commencement; and that is why they never fail.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Sage desires as though he desired not; and attaches no value to things difficult of acquisition. He learns what others do not learn, and returns to what is passed over by the multitude. By this means he promotes the spontaneous development of all things, and that without venturing to act.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of governing the people arises from their excess of shrewdness. He who employs shrewdness in governing a State, becomes a robber of the State; he who does not do so, is a blessing to it. The man who knows both these things presents an ideal of good government, and a knowledge of this ideal constitutes Sublime Virtue. Sublime Virtue is deep and far-reaching, and is in direct opposition to all objects of desire; thus it is able to bring about universal accordance [with T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that rivers and seas are able to be rulers over all water-courses is due to their downward tendency. It is on account of this that they are able to dominate all waters. Therefore the Sage who desires to reign over the people must be retiring in demeanour. Then, when the Sage occupies a high position, his subjects will not be self-sufficient; when he leads the van, his subjects will not work injury [by disobedience or rebellion].

I do not venture to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot." This may be called operating negatively, and appropriating [the enemy's possessions] without infringing propriety. Were this policy pursued, there would be no withstanding [of our arms], and capture might be effected without striking a blow.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no greater calamity than that of despising an enemy. By underestimating the enemy one brings about the loss of [the three things] I prize. Wherefore when opposing forces meet in battle, it is the compassionate who conquer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My words are easy to understand, easy to put in practice; [yet] the world can neither understand nor practise them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My words have an underlying intent; my actions have a ruling motive. It is only ignorance that causes men not to understand my doctrine.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who understand me are few; those who copy me are worthy. Wherefore the Sage dresses in coarse robes while hiding a jewel in his breast.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who understand [the T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>] are up conscious of their upward progress. Those who count their ignorance as knowledge, are diseased. It is only those who treat themselves as sick who are therefore free from disease. The Sage, who is not diseased, treats himself as though he were; wherefore his disease becomes no disease at all.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people do not stand in awe of severe enactments, great visitations will befal [the State].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When [a man] does not behave indecorously within doors, he will not inspire disgust in others. It is only when [the prince] does not inspire disgust that [his subjects] will submit to him without reluctance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore is it that the Sage, though possessed of intuitive knowledge, yet makes no self-display; respects, but does not exalt himself; thus adopting the one course and avoiding the other.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When bravery is pushed to rashness, a man will incur a violent death. When courage is tempered by caution, he will preserve his life.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two conditions result, the one in benefit, the other in injury. Who knows the cause of Heaven's animosity [to either]? Thus it is that even the Sage here sees a difficulty.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> of Heaven never strives, yet excels in victory; it speaks not, yet excels in responding [to desert]; it beckons not, yet [things] come to it of their own accord; it lies concealed, yet excels in organising. The net of Heaven extends everywhere. Its meshes are wide, but nothing ever escapes it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposing the people are made constantly afraid of death, so that when they commit unlawful acts I arrest them and have them killed, who will dare [afterwards to misbehave]? For then there will always be <I>yiu-sze</I>, or civil magistrates, to execute them. Now the execution of men on behalf of the inflictor of the death-punishment [by those not legally qualified to do so] may be compared to hewing on behalf of a master carpenter; and people who [attempt to] hew instead of a master carpenter mostly cut their hands.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SMALL>*&#8270;* The expression ### means, literally, "office-holder," and is used in the sense of "one of the executive" or "an officer holding judicial functions," as opposed to expectants and mere administrative officials, such as Censors, etc. The <I>Chou Li</I> says, "The ### are ###." According to the <I>Shu Ching</I>, "W&ecirc;n Wang had no necessity to transact in person the minor functions of state, such as punishments, litigation, and so on; it was the underlings of the ### who prevented disobedience to the laws."

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunger of the people is due to the exorbitant taxation levied by their rulers. That is why they starve.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of governing the people arises from the policy of action adopted by their rulers. That is why government is difficult. The light esteem in which people hold death is due to the over-anxiety with which they struggle for life. That is why they hold death so cheap. It is only those who do not exert themselves on behalf of their life that know how to hold life in true honour; [or, who are superior to those who hold life in too high esteem].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men, when born, are weak and soft; when dead, they are stiff and hard.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When inanimate objects&#8212;say, the vegetable creation&#8212;are first produced, they are soft and tender; when dead, they are hard and dry.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore hardness and rigidity are associated with death; softness and weakness with life. So, when soldiers are violent, they gain no victories; when the tree is strong, a combination of strength is used [to fell it]. Its big parts are below; its soft and tender parts above.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> of Heaven resembles a drawn bow. It brings down the high and exalts the lowly; it takes from those who have superfluity, and gives to those who have not enough. The T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> of Heaven abstracts where there is too much, and supplements where there is deficiency.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> of men does not so. It takes away from what is already deficient in order to bestow on those who have a superfluity. Who is able to devote his surplus to the needs of others?&#8212;Only he who is possessed of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it is that the Sage acts, yet does not plume himself; achieves works of merit, yet does not hold to them. He has no wish to make a display of his worthiness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing under Heaven that is weaker or softer than water; yet those who attack what is hard and strong are not aware that it is [the soft and weak] that can overcome it. [Thus] they do not see that, their task is an easy one.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that weakness overcomes strength, that the soft overcomes the hard, is unknown to none; yet they cannot act upon it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the Sage says: He who bears the reproach of the State may be called lord of the nation's altars; he who bears the calamities of the State may be called the King of the world. These are true words, though apparently at variance [with reason]; <I>i.e.</I>, paradoxical.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When peace is made after a great quarrel, there is always a feeling of resentment left behind. How can this be regarded as right?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore the Sage, unwilling to shift responsibility upon others, keeps, on his left hand, an officer to make record [of his obligations]. The virtuous man keeps a record of his compacts; the unprincipled man repudiates [or destroys] them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> of Heaven has no favourites; its practice is simply to reward the virtuous.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a small State, sparsely populated, supposing that I had weapons for a thousand men, I would not use them. I would rather teach my subjects to think seriously of death, and not to emigrate to a distance. Then, though they might have ships and chariots, nobody

<!------------------------page 48------------------------>

<A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A>

would mount them; though they might have armour and weapons, nobody would set them in array. I would make them return to the use of the quipu, render their food toothsome, beautify their clothes [by cultivating the silkworm], live tranquilly at home, be happy in their domestic usages, keep watch with neighbouring states for their mutual safety, and let the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs be heard by one another [from their numbers and proximity]. Thus the people would die of old age without ever coming into [hostile] collision with each other.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faithful words are not pleasant. Pleasant, or specious, words are not faithful.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtuous do not bandy arguments. Those who bandy arguments are not virtuous. The wise do not seek learning [from outside]. Those who do so are not wise.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sage does not lay up hidden stores [of T<SMALL>AO</SMALL>], The more he employs it on behalf of others the more he has for himself. The more he imparts to others, the more his own stores increase.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> of Heaven confers benefit, and injures not. The T<SMALL>AO</SMALL> of the Sage acts, and does not strive.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reader is requested to refer to Chap. VI, the first sentence of which is literally rendered, "The Spirit of the Depths is immortal," It would be better, perhaps, to follow the reading of the Commentary, which runs "The Breath of the Deep is imperishable." For further reference to this Breath see <I>infra</I>, passages in the <I>T&#8216;ai Hsi</I> and the <I>Hsin Yin</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further beg to recommend any student anxious to follow out the theories of Taoism embodied in the Commentary of L&uuml; Ts&ucirc;, to read a very curious and  interesting book by that author entitled ###, or 'Occult Mysteries respecting the Cultivation of the Pure Essence,' kindly sent to me by my friend M. K&eacute;&iuml;ta Goo, of the Imperial Japanese Diplomatic Service, while the present volume was passing through the press. It is well worth study.</P>
