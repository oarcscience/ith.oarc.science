<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tz&#365; Ch&#145;i</span> of Nan-kuo sat leaning on a table. Looking up to heaven, he sighed and became absent, as though soul and body had parted. Yen Ch&ecirc;&#145;ng Tz&#365; Yu, who was standing by him, exclaimed "What are you thinking about that your body should become thus like dry wood, your mind like dead ashes? Surely the man now leaning on the table is not he who was here just now."</p>  
<p>"My friend," replied Tz&#365; Ch&#145;i, "your question is apposite. To-day I have buried myself. . . . Do you understand? . . . Ah! perhaps you only know the music of Man, and not that of Earth. Or even if you have heard the music of Earth, you have not heard the music of Heaven."</p>  
<p>"Pray explain," said Tz&#365; Yu.</p>  
<p>"The breath of the universe," continued Tz&#365; Ch&#145;i, "is called wind. At times, it is inactive. But when active, every aperture resounds to the blast. Have you never listened to its growing roar? Caves and dells of hill and forest, hollows in huge trees of many a span in girth,&#151;these</p>  
<p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></A></p>  
<p>are like nostrils, like mouths, like ears, like beam-sockets, like goblets, like mortars, like ditches, like bogs. And the wind goes rushing through them, sniffing, snoring, singing, soughing, puffing, purling, whistling, whirring, now shrilly treble, now deeply bass, now soft, now loud; until, with a lull, silence reigns supreme. Have you never witnessed among the trees such a disturbance as this?"</p>  
<p>"Well, then," inquired Tz&#365; Yu, "since the music of Earth consists of nothing more than holes, and the music of Man of pipes and flutes, of what consists the music of Heaven?"</p>  
<p>"The effect of the wind upon these various apertures," replied Tz&#365; Ch&#145;i, "is not uniform. But what is it that gives to each the individuality, to all the potentiality, of sound? . . . Joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, caution and remorse, come upon us by turns, with ever-changing mood. They come like music from hollowness, like mushrooms from damp. Daily and nightly they alternate within us, but we cannot tell whence they spring. Can we then hope in a moment to lay our finger upon their very cause?</p>  
<p>"But for these emotions, <i>I</i> should not be. But for <i>me</i>, they would have no scope. So far we can go; but we do not know what it is that brings them into play. &#146;Twould seem to be a <i>soul;</i> but the clue to its existence is wanting. That such a power operates is credible enough,</p>  
<p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></A></p>  
<p>though we cannot see its form. It has functions without form.</p>  
<p>"Take the human body with all its manifold divisions. Which part of it does a man love best? Does he not cherish all equally, or has he a preference? Do not all equally serve him? And do these servitors then govern themselves, or are they subdivided into rulers and subjects? Surely there is some soul which sways them all.</p>  
<p>"But whether or not we ascertain what are the functions of this soul, it matters but little to the soul itself. For, coming into existence with this mortal coil of mine, with the exhaustion of this mortal coil its mandate will also be exhausted. To be harassed by the wear and tear of life, and to pass rapidly through it without possibility of arresting one's course,&#151;is not this pitiful indeed? To labour without ceasing, and then, without living to enjoy the fruit, worn out, to depart, suddenly, one knows not whither,&#151;is not that a just cause for grief?</p>  
<p>"What advantage is there in what men call not dying? The body decomposes, and the mind goes with it. This is our real cause for sorrow. Can the world be so dull as not to see this? Or is it I alone who am dull, and others not so? . . . There is nothing which is not objective: there is nothing which is not subjective. But it is impossible to start from the objective. Only from subjective knowledge is</p>  
<p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></A></p>  
<p>it possible to proceed to objective knowledge. Hence it has been said, 'The objective emanates from the subjective; the subjective is consequent upon the objective. This is the Alternation Theory.' Nevertheless, when one is born, the other dies. When one is possible, the other is impossible. When one is affirmative, the other is negative. Which being the case, the true sage rejects all distinctions of this and that. He takes his refuge in God, and places himself in subjective relation with all things.</p>  
<p>"And inasmuch as the subjective is also objective, and the objective also subjective, and as the contraries under each are indistinguishably blended, does it not become impossible for us to say whether subjective and objective really exist at all?</p>  
<p>"When subjective and objective are both without their correlates, that is the very axis of Tao. And when that axis passes through the centre at which all Infinities converge, positive and negative alike blend into an infinite One. . . Therefore it is that, viewed from the standpoint of Tao, a beam and a pillar are identical. So are ugliness and beauty, greatness, wickedness, perverseness, and strangeness. Separation is the same as construction: construction is the same as destruction. Nothing is subject either to construction or to destruction, for these conditions are brought together into One.</p>  
<p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></A></p>  
<p>"Only the truly intelligent understand this principle of the identity of all things. They do not view things as apprehended by themselves, subjectively; but transfer themselves into the position of the things viewed. And viewing them thus they are able to comprehend them, nay, to master them; and he who can master them is near.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> So it is that to place oneself in subjective relation with externals, without consciousness of their objectivity,&#151;this is Tao. But to wear out one's intellect in an obstinate adherence to the individuality of things, not recognising the fact that all things are One,&#151;this is called <i>Three in the Morning</i>."</p>  
<p>"What is <i>Three in the Morning?</i>" asked Tz&#365; Yu.</p>  
<p>"A keeper of monkeys," replied Tz&#365; Chi, "said with regard to their rations of chestnuts, that each monkey was to have three in the morning and four at night. But at this the monkeys were very angry, so the keeper said they might have four in the morning and three at night, with which arrangement they were all well pleased. The actual number of the chestnuts remained the same, but there was an adaptation to the likes and dislikes of those concerned. Such is the principle of putting oneself into subjective relation with externals.</p>  
<p>"Wherefore the true sage, while regarding</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></A></p>  
<p>contraries as identical, adapts himself to the laws of Heaven. This is called following two courses at once.</p>  
<p>"The knowledge of the men of old had a limit. It extended back to a period when matter did not exist. That was the extreme point to which their knowledge reached. The second period was that of matter, but of matter unconditioned. The third epoch saw matter conditioned, but contraries were still unknown. When these appeared, Tao began to decline. And with the decline of Tao, individual bias arose."</p>
