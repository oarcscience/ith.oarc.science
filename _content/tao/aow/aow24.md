### CORRIGENDA

P. [ix](aow02.htm#page_ix), *note*: For "edition" read "translation."

[14](aow10.htm#page_14), line 3: For "by" read "in the."

„ [16](aow10.htm#page_16), line 5: For "T." read "*T‘u Shu*."

„ „ § 19, *note:* Before "War" insert "Soldiers are not to be used as
playthings."

„ [17](aow11.htm#page_17), § 1: \#, etc. The more I think about it, the
more I prefer the rendering suggested on p. [159](aow20.htm#page_159), §
22, *note*.

„ „ § 1 *note*, and p. [78](aow16.htm#page_78), line 6: Insert "the"
before "Ssŭ-ma Fa."

„ [33](aow13.htm#page_33), note on heading: Cf. X. § 12, where \# is
translated "strength," though it might also be "conditions." The three
words \#, \# and \# have been much confused. It appears from the *Shuo
Wên* that the last character is post-classical, so that Sun Tzŭ must
have used either or a in all senses.

„ [45](aow14.htm#page_45), line 1: For "sublety" read "subtlety."

„ [63](aow15.htm#page_63), line 4: M. Chavannes writes in the *T‘oung
Pao*, 1906, p. 210: "Le général Pan Tch‘ao n’a jamais porté les armes
chinoises jusque sur les bords de la mer Caspienne." I hasten to correct
my statement on this authority.

„ [80](aow17.htm#page_80), 9<sup>th</sup> line from the bottom: For \#
read \#.

„ [100](aow18.htm#page_100), § 23, *note*, and p.
[126](aow19.htm#page_126), 5<sup>th</sup> line from bottom: For "Huang
Shih-kung" read "Huang-shih Kung."

„ [124](aow19.htm#page_124), line 7: For "Ch‘ên" read "Ch‘ên Hao."

„ [136](aow19.htm#page_136), 11<sup>th</sup> line from bottom: Insert
"to" before "select."

„ [152](aow20.htm#page_152), § 2: Substitute semi-colon for full stop
after "available."
