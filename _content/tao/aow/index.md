<span class="small">If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will
succumb in every battle.--p. 25, II:18.</span>

<span class="small">Anger may in time change to gladness;  
Vexation may be succeeded by content.  
But a kingdom that has once been destroyed  
Can never come again into being;  
Nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.  
Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful,  
And the good general full of caution.  
This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact.  
   --p. 159, XII:20-22.</span>

Attributed to the legendary Chinese general, Sun Tzu, the Art of War
also has a strong spiritual component. The work blends Taoism with the
art of statecraft, applying concepts such as 'doing without doing' to
the battlefield. Traditionally written during the Spring and Autumn
period (722-481 BCE), others date it, based on historical and internal
evidence, to the Warring States Period (403-221 BCE). Sun Tzu is
traditionally identified with an historical figure who lived from
544-496 BCE, a general of the King of Wu. Since it first came to the
attention of Westerners in the 19th century, the Art of War has
influenced leaders from Napoleon to Norman Schwarzkopf. Mao tse Tung
attributed it as a source of his thinking on guerilla warfare. The work
is considered a masterpiece of military theory.
