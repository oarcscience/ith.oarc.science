<P>52. 1. (The T&acirc;o) which originated all under the sky is to be considered as the mother of them all.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A></P>
<P>2. When the mother is found, we know what her children should be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril.</P>
<P>3. Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him.</P>
<P>4. The perception of what is small is (the secret of) clear-sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>5. Who uses well his light,<BR>
Reverting to its (source so) bright,<BR>
Will from his body ward all blight,<BR>
And hides the unchanging from men's sight.</P></DIR>

<IMG SRC="img/09500.jpg">, 'Returning to the Source.' The meaning of the chapter is obscure, and the commentators give little help in determining it. As in the preceding chapter, L&acirc;o-dze treats of the operation of the T&acirc;o on material things, he seems in this to go on to the operation of it in man, or how he, with his higher nature, should ever be maintaining it in himself.</P>
<P>For the understanding of paragraph 1 we must refer to the first chapter of the treatise, where the T&acirc;o, 'having no name,' appears as 'the Beginning' or 'First Cause' of the world, and then, 'having a name,' as its 'Mother.' It is the same thing or concept in both of its phases, the ideal or absolute, and the manifestation of it in its passionless doings. The old Jesuit translators render this par. by 'Mundus principium et causam suam habet in Divino <A NAME="img_09501"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09501.jpg">, seu actione Divinae sapientiae quae dici potest ejus mater.' So far I may assume that they agreed with me in understanding that the subject of the par. was the T&acirc;o.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A></P>
<P>Par. 2 lays down the law of life for man thus derived from the T&acirc;o. The last clause of it is given by the same translators as equivalent to 'Unde fit ut post mortem nihil ei timendum sit,'--a meaning which the characters will not bear. But from that clause, and the next par., I am obliged to conclude that even in L&acirc;o-dze's mind there was the germ of the sublimation of the material frame which issued in the asceticism and life-preserving arts of the later T&acirc;oism.</P>
<P>Par. 3 seems to indicate the method of 'guarding the mother in man,' by watching over the breath, the proto-plastic 'one' of ch. 42, the ethereal matter out of which all material things were formed. The organs of this breath in man are the mouth and nostrils (nothing else should be understood here by <A NAME="img_09600"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09600.jpg"> and <A NAME="img_09601"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09601.jpg">;--see the explanations of the former in the last par. of the fifth of the appendixes to the Y&icirc; in vol. xvi, p. 432); and the management of the breath is the mystery of the esoteric Buddhism and T&acirc;oism.</P>
<P>In par. 4 'The guarding what is soft' is derived from the use of 'the soft lips' in hiding and preserving the hard and strong teeth.</P>
<P>Par. 5 gives the gist of the chapter:--Man's always keeping before him the ideal of the T&acirc;o, and, without purpose, simply doing whatever he finds to do; T&acirc;o-like and powerful in all his sphere of action.</P>
<P>I have followed the reading of the last character but one, which is given by Zi&acirc;o Hung instead of that found in Ho-shang Kung and Wang P&icirc;.</P>
