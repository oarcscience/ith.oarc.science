<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">BOOK XXII. KIH PEI Y&Ucirc;.</H3>
<P>With this Book the Second Part of Kwang-dze's Essays or Treatises ends. 'All the Books in it,' says L&ucirc; Sh&ucirc;-kih, 'show the opposition of T&acirc;oism to the pursuit of knowledge as enjoined in the Confucian and other schools; and this Book may be regarded as the deepest, most vehement, and clearest of them all.' The concluding sentences of the last paragraph and L&acirc;o-dze's advice to Confucius in par. 5, to 'sternly repress his knowledge,' may be referred to as illustrating the correctness of L&ucirc;'s remark.</P>
<P>Book seventeenth is commonly considered to be the most eloquent of Kwang-dze's Treatises, but this twenty-second Book is not inferior to it in eloquence, and it is more characteristic of his method of argument. The way in which he runs riot in the names with which he personifies the attributes of the T&acirc;o, is a remarkable instance of the subtle manner in which he often brings out his ideas; and in no other Book does he set forth more emphatically what his own idea of the T&acirc;o was, though the student often fails to be certain that he has exactly caught the meaning.</P>
<P>The title, let it be observed, belongs only to the first paragraph. The Kih in it must be taken in the sense of 'knowledge,' and not of 'wisdom.'</P>
