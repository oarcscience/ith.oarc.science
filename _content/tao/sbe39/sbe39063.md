### 56.

56\. 1. He who knows (the Tâo) does not (care to) speak (about it); he
who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it.

2\. He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of
his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the
complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring
himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called
'the Mysterious Agreement.'

3\. (Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is
beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or
meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven.

<span id="img_10001"></span> ![](img/10001.jpg), 'The Mysterious
Excellence.' The chapter gives us a picture of the man of Tâo, humble
and retiring, oblivious of himself and of other men, the noblest man
under heaven.

Par. 1 is found in Kwang-dze (XIII, 20 b), not expressly mentioned, as
taken from Lâo-dze, but at the end of a string of sentiments, ascribed
to 'the Master,' some of them, like the two clauses here, no doubt
belonging to him, and the others, probably Kwang-dze's own.

Par. 2 is all found in chapters 4 and 52, excepting the short clause in
the conclusion.
