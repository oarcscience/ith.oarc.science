<P>76. 1. Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered.</P>
<P>2. Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life.</P>

They are an anakoluthon, such as is elsewhere found in our King; e.g. <A NAME="img_11900"></A>
