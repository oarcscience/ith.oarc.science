### BOOK XXX. YÜEH KIEN.

We need not suppose that anything ever occurred in Kwang-dze's
experience such as is described here. The whole narrative is
metaphorical; and that he himself is made to play the part in it which
he describes, only shows how the style of writing in which he indulged
was ingrained into the texture of his mind. We do not know that there
ever was a ruler of Kâo who indulged in the love of the

sword-fight, and kept about him a crowd of vulgar bravoes such as the
story describes. We may be assured that our author never wore the
bravo's dress or girt on him the bravo's sword. The whole is a
metaphorical representation of the way in which a besotted ruler might
be brought to a feeling of his degradation, and recalled to a sense of
his duty and the way in which he might fulfil it. The narrative is full
of interest and force. I do not feel any great difficulty in accepting
it as the genuine composition of Kwang-dze. Who but himself could have
composed it? Was it a good-humoured caricature of him by an able
Confucian writer to repay him for the ridicule he was fond of casting on
the sage?
