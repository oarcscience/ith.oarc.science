<P>54. 1. What (T&acirc;o's) skilful planter plants<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can never be uptorn;<BR>
What his skilful arms enfold,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From him can ne'er be borne.<BR>
Sons shall bring in lengthening line,<BR>
Sacrifices to his shrine.</P>
<P>2. T&acirc;o when nursed within one's self,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His vigour will make true;</P></DIR>

<P>And where the family it rules<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What riches will accrue!<BR>
The neighbourhood where it prevails<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thriving will abound;<BR>
And when 'tis seen throughout the state,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good fortune will be found.<BR>
Employ it the kingdom o'er,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And men thrive all around.</P></DIR>

<P>3. In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom.</P>
<P>4. How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation).</P>

<IMG SRC="img/09800.jpg">, ''The Cultivation (of the T&acirc;o), and the Observation (of its Effects).' The sentiment of the first paragraph is found in the twenty-seventh and other previous chapters,--that the noiseless and imperceptible acting of the T&acirc;o is irresistible in its influence; and this runs through to the end of the chapter with the additional appeal to the influence of its effects. The introduction of the subject of sacrifices, a religious rite, though not presented to the Highest Object, will strike the reader as peculiar in our King.</P>
<P>The Teh mentioned five times in par. 2 is the 'virtue' of the T&acirc;o embodied in the individual, and extending from him in all the spheres of his occupation, and is explained differently by Han Fei according to its application; and his example I have to some extent followed.</P>
<P>The force of pars. 3 and 4 is well given by Ho-shang Kung. On the first clause he says, 'Take the person of one who cultivates the T&acirc;o, and compare it with that of one who does not cultivate it;--which is in a state of decay? and which is in a state of preservation?'</P>
