<P>81. 1. Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the T&acirc;o) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the T&acirc;o) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.</P>
<P>2. The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself.</P>
<P>3. With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/12301.jpg">, 'The Manifestation of Simplicity.' The chapter shows how quietly and effectively the T&acirc;o proceeds, and by contraries in a way that only the master of it can understand. The author, says W&ucirc; Kh&auml;ng, 'sums up in this the subject-matter of the two Parts of his Treatise, showing that in all its five thousand characters, there is nothing beyond what is here said.'</P>

<P>Par. 2 suggests to Dr. Chalmers the well-known lines of Bunyan as an analogue of it:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'A man there was, though some did count him mad,<BR>
The more he gave away, the more he had.'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>W&ucirc; Kh&auml;ng brings together two sentences from Kwang-dze (XXXIII, 21 b, 22 a), written evidently with the characters of this text in mind, which, as from a T&acirc;oist mint, are a still better analogue, and I venture to put them into rhyme:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Amassing but to him a sense of need betrays;<BR>
He hoards not, and thereby his affluence displays.'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>I have paused long over the first pair of contraries in par. 3 (<A NAME="img_12400"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/12400.jpg"> and <A NAME="img_12401"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/12401.jpg">). Those two characters primarily mean 'sharpness' and 'wounding by cutting;' they are also often used in the sense of I being beneficial,' and 'being injurious;'--'contraries,' both of them. Which 'contrary' had L&acirc;o-dze in mind? I must think the former, though differing in this from all previous translators. The Jesuit version is, 'Celestis T&acirc;o natura ditat omnes, nemini nocet;' Julien's, 'Il est utile aux &ecirc;tres, et ne leur nuit point;' Chalmers's, 'Benefits and does not injure;' and V. von Strauss's, 'Des Himmels Weise ist wolthun und nicht beschddigen.'</P>
