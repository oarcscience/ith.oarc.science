<P>51. 1. All things are produced by the T&acirc;o, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are</P>
<P><A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A></P>
<P>completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the T&acirc;o, and exalt its outflowing operation.</P>
<P>2. This honouring of the T&acirc;o and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute.</P>
<P>3. Thus it is that the T&acirc;o produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them.</P>
<P>4. It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;-this is called its mysterious operation.</P>
<P><A NAME="img_09400"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09400.jpg">, 'The Operation (of the T&acirc;o) in Nourishing Things.' The subject of the chapter is the quiet passionless operation of the T&acirc;o in nature, in the production and nourishing of things throughout the seasons of the year; a theme dwelt on by L&acirc;o-dze, in II, 4, X, 3, and other places.</P>
<P>The T&acirc;o is the subject of all the predicates in par. 1, and what seem the subjects in all but the first member should be construed adverbially.</P>
<P>On par. 2 W&ucirc; Kh&auml;ng says that the honour of the Son of Heaven is derived from his appointment by God, and that then the nobility of the feudal princes is derived from him; but in the honour given to the T&acirc;o and the nobility ascribed to its operation, we are not to think of any external ordination. There is a strange reading of two of the members of par. 3 in Wang P&icirc;, viz. <A NAME="img_09401"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09401.jpg"> for <A NAME="img_09402"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09402.jpg">. This is quoted and predicated of 'Heaven,' in the Nestorian Monument of Hs&icirc;-an in the eighth century.</P>
