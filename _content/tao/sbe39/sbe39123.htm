<P>1. Nan-kwo Sze-kh&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> was seated, leaning forward on his stool. He was looking up to heaven and breathed gently, seeming to be in a trance, and to have lost all consciousness of any companion. (His disciple), Yen Kh&auml;ng Dze-y&ucirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, who was in attendance and standing before him, said, 'What is this? Can the body be made to become thus like a withered tree, and the mind to become like slaked lime? His appearance as he leans forward on the stool to-day is such as I never saw him have before in the same position.' Dze-kh&icirc; said, 'Yen, you do well to ask such a question, I had just now lost myself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; but how should you understand it? You</P>

<P>may have heard the notes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of Man, but have not heard those of Earth; you may have heard the notes of Earth, but have not heard those of Heaven.'</P>
<P>Dze-y&ucirc; said, 'I venture to ask from you a description of all these.' The reply was, 'When the breath of the Great Mass (of nature) comes strongly, it is called Wind. Sometimes it does not come so; but when it does, then from a myriad apertures there issues its excited noise;--have you not heard it in a prolonged gale? Take the projecting bluff of a mountain forest;--in the great trees, a hundred spans round, the apertures and cavities are like the nostrils, or the mouth, or the ears; now square, now round like a cup or a mortar; here like a wet footprint, and there like a large puddle. (The sounds issuing from them are like) those of fretted water, of the arrowy whizz, of the stern command, of the inhaling of the breath, of the shout, of the gruff note, of the deep wail, of the sad and piping note. The first notes are slight, and those that follow deeper, but in harmony with them. Gentle winds produce a small response; violent winds a great one. When the fierce gusts have passed away, all the apertures</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A></P>
<P>are empty (and still);--have you not seen this in the bending and quivering of the branches and leaves?'</P>
<P>Dze-y&ucirc; said, 'The notes of Earth then are simply those which come from its myriad apertures; and the notes of Man may just be compared to those which (are brought from the tubes of) bamboo;--allow me to ask about the notes of Heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' Dze-kh&icirc; replied, 'When (the wind) blows, (the sounds from) the myriad apertures are different, and (its cessation) makes them stop of themselves. Both of these things arise from (the wind and the apertures) themselves:--should there be any other agency that excites them?'</P>
<P>2. Great knowledge is wide and comprehensive; small knowledge is partial and restricted. Great speech is exact and complete; small speech is (merely) so much talk&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. When we sleep, the soul communicates with (what is external to us); when we awake, the body is set free. Our intercourse with others then leads to various activity, and daily there is the striving of mind with mind. There are hesitancies; deep difficulties; reservations; small apprehensions causing restless distress, and great</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A></P>
<P>apprehensions producing endless fears. Where their utterances are like arrows from a bow, we have those who feel it their charge to pronounce what is right and what is wrong.; where they are given out like the conditions of a covenant, we have those who maintain their views, determined to overcome. (The weakness of their arguments), like the decay (of things) in autumn and winter, shows the failing (of the minds of some) from day to day; or it is like their water which, once voided, cannot be gathered up again. Then their ideas seem as if fast bound with cords, showing that the mind is become like an old and dry moat, and that it is nigh to death, and cannot be restored to vigour and brightness.</P>
<P>Joy and anger, sadness and pleasure, anticipation and regret, fickleness and fixedness, vehemence and indolence, eagerness and tardiness;--(all these moods), like music from an empty tube, or mushrooms from the warm moisture, day and night succeed to one another and come before us, and we do not know whence they sprout. Let us stop! Let us stop! Can we expect to find out suddenly how they are produced?</P>
<P>If there were not (the views of) another, I should not have mine; if there were not I (with my views), his would be uncalled for:--this is nearly a true, statement of the case, but we do not know what it is that makes it be so. It might seem as if there would be a true Governor&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> concerned in it, but we do not find</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_180"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 180</FONT></A></P>
<P>any trace (of his presence and acting). That such an One could act so I believe; but we do not see His form. He has affections, but He has no form.</P>
<P>Given the body, with its hundred parts, its nine openings, and its six viscera, all complete in their places, which do I love the most? Do you love them all equally? or do you love some more than others? Is it not the case that they all perform the part of your servants and waiting women? All of them being such, are they not incompetent to rule one another? or do they take it in turns to be now ruler and now servants? There must be a true Ruler (among them)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> whether by searching you can find out His character or not, there is neither advantage nor hurt, so far as the truth of His operation is concerned. When once we have received the bodily form complete, its parts do not fail to perform their functions till the end comes. In conflict with things or in harmony with them, they pursue their course to the end, with the speed of a galloping horse which cannot be stopped;--is it not sad? To be constantly toiling all one's lifetime, without seeing the fruit of one's labour, and to be weary and worn out with his labour, without knowing where he is going to:--is it not a deplorable case? Men may say, 'But it is not death;' yet of what advantage is this? When the body is decomposed, the mind will be the same along with it:--must not the case be pronounced very deplorable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>? Is the life</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A></P>
<P>of man indeed enveloped in such darkness? Is it I alone to whom it appears so? And does it not appear to be so to other men?</P>
<P>3. If we were to follow the judgments of the predetermined mind, who would be left alone and without a teacher&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>? Not only would it be so with those who know the sequences (of knowledge and feeling) and make their own selection among them, but it would be so as well with the stupid and unthinking. For one who has not this determined mind, to have his affirmations and negations is like the case described in the saying, 'He went to Y&uuml;eh to-day, and arrived at it yesterday&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' It would be making what was not a fact to be a fact. But even the spirit-like Y&uuml;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> could not have known how to do this, and how should one like me be able to do it?</P>
<P>But speech is not like the blowing (of the wind) the speaker has (a meaning in) his words. If, however, what he says, be indeterminate (as from a mind not made up), does he then really speak or not? He thinks that his words are different from the chirpings of fledgelings; but is there any distinction between them or not? But how can the T&acirc;o be so obscured, that there should be 'a True' and 'a False' in it? How can speech be so obscured that there should be 'the Right' and 'the Wrong' about them? Where shall the T&acirc;o go to that it will not</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A></P>
<P>be found? Where shall speech be found that it will be inappropriate? T&acirc;o becomes obscured through the small comprehension (of the mind), and speech comes to be obscure through the vain-gloriousness (of the speaker). So it is that we have the contentions between the Literati&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the Mohists&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the one side affirming what the other denies, and vice vers&acirc;. If we would decide on their several affirmations and denials, no plan is like bringing the (proper) light (of the mind)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to bear on them.</P>
<P>All subjects may be looked at from (two points of view),--from that and from this. If I look at a thing from another's point of view, I do not see it; only as I know it myself, do I know it. Hence it is said, 'That view comes from this; and this view is a consequence of that:'--which is the theory that that view and this--(the opposite views)-produce each the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Although it be so, there is affirmed now life and now death; now death and now life; now the admissibility of a thing and now its inadmissibility; now its inadmissibility and now its admissibility. (The disputants) now affirm and now deny; now deny and now affirm. Therefore the sagely man does not pursue this method, but views things in the light of (his) Heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> (-ly nature), and hence forms his judgment of what is right.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A></P>
<P>This view is the same as that, and that view is the same as this. But that view involves both a right and a wrong; and this view involves also a right and a wrong:--are there indeed, or are there not the two views, that and this? They have not found their point of correspondency which is called the pivot of the T&acirc;o. As soon as one finds this pivot, he stands in the centre of the ring (of thought), where he can respond without end to the changing views;--without end to those affirming, and without end to those denying. Therefore I said, 'There is nothing like the proper light (of the mind).'</P>
<P>4. By means of a finger (of my own) to illustrate that the finger (of another) is not a finger is not so good a plan as to illustrate that it is not so by means of what is (acknowledged to be) not a finger; and by means of (what I call) a horse to illustrate that (what another calls) a horse is not so, is not so good a plan as to illustrate that it is not a horse, by means of what is (acknowledged to be) not a horse&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (All things in) heaven and earth may be (dealt with as) a finger; (each of) their myriads may be (dealt with as) a horse. Does a thing seem so to me? (I say that) it is so. Does it seem not so to me? (I say that) it is not so. A path is formed by (constant)</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A></P>
<P>treading on the ground. A thing is called by its name through the (constant) application of the name to it. How is it so? It is so because it is so. How is it not so? It is not so, because it is not so. Everything has its inherent character and its proper capability. There is nothing which has not these. Therefore, this being so, if we take a stalk of grain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and a (large) pillar, a loathsome (leper) and (a beauty like) Hs&icirc; Shih&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, things large and things insecure, things crafty and things strange;--they may in the light of the T&acirc;o all be reduced to the same category (of opinion about them).</P>
<P>It was separation that led to completion; from completion ensued dissolution. But all things, without regard to their completion and dissolution, may again be comprehended in their unity;--it is only the far reaching in thought who know how to comprehend them in this unity. This being so, let us give up our devotion to our own views, and occupy ourselves with the ordinary views. These ordinary views are grounded on the use of things. (The study of that) use leads to the comprehensive judgment, and that judgment secures the success (of the inquiry). That success gained, we are near (to the object of our search), and there we stop. When we stop, and yet we do not know how it is so, we have what is called the T&acirc;o.</P>
<P>When we toil our spirits and intelligence, obstinately</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_185"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 185</FONT></A></P>
<P>determined (to establish our own view), and do not know the agreement (which underlies it and the views of others), we have what is called 'In the morning three.' What is meant by that 'In the morning three?' A keeper of monkeys, in giving them out their acorns, (once) said, 'In the morning I will give you three (measures) and in the evening four.' This made them all angry, and he said, 'Very well. In the morning I will give you four and in the evening three.' His two proposals were substantially the same, but the result of the one was to make the creatures angry, and of the other to make them pleased:--an illustration of the point I am insisting on. Therefore the sagely man brings together a dispute in its affirmations and denials, and rests in the equal fashioning of Heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Both sides of the question are admissible.</P>
<P>5. Among the men of old their knowledge reached the extreme point. What was that extreme point? Some held that at first there was not anything. This is the extreme point, the utmost point to which nothing can be added&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. A second class held that there was something, but without any responsive recognition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of it (on the part of men).</P>
<P>A third class held that there was such recognition, but there had not begun to be any expression of different opinions about it.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_186"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 186</FONT></A></P>
<P>It was through the definite expression of different opinions about it that there ensued injury to (the doctrine of) the T&acirc;o. It was this injury to the (doctrine of the) T&acirc;o which led to the formation of (partial) preferences. Was it indeed after such preferences were formed that the injury came? or did the injury precede the rise of such preferences? If the injury arose after their formation, K&acirc;o's method of playing on the lute was natural. If the injury arose before their formation, there would have been no such playing on the lute as K&acirc;o's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>K&acirc;o W&auml;n's playing on the lute, Shih Kwang's indicating time with his staff, and Hui-dze's (giving his views), while leaning against a dryandra tree (were all extraordinary). The knowledge of the three men (in their several arts) was nearly perfect, and therefore they practised them to the end of their lives. They loved them because they were different from those of others. They loved them and wished to make them known to others. But as they could not be made clear, though they tried to make them so, they ended with the obscure (discussions) about 'the hard' and 'the White.' And their sons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, moreover, with all the threads of their fathers' compositions, yet to the end of their lives accomplished nothing. If they, proceeding in this way, could be said to have succeeded, then am I also successful;</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A></P>
<P>if they cannot be pronounced successful, neither I nor any other can succeed.</P>
<P>Therefore the scintillations of light from the midst of confusion and perplexity are indeed valued by the sagely man; but not to use one's own views and to take his position on the ordinary views is what is called using the (proper) light.</P>
<P>6. But here now are some other sayings &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:--I do not know whether they are of the same character as those which I have already given, or of a different character. Whether they be of the same character or not when looked at along with them, they have a character of their own, which cannot be distinguished from the others. But though this be the case, let me try to explain myself.</P>
<P>There was a beginning. There was a beginning before that beginning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. There was a beginning previous to that beginning before there was the beginning.</P>
<P>There was existence; there had been no existence. There was no existence before the beginning of that no existence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. There was no existence previous to the no existence before there was the beginning of the no existence. If suddenly there was nonexistence, we do not know whether it was really anything existing, or really not existing. Now I have said what I have said, but I do not know whether what I have said be really anything to the point or not.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_188"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 188</FONT></A></P>
<P>Under heaven there is nothing greater than the tip of an autumn down, and the Th&acirc;i mountain is small. There is no one more long-lived than a child which dies prematurely, and Ph&auml;ng Z&ucirc; did not live out his time. Heaven, Earth, and I were produced together, and all things and I are one. Since they are one, can there be speech about them? But since they are spoken of as one, must there not be room for speech? One and Speech are two; two and one are three. Going on from this (in our enumeration), the most skilful reckoner cannot reach (the end of the necessary numbers), and how much less can ordinary people do so! Therefore from non-existence we proceed to existence till we arrive at three; proceeding from existence to existence, to how many should we reach? Let us abjure such procedure, and simply rest here&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>7. The T&acirc;o at first met with no responsive recognition. Speech at first had no constant forms of expression. Because of this there came the demarcations (of different views). Let me describe those demarcations:--they are the Left and the Right&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; the Relations and their Obligations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; Classifications&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_189"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 189</FONT></A></P>
<P>and their Distinctions; Emulations and Contentions. These are what are called 'the Eight Qualities.' Outside the limits of the world of men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the sage occupies his thoughts, but does not discuss about anything; inside those limits he occupies his thoughts, but does not pass any judgments. In the Khun Khi&ucirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, which embraces the history of the former kings, the sage indicates his judgments, but does not argue (in vindication of them). Thus it is that he separates his characters from one another without appearing to do so, and argues without the form of argument. How does he do so? The sage cherishes his views in his own breast, while men generally state theirs argumentatively, to show them to others. Hence we have the saying, 'Disputation is a proof of not seeing clearly.'</P>
<P>The Great T&acirc;o&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> does not admit of being praised. The Great Argument does not require words. Great Benevolence is not (officiously) benevolent. Great Disinterestedness does not vaunt its humility. Great Courage is not seen in stubborn bravery.</P>
<P>The T&acirc;o that is displayed is not the T&acirc;o. Words that are argumentative do not reach the point. Benevolence that is constantly exercised does not accomplish its object. Disinterestedness that vaunts its purity is not genuine. Courage that is most stubborn</P>
<P>

<P>is ineffectual. These five seem to be round (and complete), but they tend to become square (and immovable)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Therefore the knowledge that stops at what it does not know is the greatest. Who knows the argument that needs no words, and the Way that is not to be trodden&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?</P>
<P>He who is able to know this has what is called 'The Heavenly Treasure-house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.' He may pour into it without its being filled; he may pour from it without its being exhausted; and all the while he does not know whence (the supply) comes. This is what is called 'The Store of Light&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</P>
<P>Therefore of old Y&acirc;o asked Shun, saying, 'I wish to smite (the rulers of) Zung, Kwei, and Hs&uuml;-&acirc;o&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Even when standing in my court, I cannot get them out of my mind. How is it so?' Shun replied, 'Those three rulers live (in their little states) as if they were among the mugwort and other brushwood;--how is it that you cannot get them out of your mind? Formerly, ten suns came out together, and all things were illuminated by them;--how much should (your) virtue exceed (all) suns!'</P>
<P>8. Nieh Kh&uuml;eh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> asked Wang &Icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, saying, 'Do you know, Sir, what all creatures agree in approving and</P>
<P>

</P>

<P>affirming?' 'How should I know it?' was the reply. 'Do you know what it is that you do not know?' asked the other again, and he got the same reply. He asked a third time,--'Then are all creatures thus without knowledge?' and Wang &Icirc; answered as before, (adding however), 'Notwithstanding, I will try and explain my meaning. How do you know that when I say "I know it," I really (am showing that) I do not know it, and that when I say "I do not know it," I really am showing that I do know it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' And let me ask you some questions:--'If a man sleep in a damp place, he will have a pain in his loins, and half his body will be as if it were dead; but will it be so with an eel? If he be living in a tree, he will be frightened and all in a tremble; but will it be so with a monkey? And does any one of the three know his right place? Men eat animals that have been fed on grain and grass; deer feed on the thickset grass; centipedes enjoy small snakes; owls and crows delight in mice; but does any one of the four know the right taste? The dog-headed monkey finds its mate in the female gibbon; the elk and the axis deer cohabit; and the eel enjoys itself with other fishes. M&acirc;o Zhiang&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and L&icirc; K&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> were accounted by men to be most beautiful, but when fishes saw them, they dived deep in the water from them; when birds, they flew from them aloft; and</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_192"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 192</FONT></A></P>
<P>when deer saw them, they separated and fled away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But did any of these four know which in the world is the right female attraction?

<P>Nieh Kh&uuml;eh said (further), 'Since you, Sir, do not know what is advantageous and what is hurtful, is the Perfect man also in the same way without the knowledge of them?'

<P>'I heard the Master (speaking of such language as the following):--"The sagely man does not occupy himself with worldly affairs. He does not put himself in the way of what is profitable, nor try to avoid what is hurtful; he has no pleasure in seeking (for anything from any one); he does not care to be found in (any established) Way; he speaks without speaking; he does not speak when he speaks; thus finding his enjoyment outside the dust and dirt (of the world)." The Master considered all this to be a shoreless flow of mere words, and I consider it to describe the course of the Mysterious Way.--What do you, Sir, think of it?' Khang-w&ucirc; dze replied, 'The hearing of such words would have perplexed even Hwang-T&icirc;, and how should Khi&ucirc; be competent to understand them? And you, moreover, are too hasty in forming your estimate (of their meaning). You see the egg, and (immediately) look out for the cock (that is to be hatched from it); you see the bow, and (immediately) look out for the dove (that is to be brought down by it) being roasted. I will try to explain the thing to you in a rough way; do you in the same way listen to me.</P>
<P>'How could any one stand by the side of the sun and moon, and hold under his arm all space and all time?

But his attitude and appearance were intended by Kwang-dze to indicate what should be the mental condition in reference to the inquiry pursued in the Book;--a condition, it appears to me, of agnosticism.

<P><A NAME="fn_79"></A><A HREF="sbe39123.htm#fr_81">178:1</A> The sounds of Earth have been described fully and graphically. Of the sounds of Man very little is said, but they form the subject of the next paragraph. Nothing is said in answer to the disciple's inquiry about the notes of Heaven. It is intimated, however, that there is no necessity to introduce any foreign Influence or Power like Heaven in connexion. with the notes of Earth. The term Heaven, indeed, is about to pass with our author into a mere synonym of T&acirc;o, the natural 'course' of the phenomena of men and things.</P>

For the phrase, 'the transformation of things,' see in Book X1, par. 5, et al. But the T&acirc;oism here can hardly be distinguished from the Buddhism that holds that all human experience is merely so much m&acirc;ya or illusion.</P>
