It has been objected to it that elsewhere the T&acirc;o is represented as associated with dulness and not intelligence, and with weakness and not with strength.

No doubt, L&acirc;o-dze believed in another life for the individual after the present. Many passages in Kwang-dze indicate the same faith.</P>
