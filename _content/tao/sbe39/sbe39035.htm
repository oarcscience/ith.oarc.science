<P>28. 1. Who knows his manhood's strength,<BR>
Yet still his female feebleness maintains;<BR>
As to one channel flow the many drains,<BR>
All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky.<BR>
Thus he the constant excellence retains;<BR>
The simple child again, free from all stains.</P>
<P>Who knows how white attracts,<BR>
Yet always keeps himself within black's shade,<BR>
The pattern of humility displayed,<BR>
Displayed in view of all beneath the sky;<BR>
He in the unchanging excellence arrayed,<BR>
Endless return to man's first state has made.</P>
<P>Who knows how glory shines,<BR>
Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale;<BR>
Behold his presence in a spacious vale,<BR>
To which men come from all beneath the sky.<BR>
The unchanging excellence completes its tale;<BR>
The simple infant man in him we hail.</P></DIR>

<P>2. The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent measures.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/07100.jpg">, 'Returning to Simplicity.' The chapter sets forth humility and simplicity, an artless freedom from all purpose, as characteristic of the man of T&acirc;o, such as he was in the primeval time. 'The sage' in par. 2 may be 'the Son of Heaven,'--the Head of all rule in the kingdom, or the feudal lord in a state.</P>
