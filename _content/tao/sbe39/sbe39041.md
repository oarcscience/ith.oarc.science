### 34.

34\. 1. All-pervading is the Great Tâo! It may be found on the left hand
and on the right.

them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished,
it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as
with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;-it may be
named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and

doing so;-it may be named in the greatest things.

by Lâo's own name for it in ch. 25, does; and the unconscious simplicity
with which it does it; and then the achievements of the sage who is

in the vegetable world. The statements and expressions are much akin to
those in parts of chapters 2, 10, and 51, and for Ho-shang Kung's
difficult reading of <span id="img_07701"></span> ![](img/07701.jpg)
