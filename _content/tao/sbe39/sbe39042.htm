<P>35. 1. To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible T&acirc;o), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease.</P>
<P>2. Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the T&acirc;o as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible.</P>

In par. 2 the attraction of the T&acirc;o is contrasted with that of ordinary pleasures and gratifications.</P>
