### FIFTY-FOUR

As a thing that is well planted is not easily uprooted and as a thing
that is well guarded is not easily stolen, so if a family observes the
principle of TAO, its descendants will ever hold their ancestors in
honor.

He who practices TAO for himself will only gain teh for himself. He who
practices TAO for the benefit of his family, his teh will pass to his
descendants. If he practices TAO for the welfare of his community, his
teh will be multiplied. If he practices TAO for the benefit of his
country, his teh will become abundantly multiplied. If he practices the
principle of TAO for the sake of the whole world, teh will become
universal.

Therefore, he who practices TAO for himself will

only himself be benefited. He who practices it for the sake of his
family, will have his family benefited. He who practices it for his
community will have his community benefited. He who practices TAO for
the whole world will benefit the whole world.

How do I know all this? It comes from the practice of TAO.
