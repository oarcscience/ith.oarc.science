### SIX

As rivers have their source in some far off fountain, so the human
spirit has its source. To find his fountain of spirit is to learn the
secret of heaven and earth. In this fountain of mystery, spirit is
eternally present in endless supply. Anyone can avail himself of it for
the refreshment and the unfolding greatness of his own spirit by the
earnest practice of concentration, but to do so he must devote himself
to the effort with *wu-wei* of mind and sensitive expectancy.
