<p>Life comes from TAO; its nourishment comes from teh; its shape is formed by materiality; its accomplishments are owing to energy. Therefore among all men there are none who do not honor TAO and esteem teh. Honor for TAO and esteem for teh is never by compulsion, it is always spontaneous. Men understand naturally that life comes from TAO and that teh nourishes them, raises them, nurtures them, completes, matures, rears, and protects them.</p>  
<p>TAO gives life to them but does not exercise authority over them; teh forms them but makes no use of them, raises them but never interferes with them. This is the profound teh of the mysterious TAO.</p>
