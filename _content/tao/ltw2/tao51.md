### FIFTY-ONE

Life comes from TAO; its nourishment comes from teh; its shape is formed
by materiality; its accomplishments are owing to energy. Therefore among
all men there are none who do not honor TAO and esteem teh. Honor for
TAO and esteem for teh is never by compulsion, it is always spontaneous.
Men understand naturally that life comes from TAO and that teh nourishes
them, raises them, nurtures them, completes, matures, rears, and
protects them.

TAO gives life to them but does not exercise authority over them; teh
forms them but makes no use of them, raises them but never interferes
with them. This is the profound teh of the mysterious TAO.
