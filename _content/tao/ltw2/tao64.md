### SIXTY-FOUR

That which is at rest can easily be taken hold of. That which has not
yet become important, can be easily prevented. The fragile is easily
broken, light things are easily scattered. It is wise to be prepared for
difficulties and to establish order before there is disorder. A tree
that it takes both arms to encircle grew from a tiny rootlet. A many
storied pagoda is built by placing one brick upon another brick. A
journey of three thousand miles is begun by a single step. If one
attempts to govern either himself or another, he is bound to make a
failure of it. If he tries to grasp anything, it slips away from him.

The perfect Sage, therefore, by practicing *wu-wei* and making no
attempts, makes no failures, and because he does not grasp anything, he
has nothing to lose. People in their eagerness are ever approaching
success only to continually fail. If one is to succeed, he must be as
careful to the end as at the beginning.

Therefore, the perfect Sage has no desire for things that are difficult
to obtain, nor does he value them. He learns to be unlearned; he turns
away from that which others greedily seek. In that spirit he helps

all things toward their natural development but dares not attempt to
force their development.
