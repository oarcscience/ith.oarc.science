### FORTY-FIVE

The enlightenment of the perfect Sage, because of its simplicity,
appears as lacking, but his wisdom never fails. Perfect homogeneity
appears as emptiness, but its potentiality is never exhausted. Extreme
frankness appears as evasive, great skill as clumsiness, great eloquence
as stammering. Motion conquers cold, while quietness conquers heat.
Purity and tranquillity are the true characteristics of creation.
