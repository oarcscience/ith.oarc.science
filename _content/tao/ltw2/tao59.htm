<p>In governing people and in worshiping heaven, nothing surpasses the teh of self-restraint. The restraint of desire is like returning to the original TAO. Returning to one's origin means the recovery of one's vitality. When one has recovered his original vitality, nothing is unmanageable. If nothing is unmanageable then he retains his original tranquillity because he is unconscious of any limits. When he retains this state of tranquillity he may govern the country wisely. Moreover, when he is in a state of tranquillity, he will govern the country as a mother takes care of her children and by so doing long retain his usefulness. He will be like a plant having a strong stem and deep roots. He will manifest the longevity of TAO.</p>
