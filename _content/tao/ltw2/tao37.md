TAO acts without assertion, yet all things proceed in conformity with
it. If princes and kings would

follow the principle of TAO, then all things would unfold according to
their own nature. If there are troublesome desires arising from the
habits of the people, they should be taught the principle of simplicity
that characterizes the ineffable TAO.

Even the conception of the ineffable TAO's simplicity ought not to
remain in one's mind. When quietness is attained, not by ideas and the
satisfaction of desires but by the practice of non-assertion, the
troubles of the world will right themselves.
