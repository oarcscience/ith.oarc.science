<p>The rivers and seas become the kings of the myriad valleys because they are content with the low places. The perfect Sage rises above his people because of his humility; because he is first willing to follow them, he comes to leadership.</p>  
<p>Although the perfect Sage is above his people, yet they feel no burden; he dominates them, but they cherish no resentment. Therefore the world rejoices to exalt the perfect Sage and never wearies of him. Because he does not seek to rival others, others have no desire to rival him.</p>
