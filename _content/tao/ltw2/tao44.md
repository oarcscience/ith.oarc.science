### FORTY-FOUR

Which is more intimately precious: fame or life? Which is more valuable:
life or treasure? Which gives the most trouble: gain or loss? One
naturally seeks the things he most prizes; for that reason we should be
careful to prize the right things, because grasping and hoarding invite
waste and loss both to property and life.

A contented person is never dishonored. One who knows how to stop with
enough is free from danger; he will therefore endure.
