<p>Which is more intimately precious: fame or life? Which is more valuable: life or treasure? Which gives the most trouble: gain or loss? One naturally seeks the things he most prizes; for that reason we should be careful to prize the right things, because grasping and hoarding invite waste and loss both to property and life.</p>  
<p>A contented person is never dishonored. One who knows how to stop with enough is free from danger; he will therefore endure.</p>
