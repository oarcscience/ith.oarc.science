<p>If a man indulges his desire for looking at the five beautiful colors, his perception of their beauty will become dull; if a man indulges a desire for listening to the five musical tones, his perception of their music</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A></p>  
<p>will become dulled; if he indulges a desire for the five pleasant tastes, his perception of their deliciousness will become dull. If a man indulges a desire for racing and hunting, he will lose his appreciation of tranquillity and may become mad. So it is with the lure of hidden treasure that tempts a man to do evil.</p>  
<p>Therefore the perfect Sage aims at usefulness and is not deceived by the illusions of sense. A man in hunger desires food to satisfy his hunger and is little concerned by its beauty and delicacy.</p>
