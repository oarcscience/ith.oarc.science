### SIXTY-TWO

TAO is an all-embracing mystery. It is treasure to good men and a refuge
to bad men. Fine words are used in selling goods, but it is a noble life
that wins the respect of others. Even though TAO is despised by common
people, why should I be foolish as are they and ignore it?

In the establishment of a monarchy, (there are many things that are to
be considered): the emperor is to be enthroned, the three ministers are
to be appointed, the precious gems that have been presented to the
emperor are to be distributed, and the tribute war-horses are to be
properly exhibited. But nothing is more important than the dedication of
the throne to TAO. For what reason did the ancients so highly esteem
TAO? Was it not because it was only by devotion to TAO that the hopes of
the nation could be realized and the miseries of the people relieved?

That is why TAO is honored by all the world.
