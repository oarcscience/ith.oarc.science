<p>The whole world is naturally drawn to him who keeps this principle of TAO'S true Greatness. It goes to TAO and receives no harm; on the contrary it finds contentment, tranquillity and peace. To common people TAO'S principle of simplicity and humility seems weak and insipid; they desire and seek music and dainties. Indeed, TAO has no taste! When looked at, there is nothing to be prized; when listened for, it can scarcely be heard; but its satisfactions are inexhaustible.</p>
