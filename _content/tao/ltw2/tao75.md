### SEVENTY-FIVE

When a ruler appropriates too much of the taxes, starvation comes to the
people. The reason why people are difficult to govern is because the
ruler is thinking too much of his own interests. People make light of
death because they are absorbed in the interests of life. The one who is
not absorbed in life is wiser than he who esteems life.
