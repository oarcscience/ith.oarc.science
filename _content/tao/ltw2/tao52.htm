<p>When the potentiality of TAO manifests itself, it becomes the mother of all things. When one realizes that his life comes from this universal Mother, he will also realize his brotherhood to all her descendants. When one realizes his descent from the universal Mother and his brotherhood with all humanity, he will cherish his life and thus, to its end, will be kept in perfect health.</p>  
<p>He who talks little and closes his sense gates will never become wearied to the end of life; he who talks much, and yields to the desires of his senses, and interferes with affairs, will be risking his life continually.</p>  
<p>To be thoughtful and mindful is to be enlightened. To be humble and yielding is better than great</p>

<p>strength. To use one's intelligence to seek enlightenment and to control one's body is to return to the nature of one's origin.</p>
