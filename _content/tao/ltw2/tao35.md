### THIRTY-FIVE

The whole world is naturally drawn to him who keeps this principle of
TAO'S true Greatness. It goes to TAO and receives no harm; on the
contrary it finds contentment, tranquillity and peace. To common people
TAO'S principle of simplicity and humility seems weak and insipid; they
desire and seek music and dainties. Indeed, TAO has no taste! When
looked at, there is nothing to be prized; when listened for, it can
scarcely be heard; but its satisfactions are inexhaustible.
