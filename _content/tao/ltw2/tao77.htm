<p>The TAO of Heaven resembles the stretching of a bow. The mighty it humbles, the lowly it exalts; the overflowing it diminishes, the insufficient it supplies.</p>  
<p>The way of humans is not so. Humans take from the needy to further enrich the rich. The one who can take from his over-abundance and give to a needy world has attained Taohood. Therefore, the perfect Sage is not sparing of his services, nor does he look upon them as meritorious, nor does he make a display of them. Is this not so?</p>
