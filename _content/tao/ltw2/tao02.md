### TWO

Our minds naturally perceive the beauty of things on account of their
beautifulness; so they also have

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

a feeling of disgust for their ugliness on account of their ugliness. It
is the same with goodness and badness. Everything in the world is
mutually opposing and revealing itself.

So existence and non-existence are mutually related; the difficult and
the easy are always in combination; the long and the short always
qualify each other; the high and the low are always in opposition; the
loud and the soft are loud and soft only in contrast with each other;
the before and the behind are contrasted but always keep company.

Therefore the perfect Sage in avoiding the limitations of relativity
resorts to no compulsion, nor does he make invidious comparisons in
teaching his people. Whatever he does is done in harmony with the
principle of TAO. Whatever he produces is not kept in his own
possession; whatever he does is not exhibited with pride; whatever he
accomplishes is not dwelt upon with self-conceit. Because he avoids
possession, and pride and self-conceit, his accomplishments are kept in
lasting memory.
