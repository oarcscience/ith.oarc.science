### FIFTY-FIVE

He who attains to the highest teh of simplicity and sincerity, may be
compared to the ingenuousness of an infant. Poisonous insects do not
sting their own young, wild beasts do not attack their own cubs, nor do
birds of prey. A baby's bones may be weak and its muscles soft, but its
spiritual vitality is perfect. An infant does not know about the
relation of the sexes, but gradually its generative vigor will develop.
Its spirit is virile, indeed! It may sob and cry all day but will not
become hoarse. His unity as a child is perfect.

To understand how to preserve this unity and soundness, one must return
to his original state of simplicity. To know how to return to one's
original state is to be enlightened. To increase one's natural vigor
means blessedness. To control one's breathing means strength. Things
that are fully grown begin to decay, for growth is contrary to the
principle of TAO. Things that are contrary to TAO soon pass away.
