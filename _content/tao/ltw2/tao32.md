### THIRTY-TWO

TAO is eternal but is unnamable. Its simplicity, though considered as of
the humblest, is most independent.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nothing in the
world is able to bring it into subjection. If princes and kings retain
simplicity heaven and earth are harmoniously unified and, everywhere
drop the sweet dew of their favor naturally and evenly.

As soon as things are given names, greed and grasping arise and, unless
one understands when to stop, there will be no satisfying the desires.
To know when to be satisfied and to restrain desire, is to know the
secret of longevity. This is the principal of TAO. It resembles the
great rivers that flow into the seas, but which have their origin in the
little streams of the valleys.
