<p><div style="font-size: 93%">At first when there was chaos, there was the female principle, then there ascended the male principle, and heaven was divided; the former principle increased, the latter diminished, and then both harmonized; heaven and earth then appeared, and the Great Reason, and this was the Creation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></small></p>  
<p>The Figure given in the books is that of the Founder of Tauism. He is popularly termed Lao-tse, the Old Child; from the white appearance of his head and the aged appearance of his face at birth. The epithet really means the Old Master. His surname Li was derived from the name for a plum tree, under which he was said to have been born. He was a contemporary of Confucius. The illustration is, as described, an attitude of meditation assumed by the Tauist and Buddhist priests.</p>
