Its form is that of a yellow deer with two heads. It stores up the will. It resembles a round stone, is of two colours like white silk reflected on purple. It is placed opposite the navel, and lies in close contact with the lumbar spine. The left kidney is the real one, and mates with the five viscera.

The pulse of the kidney issues from the middle of the soles of the feet. (See illustration).</p>
