<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Level Frame</span>. (#).&#8212;There are four "horse-riding" (#) forms under this position.</p>  
<p>1.&#8212;Standing evenly and uprightly, separate the feet the width of the shoulders apart and keep the palms upward on the same level as the loins. Do not lean against anything.</p>  
<p>2.&#8212;Turn the palms downwards, always on the same level as the loins.</p>  
<p>3.&#8212;Rub evenly from the sides and make a circle as if rubbing the head.</p>  
<p>4.&#8212;Then stretch the arms straight forward and erect the hands with the palms directed forward and fingers upwards on the same level as the nipple; take one breath, and wait a little, about the time of three respirations. Afterwards, after taking a breath, the eyes should be directed to the right, left, above and below, the time of three respirations being taken as the unit.</p>  
<p>There are also two "looking-moon" (#), forms under this position.</p>  
<p>1.&#8212;Let the left foot take a step horizontally to the side, bend the left knee, incline the left foot; keep both the right leg and foot straight. Lay the left hand on the upper aspect of the thigh, with the thumb directed backwards and wind the right hand round the back of the right ear and with the five fingers in a form as if holding a thing, the points of the fingers directed backwards like the claws of a vulture.</p>  
<p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="green">p. 274</font></A></p>  
<p>2.&#8212;Afterwards, raise the left hand up to the level of the eye, the fingers clenched so that the thumb shall be opposite the little finger, the second one, the fourth and the middle one projecting a little. Keep the palm&#8212;the heart of the hand&#8212;hollow, sufficient to contain the lid of a tea cup. First look at the height of the left hand, then turn the head even and take a breath. Again turn the head and look at the part between the thumb and forefinger. Repeat this on the right side; three times on each side, swallowing six mouthfuls of air.</p>  
<p>There are two "expanding-breath" (#), forms tinder this position.</p>  
<p>1.&#8212;The first resembles the first "horse-riding" form, except that the palms are even.</p>  
<p>2.&#8212;The second resembles the last "horse-riding" form, except that the hands are turned and pushed to the front like the last of the "horse-riding" forms and no breath is taken.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Preliminary Military Exercises</span>.&#8212;(#), There are three forms under this position and seven diagrams.</p>

<p>2.&#8212;Stretch out the left hand which was formerly laid on the leg straight to the left and keep the palm downwards.</p>  
<p>3.&#8212;Turn the left hand back to the level of the breast and then stretch it out again and bring it back, repeating it two times.</p>  
<p>4.&#8212;Turn over the hand on the breast with the thumb upwards and the other fingers downwards and the palm opposite the breast and take a breath.</p>  
<p>5.&#8212;Turn the hand with the thumb downwards and the middle finger upwards and turn the head to the left.</p>  
<p>6.&#8212;Stretch out the hand opposite to the breast and wind it round the ear, keep the palm directed upwards and extend it to the left.</p>  
<p>7.&#8212;Turn it back from behind the ear and clench the fist in front of the breast, keep the outer part of the fist directed upwards, take a breath and then turn the head to the left. To be done on the right also, each side three times, altogether taking eighteen breaths.</p>

<p>9.&#8212;This form is exactly related to the last. For the 3rd time, pronate the palms, the two little fingers close together and stretch them upwards.</p>  
<p>10.&#8212;Then lower the fingers, form them into fists, let them be evenly arranged and circularly as if enfolding things; the two fists 18 or 19 inches apart. One breath is then taken. This is to be performed three times, so three breaths should be taken.</p>

<p>2.&#8212;Hold the bag with the right hand, with it beat the left arm steadily down to the left palm and fingers several times. This is beating the inner part of the left arm.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rule</span>.&#8212;Always beat straight down&#8212;never backwards&#8212;nor return on any omitted part. It should be done at once.</p>

<p>6.&#8212;This and the following are both termed "carrying the tripod on the shoulder" (#). Whirl the left hand from under the ribs, clench the fist, stretch it straight upwards with energy, keeping the thumbs at the back part, then take a breath and look upward at the rising fist.</p>  
<p>7.&#8212;Holding the bag with the right hand, beat with it from the left ribs steadily down to the front side of the left leg, knee, shinbone, instep of foot and toe. This is called beating the front part of the lower left limb.</p>  
<p><a name="page_280"><font size="1" color="green">p. 280</font></A></p>  
<p>8.&#8212;This is termed "coiling the elbow" (#). Open the left fist and whirl it round the ear, then bend the elbow and clench the fist on a level with the breast, take a breath and raise the elbow a little. Now with the bag in the right hand beat steadily from the left armpit inclined to the left loin and to the outer ankle and the side of the little toe.

Protect the secret parts by covering them with the right hand and beat with the left hand beginning from the left side of the "little abdomen" steadily to the inner part of the left leg and left toe. If there be abdominal illness of any kind, it may be cured by beating several times. This is beating the inner part of the lower left limb.</p>  
<p>10.&#8212;This and the next two are called "resting-on-the-knee." The right foot bent, left foot straight, the left hand holding the bag press on the right in the middle of the leg, also the right hand pressing on the bag, then take a breath.</p>

The left hand holding the bag turn the hand back and beat the left part under the back consecutively to the loin, then return the hand and beat the left buttock, left leg, knee, calf down to the heel. This is beating the back part of the lower left limb. After having gone through the exercises on the left upper and lower limbs then transfer to the right upper and lower limbs, following the same method.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Position of "Scooping The Moon at the Bottom of the Sea"</span> (#) has five forms.</p>
