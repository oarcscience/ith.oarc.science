<p>This Maiden is one of the Eight Genii. When born, six hairs were seen growing on the crown of her head. At fourteen she dreamed that a spirit gave her instruction in the art of procuring immortality, in the obtaining of which she was to eat powdered mother-o&#8217;-pearl. She vowed herself to a life of virginity, wandered in the mountains, lived on herbs, and ultimately disappeared from mortal view. She has since, it is said, been twice seen.</p>
