No. 3.—Hsü Shên-wêng's (\#) Method of preserving the Air and opening the

1.—The mouth, the door of the lungs.

2.—The teeth, the leaves of the door.

3.—The larynx, the inspiratory door. (The sounds in Chinese for
expiration and inspiration resemble the sounds produced by the acts, as
for example *hu hsi*, to expire and inspire respectively).

4.—The gullet, the mouth of the stomach.

5.—The cardiac orifice.

6.—The pyloric orifice.

7.—The anus.

beggars in winter adopt this attitude to keep themselves warm), let the

The attitude resembles Amiot's No. 6, which is said to be against
fulness and embarrassment in the intestines, with weakness.
