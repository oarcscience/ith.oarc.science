<p>The Tiger is the greatest of the four-footed creatures, the lord of wild animals, and represents the masculine principle of nature. He lives for a thousand years. When 500 years old, he becomes white. His claws act as a talisman; and the ashes of his skin, when worn about the person, act as a charm against disease. In Tauist literature, the Dragon and the Tiger play a most important part.</p>  
<p>No. 1.&#8212;The Mountain-Jumping Tiger.</p>  
<p>Jump from one place to another, and then back, 24 times. In this way, the black dragon and white tiger are brought face to face, and the door of the hill (to become genii) will be opened.</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_21600"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21600.jpg"></p>  
<p>No. 2.&#8212;The Tiger coming out of the Cave.</p>  
<p>The person, on all fours, moves backwards and forwards, each 12 times. The muscles and bones are thus made and kept movable, the viscera enjoy peace, and the blood and veins flow regularly.</p>  
<p><a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 217</font></A></p>  
<p>No. 3.&#8212;The Flying-Rainbow Tiger.</p>  
<p>The two arms are stretched out together in one direction, first to the left and then to the right, 24 times, as if flying to the right and to the left. This opens the chest, and makes it feel comfortable. The muscles, bones and heart are likewise benefited, and so disease is prevented. (The illustration resembles those for the Second and Tenth months of the Year's Series).</p>  
<p>No. 4.&#8212;The Relaxing-Tendon Tiger.</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_21700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21700.jpg"></p>  
<p>Both legs are stretched out flat on the ground from the body right and left, with the arms grasping the feet like the string of a bow, turning to the right and left 12 times each way. With the view of moving the muscles, ligaments and bones, preventing the production of disease, or removing it far off.</p>  
<p>No. 5.&#8212;The Tiger suspended from a Beam.</p>  
<p>Suspended from a cross-bar, weigh the body, first on one hand, then on the other, 24 times; and all manner of diseases will vanish, the air and blood will circulate, and the viscera be made comfortable.</p>  
<p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></A></p>  
<p>No. 6.&#8212;The Tiger fixed like the Tripod of an Incense Burner.</p>  
<p>Sit cross-legged and straight, with hands at the side like a tripod firmly fixed, with the shoulder placed straight, and the head thrown up 24 times. This is considered great <i>kung-fu</i>, and calculated to produce great good.</p>  
<p>No. 7.&#8212;The Standing-on-one-Leg Tiger.</p>  
<p>First on one side, and then on the other, each 12 times. To give peace to the bones and ligaments of the entire body.</p>  
<p>No. 8.&#8212;The Turning-his-Body Tiger.</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_21800"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21800.jpg"></p>  
<p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></A></p>  
<p>As if the feet were flying, and the two hands on the ground supporting the body. To be done 24 times without stopping. To prevent the air stopping anywhere, and causing debility and laziness of the body.</p>  
<p>No. 9.&#8212;The Tiger turning himself.</p>  
<p>The hands are turned with palms backwards, and the shoulders are grasped firmly 81 times. Used for broadening the chest, and causing the blood and air to move constantly. (The illustration is similar to No. 3, of the Medicinal Kung).</p>  
<p>No. 10.&#8212;The Tiger swallowing Saliva.</p>  
<p>The saliva to be swallowed 24 times. To diminish the fire (inflammation) of the heart.</p>  
<p>No. 11.&#8212;The Peach-Blossom Tiger.</p>  
<p>The face is to be roughed with both hands, the voice is to be thrown out by pronouncing <i>ha</i> until the face is red and quite hot, and there are no wrinkles, and the face is as if the person had been drinking.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>No. 12.&#8212;The Peaceful Spirit Tiger.</p>  
<p>Sit cross-legged, to pacify the heart, as if looking at a beautiful garden or picture.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></A></p>  
<p>No. 13.&#8212;The Tiger (a lady) playing the Dragon's Flute.</p>  
<p>There are no holes in the sides; therefore played at the end If it be not blown, the air can not enter; and, if the air do not enter the road is not open; and, if the road be not open, the <i>tan-t&#8216;ien</i> air does not move, and the person is not able to play. If it succeed, then the <i>tan-t&#8216;ien</i> air passes to the "Heavenly Door," and so round the entire body, according to diagram illustrative of the <i>Physiology of Kung-fu</i> (inserted at the end).</p>  
<p>No. 14.&#8212;The Dragon (a man) playing the Tiger's Guitar.</p>  
<p>To cause the heart to desire and wish for things, and then both their hearts will be joyful and contract no disease (different musical instruments are recommended).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_21"></A><A HREF="kfu079.htm#fr_21">219:*</A> The peach tree is an emblem and symbol of longevity, and derives much of its allegorical character from a reference to it in the <i>Book of Odes</i>. It occupies too a prominent position in the mystical fancies of the Tauists. Magical virtues were very early attributed to twigs of this tree, and its use in making handles, beating down earth with the view of driving away demons, is in constant demand, and originally in writing charms to be placed over the doors at the New Year to drive off evil spirits. The pilgrims to Miao-f&ecirc;ng-shan, in the Fourth moon, bring back peach sticks to ward off evil spirits. A host of superstitious notions cluster around the peach-wood,&#8212;many of a magical nature. It yielded the fruit of immortality. According to Mayers, one of the panaceas of the Tauists was said to be composed of the peach tree mingled with the powdered ash of the mulberry, which not alone cured all diseases but also conferred the boon of immortality.</P>
