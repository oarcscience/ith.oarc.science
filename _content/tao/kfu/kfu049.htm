<P><A NAME="fn_9"></A><A HREF="kfu049.htm#fr_9">172:*</A> One of the Eight Immortals of the Tauists, who flourished toward the close of the 7th and middle of the 8th century. He led an erratic life and performed wonderful feats of necromancy. Mayers informs us that he had a white mule as his constant companion, which carried him thousands of miles in a day, and which, when he halted, he folded up and hid away in his wallet. By spirting water from his mouth upon the packet, the beast again resumed its proper shape. He was asked to Court, but the ascetic wanderer spurned every tempting offer.</P>
