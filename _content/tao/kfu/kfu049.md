### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[172:\*](kfu049.htm#fr_9) One of the Eight
Immortals of the Tauists, who flourished toward the close of the 7th and
middle of the 8th century. He led an erratic life and performed
wonderful feats of necromancy. Mayers informs us that he had a white
mule as his constant companion, which carried him thousands of miles in
a day, and which, when he halted, he folded up and hid away in his
wallet. By spirting water from his mouth upon the packet, the beast
again resumed its proper shape. He was asked to Court, but the ascetic
wanderer spurned every tempting offer.
