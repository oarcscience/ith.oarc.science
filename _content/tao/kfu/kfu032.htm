<p>"The Immortal with the Iron Staff" is included by Tauist writers in the category of the Eight Immortals. His surname was Li. He is largely represented in Chinese legendary lore. No precise period is assigned to his existence upon earth. His disembodied spirit entered the body of a lame and crooked beggar, and in this shape the philosopher continued his existence, supporting his halting footsteps with an iron staff. Hence his name, T&#8216;ieh Kwai.</p>
