<p>Close the doors of the senses; blunt the sharp; unravel the confused; harmonise the dazzling; become one with the all. This is the Mystery of Unity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> There will then neither be love nor hate; profit nor loss; favor nor disgrace. It follows that in the universe there is nothing nobler.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p><div style="font-size: 90%">"The profoundest truths of spiritual experience are those which are not intellectually ascertained but spiritually discerned, which are not taught to us but revealed in us; and these never can be adequately put into words. They defy definition; they transcend expression. The highest experiences even of earthly love and hope and joy cannot be translated into terms of common speech. As there is a life which can be expressed only in terms of music, and another which is expressible only in terms of art, so there is a life which is truly inexpressible. All that he who has obtained even a glimpse of this realm can hope to do is to afford a glimpse to others, by recalling a like experience in their life, 'comparing spiritual things with spiritual.'"&#8212;<i>Lyman Abbott, D. D.</i></div></p>
