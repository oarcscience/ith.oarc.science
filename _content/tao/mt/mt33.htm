<p>When one uses the Tao in assisting his sovereign, he will not employ arms to coerce the state. Such methods easily react.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Where military camps are established briers and thorns flourish. When great armies have moved through the land calamities are sure to follow.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The capable are determined, but no more. They will not venture to compel; determined, but not conceited; determined, but not boastful; determined, but not arrogant; determined because it cannot be helped; determined, but not forceful.</p>  
<p>When things reach their prime, they begin to age. This cannot be said to be the Tao. What is NOT the Tao soon ends.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p><div style="font-size: 90%">War is crude, unrefined cruelty; a creator of divisions, and an opponent of the unity underlying creation; brute force and strategy are its weapons, each a contradiction of the simplicity and purity of God; its effects extend beyond the physical, and to those who have open ears there come from the Unseen, echoes similar to the lament of the Great Spirit in Hiawatha:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">"O my children! my poor children!<br> &nbsp;Listen to the words of wisdom,<br> &nbsp;From the lips of the Great Spirit,<br> &nbsp;From the Master of Life, who made you!"</p>  
<p>"I am weary of your quarrels,<br> &nbsp;Weary of your wars and bloodshed, <a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></A><br> &nbsp;Weary of your prayers for vengeance,<br> &nbsp;Of your wranglings and divisions;<br> &nbsp;All your strength is in your union,<br> &nbsp;All your danger is in discord;<br> &nbsp;Therefore be at peace henceforward,<br> &nbsp;And as brothers live together."</div></p>  
<p>Armies when contending seem to be the most commanding forces in the universe, yet is their strength unequal to the Spiritual Force&#8212;electricity.</div></p>
