### CHAPTER XIV.

Looked for but invisible—it may be named 'colorless.' <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45)

Listened for, but inaudible—it may be named 'elusive.' <span
id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46)

Clutched at but unattainable—it may be named 'subtile.' <span
id="fr_47"></span>[3](#fn_47)

These three cannot be unraveled by questioning, for they blend into
one. <span id="fr_48"></span>[4](#fn_48)

Neither brighter above, nor darker below.

Its line, though continuous, is nameless, and in that it reverts to
vacuity.

It may be styled 'The form of the formless;' 'The image of the
imageless;' in a word—'The indefinite. <span
id="fr_49"></span>[5](#fn_49)

Go in front of it and you will discover no beginning; follow after and
you will perceive no ending.' <span id="fr_50"></span>[6](#fn_50)

Students may consult *The Chinese Recorder* for 1886, which contains an
article by Rev. J. Edkins, D. D., entitled, "On the Words I, Hi, Wei, in
the Tau Teh King." Also an essay by the same writer in *The China
Review*, vol. xiii. Also Victor von Straus’ Tau-tê-King in loc.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

Lay hold of this ancient doctrine; apply it in controlling the things of
the present day, <span id="fr_51"></span>[7](#fn_51) you will then
understand how from the first it has been the origin of
everything. <span id="fr_52"></span>[8](#fn_52)

Here, indeed, is the clue to the Tao. <span
id="fr_53"></span>[9](#fn_53)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Every name of God and each attribute are but shadows of the Reality,
limited manifestations of the Limitless, as time is an attribute of
Eternity, mind an attribute of Consciousness, flame an attribute of
Fire. "Dwelling in light unapproachable" is Paul's description. (I Tim.
vi, 16.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_45"></span>[24:1](mt17.htm#fr_45) Because in It all colors
are equalized.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[24:2](mt17.htm#fr_46) Because in It all sounds
are harmonized.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[24:3](mt17.htm#fr_47) Within It is all Form,
yet It is formless.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[24:4](mt17.htm#fr_48) Three metaphysical
hypostases, but one in essence, the unit of all consciousnesses,
personified by the Hindus as Ishvara. The passage bears a close
resemblance to Mesopotamian thought. The idea of a trinity in unity is a
conception common to all religions, ancient or modern. Without the
concrete ideas of substance, life and motion even an abstract concept of
the Divine is impossible.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[24:5](mt17.htm#fr_49) Cf. the Akhmin Codex,
translated in "Fragments of a Faith Forgotten," by [G. R. S.
Mead](errata.htm#4), p. 585.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[24:6](mt17.htm#fr_50) Cf. the Hindu Shloka
quoted by Mrs. Besant in "*Four Great Religions*," p. 19—"When there is
no darkness, neither day nor night, neither being nor non-being, there
is Shiva alone. He is indestructible. He is to be adored by Savitri,
from him alone comes forth the ancient wisdom. Not above, nor below, nor
in the midst can he be comprehended, nor is there any similitude for him
whose name is infinite glory. Not by the sight is established <span
id="page_25">p. 25</span> his form; none beholds him by the eye. Those
who know him by the heart and the mind, dwelling in the heart, become
immortal."

<span id="fn_51"></span>[25:7](mt17.htm#fr_51) "Employ the ancient
doctrine of non-attachment to action, to govern the present period of
continuous action."—*Tung-tei-ning*.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[25:8](mt17.htm#fr_52) Of the evil as well as of
the good. Cf. *Isa*. xlv, 7. *Amos*. iii, 6.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[25:9](mt17.htm#fr_53) viz. Building the
invisible into the visible. Said a Christian writer in the Middle Ages,
"Praying will either make a man leave off sinning, or sinning will make
a man leave off praying."
