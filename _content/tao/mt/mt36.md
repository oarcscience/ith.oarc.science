### CHAPTER XXXIII.

Who knows men has discernment; who knows himself has illumination. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120)

Who overcomes men has strength; who overcomes himself has determination.
Who knows contentment has wealth. <span id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_121)

Who acts vigorously has will. <span id="fr_122"></span>[3](#fn_122)

Who never departs from his base, endures long; he dies, but does not
perish; he lives eternally. <span id="fr_123"></span>[4](#fn_123)

Immortality is a prize to be won, not an estate to be inherited. "These
are they which come out of the great tribulation, and they washed their
robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." (*Rev*. vii, 14.)
They ate the flesh and drank the blood of the Son of Man. (*John* vi,
54); and then in turn poured out their own blood for the thirsty and
gave their own flesh to the hungry, thus filling up on their part "that
which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ." (*Col*. i, 24.) There is
no alkali but this spiritual self-surrender, which finds its meat and
its drink in doing the will of the Father (*John* iv, 34), which can
wash our robes free of the stains of mortality, and make them pure with
an incorruptible

whiteness. To attain to this not only is it necessary to know men but to
know one's Self; not only is contentment required, but a vigorous- will,
and "Ile that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death." (Rev.
iii, 11.) *E coelo descendit* (γνῶθι σεαυτόν)—"From heaven descends (the
precept) 'know thyself.'" (Juvenal ii, 27.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_120"></span>[58:1](mt36.htm#fr_120) The discernment which
gives knowledge of men by providing points for comparison produces the
illumination which leads to self-knowledge. Su Cheh says that one can
never know himself until he puts all distinctions on one side; a
statement supported by Porphyry, who in his treatise on sensation says
that the mind only sees itself when it regards objects, as ''the mind
embraces everything, and all that exists is nothing but the mind, which
contains bodies of all kinds." See *Encyc. Britt.*, 9th edit., vol. i.,
p. 461. Comp. also the teachings of Plotinus.

"I, the imperfect, adore my own perfect."—Emerson in his essay on "*The
Oversoul*."

<span id="fn_121"></span>[58:2](mt36.htm#fr_121) "The Princely Man is
contented even in poverty."—*Chinese proverb*. See Phil. iv. 11.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[58:3](mt36.htm#fr_122) "When I seek nothing
from without, but vigorously attend to myself there is nothing which can
interfere with my will."—*Su Cheh*.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[58:4](mt36.htm#fr_123)

"So death, so called, can but the form deface,  
 The immortal soul flies out in empty space,  
 To seek her fortune in another place."
