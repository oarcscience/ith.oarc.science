### CHAPTER LXVII.

It was once generally affirmed that the greater the Self the more
impossible it was to compare it with anything else. <span
id="fr_221"></span>[1](#fn_221) Now it is just this greatness which
makes it incomparable; should, however, a comparison be demanded, it
would have to be described as the eternal, which is imperceptible. Now
the Self has three treasures, to which it clings as to inseparables—the
first is compassion, <span id="fr_222"></span>[2](#fn_222) the second,
self-restraint, the third, nowhere venturing to claim precedence.

Compassionate—therefore irresistible! <span
id="fr_223"></span>[3](#fn_223)

Self-restrained—therefore enlarged!

Nowhere venturing to claim precedence—therefore efficient! <span
id="fr_224"></span>[4](#fn_224)

Now-a-days men cast compassion on one side, yet expect to be
irresistible! They discard self-restraint, yet look for enlargement;
They forget to retire, yet demand precedence!—this is death. <span
id="fr_225"></span>[5](#fn_225)

As regards compassion, rely on it when you would contend, and you will
overcome; rely on it when you would protect, and you will succeed.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Heaven is ever
ready to deliver because of the protection compassion brings. <span

"He shall not strive, nor cry aloud;  
 Neither shall anyone hear his voice in the streets.  
 A bruised reed shall he not break,  
 And smoking flax shall he not quench,  
 Till he send forth judgment unto victory,  
 And in his name shall the Gentiles hope."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_221"></span>[113:1](mt70.htm#fr_221) True greatness cannot
be included in any one class to the exclusion of the others, and
therefore it cannot be classified.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[113:2](mt70.htm#fr_222) Maclagan, who
translates *tz’u* by gentleness instead of compassion, notes that
"Gentleness corresponds to the female element which appears more than
once in the *Tao-teh-king*."

<span id="fn_223"></span>[113:3](mt70.htm#fr_223) Cf. II. Sam. xxii, 36.
Hsü-hui-hi notes that compassion is irresistible because it never exerts
its strength until force is unavoidable.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[113:4](mt70.htm#fr_224) Lit. "a vessel of
highest honor." v. Legge *in loc*.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[113:5](mt70.htm#fr_225) Can the flower live
when the root is gone?

<span id="fn_226"></span>[114:6](mt70.htm#fr_226) Students will observe
that my translation differs materially from the renditions of previous
laborers in the same field. Whether for better or for worse I must leave
to the judgment of Chinese scholars, and the intuitions of those to whom
the ancient philosopher is a teacher.
