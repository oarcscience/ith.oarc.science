<p>Fame or life, which is dearer? Life or wealth, which is more? Gain or loss, which is worse?</p>  
<p>Excessive love implies excessive outlay. Immoderate accumulation implies heavy loss.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Who knows contentment meets no shame. Who knows when to stop incurs no danger. Such long endure.</p>  
<p><div style="font-size: 90%">We possess nothing more valuable than our ideals, but the only ideal which is not immoderate is that ideal content which is content with nothing for self; to stop short of this is to linger where danger lurks. Mystics of all ages, irrespective of their religious profession have realized this. A few paragraphs from a Spanish Catholic of the sixteenth century&#8212;Saint Jean de la Croix&#8212;will illustrate Lao-tzu's thought:</p>  
<p>&#8220;To enjoy the taste of all things, have no taste for anything.</p>  
<p>&#8220;To know all things, learn to know nothing.</p>  
<p>&#8220;To possess all things, resolve to possess nothing.</p>  
<p>&#8220;To be all things, be willing to be nothing.</p>  
<p>&#8220;To get to where you have no taste for anything, go through whatever experiences you have no taste for.</p>  
<p>&#8220;To learn to know nothing, go whither you are ignorant.</p>  
<p>&#8220;To reach what you possess not, go whithersoever you own nothing.</p>  
<p>&#8220;To be what you are not, experience what you are not.</p>  
<p>&#8220;When you stop at anything, you cease to open yourself to the All.</p>  
<p>&#8220;For to come to the All, you must give up the All.</p>  
<p>&#8220;And if you should attain to owning the All, you must own it, desiring Nothing.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>With this compare an hitherto untranslated saying by Lu Hui-neng, the sixth and last Chinese Buddhist Patriarch: "To be able to separate one's self from all affections is the pith of tranquillity."</div></p>
