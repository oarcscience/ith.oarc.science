### CHAPTER LIX.

For the regulation of mankind and the service of heaven nothing equals
reserve power. <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_194) Reserve power means
a speedy submission. Speedy submission implies a rich store of energy. A
rich store of energy means the subjugation of everything. Everything
being subdued none knows his limits. His limits being unknown his
sovereign power is assured, having the root <span
id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_195) of sovereignty which endures for long.

This may be described as a 'deep taproot,' and a 'durable peduncle,'—the
perpetual vitality and continued manifestation of the Tao.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The Tao, the eternal THAT is all powerful because It remains ever beyond
the attraction to this or that. Therefore the Lord Jesus taught his
disciples that the way to obtain all that is needful for earth is to
seek *first* the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
