### CHAPTER IV.

The Tao is as emptiness, so are its operations. It resembles
non-fullness. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14)

Fathomless! It seems to be the ancestor of all form.

It removes sharpness, unravels confusion, harmonizes brightness, and
becomes one with everything.

Pellucid! <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15) It bears the appearance of
permanence.

I know not whose son it is. Its Noumenon (εἴδωλον) was before the
Lord. <span id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16)

No matter what road we take, we find "No thoroughfare"

conspicuously displayed at the end. Hence Lao-tzu describes his never
absent Presence, intangible yet omnipresent, formless yet the Father of
form, as "*Emptiness*"—apprehensible but not comprehensible. The thought
of man can only proceed in certain limited directions, and therefore
This, the Ubiquitous, "containing everything, yet contained in all,"
cannot be explained. Whoever would perceive It must leave the beaten
track of routine, and in a solitary by-way go forward by the single aid
of the higher intuitive powers. Furthermore, It, the one comprehensive
Unit, "*resembles non-fulness*," for we only know the perceptions It
excites in our consciousness, never adequate to represent that which is
the Consciousness of all consciousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_14"></span>[7:1](mt07.htm#fr_14) He who understands it
desires nothing. "What is king-do to us, O Govinda, what enjoyment or
even life?"—*Bhagavad Gita* (The Despondency of Arjuna).

<span id="fn_15"></span>[7:2](mt07.htm#fr_15) Rev. iv, 6. Undefiled by
contact.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[7:3](mt07.htm#fr_16) "God was not the Lord—in
the creature only hath he become the Lord, I ask to be rid of the Lord;
that is, that the Lord by his grace would bring me into the Essence,
which is before the Lord, and above distinction. I would enter into that
Eternal Unity which was mine before all time, above all addition and
diminution—into that immobility whereby all is moved."—Master Eckhart.

"Eternity is unborn and eternal. God is born into the Godhead when he
begins to create. The Creator creates himself. He is the Creator because
he calls the creation into being. The word rests in God until it begins
to be uttered, even as the thought rests in man until it has been
conceived."—Dr. Hartmann (Leipzig).

"There are two forms of Brahman, time and non-time. That which was
before the sun is non-time and bas no parts. That which had its
beginning from the sun is time and has parts."

"Two Brahmans have to be meditated on, the word and the non-word. By the
word alone is the non-word revealed."

"Two Brahmans are to be known, the word-Brahman and the highest Brahman;
he who is perfect in the word-Brahman attains the highest
Brahman."—Upanishads. (*Sacred* Books of the East, vol. xv, pp. 317 and
321.)

''Perfect personality is to be found only in God, while in all finite
spirits there exists only a weak imitation of personality; the
finiteness of the finite is not a productive condition of personality,
but rather a limiting barrier to its perfect development."—Lotze.
