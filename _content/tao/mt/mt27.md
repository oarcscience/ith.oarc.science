### CHAPTER XXIV.

Who tiptoes, totters. <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96) Who straddles,
stumbles. <span id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_97) The self-regarding cannot
cognise; the egotistic are not distinguished; the boastful are not
meritorious; the self-conceited cannot excel. Such from the standpoint
of the Tao are like remnants of food, or parasites, <span
id="fr_98"></span>[3](#fn_98) which all things probably detest. Hence,
those who possess the Tao are not so. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[4](#fn_99)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

In a universe where self-sacrifice is the master law of life the
self-seeker is a blot on the sun, a fog obscuring the landscape, a cog
slowing the wheel of evolution. He is an intruder for whom there is no
rightful place, a shadow masquerading as a reality. Like salt, which has
lost its flavor, he is "fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill"
(*Matt*. v, 13). Yet so infinite is the divine patience at the heart of
things, that, "from the standpoint of the Tao," parasitical though he
be, the self-seeker is permitted to remain, notwithstanding his
inharmony with the scheme of the world. "The Lord is not slack
concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is long suffering
to you-ward, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should
come to repentance." (II *Pet*. iii, 9.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_96"></span>[43:1](mt27.htm#fr_96) "Besser nicht anfangen,
Denn erliegen."—German Proverb.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[43:2](mt27.htm#fr_97) "He who stretches his
legs does not walk (easily)."—James Legge.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[43:3](mt27.htm#fr_98) Cf. Marcus Aurelius'
simile of the man who separates himself from nature. "He is an abscess
on the universe."—Bk. v. ch. ix.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[43:4](mt27.htm#fr_99) The teaching of the
chapter is illustrated by a quotation in the "Doctrine of the Mean." "It
is said in the Book of Poetry, 'Over her embroidered robe she puts a
plain garment,' intimating a dislike to the display of the elegance of
the former. Just so it is the way of the Lordly Man to prefer
concealment, while he every day becomes more illustrious, and it is the
way of the small-minded man to seek notoriety, while he daily goes more
and more to ruin."

"A wise man never competes under any circumstances."—Confucius.
