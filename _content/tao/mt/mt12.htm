<p>It is better to leave alone, than to grasp at fullness.</p>  
<p>Sharpness, which results from filing, cannot be preserved.</p>  
<p>None can protect the hall that is filled with gold and jade.</p>  
<p>Opulence, honors, pride, necessarily bequeath calamity.</p>  
<p>Merit established, a name made, then retirement&#8212;this is the way of Heaven.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p><div style="font-size: 90%">"A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone," says Thoreau.</p>  
<p>"In praying, use not vain repetitions as the Gentiles do." "When ye fast, be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance; for they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen of men to fast." Such "grasping at fulness" had better be left alone.</p>  
<p>"Meat will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, do we lack." Asceticism which begins and which ends in the outer leaves the heart without permanent trace; it is a sharpness which is filed; it leads to self-assertion, to pride and to disputations. "Each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ." Minds full of names and parties are as vulnerable as a "hall filled with gold and jade."</p>  
<p>Honors are shadowed by calamities; therefore "I thank God that I baptized none of you.&#8230; We are fools for Christ's sake.&#8230; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seer: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."</p>  
<p>"Merit established, a name made, then retirement&#8212;this is the way of heaven."</div></p>
