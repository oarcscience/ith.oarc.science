### CHAPTER LXVIII.

The most skillful warriors are not war-like; the best fighters are not
wrathful; the mightiest conquerors never strive; the greatest masters
are ever lowly.

This is the glory of non-strife; and the might of utilization; these
equal heaven, they were the goal of the ancients.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

Desire for self-assertion is the controlling motive on the material
plane—dogma contends with dogma, creed with creed, Church with Church.
On the spiritual plane the sense of separateness which produces
contention disappears and as the material is controlled by the moral,
the physical by the spiritual, it follows that, centuries of contrary
conceptions notwithstanding, the greatest might is that which does not
contend. An anonymous writer has well said:

"Force and evil are no remedy. Use those means, and we shall find we
only move the trouble from one quarter into another, and the difficulty
we apparently get out of in one direction has come home to roost in
another, stronger than ever. Goodness, and Goodness only, will destroy
evil, and make our lives in this world—and in the next—smooth and
comfortable." <span id="fr_227"></span>[\*](#fn_227)
