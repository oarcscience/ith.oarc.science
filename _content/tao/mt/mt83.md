### CHAPTER LXXX.

A state may be small, and the population sparse, yet the people should
be taught not to rely on force; they should be made to comprehend the
gravity of death, and the futility of emigration. Then, though they had
boats and carts, they would have no use for them; though they had armor
and weapons they would not display them. They should be taught to return
to the use of the quippo; to be content with their food, their clothing,
their dwellings, and to be happy in their traditions. Though neighboring
states were within sight, and the people should hear the barking of
their dogs and the crowing of their cocks, they would grow old and die
without visiting them. <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261)

Better be a hermit, minus the comforts of civilization, than a
millionaire chained to many earthly possessions. Montaigne nobly says,
"Let us betimes bid our company farewell … We should reserve a
storehouse for ourselves, and wholly free, wherein we may hoard up and
establish our true liberty and principal retreat and solitariness."
"Jesus said unto Him, If thou wouldst be perfect, go sell

that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
heaven; and come follow me." "A man's life consisteth not in the
abundance of things which he possesseth."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_261"></span>[129:1](mt83.htm#fr_261) Su-cheh sums up the
chapter in a sentence—"If the inner brings satisfaction, the outer will
have no attractions."

A native paper laments the degeneracy of present times in the following
language: "In ancient times men lived in caves and holes of the earth.
They wore leaves for clothing. They used earthenware of the rudest
description, their carts had no tires, to record events they simply
knotted a cord. In ancient times sovereign and people all sat on mats on
the floor. In ancient times the sovereign invited some one to take his
place while he retired. The feudal system prevailed. Now every one of
these customs is obsolete, and we all know what we have at the present
day."—*Su Pao*.

The Sri Bhagavat says: "While there is the bare ground, why labor for
beds? While there is your own arm, why labor for a pillow? While the
palms of your hands may be joined, why trouble yourself for dishes and
platters? While there are barks on trees, why labor for
raiment?'—*Dialogues on The Hindu Philosophy* by *Rev. K. M. Banerjèa*,
p. 24.
