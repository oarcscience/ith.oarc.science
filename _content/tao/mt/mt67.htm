<p>Whatever is at rest can easily be taken in hand; while yet no omens have appeared plans can be easily formed.</p>  
<p>What is brittle is easily broken; what is minute is easily scattered.</p>  
<p>Act before necessity arises; regulate before disorder commences.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The trunk that can scarcely be embraced sprang from a tiny shoot; the tower that is nine stories high was raised from a mound of earth; the journey of a thousand li&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> commenced when the foot was placed on the ground.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Who makes, mars; who grasps, loses.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The Holy Man practises non-action, hence he never injures; he never grasps, hence he never loses. The majority are too eager for results in attending to their affairs, and spoil everything. There would be no such failures were they as cautious at the end as at the beginning.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Hence the Holy Man desires passionlessness;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> he does not prize articles that are rare; he</p>

<p><div style="font-size: 90%">"Think not," said the Lord Jesus, "that I came to destroy the law or the prophets; I came not to destroy, but to fulfill." There is a natural development which cannot be disturbed without producing injurious reactions. Whoever, therefore, takes upon himself the office of a teacher assumes a responsibility which is heavy. The words of the Lord to Peter are, when rightly comprehended, awful enough to warn off all but the most Spirit-pressed from attempting to preach to their fellow-men. "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." We dare not refuse our aid and guidance, but it requires omniscience to offer it as it ought to be given. By practising non-action the wise man promotes development without marring it with the impress of his own personality.</div></p>
