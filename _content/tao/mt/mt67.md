### CHAPTER LXIV.

Whatever is at rest can easily be taken in hand; while yet no omens have
appeared plans can be easily formed.

What is brittle is easily broken; what is minute is easily scattered.

Act before necessity arises; regulate before disorder commences. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_209)

The trunk that can scarcely be embraced sprang from a tiny shoot; the
tower that is nine stories high was raised from a mound of earth; the
journey of a thousand li <span id="fr_210"></span>[2](#fn_210) commenced
when the foot was placed on the ground. <span
id="fr_211"></span>[3](#fn_211)

Who makes, mars; who grasps, loses. <span
id="fr_212"></span>[4](#fn_212)

The Holy Man practises non-action, hence he never injures; he never
grasps, hence he never loses. The majority are too eager for results in
attending to their affairs, and spoil everything. There would be no such
failures were they as cautious at the end as at the beginning. <span
id="fr_213"></span>[5](#fn_213)

Hence the Holy Man desires passionlessness; <span
id="fr_214"></span>[6](#fn_214) he does not prize articles that are
rare; he

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

studies to be unlearned; <span id="fr_215"></span>[7](#fn_215) he
reverts to that which the masses pass by. In this way he promotes the
natural development of all things without venturing to interfere.

<div style="font-size: 90%">

"Think not," said the Lord Jesus, "that I came to destroy the law or the
prophets; I came not to destroy, but to fulfill." There is a natural
development which cannot be disturbed without producing injurious
reactions. Whoever, therefore, takes upon himself the office of a
teacher assumes a responsibility which is heavy. The words of the Lord
to Peter are, when rightly comprehended, awful enough to warn off all
but the most Spirit-pressed from attempting to preach to their
fellow-men. "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." We dare
not refuse our aid and guidance, but it requires omniscience to offer it
as it ought to be given. By practising non-action the wise man promotes
development without marring it with the impress of his own personality.

"Desire is guided from without, will from within."—*Ancient Wisdom*. p,

"One should neither rejoice at obtaining what is pleasant, nor sorrow in
obtaining what is unpleasant."—*Bhagavad Gita*.

"One who has self-control, looks within at his mind, and in his mind
there is no mind; he looks at his form, and in his form there is no
form; he looks further and observes Nature, and in Nature there is no
Nature."—*The Classic of Purity*.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[109:7](mt67.htm#fr_215) The student will here
recall Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa (born near Treves A.D. 1401, died 1473)
and his favorite phrase "learned ignorance," or "learned not-knowing."
Wisdom is from within, it is born of the spirit; intellect is from
without, it leads to superstition.

"If thou wilt know or learn anything profitably, desire to be unknown,
and to be little esteemed."—*Thomas à Kempis*.
