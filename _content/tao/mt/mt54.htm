<p>What the Tao produces and its energy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> nourishes, nature forms and natural forces establish. On this account there is nothing that does not honor the Tao and reverence its energy. This honor and reverence are spontaneous, not the result of a mandate.</p>  
<p>So the Tao produces. Its energy nourishes, increases, feeds, establishes, matures, controls, broods over. It produces, but keeps nothing for itself; acts, but does not depend on its action; increases, but does not insist on having its own way. This indeed is the mystery of energy.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p><div style="font-size: 90%"><div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lark<br> Soars up and up, shivering for very joy;<br> Afar the ocean sleeps; white fishing gulls<br> Flit where the strand is purple with its tribe<br> Of nested limpets; subject creatures seek<br> Their loves in wood and plane&#8212;and God renews<br> His common rapture."</div></p>  
<p>Professor Drummond expresses the innerness of this chapter when he writes&#8212;"Are we quite sure, that what we call a physical world, is, after all a physical world? The preponderating view of science at present is that it is not. The very term 'natural world,' we are told, is a misnomer; that the world is a spiritual world, merely employing 'matter' for its manifestation." "Raise the stone and there thou shalt find me, cleave the wood and there am I." <i>Sayings of our Lord</i>. (Logion v.)</div></p>

"That which below produces the grain, and above becomes the stars, that which circulates through heaven and earth, is called the Divine Energy."&#8212;<i>Kuan-tzu</i> Wu-ch&#8217;eng in his commentary refuses to distinguish between the Tao and its energy. cf. <i>Eph</i>. iv, 6.</P>
