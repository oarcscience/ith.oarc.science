### CHAPTER LV.

Who cherishes energy in abundance is comparable to an infant child.
Poison insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him;
birds of prey will not strike him. <span id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_177)

His bones are weak; his sinews pliable; his grip firm; <span
id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_178) unconscious of sex, his virility is
active <span id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_179)—the excellency of his
physique. He may cry all day without becoming hoarse—this is the
consummation of harmony.

Knowledge of harmony is called 'The Unalterable'; <span
id="fr_180"></span>[4](#fn_180) knowledge of the Unalterable is called
'Illumination.'

Increase of life is called infelicity, the resting of the mind in the
vitality of form is called animality.

The corporeal begins to age as it nears its prime. This indeed is not
the Tao. What is not the Tao soon ends. <span

"The Great Man never loses his child's heart," says Mencius, and Lao-tzu
in language which is both quaint and suggestive expands the same
thought. The infant has neither the desire nor the ability to appreciate
sensuous pleasure. It may cry all day and not become hoarse. It lacks
that passionate vehemence which would produce exhaustion after a similar
effort by an adult. Its innocence and its weakness are its strength. It
receives no harm from poisonous

insects, fierce beasts, or cruel birds—the lusts and passions of the
animal man. Without prejudices, the infant seeks only that which is
essential, "mother's milk," indifferent whether it comes from this
woman, or from that. Its inner harmony is undisturbed. Its bodily organs
are perfect; the years add nothing to them, but only develop their
functions, but do not add to them. "Except ye turn and become as little
children, ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven." <span
id="fr_182"></span>[\*](#fn_182)

Says the Indian Gita (the Lord's Song): "The contacts of the senses, O
son of Kuntî, giving cold and heat, pleasure and pain, they come and go,
impermanent; endure them bravely, O Bhârata. The man whom these torment
not, O chief of men, balanced in pain and pleasure, steadfast, he is
fitted for immortality." <span id="fr_183"></span>[†](#fn_183) *He has
escaped from that which* "*is not the Tao*."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_177"></span>[93:1](mt58.htm#fr_177) Hsü-hui-hi explains
this to mean that nature will cease to be inimical to man when man
ceases to injure Nature. Cf. *chap*. [50](mt53.htm#an_ch_50).

<span id="fn_178"></span>[93:2](mt58.htm#fr_178) "A curious anticipation
of recent scientific investigation into the clinging power of new-born
infants."—*Maclagan*.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[93:3](mt58.htm#fr_179) "Baby boys before
emptying the bladder are frequently troubled with erections, which is
here misinterpreted as a symbol of vigor."—*Carus*.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[93:4](mt58.htm#fr_180) See conclusion of chap.
[52](mt55.htm#an_ch_52). Also comp. chap. [16](mt19.htm#an_ch_16).

<span id="fn_181"></span>[93:5](mt58.htm#fr_181) The two concluding
paragraphs express the opposite of the eternal, or unalterable. The
conclusion of this chapter is almost identical with that of chap.
[30](mt33.htm#an_ch_30).
