### CHAPTER LXXIX.

To compromise a great hate leaves ill-will behind; that only is a
blessing which produces tranquillity.

Therefore the Holy Man does not pry into other people's affairs, <span
id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_256) even when he holds the left-hand
bond, <span id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_257) possessing the attributes of
the Tao, he quietly holds his own; he who lacks the qualities of Tao
strives to put everybody right. <span id="fr_258"></span>[3](#fn_258)

It is heaven's way to be without favorites, <span
id="fr_259"></span>[4](#fn_259) and to be always on the side of the good
man. <span id="fr_260"></span>[5](#fn_260)

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The wise man is more concerned with the steadiness and direction of his
own thoughts than with the actions of others. By his care to be himself
unsullied to the very innermost recesses of his being, he purifies the
atmosphere wherever he goes, and accomplishes more than he could were he
ever reproaching what he considers untimely. Therefore the cry of the
Hebrew prophet, "Be ye clean ye that bear the vessels of the Lord."
(Isa. lii, 11.)
