### CHAPTER V.

Nature is non-benevolent. It regards all things as straw dogs. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17)

The Holy Man is non-benevolent. <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18) He
regards the masses as straw dogs.

The space between the Heaven and the earth is like a bellows; though
unsupported, it does not warp; when in motion the more it expels. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[3](#fn_19)

Though words could exhaust this theme, they would not be so profitable
as the preservation of its inner essence. <span

Nature cares as little for the divisions among men as the ancient
Chinese worshippers for the straw dogs which had served their
sacrificial functions. The Law of cause and effect, order and sequence
(karma), is as exact, universal and scientific in the realm of mind and
spirit as in the domain of physics and mathematics. Every language bears
in its proverbs deep traces of its workings. Solomon's adage, "He that
soweth iniquity shall reap calamity … he that hath a bountiful eye shall
be blessed," has its counterpart in the sayings of all peoples. Say the
Chinese, "Sow beans and

<div style="font-size: 90%">

you will reap beans; plant melons and you will reap melons. One cannot
plant bitter gourds and reap sweet tasting fruit." "Heaven is bountiful
to all according to their deserts; on the good it showers felicities, on
the not good it inflicts calamity." But though man may not escape the
Law, man can deprive it of evil by his attitude towards its results.
Hence worshipful humility is more fitting than argument. "Stand in awe
and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still."
"The Lord is in his holy temple: be silent before him all the earth."
The solemn mysteries of life are not to be profaned.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_17"></span>[9:1](mt08.htm#fr_17) "Before the grass-dogs are
set forth (at the sacrifice) they are deposited in a box or basket and
wrapped up with elegantly embroidered cloths, while the representative
of the dead and the officer of prayer prepare themselves by fasting to
present them. After they have been set forth, however, passersby trample
on their heads and backs, and the grass-cutters take and burn them in
cooking. This is all they are good for." Chuang Tzu.

Says the Yin-fu-king: "Heaven's greatest mercy is that it is without
mercy." See I. Pet. 1-17. Cp. [*Tao-teh-king*](errata.htm#2), ch.
[49](mt52.htm#an_ch_49).

<span id="fn_18"></span>[9:2](mt08.htm#fr_18) Comp. Mr. Sinnett's
description of the Adept or Mahatma—"He has attained that love of
humanity as a whole which transcends the love of the Maya or illusion;"
i.e., he regards all with equal impartiality.—*Esoteric Buddhism*.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[9:3](mt08.htm#fr_19) The Chinese explanation is
that the seasons follow each other with unvarying regularity, ever
pouring forth new forms of life from its bellows like a mouth providing
the wicked and the good alike with all that they require. Cp. Matt. v.
45.

The esotericist will probably be reminded here of *Bhuvarloka*. See
*Secret Doctrine*, vol. 3, p. 568, et seq.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[9:4](mt08.htm#fr_20) "To thee silence is
praise, O God."—Delitzsch's translation of Psalm lxv. 1.
