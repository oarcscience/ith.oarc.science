### LXXVIII

### TRUST AND FAITH

In the world nothing is more fragile than water, and yet of all the
agencies that attack hard substances nothing can surpass it.

Of all things there is nothing that can take the <span id="page_51">p.
51</span> place of Tao. By it the weak are conquerors of the strong, the
pliable are conquerors of the rigid. In the world every one knows this,
but none practice it.

Therefore the wise man declares: he who is guilty of the country's sin
may be the priest at the altar. He who is to blame for the country's
misfortunes, is often the Empire's Sovereign. True words are often
paradoxical.
