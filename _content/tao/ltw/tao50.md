### L

### ESTEEM LIFE

Life is a going forth; death is a returning home. Of ten, three are
seeking life, three are seeking death, and three are dying. What is the
reason? Because they live in life's experience. (Only one is immortal.)

I hear it said that the sage when he travels is never attacked by
rhinoceros or tiger, and when coming among soldiers does not fear their
weapons. The rhinoceros would find no place to horn him, nor the tiger a
place for his claws, nor could soldiers wound him. What is the reason?
Because he is invulnerable.
