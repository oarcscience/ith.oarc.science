<p>Even successful arms, among all implements, are unblessed. All men come to detest them. Therefore the one who follows Tao does not rely on them. Arms are of all tools unblessed, they are not the implements of a wise man. Only as a last resort does he use them.</p>  
<p>Peace and quietude are esteemed by the wise man, and even when victorious he does not rejoice, because rejoicing over a victory is the same as rejoicing over the killing of men. If he rejoices over killing men, do you think he will ever really master the Empire?</p>  
<p>In propitious affairs the place of honor is the left, but in unpropitious affairs we honor the right.</p>  
<p>The strong man while at home esteems the left as the place of honor, but when armed for war it is as though he esteems the right hand, the place of less honor.</p>  
<p>Thus a funeral ceremony is so arranged. The place of a subordinate army officer is also on the left and the place of his superior officer is on the right. The killing of men fills multitudes <a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></A> with sorrow; we lament with tears because of it, and rightly honor the victor as if he was attending a funeral ceremony.</p>
