### XXV

### DESCRIBING THE MYSTERIOUS

There is Being that is all-inclusive and that existed before Heaven and
Earth. Calm, indeed, and incorporeal! It is alone and changeless!

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Everywhere it functions unhindered. It thereby becomes the world's
mother. I do not know its nature; if I try to characterize it, I will
call it Tao.

If forced to give it a name, I will call it the Great. The Great is
evasive, the evasive is the distant, the distant is ever coming near.
Tao is Great. So is Heaven great, and so is Earth and so also is the
representative of Heaven and Earth.

Man is derived from nature, nature is derived from Heaven, Heaven is
derived from Tao. Tao is self-derived.
