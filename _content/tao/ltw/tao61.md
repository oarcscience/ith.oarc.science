### LXI

### THE TEH OF HUMILITY

A great state that is useful is like a bond of unity within the Empire;
it is the Empire's wife.

The female controls the male by her quietude and submission. Thus a
great state by its service to smaller states wins their allegiance. A
small state by submission to a great state wins an influence over them.
Thus some stoop to conquer, and others stoop and conquer.

Great states can have no higher purpose than to federate states and feed
the people. Small states can have no higher purpose than to enter a
federation and serve the people. Both alike, each in his own way, gain
their end, but to do so, the greater must practice humility.
