### II

### SELF-DEVELOPMENT

When every one recognizes beauty to be only a masquerade, then it is
simply ugliness. In the same way goodness, if it is not sincere, is not
goodness. So existence and non-existence are incompatible. The difficult
and easy are mutually opposites. Just as the long and the short, <span
id="page_12">p. 12</span> the high and the low, the loud and soft, the
before and the behind, are all opposites and each reveals the other.

Therefore the wise man is not conspicuous in his affairs or given to
much talking. Though troubles arise he is not irritated. He produces but
does not own; he acts but claims no merit; he builds but does not dwell
therein; and because he does not dwell therein he never departs.
