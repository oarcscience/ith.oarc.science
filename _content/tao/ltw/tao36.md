### XXXVI

### EXPLANATION OF A PARADOX

That which has a tendency to contract must first have been extended;
that which has a tendency to weaken itself must first have been strong;
that which shows a tendency to destroy itself must first have been
raised up; that which shows a tendency to scatter must first have been
gathered.

This is the explanation of a seeming contradiction: the tender and
yielding conquer the rigid and strong (*i.e.*, spirit is stronger than
matter, persuasion than force). The fish would be foolish to seek escape
from its natural environment. There is no gain to a nation to compel by
a show of force.
