<p>My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice, yet in all the world no one appears to understand them or to practice them.</p>  
<p>Words have an ancestor (a preceding idea), deeds have a master (a preceding purpose), and just as these are often not understood, so I am not understood.</p>  
<p>They who understand me are very few, and on that account I am worthy of honor. The wise man wears wool (rather than silk) and keeps his gems out of sight.</p>
