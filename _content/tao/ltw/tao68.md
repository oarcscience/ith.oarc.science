### LXVIII

### COMPLIANCE WITH HEAVEN

He who excels as a soldier is the one who is not warlike; he who fights
the best fight is not wrathful; he who best conquers an enemy is not
quarrelsome; he who best employs people is obedient himself.

This is the virtue of not-quarreling, this is the secret of bringing out
other men's ability, this is complying with Heaven. Since of old it is
considered the greatest virtue (teh).
