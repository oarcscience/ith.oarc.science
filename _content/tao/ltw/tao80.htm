<p>In a small country with few people let there be officers over tens and hundreds but not to exercise power. Let the people be not afraid of death, nor desire to move to a distance. Then though there be ships and carriages, they will have no occasion to use them. Though there be armor and weapons there will be no occasion for donning them. The people can return to <a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></A> knotted cords for their records, they can delight in their food, be proud of their clothes, be content with their dwellings, rejoice in their customs.</p>  
<p>Other states may be close neighbors, their cocks and dogs may be mutually heard, people will come to old age and die but will have no desire to go or come.</p>
