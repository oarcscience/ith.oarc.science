### XXVI

### THE VIRTUE (TEH) OF DIGNITY

The heavy is the root of the light; the quiet is master of motion.
Therefore the wise man in all the experience of the day will not depart
from dignity. Though he be surrounded with sights that are magnificent,
he will remain calm and unconcerned.

How does it come to pass that the Emperor, master of ten thousand
chariots, has lost the mastery of the Empire? Because being flippant
himself, he has lost the respect of his subjects; being passionate
himself, he has lost the control of the Empire.
