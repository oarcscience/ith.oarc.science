### XXXVIII

### A DISCUSSION ABOUT TEH

Essential teh makes no show of virtue, and therefore it is really
virtuous. Inferior virtue never loses sight of itself and therefore it
is no longer virtue. Essential virtue is characterized by lack of
self-assertion (wu wei) and therefore is unpretentious. Inferior virtue
is acting a part and thereby is only pretense.

Superior benevolence in a way is acting but does not thereby become
pretentious. Excessive righteousness is acting and does thereby become
pretentious. Excessive propriety is acting, but where no one responds to
it, it stretches its arm and enforces obedience.

Therefore when one loses Tao there is still teh; one may lose teh and
benevolence remains; one may forsake benevolence and still hold to
righteousness; one may lose righteousness and propriety remains.

Propriety, alone, reduces loyalty and good faith to a shadow, and it is
the beginning of disorder. Tradition is the mere flower of the Tao and
had its origin in ignorance.

Therefore the great man of affairs conforms to the spirit and not to
external appearance. He goes on to fruitage and does not rest in the
show of blossom. He avoids mere propriety and practices true
benevolence.
