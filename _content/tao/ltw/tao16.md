### XVI

### RETURNING TO THE SOURCE

Seek to attain an open mind (the summit of vacuity). Seek composure (the
essence of tranquillity).

All things are in process, rising and returning. Plants come to blossom,
but only to return to the root. Returning to the root is like seeking
tranquillity; it is moving towards its destiny. To move toward destiny
is like eternity. To know eternity is enlightenment, and not to
recognize eternity brings disorder and evil.

Knowing eternity makes one comprehensive; comprehension makes one
broadminded; breadth of vision brings nobility; nobility is like heaven.

The heavenly is like Tao. Tao is the Eternal. The decay of the body is
not to be feared.
