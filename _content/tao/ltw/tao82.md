### VALEDICTORY

### PART OF THE 20<sup>TH</sup> SONNET

Common people are joyful; they celebrate a feast day; they flock to a
pavilion in spring time. I alone am calm, as one who has as yet received
no omen; I am as a babe who has not learned to smile. I am forlorn, like
a homeless wanderer! Common people have plenty; I alone am in want. I am
a foolish man at heart! I am <span id="page_53">p. 53</span> ignorant.
Common people are vivacious and smart, I alone am dull and confused.

Knowledge of the Tao, how vast! I am like a sailor far beyond a place of
anchorage, adrift on a boundless ocean. Common people are useful, I am
awkward. I stand in contrast to them--but oh, the prize I seek is food
from our Mother Tao!
