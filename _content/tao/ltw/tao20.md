### XX

### THE OPPOSITE OF THE COMMONPLACE

Avoid learning if you would have no anxiety. The "yes" and the "yea"
differ very little, but the contrast between good and evil is very
great. That which is not feared by the people is not worth fearing. But,
oh, the difference, the desolation, the vastness, between ignorance and
the limitless expression of the Tao.

(*The balance of this sonnet is devoted to showing the difference
between the careless state of the common people and his own vision of
the Tao. It is one of the most pathetic expressions of human loneliness,
from lack of appreciation, ever written. It is omitted here that it
might serve for the closing sonnet and valedictory*.)
