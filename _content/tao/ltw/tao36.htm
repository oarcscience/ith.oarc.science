<p>That which has a tendency to contract must first have been extended; that which has a tendency to weaken itself must first have been strong; that which shows a tendency to destroy itself must first have been raised up; that which shows a tendency to scatter must first have been gathered.</p>  
<p>This is the explanation of a seeming contradiction: the tender and yielding conquer the rigid and strong (<i>i.e.</i>, spirit is stronger than matter, persuasion than force). The fish would be foolish to seek escape from its natural environment. There is no gain to a nation to compel by a show of force.</p>
