DISSERTATION ON  
GENERALSHIP AND PREVENTION OF ANARCHY

{[notes](tgln1.htm#7)\|[elucidations and analyses](tgln2.htm#7)}

   *Kao Yu's explanation of the title Ping Lueh (\#\#\#) is: Military
functions are for defence against incipient anarchy (nip it in the bud),
consonant with the Chinese saying \#\#\# 'take it before it comes on.'
To do this well lies in tactics.*

   In ancient times the military was employed neither for the
enlargement of territory, nor for lust of gain, but

|                                    |
|------------------------------------|
| **Military defensive in purpose.** |

rather its use arose from the wish, either to preserve decaying houses,
to continue the succession of some dynasty, or the pacification of
rebellious people and the elimination of the perils that afflicted the
people.

   All creatures of flesh and blood are endowed with teeth, horns,
claws, or heels. Those with horns butt;

|                                |
|--------------------------------|
| **Animals endowed with arms.** |

those with teeth bite; those with venom poison; and those with heels
kick. They like to play and gambol when pleased, and to hurt when angry.
This is nature.

   The appetites of man demand food and clothes: and since there are not
enough for them all, they congregate in

|                       |
|-----------------------|
| **Social struggles.** |

communities, in various clans, high and low, in different places. When
goods are unequally distributed, contending communities struggle for
possession; and it follows that the strong oppress the weak, and the
bold terrorize the timid.

   Since man is without the strong muscle and bone of the animals, and
lacks the advantages of tooth and claw, <span id="page_183">p.

|                                    |
|------------------------------------|
| **Sage works for social justice.** |

he therefore cuts hide for armour and makes swords of iron. And it comes
to pass that the greedy and gluttonous rob and despoil others,
disturbing the tranquillity of the world. Anon, the wise man, grieved,
appears to quell the rapacity of the unruly, to bring peace to disturbed
peoples and to define the path of duty. He extirpates the dangerous and
exterminates the foul, thus making the turbid clear and the perilous
places safe. In this way a peaceful settlement is obtained.

   The origin and sources of militarism are to be found in the distant
past. Huang Ti, once upon a time, warred

|                                |
|--------------------------------|
| **Soldiers were for defence.** |

against Yen Ti, in the deserts of Cho Lu. Chuen Hsü made war on Kung
Kung. Yao fought against the unrighteous king on the banks of the Tan
river. Yao punished the Three Aborigines.<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](tgln1.htm#7_note_1) Ch‛i fought Yu Hu. From the era
of the Five Emperors, the land has not been free from the clash of arms,
especially in times of decay and degeneration.

   Now the reason for the existence of soldiers arose from the necessity
of preventing lawlessness and the

|                           |
|---------------------------|
| **To quell the lawless.** |

quelling of anarchy. Because Yen Ti was a fire-pest, he was captured by
Huang Ti. And Kung Kung was slain by Chuan Hsü, because he was corrupt
as the guardian against floods. These culprits had the knowledge of
truth and the guidance of morals; but since they refused to be led by
such, they were disciplined by the majesty of power. Unsubmissive to the
power of majesty, they were coerced by military force. These were the
principles on which the Sage Kings acted in the employment of soldiers.
The method may be compared to the combing of the hair, and the hoeing of
the ground. The elimination was that of weeds only. The hurt from this
was little; the advantage was great.

   No crimes are greater than the killing of the innocent, and the
feeding of a lot of unprincipled rulers. There can be no calamity
greater than the grabbing of territory, done <span id="page_184">p.

|                                       |
|---------------------------------------|
| **When bad men held military power.** |

in order to satisfy the lust of an ambitious individual. Take the case
of Chieh of Hsia and that of Chou of Yin. If they had been taken in hand
immediately, when the people began to suffer, it would have never come
about that a person would be roasted on hot irons, as happened after the
iniquitous reign had gone on for long. Again if Li of Tsin and Kang of
Sung, who lost their lives and ruined their countries by unprincipled
acts, had been arrested early in their evil course, it could never have
come

|                                   |
|-----------------------------------|
| **Execution of kings justified.** |

about that they robbed in their aggression and in their violence as they
did. Anarchy of the realm causes general suffering to the people. One
man, by pandering to his vicious desires, fills the land with woe. Such
outrages are intolerable to the law of Heaven.

   The restraint of violence and the punishment of anarchy are the prime
reasons for the establishment of

|                             |
|-----------------------------|
| **Kings set up for order.** |

kings. But it has come about that kings take up advantage of the might
of the myriad people and turn it to an instrument for burdening others,
and use it as an occasion for rapine and slaughter. They play the tiger
and the panther. Is it not justifiable, then, to exterminate such
monsters? If you want to breed

|                                 |
|---------------------------------|
| **Tyrants to be exterminated.** |

fish in a lake, you must first destroy the otters. If you wish to breed
animals, you must first destroy the wolves. How much more is such a
course necessary in the case of shepherding the people!

   Hence the militarism of the autocrat and king was a matter of anxious
consideration by conference, of arrangement by plans, and of support by
justice. The object was not to overthrow the existing but to keep waning
powers alive. Therefore, when it was heard that the prince of an enemy
country was adding oppression to oppression on his people, troops were
put in motion and came to the confines of his country. He was
reprimanded for his injustice, <span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

|                                        |
|----------------------------------------|
| **Just to discipline unruly princes.** |

and rebuked for his errors. When the army reached his kingdom, the
commandant issued general orders to his troops forbidding the felling of
trees, the injuring of graves, the burning of crops, the destruction of
property, the enslavement of the people, the robbing of animals. An
announcement was also made to the people saying that the prince of their
country was arrogant towards Heaven, a reviler of the spirits, his
judgments were unjust and he killed the innocent. For these crimes he
was doomed by Heaven and hated by the people. The army had come to oust
the unrighteous prince and put a righteous one in his place. Whoever
trespasses against the law of Heaven is the leader of traitors to the
people. He himself must die and his clan be exterminated. A family
giving ear to the proclamation would have a family's reward; a hamlet
would have a hamlet's; a village a village's; a district a district's.

   The country that surrenders will have its freedom. In a word, the
punishment of the kingdom shall not fall

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Banish a bad prince but treat his people kindly.** |

on the people. With the punishment of the king, and a change of
government, the gentry shall be honoured, the worthy employed, the
orphans and widows shall be cared for, and kindness shown to the poor
and needy. Further, innocent prisoners shall be released and the
meritorious shall be rewarded. Such justice and clemency will ensure the
allegiance of the people, who will open their doors to the invading army
and await its coming. Tribute will be willingly given in grain and
goods. The people's only fear will be lest it should not come. Such were
the principles by which Tang and Wu won the kingship, and the method by
which Duke Huan<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](tgln1.htm#7_note_2) of Ch‛i
became the leader of the hegemony and autocrats.

   We thus clearly see that when a king is without the Tao, his subjects
look on the invading soldiers even as the parched land looks for rain
and the thirsty long for water. When just soldiers, therefore, come,
there would be no war.

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

   The soldiers of later times, in every case, even when the king is
without the Tao, dig moats and trenches; they

|                           |
|---------------------------|
| **Altruistic idea lost.** |

hold the bastions and guard the city. The invading army comes to the
attack with an aim of conquest and aggrandisement, and not for the
purpose of curbing the wrongdoer and cleaning the land from iniquity.
Thus it is we have come to have slain men in war, and streams of blood
in the daily and continuous sanguingary conflicts. The merits of the
autocrats and kings no longer appear in the world, for the reason that
it is all for self now.

   When the cause of war arises from the lust of territory, it would be
vain to hope for true kingship. He who fights

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **In just war the goodwill of the people essential.** |

for his own self, ends by finding no accruing merit. When, on the
contrary, a case arises which involves the interests of the people all
will help: but an aggressor for personal ends will always be left to his
fate. He who has the goodwill of the people, will be strong in spite of
small resources. The powerful monarch, on the other hand, who has lost
the goodwill of the people, is certain to perish. If an army has lost
the Tao it is weak; if it possesses the Tao, it is strong. If the
commandant loses the Tao, he will be powerless, but if he has the Tao,
he will be proficient. If a country is imbued with the Tao, it will
abide: if it loses the Tao, it will perish.

   What is meant by the Tao? To embody the Round and<span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](tgln1.htm#7_note_3) imitate the Square.<span
id="fr_4"></span>[4](tgln1.htm#7_note_4) It carries the Yin and embraces
the Yang: Its left is soft, its right hard. Its base is dark, its crown
is light. Its transformations are irregular (inconstant). It possesses
the root of the Unity in order to satisfy the whole creation.<span
id="fr_5"></span>[5](tgln1.htm#7_note_5) This is Enlightenment!<span
id="fr_6"></span>[6](tgln1.htm#7_note_6) By "Round" is meant Heaven, and
by "Square," Earth. There is no beginning point in the rotundity of
Heaven; there is no boundary to the squareness of Earth, hence it is not
possible to peer in through its doors. Heaven revolves, bringing
fecundity at every turn; yet it has no <span id="page_187">p. 187</span>
shape or form. Earth begets and nourishes boundlessly. Profound and
exuberant! Who can sound the depths of their resources? Every created
thing has some beginning. It is the Tao alone that has no beginning. The
reason of its having no beginning is that it has no constant and rigid
form. It revolves, but is inexhaustible, like the Sun and Moon in their
convolutions, like the Spring and Autumn in their sequences, like Day
and Night. When one ends, the other begins. Light is followed by dark.
It is impossible to take count of their records. The Tao creates form,
but is without form itself; and for this reason its work is achieved. It
creates matter, but is not matter: hence it is victorious and is not
subjugated. Destruction

|                  |
|------------------|
| **No war best.** |

is, at best, the soldier's aim. There is yet a better aim still, viz.,
not to have destruction,—to have no war. Therefore the superior soldier
is not harmful, being in line with the Divine afflatus. The tools of war
are not sharpened, yet no enemy dare attack. The great drum is not
brought out from the armoury<span
id="fr_7"></span>[7](tgln1.htm#7_note_7) and there is not one of the
feudal lords but trembles and shows the white feather. They stand in awe
and dare not lift their heads towards the place. Hence he who fights
without going from the temple is the Emperor. He whose virtue is felt
where he goes, is the King. "Warring in the temple" implies the
imitation of the way of Heaven. He whose transforming virtue is felt,
imitates the duties of the four seasons. The practice of a perfect
government within the kingdom leads outside people to long for such
virtue.

|                                            |
|--------------------------------------------|
| **The perfect rule is the way of Heaven.** |

Victory won without drawing the sword, resulting in the obedience of the
Feudatories to their Lord, implies the art of perfect rule. Hence he who
has won the true art of governing is in repose and imitates the way of
Heaven: in action, he follows the way of the Sun and Moon. His anger and
gentleness are consonant with the four seasons: his calls are like peals
of thunder; his voice and spirit are not forced, but harmonious: the
eight tones <span id="page_188">p. 188</span> of harmony never fail to
respond correctly. Everything is in harmony. There is no disobedience to
the five elements. Below are scaly creatures, and above the feathered
tribes:

|                              |
|------------------------------|
| **Perfect order in nature.** |

every twig and leaf throughout creation is arranged, from root to
branch, in the most perfect order. Therefore the creative energy enters
the smallest crevice without force, and fills the largest spaces with
ease: it baptizes the metals and stones with lustre, and all grasses and
trees glisten with its sheen. Even the very tiniest hair is arranged and
the six quarters of the world are stretched by it. There is nothing
discordant. The baptism and the enduements of the Tao penetrate all,
even the tiniest pore. Its triumphant powers are many.

   If there is any miscalculation in archery, the target will never be
hit. If there is any sinew or joint which the Ch‛i horse does not put
into full use, it will never do a thousand *li* in the day. Likewise
failure to obtain victory,

|                                   |
|-----------------------------------|
| **The Tao state need never war.** |

does not happen from any error on the day the drum is sounded, but from
faults of long standing. The preparatory days have been wanting in
discipline. Therefore, the soldiers that are imbued with the Tao,<span
id="fr_8"></span>[8](tgln1.htm#7_note_8) need never send the war chariot
forth; the edge of the sword never need reek with blood; the horse need
not be saddled, nor need the drum have the dust fall from it when
struck, nor the flag be unfurled: the arrows need not leave the quiver;
the seat of government need not be shifted about; the tradesman does not
need to leave his shop nor the ploughman his field.

|                                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| **Unity of purpose gives unity of aid.** |

Why? Because when justice is advertised to the many and the delinquent
is reprimanded for his faults, the powerful state will pay attention,
and the small principality will bow the head, in obedience to the wish
of the people, who desire peace. The reprimand is made and takes
advantage of the strength of the people. For it is to their own
interests, to eliminate wrongs and expel wrongdoers. Identity of <span
id="page_189">p. 189</span> interests brings mutual co-operation:
identity of feeling brings unity of action and mutual achievement. When
there is identity of desire, mutual help follows, and when action is
carried on in the spirit of the Tao, the whole empire is responsive.
When the anxieties of the people are considered, the whole empire will
join in a conflict. The hunter, following the chase, gets every ounce of
strength out of carriage and horse and man: this mutual help comes not
from the fear of punishment but from mutual interest. The roads are
packed with those eager to help. When fellow-passengers on a boat,
crossing the Yangtse meet with a strong wind and rolling billows, then
every son of them, though perfect strangers, joins in helping to keep
the boat from foundering. Their anxiety is common, and so they all
equally strive to save the ship. No mutual exhortation is needed.

   Likewise, the enlightened king in the use of soldiers acts in the
interests of the community and for the

|                                |
|--------------------------------|
| **A disinterested king wins.** |

elimination of the evil in the land. All participate in the benefit. The
people in the service of country are like sons working for the father.
The majesty of action is overwhelming, like a falling mountain or the
rushing torrent from a crumbling dam. No enemy can withstand the onset.
Hence the wise employment of troops consists in their service being for
all, themselves included. The man who is not able to use them is he who
is working for his own personal ends. When used for public ends, there
is nothing they cannot do; when used selfishly, it is but little that
can be accomplished.

   In military governing there are three important points to note. (a)
The highest method of its functions is this,

|                                              |
|----------------------------------------------|
| **Conditions of success unity and loyalty.** |

to regulate and govern the country, to administer justice, to actuate
moral ideas, to establish correct laws, to shut up all avenues of evil,
to keep the community and ministers friendly and the people acting in
concert; <span id="page_190">p. 190</span> high and low, all of one
mind. King and minister must co-operate in their energies, the Feudal
Lords respect such majestic force, and all parts of the empire must
cherish splendid virtue. When such conduct as the above is cultivated in
the Temple,<span id="fr_9"></span>[9](tgln1.htm#7_note_9) even the
distant parts will bend and point to such high examples, and the whole
empire will be responsive. (b) The next step in excellence is this.

|                             |
|-----------------------------|
| **discipline, efficiency.** |

When the territory is wide, the people numerous, the prince virtuous,
the generals loyal, the country rich and the soldiers strong; when
contracts are faithfully kept, and the military is disciplined, then
when the bell tolls and the drum calls to war, the army of the enemy
will flee before battle is joined. (c) The lower method is this. To know
the lie of the land, to be versed in the points of danger and vantage,
to anticipate unexpected situations and be conversant with all methods

|                           |
|---------------------------|
| **strategy and courage.** |

of deployment, to have the drum attached to the arm ready for instant
action; then with naked swords and flying arrows to come out of the
sanguinary battle victorious, trampling the bloody field strewn with
corpses for a thousand *li*, and with the chariots moving about laden
with the dead and wounded, thus winning a decisive battle. This is the
baser use of militarism.

   To-day the empire knows only the application of rules in a
superficial way. There is no application of

|                      |
|----------------------|
| **Aids to victory.** |

fundamental principles. The root is abandoned and the branch alone is
cultivated. The points wherein the military may be of assistance in
victory are many; but the essential points in securing victory are few.
The armour may be strong, the tools sharp, the chariots firm, the horses
excellent, the commissariat full, the soldiers abundant and chariots
many; these things are the army's capital. But the essentials of victory
do not lie in these.

   To be learned in the movements of the heavenly bodies and in the art
of divining the psychology of the soldier <span id="page_191">p.
191</span>

|                             |
|-----------------------------|
| **The Tao of the General.** |

and his destiny; to be versed in strategy;—these are all aids to
warfare: but they are not all. The general's essential of victory lies
in intuitive genius, the endowment of intelligence which is inborn: his
essential is in the Tao that cannot be expressed. It is this which
differentiates him from the multitude.

   Now the utmost care is required in the selection of good officers and
the elimination of the bad. The different

|                             |
|-----------------------------|
| **The choice of officers.** |

duties may be apportioned as follows: Times for movement and rest of
troops; the division of soldiers; the arrangements of companies and
battalions, fitting each and all into the right places; the preparation
for the call of the drum and the unfurling of

|                               |
|-------------------------------|
| **Right man in right place.** |

the flags; these are the duties of the Yü officers. The knowledge of
dangerous and advantageous positions; a survey of the enemy's position
and knowledge of his soldiers and finding out his situation, is the work
of the Scout Master. To find out the conditions of the road for quick
marching and spots where are convenient wells for cooking, are the
duties of the Ssû Kung officers.<span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](tgln1.htm#7_note_10) The care of the commissariat
so that nothing is abandoned in moving camp; the supervision of
conveyances so that there shall be enough without any

|                         |
|-------------------------|
| **Fitness in service.** |

waste; the digging of trenches is the work of the transport officers.
And the relation of these five heads to the General may be compared to
the relation of the arm, hand and leg to the body. Thus there must be a
selection of different abilities to ensure the efficient doing of the
work. There must be instruction in administrative duties; all must be
informed by command: and their service must be similar to the tiger and
the leopard in the use they make of their teeth and claws, or the birds
in the use of the principal feathers of the wings. Nothing and no one
shall be without its place and

|                       |
|-----------------------|
| **Worth in Command.** |

use. Nevertheless these are only the assisting instruments of the
General towards victory, and not the vital instrument by which it shall
<span id="page_192">p. 192</span> be won. Victory and defeat of the army
ultimately lie with the High Authorities. When they are worthy, the
people below will be obedient to those above; and the army will be
strong. When the people are more worthy than their rulers, there will be
a cleavage and an estrangement between them. In that case, the army will
be weak.

   When virtue and justice are enough to influence the whole people of
the empire; when means are sufficient to

|                                 |
|---------------------------------|
| **Essential point of victory.** |

meet all the urgent matters of the empire; when selection of officers is
broad enough to win the approbation of the good; when measures and plans
are made with enough care to know the conditions of strength and
weakness—these measures form the essential points of victory.

   Broad territories and many people are not enough to make a country
strong, nor are a virile soldiery and sharp implements enough to ensure
victory. High walls and deep moats are not enough to supply firm
stability.

|                              |
|------------------------------|
| **Power lies in good rule.** |

Stringent commands and multitudinous punishments are not sufficient to
inspire awe. Given an existing government with good rule, and a country,
though small, will abide; but a rotting government will perish, however
big the country may be.

   The ancient kingdom of Ts‛u embraced the waters of Yuan and Hsiang,
on the South, and on the North it was

|               |
|---------------|
| **Examples.** |

bounded by the waters of Ying and Ssû. On the West, it included the
territories of Shu Tung. On the East, there was Kuo T‛an Huai, with the
waters of Yin and Ju serving as fosses. The Yangtse Chiang and the Han
River were its ramparts and the Teng forests its battlements. High
mountains that sought the clouds and fathomless abysses were its
frontiers. The position of its territories was most advantageous. Its
people were courageous. They had rhinoceros-hides for armour and caps
made of tapir skins. Their spears were long and their claymores were
short. The army vanguard was complete and its rearguard was thick with
the cross-bow. <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> Strong war-chariots
guarded its flanks.

   Speedy as the flying arrow were they. When travelling together, they
sounded like roaring thunder; they were like wind and rain when going in
loose formation. Nevertheless, these formidable troops were annihilated
at Tsui Hsia and their power wrecked at Pei Chu. The powerful Ts‛u,
great of territory, numerous of people, possessed half the empire;
nevertheless its king, Huai Wang feared Meng Chang Chun of the North. He
had to leave his lares and penates and become the slave of the mightier
Ts‛in. His soldiers were captured, his lands were appropriated, and he
died in servitude and never returned home.

   Hu Hai,<span id="fr_11"></span>[11](tgln1.htm#7_note_11) Ch‛in Shih
Huang, the second, held the imperial power of the world. His kingdom was
most wealthy. Where the foot of man went, no spot on which oars plied
the boats but was embraced within his rule. In the pursuit of his
extravagancies and his lusts of eye and ear he exhausted every art. He
never heeded the hunger, poverty and cold of the people. He built myriad
chariots and the famous palace of Ao Fang.<span
id="fr_12"></span>[12](tgln1.htm#7_note_12) He conscripted the youths of
the villages, sending them to disant parts as indentured soldiers. He
exacted taxes, amounting to more than half the nation's wealth. He
drafted people from afar into his service and punished mercilessly any
delinquents. Countless numbers were dying without food and clothes. How
many myriads died daily I do not know. Discontent prevailed throughout
the land. The people had no peace; they were giddy with heat and bent
with hard labour. There was no mutual help between officials and the
common people. Mutual suspicion filled every breast. A rustic, named
Ch‛en Sheng,<span id="fr_13"></span>[13](tgln1.htm#7_note_13) in Ta Tze,
appeared in rebellion, with bared shoulders, proclaiming that he was
establishing the Great Ts‛u. He called, and the whole nation responded
to his call. He had no well-furnished armoury nor trained soldiers with
strong cross-bows and sharp swords. But they made lances of brier and
date trees, fixing into them sharpened iron points. These, alone, were
<span id="page_194">p. 194</span> their weapons. With only such arms
they met an army furnished with lances and cross-bows. They attacked
fortified cities and occupied territories. Everything fell before them.
The people of the whole empire were seething with discontent like
writhing worms. So the rebel army swept all before it. The old order
passed away like a fleeting cloud or a rolling mist. This man, of humble
origin and with such extemporized arms, turned out in the rough, won the
whole land to his cause, which responded to his call, because the hearts
of the people were full of anger and resentment.

   Another example:—When King Wu undertook the chastisement of
Chou,<span id="fr_14"></span>[14](tgln1.htm#7_note_14) he met with
discouraging omens in his enterprise, such as great rains, when he came
to Fan: the head of the Kung mountain collapsed into the river when he
came near. A comet appeared, with its tail pointing to the east, which
seemed to be an omen favourable to Yin (Chow) and indicating that Wu
would be routed. During the war, the elements were boisterous for the
space of ten days, and in the middle of the march, the army was
embarrassed by storms of wind and rain. Nevertheless, those who pressed
on, though not encouraged by rewards, nor laggards urged by the threat
of punishment, succeeded, with but little serious fighting, in winning a
victory that wrested the empire from the hands of Chou. Therefore, we
learn that he who governs well need never fear an enemy: and he who wars
well, on high moral principles, will have no battles to wage. He who is
clear on the doctrine of prohibitions and permissions,<span
id="fr_15"></span>[15](tgln1.htm#7_note_15) on what to open and on what
to close taking the right opportunity and following the popular wish,
wins that day. Therefore, he who would govern well, accumulates virtue.
He is a good general who arouses the spirit of his soldiers. The people
will serve loyally if there is a fund of virtue in the leader, and the
exercise of authority will enhance the power of awe. Therefore, where
the accretion of spirit is slight, the strength for victory will be
small. Where there is a large flow of benevolent virtue <span
id="page_195">p. 195</span> towards people there will be a wide
influence of awe. Where awe prevails there will be strength in the one
and weakness in the other. It follows, then, that a wise general will
first use such methods as exist for weakening the enemy, and only
subsequently should he engage in battle. In which case with less than
half the expenditure of power applied, results will be doubled.

   The territory of Tang was only 70 *li* in extent. It became a kingdom
through the cultivation of virtue. Chih Pei had a 1000 *li* of land, yet
he perished, enfeebled by militarism. So the kingdom of a thousand
chariots expanded through the cultivation of virtue: the kingdom of ten
thousand chariots became extinct through too much inclination to use
military operations. Hence conquering troops must first gain the victory
through well thought out plans, and battle may then be undertaken.
Undisciplined troops go headlong into war and expect victory simply by
an engagement of arms.

   Given equality of virtue<span
id="fr_16"></span>[16](tgln1.htm#7_note_16) in the contending parties,
the victory will lie with the party with most soldiers. Armament

|                         |
|-------------------------|
| **Equality in virtue.** |

being equal, the clever will overcome the stupid: and the man of plans
will beat the man without them. He who would employ troops must
beforehand win his battles in the Sacred Fane.<span
id="fr_17"></span>[17](tgln1.htm#7_note_17) It is from here that victory
is got. Here it is the King weighs whether he or his enemy is the
worthier, and which side has the abler General; whose people is the more
loyal to his sovereign: which of the two has the better rule; which has
husbanded the greater resources; whose officers are the more efficient;
whose implements are the sharper and the best prepared. Hence victory in
decided by the weighing of plans and policy in the Palace of State. When
this is the case, victory is certain, though the field of battle be a
thousand *li* away.

   Visible strongholds are seen of all: there are military works which
are handed on and studied from one age to another. All such are the
visible means of getting a victory. <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>
But he who is apt in these visible things does not stake his all on
them. What he esteems still more is the *tao*. He esteems this because
of its formlessness. Being without material form it cannot be imposed
upon, it cannot be fathomed.<span
id="fr_18"></span>[18](tgln1.htm#7_note_18) Skill may be met by skill;
the form visible can be met with opposition; the appearance of the whole
army may be concealed with ambush; the appearance of arms will be met by
preparation in arms. Movements,

|                   |
|-------------------|
| **The Tao mind.** |

envelopments, feints, withdrawals, can be cunningly met by similar
action. None of these are good. The movements of the Tao-inspired are
like a spirit's emergence and a demon's action, unexpected and sudden,
like the sudden shining of the stars and their sinking into darkness
again; like the rising of the fabulous bird *Luan*, and the excitation
of the *Lin*, like the flight of the phoenix or the ascension of the
dragon. Skilful movement is like the autumn wind, swift like the
electric fish. Similarly the capable commander attacks the leisurely
manner of his opponent with vigorous activity. With abounding vitality
he smothers the crumbling ineptitude of the other; with swiftness he
stifles the slowness of the other: with affluence he controls the hunger
of his enemy. These are the conquering factors. The effect is like water
extinguishing fire; like heat liquefying snow. Thus whatever is done,
succeeds; success follows every action.

   All pervasive through the regions of the mind, the spirit speeds to
the boundless without. The will, active in the invisible world, will
issue forth in most unexpected ways: with power it goes, with suddenness
it comes. There is no divining its movements. It emerges clear and hits
the object truly. The objective of the spirit is known to no mortal. It
is swift as the lightning and rapid as the wind and the rain. It seems
as though it sprang from earth or fell from heaven. Alone it issues,
alone it enters: nothing can withstand it. It is like the shuttle and
the bronze-pointed arrow. There is none to compare with it! Now light,
now dark! Who can know its beginning? <span id="page_197">p. 197</span>
Who can divine its end? Before it is seen, it has already accomplished
its purpose.

   Therefore, he who is a wise leader, when he sees the weak spot of his
enemy, presses on him without rest:

|                                      |
|--------------------------------------|
| **Swift energy of the wise leader.** |

he pursues him without giving him breathing space: he hangs on to him
and does not let him go for a moment. He attacks the enemy when he is
unprepared and falls on him when he least expects it, quick as is the
thunder, which allows no time to stop the ears; swift as the lightning
which gives no time to shield the eyes. The wise leader of troops is
swift as an echo which follows the sound, or as the drum responding to
the tattoo. Dazed, there is no time to rub the eyes, nor space to draw
in the breath after a cry! So when the onset starts, the enemy beholds
the thick host upon him; he has no time to look up to heaven or down to
earth. Hands fail to grasp the lance; the soldier can't even draw out
his sword. Thus, swift as lightning or the sweep of a hot wind, or as
the flame of the fire, or the plunge of a wave, he leaps upon the enemy,
who thus suddenly paralysed, has no way of defending himself, if he
stands still, nor does he know what action to take, if he moves. So with
the tattooing of the drum and the waving of the flag, every obstacle
will be swept away. Nothing under heaven can withstand the awe-inspiring
force; no one will dare to contest and stand against such might! The
attacking power will always overcome the defensive force. He who has
pondered in mind the problems before him, will always conquer the man
who has not thought out his plans.

   The cool soldier is strong. In unity there is strength and
concentrated fierceness: Fearlessness of death and

|                    |
|--------------------|
| **Unity of will.** |

fixity of purpose makes the hero. Hesitation results in defeat, and
divided strength leads to weakness. Hence, he who can sow the seeds of
disintegration in the soldiers of another man and throw hesitation into
the enemy's ranks, will make it possible for the few to overthrow the
many. Where this is impossible, <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> double
the number of soldiers would not he enough to do the work. Thus the
soldiers of Chou had a hundred myriad minds: the three thousand soldiers
of Wu Wang were of one mind. So a thousand soldiers who are of one mind
give a thousand men's strength. But ten thousand soldiers, each of
different mind, will not have the power of one man.

   When general and soldier, officers and people move as one body, the
enemy can be met and engaged in battle.

|                                  |
|----------------------------------|
| **Confidence and Preparedness.** |

Therefore, when plans are fixed and issued, when operations are put in
motion without divided authority, when the General has no doubts on the
plans fixed upon and the soldiers are of one mind, when movements are
without procrastination and waste; when there are no contrary orders and
no empirical attempts, the enemy will be met with vigour, and the
operations will be intense. So the General looks on the people as the
body, and the people regard the General as the heart. Given a sincere
heart, the bodily members will rush on naked steel: but when the heart
hesitates as though in doubt, the bodily members will be confused and
timid. When the heart is divided with contrarieties, the bodily members
will fail to act together. Where there is a lack of perfect sincerity in
the general, the soldiers will be wanting in valour.

   We may say thus, that a good general's soldiers are as the teeth of
the tiger, the horns of the rhinoceros, the feathers of a bird, the legs
of the centipede. They can walk, they can toss, they can bite and they
can butt. Though strong, the enemy will not succeed, though numerous, it
will cause but little injury. The result of unity of heart is mighty!
Where the soldiers sincerely follow the command, they will have no fear,
though few. On the contrary, when they do not follow, sincerely, the
supreme command, they are weak in power, though they be a host in
number. And so when the masses below have no regard for the powers
above, they put no heart into their service. When the soldier has no
fear of the general it will be seen in the <span id="page_199">p.
199</span> demeanour of slackness in battle. There must be the essential
of firmness in defence, and the essential of victory in attack. Without
even awaiting a close engagement, the occasion of success and failure
may verily be learnt from the outward demeanour and conduct of the army.

   An army has three *Influences* and two *Adjustments* (ch‛uan). There
is the *Influence of Morale*, the *Influence of Position*, and the
*Influence* of (*yin*.) *Opportunity*. When

|                       |
|-----------------------|
| **Three Influences.** |

the general is full of courage and despises the enemy, the soldiers go
to battle then really with courage and joy. As the captain of a mighty
host, whose will is as buoyant as the floating cloud, whose spirit is as
resilient as the wafted breeze, whose cry is like the thunder
reverberating, whose accumulated stores of sincerity towards his men, he
will fall on the enemy as an avalanche, with majestic awe. This may be
said to be the *Influence* of *Morale*.

   An exiguous pass, a ferry pontoon, a great mountain, a serpentine
defile, a cul-de-sac, a dangerous pitfall, a narrow ravine, full of
winding ways like the intestines of a sheep, a hole like a fisher's net,
which admits, but from which there is no exit, are situations in which
one man can hold back a thousand. They may be called the *Influence of
Position*. The *Influence of Opportunity* is the tiredness, the
disorder, the hunger and thirst, the coldness, the uncertainty of the
time of attack, unwatchfulness in the time of tent-pegging, or the
striking of the camp, of the enemy.

   Skilful in the use of bluffing and spying, in finding out the
mistakes and in calculating the troubles of the enemy

|                      |
|----------------------|
| **Two Adjustments.** |

and in preparing ambushes and camouflage; concealing one's own movements
and falling on the enemy unawares, so that his soldiers have no means to
prepare against the irruption—all such

|            |
|------------|
| **Power.** |

methods belong to *Influence of Power*, the adjustment of knowledge.

   Correct arrangement of the line of battle; placing picked soldiers in
front: arranging orderly advance and <span id="page_200">p. 200</span>
retreat: disposing of the attacking platoons so that the front and rear
do not tread on each other, or the right and left mutually clash, thus
ensuring few casualties, yet inflicting many on the enemy: such may be
called *Tactics*.

|              |
|--------------|
| **Tactics.** |

Adjustment of tactic power and influence must have expression. In this
way. Officers and soldiers must be allotted, each to his own department.
The selection of the able, the employment of talent, fixing schemes and
perfecting plans, getting the right men for officials, the timely
advance and dismissal of men, carefully thinking out gains and
losses,—these measures will enhance

|                     |
|---------------------|
| **Administration.** |

the spirit of awe. Given these conditions, vigorous attack must be made
without waiting for the armoured chariots and scaling ladders. And thus
the city is taken. To break the enemy even without actual battle at
close quarters, depends on the *essentials* of victory having been
thought out and matured beforehand. War, therefore, must not be
thoughtlessly entered into without the assurance of certain victory.
When victory

|                                       |
|---------------------------------------|
| **Battle joined must be with power.** |

is certain, then the battle may be joined. After the army is put in
motion. The soldiers are massed in order and not scattered about. The
army must never go forth and return without good results. If it does not
move, well! But if it *does* advance, it must do go in a stupendous way.
It must astonish heaven and shake the earth: it must sustain
Taishan<span id="fr_19"></span>[19](tgln1.htm#7_note_19) and startle the
whole world: even the demons must shuffle out of the way: birds and
beasts must be petrified with fear. Thus, stupendously powerful, there
will be no battlefield; for the enemy will not come near. The cities of
the kingdom will need no guards to hold them. Impetuosity will be
controlled by fundamental repose. Disorder will be held in check by
order. By imperturbability of mind the commander calms turbulence, and
by orderly government, he controls disorder.

   The invisible governs all the visible, and *Wu wei*, <span
id="page_201">p. 201</span>

|                               |
|-------------------------------|
| **Wu wei secret of success.** |

*Tao* action, meets every change. Though victory may not be got over the
enemy, yet, there is no way by which the enemy can possibly conquer.

   If the enemy makes the first move, his intentions may be seen. He
being in commotion, and I at rest with the fundamental, has his strength
worn out. When his movements are seen, the possibility of victory may be
controlled. When his strength is on the wane, then will be my chance to
show power. Seeing his movements, I may adapt my plans according to all
his changes. Watching the enemy's weak and strong points, gives me the
control of his life. I offer him the baits which he desires, until he is
satiated with them, and so, when I see any weak spot for an opening, I
rush in to seize the advantage. When his strategy has come to an end,
then I grip him: and when his various schemes are exhausted, then the
opportunity to overthrow him has arrived.

   On the other hand, if the enemy should also resort to non-activity,
he must be met by some exceptional strategy: if he will not come to an
open engagement, then will be the time to perfect plans and wait for him
to engage. If the enemy manoeuvres, in open response to his opponents
movement, which being seen, there may be mutual attempts to circumvent
the rear of each other. When he expects "me" to follow in pursuit of his
feint of deployment, he will naturally concentrate his best soldiers in
one spot; with the result that his army will be thinned in other parts:
when the seasoned soldiers wheel to the left, his right wing (west) will
be endangered. When his troops get separated, then will be the time to
give pursuit. When the enemy is very near and yet shows no sign of
moving to the attack, and he is in a state of lethargy, then is the time
to attack him with a rush like thunder and mow down his troops like
grass and trees. It will be easy work: flash on him like lightning:
accelerate speed with speed. The enemy will have no time to wheel round:
his chariots <span id="page_202">p. 202</span> will be paralyzed. His
troops will be stock-still like trees: his bows will be stiff like rams'
horns: his troops, though multitudinous, will not dare to face "mine" in
battle. Whoever has a full perspective of conditions will gain the
victory. All outward and concrete actions can be countered and met.
Therefore, the wise man conceals the outward expression of purpose
within the *wu*, the invisible, the mind. The mind roams in the region
of the immaterial. Winds and rain can be closed against, but cold and
heat cannot be shut out because they have no form. Now those things that
can penetrate through the minutest pores, (like water through the pores
of blotting-paper) and infiltrate metal and stone and reach to the
utmost distances, and place themselves above the ninth heaven, or
wreathe themselves underground<span
id="fr_21"></span>[21](tgln1.htm#7_note_21) can only do so by *wu
hsing*, the formless.

   A general, able in handling soldiers, should attack the enemy in
disorder, but not attack him when he is in good order. No surprise
attack can be made on a redoubtable army nor an assault carried out
against flags that stand upright and float proudly.

   When the outlook regarding the enemy is not clear, then is the time
to consider the star of destiny<span
id="fr_22a"></span>[22a](tgln1.htm#7_note_22a) in

|                                  |
|----------------------------------|
| **Look to the star of destiny.** |

preparing to meet him. When he seems to be inert, then is the occasion
to overwhelm him. When the enemy seems to be in good luck, then it is
not the time to make a move. If the tiger and the leopard would keep
quiet they would not fall into the pitfall. When the tailed deer and the
stag keep still, they will not get entangled in the snare. When birds
keep

|                        |
|------------------------|
| **Caution in moving.** |

quiet, they will not be caught in the fowlers net. When fish and lobster
keep still, they will not be trapped by hook and gin. Creatures have
never been put in subjection except through movement. Hence the sages
value tranquility. Tranquility, then, can meet turbulence: and the
soldiers who move last can stand against the soldiers who move first.
The diligent will beat the slack: the complete plan will beat the
imperfect plan. <span id="page_203">p. 203</span> Therefore a capable
commander should have his soldiers animated by the same spirit, and by
concentration increase their strength. The brave must not advance alone,
nor the apprehensive retreat without support. When the soldiers halt, it
must be as one, and they must show the firmness of the Ch‛iu<span
id="fr_22"></span>[22](tgln1.htm#7_note_22) mountain. They must deploy
like the wind and rain, simultaneously and vigorously. With such a front
no enemy can stand against them. There is nothing that will not be
broken up by them. On the march and in halting the action must be as of
one man. This attitude is invincible. Many of the enemy may be wounded,
and yet there need not be much hand to hand fighting. To flick with the
fingers is not so deadly as a blow with the fist.

   If a myriad soldiers went out to fight one by one the result would be
feebler than if they went out in squads of

|                            |
|----------------------------|
| **Cooperation essential.** |

hundreds. Tigers and leopards are nimble of body: different kinds of
bears are of great strengh: nevertheless, people eat the flesh of these
and spread their skins on their beds. And the reason is that these
beasts of nimble foot and ferocious strength are not able to use
understanding to unify their strength.

|                                              |
|----------------------------------------------|
| **As a rule the few cannot match the many.** |

The strength of water overcomes fire. The Chung-hua pavilion was on
fire, and a ladle of a pint capacity was used to try and quench the
raging flames. But though all the water in the well and the lake were
ladled out, the effort would be all in vain. If a large kettle and
cauldron-size vessels were used, the fire could be soon extinguished.

   But man vis-à-vis man bears not the mutual relation that fire does to
water. A few men cannot overcome the many. This is evident. The
military, it is true, are fond of saying the few can match the may. But
this saying is for the home consumption of the military. It is not true
in fact. It is not true in the stern test of war. There are times when
the army is big, but of little use: because it is not animated by unity
of spirit. There are times when the soldiers are few, but their
utilities many and <span id="page_204">p. 204</span> great, which comes
from its unity. Nevertheless, were all men on both sides to bring out
and exert the utmost ability of each, and use all their strength, it has
never been known that the few could conquer the many.

   Of all spirits Heaven is the most honoured: in strategy nothing is
superior to a good vantage ground: in movement of troops there is
nothing so urgent as times and seasons. In the use of soldiers, there is
nothing more trenchant that the getting of the right men. These four
points are the pillars and the cardinal principles of military action.
Nevertheless, the Tao must be waited for before any action is taken and
movement begun.

   Now, superior vantage ground is of more importance than times and
seasons. And a skilful plan is even better than superior vantage ground.
Power conquers man. Therefore, he who depends on times may be misled by
appearances: who depends on vantage ground will be too tied down: he who
depends on seasons will be coerced: he who depends on men will be duped.
And courage, benevolence, faith, economy are all the good qualities and
talents of men. Nevertheless, the courageous may be led into error, the
benevolent may be gulled, the man of faith is easily deceived, the
economical man may be easily hoodwinked. Now if a commander of hosts has
all these virtues but should he show any one of them, men will take him
in their schemes. From this we may gather that the soldier must rely on
the tao law<span id="fr_23"></span>[23](tgln1.htm#7_note_23) to control
victory, and not on human talents. This is naturally evident. Therefore,
the long tailed deer may be caught in the land net: the fish and lobster
will be caught in the sea net: the swan and the heron may be shot at by
the bow: since all these are visible objects.<span
id="fr_24"></span>[24](tgln1.htm#7_note_24) What can't be got at are the
invisible things: there is no way of dealing with these. Hence the sage
secretes himself in the 'no source'<span
id="fr_25"></span>[25](tgln1.htm#7_note_25) (even before the pullulating
of visibility): so his will and mind cannot be known. His movements are
in the incorporeal, so his paths are not fathomed and made use of.
Without rules <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> and models, when things
come, they are fittingly met. Without names, without definitions,
changes bring about visible things. Oh how deep! Oh how profound!
Whether it be Winter, Summer, Spring or Autumn, always and ever, the Tao
is higher than the highest Heaven, deeper than the deepest depths. The
fluxes and movements proceed unobstructed without stop. The Tao
establishes the life of man in the spaces of the profound, and buries
his will in the deepest depths. The most clear-sighted cannot penetrate
into his nature. The secret pondering of plans in military things is a
matter of the Tao: charts and maps are of the earthly orders, and
instructions pertain to the human side. Hence, assured victory depends
on the stamp of power. So the commanders of superior quality, in their
use of soldiers, use the highest gift of all which is the way of Heaven.
Then they find the vantage grounds of earth and for the medium they get
the hearts of men. These are put in action with skill and displayed with
power: then the army will not be broken nor the soldiers defeated.

   The commander of second rate quality is not so good. He does not get
the way of Heaven, that is to say, he has none of the secret and
profound thoughts on militarism: nor does he know anything of the
advantages of earth. He looks, wholly, to men and power. Though he may
not get a decisive victory, yet, on the whole, his victories are not a
few.

   The commander of inferior quality is he who gathers wide information
but yet is confused in himself: he knows a lot, but is himself without
resolution. In the camp he is hesitating, in the field he is undecided,
patching up temporary plans and always probing for ways and means.
Therefore he is often in trouble and taken by the enemy.

   Now suppose that two men were engaged in a battle

|                                  |
|----------------------------------|
| **Confidence and boldness win.** |

of swords: they are equal in skill and in the want of it. Thus being
equally matched, what is the reason that the bolder of the two
contestants is sure to win? The simple reason is <span id="page_206">p.
206</span> that he is without uncertainty. He acts with boldness. Again
a big axe is applied to hard varnish-tree wood to get fire wood: suppose
there is no waiting for a propitious day and lucky hour for splitting
it, if the big axe is in contact with the varnish-wood and there is no
man-power behind the axe, and even though the lucky days have been given
and the propitious moment taken, yet it will not be possible to split
that wood because there is no power applied to the axe.

   So a strong current will give energy. A good arrow will go far. But
even if the arrow is made of the finest

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Force and mind must be behind finest tools.** |

bamboo and tipped with silver and lead, yet it will not penetrate even
through a thin felt covering, or an armour made of the rotten leaves of
the lotus, without some force behind it. But if there is muscle and
sinew and the force of the bow string behind it, then it will penetrate
the hide of a rhinoceros and the shield of leather.

   The swiftness of wind will take the roof off a house and break trees:
an empty cart going down or ascending

|                                 |
|---------------------------------|
| **Certain factors in success.** |

a steep hill does so by the help of man. Hence the power of the skilful
commander of troops overflows like water rushing down from a burst dyke
of a myriad feet high or a rock tumbling from a great height. When the
enemy sees that my troops are ready for action and the appearance is not
a mere bluff, who would dare fight against them? A hundred men ready to
die are of more worth than a myriad who are on the point of turning
tail. How much more the weight of three armies which will face water and
fire, and never show the heel! Who would try to seduce them? Who would
try to master them?

   What is meant by astrology is to have the star *Ching Lung* on the
left and *Pai Hu* on the right, the star *Chu Chiao* in front and *Hsuan
Wu* behind.<span id="fr_26"></span>[26](tgln1.htm#7_note_26) What is
meant by a favourable position is to have rising ground behind and flat
terrain in front: to have a mountain on the left and <span
id="page_207">p. 207</span> deep water or valley, on the right. What is
meant by human affairs is that the imperial bounty of land and honours
and money be faithfully done and punishments dealt without favour shown.
There are times for activity and inactivity. Action and non-action
should be with celerity.

   It is quite true that rules and regulations are made by tradition,
but these are not born of tradition but by reason of change according to
times and seasons. Therefore the hour and season may be known from the
shadow in the Ming Tang, Ancestral<span
id="fr_27"></span>[27](tgln1.htm#7_note_27) fane. The cold and heat of
the country is indicated by the level of water in the bottle. But the
interactions of these things are very trifling. Only the Sage can see
their furthest import. The drum is not one of the five tones, but it is
the master sound of all. Water

|                             |
|-----------------------------|
| **Commander stands alone.** |

is not one of the five tastes but it is the medium of blending all. The
Commander-in-chief is not one of the Five Officers of the army, but he
superintends all and has power over all. Therefore, that which is the
master of the five tones is not of them: that which is the medium in the
five tastes has no part in the five tastes: he who controls the five
commandants cannot be fathomed. Therefore, the mind of the
Commander-in-chief is full of ferment like the Spring: it is abundant in
life like the Summer: it is lustrous like the Autumn: uniformly rigid
like the Winter.

   According as the enemy shows himself, so he is to be met, by a change
in disposition. Alteration is made to meet

|                           |
|---------------------------|
| **He matches the enemy.** |

him every time. Now the shadow does not give a straight figure for the
crooked. The echo does not alter the soprano tone into bass. Perceiving
the reasons for the advent of the enemy, he will be more than matched in
everyone of his plans. Therefore, following the right in movement and
going according to reason in every action, the blow will be struck at
the weakest spot, just as the man breaking bamboo will do it at the
joints.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

   The measure of success will be according to resources. The enemy may
know my coming forth, but he will not know the objective of the army.
The enemy may know when the other army starts, but he will not know
where it will settle down. In the beginning, I am like the fox and so
the enemy will come on lightheartedly: but in the engagement I will be
as the rhinoceros and the tiger, making the enemy flee pell-mell.

   When birds advance to the attack there is a hanging down of the head.
In the ravening of fierce beasts there

|                               |
|-------------------------------|
| **Hides his plan and power.** |

is a hiding of the claws. The tiger and the leopard do not show their
claws: and in biting, they do not show the teeth. So the principle of
war is to give the enemy an impression of yieldingness but to receive
him with firmness: to give the impression of weakness, but fall on him
unawares with might: appear to the enemy as though you were few, but put
out your strength when he comes to meet you. When you want to go west,
make as though you were going east. At first look as though you had no
stomach for the fight, but then close up in vigorous action with him. At
first the plan is dark to him, afterwards show its clarity. Be like the
demon that shows no traces of plans, like the water that leaves no mark
of cleavage, when divided. Therefore, where you seem to be making for,
is not the place you arrive at; what is seen is not the real design.
Action and non-action, movement and rest must not be apparent, like the
thunder-clap which comes unawares and can't be prepared for. When the
plan is not a mere repetition of an old one, the victory is a
hundred-fold greater, the commander seeming to be in league with the
genius (spirit); and there is no knowing his mind. This is what is meant
by 'most spiritual' in speaking of a general's schemes. That wherein the
military is mighty is in the people. What makes the people feel ready to
die is a spirit of loyalty to king, and loyalty or patriotism exercised
in action, is inspired by majesty. Hence, the people are instructed by
<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

|               |
|---------------|
| **A genius.** |

ceremonies and united by military awe. This is what is meant by 'victory
must be had.' When majesty and patriotism go hand in hand, and act
*pari-passu*, we have what is called irresistible might.

   What man rejoices in is life: what he hates is death.
Notwithstanding, when the city walls are built high and the moats dug
deep, when arrows and stones fall like rain, when the battle is in
process in the plain and by the broad water, and when naked swords are
flashing, the soldiers vie with one another to be the first in the
fight. It is not because the soldier looks lightly on death or likes to
get wounded; it is the sure reward and the certain punishment that move
him. Therefore, when the ruler looks on those below as sons, then those
below look on those above as father. When the ruler regards the people
as brothers, then the people look on him as the elder brother. When the
ruler looks on the people as sons then he will inevitably exercise the
kingly way over the empire. When the people look on him above as father,
then the empire will necessarily be well governed. When the ruler loves
the people like brothers, then it will not be difficult to get them to
die for him. When the people look on him above as elder brother, it will
not be so difficult for them to sacrifice life. That state will not be
easily attacked where all are father and sons, elder and younger
brothers, since there has already been abundant kindness dispensed. If
on the contrary four horses are unequally matched (i.e. one is slow),
the best driver will not be able to drive the chariot far: if the bow
and arrows are not of the same poise, even a famous archer would not be
sure to hit the centre. If prince and minister lack confidence in each
other, even the famous general Sun Tzû would not be able to meet the
enemy. Wherefore if the government is internally well ordered by an
overflow of goodness, and externally the weak points of danger are
closed up so as to command the awe of aliens, when an examination is
made into who are industrious and who lazy, so that it be known who is
well fed, who hungry, <span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

|                           |
|---------------------------|
| **Officer one with men.** |

then, when the day of battle comes, the soldiers will look on death as
nothing but a going home. Hence the commander must be one with the
soldier in both sweet and bitter experiences, and partake with him of
his cold and hunger. In this way the soldier will go willingly to face
death. So the eminent commander of old necessarily put himself in front
of the soldiers, in war. He had no umbrella in the heat and no furs in
the cold: he faced heat and cold, like a common soldier. He did not ride
in dangerous passes, he dismounted when ascending hills. Thus he put
himself on a level with the soldier whether in action or at ease. When
the army had finished its cooking the commander ventured to eat. After
the army had drawn its water from the well, the commander took his turn
at drinking. Thus in hunger and thirst he was one with the men. When
battle was joined he stood where the arrows flew, and all equally shared
both security and danger. The good commander in his use of

|                        |
|------------------------|
| **Mutual obligation.** |

soldiers, constantly attacked by taking advantage of the accumulated
hatred in the heart of the enemy soldier towards his own superior, also
by the accumulated goodness cherished in the heart of his own soldiers:
his accumulated kindness he used to strike at the accumulated dislike of
the enemy for his superior. So did he win the victory. What the lord
demanded from the people were two things. He asked them to labour for
him and desired them to be ready to give up their lives for him. The
people looked for three things from their lord, viz., that they could
eat when hungry, rest when weary, and be rewarded for merit. If the
people rendered the two services expected of them and the king missed
bestowing the three benefits expected of him, then, in that case, though
the country was large and the soldiers many, nevertheless, the army
would be weak. But if they were assured

|                       |
|-----------------------|
| **Faith to be kept.** |

that they would be certain of his praise in distress, and of the reward
of toil, and remission of the death penalty for valour, and <span
id="page_211">p. 211</span> that their posterity would get its proper
reward after their death they would face any danger. The fidelity of the
king in these four conditions being assured, the soldiers would be
mighty. Though the emperor might be enjoying himself shooting birds in
the high clouds, or fishing in the deep pools, or playing the organ and
the harp, or sounding the bell and the flute, or throwing the dice and
playing chess at home, he could feel confidence that the soldiers in
distant parts would be strong and his commands would be always carried
out. Hence when the emperor could be respected, those below were willing
to serve him: when his virtue was sufficient to command awe, then his
majesty would be established.

   A commander must have three sciences: he must have four loyalties: he
must have five virtues: he must have ten tenacities. *The three sciences
are:* knowledge of the heavenly bodies; acquaintance with the form of
the earth; discernment of the nature of man. *The four loyalties are:*
prosecuting the interests of the kingdom without overtaxing the army;
disregard of bodily ease in service to the king; fearlessness of death
in the face of danger; reliance on his own judgement in a matter of
doubt, without consideration of consequences. *The five virtues are:*
gentleness without being made the catspaw of others; firmness without
being unduly influenced; benevolence without becoming the dupe of men;
sincerity and truthfulness, without being taken in; courage that shall
not be affronted. *The ten tenacities of character are:* purity of soul
that cannot be contaminated; firmness that cannot be shaken; a clear
intelligence that cannot be beclouded; freedom from covetousness and
dissoluteness; mental balance in argument; no dabbling in fortune
telling; no undue mirth; no show of anger. In other words, the mind must
remain calm whatever happens. This state is that which is called
profound. Who is there who could fathom a man with such a nature? When
beginning any undertaking, he inevitably hits the correct balance. His
words are infallibly well weighed, his actions are unfailingly <span
id="page_212">p. 212</span> well-timed, and his decisions are well
reasoned. He seizes the right opportunity for action and inaction. He
sees clearly just when to begin and when to end an affair. He estimates
the advantage or harm of movement and its cessation. He is as swift as
the stretched string of the bow and as strong as the flying arrow; he
moves with the stealth and silence of the dragon and the snake, giving
no clue to his purpose. No one can say where and how he will strike. It
is never known whence he will come nor whither he will end. No one will
be able to stand up against his attack, nor will it be possible for
anyone to break his defences. I have heard that a good commander first
makes his own resources perfect and afterwards considers the conditions
of others. He first sees that his own defences are impregnable and then
seeks victory for his own arms. Well organised himself, he then seeks
victory over the enemy. To go to battle with an enemy, unprepared and in
disorder, would be like trying to extinguish fire with fire or stopping
an overflow with water,—a method which must spell failure. There must be
a dissimilarity in order to gain success. Take the following example.
Suppose a potter dissolved himself into a lump of mud, he could not
possibly, in that condition, make a bowl or a crock. If a woman worker
in silk made herself into silk, she could

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| **There must be a mind behind matter and art.** |

not then weave silk. Articles of the same nature cannot work on each
other. Hence the opposite or contrary must be the complement for work.
Two sparrows fighting, fail to kill one another because of the sameness
of species: but the eagle and falcon arrive and put an end to all, by
eating up both, because of the differentiation in kind. So calmness is
the opposite or contrary of violence: order is the opposite to disorder:
satiety the opposite of hunger: leisure the opposite of labour. But the
difference between the positive and negative is like the difference
between water and fire, metal and wood, female and male. They are unable
to co-exist identically and simultaneously in mutual <span
id="page_213">p. 213</span> contact.

   The wise commander observes the aura of the five elements, viz.,
metal, wood, water, fire, earth, following

|                                |
|--------------------------------|
| **Aura of the five elements.** |

the lucky indications of each in replying to the enemy. Thus he is able
to make his victory complete. The unskilful commander neglects a
concurrence with these five elements. Instead, he adopts the five
deaths—because greed impels him to try and snatch a victory at every
opportunity, without regard to the signs of the indicators. And so he
gets caught in his own net.

   What is important in military affairs is that plans are concealed
from the enemy, and visible movements camouflaged. Attack the enemy
altogether unexpectedly and give him no time to prepare. Once
contemplated plans are made known, their use is finished. When the
visible operation is manifest, then it can be met and controlled. Hence
the skilful commander gets the concealments of "heaven above" and those
offered by "earth below": in between these

|                                |
|--------------------------------|
| **The nature of the terrain.** |

there is the "concealment offered by human affairs." Nothing can
interfere with the concealment through heaven. What is meant by this is,
and may be made plain by examples, from great cold, overpowering heat,
swift winds and violent rain, thick fog, eclipse of the sun. Advantage
may be taken of these in order to do the unexpected. The "concealments
of the earth" are, for example, mountain heights, rising ground,
forests, dangerous defiles, etc. These can be used as cover and ambush
to prevent any outward movement from being seen. "Human concealment" is
when, for example, men hide in the van when the enemy expects him to be
in the rear; or some abnormal action within the line of battle, like an
appearance sudden as a thunder-clap; a stroke swift as pelting rain or
rushing wind, or the rolling up of the

|                            |
|----------------------------|
| **Many helps to victory.** |

flags, the stopping of the beating of the drum, marching under cover, a
movement to which no clue is found. Hence when the van and rear are in
perfect order, the square in perfect line, the <span id="page_214">p.
214</span> marching the dismissal, or falling into line are without
mutual hindrance; to have the wings light is to their advantage. Not to
break the line whether in deployment forward or to the rear, and, in
disbanding, to have like order, is the mark of skill in the organizing
and the training of the regiment. To be versed in the occult, in
geomancy, in the elements that are mutually destructive and the
opposite, in the five elements: to view the weather and read the stars:
to take the horoscope of the tortoise: to divine omens,—all these belong
to transcendental philosophy.

   Then there is the working out of plans and schemes, the lying in
ambush in grass, the use of water and of fire,

|                         |
|-------------------------|
| **Many ways of skill.** |

the introduction of some strange surprises, the cries and shouting of
the army so as to confound the ear of the enemy, the dragging of
branches so as to raise a screen of clouds of dust whereby to bewilder
his eyes. These are the skilful ways of feints and stratagems. To make
defences by planting the mighty hammer, etc., to that the soldiers gain
confidence and are not frightened, the avoidance of bribery by bestowed
of power or advantage, these are skilful ways by means of which to gain
power and fitness. Celerity, swiftness, intrepidity, courage, contempt
of danger and of the enemy are the essentials of surprise attacks. The
survey of the land comprises the erection of serried ranks of huts or
tents, the construction of stockades, the occuption of high ground and
of beacon towers, making sure of the line of communications, and so on,
is what is meant by a skilful use of terrain.

   Take advantage of the enemy's hunger and thirst, of biting cold and
torrid heat, of his labours and fatigue, of his exhaustion and
consequent lack of discipline, of his nervousness, and the afflicted
state of his feet and footwear, and then select your warriors and attack
him in the depth of night. This is the skill which makes use of special
occasions and adapts action to circumstances.

   Ride in chariots where the roads are level: in difficult <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> climbs or winding mountain roads, take to
horse: for the most part use the simple bow (not the crossbow), in
crossing water: and the crossbow when in mountain defiles. Let the
banners fly in the day and light many fires for the night, and in the
twilight let the drums be well sounded. This is the skill used in making
preparations.

   All these eight matters are necessary; not one should be omitted.
Notwithstanding, they are not the most important

|                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **The most important is for the General to have a clear mind.** |

in military affairs. The following are more vital. He who is commanding
should see and know better than any other. He is the only one who sees
what other men don't see, the only one who knows what other men do not
know: the only one who sees what other men don't see means that he may
be said to be clear-minded: knowing what other men don't know, means him
to be mentally penetrating and to have taken the first steps towards
victory. To have a defence that cannot be assaulted, and to be
undefeated in battle, are matters of care in preparation. What is meant
by carelessness is a disunion between those above and those below, viz.,
that the petty officers are not acting together, that treatment is

|                                      |
|--------------------------------------|
| **Preparation and unity of spirit.** |

not just, that there is a growing resentment in the soldiers' minds,
resulting in disobedience. What is meant by care is that the emperor is
clear-minded and the commanders are honest, that superiors and
subordinates are of one spirit and the whole rise and act together. This
is what is meant by "care in preparation." If water is thrown on fire,
what happens is a collapse of the fire: a retreat follows pressure or
coercion. Hardness and yieldingness are mutually incompatible. Victory
is the result of stable equilibrium.

|                                              |
|----------------------------------------------|
| **Victory where the right spirit prevails.** |

When the strong and weak are of dissimilar strength, the victory will
rest with that side which has real strength. Hence successful attack
does not depend on the fewness of soldiers: a skilful defence with the
smallness <span id="page_216">p. 216</span> of the country: victory will
be where awe prevails: defeat follows the loss of the right Spirit. Now
where there is the right spirit, there will be ardent fighting: where
this is lacking there will be flight. Where there is an overflow of
vital unity there will be might: where there is degeneracy and decay
defeat follows. Fu Ch‛a, king of Wu, had a territory

|               |
|---------------|
| **Examples.** |

of 2,000 *li* and armoured armies of 700,000 men. In the south he warred
with Yüeh and captured him at Ku‛ei Chi. In the north he warred with
Ch‛i and broke his power at Ai Ling. In the west he met with the Duke of
Ts‛in and took him prisoner at Huang Ch‛ih. These successes he won
through the spirit of his people. Afterwards he became inordinately
proud, and gave reins to his lust for women, wealth and territory. He
despised the remonstrances of his ministers and pursued his lawless
pleasure and continued in his evil ways. It was impossible to correct
his habits by good advice. The great minsters hated and resented him and
the soldiers refused him obedience. The king of Yüeh picked 3,000 troops
and took him prisoner in Kan Sui. He captured him through his vanity and
want of solidity. Now the spirit of man has its times of strength and
weakness just as light must give way, at times, to darkness. Thus the
conquering soldiers do not always possess strength, and defeated
soldiers are not always weak. The right plan is to be able to give the
strength of unity to the spirit of the people in order to meet the want
of harmony in the enemy's camp. The incompetent man disunites the spirit
of unity in his people, and meets the united spirit of others with
divided strength. Hence the spirit of solidarity or the reverse are two
elements highly considered in military affairs. When any country faces
danger the king calls his commander to the palace

|                     |
|---------------------|
| **In case of war.** |

and instructs him, saying: "The life of our home-land is in the hands of
you as commander of the army, and in the trouble now facing it, I beg
you; my General, to face the danger." The commander received the
commands. The emperor then orders <span id="page_217">p. 217</span> the
minister of worship and the diviner, first having observed three days of
ceremonial cleansing, to go to the ancestral temple and test the mystic
tortoise, and cast a horoscope for the auspicious day for giving out the
drum and the flags of war. The king enters the temple gate and stands
facing west. The commander enters the temple, and proceeding with arms
akimbo (a sign of respect) to a place below the hall, stands facing
north. The king takes the great hammer<span
id="fr_31"></span>[{31}](tgln1.htm#7_note_31) and holds it by the head
and gives the handle to the commander saying: "From henceforth, the
commander of our armies controls all, even up to Heaven above," again
taking the smaller hammer by the head he gives the handle to the
commander saying, "All below, even to all the seas, is under the control
of the commander of our armies." And the commander having received both
hammers replies, saying, "The kingdom in its politics is not to be
ordered from outside. i.e. by the army: the army will not be directed
from the palace. There can be no divided heart in the service of the
king, nor can there be any hesitation in dealing with the enemy. I, the
commander, having received control as herein expressed, and I, having
received the authority of the drums, the hammers, will not seek
instructions again. May the king no more give any word of instruction to
me. If the king does not agree to this compact I will not dare to
act.<span id="fr_32"></span>[32](tgln1.htm#7_note_32) If the king
agrees, then I bid goodbye and go to pare my nails,<span
id="fr_33"></span>[33](tgln1.htm#7_note_33) and prepare my shroud. I go
out by the dread door."<span id="fr_34"></span>[34](tgln1.htm#7_note_34)
Mounting the commander's chariot and loading the drum, flags, with the
two hammers, he departs, weighted with great responsibility. When the
commander gets near the enemy, he engages in battle, regardless of
death. There is no divided mind; he fights unconscious of heaven above,
of earth below, of enemy in front or king behind; he presses forward,
thinking not of glory or of guilt, should there be retreat. His thought
is centred only on the battle. That the people be protected, and the
king magnified, are his only thoughts. This is what is important to the
kingdom that the principles of the high commanders <span
id="page_218">p. 218</span> be such as these.

   These things being so, the wise will take thought of them: the brave
will fight for their country. Spirit will be

|              |
|--------------|
| **Victory.** |

ardent and high as the clouds, swift like the racing horse, Wu. In this
way, even before battle is joined, the enemy will be filled with dread.
If victory is won and the enemy put to flight, the end is attained.
There will follow the distribution of honours and largesse. Officers
will be advanced in position. Officials will get titles and emoluments.

   Areas will be apportioned for stations of the troops before they
return to their country: the conduct

|                   |
|-------------------|
| **Dispositions.** |

of the soldiers will be decided within the army and the guilty executed.
When it returns to the country, the commander will furl his flags to
enter the gate, and surrender the hammer and the halberd and inform the
prince of the end of the war, saying, "The army has no control after
this. I go to put on calico garments and into retirement,<span
id="fr_35"></span>[35](tgln1.htm#7_note_35) please define my guilt." The
prince will say: "Forgiveness is granted. Go and put on silk clothes."
After a great victory, the commander returns home after a residence of
three years in the palace, two years residence after a moderate victory,
and one year for an inconsequential victory,

   The Country against whom the army is sent is necessarily a lawless
one and the possibility of a victorious campaign is promising because
the war is not one of revenge. Results: Territory taken from the enemy
shall not be given back: the people shall not have any pestilence: the
commander will not have an untimely death: the crops will be luxuriant:
the wind and rains will fall seasonably. A victory in foreign parts will
ensure great prosperity at home. And so renown is secure and there will
be no excess of calamity afterwards.<span
