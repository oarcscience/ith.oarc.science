<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the lst Essay in the series. The Chinese title is Yuan Tao Hsun, (###). The <B>Tao</B> is discussed in a separate article. It needs here only to say that an innovation has been made in the translation of the word Tao by <B>Cosmic Spirit.</B> To anticipate perfectly just criticism to which the translation is open that there is a lack of consistency in the use, it is well to say that Cosmic Spirit is sometimes used, and sometimes the transliterated sound Tao is used. This is a compromise. The Cosmic Spirit really indicates and expresses comprehensively the idea of the Tao in Chinese. The Chinese word is retained because it is being adopted into English partly; and in many cases it is a simpler form for use.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_1"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_1">1</A>. Fu tao cho ###. The ch&ocirc; follows the theme indicating the matter discussed. It also implies personality, but not so here.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_2"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_2">2</A>. <B>Yin</B> and <B>Yang.</B> The negative and positive principles conceived of as existing in nature universally: male and female: light and darkness.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_3"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_3">3</A>. There are no surprising calamities, because all is natural and well-ordered. It may refer more to ill-starred signs than actual physical disturbance.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_4"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_4">4</A>. The rainbow is a bad sign: no one dares to point the finger at it.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_5"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_5">5</A>. The introduction of such persons here and elsewhere with the exaggerated description of their powers may have contributed to the Taoist degeneration of later days. If such passages were introduced by the original writer, it was done to denote the great power of the Tao, in rhetorical terms.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_6"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_6">6</A>. The Creator, i.e., the Tao. There may be here a personification of natural forces under the sway of the Tao.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_7"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_7">7</A>. <B>Central organ.</B> The authority of the mind under the sway of the Tao.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_8"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_8">8</A>. <B>No fatigue,</B> etc: One of the great themes of the work is that there is no diminution of powers, where the Tao is the dominant force. But a reliance on the senses leads to early exhaustion. This is a fundamental teaching.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_9"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_9">9</A>. <B>Legal interference.</B> One of the Liberal principles is that the State should interfere as little as possible by legal enactments. Things have a power of settling themselves without the meddling of opportunist policies and cleverness of the politician.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_10"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_10">10</A>. <B>Quiescent.</B> One of the great words of the ancient Taoist philosophers. It implies a perfect equilibrium in human nature, when undisturbed by the entrance of the disturbing forces of passion, desire and all the inventions of the tinkers that crowd the human stage, people who have invented many methods to aid virtue,&#8212;the <B>te</B> that results from tao. This refers to the Confucianist theories of <B>jen,</B> love, and <B>i,</B> justice. It should be remembered that there was a great controversy between the Taoist and the Confucianist on the origin of being and on the doctrine of human nature.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_11"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_11">11</A>. Do not change the tao-nature for the human, not the spiritual for the sensual.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_12"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_12">12</A>. Cp: Mencius Book vi. I: 8, 4.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_13"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_13">13</A>. Tan Ho. For <B>Tan</B> read <B>chan.</B> A famous angler.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_14"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_14">14</A>. For Yuan Huan read Ch&uuml;an Huan.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_15"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_15">15</A>. For Wu Nao read Hu Hao. The story of how the branches of the mulberry tree came to be used for the most famous bow is that the crows used to rest in the branches. But when springing off, there was such reaction in the branch that the crows got frightened and refused to fly away and so cried in the tree. Another story is that when Huang Ti was flying away to be a genii from the people who loved him, that they shot at the dragon on which he was flying to bring him back, but missed the object; and so the people wailed and the bow came to be known as the "crying bow."</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_16"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_16">16</A>. For Seng Meng Tzu read <B>Peng Meng Tzu.</B></P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_17"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_17">17</A>. The original is rather difficult to render; but the idea is "Be guided by great principles and not by temporary policies."</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_18"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_18">18</A>. <B>T&#8219;u Shan.</B> There are 4 places of this name. The one in the text was in Anhui, 8 li S. E. of Huai Yuan. There was a hill, river and place of the same name. The concord is that between the great Y&uuml; and Feudal Lords.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_19"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_19">19</A>. Yin I. A famous Prime Minister of T&#8219;ang who kept his emperor prisoner until <B>he amended</B> his ways.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_20"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_20">20</A>. <B>Li Chu.</B> A minister of Huang Ti. (2698 B.C.), noted for keenness of eyesight. Mencius mentions him in Book IV Li Lou, Pt. 1. Chap. 1.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_21"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_21">21</A>. Shih Kuang. Great musician. He blinded his eyes for concentration on music.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_22"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_22">22</A>. A small domain, lit: a terrain of 3 li.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_23"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_23">23</A>. Another slap at the Confucian 'sage'. Here the writer touches on a vital Taoist view. It is something akin to the modern view partly expounded by Tolstoy. When men are properly self-governing and taught by the inward monitor, there is no

<A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A>

need for the enactment of law or for human government. This is implied in the common saying "The law is only for bad men." The underlying idea is of a natural scheme of life contrary to the Confucian theory of life which is entirely artificial. Weight and measure. The yard and foot-rule came into existence after the loss of the natural state, through strife and cunning and ambition and greed. These standards gave an occasion for dishonesty and injustice. The doctrine of <B>jen, i,</B> benevolence and justice are an artificial creation which has led the world away from the fundamental truths of life and principles of action. Old Mause in "Old Mortality" gives vent to the idea when he says:&#8212;"Your leddyship and the steward has been pleased to propose that my son Cuddie suld work in the barn wi a new-fangled machine for dighting the corn frae th' chaff, thus impiously thwarting the will o' Divine Providence by raising wind for your leddyship's ain particular use by human art, instead of soliciting it by prayer."</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_24"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_24">24</A>. These items are mentioned, in detail, to show the adaptations of nature and to emphasise its naturalness.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_25"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_25">25</A>. <B>Wu wei.</B> Lit., <B>No action, not doing.</B> This, of course, is not correct. <B>Wu</B> has not its usual meaning of <B>not;</B> but of invisible existence. <B>Yu Wu</B> comes from <B>Wu yu;</B> the existent comes from the non-existent. It is the invisible state from which all visible things come. Thus it is a synonym of Tao. Hence <B>wu wei</B> means <B>tao</B> action. The same idea is seen in the words of thc Psalm. "There is no voice nor sound: their language is not heard."</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_26"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_26">26</A>. The gate of Heaven. This is explained by the next paragraph.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_27"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_27">27</A>. Cosmic Soul. The original is Tao. Tao has been translated by many words, such as Nature, First Cause, Primum mobile, etc.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_28"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_28">28</A>. Kung Kung. One of the two ancient engineers. {Kung Kung is also the mythological figure who knocked down one of the four mountains supporting the heavens, thus accounting for the apparent tilt of the sky.}</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_29"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_29">29</A>. I, king of Kuang Tung mentioned in other essays too. He is the subject of one of the most popular plays in the country.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_30"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_30">30</A>. <B>Sage</B> here refers to Confucius himself. His systems of ethics are man-made moralities and not emanating from the Tao. Hence the contention.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_31"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_31">31</A>. Naturalness is sure in its ways. There may be a veiled attack on ambitious politicians and statesmen who force the course of things. <B>Giddy height</B> Cp. Richard III. "Who raised me to this giddy height."</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_32"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_32">32</A>. <B>Wu wei,</B> Translate by no-action, for antithesis.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_33"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_33">33</A>. Affairs settle themselves. Time is a healer.</P>

and when to close up flowering etc.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_34"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_34">34</A>. The passage is obscure; but the general meaning is there can be no wrenching of the natural.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_35"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_35">35</A>. <B>Symbols of unworthiness.</B> Princes, dukes, lords use depreciatory terms in speaking of themselves, such as <B>orphans,</B> the <B>lonely one</B> and so on.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_36"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_36">36</A>. The Unity. May not mean Tao here, but rather to have a commanding control, mental or physical of any situation or thing.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_37"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_37">37</A>. Just as one general governs the army.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_38"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_38">38</A>. Mainstay. The word is ### i.e. the trunk of a tree.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_39"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_39">39</A>. Pioneers. May there be a reference to ambitious persons?</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_40"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_40">40</A>. Ch&#8219;&uuml; Pei-y&uuml;. A minister of Wei.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_41"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_41">41</A>. The meaning is according to the official commentator, "The Taoist discusses affairs from the <B>tao</B> point of view, and hence is certain in judgment. The <B>tao</B> is before the advent of any affair and so can control it. It also governs the end and issue.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_42"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_42">42</A>. A critical business. Any situation fraught with tense issues.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_43"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_43">43</A>. <B>Sage.</B> The Taoist sage.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_44"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_44">44</A>. Y&uuml;,&#8212;the great emperor.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_45"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_45">45</A>. This passage throws some light on <B>wu wei,</B> viz. that it does not mean laissez faire. He strove: he is prompt in every act: instantaneous to the call of duty.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_46"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_46">46</A>. Cp: Book of History. Bk II. Chap. 2. Sect. 14.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_47"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_47">47</A>. <B>Gain repose.</B> Not ease and leisure, but the freedom from sense agitation aroused by any anti-tao state.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_48"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_48">48</A>. Distance. The word is <B>Hsiu</B> ### which usually means salary, but here length of time or distance.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_49"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_49">49</A>. The action of <B>wu wei.</B> The reference is to the <B>Tao Te Ching</B> Chap. 43. This is a magificent description of water and its power. It worthily shows the exhaustless and beneficial operations of <B>tao.</B></P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_50"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_50">50</A>. Light bears a nearer relation to the Formless Spirit than water does, because it has no substance. Water is the grandson, because it has form and substance.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_51"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_51">51</A>. The passage of anything from the immaterial to the material means deterioration. Plato says "Generation leads to corruption". In Christian theology there is the question of the sinfulness of the flesh. The view is also in Buddhism.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_52"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_52">52</A>. <B>The Supremacy power.</B> The stability given by an inward repose arising from identification with <B>tao.</B> There are no accretions from the flesh.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_53"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_53">53</A>, <A NAME="1_note_54"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_54">54</A>. <B>Immaterial, Formless.</B> Great terms in Taoism. The political conditions of the time is ever hovering over the thought of the writer. He was himself in difficult positions. Indirectly

he may be referring to the emperor, his grandfather, and implying that were he living in fellowship with <B>tao,</B> there would be freedom from the complexities of passion and he would have at his service all the powers of the spirit and nature.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_55"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_55">55</A>. Unity. A commentator says unity is the foundation of the Tao.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_56"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_56">56</A>. It is difficult to say whether he intends to attribute personality to the Unity. It is evident he would give it a separate existence from all else. But as Martineau says, "It is certain that in ancient philosophy words expressive of mental life and action were employed where no proper idea of personality was present." "Types of Ethical Theory," Vol. I. p. 87.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_57"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_57">57</A>. Includes the centre and circumference of the universe.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_58"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_58">58</A>. No circle etc. It can't be measured nor fathomed.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_59"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_59">59</A>. Unity opens the entrance or is the gate of Tao. The idea is the entrance through narrow defile to empire.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_60"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_60">60</A>. Five tones. Kung, shang, ch&uuml;eh, chi (cheng), yu.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_61"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_61">61</A>. Sweet, acid, saline, acrid, bitter.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_62"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_62">62</A>. The unity here may mean the point of transition from the immaterial into the material and vice versa. <B>Unity covers</B> the deep, i.e., everywhere. The point when the invisible passes into the visible, and is all pervasive.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_63"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_63">63</A>. Cp., Cowper's lines,</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_64"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_64">64</A>. Lao Tan referring to the everlasting, natural <B>tao,</B> said ### but <B>tao</B> is used only conventionally for the nameless. It is not easy to give a name to it. <B>One portal.</B> The portal of generation of matter: passing from the invisible to the visible, from spirit to matter, so entering corruption.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_65"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_65">65</A>. Follows law. All is law. The invisible law of the nature of things. In tune with this there can be no erratic ways.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_66"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_66">66</A>. Corruption of tao. Joy and anger are excesses of the equanimity of the <B>tao.</B></P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_67"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_67">67</A>. <B>Repose, purity.</B> Great names in the system, <B>Ching, hs&uuml;.</B></P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_68"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_68">68</A>. Shen Ming, Spiritual and Spirit.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_69"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_69">69</A>. <B>Autocrat of the Universe.</B> Triumphant confidence in the <B>tao.</B></P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_70"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_70">70</A>. <B>He returns within.</B> The <B>tao</B> is within and without. Cp. this with the idea of Plato.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are we sharers in that divine Reason which informs and organises the universe? We must recognise and welcome it everywhere, and follow it out as it ramifies through the world of sense. There is nothing inconsistent in this double view, which regards the material system, now as the opaque veil to hide, and now as the transparent medium to reveal, the inner thought which is the divine essence of all: and seeks at one

time to ascend into the intellectual glory by escape from detaining appearances: at another, to descend with that glory as it streams into the remotest recesses of the phenomenal world." Martineau. "Types of Ethical Theory," Vol. I. p. 67.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_71"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_71">71</A>. This passage seems to imply that if the seeker knocks, he will find. The Tao will respond to human pressure: in other words, prayer is effective. Also it implies the personality of the Tao. The words used are Hsuan fu, ### the hidden secret and profundity.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_85"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_85">85</A>. With this compare what Mencius says, BK VII. 4. 1.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_85a"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_85a">85a</A>. That is when external impressions are eliminated.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_86"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_86">86</A>. Pp. 24-28 may have some spurious sentences as a later addition. It does not seem probable that the same writer wrote all.</P>

<P><A NAME="1_note_87"></A><A HREF="tgl1.htm#fr_87">87</A>. This has been said before in the essay. The recipient is governed by the <B>tao</B> within, which no outward circumstance can change.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>This is the 2nd essay in the Chinese text. The exordium is difficult. As a supplementary explanation and analysis is given later, it is not necessary to say more here, than that the author tries to describe the various steps in the evolution of the cosmos. As a rule, Confucianism is satisfied with describing material phenomena and so starts with Heaven. The Taoists go further back and think of Naturalness and Tao.</I></P>

<P><A NAME="2_note_1"></A><A HREF="tgl2.htm#fr_1">1</A>. The author tries to see and to describe not only the phenomena of the cosmos but also what is beyond&#8212;the various steps in the eternities of time and space. He pushes the thought back to that which is behind all phenomena. Heaven is the ultimate of the Confucian School; but to the Taoist philosopher there is the tao and naturalism.</P>

<P><A NAME="2_note_2"></A><A HREF="tgl2.htm#fr_2">2</A>. <B>Ultimate depths.</B> These are in the beginnings and shrouded in profound mystery.</P>

<P><A NAME="2_note_5"></A><A HREF="tgl2.htm#fr_5">5</A>. The illustration of a man moving a mountain in the night is a common proverb implying something sudden and miraculous. The use of it here is to show the inadequacy of a man-made doctrine divorced from the <B>tao.</B> So Confucianism and Meiism may disappear and lose their sway, because they are not

<P><A NAME="2_note_7"></A><A HREF="tgl2.htm#fr_7">7</A>. The world is a mystery and all events a riddle beyond human solution. For man himself is a part of created things. The Taoist insists that there is a purpose in the cosmos, but only known to the Unknown One.</P>

<P><A NAME="2_note_8"></A><A HREF="tgl2.htm#fr_8">8</A>. The Taoists hold that the <B>tao-man</B> has no <B>kuei</B> (ghost) after death. He may have a <B>shen,</B> spirit.</P>

<P><A NAME="2_note_9"></A><A HREF="tgl2.htm#fr_9">9</A>. The Taoists preserve their bodies and spirits well, so end their lives naturally; and the personality of the spirit enters and is lost in the Cosmic Spirit. They leave no ghost. But those who die prematurely and unnaturally leave a ghost.</P>

<P><A NAME="2_note_10"></A><A HREF="tgl2.htm#fr_10">10</A>. As the Taoists let the <B>tao</B> rule the heart, so no worldly desires clamour within. Hence, they have no cares or worry: their thoughts are tranquil and serene in simplicity. So in sleep the mind rests and there are no dreams.</P>

<P><A NAME="2_note_11"></A><A HREF="tgl2.htm#fr_11">11</A>. The Chinese have an account of the Utopian State which is much admired, but more for its style of writing rather than for the nature of the state.</P>

<P><A NAME="2_note_12"></A><A HREF="tgl2.htm#fr_12">12</A>. The Confucian moralities, benevolence, justice, <B>jen, i,</B> etc., are artificial because not connected with the real source of all things (tao). They were false standards and confuse human nature.</P>

So to understand his attitude we must recall the political conditions of the times. His narrative is a veiled attack on the rulers of the age. He wrote soon after the death of Ch&#8219;in Shih Huang who had stirred the time most impressively. But in many respects his rule was destructive. It had been disturbing and inquisitive. The era was such. So he veiled his attack in honeyed words descriptive of a state of society the very opposite of that of the time-arrogant authority.</P>

throne of Ch&#8219;in when 13 years old. He fought the States still loyal to the House of Chou. In B.C. 221 he was master of the whole of China, from Chihli to Chinkiang and from Hunan to the Eastern Sea. He made a clean slate of China's past history and began as First Emperor with the understanding that his successors would be Second, Third and so on. Everything was to begin from his reign, literature and everything: so he burnt the books. He built the the famous mansion which could seat 10,000 people. He made coinage. He died in Chihli and had a famous grave: the workmen who have made the passages were buried within, so that no one would know the internal labyrinth. In spite of such precaution and power, his dynasty only lasted about 45 years. This is one of the great proofs used that militarism is not the true system of government.

<I>that the Chinese have been a most conservative race; and, in a sense, that is generally true. But we must also remember that they have had a broad outlook on things. For example, in this Essay, there are very illuminating passages showing that the writer was most liberal in his thought and not obstinately conservative in his attitude towards government and Society. It is shown that change was welcomed and often necessary. There are the fundamental principles of right and morality on which no change can be permitted: but, in other respects, change is a healthy and welcome symptom. Alteration in practices may be incumbent, for the sake of the times, and so on:</I></P>
