|  6\. | A survey of the invisible and profound changes that happen will reveal original causes which are indicative of the Tao.                                                         |

| 10\. | Names savour of locality, and each folklore has a nature of its own. To reduce all to a common denomination, for unification, must be done by a unification of the heart first. |
| 11\. | The nomenclature of things throw some light on their origin. In investigating these we are seeking for the truth.                                                               |

| 17\. | The Tao is the origin of the myriad things; their unity is like to the congregation of the trees of the forest.                                                                 |
