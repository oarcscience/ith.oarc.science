<P ALIGN="center"><BIG>A COMPARISON.</BIG></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may compare the Taoist view of life in one respect with that of Socrates. Socrates maintained that he was at his best when his daimonion was working, and his thought clearest when he was most sure of divine guidance. Prof. Bury says that "Socrates represents his own life-work as a sort of religious quest: he feels convinced that in devoting himself to philosophic discussion he had done the bidding of a superhuman guide and he goes to death rather than be untrue to his personal conviction. Because of this he became the champion of free discussion and the supremacy of the individual conscience over human law." And we have the Taoist view that human enactments and the wisdom of Sages may be abolished. Tradition binds man and therefore is inferior to "conscience". If men followed the Tao they would never be opportunists, but always act according to principle and right. Both had unbounded faith in spiritual law. Mere human knowledge is of itself wholly inadequate and uncertain. But the Tao is always full to those who have the mind for it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The title is "Tao Ying (###)" Tao, the Cosmic spirit. There is the idea of 'hovering over,' 'moving on the face' of all things, and all, in acting, give an automatic response to the tao.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The mystery of existence.</I>&#8212;Great Purity asked Exhaustless<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> whether he knew anything of the Tao. Exhaustless replied he knew nothing. He also asked <I>Wu-wei</I>,<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> who replied he had some knowledge. "And is the knowledge you have of it finite?" "Yes, it is finite," <I>Wu-wei</I> replied. "Well, then, how much do you know about the Tao?" "I know that such things as yieldingness, firmness, courtesy and severity, the negative and positive, the recondite and clear are possible through the Tao. Thus it is possible for the Tao to enwrap Heaven and Earth, and to operate with perfect response through the whole universe. This is the limit of my knowledge."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great-Purity also asked Without-Beginning,<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_3"><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></A> saying: "Formerly I asked Exhaustless about the Tao, who replied he had no knowledge; and subsequently I asked <I>Wu-wei</I> who replied that he had knowledge. We have thus the knowledge of <I>Wu-wei</I> and the non-knowledge of Exhaustless. Which of them is right and which is wrong?" Without-Beginning replied, "The non-knowledge of Exhaustless is the more profound; knowledge is superficial; non-knowledge knows the intrinsic, but knowledge only the extrinsic; non-knowledge sees the essence, knowledge the accident." Great-Purity was surprised, and, sighing, replied;

"Thus, then, is non-knowledge the same as knowledge? And is not-knowing the same as knowing? There is no difference, who but knows that knowledge is non-knowledge and non-knowledge is (really) knowledge. Isn't that so?" Without-Beginning replied, "The Tao cannot be heard; the Tao that can be heard is not the Tao. The Tao cannot be seen; that which can be seen is not the Tao. The Tao cannot be spoken; were it possible to express it, then it would not be the Tao. Who is it that can understanding the form of the formless?"

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>A case of conscience. Silence is golden.</I>&#8212;Duke Pei asked Confucius "May men use dark hints or an obscure and subtle way of speech?" Confucius made no response. Duke Pei<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_5"><FONT SIZE=1>5</FONT></A> said, "What about a stone thrown into the water?" Confucius replied, "The expert swimmers of Wu and Y&uuml;eh would get to the bottom and feel it." He again enquired: "What about the effect of throwing water into water? No trace of one, as distinct from the other, would be found. Confucius replied, "The two waters Chih and Sheng of Ch&#8219;i, though mixed, would be detected as to the tastes of each by such as I Shen." Duke Pei then said, "Such being the case, men certainly cannot use occult language." To which Confucius replied, "Why say it cannot be done?" Who knows the sense of words that are spoken? He who knows what words signify does not express (his thought) in words."<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_6"><FONT SIZE=1>6</FONT></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A fisherman must enter the deep water to catch his fish; a hunter must brave danger and enter the lair to get his prey. This is inevitable and not a mere matter of pleasure. Hence the most perfect language<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_7"><FONT SIZE=1>7</FONT></A> does away with words, and the perfect action consists in <I>Wu-wei</I>.

dispute, is shallow and fails to go to the root."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke Pei failed to adopt this advice (of Confucius) and died at Yu Shih. Lao Tz&ucirc; says: (Chap. 73.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Theoretical laws are useless.</I>&#8212;Hui Tz&ucirc; created a system of laws for King Hui for governing the kingdom. When completed, these were shown to all the scholars, who, without exception, praised them. They were then presented to King Hui, who was very pleased with them and showed them to Ts&ecirc; Chien, who said they were good. King Hui said, "Since they are good they should be put into operation." But on Chai Ts&ecirc; Chien objecting to the suggestion, the King wanted to know his reason. Ts&ecirc; Chien replied that when men carried a heavy log of wood, they ha'd and ho'd, those behind responding to those before. This is the song they have for stimulus in carrying heavy loads. They do not use the more classic songs of Cheng and Wei with their high plaintive notes, simply because such are not so fitting to the work. The rites for governing a country do not consist of written enactments. Too much law is not good. This is as Lao Tzu says: (Chap. 57.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The art of education is to teach, "How to see."</I><A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_9"><FONT SIZE=1>9</FONT></A>&#8212;T&#8219;ien Pien was expounding certain principles of the Tao to the King of Ch&#8219;i, and the King, in the conversation, said, "What I am faced with are the practical policies of the Kingdom of Ch&#8219;i; these principles of yours are useless as means to abolish the distresses of the land. I want to hear something definite and practical on the art of government." T&#8219;ien P&#8219;ien replied that though his words contained nothing on government, yet they could be made to apply. And he gave this illustration. "A forest is composed of raw timber; it has no ready-made material. Wood must be

<A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A>

dressed accordingly to suit the need. Would the king kindly examine the principles he had stated and adopt them to the needs of the government of Ch&#8219;i. The King would find them adaptable. Though they may not abolish the embarrassments of the country, yet this is the Tao that moves Heaven and changes the world in the evolutionary flux. The affairs of Ch&#8219;i are small in comparison." This episode exemplifies Lao Tan's statement: (Chap. 14.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King wanted practical advice on the administration of Ch&#8219;i, and T&#8219;ien P&#8219;ien gave him general principles. Now the actual manufactured article is of less importance than the trees of the forest, since the one depends on the other. The forest is nothing without rain; rain is nothing without the operations of Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang are nothing without the essential co-operating harmony; harmony is nothing without the Tao.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>A word of advice to the avaricious profiteer. True self-interest.</I>&#8212;When Sheng, the Duke of Pei, gained the kingdom of Ching, and on his failing to distribute the contents of the Treasury between the people, members of his party, after the lapse of seven days, came in and told him, "If what is gained illicitly is not distributed to the public, distress is sure to come. It is better to burn the treasures, if they cannot be distributed amongst the people, so that disaster may not befall us." Duke Pei would not listen to the advice. In nine days Duke Sh&ecirc; attacked the place, and having gained entrance, distributed the goods in the treasury amongst the multitude: he also issued the munitions of war, in the Treasury, to the people. In consequence of this he captured Duke Pei after investing his palace for nineteen days. The Kingdom didn't really belong to Pei and his desire for it may be said to be a piece of avarice. That he failed to act generously towards the people, and serve his own true self-interest thereby, showed that he was most stupid as well as avaricious. The

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Character is the essential thing in a ruler. Hereditary power is useless.</I>&#8212;Chao Chien Tz&ucirc; adopted Hsiang Tz&#365; as his heir. Tung Ngo Yu objected on the grounds of Wu Hs&uuml;'s (Hsiang Tz&#365;) obscurity, holding he was not fit to be a successor. Chien Tz&#365; replied, "that his character was such as to ensure success. He would bear indignity for the sake of the kingdom."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time after, Chih Pei when drinking with Hsiang Tz&#365; slapped his face. A minister suggested he should be put to death for this, but Hsiang Tz&#365;, the King, argued that the deceased Prince had adopted him because he could bear personal indignity for the throne. "Do you think," he said, "that he put me in this place to slay people?" After the passing of ten months Chih Pei invested Hsiang Tz&#365; at Ching Yang. Hsiang Tz&#365; divided his army and attacked him on either side and routing Chih Pei slew him and made his skull into a drinking vessel. This confirms Lao Tz&#365;'s saying: (Chap. 26.)</P>

origin,"&#8212;but before he had finished this sentence, Yeh Ch&#8219;ueh seemed to have lost interest in what Pei I was saying, so he got up and departed singing this ditty as he was going, "His form and limbs look withered and dried up: his mind looks dead like ashes. Truly I don't know how to deal with such a show of stupidity. I have no mind to talk to him. What kind of a man is he really?" This just confirms Lao Tz&#365;'s saying:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The use of the mailed fist is not the way to maintain the fruits of victory.</I>&#8212;Chao Hsiang Tz&ucirc; attacked Ti and overpowered him and took his two prefectures of Yu Jen and Chung Jen. The messenger came to announce the victory and to offer congratulations, and when Hsiang Tz&ucirc; was about to sup, it was noticed that he was of a sad countenance, which led them to say, "People find it a matter of joy to become possessors of two cities in a morning. So what may be the cause of the present sadness of the Prince?" Hsiang Tz&ucirc; replied to them, "The floods of the two rivers last only three days at most. Storms of winds and rain pass over quickly. There is no accumulated merit in our Chao family; how is it that now, in one morning, two cities have fallen to me? Is not this ominous of disaster?" When Confucius heard of this, he said, "The good fortune of the family of Chao must increase. Dejection, or moderation of spirit, is the foundation of greatness, and hilarity is the root of decay. It isn't victory that is difficult, but the maintenance of the fruits of victory: this is the difficulty. The worthy kings of the past who maintained victory in this spirit, handed down their happiness to their successors. Ch&#8219;i, Ts&#8219;u, Wu, Yueh gained victories in their time, but eventually fell into decay, simply because they failed to apprehend how to maintain victory. This can only be done by making the Tao dominant." Confucius, for example, could manipulate the ponderous gate of the city, but never displayed

his physical strength before man. It is said that Mei-tz&ucirc; (who knew no art of war) maintained the defensive and offensive against Duke Yu P&#8219;an and brought him to submission, but not by military force. They knew that the effective way of maintaining victory was by looking upon gentleness, right not might, as the strong power, just as Lao Tz&ucirc; says: (Chap. 4.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Not Might but Right.</I>&#8212;Hui Meng had an interview with King Sung K&#8219;ang. He wore his characteristic way of restless feet, of humming, and coughing, and speaking with rapidity, during the visit. The King said, "What I admire is the achievements of valour, humanity and justice. Have you, Sir, anything to instruct me?" Hui Meng replied, "Your servant has a Way according to which even the shafts of the valiant will do me no harm, neither can force, however cleverly used, succeed against me. Great Prince have you truly a mind to try it?" The King replied, "Very excellent! It's just what I want to hear about." Hui Meng continued, "But the shaft that will not penetrate me, the attack that will not succeed against me, do not seem, after all, the best. Your servant has still a superior way; such a way that a man with courage will not dare to use force against me: though possessing the power, he will not venture to use it against me. This lack of daring to thrust and attack will not be from want of will. Your servant has a way still higher than this even. This highest form will make men naturally lose the desire to stab and kill for the display of daring and courage. Still simple absence of the intention of using force does not produce a mind of love and care. So I have something still better than even this way, which will give unfailing delight to all men and women. This best way is of more worth than the valour of force: it is superior to these four other ways. Is the Great King the only one not desirous of it?" King Sung responded that he desired

<!------------------------page 109------------------------>

<A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A>

above all things to get this. Hui Meng replied. "This way is really no other than the doctrines of Confucius and Mei. Kung Ch&#8219;iu and Mei Ts&ecirc; were princes, though they had no territory: they were leaders, though without official status. None in the country, be they men or women, but craned their necks and stood on tip-toe that they might find and win the help of their doctrines. You are a great King, ruling a large empire: were you sincerely to have this ambition, every part of your kingdom would benefit; and so you would greatly excel Confucius and Mei.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Sung having nothing to say in reply, Hui Meng departed. The King said to those about him, "What a talker! My guest overcame me thoroughly, when speaking." This way agrees with what Lao Tzu says: (Chap. 23.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The King is the conning man.</I>&#8212;In ancient times, Yao had nine assistants, Shun seven, and Wu Wang had five. Yao, Shun and Wu Wang were not experts in any one thing, like their assistants. They sat in their offices receiving the reports of successful operations. They were, however, masters in their estimate of the abilities of men. Now, a runner can never beat the great horse, <I>Chi</I>, in a race: but when this horse is hitched to a carriage, it is not able to beat a man. In the north is a beast, which goes by the name of <I>Ch&uuml;eh</I>, with front quarters like a rat, and hind quarters like a hare. When it runs, it stumbles (as it has short forelegs and long hindlegs); it falls when it walks. This animal always picks out the fragrant grass for the <I>Chiung Chiung Ch&uuml; Hs&uuml;</I> and supplies it with this grass (another animal with long forelegs and short hindlegs. It can't ascend hills). The <I>Chiung Chiung</I>, therefore, always carries the Ch&uuml;eh on its back, because of the infirmity of its legs.</P>

Confucius told him: "Tz&ucirc;, you have not done quite right. Whenever the sage takes any matter in hand (or acts), he supplies a principle that affects the conventions of life and the manners

of society, with the result that the effects of the teaching would be handed down to succeeding generations. He never acts with a view to his own individual case. The kingdom, at the present time, has but few wealthy people; the majority are poor. To receive the cost of a ransom from the Public Treasury should not be looked on as avaricious: it would be impossible to redeem many under present conditions, if help from the Treasury were not accepted. Under such circumstances, no Luh prisoners in the hands of the Feudal Lords could be ransomed after this." This view of Confucius showed that he was profoundly versed in the true spirit of reform and proper principles of action, which is consonant with Lao Tzu's dictum: (Chap. 52.)</P>

His reply was: "Wu often fought and often conquered," i.e., Wu was too often victorious in war. Wu Hou answered that frequent victories in war should lead to the greatness of a country, and he could not see how this could be the cause of decay. Li K&#8219;&ecirc; replied, "Frequent wars exhaust the people: frequent victories make the masters drunk with pride. The more the pride, the more is the vitality of the people consumed in vainglorious wars. Few are the countries that can stand such a strain and not decay. Pride and arrogance lead to licence and anarchy, exhausting resources and people. Thus, there come hatred and dislike, leading to all sorts of schemes and devices (for amelioration of hardships). The strange thing is that Wu did not succumb much earlier." When it did fall, Fu Ch&#8219;ai (the minister) committed suicide at Kan Sui. Lao Tzu's words give the principle: (Chap. 9.)</P>

official post from Duke Huan of Ch&#8219;i, but he had no means of getting an interview with him. In the meantime he followed the work of a merchant, and was on his way to Ch&#8219;i, driving his cart loaded with goods. Resting one evening outside the city gate, Duke Huan came out to receive a guest for whom the gates were opened. The carts round the gate were ordered to move off. The lamps and lights were many and the retainers were numerous. Ning Y&uuml;eh saw his opportunity and, tapping the horns of his cow, sang a ditty in high clear notes. Duke Huan tapped the arm of his attendant, saying, "How strange! That singer can be no ordinary person. Let him come in the train of the carriages."<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_14"><FONT SIZE=1>14</FONT></A> When Duke Huan had returned home, his attendants waited his instructions regarding the guest. The Duke prepared court robes for him for an interview. Ning Y&uuml;eh talked about how to govern a country at the interview. Duke Huan was delighted and was about to offer him a post, when the entourage remonstrated that the guest was a man of Wei, and that Wei was not far away. The prince had better send a man to enquire about his past record and, if good, he could then be engaged." "Not so," replied the Duke, "if it be found that there are some minor defects against him, we shall lose the excellent services of a man for some slight error of his in the past. This is how governors lose the scholars of the country. You can always judge from what you hear: and, after hearing, there is no need of enquiries into the past. This man is quite agreeable to me. To get just the right men is a difficult matter. Men must be estimated at their best."</P>

Being attacked by the Tartars, he hid tribute of furs, cotton, silk fabrics, precious stones, which, being refused, made him say, "What the Tartars want is land: wealth and goods will not satisfy them." T&#8219;ai Wang Tan Fu<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_17"><FONT SIZE=1>17</FONT></A> reasoned in this way: "To live with the people (elder brothers) and kill their brothers, to mingle with the fathers and slay their sons are acts I will not be a party to; so rest you here in peace. To serve the Tartars will not be different from serving me. Moreover I have heard it said, "Don't hurt the people for the sake of territory." So, taking his staff, he departed. The people clung to him, and they went forth and founded a kingdom near the Ch&#8219;i mountain. The great ancestor Tan Fu may be accredited with knowing how to preserve his kind.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though rich and honourable, he did not injure his person by his mode of life: though poor and lowly, he did not permit the love of gain to entangle his person. As it is now, there are those who would look upon it as a great calamity to lose the titles and emoluments of their ancestors; but they regard it as a light matter to mar the bodies handed down through long ages. Is this not a silly view of life? Listen to what Lao Tzu says: (Chap. 13.)</P>

Chan Ho replied, "Your servant has never heard of any country being in disorder when the person of the ruler is well-governed: nor, on the other hand, have I ever heard that order can be had in a nation where the personal life of the ruler is disordered. So I place the whole responsibility (of government) on the person,&#8212;personal renovation. I would not venture to attribute it to the art of government itself."

If you can justify yourself, well: otherwise you will be put to death." The wheelwright replied, "Of course I can justify myself. Permit your servant to explain himself from his own work of wheelwright. If the wedges are driven in too fast, they will not enter (but break): if driven in too slowly, they will not be firm: neither too slow nor too fast is an art whereby the hand and will wholly act in concert, and in this way perfect workmanship is got. Your servant cannot transmit this expertness to his son, nor can the son get it from him, and so he is still working at wheels, though close on 70 years of age.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>A wily old diplomat.</I>&#8212;In ancient time Han Tz&#365;, the city-engineer, being Prime Minister of Sung, spoke to the King, making the following suggestion: "The peace and unrest of a nation, the government and the anarchy of the people depend on the king's rewards and punishments. Rewarding with titles and the giving of largesse is what the people like. Let the King himself exercise this power. But the death penalty and punishment arouse the disgust of the people. Let your servant, therefore, discharge this function." The King of Sung replied, that it was a good suggestion, since he would get the praise and his minister bear the brunt of opprobrium, and he was sure that the Feudal Lords would not scorn him for this. Nevertheless, continued the King, when the people realized that the autocratic powers of death were in the hands of the minister, the officers would pay him respect and the

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>A discerning wife.</I>&#8212;Chung Erh, the son of the Duke of Tsin, in the course of his wandering life happened to pass through Ts&#8219;ao, the prince of which country showed him no courtesy. However, the wife of Hsi Fu Chi, a minister, said to her husband: "The prince is not very attentive to the son of the Duke of Tsin. I notice that all who accompany him are able men. When they return into power they are certain to come and attack Ts&#8219;ao. Why don't you pay some attention to them?" Hsi Fu Chi, in consequence, presented them with a costly feast and sent a present of jade. Chung Erh took the food but declined the jade. After returning to his country, he organised an expedition against Ts&#8219;ao and gained its submission. He commanded the three regiments not to enter the village of Hsi Fu Chi.

his burial, the magistrate of Chung Mu transferred his allegiance to Ch&#8219;i. Five days after the burial, Hsiang Tz&ucirc; took his troops to the attack of Chung Mu: however, before his soldiers were even posted round the place, 100 feet of the wall fell down, whereupon Hsiang Tz&ucirc; sounded the retreat and withdrew. The commanders remonstrated with the Prince, maintaining that Heaven itself showed its approval of their cause in punishing the crime of Chung Mu, in that it had caused the wall to crumble of itself before them, a sure indication that they should not retire. The prince replied in these words: "I have heard that Hs&uuml; Hsiang used to say: 'The Superior Man doesn't take advantage of an enemy's difficulty nor press him when he is in danger.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Intuitive sagacity.</I>&#8212;Duke Mu of Ts&#8219;in spoke to the horse-expert, Pei Lu, asking him whether his son Tz&ucirc; Hsing, seeing he was old himself, could buy him a good horse. His reply was that a good horse may be judged from its form, stand, muscles and bones: but a super-excellent horse was not to be judged by these outward points. In looking for such a horse, form should be lost sight of; the stand of the horse may be indecisive or need not be particularly good, the texture may be indifferent. A unique horse of this kind would not raise dust in galloping nor leave a trace of its steps behind it. My son's qualities are secondary. He may recognise a good horse, but not the unique one. I have an assistant, however, who helps me in feeding and grooming the horses, who is in no whit inferior to myself: his name is Chiu Fang Yin. Please interview him." The Duke commissioned this person to buy a horse. He returned in three

months with the information that he had got a horse in Shan Ch&#8219;iu. Duke Mu asked him what kind of a horse it was, and he replied that it was a stallion of yellow colour. Men were sent for it, and, when it came, it was found to be a black mare. The Duke called Pei Yoh and said what a mess the man whom he had recommended had made of things. He neither knew the colour of the hair, nor the quality of the animal: neither was he aware of whether it was a stallion or a mare. "What kind of a horse-fancier could such an individual be?" Pei Yoh breathed deeply and heaved a sigh saying: "Is it as bad as that! This man is a thousand times superior to me as a connoisseur of horses. What Yin sees in a horse is its natural endowments and not merely the outward accidents. In seeking its vitality, he doesn't think of the flesh and bone: he looks for the intrinsic merits, without regarding the extrinsic form. He searches for the essentials and has no eyes for the non-essentials. He looks for what he wants to see and pays no attention to what he doesn't want to see. Such points as he observes are above the mere form of the horse." When the horse was led in, it proved to be truly a horse of a thousand <I>li</I>.

empire. Ch&#8219;u Tz&ucirc; responding said: "The ancients governed best by not making any changes in past methods and not altering the usual practices. But since you propose doing so, let me tell you it will not be good. I have also heard that enmity is an inversion of nature: the military is an obnoxious instrument, on which people depend in settling their quarrels. Strife is what men desire to eliminate. You now secretly plan this method of brute force, and delight in the use of this hurtful instrument. If you were to carry on those struggles, you would be acting most banefully. Further, when you employed the Luh troops against Ch&#8219;i, you gained your purpose in spite of a bad cause: in like manner, you conquered Ts&#8219;in in the face of all right. I have heard it said, If you keep from bringing disaster and miseries on men, you will keep yourself from your own ruin. By ruining others, you complete your own ruin. I firmly believe that our country's King has transgressed the laws of Heaven and wrecked human principles often; but no disaster has, hitherto, overtaken him, and it must be that you are the man to bring this on. Ah: wait and see!" Wu Ch&#8219;i became alarmed and asked if there were a possibility of avoiding such a catastrophe. Ch&#8219;u Tz&ucirc; replied that as the catastrophe impending over all had already taken form,<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_22"><FONT SIZE=1>22</FONT></A> it would be impossible to avert it.

King Chuang responded that Tsin did not attack Ts&#8219;u, in the days of former Princes, so it must be that he was personally guilty of something to bring on such shame. All the ministers replied that

<A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A>

Tsin did not attack Ts&#8219;u during the regime of past ministers, so it must be owing to their fault that Tsin came to attack the country now. They begged for an order to meet the attack. The King weeping bitterly, the tears falling down his garments, rose up and made obeisance to all the ministers.</P>

But the Duke objected to this since he carried the work of government and it would be unfortuitous for him to die. "In that case," Tz&#365; Wei said: "It could be shifted on to the people." Again the Duke objected on the plea that if the people were to die, he would have no one over whom to rule, and it would be preferable for him alone to die. "Let it then be transferred on to the Seasons," said Tz&#365; Wei. Once more the Duke expressed his unwillingness to this proposal, since the livelihood of the people depended on the Seasons; for, should the people experience a famine, they would die. "And were I," he continued, "to risk the life of the people to save my own, who would desire to have me as their King! My days are finished; so

there's an end of it. Don't say anything more." Tz&ucirc; Wei turned to the north, making his obeisance, said: "May I venture to congratulate your Majesty? Though Heaven is placed high, it yet hears those below. The Prince has given expression to the thought of a good man in his three objections. So Heaven will surely reward the Prince threefold. To-night this planet will move 21 <I>li</I> and the Duke will have 21 years' lease of life." In response to the question of what assurance there was of this, Tz&#365; Wei replied: "The Prince spoke three times the words of a wise man and the star must remove the distance I indicated. May I ask you to come outside and see? If it doesn't deviate the distance mentioned, you may take my life." The Duke assented. That evening the star did move away 21 <I>li</I>.

Therefore in the use of this skin, it came to be second nature to him, and by this concentrated practice he became perfect. How much more may it be said of that which is in constant use!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Bear present indignity and wait for empire.</I>&#8212;Wen Wang sharpened his virtues and cultivated his government, so that, in three years, two-thirds of the country owned him allegiance. Chou, the emperor, was troubled when he heard it, and said: "I really can't rise early and retire late and mend my ways and cultivate virtue, belabouring my mind and wearing my body with heavy toils! But if I don't do it and let him go and think no more about him, I fear he would attack me." Ts&#8219;un Hou Hu said to him; "Chou Pei Ch&#8219;ang<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_24"><FONT SIZE=1>24</FONT></A> i.e. Wen Wang, is a person of benevolence and justice and of good judgement. His eldest son, Fa, is a man of courage and determination. His second son, Tan, is a person of pious and frugal habits and possesses the gift of reading the drift of the times. But should you try to follow his example, you cannot escape the danger of such a course; if you take no notice of him and let him go free, you are bound to come to a bad end. Even an ugly cap must be worn on the head. So I counsel you to check him before his schemes are matured." Thereupon Ch&#8219;u Shang held Wen Wang captive in Yu Li. Whereupon San I Sheng, having a thousand ingots of silver, sought for the most curious and precious stones in the empire. He obtained a tandem of the tiger-marked horses, 300 pieces of black jade, 500 cowries, the dusky leopard, the yellow <I>p&#8219;i</I>, (bear) the blue kan (wild dog), and 2,000 pieces of the white tiger with

the striped skin. Having collected these, he presented them to Chou by means of an intermediary, the minister Fei Chung. When Chou saw the gifts, he was delighted with them and liberated Wen Wang, killing an ox and offering it to him as a parting gift. On his return home, Wen Wang simulated an infatuation for building doors inlaid with jade and lofty towers, played with girls and spent his time dilly-dallying with drums and music; but really he was waiting his chance to fall on Chou. When Chou heard of these infatuations, it made him say: "Chou Pei Ch&#8219;ang has changed his way and altered his course of life. There will be no more disquiet for me." Chou, however, did not mend his ways, but cast the iron man,<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_25"><FONT SIZE=1>25</FONT></A> he took out the heart of Pei Kan, and ripped out the embryo of a pregnant woman and slew the minister who remonstrated with him.

In response the king wanted to know, further, how these things were to be done. Yen replied, "Act with circumspection as though you were approaching a deep pool or treading on thin ice." In turn, the king said, "Fearful for kings then." Yen said, "Within the whole empire, if the king acts well, the people recognise him as their pastor: if he acts ill, they look on him as an enemy. The servants of Hsia and Shang became the enemies of the kings, Chieh and Chou, and transferred their allegiance to Tang and Wu. The people of Hs&uuml; Hsia attacked their ruler and

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The principles of the Sages should be abolished, as they are the maxims of robbers.</I>&#8212;The followers of Ch&ecirc;, when asking their chief if thieves had any principles, received the reply that it was not possible for them to be without such. The person who could guess where the treasure was stored, was a superior man: the first to enter was the man of courage: the last to leave, was the hero. In the average division of spoils there was an element of justice. The member of the gang who knew when to act was the man of knowledge. Where one of these five factors was lacking no great act of plunder could be successful. Nothing in the world could be done without these principles. From this it may be inferred that the mind of the brigand must needs borrow the teaching of the sages for carrying on his trade. Lao Tz&#365; says: (Chap. 19.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Use for the rough diamonds of Society.</I>&#8212;General Tz&#365; Fa of Ts&#8219;u liked to look out for men of skill. He encouraged everyone who showed any talent. Now there was a clever thief in Ts&#8219;u who heard of this, so he went to see the general, saying that he had heard he was on the look out for men of skill; that his was in thieving, and as he would like to try his skill, he offered himself as a soldier. Hearing this, the general was in such haste to see him that he could hardly wait to put on his hat and robes to receive him civilly. His attendants tried to dissuade him from showing any civility to a thief. The general replied that this was no business of theirs.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Ch&#8219;i marshalled its troops to attack

Ts&#8219;u. Tz&#365; Fa, the commander of the Ts&#8219;u army, was pressed and had to withdraw his forces three times. The best leaders of Ts&#8219;u had exhausted their plans and used every device, but the army of Ch&#8219;i still advanced and was stronger than ever. Just then the quondam thief begged permission of the general to use his little talent. Tz&#365; Fa consented, and without asking any particulars, sent him off. So the thief entered the camp of the Ch&#8219;i commander and stole the curtain of his bed, as he was sleeping, and brought it to his general. The general thereupon sent it back by a messenger with the words that one of his soldiers found the commander's curtains, when gathering fire sticks: so he was returning it to the man in charge, by a messenger. The next day, the thief soldier stole the pillow of the commander, as he was sleeping. This again Tz&#365; Fa returned in the same way. The next day he went and abstracted the commander's hair-fastening. Tz&#365; Fa once more returned the article. When the soldiers became aware of this, they were greatly alarmed, and the commander held a consultation with his officers maintaining that if they didn't immediately return home, it was not impossible that the King of Ts&#8219;u would get the commander's head next! He then withdrew the troops and departed. This is, as the common saying has it, <I>no gift is too little, no ability too slight for the king to use</I>. Just as Lao Tz&#365; says: (Chap. 27.)</P>

another day, on seeing him again, Hui said, "I can sit without being conscious of my body. I have reached the abstraction of the Tao." Confucius suddenly asked, "What do you mean by sitting in a state of abstraction?" Yen Hui replied: "Lose all sense of the physical body: I can be detached from sentiency, and be oblivious of this outward form and abandon knowledge: thus situated I penetrate within the spiritual flux: passivity is what I mean by sitting in a state of insensibility." Chung Ni replied, "Penetration into these implies a state without <I>shan</I>, goodness, virtue: the state of spiritual passivitity or flux implies a state without the constant principles and maxims of the Sages.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>A false move.</I>&#8212;Duke Mu of Ts&#8219;u mobilised his troops for a surprise attack on Cheng. Ch&#8219;ien Hs&uuml; disagreed with the proposal, on the grounds that for a surprise attack to be successful, the chariots must not be over 100 <I>li</I> away, and the infantry not over 30 <I>li</I> from the objective; that the plans must be secret and not divulged; the soldiers' keenness must not have lost its edge (as it would, after long marches); the commissariat must not be depleted: the people must not be exhausted; but all, by uniting their keen spirit and abounding strength in the objective, attack the enemy, and overawe him. "But in the case before us," he said, "the distance is several thousand <I>li</I>: the territories of several Feudal Princes must be crossed to make this surprise attack. Your servant wonders whether the King would not reconsider the plan." But Duke Mu refusing the advice, Ch&#8219;ien Hsu in sending forth the troops wore mourning hemp garments, and wept.</P>

and was met on the east of it by a trader from Cheng Hsuan, Kao by name, who had come, inspired by the command of the Baron of Cheng, to welcome the weary troops of Ts&#8219;in by an offering of 12 oxen. The three commanders were alarmed, and deliberated, saying they had marched several thousand <I>li</I> to a surprise attack on a people, but before they had reached their objective, people were aware of their purpose and so were prepared: the surprise therefore would be impossible. The troops were withdrawn and departed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then Duke Wen of Tsin fell sick and died; but before the burial had taken place, Hsien Chen spoke to the young king, Hsiang Kung, saying: "My former Prince, in days gone by, was friendly with Duke Mu, as is well known to everybody, and none of the Feudal Lords but was aware of it. But here we find that, even ere our dead King is buried, he (Mu) does not offer his condolences nor ask permission to pass over our territory. This is because he sees our King is dead and despises our new King. I beg for authority to attack him." This being granted, Hsien Chen called up the army and, meeting the forces of Ts&#8219;in at Yao, routed them. He captured their three commanders and led them captive. On hearing these tidings, Duke Mu put on sack-cloth and wailed in the temple, as he related the events to the people. Lao Tzu says: (Chap. 71.)</P>

One morning, later,

he enquired of the servitors which of the maids had the beautiful pair and advised the king to make her his consort. (He thus wished to curry favour with the king and the new queen). The king of Ch&#8219;i was most delighted and heaped honours on Duke Hsueh. Thus when the master's desires are revealed to the servant, a handle is given the servant to control the master.

Having crossed through to the limit of the North, he entered the Hsuan Ch&#8219;&uuml;eh mountain and arrived at the top of the Meng Ku range. Here he met with a scholar-like person whose eyes were deep set, his temples were covered with jet black hair, tears stood in his eyes: he had the shoulders of a kite; his head was generous above and receding below. He seemed full of merriment, as he danced in the breezes. He looked at Lu Ao and appeared ill-pleased to see him there: the arms, that were swaying in his gyrations, he let fall and slipped behind a stone column. Lu Ao came forward and looked at him, just as he was seated on a tortoise shell and swallowing oysters. Lu Ao addressed him thus: "I thought I was the only individual who had turned his back on kith and kin to get a thorough observation of the uttermost parts of the world. As a young man I was fond of travel, nor have I changed my habits in old age; so having traversed the four quarters of the earth, I still had the extreme north unvisited. To-day I find you, Sir, here! May it not be possible that we may be friends?" The scholar-like man smilingly replied: "Hsi! you are from China and have chosen to come to this distant spot. But you musn't think this is very far. Here there are still the sun and moon, the stars, too, are hung out here. Here the Yin and Yang still operate, and the four seasons

come and go. These parts compared with the unnameable places are still circumscribed. But where I roam to the south there is the boundless waste; to the north I stop in the profound gloom; to the west there is an illimitable vista; on the east I go beyond the orient. In these distant regions there is no firmament above nor earth below: there is no sound to be heard nor vista on which to gaze; still further on, there is only the sound as of rolling waters. Thither it is I have not been able to reach. Now Sir, having reached this place to which you have voyaged for the first time, you musn't think you have reached the end of the world: as a matter of fact you are far from that. Rest here, Sir: I must go to Han Man.<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_31"><FONT SIZE=1>31</FONT></A> beyond the range of the nine Heavens. I musn't abide here long." This strange man then lifted his arms and pulling together his body, forthwith disappeared in the clouds. Lu Ao, looking after him, saw him not. He stopped his chariot. Feeling annoyed with himself and with the turn things had taken, he said: "Compared with that person I am no more than a yellow heron or a worthless worm of the earth; I can only crawl a few feet in a whole day, whereas he has already sped a long way. Isn't it grievous!" Thus Chuang Tzu says:</P>

doing so? The fisherman replied that Ch&#8219;i Tz&#365; didn't wish people to capture small fishes. That was the reason. Wu returned to Confucius and told him this, remarking that Ch&#8219;i Tz&#365;'s virtue was perfect, in that he had induced men to act in their privacy as though a monitor stood by their side with the warning and admonitions of severe punishment.

All the passengers were saved, and the wind and waves died away. Tz&#8219;u Fei was made a Baron of Ching, with territory. Confucius, hearing of it, remarked, "Tz&#8219;u Fei did well in drawing his sword at the hideous monsters of the river." Thus Lao Tz&ucirc; says: (Chap. 75.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The man of fickle purpose is unfit to be a leader.</I>&#8212;Shun Yu K&#8219;un of Ch&#8219;i counselled King Wu to adopt the principle of Federation. The King accepted the advice and gave him ten fine chariots to go to Ching. When about to depart, his men held that federation was not good enough; so he offered the King the further advice of

Imperialism.<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_43"><FONT SIZE=1>43</FONT></A> Just as he was departing with this alternative idea, the King stopped him, as he had lost confidence in a man who had as suddenly abandoned the purpose of federation, holding such a person incompetent to work out the principle of imperialism, as he was unstable. Words should be based on conviction, and business should be carried forward on fundamental principles. When these are both lost, devices, though many, are useless. This is the significance of the figure biting his finger cast on the Chou tripod.<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_44"><FONT SIZE=1>44</FONT></A> It showed the mind of the ancient kings how they did not care to use forced cleverness. Hence Sheng Tz&ucirc; says, "A carpenter knows how to make a door. If he only made one to open and not to shut, he would not know the intention and raison d'&ecirc;tre of a door."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Personality must not be hampered.</I>&#8212;Tien Chiu of the sect of Mei Tz&ucirc; followed the master's method. Desiring to see King Hui of Ch&#8219;ing, he hung up the reins of his fine carriage, vainly waiting audience. He remained a whole year at the court without getting an interview. Some one advised him to go and see the King of Ts&#8219;u. This king received him gladly and gave him credentials to go as minister to Ch&#8219;ing. On arriving, King Hui finding that he was duly accredited with a general's commission, received him willingly and gave him an audience. In leaving the palace, he sighed deeply, saying to those around him: "I stayed for three years at Ch&#8219;ing without an audience; never did I imagine I could get one vi&acirc; Ts&#8219;u." In business matters it may be said: "The near is distant, and the distant is near." Hence the ways of the great man may not be gauged by any routine formula. He arrives at his object in his own way, and that is all about it, as Kuan Tzu remarks: "An owl will not get to its destination if its wings are tied."</P>

He replied that it would be Chih of the centre army: "because," he said, "this man in administering, carried on his examination with harshness; he informed himself of vexatious details; he regarded loyalty to consist in being stingy to his underlings and reckoned that merit lay in gaining many good marks from the government. Such a person may be likened to one stretching leather. Pull it, and it can be made larger. Nevertheless, this is the way to tear it. Lao Tz&ucirc; says:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Strict justice and loyalty.</I>&#8212;The Duke of Ching asked T&#8219;ai P&#8219;u what was the effect of his teaching? And the reply was: "It can shake the Earth." An Tz&ucirc;, the Prime Minister, went to interview the duke, and the duke said to him, "T&#8219;ai P&#8219;u told me his ability could shake the Earth. Now how can he shake the Earth?" An Tz&ucirc; was silent and made no reply. He went out and spoke to T&#8219;ai P&#8219;u saying, "I saw formerly the planet Kou in the region of Fang Hsin (###). Did it shake the earth?" T&#8219;ai P&#8219;u replied, "Naturally it did." An Tz&ucirc; withdrew and T&#8219;ai P&#8219;u went to the Duke, saying he didn't mean to say that he could shake earth, but that the earth was about to shake from natural causes. Tien Tz&ucirc; Yang, hearing this, said, "The perplexing silence of An Tz&ucirc; arose from his desire to shield T&#8219;ai P&#8219;u from death." His interview with T&#8219;ai P&#8219;u showed his desire to know the truth, fearing lest the king should have deceived him in what he had said. It may be truly said that An Tz&ucirc; acted loyally to

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>A mistaken judgement.</I>&#8212;Viscount Wei Wen, at a feast he gave to his ministers at Yang Ch&#8219;&uuml; (Tai Yuan), being somewhat under the influence of liquor, sighed deeply, as he said: "I alone have no minister like to Yu Jang." For loyalty Ch&#8219;un Chung poured out a large cupful of liquor and held it up to the king saying: "May it please you to drink up this 'as a fine.'" "Why so," replied the king. "Your servant has heard it said, that the carrying out of the requests of parents is not thought of as filial piety. A just prince does not think of the loyalty of ministers who carry out their duties." Now what kind of man was Yu Jang's king? He was a defeated prince. Viscount Wen drank the cup at one gulp, saying: "The deed of Yu Jang arose from the lack of loyal ministers of the type of Kuan Chung and Pao Hs&uuml;." Loyalty is seen in times of anarchy. Hence Lao Tz&ucirc; says: (Chap. 18.)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Do not be puffed up by knowledge.</I>&#8212;When Confucius was viewing the fane of Duke Huan, in which was a vessel called Yu Chih,<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="tgln1.htm#5_note_46"><FONT SIZE=1>{46}</FONT></A>&#8212;or the leaning tube,&#8212;he exclaimed: "How splendid that we have seen this vessel!" Turning to his disciples, he said, "Boys, bring some water." When the vessel was half filled, it stood upright; but when the water reached the brim, the centre of gravity was shifted and the vessel overturned. Suddenly Confucius changed countenance saying, "Perfect is the lesson of holding the full vessel!" Tz&ucirc; Kung, standing at his side, said, "Please tell us more of this holding of a full vessel." "Superfluity brings its penalty. There is danger in superabundance," said Confucius. "What do you mean by this?" "When a thing has reached luxuriance, decay has

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence quick intelligence and a rich wisdom should be preserved by simplicity, encyclopaedic information and wide attainments by lowliness, martial strength and bold courage by awe, great wealth and position by economy, universal beneficence by reserve and modesty. It was by observing these five qualities that the empire was preserved. History affirms that the spirit of these five principles could not be contravened with impunity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>A criticism of current methods of government which were based on opportunism and therefore a great contrast to true government based on the Tao.</I>&#8212;Wu Wang enquired of T&#8219;ai Kung an opinion on his action in punishing Chou, whether the world would not look on it as the murder of a master by his servant, and whether his fears were groundless that the example might be followed by later ages, giving rise to constant employment of troops and the perpetuation of strifes. T&#8219;ai Kung replied that the king's question was most excellent, saying, in illustration, that sportsmen were anxious lest the hit was too slight before they had the prey: but, once they had the bag, the fear was lest the flesh had been torn too much. Did the king therefore desire to hold the nation securely for long, he should shut up the avenue of the senses, i.e. the eye, ear, nose, mouth of the people.</P>

be made to be in mourning for three years so that the population be diminished. Let the high refuse office and the masses yield their rights, and so keep them from strifes and struggles. Let them rejoice in social feasts and be amused with music and orchestras: let them be awed by religion: multiply etiquettes and swell ceremonies in profusion, so that simplicity of nature may be buried in these artificialities: let burials be costly and mourning be protracted, in order to weaken the family power. Let them spend freely on pearls and ornaments: on silk tassels elaborately worked, so that they may be impoverished. Let them dig deep trenches and build high walls to exhaust their energies. Impoverished in family wealth, diminished in population, their whole attention will be concerned with their poverties. Let social reforms move on these lines and it will be possible to keep the country without the fear of loss. As Lao Tz&ucirc; says: (Chap. 37.)</P>
