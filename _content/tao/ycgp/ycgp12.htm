<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Po-ch&ecirc;ng-tse-kao<A NAME="page_52_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_52_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> would not part with a hair of his body for the benefit of others. He quitted

his country and became a ploughman. The great Y&uuml;<A NAME="page_53_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_53_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> did not profit by his own body, which grew quite emaciated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the ancients by injuring a single hair could have rendered a service to the world, they would not have done it; and had the universe been offered to a single person, he would not have accepted it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As nobody would damage even a hair, and nobody would do a favour to the world, the world was in a perfect state."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch&#8217;in-Tse asked Yang Chu:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If by pulling out a hair of your body you would aid mankind, would you do it?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yang Chu answered:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mankind is surely not to be helped by a single hair."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch&#8217;in-Tse said:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But supposing it possible, would you do it?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yang Chu gave no answer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Ch&#8217;in-Tse told Meng-sun-Yang, who replied:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will explain the Master's meaning.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supposing for tearing off a piece of your skin you were offered ten thousand gold pieces, would you do it?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch&#8217;in-Tse said:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would."</P>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meng-sun-Yang again asked:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supposing for cutting off one of your limbs you were to get a kingdom, would you do it?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch&#8217;in-Tse was silent.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See now," said Meng-sun-Yang. "A hair is unimportant compared with the skin, and the skin also is unimportant compared with a limb.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, many hairs put together form skin, and many skins form a limb. Therefore, though a hair is but one among the many molecules composing the body, it is not to be disregarded."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch&#8217;in-Tse replied:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do not know how to answer you. If I were to ask Lao-tse and Kuan-Yin,<A NAME="page_54_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_54_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> your opinion would be found right, and so also if I were to consult great Y&uuml; and Me-ti."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meng-sun-Yang upon this turned round to his disciples, and spoke of something else.</P>
