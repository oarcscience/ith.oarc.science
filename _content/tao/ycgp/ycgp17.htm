<P>Y<SMALL>ANG</SMALL> C<SMALL>HU</SMALL> said:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are four things which do not allow people to rest:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long life. Reputation. Rank. Riches.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who have them fear ghosts, fear men, power, and punishment. They are always fugitives. Whether they are killed or live they regulate their lives by externals.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who do not set their destiny at defiance do not desire a long life, and those who are not fond of honour do not desire reputation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who do not want power desire no rank.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who are not avaricious have no desire for riches.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of this sort of men it may be truthfully said

that they live in accordance with their nature. In the whole world they have no equal.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They regulate their life by inward things.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is an old proverb which says:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without marriage and an official career a man would be free from half of his yearnings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If men could do without clothes and food there would be no more kings or subjects."</P>
