## CHAPTER XIV <span class="small">DIFFICULTY AND EASE OF GOVERNMENT</span>

Y<span class="small">ANG</span> C<span class="small">HU</span> had an
audience with the King of Leang.

   Yang Chu said: "To govern the world is as easy as to turn round the
palm of the hand."

   The King of Leang said:

   "You have a wife and a concubine, Master, but are unable to govern
them. You have a garden of three acres, but are unable to weed it. How
then can you say that governing the world is like turning round the palm
of the hand?"

   Yang Chu said:

   "Observe, your Majesty, the shepherds. One allows a boy only five
feet high to shoulder a whip and drive a hundred sheep. He wants them to
go eastward, and they obey him, or westward, and they obey him. Now let
Yao drag a sheep, and Shen follow with a whip, and they will never
advance a yard. Fishes that swallow ships do not enter into small
rivers.

   "Wild geese that soar on high do not light on low marshes, but are
borne over in their flights. The notes C and Cis do not harmonise with
brisk and lively airs, for the sound is too different. Thus a man who
manages important matters does not trouble himself about trifles. And he
who accomplishes great deeds does no small ones. That was my meaning."
