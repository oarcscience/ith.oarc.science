Yang Chu was a philosopher of the classic age of Chinese thought who
probably lived in the 300's B.C.E. He has been associated with the
Taoists since the rise of official Confucianism and the consolidation of
what we now call 'Taoism', although this term is problematic, as
thinkers like Yang Chu, Chuang Tzu, and Lao Tzu are quite different and
were not considered to be members of a single school in ancient times.
In addition, the text that we still have which is attributed to Yang Chu
is from a somewhat later period, preserved in the *Lieh Tzu* (other
extracts of which are also available at Intangible Textual Heritage in
the book [*Taoist Teachings*](../tt/index)), which did not reach its
final form until perhaps 400 C.E. or so. In this text, Yang Chu is far
from being a mystic, and is concerned mainly with enjoying life to its
fullest, allowing a person's individual character the fullest expression
possible and not interfering with natural processes.
