## CHAPTER XVII <span class="small">THE FOUR CHIMERAS</span>

Y<span class="small">ANG</span> C<span class="small">HU</span> said:

   "There are four things which do not allow people to rest:

   "Long life. Reputation. Rank. Riches.

   "Those who have them fear ghosts, fear men, power, and punishment.
They are always fugitives. Whether they are killed or live they regulate
their lives by externals.

   "Those who do not set their destiny at defiance do not desire a long
life, and those who are not fond of honour do not desire reputation.

   "Those who do not want power desire no rank.

   "Those who are not avaricious have no desire for riches.

   "Of this sort of men it may be truthfully said <span id="page_62">p.
62</span> that they live in accordance with their nature. In the whole
world they have no equal.

   "They regulate their life by inward things.

   "There is an old proverb which says:

   "Without marriage and an official career a man would be free from
half of his yearnings.

   "If men could do without clothes and food there would be no more
kings or subjects."
