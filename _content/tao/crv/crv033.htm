<P>1. "Good travelers leave no trace nor track,<BR>
Good speakers, in logic show no lack,<BR>
Good counters need no counting rack. <A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A></P>
<P>2. "Good lockers bolting bars need not,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet none their locks can loose.<BR>
Good binders need no string nor knot,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet none unties their noose."</P></DIR>

<P>3. Therefore the holy man is always a good saviour of men, for there are no outcast people. He is always a good saviour of things, for there are no outcast things. This is called applied enlightenment.</P>
<P>4. Thus the good man does not respect multitudes of men. The bad man respects the people's wealth. Who does not esteem multitudes nor is charmed by their wealth, though his knowledge be greatly confused, he must be recognized as profoundly spiritual.</P>
