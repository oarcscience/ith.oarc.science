<P>Plato scholars will note that the famous dialogue "Parmenides," discussing the problem of the one and the many, may fitly be compared with Lao-tze's exposition of the nature of oneness, the poetical portion of which sounds like a philosophical rhapsody.</P>
<P>The simile that the carriage does not consist of its parts, but it a definite combination of its parts, is also used in the Buddhist book, "Questions of King Milinda," written several centuries after Lao-tze.</P>

<P>The last line in section 7, <I>Ta fang wu y&uuml;</I> (literally, "Greatest square has no corner") should be compared with the same sentiment in Chapter 45, <I>ta chih joh ch&#145;&uuml;</I> ("greatest straightness seems curved").</P>
