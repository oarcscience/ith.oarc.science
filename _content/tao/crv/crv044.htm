<P>2. Superior virtue is non-assertion and without pretension. Inferior virtue asserts and makes pretensions.</P>
<P>3. Superior benevolence acts but makes no pretensions. Superior justice acts and makes pretensions.</P>
<P>4. Superior propriety acts and when <A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A> no one responds to it, it stretches its arm and enforces its rules.</P>
<P>5. Thus one loses Reason and then virtue appears. One loses virtue and then benevolence appears. One loses benevolence and then justice appears. One loses justice and then propriety appears. The rules of propriety are the semblance of loyalty and faith, and the beginning of disorder.</P>
<P>6. Traditionalism is the flower of Reason, but of ignorance the beginning.</P>
<P>7. Therefore a great organizer abides by the solid and dwells not in the external. He abides in the fruit and dwells not in the flower.</P>
<P>8. Therefore he discards the latter and chooses the former.</P>
