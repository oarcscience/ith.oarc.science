<P>Now consider that thrift is said to come from early practice.</P>
<P>2. By early practice it is said that we can accumulate an abundance of virtue. If one accumulates an abundance of virtue then there is nothing that can not be overcome.</P>
<P>3. When nothing can not be overcome then no one knows his limit. When no one knows his limit one can have possession of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>4. Who has possession of the commonwealth's mother [thrift] may last and abide.</P>
<P>5. This is called the possession of deep roots and of a staunch stem. To life, to everlastingness, to comprehension, this is the way.</P>
