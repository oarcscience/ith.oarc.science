<P>2. When an average scholar hears of Reason he will sometimes keep it and sometimes lose it.</P>
<P>3. When an inferior scholar hears of Reason he will greatly ridicule it. Were it not thus ridiculed, it would as Reason be insufficient.</P>
<P>4. Therefore the poet says:</P><DIR>

<P>5. "The Reason--enlightened seem dark and black, <A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A><BR>
The Reason--advanced seem going back,<BR>
The Reason--straight-levelled seem rugged and slack.</P>
<P>6. "The high in virtue resemble a vale,<BR>
The purely white in shame must quail,<BR>
The staunchest virtue seems to fail.</P>
<P>7. "The solidest virtue seems not alert,<BR>
The purest chastity seems pervert,<BR>
The greatest square will rightness desert.</P>
<P>8. "The largest vessel is not yet complete,<BR>
The loudest sound is not speech replete,<BR>
The greatest form has no shape concrete."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>9. Reason so long as it remains latent is unnamable. Yet Reason alone is good for imparting and completing.</P>
