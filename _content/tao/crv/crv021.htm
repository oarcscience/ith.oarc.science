<TABLE  ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/tao15.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"></TD></TR></TABLE>1. Those of yore who have succeeded in becoming masters are subtile, spiritual, profound, and penetrating. On account of their profundity they can not be understood. Because they can not be understood, therefore I endeavor to make them intelligible.</P>
<P>2. How cautious they are! Like men in winter crossing a river. How reluctant! Like men fearing in the four quarters their neighbors. How reserved! They behave like guests. How elusive! They resemble ice when melting. How simple! They resemble rough wood. <A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A> How empty! They resemble the valley. How obscure! They resemble troubled waters.</P>
<P>3. Who by quieting can gradually render muddy waters clear? Who by stirring can gradually quicken the still?</P>
<P>4. He who cherishes this Reason is not anxious to be filled. Since he is not filled, therefore he may grow old; without renewal he is complete.</P>
