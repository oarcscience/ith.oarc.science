<P>2. By sons and grandsons the sacrificial celebrations shall not cease.</P>
<P>3. Who cultivates Reason in his person, his virtue is genuine.</P>
<P>Who cultivates it in his house, his virtue is overflowing.</P>
<P>Who cultivates it in his township, his virtue is lasting.</P>
<P>Who cultivates it in his country, his virtue is abundant.</P>
<P>Who cultivates it in the world, his virtue is universal.</P>
<P>4. Therefore,</P>
<P>By one's person one tests persons.</P>
<P>By one's house one tests houses.</P>
<P>By one's township one tests townships.</P>
<P>By one's country one tests countries.</P>
<P>By one's world one tests worlds.</P>
<P>5. How do I know that the world is such? Through IT.</P>
