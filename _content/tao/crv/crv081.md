### 75. HARMED THROUGH GREED.

1\. The people hunger because their superiors consume too many taxes;
therefore they hunger. The people are difficult to govern because their
superiors are too meddlesome; therefore they are difficult to govern.
The people make light of death on account of the intensity of their
clinging to life; therefore they make light of death.

2\. He who is not bent on life is worthier than he who esteems life.
