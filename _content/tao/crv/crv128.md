### CHAPTER 63.

In the famous passage, "Requite hatred with virtue," the word *teh*,
"virtue," is

commonly translated "goodness." We grant that this is the meaning, but
we prefer a literal rendering. The sentence recalls Christ's injunction,
"Love your enemies," but it means that we should treat those who hate us
with justice and goodness, according to the rules of the Tao, the
eternal Reason. It is not so emphatic as the Christian saying, but it is
more logical and less paradoxical.

The sentence before the last means: Rash promises are easily made; and
if we take things easy in the beginning without thinking of the
consequences we shall soon be involved in complications.
