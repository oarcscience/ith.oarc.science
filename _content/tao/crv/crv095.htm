<P>The text of the first two sentences is difficult, and we deem our present version an improvement.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> Literally the beginning seems to read thus: "Being insistent in disciplining the sense soul." Mr. Ng Poon Chew writes: "The first two characters are verbs, there is no question as to that. The word <I>poh</I> is commonly understood by the Chinese to be the passive half of the human soul equivalent to <I>yin</I> in nature."</P>
<P>The Manchu version (as Dr. Laufer informs me) in agreement with a Chinese quotation of this passage by Huai Nan Tze takes all these sentences as queries.</P>
