### CHAPTER 28.

In order to understand what Lao-tze means by manhood and womanhood, by
brightness and blackness, by fame and shame, we must bear in mind what
has been said above in the explanation of Chapter 5 about the two
principles Yin and Yang. Compare also Lao-tze's views about honoring the
right in times of war and the left in times of peace (Chapter 31).
Manliness is not worth much unless tempered by womanliness, and a good
warrior is not warlike, a good fighter is not pugnacious (Chap. 68).

The word *chih* means "to carve, to form, to regulate," and as a noun
"law" or "norm." Lao-tze seems to mean that a government which upholds
great principles and rules according to the maxims of the Tao can never
do any harm.

Professor Giles translates, "a great principle can not be divided,"
which

he interprets to mean, that it applies universally. (See Emendations and
Comments to *Lao-Tze's Tao-Teh-King*, pp. xxi-xxii.)
