### CHAPTER 26.

The word *tsz’*, translated "gravity," is a peculiar phrase which
literally means "baggage wagon." The intermediate idea seems to be
"heaviness" or "gravity," the latter in the double sense (literal and
figurative) as used in English.

In our former edition it was translated "dignity."
