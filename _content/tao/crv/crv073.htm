<TABLE  ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/tao67.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"></TD></TR></TABLE>1. All in the world call me great; but I resemble the unlikely. Now a man is great only because he resembles the unlikely. Did he resemble the likely, how lasting, indeed, would his mediocrity be!</P>
<P>2. 1 have three treasures which I <A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A> cherish and prize. The first is called compassion. The second is called economy. The third is called not daring to come to the front in the world.</P>
<P>3. The compassionate can be brave; the economical can be generous; those who dare not come to the front in the world can become perfect as chief vessels.</P>
<P>4. Now, if people discard compassion and are brave; if they discard economy and are generous; if they discard modesty and are ambitious, they will surely die.</P>
<P>5. Now, the compassionate will in attack be victorious, and in defence firm. Heaven when about to save one will with compassion protect him.</P>
