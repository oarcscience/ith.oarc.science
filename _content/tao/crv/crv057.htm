The forces complete them. Therefore <A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A> among the ten thousand things there is none that does not esteem Reason and honor virtue.</P>
<P>2. Since the esteem of Reason and the honoring of virtue is by no one commanded, it is forever spontaneous.</P>
<P>3. Therefore it is said that Reason quickens all creatures, while virtue feeds them, raises them, nurtures them, completes them, matures them, rears them, and protects them.</P>
<P>4. To quicken but not to own, to make but not to claim, to raise but not to rule, this is called profound virtue.</P>
