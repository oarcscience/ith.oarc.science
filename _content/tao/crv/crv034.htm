<P>1. "Who his manhood shows<BR>
And his womanhood knows<BR>
Becomes the empire's river.<BR>
Is he the empire's river,<BR>
He will from virtue never deviate,<BR>
And home he turneth to a child's estate. <A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A></P>
<P>2. "Who his brightness shows<BR>
And his blackness knows<BR>
Becomes the empire's model.<BR>
Is he the empire's model,<BR>
Of virtue ne'er shall he be destitute,<BR>
And home he turneth to the absolute.</P>
<P>3. "Who knows his fame<BR>
And guards his shame<BR>
Becomes the empire's valley.<BR>
Is he the empire's valley,<BR>
For e'er his virtue will sufficient be,<BR>
And home he turneth to simplicity."</P></DIR>

<P>4. Simplicity, when scattered, becomes a vessel of usefulness. The holy man, by using it, becomes the chief leader; and truly, a great principle will never do harm.</P>
