1\. My words are very easy to understand and very easy to practise, but
in the world no one can understand, no one can practise them.

2\. Words have an ancestor; Deeds have a master \[viz., Reason\]. Since
he is not understood, therefore I am not understood. Those who
understand me are few, and thus I am distinguished.

3\. Therefore the holy man wears wool, and hides in his bosom his
jewels.
