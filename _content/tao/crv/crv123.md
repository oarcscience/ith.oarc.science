### CHAPTER 57.

When, as Hamlet says, "the time is out of joint," we observe that
political disorder produces restlessness among the people and in its
wake come startling events. The people are frightened and superstition
dominates their minds. The result is that ghosts will spook and the gods
will be angry, as stated in Chapter 60.
