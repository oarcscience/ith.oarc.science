<P>The word <I>shi</I>, "departing," may very well be understood in the sense of dying.</P>
<P>The word <I>fan</I> means literally "return," denoting "coming back," and in order</P>

<P>to imitate the terse Chinese text, the best translation for "having come back" is "home." Lao-tze says: "Reason, the great distant beyond, is our home."</P>
<P>Section 5 seems to be a gloss which slipped into the text. At any rate the bracketed portion is too trivial to come from the hand of Lao-tze.</P>
