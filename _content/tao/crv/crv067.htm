<P>2. The wife always through quietude conquers her husband, and by quietude renders herself lowly.</P>
<P>3. Thus a great state through lowliness toward small states will conquer the small states, and small states through lowliness toward great states will conquer great states.</P>
<P>4. Therefore some render themselves <A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A> lowly for the purpose of conquering; others are lowly and therefore conquer.</P>
<P>5. A great state desires no more than to unite and feed the people; a small state desires no more than to devote itself to the service of the people; but that both may obtain their wishes, the greater one must stoop.</P>
