<I>66,099 bytes</I> &emsp; <span class="c_b">The Tao te Ching is one of the most widely read sacred texts, due to its simplicity and depth.</span>
It appeal is universal, and has been found relevant by
Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and even Quantum Physicists.
Attributed to Lao-tzu, (580-500 B.C.), it may predate him by several
centuries.  The earliest known manuscripts of the Tao te Ching
date to the third century B.C.<P>
This translation is excerpted from Volume 39 of the Sacred Books of
the East.
