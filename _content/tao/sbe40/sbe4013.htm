<P>1. Confucius was on terms of friendship with Li&ucirc;-hs&icirc;a K&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_400"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, who had a brother named T&acirc;o Kih. This T&acirc;o Kih had 9,000 followers, who marched at their will through the kingdom, assailing and oppressing the different princes. They dug through walls and broke into houses; they drove away people's cattle and horses; they carried off people's wives and daughters. In their greed to get, they forgot the claims of kinship, and paid no regard to their parents and brethren. They did not sacrifice to their ancestors. Wherever they passed through the country, in the larger states the people guarded their city walls, and in the smaller the people took to their strongholds. All were distressed by them.</P>
<P>Confucius spoke to Li&ucirc;-hsi&acirc; K&icirc;, saying, 'Fathers should be able to lay down the law to their sons,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_167"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 167</FONT></A></P>
<P>and elder to instruct their younger brothers. If they are unable to do so, they do not fulfil the duties of the relationships which they sustain. You, Sir, are one of the most talented officers of the age, and your younger brother is this Robber Kih. He is a pest in the kingdom, and you are not able to instruct him better; I cannot but be ashamed of you, and I beg to go for you and give him counsel.' Li&ucirc;-hsi&acirc; K&icirc; replied, 'You say, Sir, that fathers must be able to lay down the law to their sons, and elder to instruct their younger brothers, but if sons will not listen to the orders of their fathers, nor the younger receive the lessons of their elder brothers, though one may have your powers of persuasion, what is to be done? And, moreover, Kih is a man whose mind is like a gushing fountain, and his will like a whirlwind; he is strong enough to resist all enemies, and clever enough to gloss over his wrong-doings. If you agree with him, he is glad; if you oppose him, he is enraged; and he readily meets men with the language of abuse. You must not go to him.'</P>
<P>Confucius, however, did not attend to this advice. With Yen Hui as his charioteer, and Dze-kung seated on the right, he went to see T&acirc;o Kih, whom he found with his followers halted on the south of Th&acirc;i-shan, and mincing men's livers, which he gave them to eat. Confucius alighted from his carriage, and went forward, till he saw the usher, to whom he said, 'I, Khung Khi&ucirc; of L&icirc;, have heard of the general's lofty righteousness,' bowing twice respectfully to the man as he said so. The usher went in and announced the visitor. But when T&acirc;o Kih heard of the arrival, he flew into a great</P>
<P><A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A></P>
<P>rage; his eyes became like blazing stars, and his hair rose up and touched his cap. 'Is not this fellow,' said he, 'Khung Khi&ucirc;, that artful hypocrite of L&ucirc;? Tell him from me, "You invent speeches and babble away, appealing without ground to (the examples of) W&auml;n and W&ucirc; The ornaments on your cap are as many as the branches of a tree, and your girdle is (a piece of skin) from the ribs of a dead ox. The more you talk, the more nonsense you utter. You get your food without (the labour of) ploughing, and your clothes without (that of) weaving. You wag your lips and make your tongue a drum-stick. You arbitrarily decide what is right and what is wrong, thereby leading astray the princes throughout the kingdom, and making its learned scholars not occupy their thoughts with their proper business. You recklessly set up your filial piety and fraternal duty, and curry favour with the feudal princes, the wealthy and the noble. Your offence is great; your crime is very heavy. Take yourself off home at once. If you do not do so, I will take your liver, and add it to the provision for to-day's food."'</P>
<P>But Confucius sent in another message, saying, I enjoy the good will of (your brother) K&icirc;, and I wish and hope to tread the ground beneath your tent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' When the usher had communicated this message, T&acirc;o Kih said, 'Make him come forward.' On this Confucius hastened forwards. Declining to take a mat, he drew hastily back, and bowed twice to T&acirc;o Kih, who in a great rage stretched</P>

<P>his legs apart, laid his hand on his sword, and with glaring eyes and a voice like the growl of a nursing tigress, said, 'Come forwards, Khi&ucirc;. If what you say be in accordance with my mind, you shall live; but, if it be contrary to it, you shall die.' Confucius replied, 'I have heard that everywhere under the sky there are three (most excellent) qualities. To be naturally tall and large, to be elegant and handsome without a peer, so that young and old, noble and mean, are pleased to look upon him;--this is the highest of those qualities. To comprehend both heaven and earth in his wisdom, and to be able to speak eloquently on all subjects;--this is the middle one of them. To be brave and courageous, resolute and daring, gathering the multitudes round him, and leading on his troops;--this is the lowest of them. Whoever possesses one of these qualities is fit to stand with his face to the south&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_402"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and style himself a Prince. But you, General, unite in yourself all the three. Your person is eight cubits and two inches in height; there is a brightness about your face and a light in your eyes; your lips look as if stained with vermilion; your teeth are like rows of precious shells; your voice is attuned to the musical tubes, and yet you are named "The Robber Kih." I am ashamed of you, General, and cannot approve of you. If you are inclined to listen to me, I should like to go as your commissioner to W&ucirc; and Y&uuml;eh in the south; to Kh&icirc; and L&ucirc; in the north; to Sung and Wei in the east; and to Zin and Kh&ucirc; in the west. I will get them to build for you a great city several hundred l&icirc; in size, to</P>

<P>establish under it towns containing several hundred thousands of inhabitants, and honour you there as a feudal lord. The kingdom will see you begin your career afresh; you will cease from your wars and disband your soldiers; you will collect and nourish your brethren, and along with them offer the sacrifices to your ancestors&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:--this will be a course befitting a sage and an officer of ability, and will fulfil the wishes of the whole kingdom.'</P>
<P>'Come forward, Khi&ucirc;,' said T&acirc;o Kih, greatly enraged. 'Those who can be persuaded by considerations of gain, and to whom remonstrances may be addressed with success, are all ignorant, low, and ordinary people. That I am tall and large, elegant and handsome, so that all who see me are pleased with me;--this is an effect of the body left me by my parents. Though you were not to praise me for it, do I not know it myself? And I have heard that he who likes to praise men to their face will also like to speak ill of them behind their back. And when you tell me of a great wall and a multitudinous people, this is to try to persuade me by considerations of gain, and to cocker me as one of the ordinary people. But how could such advantages last for long? Of all great cities there is none so great as the whole kingdom, which was possessed by Y&acirc;o and Shun, while their descendants (now) have not so much territory as would admit an awl&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Thang and Wa were both set up as the Sons of Heaven, but in after ages (their posterity) were cut</P>

<P>'And moreover I have heard that anciently birds and beasts were numerous, and men were few, so that they lived in nests in order to avoid the animals. In the daytime they gathered acorns and chestnuts, and in the night they roosted on the trees; and on account of this they are called the people of the Nest-builder. Anciently the people did not know the use of clothes. In summer they collected great stores of faggots, and in winter kept themselves warm by means of them; and on account of this they are called the people who knew how to take care of their lives. In the age of Sh&auml;n N&auml;ng, the people lay down in simple innocence, and rose up in quiet security. They knew their mothers, but did not know their fathers. They dwelt along with the elks and deer. They ploughed and ate; they wove and made clothes; they had no idea of injuring one another:--this was the grand time of Perfect virtue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_406"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Hwang-T&icirc;, however, was not able to perpetuate this virtuous state. He fought with Khih-y&ucirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_407"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the wild of Ko-l&ucirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_408"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> till the blood flowed over a hundred l&icirc;. When Y&acirc;o and Shun arose, they instituted their crowd of ministers. Thang banished his lord. King W&ucirc; killed K&acirc;u. Since that time the strong have oppressed the weak, and the many tyrannised over the few. From Thang and W&ucirc; downwards, (the</P>

<P>rulers) have all been promoters of disorder and confusion. You yourself now cultivate and inculcate the ways of W&auml;n and W&ucirc;; you handle whatever subjects are anywhere discussed for the instruction of future ages. With your peculiar robe and narrow girdle, with your deceitful speech and hypocritical conduct, you delude the lords of the different states, and are seeking for riches and honours. There is no greater robber than you are;--why does not all the world call you the Robber Khi&ucirc;, instead of styling me the Robber Kih?</P>
<P>'You prevailed by your sweet speeches on Dze-l&ucirc;, and made him your follower; you made him put away his high cap, lay aside his long sword, and receive your instructions, so that all the world said, "Khung Khi&ucirc; is able to arrest violence and repress the wrong-doer;" but in the end, when Dze-l&ucirc; wished to slay the ruler of Wei, and the affair proved unsuccessful, his body was exhibited in pickle over the eastern gate of the capital;--so did your teaching of him come to nothing.</P>
<P>'Do you call yourself a scholar of talent, a sage? Why, you were twice driven out of L&ucirc;; you had to run away from Wei; you were reduced to extremity in Kh&icirc;; you were held in a state of siege between Kh&auml;n and Zh&acirc;i; there is no resting-place for your person in the kingdom; your instructions brought Dze-l&ucirc; to pickle. Such have been the misfortunes (attending your course). You have done no good either for yourself or for others;--how can your doctrines be worth being thought much of?</P>
<P>'There is no one whom the world exalts so much as it does Hwang-T&icirc;, and still he was not able to perfect his virtue, but fought in the wilderness of</P>

King W&auml;n was imprisoned in Y&ucirc;-l&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_412"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. These are the six men of whom the world thinks the most highly, yet when we accurately consider their history, we see that for the sake of gain they all disallowed their true (nature), and did violence to its proper qualities and tendencies:--their conduct cannot be thought of but with deep shame.</P>
<P>'Among those whom the world calls men of ability and virtue were (the brothers) Po-&Icirc; and Sh&ucirc;-kh&icirc;. They declined the rule of K&ucirc;-k&ucirc;, and died of starvation on the hill of Sh&acirc;u-yang, leaving their bones and flesh unburied. P&acirc;o Zi&acirc;o vaunted his conduct, and condemned the world, but he died with his arms round a tree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_413"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. When Sh&auml;n-th&ucirc; T&icirc;'s remonstrances were not listened to, he fastened a stone on his back, and threw himself into the Ho, where he was eaten by the fishes and turtles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_414"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. Kieh Dze-thui was the most devoted (of followers), and cut a piece from his thigh as food for duke W&auml;n. But when the duke afterwards overlooked him (in</P>

<P>his distribution of favours), he was angry, and went away, and was burned to death with a tree in his arms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_415"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Wei Sh&auml;ng had made an appointment with a girl to meet him under a bridge; but when she did not come, and the water rose around him, he would not go away, and died with his arms round one of the pillars&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_416"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (The deaths of) these four men were not different from those of the dog that is torn in pieces, the pig that is borne away by a current, or the beggar (drowned in a ditch) with his alms-gourd in his hand. They were all caught as in a net by their (desire for) fame, not caring to nourish their life to its end, as they were bound to do.</P>
<P>'Among those whom the world calls faithful ministers there have been none like the prince P&icirc;-kan and W&ucirc; Dze-hs&uuml;. But Dze-hs&uuml;'s (dead) body was cast into the Kiang, and the heart of P&icirc;-kan was cut out. These two were what the world calls loyal ministers, but the end has been that everybody laughs at them. Looking at all the above cases, down to those of Dze-hs&uuml; and P&icirc;-kan, there is not one worthy to be honoured; and as to the admonitions which you, Khi&ucirc;, wish to impress on me, if you tell me about the state of the dead, I am unable to know anything about it; if you tell me about the things of men (alive), they are only such as I have stated, what I have heard and know all about. I will now tell you, Sir, my views about the condition of man. The eyes wish to look on beauty; the cars to hear music; the mouth to enjoy flavours; the will to be gratified. The greatest longevity man</P>

<P>can reach is a hundred years; a medium longevity is eighty years; the lowest longevity is sixty. Take away sickness, pining, bereavement, mourning, anxieties, and calamities, the times when, in any of these, one can open his mouth and laugh, are only four or five days in a month. Heaven and earth have no limit of duration, but the death of man has its (appointed) time. Take the longest amount of a limited time, and compare it with what is unlimited, its brief existence is not different from the passing of a crevice by one of king M&ucirc;'s horses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_417"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Those who cannot gratify their will and natural aims, and nourish their appointed longevity, are all unacquainted with the (right) Way (of life). I cast from me, Khi&ucirc;, all that you say. Be quick and go. Hurry back and say not a word more. Your Way is only a wild recklessness, deceitful, artful, vain, and hypocritical. It is not available to complete the true (nature of man); it is not worth talking about!'</P>
<P>Confucius bowed twice, and hurried away. He went out at the door, and mounted his carriage. Thrice he missed the reins as he tried to take hold of them. His eyes were dazed, and he could not see; and his colour was that of slaked lime. He laid hold of the cross-bar, holding his head down, and unable to draw his breath. When he got back, outside the east gate of (the capital of) L&ucirc;, he encountered Li&ucirc;-hsi&acirc; K&icirc;, who said to him, 'Here you are, right in the gate. For some days I have not seen you. Your carriage and horses are travel-stained;--have you not been to see T&acirc;o Kih?' Confucius</P>

<P>looked up to heaven, sighed, and said, 'Yes.' The other went on, 'And did he not set himself in opposition to all your views, as I said he would do?' 'He did. My case has been that of the man who cauterised himself without being ill. I rushed away, stroked the tiger's head, played with his whiskers, and narrowly escaped his mouth.'</P>
<P>2. Dze-kang&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_418"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> asked M&acirc;n K&acirc;u-the&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_419"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, saying, 'Why do you not pursue a (righteous) course? Without such a course you will not be believed in; unless you are believed in, you will not be employed in office; and if not employed in office, you will not acquire gain. Thus, if you look at the matter from the point of reputation, or estimate it from the point of gain, a righteous course is truly the right thing. If you discard the thought of reputation and gain, yet when you think over the thing in your own mind, you will see that the scholar should not be a single day without pursuing a (righteous) course.' Man Kau-teh said, 'He who has no shame becomes rich, and he in whom many believe becomes illustrious. Thus the greatest fame and gain would seem to spring from being without shame and being believed in. Therefore if you look at the matter from the point of reputation, or estimate it from the point of gain, to be believed in is the right thing. If you discard the thought of fame and gain, and think over the thing in your own mind, you will see that the scholar in the course which he pursues is (simply) holding fast his Heavenly (nature, and gaining nothing).'</P>

<P><A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A></P>
<P>Dze-kang said, 'Formerly Kieh and K&acirc;u each enjoyed the honour of being the sovereign, and all the wealth of the kingdom was his; but if you now say to a (mere) money-grabber, "Your conduct is like that of Kieh or K&acirc;u," he will look ashamed, and resent the imputation:--(these two sovereigns) are despised by the smallest men. Kung-n&icirc; and Mo T&icirc; (on the other hand) were poor, and common men; but if you say to a Prime Minister that his conduct is like that of Kung-n&icirc; or Mo T&icirc;, then he will be put out and change countenance, and protest that he is not worthy (to be so spoken of):--(these two philosophers) are held to be truly noble by (all) scholars. Thus it is that the position of sovereign does not necessarily connect with being thought noble, nor the condition of being poor and of common rank with being thought mean. The difference of being thought noble or mean arises from the conduct being good or bad.' M&acirc;n K&acirc;u-teh replied, 'Small robbers are put in prison; a great robber becomes a feudal lord; and in the gate of the feudal lord your righteous scholars will be found. For instance, Hsi&acirc;o-po&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_420"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the duke Hwan, killed his elder brother, and took his sister-in-law to himself, and yet Kwan Kung became his minister; and Thien Khang, styled Kh&auml;ng-dze, killed his ruler, and usurped the state&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_421"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and yet Confucius received a present of silks from him. In their discussions they would condemn the men, but</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A></P>
<P>in their conduct they abased themselves before them. In this way their words and actions must have been at war together in their breasts;--was it not a contradiction and perversity? As it is said in a book, "Who is bad? and who is good? The successful is regarded as the Head, and the unsuccessful as the Tail."</P>
<P>Dze-kang said, 'If you do not follow the usual course of what is held to be right, but observe no distinction between the near and remote degrees of kin, no difference between the noble and the mean, no order between the old and the young, then how shall a separation be made of the fivefold arrangement (of the virtues), and the six parties (in the social organisation)?' M&acirc;n K&acirc;u-teh replied, 'Y&acirc;o killed his eldest son, and Shun banished his half-brother&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_422"></A><A HREF="#fn_373"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:--did they observe the rules about the different degrees of kin? Thang deposed Kieh; king Wa overthrew K&acirc;u:--did they observe the righteousness that should obtain between the noble and the mean?

And further, you, Sir, are all for reputation, and I am all for gain; but where the actual search for reputation and gain may not be in accordance with principle and will not bear to be examined in the light of the right way, let me and you refer the matter to-morrow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to the decision of W&ucirc;-yo&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_379"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.'</P>
<P>(This W&ucirc;-yo) said, 'The small man pursues after wealth; the superior man pursues after reputation. The way in which they change their feelings and alter their nature is different; but if they were to cast away what they do, and replace it with doing nothing, they would be the same. Hence it is said, "Do not be a small man;--return and pursue after the Heavenly in you. Do not be a superior man;--follow the rule of the Heavenly in you. Be it crooked, be it straight, view the thing in the light of Heaven as revealed in you. Look all round on every side of it, and as the time indicates, cease your endeavours. Be it right, be it wrong, hold fast the ring in yourself in which all conditions converge. Alone by yourself, carry out your idea; ponder over the right way. Do not turn your course; do not try to complete your righteousness. You will fail in what you do. Do not haste to be rich; do not follow after your perfection. If you do, you will lose the heavenly in you."</P>

<P>see others taking that position and doing honour to us is the way to prolong life, and to secure the rest of the body and the satisfaction of the mind. You alone, Sir, however, have no idea of this. Is it that your knowledge is deficient? Is it that you have the knowledge, but want the strength to carry it into practice? Or is it that your mind is made up to do what you consider right, and never allow yourself to forget it?' Know-the-Mean replied, 'Here now is this man judging of us, his contemporaries, and living in the same neighbourhood as himself, that we consider ourselves scholars who have abjured all vulgar ways and risen above the world. He is entirely without the thought of submitting to the rule of what is right. He therefore studies ancient times and the present, and the differing questions about the right and wrong, and agrees with the vulgar ideas and influences of the age, abandoning what is most important and discarding what is most honourable, in order to be free to act as he does. But is he not wide of the mark when he thinks that this is the way to promote long life, and to secure the rest of the body and the satisfaction of the mind? He has his painful afflictions and his quiet repose, but he does not inquire how his body is so variously affected; he has his apprehensive terrors, and his happy joys, but he does not inquire how his mind has such different experiences. He knows how to pursue his course, but he does not know why he does so. Even if he had the dignity of the Son of Heaven, and all the wealth of the kingdom were his, he would not be beyond the reach of misfortunes and evils.' Dissatisfied rejoined, 'But riches are in every way advantageous to man.</P>

<P>With them his attainment of the beautiful and mastery of every art become what the perfect man cannot obtain nor the sagely man reach to; his appropriation of the bravery and strength of others enables him to exercise a powerful sway; his availing himself of the wisdom and plans of others makes him be accounted intelligent and discriminating; his taking advantage of the virtues of others makes him be esteemed able and good. Though he may not be the holder of a state, he is looked to with awe as a ruler and father. Moreover, music, beauty, with the pleasures of the taste and of power, are appreciated by men's minds and rejoiced in without any previous learning of them; the body reposes in them without waiting for the example of others. Desire and dislike, avoidance and pursuit, do not require any master;--this is the nature of man. Though the world may condemn one's indulgence of them, who can refrain from it?' Know-the-Mean replied, 'The action of the wise is directed for the good of the people, but they do not go against the (proper) rule and degree. Therefore when they have enough, they do not strive (for more); they have no further object, and so they do not seek for one. When they have not enough, they will seek for it; they will strive for it in every quarter, and yet not think of themselves as greedy. If they have (already) a superfluity, they will decline (any more); they will decline the throne, and yet not think of themselves as disinterested:--the conditions of disinterestedness and greediness are (with them) not from the constraint of anything external. Through their exercise of introspection, their power may be that of the sovereign, but they will not in</P>

<P>their nobility be arrogant to others; their wealth may be that of the whole kingdom, but they will not in their possession of it make a mock of others. They estimate the evils to which they are exposed, and are anxious about the reverses which they may experience. They think how their possessions may be injurious to their nature, and therefore they will decline and not accept them;--but not because they seek for reputation and praise.</P>
<P>'Y&acirc;o and Shun were the sovereigns, and harmony prevailed. It did so, not because of their benevolence towards the people;--they would not, for what was (deemed) admirable, injure their lives. Shan K&uuml;an and Hs&uuml; Y&ucirc; might have been the sovereigns, but they would not receive the throne;--not that they declined it without purpose, but they would not by its occupancy injure themselves. These all followed after what was advantageous to them, and declined what was injurious, and all the world celebrates their superiority. Thus, though they enjoy the distinction, they did what they did, not for the sake of the reputation and praise.'</P>
<P>Dissatisfied (continued his argument), saying, 'In thus thinking it necessary for their reputation, they bitterly distressed their bodies, denied themselves what was pleasant, and restricted themselves to a bare sustenance in order to sustain their life; but so they had life-long distress, and long-continued pressure till their death arrived.' Know-the-Mean replied, 'Tranquil ease is happiness; a superfluity is injurious:--so it is with all things, and especially it is so, where the superfluity is of wealth. The ears of the rich are provided with the music of bells, drums, flageolets and flutes; and their mouths are</P>
<P><A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A></P>
<P>stuffed with the flesh of fed beasts and with wine of the richest flavour; so are their desires satisfied, till they forget their proper business:--theirs may be pronounced a condition of disorder. Sunk deeply in their self-sufficiency, they resemble individuals ascending a height with a heavy burden on their backs:--their condition may be pronounced one of bitter suffering. They covet riches, thinking to derive comfort from them; they covet power, and would fain monopolise it; when quiet and retired, they are drowned in luxurious indulgence; their persons seem to shine, and they are full of boasting:--they may be said to be in a state of disease. In their desire to be rich and striving for gain, they fill their stores, and, deaf to all admonition, refuse to desist from their course. They are even more elated, and hold on their way:--their conduct may be pronounced disgraceful. When their wealth is amassed till they cannot use it, they clasp it to their breasts and will not part with it; when their hearts are distressed with their very fulness, they still seek for more and will not desist:--their condition may be said to be sad. In-doors they are apprehensive of pilfering and begging thieves, and out-of-doors they are afraid of being injured by plundering robbers; in-doors they have many chambers and partitions, and out-of-doors they do not dare to go alone:--they may be said to be in a state of (constant) alarm.</P>
<P>'These six conditions are the most deplorable in the world, but they forget them all, and have lost their faculty of judgment. When the evil comes, though they begged it with all the powers of their nature, and by the sacrifice of all their wealth, they could</P>
<P><A NAME="page_185"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 185</FONT></A></P>
<P>not bring back one day of untroubled peace. When they look for their reputation, it is not to be seen; when they seek for their wealth, it is not to be got. To task their thoughts, and destroy their bodies, striving for (such an end as) this;--is it not a case of great delusion?'</P>
