<P>1. Thien Dze-fang, sitting in attendance on the marquis W&auml;n of Wei&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, often quoted (with approbation) the words of Kh&icirc; Kung&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. The marquis said, 'Is Kh&icirc; Kung your preceptor?' Dze-fang replied, 'No. He only belongs to the same neighbourhood. In speaking about the T&acirc;o, his views are often correct, and therefore I quote them as I do.' The marquis went on, 'Then have you no preceptor?' 'I have.' And who is he? He is Tung-kwo Shun-dze&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.' 'And why, my Master, have I never heard you quote his words?' Dze-fang replied, 'He is a man who satisfies the true (ideal of humanity)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; a man in appearance, but (having the mind of) Heaven. Void of any thought of himself, he accommodates himself to others, and nourishes the true ideal that belongs to him. With all his purity, he is forbearing to others. Where they are without the T&acirc;o, he rectifies his demeanour, so that they understand it, and in consequence their own ideas melt</P>

<P>away and disappear. How should one like me be fit to quote his words?'</P>
<P>When Dze-fang went out, the marquis W&auml;n continued in a state of dumb amazement all the day. He then called Lung L&icirc;-khin, and said to him, 'How far removed from us is the superior man of complete virtue! Formerly I thought the words of the sages and wise men, and the practice of benevolence and righteousness, to be the utmost we could reach to. Since I have heard about the preceptor of Dze-fang, my body is all unstrung, and I do not wish to move, and my mouth is closed up, and I do not wish to speak;--what I have learned has been only a counterfeit of the truth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Yes, (the possession of Wei) has been an entanglement to me.'</P>
<P>2. W&auml;n-po Hs&uuml;eh-dze&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, on his way to Kh&iuml;, stayed some time in L&ucirc;, where some persons of the state begged to have an interview with him. He refused them, saying, 'I have heard that the superior men of these Middle States&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> understand the (subjects of) ceremony and righteousness, but are deplorably ignorant of the minds of men. I do not wish to see them.' He went on to Kh&icirc;; and on his way back (to the south), he again stayed in L&ucirc;, when the same persons begged as before for an interview. He then said, 'Formerly they asked to see me, and now again they seek an interview. They will afford me</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A></P>
<P>some opportunity of bringing out my sentiments.' He went out accordingly and saw the visitors, and came in again with a sigh. Next day the same thing occurred, and his servant said to him, 'How is it that whenever you see those visitors, you are sure to come in again sighing?' 'I told you before,' was the reply, 'that the people of these Middle States understand (the subjects of) ceremony and righteousness, but are deplorably ignorant of the minds of men. Those men who have just seen me, as they came in and went out would describe, one a circle and another a square, and in their easy carriage would be like, one a dragon and another a tiger. They remonstrated with me as sons (with their fathers), and laid down the way for me as fathers (for their sons). It was this which made me sigh.'</P>
<P>Kung-n&icirc; saw the man, but did not speak a word to him. Dze-l&ucirc; said, 'You have wished, Sir, to see this W&auml;n-po Hs&uuml;eh-dze for a long time; what is the reason that when you have seen him, you have not spoken a word?' Kung-n&icirc; replied, 'As soon as my eyes lighted on that man, the T&acirc;o in him was apparent. The situation did not admit of a word being spoken.'</P>
<P>3. Yen Y&uuml;an asked Kung-n&icirc;, saying, 'Master, when you pace quietly along, I also pace along; when you go more quickly, I also do the same; when you gallop, I also gallop; but when you race along and spurn the dust, then I can only stand and look, and keep behind you&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' The Master said, 'Hui, what do you mean?' The reply was, 'In saying that when you, Master, pace quietly along, I also pace</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A></P>
<P>along," I mean&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that when you speak, I also speak. By saying, "When you go more quickly, I also do the same," I mean I that when you reason, I also reason. By saying, "When you gallop, I also gallop," I mean&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that when you speak of the Way, I also speak of the Way; but by saying, "When you race along and spurn the dust, then I can only stare, and keep behind you," I am thinking how though you do not speak, yet all men believe you; though you are no partisan, yet all parties approve your catholicity; and though you sound no instrument, yet people all move on harmoniously before you, while (all the while) I do not know how all this comes about; and this is all which my words are intended to express&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</P>
<P>Kung-n&icirc; said, 'But you must try and search the matter out. Of all causes for sorrow there is none so great as the death of the mind;--the death of man's (body) is only next to it. The sun comes forth in the east, and sets in the extreme West;--all things have their position determined by these two points. All that have eyes and feet wait for this (sun), and then proceed to do what they have to do. When this comes forth, they appear in their places; when it sets, they disappear. It is so with all things. They have that for which they wait, and (on its arrival) they die; they have that for which they wait, and then (again) they live. When once I receive my frame thus completed, I remain unchanged, awaiting the consummation of my course.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A></P>
<P>I move as acted on by things, day and night without cessation, and I do not know when I will come to an end. Clearly I am here a completed frame, and even one who (fancies that he) knows what is appointed cannot determine it beforehand. I am in this way daily passing on, but all day long I am communicating my views to you; and now, as we are shoulder to shoulder you fail (to understand me);--is it not matter for lamentation? You are able in a measure to set forth what I more clearly set forth; but that is passed away, and you look for it, as if it were still existing, just as if you were looking for a horse in the now empty place where it was formerly exhibited for sale. You have very much forgotten my service to you, and I have very much forgotten wherein I served you. But nevertheless why should you account this such an evil? What you forget is but my old self; that which cannot be forgotten remains with me.'</P>
<P>4. Confucius went to see L&acirc;o Tan, and arrived just as he had completed the bathing of his head, and was letting his dishevelled hair get dry. There be was, motionless, and as if there were not another man in the world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Confucius waited quietly; and, when in a little time he was introduced, he said, 'Were my eyes dazed? Is it really you? Just now, your body, Sir, was like the stump of a rotten tree. You looked as if you had no thought of anything, as if you had left the society of men, and were standing in the solitude (of yourself).' L&acirc;o Tan replied, 'I was enjoying myself in thinking about the commencement</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></P>
<P>of things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' 'What do you mean?' 'My mind is so cramped, that I hardly know it; my tongue is so tied that I cannot tell it; but I will try to describe it to you as nearly as I can. When the state of Yin was perfect, all was cold and severe; when the state of Yang was perfect, all was turbulent and agitated. The coldness and severity came forth from Heaven; the turbulence and agitation issued from Earth. The two states communicating together, a harmony ensued and things were produced. Some one regulated and controlled this, but no one has seen his form. Decay and growth; fulness and emptiness; darkness and light; the changes of the sun and the transformations of the moon:--these are brought about from day to day; but no one sees the process of production. Life has its origin from which it springs, and death has its place from which it returns. Beginning and ending go on in mutual contrariety without any determinable commencement, and no one knows bow either comes to an end. If we disallow all this, who originates and presides over all these phenomena?'</P>
<P>Confucius said, 'I beg to ask about your enjoyment in these thoughts.' L&acirc;o Tan replied, 'The</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A></P>
<P>comprehension of this is the most admirable and the most enjoyable (of all acquisitions). The getting of the most admirable and the exercise of the thoughts in what is the most enjoyable, constitutes what we call the Perfect man.' Confucius said, 'I should like to hear the method of attaining to it.' The reply was, 'Grass-eating animals do not dislike to change their pastures; creatures born in the water do not dislike to change their waters. They make a small change, but do not lose what is the great and regular requirement (of their nature); joy, anger, sadness, and delight do not enter into their breasts (in connexion with such events). Now the space under the sky is occupied by all things in their unity. When they possess that unity and equally share it, then the four limbs and hundred members of their body are but so much dust and dirt, while death and life, their ending and beginning, are but as the succession of day and night, which cannot disturb their enjoyment; and how much less will they be troubled by gains and losses, by calamity and happiness! Those who renounce the paraphernalia of rank do it as if they were casting away so much mud; they know that they are themselves more honourable than those paraphernalia. The honour belonging to one's self is not lost by any change (of condition). Moreover, a myriad transformations may take place before the end of them is reached. What is there in all this sufficient to trouble the mind? Those who have attained to the T&acirc;o understand the subject.'</P>
<P>Confucius said, 'O Master, your virtue is equal to that of Heaven and Earth, and still I must borrow</P>
<P><A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> (some of your) perfect words (to aid me) in the cultivation of my mind. Who among the superior men of antiquity could give such expression to them?' L&acirc;o Tan replied, 'Not so. Look at the spring, the water of which rises and overflows; it does nothing, but it naturally acts so. So with the perfect man and his virtue;--he does not cultivate it, and nothing evades its influence. He is like heaven which is high of itself, like earth which is solid of itself, like the sun and moon which shine of themselves;--what need is there to cultivate it?'</P>
<P>Confucius went out and reported the conversation to Yen Hui, saying, 'In the (knowledge of the) T&acirc;o am I any better than an animalcule in vinegar? But for the Master's lifting the veil from me, I should not have known the grand perfection of Heaven and Earth.'</P>
<P>5. At an interview of Kwang-dze with duke &Acirc;i&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of L&ucirc;, the duke said, 'There are many of the Learned class in L&ucirc;; but few of them can be compared with you, Sir.' Kwang-dze replied, 'There are few Learned men in L&ucirc;.' 'Everywhere in L&ucirc;,' rejoined the duke, 'you see men wearing the dress of the Learned&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;--how can you say that they are few?' 'I have heard,' said Kwang-dze, 'that those of them who wear round caps know the times of heaven; that those who wear square shoes know the contour of the ground; and that those who saunter about with semicircular stones at their</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A></P>
<P>girdle-pendents settle matters in dispute as they come before them. But superior men who are possessed of such knowledge will not be found wearing the dress, and it does not follow that those who wear the dress possess the knowledge. If your Grace think otherwise, why not issue a notification through the state, that it shall be a capital offence to wear the dress without possessing the knowledge.' On this the duke issued such a notification, and in five days, throughout all L&ucirc;, there was no one who dared to wear the dress of the Learned. There was only one old man who came and stood in it at the duke's gate. The duke instantly called him in, and questioned him about the affairs of the state, when he talked about a thousand points and ten thousand divergences from them. Kwang-dze said, 'When the state of L&ucirc; can thus produce but one man of the Learned class, can he be said to be many?'</P>
<P>6. The ideas of rank and emolument did not enter the mind of P&acirc;i-l&icirc; Hs&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and so he became a cattle-feeder, and his cattle were all in fine condition. This made duke M&ucirc; of Khin forget the meanness of his position, and put the government (of his state) into his hands. Neither life nor death entered into the mind of (Shun), the Lord of Y&uuml;, and therefore he was able to influence others&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</P>

<P>drawn, the masters of the pencil all came (to undertake the task). Having received his instructions and made their bows, they stood, licking their pencils and preparing their ink. Half their number, however, remained outside. There was one who came late, with an air of indifference, and did not hurry forward. When he had received his instructions and made his bow, he did not keep standing, but proceeded to his shed. The duke sent a man to see him, and there he was, with his upper garment off, sitting cross-legged, and nearly naked. The ruler said, 'He is the man; he is a true draughtsman.'</P>
<P>8. King W&auml;n was (once) looking about him at Zang&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, when he saw an old man fishing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. But his fishing was no fishing. It was not the fishing of one whose business is fishing. He was always fishing (as if he had no object in the occupation). The king wished to raise him to office, and put the government into his hands, but was afraid that such a step would give dissatisfaction to his great ministers, his uncles, and cousins. He then wished to dismiss the man altogether from his mind, but he could not bear the thought that his people should be without (such a) Heaven (as their Protector). On this, (next) morning, he called together his great officers, and said to them, 'Last night, I dreamt that I saw a good man, with a dark complexion and a</P>

<P>beard, riding on a piebald horse, one half of whose hoofs were red, who commanded me, saying, "Lodge your government in the hands of the old man of Zang; and perhaps the evils of your people will be cured."' The great officers said eagerly, 'It was the king, your father.' King W&auml;n said, 'Let us then submit the proposal to the tortoise-shell.' They replied, 'It is the order of your father. Let not your majesty think of any other. Why divine about it?' (The king) then met the old man of, Zang, and committed the government to him. The statutes and laws were not changed by him; not a one-sided order (of his own) was issued; but when the king made a survey of the kingdom after three years, he found that the officers had destroyed the plantations (which harboured banditti), and dispersed their occupiers, that the superintendents of the official departments did not plume themselves on their successes, and that no unusual grain measures were allowed within the different states&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. When the officers had destroyed the dangerous plantations and dispersed their occupants, the highest value was set on the common interests; when the chiefs of departments did not plume themselves on their successes, the highest value was set on the common business; when unusual grain measures did not enter the different states, the different princes had no jealousies. On this king Min made the old man his Grand Preceptor, and asked him, with his own face to the north, whether his government might be extended to all the kingdom. The old</P>

<P>man looked perplexed and gave no reply, but with aimless look took his leave. In the morning he had issued his orders, and at night he had gone his way; nor was he heard of again all his life. Yen Y&uuml;an questioned Confucius, saying, 'Was even king W&auml;n unequal to determine his course? What had he to do with resorting to a dream?' Kung-n&icirc; replied, 'Be silent and do not say a word! King Win was complete in everything. What have you to do with criticising him? He only had recourse (to the dream) to meet a moment's difficulty.'</P>
<P>9. Lieh Y&uuml;-kh&acirc;u was exhibiting his archery&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to Po-hw&auml;n W&ucirc;-z&auml;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Having drawn the bow to its full extent, with a cup of water placed on his elbow, he let fly. As the arrow was discharged, another was put in its place; and as that was sent off, a third was ready on the string. All the while he stood like a statue. Po-hw&auml;n W&ucirc;-z&auml;n said, 'That is the shooting of an archer, but not of one who shoots without thinking about his shooting. Let me go up with you to the top of a high mountain, treading with you among the tottering rocks, till we arrive at the brink of a precipice, 800 cubits deep, and (I will then see) if you can shoot.' On this they went up a high mountain, making their way among the tottering rocks, till they came to the brink of a precipice 800 cubits deep. Then W&ucirc;-z&auml;n turned round and walked backwards, till his feet were two-thirds</P>

<P>of their length outside the edge, and beckoned Y&uuml;-kh&acirc;u to come forward. He, however, had fallen prostrate on the ground, with the sweat pouring down to his heels. Then the other said, 'The Perfect man looks up to the azure sky above, or dives down to the yellow springs beneath, or soars away to the eight ends of the universe, without any change coming over his spirit or his breath. But now the trepidation of your mind appears in your dazed eyes; your inward feeling of peril is extreme!'</P>
<P>10. Kien W&ucirc; asked Sun-sh&ucirc; &Acirc;o&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, saying, 'You, Sir, were thrice chief minister, and did not feel elated; you were thrice dismissed from that position, without manifesting any sorrow. At first I was in doubt about you, (but I am not now, since) I see how regularly and quietly the breath comes through your nostrils. How is it that you exercise your mind?' Sun-sh&ucirc; &Acirc;o replied, 'In what do I surpass other men? When the position came to me, I thought it should not be rejected; when it was taken away, I thought it could not be retained. I considered that the getting or losing it did not make me what I was, and was no occasion for any manifestation of sorrow;--that was all. In what did I surpass other men? And moreover, I did not know whether the honour of it belonged to the dignity, or to myself. If it belonged to the dignity, it was nothing to me; if it belonged to me, it had nothing</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A></P>
<P>to do with the dignity. While occupied with these uncertainties, and looking round in all directions, what leisure had I to take knowledge of whether men honoured me or thought me mean?'</P>
<P>Kung-n&icirc; heard of all this, and said, 'The True men of old could not be fully described by the wisest, nor be led into excess by the most beautiful, nor be forced by the most violent robber. Neither F&ucirc;-hs&icirc; nor Hwang-T&icirc; could compel them to be their friends. Death and life are indeed great considerations, but they could make no change in their (true) self; and how much less could rank and emolument do so? Being such, their spirits might pass over the Th&acirc;i mountain and find it no obstacle to them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; they might enter the greatest gulphs, and not be wet by them; they might occupy the lowest and smallest positions without being distressed by them. Theirs was the fulness of heaven and earth; the more that they gave to others, the more they had.'</P>
<P>The king of Kh&ucirc; and the ruler of Fan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> were sitting together. After a little while, the attendants of the king said, 'Fan has been destroyed three times.' The ruler of Fan rejoined, 'The destruction of Fan has not been sufficient to destroy what we had that was most deserving to be preserved.' Now,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A></P>
<P>if the destruction of Fan had not been sufficient to destroy that which it had most deserving to be preserved, the preservation of Kh&ucirc; had not been sufficient to preserve that in it most deserving to be preserved. Looking at the matter from this point of view, Fan had not begun to be destroyed, and Kh&ucirc; had not begun to be preserved.</P>

In the same way the process of beginning and ending, growth and decay, life and death go on, no one knows how, or how long.

Death is a small matter, merely as a change of feature; and Confucius acknowledges his immeasurable inferiority to L&acirc;o-dze.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_98"></A><A HREF="sbe4005.htm#fr_110">49:1</A> Duke &Acirc;i of L&ucirc; died in B.C. 468, a century and more before the birth of Kwang-dze. On that, as well as on other grounds, the paragraph cannot be genuine.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_99"></A><A HREF="sbe4005.htm#fr_111">49:2</A> Compare the thirty-eighth Book of the L&icirc; K&icirc;, where Confucius denies that there was any dress peculiar to the scholar.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_100"></A><A HREF="sbe4005.htm#fr_112">50:1</A> P&acirc;i-l&icirc; Hs&icirc;, a remarkable character of the seventh century B.C., who rose to be chief minister to M&ucirc;, the earl (or duke) of Khin, the last of the five Leading Princes of the kingdom. M&ucirc; died in B.C. 621. Mencius has much to say of P&acirc;i-l&icirc; Hs&icirc;.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_102"></A><A HREF="sbe4005.htm#fr_114">50:3</A> His first year as duke of Sung was B.C. 530. The point of the story is not clear.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_104"></A><A HREF="sbe4005.htm#fr_116">51:2</A> The old fisherman here was, no doubt, the first marquis of Kh&icirc;, after the establishment of the dynasty of K&acirc;u, known by various names, as L&uuml; Shang, Th&acirc;i-kung Wang, and Kiang Dze-y&acirc;. He did much for the new rule, but his connexion with kings W&auml;n and W&ucirc; is a mass of fables. The fishing as if he were not fishing betokened in him the aimlessness of the T&acirc;o.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_105"></A><A HREF="sbe4005.htm#fr_117">52:1</A> That is, that all combinations formed to resist and warp the course of justice had been put an end to.</P>

The legends or edifying stories about him are many; but Kwang-dze, I think, is the author of his being thrice raised and thrice dismissed from office.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_109"></A><A HREF="sbe4005.htm#fr_121">55:1</A> It is difficult to see why this should be predicated of the &#145;spirits' of the True men.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_110"></A><A HREF="sbe4005.htm#fr_122">55:2</A> Fan was a small state, held at one time by descendants of the famous duke of K&acirc;u;--see the Zo Khwan, I, vii, 6; V, xxiv, 2. But we do not know what had been the relations between the powerful Kh&ucirc; and the feeble Fan, which gave rise to and could explain the remarks made at the entertainment, more honourable to Fan than to Kh&ucirc;.</P>
