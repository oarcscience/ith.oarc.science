<P>1. The methods employed in the regulation of the world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are many; and (the employers of them) think each that the efficiency of his own method leaves nothing to be added to it.</P>
<P>But where is what was called of old 'the method of the T&acirc;o&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?' We must reply, 'It is everywhere.' But then whence does the spiritual&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in it come down? and whence does the intelligence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in it come forth? There is that which gives birth to the Sage, and that which gives his perfection to the King:--the origin of both is the One&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>Not to be separate from his primal source constitutes what we call the Heavenly man; not to be separate from the essential nature thereof constitutes what we call the Spirit-like man; not to be separate from its real truth constitutes what we call the Perfect man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</P>

<P>To regard Heaven as his primal Source, Its Attributes as the Root (of his nature), and the T&acirc;o as the Gate (by which he enters into this inheritance), (knowing also) the prognostics given in change and transformation, constitutes what we call the Sagely man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>To regard benevolence as (the source of all) kindness, righteousness as (the source of all) distinctions, propriety as (the rule of) all conduct, and music as (the idea of) all harmony, thus diffusing a fragrance of gentleness and goodness, constitutes what we call the Superior man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_485"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>To regard laws as assigning the different (social) conditions, their names as the outward expression (of the social duties), the comparison of subjects as supplying the grounds of evidence, investigation as conducting to certainty, so that things can be numbered as first, second, third, fourth (and so on):--(this is the basis of government). Its hundred offices are thus arranged; business has its regular course; the great matters of clothes and food are provided for; cattle are fattened and looked after; the (government) stores are filled; the old and weak, orphans and solitaries, receive anxious consideration:--in all these ways is provision made for the nourishment of the people.</P>
<P>How complete was (the operation of the T&acirc;o) in the men of old! It made them the equals of spiritual beings, and subtle and all-embracing as heaven and earth. They nourished all things, and produced</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_216"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 216</FONT></A></P>
<P>harmony all under heaven. Their beneficent influence reached to all classes of the people. They understood all fundamental principles, and followed them out to their graduated issues; in all the six directions went their penetration, and in the four quarters all things were open to them. Great and small, fine and coarse;--all felt their presence and operation. Their intelligence, as seen in all their regulations, was handed down from age to age in their old laws, and much of it was still to be found in the Historians. What of it was in the Shih, the Sh&ucirc;, the L&icirc;, and the Yo, might be learned from the scholars of Z&acirc;u&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and L&ucirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>', and the girdled members of the various courts. The Shih describes what should be the aim of the mind; the Sh&ucirc;, the course of events; the L&icirc; is intended to direct the conduct; the Yo, to set forth harmony; the Y&icirc;, to show the action of the Yin and Yang; and the Khun Khi&ucirc;, to display names and the duties belonging to them.</P>
<P>Some of the regulations (of these men of old), scattered all under heaven, and established in our Middle states, are (also) occasionally mentioned and described in the writings of the different schools.</P>
<P>There ensued great disorder in the world, and sages and worthies no longer shed their light on it. The T&acirc;o and its characteristics ceased to be regarded as uniform. Many in different places got</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_217"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 217</FONT></A></P>
<P>one glimpse of it, and plumed themselves on possessing it as a whole. They might be compared to the ear, the eye, the nose, or the mouth. Each sense has its own faculty, but their different faculties cannot be interchanged. So it was with the many branches of the various schools. Each had its peculiar excellence, and there was the time for the use of it; but notwithstanding no one covered or extended over the whole (range of truth). The case was that of the scholar of a corner who passes his judgment on all the beautiful in heaven and earth, discriminates the principles that underlie all things, and attempts to estimate the success arrived at by the ancients. Seldom is it that such an one can embrace all the beautiful in heaven and earth, or rightly estimate the ways of the spiritual and intelligent; and thus it was that the T&acirc;o, which inwardly forms the sage and externally the king&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, became obscured and lost its clearness, became repressed and lost its development. Every one in the world did whatever he wished, and was the rule to himself. Alas! the various schools held on their several ways, and could not come back to the same point, nor agree together. The students of that later age unfortunately did not see the undivided purity of heaven and earth, and the great scheme of truth held by the ancients. The system of the T&acirc;o was about to be torn in fragments all under the sky.</P>
<P>2. To leave no example of extravagance to future generations; to show no wastefulness in the use of</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_218"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 218</FONT></A></P>
<P>anything; to make no display in the degree of their (ceremonial) observances; to keep themselves (in their expenditure) under the restraint of strict and exact rule, so as to be prepared for occurring emergencies;--such regulations formed part of the system of the T&acirc;o in antiquity, and were appreciated by Mo T&icirc;, and (his disciple) Khin Hwa-l&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. When they heard of such ways, they were delighted with them; but they enjoined them in excess, and followed them themselves too strictly. (Mo) made the treatise 'Against Music,' and enjoined the subject of another, called 'Economy in Expenditure,' on his followers. He would have no singing in life, and no wearing of mourning on occasions of death. He inculcated Universal Love, and a Common Participation in all advantages, and condemned Fighting. His doctrine did not admit of Anger. He was fond also of Learning, and with it all strove not to appear different from others. Yet he did not agree with the former kings, but attacked the ceremonies and music of the ancients.</P>
<P>Hwang-T&icirc; had his Hsien-khih; Y&acirc;o, his T&acirc; Kang; Shun, his T&acirc; Sh&acirc;o; Y&uuml;, his T&acirc; Hsi&acirc;; Thang, his T&acirc; H&ucirc;; king W&auml;n, his music of the Phi-yung&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and king W&ucirc; and the duke of K&acirc;u made the W&ucirc;.</P>

<P>In the mourning rites of the ancients, the noble and mean had their several observances, the high and low their different degrees. The coffin of the Son of Heaven was sevenfold; of a feudal lord, fivefold; of a great officer, threefold; of other officers, twofold. But now Mo-dze alone, would have no singing during life, and no wearing of mourning after death. As the rule for all, he would have a coffin of elaeococca wood, three inches thick, and without any enclosing shell. The teaching of such lessons cannot be regarded as affording a proof of his love for men; his practising them in his own case would certainly show that he did not love himself; but this has not been sufficient to overthrow the views of Mo-dze. Notwithstanding, men will sing, and he condemns singing; men will wail, and he condemns wailing; men will express their joy, and he condemns such expression:--is this truly in accordance with man's nature? Through life toil, and at death niggardliness:--his way is one of great unkindliness. Causing men sorrow and melancholy, and difficult to be carried into practice, I fear it cannot be regarded as the way of a sage. Contrary to the minds of men everywhere, men will not endure it. Though Mo-dze himself might be able to endure it, how can the aversion of the world to it be overcome? The world averse to it, it must be far from the way of the (ancient) kings.</P>
<P>Mo-dze, in praise of his views, said, 'Anciently, when Y&uuml; was draining off the waters of the flood, he set free the channels of the Kiang and the Ho, and opened communications with them from the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_220"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 220</FONT></A></P>
<P>regions of the four &Icirc; and the nine provinces. The famous hills with which he dealt were 300, the branch streams were 3000, and the smaller ones innumerable. With his own hands he carried the sack and wielded the spade, till he had united all the streams of the country (conducting them to the sea). There was no hair left on his legs from the knee to the ankle. He bathed his hair in the violent wind, and combed it in the pelting rain, thus marking out the myriad states. Y&uuml; was a great sage, and thus he toiled in the service of the world.' The effect of this is that in this later time most of the Mohists wear skins and dolychos cloth, with shoes of wood or twisted hemp, not stopping day or night, but considering such toiling on their part as their highest achievement. They say that he who cannot do this is acting contrary to the way of Y&uuml;, and not fit to be a Mohist.</P>
<P>The disciples of Khin of Hsiang-l&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the followers of the various feudal lords&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and Mohists of the south, such as Kh&ucirc; Hu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, Ki Khih&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and T&auml;ng Ling-dze&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, all repeated the texts of Mo, but they differed in the objections which they offered to them, and in their deceitful glosses they called one another Mohists of different schools. They had their disputations, turning on 'what was hard,' and 'what was white,' what constituted 'sameness' and what 'difference,' and their expressions about the difference between 'the odd' and the even,' with which they answered one another. They regarded</P>

</P>
<P><A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A></P>
<P>their most distinguished member as a sage, and wished to make him their chief, hoping that he would be handed down as such to future ages. To the present day these controversies are not determined.</P>
<P>The idea of Mo T&icirc; and Khin Hwa-l&icirc; was good, but their practice was wrong. They would have made the Mohists of future ages feel it necessary to toil themselves, till there was not a hair on their legs, and still be urging one another on; (thus producing a condition) superior indeed to disorder, but inferior to the result of good government. Nevertheless, Mo-dze was indeed one of the best men in the world, which you may search without finding his equal. Decayed and worn (his person) might be, but he is not to be rejected,--a scholar of ability indeed!</P>
<P>3. To keep from being entangled by prevailing customs; to shun all ornamental attractions in one's self; not to be reckless in his conduct to others; not to set himself stubbornly against a multitude; to desire the peace and repose of the world in order to preserve the lives of the people; and to cease his action when enough had been obtained for the nourishment of others and himself, showing that this was the aim of his mind;--such a scheme belonged to the system of the T&acirc;o in antiquity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and it was appreciated by Sung Hsing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and Yin W&auml;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> When they heard of such ways, they were delighted with them. They made the Hwa-shan cap, and wore it as their distinguishing badge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. In their intercourse with others, whatever their differences might be, they began by being indulgent to them. Their name for 'the Forbearance of the Mind' was 'the Action of the Mind.' By the warmth of affection they sought the harmony of joy, and to blend together all within the four seas; and their wish was to plant this everywhere as the chief thing to be pursued. They endured insult without feeling it a disgrace; they sought to save the people from fighting; they forbade aggression and sought to hush the weapons of strife, to save their age from war. In this way they went everywhere, counselling the high and instructing the low. Though the world might not receive them, they only insisted on their object the more strongly, and would not abandon it. Hence it is said, 'The high and the low might be weary of them, but they were strong to show themselves.'</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this, they acted too much out of regard to others, and too little for themselves. It was as if they said, 'What we request and wish is simply that there may be set down for us five pints of rice;--that will be enough.' But I fear the Master would not get his fill from this; and the disciples, though famishing, would still have to be mindful of the world, and, never stopping day or night, have to say, 'Is it necessary I should preserve</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_223"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 223</FONT></A></P>
<P>my life? Shall I scheme how to exalt myself above the master, the saviour of the age?'</P>
<P>It was moreover as if they said, 'The superior man does not censoriously scrutinize (the faults of others); he does not borrow from others to supersede his own endeavours; when any think that he is of no use to the world, he knows that their intelligence is inferior to his own; he considers the prohibition of aggression and causing the disuse of arms to be an external achievement, and the making his own desires to be few and slight to be the internal triumph.' Such was their discrimination between the great and the small, the subtle and the coarse; and with the attainment of this they stopped.</P>
<P>4. Public-spirited, and with nothing of the partizan; easy and compliant, without any selfish partialities; capable of being led, without any positive tendencies; following in the wake of others, without any double mind; not looking round because of anxious thoughts; not scheming in the exercise of their wisdom; not choosing between parties, but going along with all;--all such courses belonged to the T&acirc;oists of antiquity, and they were appreciated by Ph&auml;ng M&auml;ng&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, Thien Phien&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and Sh&auml;n T&acirc;o&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. When they heard of such ways, they were delighted with them. They considered that the first thing for them to do was to adjust the controversies about different things. They said, 'Heaven can cover, but it cannot sustain; Earth can contain, but it can-</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_224"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 224</FONT></A></P>
<P>not cover. The Great T&acirc;o embraces all things, but It does not discriminate between them.'</P>
<P>They knew that all things have what they can do and what they cannot do. Hence it is said, 'If you select, you do not reach all; if you teach some things, you must omit the others; but the T&acirc;o neglects none.' Therefore Sh&auml;n T&acirc;o discarded his knowledge and also all thought of himself, acting only where he had no alternative, and pursued it as his course to be indifferent and pure in his dealings with others. He said that the best knowledge was to have no knowledge, and that if we had a little knowledge it was likely to prove a dangerous thing. Conscious of his unfitness, he undertook no charge, and laughed at those who valued ability and virtue. Remiss and evasive, he did nothing, and disallowed the greatest sages which the world had known. Now with a hammer, now with his hand, smoothing all corners, and breaking all bonds, he accommodated himself to all conditions. He disregarded right and wrong, his only concern being to avoid trouble; he learned nothing from the wise and thoughtful, and took no note of the succession of events, thinking only of carrying himself with a lofty disregard of everything. He went where he was pushed, and followed where he was led, like a whirling wind, like a feather tossed about, like the revolutions of a grindstone.</P>
<P>What was the reason that he appeared thus complete, doing nothing wrong? that, whether in motion or at rest, he committed no error, and could be charged with no transgression? Creatures that have no knowledge are free from the troubles that arise from self-assertion and the entanglements that spring from the use of knowledge. Moving and at</P>
<P><A NAME="page_225"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 225</FONT></A></P>
<P>rest) they do not depart from their proper course, and all their life long they do not receive any praise. Hence (Sh&auml;n T&acirc;o) said, 'Let me come to be like a creature without knowledge. Of what use are the (teachings of the) sages and worthies?' But a clod of earth never fails in the course (proper for it), and men of spirit and eminence laughed together at him, and said, 'The way of Sh&auml;n T&acirc;o does not describe the conduct of living men; that it should be predicable only of the dead is strange indeed!'</P>
<P>It was just the same with Thien Phien. He learned under Ph&auml;ng M&auml;ng, but it was as if he were not taught at all. The master of Ph&auml;ng M&auml;ng said, 'The T&acirc;oist professors of old came no farther than to say that nothing was absolutely right and nothing absolutely wrong.' His spirit was like the breath of an opposing wind; how can it be described in words? But he was always contrary to (the views of) other men, which he would not bring together to view, and he did not escape shaving the corners and bonds (of which I have spoken). What he called the T&acirc;o was not the true T&acirc;o, and what he called the right was really the wrong</P>
<P>Ph&auml;ng M&auml;ng, Thien Phien, and Shin T&acirc;o did not in fact know the T&acirc;o; but nevertheless they had heard in a general way about it.</P>
<P>5. To take the root (from which things spring) as the essential (part), and the things as its coarse (embodiment); to see deficiency in accumulation; and in the solitude of one's individuality to dwell with the spirit-like and intelligent;--such a course belonged to the T&acirc;o of antiquity, and it was appreciated</P>
<P><A NAME="page_226"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 226</FONT></A></P>
<P>by Kwan Yin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and L&acirc;o Tan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. When they heard of such ways, they were delighted with them. They built their system on the assumption of an eternal non-existence, and made the ruling idea in it that of the Grand Unity. They made weakness and humility their mark of distinction, and considered that by empty vacuity no injury could be sustained, but all things be preserved in their substantiality.</P>
<P>Kwan Yin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> says, 'To him who does not dwell in himself the forms of things show themselves as they are. His movement is like that of water; his stillness is like that of a mirror; his response is like that of the echo. His tenuity makes him seem to be disappearing altogether; he is still as a clear (lake), harmonious in his association with others, and he counts gain as loss. He does not take precedence of others, but follows them.' L&acirc;o Tan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> says, 'He knows his masculine power, but maintains his female weakness,--becoming the channel into which all streams flow. He knows his white purity, but keeps his disgrace,--becoming the valley of the world. Men all prefer to be first; he alone chooses to be last, saying, "I will receive the offscourings of the world." Men all choose fulness; he alone chooses emptiness. He does not store, and therefore he has a superabundance; he looks solitary, but has a multitude around him. In his conducting</P>

<P>of himself he is easy and leisurely and wastes nothing. He does nothing, and laughs at the clever and ingenious. Men all seek for happiness, but he feels complete in his imperfect condition, and says, "Let me only escape blame." He regards what is deepest as his root, and what is most restrictive as his rule; and says, "The strong is broken; the sharp and pointed is blunted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." He is always generous and forbearing with others, and does not encroach on any man;--this may be pronounced the height (of perfection).'</P>
<P>O Kwan Yin, and L&acirc;o Tan, ye were among the greatest men of antiquity; True men indeed!</P>
<P>6. That the shadowy and still is without bodily form; that change and transformation are ever proceeding, but incapable of being determined. What is death? What is life? What is meant by the union of Heaven and Earth? Does the spiritual intelligence go away? Shadowy, where does it go? Subtle, whither does it proceed? All things being arranged as they are, there is no one place which can be fitly ascribed to it. Such were the questions belonging to the scheme of T&acirc;o in antiquity, and they were appreciated by Kwang K&acirc;u. When he heard of such subjects, he was delighted with them. (He discussed them), using strange and mystical expressions, wild and extravagant words, and phrases to which no definite meaning could be assigned. He constantly indulged his own wayward ideas, but did not make himself a partisan, nor look at them as peculiar to himself. Considering that men were</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_228"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 228</FONT></A></P>
<P>sunk in stupidity and could not be talked to in dignified style, he employed the words of the cup of endless application, with important quotations to substantiate the truth, and an abundance of corroborative illustrations. He chiefly cared to occupy himself with the spirit-like operation of heaven and earth, and did not try to rise above the myriads of things. He did not condemn the agreements and differences of others, so that he might live in peace with the prevalent views. Though his writings may seem to be sparkling trifles, there is no harm in amusing one's self with them; though his phraseology be ever-varying, its turns and changes are worth being looked at;--the fulness and completeness of his ideas cannot be exhausted. Above he seeks delight in the Maker; below, he has a friendly regard to those who consider life and death as having neither beginning nor end. As regards his dealing with the Root (origin of all things), he is comprehensive and great, opening up new views, deep, vast, and free. As regards the Author and Master (the Great T&acirc;o Itself), he may be pronounced exact and correct, carrying our thoughts to range and play on high. Nevertheless on the subject of transformation, and the emancipation of that from (the thraldom of) things, his principles are inexhaustible, and are not derived from his predecessors. They are subtle and obscure, and cannot be fully explained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</P>

<P>7. Hui Shih&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_450"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> had many ingenious notions. His writings would fill five carriages; but his doctrines were erroneous and contradictory, and his words were wide of their mark. Taking up one thing after another, he would say:--'That which is so great that there is nothing outside it may be called the Great One; and that which is so small that there is nothing inside it may be called the Small One.' 'What has no thickness and will not admit of being repeated is 1000 l&icirc; in size&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' 'Heaven may be as low as the earth.' 'A mountain may be as level as a marsh.' 'The sun in the meridian may be the sun declining.' 'A creature may be born to life and may die at the same time.' '(When it is said that) things greatly alike are different from things a little alike, this is what is called making little of agreements and differences; (when it is said that) all things are entirely alike or entirely different, this is what is called making much of agreements and differences.' 'The south is unlimited and yet has a limit.' 'I proceed to Yueh to-day and came to it yesterday.' 'Things which are joined together can be separated.' 'I know the centre of the world;--it is north of Yen or south of Yueh.' 'If all things be regarded with love, heaven and earth are of one body (with me).'</P>

<P>very conspicuous throughout the kingdom, and was considered an able debater. All other debaters vied with one another and delighted in similar exhibitions. (They would say), 'There are feathers in an egg.' 'A fowl has three feet.' 'The kingdom belongs to Ying.' 'A dog might have been (called) a sheep.' 'A tadpole has a tail.' 'Fire is not hot.' 'A mountain gives forth a voice.' 'A wheel does not tread on the ground.' 'The eye does not see.' 'The finger indicates, but needs not touch, (the object).' 'Where you come to may not be the end.' 'The tortoise is longer than the snake.' 'The carpenter's square is not square.' 'A compass should not itself be round.' 'A chisel does not surround its handle.' 'The shadow of a flying bird does not (itself) move.' 'Swift as the arrowhead is, there is a time when it is neither flying nor at rest.' 'A dog is not a hound.' 'A bay horse and a black ox are three.' 'A white dog is black.' 'A motherless colt never had a mother.' 'If from a stick a foot long you every day take the half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted.'--It was in this way that the debaters responded to Hui Shih, all their lifetime, without coming to an end.</P>
<P>Hwan Twan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_452"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and Kung-sun Lung&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> were true members of this class. By their specious representations they threw a glamour over men's minds and altered their ideas. They vanquished men in argument, but could not subdue their minds, only keeping them in the enclosure of their sophistry. Hui Shih daily used his own knowledge and the arguments of others to propose strange theses to all debaters</P>

<P>such was his practice. At the same time he would talk freely of himself, thinking himself the ablest among them, and saying, 'In heaven or earth who is my match?' Shih maintained indeed his masculine energy, but he had not the art (of controversy).</P>
<P>In the south there was a man of extraordinary views, named Hwang Li&acirc;o&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_454"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, who asked him how it was that the sky did not fall nor the earth sink, and what was the cause of wind, rain, and the thunder's roll and crash. Shih made no attempt to evade the questions, and answered him without any exercise of thought, talking about all things, without pause, on and on without end; yet still thinking that his words were few, and adding to them the strangest observations. He thought that to contradict others was a real triumph, and wished to make himself famous by overcoming them; and on this account he was not liked by the multitude of debaters. He was weak in real attainment, though he might seem strong in comparison with others, and his way was narrow and dark. If we look at Hui Shih's ability from the standpoint of Heaven and Earth, it was only like the restless activity of a mosquito or gadfly; of what service was it to anything? To give its full development to any one capacity is a good thing, and he who does so is in the way to a higher estimation of the T&acirc;o; but Hui Shih could find no rest for himself in doing this. He diffused himself over the world of things without satiety, till in the end he had only the reputation of being a skilful debater. Alas! Hui Shih, with</P>

<P><A NAME="page_232"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 232</FONT></A></P>
<P>all his talents, vast as they were, made nothing out; he pursued all subjects and never came back (with success). It was like silencing an echo by his shouting, or running a race with his shadow. Alas!</P>

In this brief phrase is the one recognition, by our author, of the existence and work of Mencius, who was 'the scholar of Z&acirc;u.' But one is not prepared for the comparatively favourable judgment passed on those scholars, and on what we call the Confucian classics.
