<P>THE Exalted One says:<SUP>[3]</SUP> (1-3)</P>
<P>Curses and blessings do not come through gates,<SUP>[4]</SUP> but man himself invites their arrival.<SUP>[5]</SUP> (4-11)</P>
<P>The reward of good and evil is like the shadow accompanying a body, and so it is apparent<SUP>[6]</SUP> that heaven and earth are possessed of crime-recording spirits. (12-28)</P>
<P>According to<SUP>[7]</SUP> the lightness or gravity of his transgressions,<SUP>[8]</SUP> the sinner's term of life is reduced. Not only is his term of life reduced, but poverty<SUP>[9]</SUP> also strikes him. Often he meets with calamity and misery.<SUP>[9]</SUP> His neighbors<SUP>[10]</SUP> hate him. Punishments and curses pursue him. Good luck shuns him. Evil stars threaten him; and when his term of life comes to an end, he perishes. (29-67)</P>
<P>Further, there are the three councilor<SUP>[11]</SUP>, spirit-lords of the northern constellation,<SUP>[12]</SUP> residing above the heads of the people, recorders</P>
<P>{p. 52}</P>
<P>of men's crimes and sins,<SUP>[9]</SUP> cutting off terms of from twelve years to a hundred days. (68-87)</P>
<P>Further, there are the three body-spirits<SUP>[13]</SUP> that live within man's person. Whenever K&ecirc;ng Sh&ecirc;n day<SUP>[14]</SUP> comes, they ascend to the heavenly master<SUP>[15]</SUP> and inform him of men's crimes and trespasses. (88-110)</P>
<P>On the last day of the month the Hearth Spirit,<SUP>[16]</SUP> too, does the same. (111-118)</P>
<P>Of all the offences which men commit, the greater ones cause a loss of twelve years, the smaller ones of a hundred days. These their offences, great as well as small, constitute some hundred affairs, and those who are anxious for life everlasting,<SUP>[17]</SUP> should above all avoid them.[18] (119-147)</P>
