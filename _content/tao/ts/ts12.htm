<P>Therefore, blessed is the man who speaketh what is good, who thinketh what is good, who practiceth what is good. If but each single day he would persevere in these three ways of goodness,<SUP>[65]</SUP> within three years Heaven will surely shower on him blessings. (1231-1251)</P>
<P>Unfortunate is the man who speaketh what is evil, who thinketh what is evil, who practiceth what is evil. If but each single day he would persevere in these three ways of evildoing, within three years Heaven will surely shower on him curses. (1252-1271)</P>
<P>Why shall we not be diligent and comply with this? (1272-1277)</P>
