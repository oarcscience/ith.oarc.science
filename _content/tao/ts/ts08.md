### (Punishments for Evil-Doers.)

For all these crimes the councilors of destiny deprive the guilty,
according to the lightness or gravity of the offence, of terms from
twelve years to a hundred days, and when the lease of life is exhausted
they perish. (1059-1076)

If at death an unexpiated offence be left, the evil luck will be
transferred to children and grandchildren. (1077-1085)

Moreover, all those who wrongly seize others' property may have to
compensate for it, with wives or children or other family members, the
expiation to be proportionate up to a punishment by death. (1086-1106)

If the guilt be not expiated by death, they will suffer by various
evils, by water, by fire, by theft, or by robbery, by loss of property,
by disease and illness, and by ill repute, to compensate for any
unlawful violence of justice. (1107-1132)

{p. 65}

Further, those who unlawfully kill men will in turn have their weapons
and arms turned on them; yea, they will kill each
other.<sup>\[62\]</sup> (1133-1145)
