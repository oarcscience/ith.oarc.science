### WAR

HE who serves a ruler of men in harmony with Tao will not subdue the
Empire by force of arms. Such a course is wont to bring retribution in
its train.

Where troops have been quartered, brambles and thorns spring up. In the
track of great armies there must follow lean years.

The good man wins a victory and then stops; he will not go on to acts of
violence. Winning, he boasteth not; he will not triumph; he shows no
arrogance. He wins because he cannot choose; after his victory he will
not be overbearing.

Weapons, however beautiful, are instruments of ill omen, hateful to all
creatures. Therefore he who has Tao will have nothing to do with them.

Where the princely man abides, the weak left hand is in honour. But he
who uses weapons honours the stronger right. Weapons are instruments of
ill omen; they are not the instruments of the princely man, who uses
them only when he needs must. Peace and tranquillity are what he prizes.
When he conquers, he is not elate. To be elate were to rejoice in the
slaughter of human beings. And he who rejoices in the slaughter of

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

human beings is not fit to work his will in the Empire.

On happy occasions, the left is favoured; on sad occasions, the right.
The second in command has his place on the left, the general in chief on
the right. That is to say, they are placed in the order observed at
funeral rites. And, indeed, he who has exterminated a great multitude of
men should bewail them with tears and lamentation. It is well that those
who are victorious in battle should be placed in the order of funeral
rites.

A certain military commander used to say: "I dare not act the host; I
prefer to play the guest. <span id="fr_6"></span>[\*](#fn_6) I dare not
advance an inch; I prefer to retreat a foot."

There is no greater calamity than lightly engaging in war. Lightly to
engage in war is to risk the loss of our treasure. <span

When opposing warriors join in battle, he who has pity conquers.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_6"></span>[42:\*](salt09.htm#fr_6) According to Chinese
etiquette, it is for the master of the house to make advances, and his
guest follows suit. Thus "host" here means the one who takes the
initiative and begins the attack; "guest," the one who acts on the
defensive. The passage may be merely figurative, illustrating the
conduct of those who practise Tao.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[42:†](salt09.htm#fr_7) *I.e.*, humanity or
gentleness, mentioned above as one or "three precious things."
