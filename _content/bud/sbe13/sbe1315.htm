<P ALIGN="center">(THE PAV&Acirc;RA<I>N</I>&Acirc; CEREMONY AT THE END OF THE RAINY SEASON, VASSA).</P>

<!--======================chapter 1======================-->

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>.</H3></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at S&acirc;vatthi, in the <I>G</I>etavana, the garden of An&acirc;thapi<I>nd</I>ika. At that time a number of Bhikkhus, companions and friends of each other, entered upon Vassa in a certain district of the Kosala country. Now those Bhikkhus thought: 'What shall we do in order that we may keep Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and that we may not suffer from want of food?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. Then those Bhikkhus thought: 'If we do not speak to or converse with each other, if he who comes back first from the village, from his alms-pilgrimage, prepares seats, gets water for washing the feet, a foot-stool, and a towel<A NAME="page_325_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_325_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>, cleans the slop-basin and gets it ready, and puts there (water to) drink and food,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:3"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT>. 'And if he who comes back last from the village, from his alms-pilgrimage, eats, if there is any food left (from the dinner of the other Bhikkhus) and if he desires to do so; and if he does not desire (to eat), throws it away at a place free from grass, or pours it away into water in which no living things are; puts away the water for washing the feet, the foot-stool, and the towel<A NAME="page_325_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_325_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>; cleans the slop-basin and

<!------------------------page 326------------------------>

<A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A>

puts it away, puts the water and the food away, and sweeps the dining-room,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:4"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT>. 'And if he, who sees a water-pot, or a bowl for food, or a vessel for evacuations, empty and void, puts it (into its proper place), and if he is not able to do so single-handed, calls some one else and puts it away with their united effort<A NAME="page_326_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_326_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> without uttering a word on that account,--thus shall we keep Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and not suffer from want of food<A NAME="page_326_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_326_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:5"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>5</FONT>-7. And those Bhikkhus did not speak to or converse with each other. He who came back from the village from his alms-pilgrimage first, prepared seats (&amp;c., as above, &sect; 4, down to) without uttering a word on that account.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:8"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>8</FONT>. Now it is the custom of the Bhikkhus who have finished their Vassa residence, to go to see the Blessed One. Thus those Bhikkhus, when they had finished their Vassa residence and when the three months (of Vassa) had elapsed, set their places of rest in order, took their alms-bowls and robes, and went on their way to S&acirc;vatthi. Wandering from place to place, they came to S&acirc;vatthi, to the <I>G</I>etavana, the garden of An&acirc;thapi<I>nd</I>ika, to the Blessed One; having approached the Blessed One and respectfully saluted him, they sat down near him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:9"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>9</FONT>. Now it is the custom of the blessed Buddhas

<!------------------------page 327------------------------>

<A NAME="page_327"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 327</FONT></A>

to exchange greeting with incoming Bhikkhus. And the Blessed One said to those Bhikkhus: 'Do things go well with you, O Bhikkhus? Do you get enough to support yourselves with? Have you kept Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel? and have you not suffered from want of food?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Things go tolerably well with us, Lord; we get enough, Lord, wherewith to support ourselves; we have kept Vassa well, in unity, in concord, and without quarrel; and have not suffered from want of food.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:10"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>10</FONT>. The Tath&acirc;gatas sometimes ask about what they know; sometimes they do not ask about what they know. They understand the right time when to ask, and they understand the right time when not to ask. The Tath&acirc;gatas put questions full of sense, not void of sense; to what is void of sense the bridge is pulled down for the Tath&acirc;gatas. For two purposes the blessed Buddhas put questions to the Bhikkhus, when they intend to preach the doctrine. or when they intend to institute a rule of conduct to their disciples.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:11"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>11</FONT>. And the Blessed One said to those Bhikkhus: 'In what way, O Bhikkhus, have you kept Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and not suffered from want of food?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We have entered upon Vassa, Lord, a number of Bhikkhus, companions and friends of each other. in a certain district of the Kosala country. Now, Lord, we thought: "What shall we do (&amp;c., as in &sect; 1)?" Then we thought, Lord: "If we do not speak (&amp;c., as in &sect;&sect; 2-4)." Thus, Lord, we did not speak to or converse with each other (&amp;c., down to:) without uttering a word on that account. In that

<!------------------------page 328------------------------>

<A NAME="page_328"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 328</FONT></A>

way, Lord, we have kept Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel; and have not suffered from want of food.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:12"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>12</FONT>. Then the Blessed One thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Indeed, O Bhikkhus, these foolish men who profess to have kept Vassa well, have kept it badly; indeed, O Bhikkhus, these foolish men who profess to have kept Vassa well, have kept it like a herd of cattle; indeed have kept it like a herd of rams; indeed have kept it like a company of indolent people. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, take upon themselves the vow of silence, as the Titthiyas do?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:13"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>13</FONT>. 'This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted (&amp;c., as in Book III, chapter 14, &sect; 3).' And when he bad rebuked them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, take upon himself the vow of silence, as the Titthiyas do. He who does, I commits a dukka<I>t</I>a offence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Bhikkhus, when they have finished their Vassa residence, hold Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; with each other<A NAME="page_328_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_328_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> in these three ways: by what has been seen, or by what has been heard, or by what is suspected. Hence it will result that you live in accord with each other, that you atone for the offences (you have committed), and that you keep the rules of discipline before your eyes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:14"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>14</FONT>. 'And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to hold Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; in this way:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following &ntilde;atti before the Sa<I>m</I>gha: "Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Sirs, hear me.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Then let the senior Bhikkhu adjust his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, sit down squatting, raise his joined hands, and say: "I pronounce my Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc;, friends, before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, by what has been seen, or by what has been heard, or by what is suspected<A NAME="page_329_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_329_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>; may you speak to me, Sirs, out of compassion towards me; if I see (an offence), I will atone for it. And for the second time, &amp;c. And for the third time I pronounce my Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; (&amp;c., down to) if I see (an offence), I will atone for it."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="2:1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. At. that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, while the senior Bhikkhus were crouching down and were performing their Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc;, remained on their seats. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus remain on their seats, while the senior

<A NAME="page_330"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 330</FONT></A>

Bhikkhus crouch down, and perform their Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc;?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those Bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, &amp;c.?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is true, O Lord.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the blessed Buddha rebuked them: 'How can these foolish men, O Bhikkhus, remain on their seats (&amp;c., as above)? This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted (&amp;c., as in chap. 1, &sect; 13).'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having rebuked them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, remain on his seat, while the senior Bhikkhus crouch down, and perform their Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc;. He who does, commits a dukka<I>t</I>a. offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that all of you crouch down while Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; is being performed.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="2:2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. At that time a certain Bhikkhu weak from age, who waited crouching till all had finished their Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc;, fell down fainting.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They told this thing to the Blessed One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that (every Bhikkhu) crouches down the whole while till he has performed his Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc;, and sits down on his seat when he has performed it.'</P>

The alterations to be made are obvious and sufficiently indicated by &sect;&sect; 1-3; instead of, 'Let them proclaim their P&acirc;risuddhi ' (II, 28, 4, &amp;c.), read here, 'Let them pronounce their Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc;.'</P>

<P><A NAME="page_337_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_337_fr_3">3</A> See, for instance, the cases in chap. 17. Buddhaghosa's explanation is different; he says: 'Concord among the Sa<I>m</I>gha js to be understood of such cases as that of Kosamb&icirc;,' It is said in the account of the schism of Kosamb&icirc; that, if concord has been re-established, the reconciled parties hold Uposatha together (X, 5, 14; comp. II, 36, 4); Buddhaghosa apparently extends this to holding Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; also.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_338_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_338_fr_1">1</A> This means apparently that the Bhikkhus were not obliged to pronounce the formula of Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; (chap. 1, 14) thrice, but twice or once respectively.</P>
