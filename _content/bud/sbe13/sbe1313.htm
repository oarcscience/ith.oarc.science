At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt near R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha, on the Gi<I>ggh</I>ak&ucirc;<I>t</I>a mountain ('the Vulture's Peak'). At that time the Paribb&acirc;<I>g</I>akas belonging to Titthiya schools assembled on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of each half month<A NAME="page_239_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_239_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and recited their Dhamma. The people went to them in order to hear the Dhamma. They were filled with favour towards, and were filled with faith in, the Paribb&acirc;<I>g</I>akas belonging to Titthiya schools; the Paribb&acirc;<I>g</I>akas belonging to Titthiya schools gained adherents.</P>

Now when the M&acirc;gadha king Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra was alone, and had retired into solitude, the following consideration presented itself to his mind: 'The Paribb&acirc;<I>g</I>akas belonging to Titthiya schools assemble now on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of each half month and recite their Dhamma.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:3"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT>. Then the M&acirc;gadha king Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat clown near him. Sitting near him the M&acirc;gadha king Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, when I was alone and had retired into solitude, the following consideration presented itself to my mind: "The Paribb&acirc;<I>g</I>akas, &amp;c.; what if the reverend ones were to assemble also on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth clay of each half month." Well, Lord, let the reverend ones assemble also on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth clay of each half month.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:4"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT>. Then the Blessed One taught, incited, animated, and gladdened the M&acirc;gadha king Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra by religious discourse; and the M&acirc;gadha king Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra, having been taught and gladdened by the Blessed One by religious discourse, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, passed round him with his right side towards him, and went away.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you assemble on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth clay of each month.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the Bhikkhus, considering that the Blessed One had ordered them to assemble on the fourteenth &amp;c. day of each half month, assembled on the fourteenth &amp;c. day of each half month and sat there silent. The people went to them in order to hear the Dhamma. They were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<I>n</I>as, when they have assembled on the fourteenth &amp;c. day of each half month, sit there silent, like the dumb, or like hogs? Ought they not to recite the Dhamma, when they have assembled?' Some Bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry; these Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you recite the Dhamma, when you have assembled on the fourteenth &amp;c. day of each half month.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="3:2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>.

Bhikkhus were not allowed to part with their <I>k</I>&icirc;varas, excepting under special circumstances and for a limited time (see the P&acirc;timokkha, 29th nissaggiya dhamma). Conferring the character of ti<I>k</I>&icirc;varena avippav&acirc;sa on a boundary means, we believe, to determine that it should be free to Bhikkhus residing within this boundary, to keep a set of robes wherever they liked within the same boundary (excepting in a village, &sect; 3), and that such an act should not be considered as parting with the robes.</P>

Buddhaghosa also observes at this occasion that the boundaries of the Bhikkhusa<I>m</I>gha and of the Bhikkhun&icirc;sa<I>m</I>gha are quite independent from each other, and that the rules given in chap. 13 do not refer to boundaries the one of which belongs to the Bhikkhusa<I>m</I>gha, the other to the Bhikkhun&icirc;sa<I>m</I>gha.</P>
