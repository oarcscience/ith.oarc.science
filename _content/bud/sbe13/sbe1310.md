<span id="page_59_note_1"></span>[1](#page_59_fr_1) Parima*nd*ala*m*: '
so as to cover the navel-ma*nd*ala, and the knee-ma*nd*ala,' says the
Old Commentary. Compare Childers sub voce Tima*nd*ala*m*; and
*K*ullavagga VIII, 5, 2.

<span id="page_59_note_2"></span>[2](#page_59_fr_2) Antaraghare. The
antaraghara*m* is the space in a village between the huts; not exactly
the same, and yet in the following rules practically the same, as the
village (*g*âma).

<span id="page_59_note_3"></span>[3](#page_59_fr_3) Not, for instance,
with dirty hands or feet, according to the Vibha<u>n</u>ga.

<span id="page_59_note_4"></span>[4](#page_59_fr_4) The practical rule
is for a Bhikkhu to look at a spot in the ground about a plough's length
in front of him.

<span id="footnotes_page_60">p. 60</span>

<span id="page_60_note_1"></span>[1](#page_60_fr_1) Or perhaps 'thrown
off.' He is to be fully dressed as laid down in the 1st and 2nd
Sekhiyas.

<span id="footnotes_page_62">p. 62</span>

<span id="page_62_note_1"></span>[1](#page_62_fr_1) Na ukku*t*ikâya; an
unusual sense of the word; but it is so explained here by the Old
Commentary.

<span id="page_62_note_2"></span>[2](#page_62_fr_2) Na pallatthikâya.
'Without making a rest with his hands, or with a cloth,' according to
the Old Commentary. Compare the Tipallattha-miga *G*âtaka, and No. 65
below.

<span id="page_62_note_3"></span>[3](#page_62_fr_3) Sakka*kk*a*m*.
Sati*m* upa*tth*âpetvâ, says the Samanta-Pâsâdikâ. See also No. 31.

the curry is in quantity one-fourth of the rice' explains the
Samanta-Pâsâdikâ. See No. 34.

'Equally full, equally heaped up (samabhârita*m*) , explains the
Samanta-Pâsâdikâ. Compare the several passages quoted in Rh. D.'s note

<span id="page_63_note_1"></span>[1](#page_63_fr_1) Sapadâna*m*. See
Childers sub voce. The Vibha<u>n</u>ga says, *Kh*abbaggiyâ bhikkhu
taha*m* taha*m* omadditvâ pi*nd*apâta*m* bhu*ñg*anti. The
Samanta-Pâsâdikâ says, Sapadânan ti tattha tattha odhi*m* akatvâ
anupa*t*ipâ*t*iyâ.

<span id="page_63_note_2"></span>[2](#page_63_fr_2) Na thûpato
omadditvâ; on which the Samanta-Pâsâdika has 'matthakato vema*ggh*ato
ti.' He is not to pick and choose what morsel he takes.

<span id="page_63_note_3"></span>[3](#page_63_fr_3) Compare the 8th
Nissaggiya. In the text read upâdâya.

making the sound '*K*apu-*k*apu.'

<span id="footnotes_page_65">p. 65</span>

<span id="page_65_note_1"></span>[1](#page_65_fr_1) Literally, without
making the sound 'Suru-suru.'

here means the space, or small open square in the middle of the house.
