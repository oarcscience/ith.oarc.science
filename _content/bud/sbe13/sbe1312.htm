<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:4"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="2:1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the Bodhi tree to the A<I>g</I>ap&acirc;la banyan tree (banyan tree of the goat-herds<A NAME="page_79_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_79_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>). And when he had reached it, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the A<I>g</I>ap&acirc;la banyan tree uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="2:2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. Now a certain Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, who was of a haughty disposition<A NAME="page_79_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_79_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, he exchanged greeting with the Blessed One; having exchanged with him greeting and complaisant words, he stationed himself near him; then standing near him that Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a thus spoke to the Blessed One: 'By what, Gotama; does one become a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and what are the characteristics that make a man a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="2:3"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT>. And the Blessed One, having heard that, on this occasion pronounced this solemn utterance: 'That Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who has removed (from himself) all sinfulness, who is free from haughtiness, free from impurity, self-restrained, who is an accomplished master of knowledge (or, of the Veda), who has fulfilled the duties of holiness, such a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a may

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="3:1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the A<I>g</I>ap&acirc;la banyan tree to the Mu<I>k</I>alinda tree. And when he had reached it, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the Mu<I>k</I>alinda tree uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="3:2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. At that time a great cloud appeared out of season, rainy weather which lasted seven days, cold weather, storms, and darkness. And the N&acirc;ga (or Serpent) king Mu<I>k</I>alinda came out from his abode, and seven times encircled the body of the Blessed One with his windings, and kept extending his large hood over the Blessed One's head, thinking to himself: 'May no coldness (touch) the Blessed One! May no heat (touch) the Blessed One! May no vexation by gadflies and gnats, by storms and sunheat and reptiles (touch) the Blessed One!'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="3:3"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT>. And at the end of those seven days, when the N&acirc;ga king Mu<I>k</I>alinda saw the open, cloudless sky, he loosened his windings from the body of the Blessed One, made his own appearance disappear, created the appearance of a youth, and stationed himself in front of the Blessed One, raising his clasped hands, and paying reverence to the Blessed One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="3:4"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT>. And the Blessed One, perceiving that, on this occasion, pronounced this solemn utterance: 'Happy is the solitude of him who is full of joy, who has learnt the Truth, who sees (the Truth). Happy is freedom from malice in this world, (self-)restraint towards all beings that have life. Happy is freedom from lust in this world, getting beyond all desires; the putting away of that pride which comes from the thought "I am!" This truly is the highest happiness!'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="4:1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the Mu<I>k</I>alinda tree to the R&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;yatana (tree<A NAME="page_81_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_81_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>); when he had reached it, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;yatana tree uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="4:2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. At that time Tapussa and Bhallika, two merchants, came travelling on the road from Ukkala (Orissa) to that place. Then a deity who had been (in a former life) a blood-relatian of the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, thus spoke to the merchants

<!------------------------page 82------------------------>

<A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A>

Tapussa and Bhallika: 'Here, my noble friends, at the foot of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;yatana tree, is staying the Blessed One, who has just become Sambuddha. Go and show your reverence to him, the Blessed One, by (offering him) rice-cakes and lumps of honey. Long will this be to you for a good and for a blessing.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="4:3"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT>. And the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika took rice-cakes and lumps of honey, and went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, they stationed themselves near him; standing near him, the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika thus addressed the Blessed One: 'May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept from us these rice-cakes and lumps of honey, that that may long be to us for a good and for a blessing! </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="4:4"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT>. Then the Blessed One thought: 'The Tath&acirc;gatas<A NAME="page_82_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_82_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> do not accept (food) with their hands. Now

<!------------------------page 83------------------------>

<A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A>

with what shall I accept the rice-cakes and lumps of honey?' Then the four Mah&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>a gods<A NAME="page_83_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_83_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>, understanding by the power of their minds the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the Blessed One, offered to the Blessed One from the four quarters (of the horizon) four bowls made of stone (saying), 'May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept herewith the rice-cakes and the lumps of honey!' The Blessed One accepted those new stone bowls; and therein be received the rice-cakes and honey lumps, and those, when he had received, he ate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="4:5"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>5</FONT>. And Tapussa and Bhallika, the merchants, when they saw that the Blessed One had cleansed<A NAME="page_83_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_83_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> his bowl and his hands, bowed down in reverence

at the feet of the Blessed One and thus addressed the Blessed One: 'We take our refuge, Lord, in the Blessed One and in the Dhamma; may the Blessed One receive us as disciples who, from this day forth while our life lasts, have taken their refuge (in him).' These were the first in the world to become lay-disciples (of the Buddha) by the formula which contained (only) the dyad<A NAME="page_84_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_84_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;yatana tree to the A<I>g</I>ap&acirc;la banyan tree. And when he had reached it, the Blessed One stayed there at the foot of the A<I>g</I>ap&acirc;la banyan tree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. Then in the mind of the Blessed One, who was alone, and had retired into solitude, the following thought arose: 'I have penetrated this doctrine which is profound, difficult to perceive and to understand, which brings quietude of heart, which is exalted, which is unattainable by reasoning, abstruse, intelligible (only) to the wise. This people, on the other hand, is given to desire, intent upon desire, delighting in desire. To this people, therefore, who

<!------------------------page 85------------------------>

<A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A>

are given to desire, intent upon desire, delighting in desire, the law of causality and the chain of causation will be a matter difficult to understand; most difficult for them to understand will be also the extinction of all sa<I>m</I>kh&acirc;ras, the getting rid of all the substrata (of existence<A NAME="page_85_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_85_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>), the destruction of desire, the absence of passion, quietude of heart, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a! Now if I proclaim the doctrine, and other men are not able to understand my preaching, there would result but weariness and annoyance to me.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:3"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT>. And then the following . . . .<A NAME="page_85_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_85_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> stanzas, unheard before, occurred to the Blessed One: 'With great pains have I acquired it. Enough! why should I now proclaim it? This doctrine will not be easy to understand to beings that are lost in lust and hatred.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Given to lust, surrounded with thick darkness, they will not see what is repugnant (to their minds), abstruse, profound, difficult to perceive, and subtle.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:4"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT>. When the Blessed One pondered over this matter, his mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not to preach the doctrine. Then Brahm&acirc;

<!------------------------page 86------------------------>

<A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A>

Sahampati<A NAME="page_86_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_86_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>, understanding by the power of his mind the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the Blessed One, thought: 'Alas! the world perishes! Alas! the world is destroyed! if the mind of the Tath&acirc;gata, of the holy, of the absolute Sambuddha inclines itself to remain in quiet, and not to preach the doctrine.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:5"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>5</FONT>. Then Brahm&acirc; Sahampati disappeared from Brahma's world, and appeared before the Blessed One (as quickly) as a strong man might stretch his bent arm out, or draw back his out-stretched arm.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:6"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>6</FONT>. And Brahm&acirc; Sahampati adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, and putting his right knee on the ground, raised his joined hands towards the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine! may the perfect One preach the doctrine! there are beings whose mental eyes are darkened by scarcely any dust; but if they do not hear the doctrine, they cannot attain salvation. These will understand the doctrine.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:7"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>7</FONT>. Thus spoke Brahm&acirc; Sahampati; and when he had thus spoken, he further said: 'The Dhamma hitherto manifested in the country of Magadha has been impure, thought out by contaminated men. But do thou now open the door of the Immortal<A NAME="page_86_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_86_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>; let them hear the doctrine discovered by the spotless One!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As a man standing on a rock, on mountain's

top, might overlook the people all around, thus, O wise One, ascending to the highest palace of Truth, look down, all-seeing One, upon the people lost in suffering, overcome by birth and decay,--thou, who hast freed thyself from suffering!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Arise, O hero; O victorious One! Wander through the world, O leader of the pilgrim band, who thyself art free from debt. May the Blessed One preach the doctrine; there will be people who can understand it!'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:8"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>8</FONT>. When he had spoken thus, the Blessed One said to Brahm&acirc; Sahampati: 'The following thought, Brahm&acirc;, has occurred to me: "I have penetrated this doctrine, . . . . (&amp;c., down to end of &sect; 2)." And also, Brahm&acirc;, the following . . . .<A NAME="page_87_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_87_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> stanzas have presented themselves to my mind, which had not been heard (by me) before: "With great pains, . . . . (&amp;c., down to end of &sect; 3)." When I pondered over this matter, Brahm&acirc;, my mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not to preach the doctrine.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:9"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>9</FONT>. And a second time Brahm&acirc; Sahampati said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine, . . . . (&amp;c., as in &sect;&sect; 6, 7).' And for the second time the Blessed One said to Brahm&acirc; Sahampati: 'The following thought . . . . (&amp;c., as before).'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:10"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>10</FONT>. And a third time Brahm&acirc; Sahampati said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine, . . . . (&amp;c., as before).'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Blessed One, when he had heard Brahm&acirc;'s solicitation, looked, full of compassion towards sentient beings, over the world, with his (all-perceiving) eye of a Buddha. And the Blessed One, looking over the world with his eye of a Buddha,

<!------------------------page 88------------------------>

<A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A>

saw beings whose mental eyes were darkened by scarcely any dust, and beings whose eyes were covered by much dust, beings sharp of sense and blunt of sense, of good disposition and of bad disposition, easy to instruct and difficult to instruct, some of them seeing the dangers of future life and of sin.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:11"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>11</FONT>. As, in a pond of blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, some blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, do not emerge over the water, but thrive hidden under the water; and other blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, reach to the surface of the water; and other blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, stand emerging out of the water, and the water does not touch them,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:12"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>12</FONT>. Thus the Blessed One, looking over the world with his eye of a Buddha, saw beings whose mental eyes were darkened, . . . . (&amp;c., the text repeats &sect; 10); and when he had thus seen them, he addressed Brahm&acirc; Sahampati in the following stanza: 'Wide opened is the door of the Immortal to all who have ears to hear; let them send forth faith to meet it. The Dhamma sweet and good I spake not, Brahm&acirc;, despairing of the weary task, to men.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:13"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>13</FONT>. Then Brahm&acirc; Sahampati understood: 'The Blessed One grants my request that He should preach the doctrine.' And he bowed down before the Blessed One, and passed round him with his right side towards him; and then he straightway disappeared.</P>

Now Upaka, a man belonging to the &Acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;vaka sect (i.e. the sect of naked ascetics), saw the Blessed One travelling on the road, between Gay&acirc; and the Bodhi tree; and when he saw him, he said to the Blessed One: 'Your countenance, friend, is serene; your complexion is pure and bright.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="6:8"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>8</FONT>. When Upaka the &Acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;vaka had spoken thus, the Blessed One addressed him in the following stanzas: 'I have overcome all foes; I am all-wise; I am free from stains in every way; I have left everything; and have obtained emancipation by the destruction of desire. Having myself gained knowledge, whom should I call my master? I have no teacher; no one is equal to me; in the world of men and of gods no being is like me. I am the holy One in this world, I am the highest teacher, I alone am the absolute Sambuddha; I have gained coolness (by the extinction of all passion) and have obtained Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Buddha said): 'Like me are all <I>G</I>inas who have reached extinction of the &Acirc;savas<A NAME="page_91_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_91_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>; I have overcome (<I>g</I>it&acirc; me) all states of sinfulness; therefore, Upaka, am I the <I>G</I>ina.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had spoken thus, Upaka the &Acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;vaka replied: 'It may be so, friend;' shook his head, took another road, and went away.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="6:10"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>10</FONT>. And the Blessed One, wandering from place to place, came to Benares, to the deer park Isipatana, to the place where the five Bhikkhus were. And

 the five Bhikkhus saw the Blessed One coming from afar; when they saw him, they concerted with each other, saying, 'Friends, there comes the sama<I>n</I>a Gotama, who lives in abundance, who has given up his exertions, and who has turned to an abundant life.

And the Blessed One saw Yasa, the noble youth, coming from afar. And when he saw him, he left the place where he was walking, and sat down on a seat laid out (for him). And Yasa, the noble youth, gave utterance near the Blessed One to that solemn exclamation: 'Alas! what distress; alas! what danger!' And the Blessed One said to Yasa, the noble youth: 'Here is no distress, Yasa, here is no danger. Come here, Yasa, sit down; I will teach you the Truth (Dhamma).'</P>

When Yasa, the noble youth, was sitting near him, the Blessed One preached to him in due course: that is to say, he talked about the merits obtained by alms-giving, about the duties of morality, about heaven, about the evils, the vanity, and the sinfulness of desires, and about the blessings of the abandonment of desire<A NAME="page_104_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_104_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>.</P>

the Cause of stiffering, the Cessation of suffering, the Path. Just as a clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye, thus Yasa, the noble youth, even while sitting there, obtained the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth (that is, the knowledge): 'Whatsoever is subject to the condition of origination is subject also to the condition of cessation.'</P>

Then the se<I>tth</I>i, the householder, sent messengers on horseback to the four quarters of the horizon; and he went himself to the deer park Isipatana.

And the se<I>tth</I>i, the householder, having seen the Truth, having mastered the Truth, having penetrated the Truth, having overcome uncertainty, having dispelled all doubts, having gained full knowledge, dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the doctrine of the Teacher, said to the Blessed One: 'Glorious, Lord! glorious, Lord! Just as if one should set up, Lord, what had been overturned, or should reveal what had been hidden, or should point out the way to one who had lost his way, or should bring a lamp into the darkness, in order that those who had eyes might see visible things, thus has the Blessed One preached the doctrine in many ways.

released from the &Acirc;savas. Then the Blessed One thought: 'Yasa, the noble youth, while instruction was administered to his father, has contemplated the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood; and his mind has become free from attachment to the world, and has become released from the &Acirc;savas. It is impossible that Yasa, the noble youth, should return to the world and enjoy pleasures, as he did before, when he lived in his house.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="7:12"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>12</FONT>. Then the se<I>tth</I>i, the householder, saw Yasa, the noble youth, sitting there. On seeing him he said to Yasa, the noble youth: 'My son Yasa, your mother is absorbed in lamentation and grief; restore your mother to life.'</P>

Or that rather he was contemplating the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood; and that his mind has thus become free from attachment to the world, and has become released from the &Acirc;savas? Now would it then be possible, O householder, that Yasa should return to the world and enjoy pleasures as he did before, when he lived in his house?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Not so, Lord.'

'Yasa, the noble youth, O householder, had (first) won, like yourself, an imperfect degree of knowledge and insight into the Truth.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent.

the Blessed One thought: 'What if I were to cause the water to recede round about, and if I were to walk up and down in the midst of the water on a dust-covered spot.' And the Blessed One caused the water to recede round about, and he walked up and down in the midst of the water on a dust-covered spot.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the <I>G</I>a<I>t</I>ila Uruvel&acirc; Kassapa, who was afraid that the water might have carried away the great Sama<I>n</I>a, went with a boat together with many <I>G</I>a<I>t</I>ilas to the place where the Blessed One lived. Then the <I>G</I>a<I>t</I>ila Uruvel&acirc; Kassapa saw the Blessed One, who had caused the water to recede round about, walking up and down in the midst of the water on a dust-covered spot.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Here I am, Kassapa,' replied the Blessed One, and he rose in the air and stationed himself in the boat.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the <I>G</I>a<I>t</I>ila Uruvel&acirc; Kassapa thought: 'Truly the great Sama<I>n</I>a possesses high magical powers and great faculties, since the water does not carry him away. He is not, however, holy like me.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="20:17"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>17</FONT>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, who understood in his mind the reflection which had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of Magadha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and householders, addressed the venerable Uruvel&acirc; Kassapa

in this stanza: 'What knowledge have you gained, O inhabitant of Uruvel&acirc;, that has induced you, who were renowned for your penances<A NAME="page_138_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_138_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>, to forsake your sacred fire?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Kassapa replied): 'It is visible things and sounds, and also tastes, pleasures and woman that the sacrifices speak of<A NAME="page_138_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_138_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>; because I understood that whatever belongs to existence<A NAME="page_138_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_138_note_3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A> is filth, therefore I took no more delight in sacrifices and offerings<A NAME="page_138_fr_4"></A><A HREF="#page_138_note_4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A>.'</P>

How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, go on their rounds, &amp;c.? How can they make so great and loud a noise in the dining halls?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venerable &Acirc;nanda accepted this order of the Blessed One (by saying), 'Yes, Lord,' took a key, and said to the Bhikkhus in every cell: 'Friends, the Blessed One,' &amp;c.</P>

</P>

<P><A NAME="page_73_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_73_fr_1">1</A> To this book is prefixed, as introduction, an account of the first events after Gotama's attaining Buddhahood, down to the conversion of his two chief disciples, S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na (chaps. 1-24). Among the elements of historical or legendary character with which, in the Vinaya Pi<I>t</I>aka, the discussion of the monastic discipline is interwoven, this account occupies by far the first place, both in extent and in importance. For it contains the oldest version accessible to us now and, most probably, for ever, of what the Buddhist fraternity deemed to be the history of their Master's life in its most important period.</P>

<P>The connection in which this legendary narration stands with the main subject of the first Khandhaka is not difficult to account for. The regulations regarding the admission to the fraternity, which are discussed in this Khandhaka, could not but present themselves to the redactors of the Pi<I>t</I>aka as being the very basis of their religious discipline and monastic life. It was possible to fancy the existence of the Sa<I>m</I>gha without the P&acirc;timokkha rules, or without the regulations about the Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; festival, but it was impossible to realise the idea of a Sa<I>m</I>gha without rules showing who was to be regarded as a duly admitted member of the fraternity, and who was not. It is quite natural, therefore, that the stories or legends concerning the ordination of Bhikkhus were put in connection with the record of the very first events of the history of the Sa<I>m</I>gha. Nor is it difficult to account for the theory formulated by the historians of the Buddhist ecclesiastical law, of different successive forms in which the ordination of Bhikkhus had been performed. In the beginning, of course, there was nobody but the Buddha himself who could ordain Bhikkhus; to him those who desired to be received, expressed their wish, and he conferred on them the pabba<I>gg</I>&acirc; and upasampad&acirc; ordinations by the formula: 'Ehi bhikkhu,' &amp;c. (see I, 6, 32, 34, &amp;c.) It was a very natural conception that afterwards, as the Sa<I>m</I>gha grew larger, the Buddha should have transferred the power of admitting new members to the Bhikkhus themselves, and should have instituted that form of ordination which the redactors of the Pi<I>t</I>aka found valid at their own time.</P>

<P>The transition, however, from the supposed oldest form of ordination (the so-called ehi-bhikkhu-upasampad&acirc;) to that latter form is in the Vinaya legends not represented as immediate. There is described an intermediate stage between the two, the ordination by the three sara<I>n</I>agamanas, or by the candidate's three times repeated declaration of his taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sa<I>m</I>gha (see Mah&acirc;vagga I, 12). The reason which has led the redactors of the Vinaya Pi<I>t</I>aka to this construction, was most probably the important part which in the upasampad&acirc; service of the later time devolved upon the preceptor (upa<I>ggh</I>&acirc;ya) of the candidate. As only learned Bhikkhus, who had completed the tenth year after their own upasampad&acirc;, could perform the function of upa<I>ggh</I>&acirc;ya at the upasampad&acirc; ordination of other Bhikkhus (Mah&acirc;vagga I, 31, 8), it was natural that the redactors of the Vinaya found it impossible to ascribe this form of upasampad&acirc; service to the first times of Buddha's teaching. For these times, therefore, they recorded another form, the upasampad&acirc; by the three sara<I>n</I>agamanas, the introduction of which they assigned, very naturally, to the time soon after the conversion of Yasa's friends, by which event the number of Bhikkhus had been augmented at once from seven to sixty-one.</P>

The Mah&acirc;vagga, which contains these legends in their oldest forms, assigns to this stay a period of four times seven days; the later tradition is unanimous in extending it to seven times seven days (Buddhaghosa in the commentary on the Mah&acirc;vagga; <I>G</I>&acirc;taka Atthav. vol. i. p. 77 seq.; D&icirc;pava<I>m</I>sa I, 29, 30; Lalita Vistara, p. 488 seq.; Beal, Romantic Legend, p. 236 seq., &amp;c.)</P>

<P><A NAME="page_75_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_75_fr_1">1</A> The Chain of Causation, or the doctrine of the twelve nid&acirc;nas (causes of existence), contains, as has often been observed, in a more developed form an answer to the same problem to which the second and third of the four Noble Truths (ariyasa<I>kk</I>a) also try to give a solution, viz. the problem of the origin and destruction of suffering. The Noble Truths simply reduce the origin of suffering to Thirst, or Desire (Ta<I>n</I>h&acirc;), in its threefold form, thirst for pleasure, thirst for existence, thirst for prosperity (see I, 6, 20). In the system of the twelve nid&acirc;nas Thirst also has found its place among the causes of suffering, but it is not considered as the immediate cause. A concatenation of other categories is inserted between to<I>n</I>h&acirc; and its ultimate effect; and on the other hand, the investigation of causes is carried on further beyond to<I>n</I>h&acirc;. The question is here asked, What does to<I>n</I>h&acirc; come from? and thus the series of causes and effects is led back to avigg&acirc; (Ignorance), as its deepest root. We may add that the redactors of the Pi<I>t</I>akas, who of course could not but observe this parallelity between the second and third ariyasa<I>kk</I>as and the system of the twelve nid&acirc;nas, go so far, in one instance (A<U>n</U>guttara-Nik&acirc;ya, Tika-Nip&acirc;ta, fol. <I>k</I>e of the Phayre MS.), as to directly replace, in giving the text of the four ariyasa<I>kk</I>as, the second and third of them by the twelve nid&acirc;nas, in direct and reverse order respectively. Professor Childers has furnished a valuable note on the nid&acirc;nas; see Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays (second edition), II, 453 seq.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_75_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_75_fr_2">2</A> In the Samm&acirc;di<I>tth</I>isuttanta (Ma<I>ggh</I>ima-Nik&acirc;ya, fol. kh&ucirc; of Turnour's MS.) we find the following explanation of what Ignorance is: 'Not to know Suffering, not to know the Cause of suffering, not to know the Cessation of suffering, not to know the Path which leads to the cessation of suffering, this is called Ignorance.' The same is repeated in the explanation of the nid&acirc;na formula, which is given in the Vibha<U>n</U>ga (Abhidhamma-Pi<I>t</I>aka, Pa<I>t</I>i<I>kk</I>asamupp&acirc;da-vibha<U>n</U>ga, fol. <I>k</I>i of the Phayre MS.), and we must accept it, therefore, as the authentic expression of Buddhistical belief. It is obvious, however, that this explanation leaves room for another question. Ignorance, we are told, is the source of all evil and of all suffering, and the subject ignored is stated to be the four Truths. But who is the subject that ignores them? All attributes (as the vi<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>a, &amp;c.), that constitute sentient beings and enable them to know or to ignore, are said to be first produced by Ignorance, and we shou1d conclude, therefore, that they cannot exist before Ignorance has begun to act. Or are we to understand that it is the Ignorance incurred by a sentient being in a preceding existence, that causes the sa<I>m</I>kh&acirc;ras and Consciousness, the connecting links between the different existences, to act and to bring about the birth of a new being?</P>

<P>As is well known, this Ignorance (Avidy&acirc;) plays a great part also in the Brahmanical philosophy of the Upanishads; and the Buddhist belief is, no doubt, founded to a considerable extent on older theories. But we cannot venture in a note to touch upon one of the most difficult and interesting questions which await the research of Indianists.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_82_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_82_fr_1">1</A> The term Tath&acirc;gata is, in the Buddhistical literature, exclusively applied to Samm&acirc;sambuddhas, and it is more especially used in the Pi<I>t</I>akas when the Buddha is represented as speaking of himself in the third person as 'the Tath&acirc;gata.' The meaning 'sentient being,' which is given to the word in the Abhidh&acirc;nappad&icirc;pik&acirc;, and in Childers's Dictionary, is not confirmed, as far as we know, by any passage of the Pi<I>t</I>akas. This translation of the word is very possibly based merely on a misunderstanding of the phrase often repeated in the Sutta Pi<I>t</I>aka: hoti tath&acirc;gato para<I>m</I> mara<I>n</I>&acirc;, which means, of course, 'does a Buddha exist after death?' In the <I>G</I>aina books we sometimes find the term tatthagaya (tatragata), 'he who has attained that world, i.e. emancipation,' applied to the <I>G</I>inas as opposed to other beings who are called ihagaya (idhagata), 'living in this world.' See, for instance, the <I>G</I>ina<I>k</I>aritra, &sect; 16. Considering the close relation in which most of the dogmatical terms of the <I>G</I>ainas stand to those of the Bauddhas, it is difficult to believe that tath&acirc;gata and tatthagaya should not originally have conveyed very similar ideas. We think that on the long way from the original M&acirc;gadh&icirc; to the P&acirc;li and Sanskrit, the term tatthagata or tatth&acirc;gata (tatra + &acirc;gata), 'he who has arrived there, i.e. at emancipation,' may very easily have undergone the change into tath&acirc;gata, which would have made it unintelligible, were we not able to compare its unaltered form as preserved by the <I>G</I>ainas.</P>

On&icirc;ta, i.e. avanita, is not apan&icirc;ta, and the end of the dinner was marked, not by the Bhikkhu's removing his hand from the bowl, but by his washing the bowl (see <I>K</I>ullavagga VIII, 4, 6), and, of course, his hands.

The description of their ascetic life given in many passages of the <I>G</I>&acirc;taka Atthava<I>nn</I>an&acirc; and of the Apad&acirc;na exactly agrees with the picture of the forest life of the {Greek: <I>ul&oacute;bioi</I>} which so frequently occurs in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata. In the Mah&acirc;vagga (VI, 35, 2) it is expressly stated that the <I>G</I>a<I>t</I>ilas recognised the authority of the Veda, and it is in keeping with this that the usual term for adopting the state of a <I>G</I>a<I>t</I>ila is 'isipabba<I>gg</I>am pabba<I>g</I>ati' (frequently in the <I>G</I>&acirc;t.

The name Upatissa occurs in Asoka's well-known edict which has been found at Bair&acirc;t. The king there quotes 'The Question of Upatissa' among the texts, the study of which he recommends to the brethren and sisters of the fraternity and to the laymen of either sex.

It is very difficult or rather impossible to draw a sharp line of distinction between &acirc;<I>k</I>ariy&acirc; and upa<I>ggh</I>&acirc;ya. The duties of an &acirc;<I>k</I>ariya towards his antev&acirc;sika, and of an antev&acirc;sika towards his &acirc;<I>k</I>ariya, as indicated in chaps. 32, 33 ( = <I>K</I>ullavagga VIII, 13, 14), are exactly the same as those of an upa<I>ggh</I>&acirc;ya towards his saddhivih&acirc;rika and vice versa (chaps. 25, 26 = <I>K</I>ullavagga VIII, 11, 12). The position of an upa<I>ggh</I>&acirc;ya, however, was considered as the more important of the two; at the upasampad&acirc; service the upa<I>ggh</I>&acirc;ya had a more prominent part than the &acirc;<I>k</I>ariya, as we may infer from chaps. 28, 29, and from the explanations on the 65th p&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya rule which are given in the Sutta Vibha<U>n</U>ga. There it is said that, if the upasampad&acirc; ordination had been conferred, against the rule, on a person that has not yet attained his twentieth year, the upa<I>ggh</I>&acirc;ya has made himself guilty of a p&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya offence, the &acirc;<I>k</I>ariya and the other present Bhikkhus only of a dukka<I>t</I>a offence. We may add that the succession of Vinaya teachers from Up&acirc;li down to Mahinda, which is given in the D&icirc;pava<I>m</I>sa (Bh&acirc;<I>n</I>av&acirc;ras IV and V), is a succession of upa<I>ggh</I>&acirc;yas and saddhivih&acirc;rikas (see IV, 36, 42, 43, &amp;c.), not of &acirc;<I>k</I>ariyas and antev&acirc;sikas; the duty of instructing the young Bhikkhus in the holy doctrines and ordinances seems, therefore, to belong to the upa<I>ggh</I>&acirc;ya rather than to the &acirc;<I>k</I>ariya; compare also D&icirc;pava<I>m</I>sa VII, 26. So among the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, on the contrary, the &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya is estimated higher than the up&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya; see Manu II, 145; Y&acirc;<I>g&ntilde;</I>avalkya I, 35.

Generally in the Khandhakas, which presuppose, as we have stated in our preface, the existence of the P&acirc;timokkha, direct repetition of the rules laid down there has been avoided. If, nevertheless, in the Khandhakas a transgression alluded to in the P&acirc;timokkha had to be mentioned again, then in most cases the Khandhakas, instead of directly indicating the penance incurred thereby, use of the guilty Bhikkhu the expression, 'yath&acirc;dhammo k&acirc;retabbo,' i.e. 'he is to be treated according to the law.' See H. O.'s Introduction to his edition of the Mah&acirc;vagga, p. xx note.</P>
