<P><A NAME="page_41_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_41_fr_1">1</A> These are the various non-Buddhist religious teachers or devotees, most of whom rejected the Vedas. The Paribb&acirc;<I>g</I>akas were mostly, though not always, wandering logicians, willing to maintain theses against all the world. Paribb&acirc;<I>g</I>ik&acirc; is merely the feminine of the last. A<I>k</I>elaka, which naturally has no feminine, were the naked ascetics.</P>

<P>The sect now called <I>G</I>ains are divided into two classes, Svetambaras and Digambaras, the latter of which eat naked. They are known to be the successors of the school called Niga<I>nth</I>as in the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas; and it is not certain whether the Niga<I>nth</I>as are included in the A<I>k</I>elakas. It is probable that the Br&acirc;hman ascetics, the V&acirc;naprasthas, were not included under the term Paribb&acirc;<I>g</I>akas; but our information on the exact meaning of these terms is, as yet, very imperfect.</P>

Then the Samanta-P&acirc;s&acirc;dik&acirc;, doubtless to justify this suggested implication, makes sabhogana<I>m</I> equal to saha ubhohi <I>g</I>anehi (!); or, in the alternative, to sabhoga<I>m</I>, since 'the wife is the bhoga of a man still given to passion, and the husband the bhoga of a wife.' The use of Bho<I>g</I>ana in any such sense is extremely forced, and was perhaps only suggested by the following rules; but it is just possible we should translate, 'a household still given to pleasure' (compare <I>K</I>ullavagga VIII, 5, 1), or 'fond of good food' (compare Milinda Pa&ntilde;ha 76).</P>

The people delayed giving his meal to the other Bhikkhu till Upananda should arrive. He came late; and the other Bhikkhu was thereby discomforted.</P>

<P>The family devoted to Upananda sent him food for his use; saying it was to be given to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, with special reference to him. He had gone for an alms to the village. The messengers delivered the food and the message, and asked where Upananda was. The Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One. He directed the present to be accepted, and laid by till Upananda should return. After Upananda returned, he nevertheless went out again to attend on other families, and the food so sent went bad.</P>

<P>The Bhikkhu is to tell a resident Bhikkhu before, on account of this rule, giving up his usual rounds, in order that he may still go if a sick Bhikkhu wants medicine.</P>

The Old Commentary says, 'by providing him with chunam, or clay, or a tooth-cleanser, or water to wash his face with.' No doubt upa<I>tth</I>&acirc;pet&icirc; is used in the sense of showing such personal attentions to another, as the upa<I>tth</I>&acirc;k&acirc; did to the Buddha; and such services would very rightly come under this rule. Yet here, as often, the comment is rather a scholastic exegesis of the sentence, than a philologically exact explanation of the word.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_52_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_52_fr_2">2</A> Indakh&icirc;la, the word translated 'threshold,' is explained in the Old Commentary by sayani-ghara, 'sleeping chamber;' but this is rather a didactic gloss on the rule. Compare the note above on the 43rd P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya. The phrase 'when the queen has not gone in' is somewhat doubtful. H. O.'s MS. of the Vibha<U>n</U>ga reads (as Minayeff does) aniggata-ratanake, instead of Dickson's an&icirc;hata-ratanake. The former is the better reading; n&icirc;hata is impossible, it must be either nihata or n&icirc;ha<I>t</I>a. But ratanaka, though the queen is one of the seven Ratanas of a king, is not found elsewhere used absolutely for a queen: the use of r&acirc;<I>g</I>ake, too, immediately after ra<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>o, instead of ra<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>e or r&acirc;<I>g</I>ini, is curious. A possible alternative rendering would be 'when the court has not departed, and the regalia not laid aside:' but we prefer on the whole the Old Commentator's explanation of r&acirc;.gaka and ratanaka.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_54_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_54_fr_3">3</A> On the doubtful meaning of Sugata, see the note above on the 28th Nissaggiya. There is no reason whatever to believe that Gotama's robe was larger, in proportion, than those worn by the other members of his order. He exchanged robes with Mah&acirc; Kassapa. Of the two sets of robes brought by Pukkusa, one was given to &Acirc;nanda, and one was reserved for the Buddha himself; and no one can read the account in the Mah&acirc;-parinibb&acirc;na Sutta without feeling that both are supposed to be of the same size.</P>
