At that time the retreat during the rainy season had not yet been instituted by the Blessed One for the Bhikkhus. Thus the Bhikkhus went on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<I>n</I>as go on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="1:3"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT>. Now some Bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you enter upon Vassa<A NAME="page_299_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_299_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They told this thing to the Blessed One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are two periods, O Bhikkhus, for entering upon Vassa, the earlier and the later. The earlier time for entering (upon Vassa) is the day after the

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="3:1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. At that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, having entered upon Vassa, went on their travels during the period of Vassa.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, who has entered upon Vassa, go on his travels before he has kept Vassa during the earlier or during the later three months. He who does so, commits a dukka<I>t</I>a offence.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. And the Blessed One, after having resided at R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha as long as he thought fit, went forth to S&acirc;vatthi. Wandering from place to place he came to S&acirc;vatthi. There, at S&acirc;vatthi, the Blessed One dwelt in the <I>G</I>etavana, the garden of An&acirc;thapi<I>nd</I>ika.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time an up&acirc;saka (lay devotee) named Udena, in the Kosala country, had a Vih&acirc;ra built for the Sa<I>m</I>gha. He sent a messenger to the Bhikkhus (saying), 'Might their reverences come hither; I desire to bestow gifts (on the Sa<I>m</I>gha) and to hear the Dhamma and to see the Bhikkhus.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. The Bhikkhus replied: 'The Blessed One has prescribed, friend, that no one who has entered upon Vassa, may go on a journey before he has kept Vassa during the earlier or during the later three months. Let the up&acirc;saka Udena wait so long as the Bhikkhus keep their Vassa residence; when they have finished Vassa, they will go. But if there is any urgent necessity, let him dedicate the Vih&acirc;ra in presence of the Bhikkhus who reside there.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="5:3"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT>. The up&acirc;saka Udena was annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can their reverences, when I send for them, refuse to come? I am a giver and a doer (of good works), and do service to the fraternity.' Some Bhikkhus heard the up&acirc;saka Udena, who was annoyed, &amp;c.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.</P>

When he was going to the district (where he had consented to go to), he saw on his way two districts in which there were plenty of robes, and he thought: 'What if I were to keep Vassa in these two districts; thus shall I obtain many robes.' And he kept Vassa in those two districts. King Pasenadi of Kosala was annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can the noble, Upananda Sakyaputta, after he has promised us to take up his Vassa residence (with us), break his word? Has not falsehood been reproved, and abstinence from falsehood been praised by the Blessed One in many ways?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consequence of that, the Blessed One, after having ordered the fraternity of Bhikkhus to assemble, asked the venerable Upananda Sakyaputta: 'Is it true, Upananda, that you have broken your word, having promised to king Pasenadi of Kosala to take up your Vassa residence (with him)?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is true, Lord?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the blessed Buddha rebuked him: 'How can you, O foolish one, break your word, having promised, &amp;c.? Has not falsehood, O foolish one, been reproved, and abstinence from falsehood been praised by me in many ways? This will not do, O foolish one, for converting the unconverted, and for augmenting the number of the converted, but it will result, O foolish one, in the unconverted being repulsed (from the faith) and many of the converted being estranged.'</P>
