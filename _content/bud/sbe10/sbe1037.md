## 1. VATTHUGÂTHÂ.

> To the Brâhma*n*a Bâvarî, living on the banks of the Godhâvarî, in
> Assaka's territory, comes another Brâhma*n*a and asks for five hundred
> pieces of money, but not getting them he curses Bâvarî, saying, 'May
> thy head on the seventh day hence cleave into seven.' A deity comforts
> Bâvarî by referring him to Buddha. Then Bâvarî sends his sixteen
> disciples to Buddha, and each of thern asks Buddha a question.

   1. From the beautiful city of the Kosalas (Sâvatthî) a Brâhma*n*a,
well versed in the hymns, went to the South (Dakkhi*n*âpatha) wishing
for nothingness<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (976)

   2. In Assaka's territory, in the neighbourhood of A*l*aka, he dwelt
on the banks of the Godhâvarî, (living) on gleanings and fruit. (977)

   3. And close by the bank there was a large village, with the income
of which he prepared a great sacrifice. (978)

   4. Having offered the great sacrifice, he again entered the
hermitage. Upon his re-entering, another Brâhma*n*a arrived, (979)

   5. With swollen feet<sup>\[2\]</sup>, trembling, covered with mud,
with dust on his head. And he going up

   to him (i.e. the first Brâhma*n*a) demanded five hundred (pieces of
money). (980)

   6. Bâvarî, seeing him, bade him be seated, asked him whether he was
happy and well, and spoke as follows: (981)

   7. 'What gifts I had are all given away by me; pardon me, O
Brâhma*n*a, I have no five hundred.' (982)

   8. 'If thou wilt not give to me who asks, may thy head on the seventh
clay cleave into seven.' (983)

   9. So after the usual ceremonies this impostor made known his fearful
(curse). On hearing these his words Bâvarî became sorrowful. (984)

   10. He wasted away taking no food, transfixed by the arrow of grief,
but yet his mind delighted in meditation. (985)

   11. Seeing Bâvarî struck with horror and sorrowful, the benevolent
deity (of that place) approached him and said as follows: (986)

   12. 'He does not know (anything about) the head; he is a hypocrite
coveting riches; knowledge of the head and head-splitting is not found
in him<sup>\[1\]</sup>.' (987)

   13. 'If the venerable (deity) knows it, then tell me, when asked, all
about the head and head-splitting; let us hear thy words.' (988)

   14. 'I do not know this; knowledge of it is not found in me; as to
the head and head-splitting, this is to be seen by Buddhas (only).'
(989)

   15. 'Who then, say, in the circumference of the

\[1. Na so muddha*m* pa*g*ânâti,  
     Kuhako so dhanatthiko,  
     Muddhani muddhapâte *k*a  
     *Ñ*â*n*a*m* tassa na vi*gg*ati.\]

p. 186

earth knows the head and head-splitting, tell me that, O deity?' (990)

   16. 'Formerly went out from Kapilavatthu a ruler of the world, an
offspring of the Okkâka king, the Sakya son, the light-giving; (991)

   17. 'He is, O Brâhma*n*a, the perfectly Enlightened (Sambuddha);
perfect in all things, he has attained the power of all knowledge, sees
clearly in everything; he has arrived at the destruction of all things,
and is liberated in the destruction of the upadhis<sup>\[1\]</sup>.
(992)

   18. 'He is Buddha, he is Bhagavat in the world, he, the
clearly-seeing, teaches the Dhamma; go thou to him and ask, he will
explain it to thee.' (993)

   19. Having heard the word 'Sambuddha,' Bâvarî rejoiced, his grief
became little, and he was filled with great delight. (994)

   20. Bâvarî glad, rejoicing, and eager asked the deity: 'In what
village or in what town or in what province dwells the chief of the
world, that going there we may adore the perfectly Enlightened, the
first of men?' (995)

   21. 'In Sâvatthî, the town of the Kosalas, dwells *G*ina (the
Victorious), of great understanding and excellent wide knowledge, he the
Sakya son, unyoked, free from passion, skilled in head-splitting, the
bull of men.' (996)

   22. Then (Bâvarî) addressed his disciples, Brâhma*n*as, perfect in
the hymns: 'Come, youths, I will tell (you something), listen to my
words: (997)

   23. 'He whose appearance in the world is difficult to be met with
often, he is at the present time

\[1. Sabbadhammakkhaya*m* patto (i.e. nibbâna)  
     Vimutto upadhisa*m*khaye.

p. 187

   born in the world and widely renowned as Sambuddha (the perfectly
Enlightened); go quickly to Sâvatthî and behold the best of men.' (998)

   24. 'How then can we know, on seeing him, that he is Buddha, O
Brâhma*n*a? Tell us who do not know him, by what may we recognise him?
(999)

   25. 'For in the hymns are to be found the marks of a great man, and
thirty-two are disclosed altogether, one by one.' (1000)

   26. 'For him on whose limbs these marks of a great man are to be
found, there are two ways left, a third does not exist. (1001)

   27. 'If he abides in a dwelling, he will subdue this earth without
rod (or) sword, he will rule with justice. (1002)

   28. 'And if he departs from his dwelling for the wilderness, he
becomes the saint, incomparable Sambuddha, who has removed the veil
(from the world)<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (1003)

   29. 'Ask in your mind about my birth and family, my marks, hymns, and
my other disciples, the head and head-splitting. (1004)

   30. 'If he is Buddha, the clear-sighted, then he will answer by word
of mouth the questions you have asked in your mind.' (1005)

   31, 32, 33. Having heard Bâvarî's words his disciples, sixteen
Brâhma*n*as, A*g*ita, Tissametteyya, Pu*nn*aka, further Mettagû, Dhotaka
and Upasîva, and Nanda, further Hemaka, the two Todeyya and Kappa, and
the wise *G*atuka*nn*î, Bhadrâvudha and Udaya, and also the Brâhma*n*a
Posâla, and the wise Mogharâ*g*an, and the great Isi Pi<u>n</u>giya,
(1006-1008)

34. All of them, having each their host (of pupils),

\[1. Comp. Lalita-vistara (ed. Calc.), pp. 116, 118.\]

p. 188

and being themselves widely renowned throughout the world, thinkers
delighting in meditation, wise, scented with the perfume of former (good
deeds)<sup>\[1\]</sup>, (1009)

   35. Having saluted Bâvarî and gone round him towards the right, all
with matted hair and bearing hides, departed with their faces turned to
the north. (1010)

   36. To Pati*tth*âna of A*l*aka first, then to Mâhissatî, and also to
U*gg*enî, Gonaddha, Vedisâ, Vanasavhaya, (1011)

   37. And also to Kosambî, Sâketa, and Sâvatthî, the most excellent of
cities, to Setavya, Kapilavatthu, and the city of Kusinâra, (1012)

   38. And to Pâva, the city of wealth, to Vesâlî, the city of Magadha,
to Pâsâ*n*aka *K*etiya (the Rock Temple), the lovely, the charming.
(1013)

   39. As he who is athirst (longs for) the cold water, as the merchant
(longs for) gain, as he who is plagued by heat (longs for) shade, so in
haste they ascended the mountain. (1014)

   40. And Bhagavat at that time attended by the assembly of the
Bhikkhus taught the Dhamma to the Bhikkhus, and roared like a lion in
the forest. (1015)

   41. A*g*ita beheld Sambuddha as the shining (sun) without (burning)
rays, as the moon on the fifteenth, having reached her plenitude. (1016)

   42. Then observing his limbs and all the marks in their fulness,
standing apart, rejoiced, he asked the questions of his mind:-- (1017)

   43. 'Tell me about (my master's) birth, tell me about his family
together with the marks, tell me about his perfection in the hymns, how
many (hymns) does the Brâhma*n*a recite?' (1018)

\[1. Pubbavâsanavâsitâ.\]

p. 189

   44. Bhagavat said: 'One hundred and twenty years (is his) age, and by
family he is a Bâvarî; three are his marks on the limbs, and in the
three Vedas he is perfect. (1019)

   45. 'In the marks and in the Itihâsa together with Nigha*nd*u and
Ke*t*ubha--he recites five hundred--and in his own Dhamma he has reached
perfection.' (1020)

   46. A*g*ita thought: 'Explain fully the marks of Bâvarî, O thou best
of men, who cuts off desire; let there be no doubt left for us.' (1021)

   47. Bhagavat said: 'He covers his face with his tongue, he has a
circle of hair between the eye-brows, (his) privy member (is) hidden in
a sheath, know this, O young man<sup>\[1\]</sup>.' (1022)

   48. Not hearing him ask anything, but hearing the questions answered,
the multitude reflected overjoyed and with joined hands:-- (1023)

   49. 'Who, be he a god, or Brahman, or Inda, the husband of Su*g*â,
asked in his mind those questions, and to whom did that (speech) reply?'
(1024)

   50. A*g*ita said: 'The head and head-splitting Bâvarî asked about;
explain that, O Bhagavat, remove our doubt, O Isi.' (1025)

   51. Bhagavat said: 'Ignorance is the head, know this; knowledge
cleaves the head, together with belief, thoughtfulness, meditation,
determination, and strength.' (1026)

   52. Then with great joy having composed himself the young man put his
hide on one shoulder,

\[1. Mukha*m* *g*ivhâya *kh*âdeti,  
     U*nn*' assa bhamukantare,  
     Kosohita*m* vatthaguyha*m*,  
     Eva*m* *g*ânâhi mâ*n*ava.\]

p. 190

fell at (Bhagavat's) feet (and saluted him) with his head, (saying):
(1027)

   53. 'Bâvarî, the Brâhma*n*a, together with his disciples, O thou
venerable man, delighted and glad, does homage to thy feet, O thou
clearly-seeing.' (1028)

   54. Bhagavat said: 'Let Bâvarî, the Brâhma*n*a, be glad together with
his disciples! Be thou also glad, live long, O young man! (1029)

   55. 'For Bâvarî and for thee, for all there are all (kinds of) doubt;
having got an opportunity, ask ye whatever you wish.' (1030)

   56. After getting permission from Sambuddha, A*g*ita sitting there
with folded hands asked Tathâgata the first question. (1031)

The Vatthugâthâs are ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. A*G*ITAMÂ*N*AVAPU*KKH*Â.

   1. 'By what is the world shrouded,'--so said the venerable
A*g*ita,--'by what does it not shine? What callest thou its pollution,
what is its great danger?' (1032)

   2. 'With ignorance is the world shrouded, O A*g*ita,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'by reason of avarice it does not shine; desire I call its
pollution, pain is its great danger.' (1033)

   3. 'The streams of desire flow in every direction,'--so said the
venerable A*g*ita;--'what dams the streams, say what restrains the
streams, by what may the streams be shut off<sup>\[1\]</sup>?' (1034)

\[1. Comp. [Dhp. v. 340](sbe1026.htm#pp_340).\]

p. 191

   4. 'Whatever streams there are in the world, O A*g*ita,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'thoughtfulness is their dam, thoughtfulness I call the
restraint of the streams, by understanding they are shut off.' (1035)

   5. 'Both understanding and thoughtfulness,'--so said the venerable
A*g*ita,--'and name and shape<sup>\[1\]</sup>, O venerable man,--asked
about this by me, declare by what is this stopped? ' (1036)

   6. Buddha: 'This question which thou hast asked, O A*g*ita, that I
will explain to thee; (I will explain to thee) by what name and
shape<sup>\[2\]</sup> are totally stopped; by the cessation of
consciousness this is stopped here.' (1037)

   7. A*g*ita: 'Those who have examined (all) Dhammas (i.e. the saints),
and those who are disciples, (and those who are) common men here,--when
thou art asked about their mode of life, declare it unto me, thou who
art wise, O venerable man.' (1038)

   8. Buddha: 'Let the Bhikkhu not crave for sensual pleasures, let him
be calm in mind, let him wander about skilful in all Dhammas, and
thoughtful.' (1039)

A*g*itamâ*n*avapu*kkh*â is ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. TISSAMETTEYYAMÂ*N*AVAPU*KKH*Â.

   1. 'Who is contented in the world,'--so said the venerable
Tissametteyya,--'who is without commotions? Who after knowing both ends
does not stick in the middle, as far as his understanding is

\[1. Nâmarûpa*ñ* *k*a.

2\. Nâma*ñ* *k*a rûpa*ñ* *k*a.\]

p. 192

concerned? Whom dost thou call a great man? Who has overcome desire in
this world?' (1040)

   2. 'The Bhikkhu who abstains from sensual pleasures, O Metteyya,'--so
said Bhagavat,--'who is free from desire, always thoughtful, happy by
reflection, he is without commotions, he after knowing both ends does
not stick in the middle, as far as his understanding is concerned; him I
call a great man; he has overcame desire in this world.' (1041)

Tissametteyyamâ*n*avapu*kkh*â is ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. PU*NN*AKAMÂ*N*AVAPU*KKH*Â.

   1. 'To him who is without desire, who has seen the root (of
sin),'--so said the venerable Pu*nn*aka,--'I have come supplicatingly
with a question: on account of what did the Isis and men, Khattiyas and
Brâhma*n*as, offer sacrifices to the gods abundantly in this world?
(about this) I ask thee, O Bhagavat, tell me this.' (1042)

   2. 'All these Isis and men, Khattiyas and Brâhma*n*as, O
Pu*nn*aka,'--so said Bhagavat,--'who offered sacrifices to the gods
abundantly in this world, offered sacrifices, O Pu*nn*aka, after
reaching old age, wishing for their present condition.' (1043)

   3. 'All these Isis and men, Khattiyas and Brâhma*n*as,'--so said the
venerable Pu*nn*aka,--'who offered sacrifices to the gods abundantly in
this world, did they, O Bhagavat, indefatigable in the way of offering,
cross over both birth and old age, O venerable man? I ask thee, O
Bhagavat, tell me this.' (1044)

p. 193

   4. 'They wished for, praised, desired, abandoned (sensual pleasures),
O Pu*nn*aka,'--so said Bhagavat,--'they desired sensual pleasures on
account of what they reached by them; they, devoted to offering, dyed
with the passions of existence, did not cross over birth and old age, so
I say.' (1045)

   5. 'If they, devoted to offering,'--so said the venerable
Pu*nn*aka,--'did not by offering cross over birth and old age, O
venerable man, who then in the world of gods and men crossed over birth
and old age, O venerable man, I ask thee, O Bhagavat, tell me this?'
(1046)

   6. 'Having considered everything<sup>\[1\]</sup> in the world, O
Pu*nn*aka,'--so said Bhagavat,--'he who is not defeated anywhere in the
world, who is calm without the smoke of passions, free from woe, free
from desire, he crossed over birth and old age, so I say.' (1041)

Pu*nn*akamâ*n*avapu*kkh*â is ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. METTAGÛMÂ*N*AVAPU*KKH*Â.

   1. 'I ask thee, O Bhagavat, tell me this,'--so said the venerable
Mettagû,--'I consider thee accomplished and of a cultivated mind, why
are these (creatures), whatsoever they are of many kinds in the world,
always subject to pain? (1048)

   2. 'Thou mayest well ask me concerning the origin of pain, O
Mettagû,'--so said Bhagavat,--

\[1. Parovarânîti parâni *k*a orâni *k*a parattabhâvasakattabhâvâdîni
parâni *k*a orâni *k*â ti vutta*m* hoti. Commentator.\]

p. 194

'I will explain that to thee in the way I myself know it: originating in
the upadhis pains arise, whatsoever they are, of many kinds in the
world. (1049)

   3. 'He who being ignorant creates upadhi, that fool again undergoes
pain; therefore let not the wise man create upadhi, considering (that
this is) the birth and origin of pain.' (1050)

   4. Mettagû: 'What we have asked thee thou hast explained to us;
another (question) I ask thee, answer that, pray: How do the wise cross
the stream, birth and old age, and sorrow and lamentation? Explain that
thoroughly to me, O Muni, for this thing (dhamma) is well known to
thee.' (1051)

   5. 'I will explain the Dhamma to thee, O Mettagû,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'if a man in the visible world, without any traditional
instruction, has understood it, and wanders about thoughtful, he may
overcome desire in the world.' (1052)

   6. Mettagû: 'And I take a delight in that, in the most excellent
Dhamma, O great Isi, which if a man has understood, and he wanders about
thoughtful, he may overcome desire in the world.' (1053)

   7. 'Whatsoever thou knowest, O Mettagû,'--so said Bhagavat,--'(of
what is) above, below, across, and in the middle, taking no delight and
no rest in these things, let thy mind not dwell on existence. (1054)

   8. 'Living so, thoughtful, strenuous, let the Bhikkhu wandering
about, after abandoning selfishness, birth,

\[1. Kittayissâmi te dhamma*m*--Mettagû ti Bhagavâ--

     Tare loke visattika*m*.\]

p. 195

and old age, and sorrow, and lamentation, being a wise man, leave pain
in this world.' (1055)

   9. Mettagû: 'I delight in these words of the great Isi; well
expounded, O Gotama, is (by thee) freedom from upadhi (i.e. Nibbâna).
Bhagavat in truth has left pain, for this Dhamma is well known to
thee<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (1056)

   10. 'And those also will certainly leave pain whom thou, O Muni,
constantly mayest admonish; therefore I bow down to thee, having come
hither, O chief (nâga), may Bhagavat also admonish me constantly.'
(1057)

   11. Buddha: 'The Brâhma*n*a whom I may acknowledge as accomplished,
possessing nothing, not cleaving to the world of lust, he surely has
crossed this stream, and he has crossed over to the other shore, free
from harshness (akhila), (and) free from doubt. (1058)

   12. 'And he is a wise and accomplished man in this world; having
abandoned this cleaving to reiterated existence he is without desire,
free from woe, free from longing, he has crossed over birth and old age,
so I say.' (1059)

Mettagûmâ*n*avapu*kkh*â is ended.

## 6. DHOTAKAMÂ*N*AVAPU*KKH*Â.

   1. 'I ask thee, O Bhagavat, tell me this,'--so said the venerable
Dhotaka,--'I long for thy word, O great Isi; let one, having listened to
thy utterance, learn his own extinction.' (1060)

   2. 'Exert thyself then, O Dhotaka,'--so said Bhagavat,--'being wise
and thoughtful in this world, let one, having listened to my utterance,
learn his own extinction.' (1061)

   3. Dhotaka: 'I see in the world of gods and men a Brâhma*n*a
wandering about, possessing nothing; therefore I bow down to thee, O
thou all-seeing one, free me, O Sakka, from doubts.' (1062)

   4. Buddha: 'I shall not go to free any one in the world who is
doubtful, O Dhotaka; when thou hast learned the best Dhamma, then thou
shalt cross this stream<sup>\[1\]</sup>.' (1063)

   5. Dhotaka: 'Teach (me), O Brâhma*n*a, having compassion (on me), the
Dhamma of seclusion (i.e. Nibbâna), that I may understand (it and) that
I, without falling into many shapes like the air, may wander calm and
independent in this world<sup>\[2\]</sup>.' (?) (1064)

   6. 'I will explain to thee peace<sup>\[1\]</sup>, O Dhotaka,'--so
said Bhagavat;--'if a man in the visible world, without any traditional
instruction, has understood it, and wanders about thoughtful, he may
overcome desire in the world.' (1065)

   7. Dhotaka: 'And I take delight in that, the highest
peace<sup>\[2\]</sup>, O great Isi, which if a man has understood, and
he wanders about thoughtful, he may overcome desire in the world.'
(1066)

   8. 'Whatsoever thou knowest, O Dhotaka,'--so said Bhagavat,--'(of
what is) above, below, across, and in the middle, knowing this to be a
tie in the world, thou must not thirst for reiterated existence.' (1067)

Dhotakamâ*n*avapu*kkh*â is ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. UPASÎVAMÂ*N*AVAPU*KKH*Â.

   1. 'Alone, O Sakka; and without assistance I shall not be able to
cross the great stream,'--so said the venerable Upasîva;--'tell me an
object, O thou all-seeing one, by means of which one may cross this
stream.' (1068)

   2. 'Having in view nothingness, being thoughtful, O Upasiva,'--so
said Bhagavat,--'by the reflection of nothing existing shalt thou cross
the stream; having abandoned sensual pleasures, being loath of doubts,
thou shalt regard the extinction of desire (i.e. Nibbâna), both day and
night<sup>\[3\]</sup>.' (1069)

   3. Upasîva: 'He whose passion for all sensual pleasures has departed,
having resorted to nothingness, after leaving everything else, and being
delivered in the highest deliverance by knowledge, will he remain there
without proceeding further<sup>\[1\]</sup>?' (1070)

   4. 'He whose passion for all sensual pleasures has departed, O
Upasîva,'--so said Bhagavat,--'having resorted to nothingness after
leaving everything else, and being delivered in the highest deliverance
by knowledge, he will remain there without proceeding further.' (1071)

   5. Upasîva: 'If he remains there without proceeding further for a
multitude of years, O thou all-seeing one, (and if) he becomes there
tranquil and delivered, will there be consciousness for such a
one<sup>\[2\]</sup>?' (1072)

   6. 'As a flame blown about by the violence of the wind, O
Upasîva,'--so said Bhagavat,--'goes out, cannot be reckoned (as
existing), even so a Muni, delivered from name and body, disappears, and
cannot be reckoned (as existing)<sup>\[3\]</sup>.' (1073)

   7. Upasîva: 'Has he (only) disappeared, or does he not exist (any
longer), or is he for ever free

   1. 'There are Munis in the world,'--so said the venerable Nanda,--'so
people say. How is this (understood) by thee? Do they call him a Muni
who is possessed of knowledge or him who is possessed of
life<sup>\[3\]</sup>?' (1076)

   2. Buddha: 'Not because of (any philosophical) view, nor of
tradition, nor of knowledge, O Nanda, do the expert call (any one) a
Muni; (but) such as wander free from woe, free from desire, after having
secluded themselves, those I call Munis<sup>\[4\]</sup>.' (1077)

   3. 'All these Sama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as,'--so said the venerable
Nanda,--'say that purity comes from (philosophical) views, and from
tradition, and from virtue and (holy) works, and in many (other) ways.
Did they, in the way in which they lived in the world, cross over birth
and old age, O venerable man? I ask thee, O Bhagavat, tell me this.'
(1078)

   4. 'All these Sama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as, O Nanda,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'say that purity comes from (philosophical) views, and from
tradition, and from virtue and (holy) works, and in many (other) ways;
still they did not, in the way in which they lived in the world, cross
over birth and old age, so I say.' (1079)

   5. 'All these Sama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as,'--so said the venerable
Nanda,--'say that purity comes from (philosophical) views, and from
tradition, and from virtue and (holy) works, and in many (other) ways;
if thou, O Muni, sayest that such have not crossed the stream, who then
in the world of gods and men crossed over birth and old age, O venerable
man? I ask thee, O Bhagavat, tell me this.' (1080)

   6. 'I do not say that all Sama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as, O Nanda,'--so
said Bhagavat,--'are shrouded by birth and old age; those who, after
leaving in this world what has been seen or heard or thought, and all
virtue and (holy) works, after leaving everything of various kinds,
after penetrating desire, are free from passion, such indeed I call men

all virtue and (holy) works, after leaving everything of various kinds,
after penetrating desire, are free from passion, such I call men that

Hemaka,--'explained to me the doctrine of Gotama, saying, "So it was, so
it will be," all that (was only) oral tradition, all that (was only)
something that increased (my) doubts<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (1083)

   2. 'I took no pleasure in that, but tell thou me the Dhamma that
destroys desire, O Muni, which if a man has understood, and he wanders
about thoughtful, he may cross desire in the world.' (1084)

   3. Buddha: 'In this world (much) has been seen,

Todeyya,--'to whom there is no desire, and who has overcome doubt, what
sort of deliverance is there for him?' (1087)

   2. 'He in whom there live no lusts, O Todeyya,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'to whom there is no desire, and who has overcome doubt, for
him there is no other deliverance.' (1088)

   3. Todeyya: 'Is he without breathing or is he breathing, is he
possessed of understanding or is he forming himself an
understanding<sup>\[2\]</sup>? Explain this to me, O thou all-seeing

venerable Kappa,--'in the formidable stream that has set in, for those
who are overcome by decay and death, tell me of an island, O venerable
man, and tell thou me of an island that this (pain) may not again come
on<sup>\[1\]</sup>.' (1091)

   2. 'For those who stand in the middle of the water, O Kappa,'--so
said Bhagavat,--'in the formidable stream that has set in, for those
overcome by decay and death, I will tell thee of an island, O Kappa.'

is free from lust; tell me the seat of peace, O thou with the born eye
(of wisdom), tell me this truly, O Bhagavat. (1095)

   2. 'For Bhagavat wanders about after having conquered lust as the hot
sun (conquers) the earth by its heat; tell the Dhamma to me who has
(only) little understanding, O thou of great understanding, that I may
ascertain how to leave in this world birth and decay.' (1096)

   3. 'Subdue thy greediness for sensual pleasures, O
*G*atuka*nn*in,'--so said Bhagavat,--'having considered the forsaking of
the world as happiness, let there not be anything either grasped after
or rejected by thee<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (1097)

desire,'--so (said) the venerable Bhadrâvudha,--'who is free from
commotion, forsakes joy, has crossed the stream, is liberated, and who
leaves time behind; having heard the chief's (word), they will go away
from here<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (1100)

O Bhadrâvudha,'--so said Bhagavat,--'above, below, across, and in the
middle; for whatever they grasp after in the world, just by that Mâra
follows the man. (1102)

   4. 'Therefore, knowing this, let not the thoughtful Bhikkhu grasp

said the venerable Udaya,--'having performed his duty, who is without
passion, accomplished in all things (dhamma), I have come with a
question; tell me the deliverance by knowledge, the splitting up of
ignorance.' (1104)

   2. '(It consists in) leaving lust and desire, O Udaya,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'and both (kinds of) grief, and driving away sloth, and
warding off misbehaviour. (1105)

   3. 'The deliverance by knowledge which is purified by equanimity and
thoughtfulness and preceded by reasoning on Dhamma I will tell thee, the
splitting up of ignorance<sup>\[1\]</sup>.' (1106)

the leaving of what is Nibbâna said to be<sup>\[2\]</sup>?' (1107)

practice; by the leaving of desire Nibbâna is said to be.' (1108)

Posâla,--'who is without desire and has cut off doubt, to him who is
accomplished in all things (dhamma), I have come supplicatingly with a
question. (1111)

   2. 'O Sakka, I ask about his knowledge who is aware of past shapes,
who casts off every corporeal form, and who sees that there exists
nothing either internally or externally; how can such a one be led (by
anybody)<sup>\[1\]</sup>? (1112)

   3. 'Tathâgata, knowing all the faces of consciousness, O Posâla,'--so

the divine Isi is asked for the third time, he will explain it, so I
have heard. (1115)

   2. 'There is this world, the other world, Brahman's world together
with the world of the gods; I do not know thy view, the famous Gotama's
(view). (1116)

   3. 'To this man who sees what is good I have come supplicatingly with
a question: How is any one to look upon the world that the king of death
may not see him?' (1117)

   4. 'Look upon the world as void, O Mogharâ*g*an, being always
thoughtful; having destroyed the view of oneself (as really existing),

## 17. PI<u>N</u>GIYAMÂ*N*AVAPU*KKH*Â.

   1. 'I am old, feeble, colourless,'--so said the venerable
Pi<u>n</u>giya,--'my eyes are not clear, my hearing is not good; lest I
should perish a fool on the way, tell me the Dhamma, that I may know how
to leave birth and decay in this world.' (1119)

   2. 'Seeing others afflicted by the body, O Pi<u>n</u>giya,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'(seeing) heedless people suffer in their bodies;--therefore,
O Pi<u>n</u>giya, shalt thou be heedful, and leave the body behind, that
thou mayest never come to exist again.' (1120)

   3. Pi<u>n</u>giya: 'Four regions, four intermediate regions, above
and below, these are the ten regions; there is nothing which has not
been seen, heard, or thought by thee, and (is there) anything in the
world not understood (by thee)? Tell (me) the Dhamma, that I may know
how to leave birth and decay in this world' (1121)

   4. 'Seeing men seized with desire, O Pi<u>n</u>giya,'--so said
Bhagavat,--'tormented and overcome by decay,--therefore thou, O
Pi<u>n</u>giya, shalt be heedful, and leave desire behind, that thou
mayest never come to exist again.' (1122)

Pi<u>n</u>giyamâ*n*avapu*kkh*â is ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This said Bhagavat, living in Magadha at Pâsâ*n*aka *K*etiya (the
Rock Temple). Sought by sixteen Brâhma*n*as, the followers (of Bâvarî,
and) questioned by each of them in turn, he responded to the questions.
If a man, having understood the meaning and tenor of each question,
lives according to the Dhamma, then he will go to the further shore of
decay and death, for these Dhammas lead to the

p. 209

further shore, and therefore this order of Dhamma was called 'the way to
the other shore.'

   1, 2. A*g*ita, Tissametteyya, Pu*nn*aka and Mettagû, Dhotaka and
Upasîva, Nanda and Hemaka, the two Todeyya and Kappa, and the wise
*G*atuka*nn*in, Bhadrâvudha and Udaya, and also the Brâhma*n*a Posâla,
and the wise Mogharâ*g*an, and Pi<u>n</u>giya the great Isi, (1123,
1124)

   3. These went up to Buddha, the Isi of exemplary conduct; asking
subtle questions they went up to the supreme Buddha. (1125)

   4. Buddha, being asked, responded to their questions truly, and in
responding to the questions the Muni delighted the Brâhma*n*as.(1126)

   5. They, having been delighted by the clearly-seeing Buddha, the
kinsman of the Âdi*kk*as, devoted themselves to a religious life near
the man of excellent understanding. (1127)

   6. He who lived according to what had been taught by Buddha (in
answer) to each single question, went from this shore to the other
shore. (1128)

   7. From this shore he went to the other shore entering upon the most
excellent way; this way is to lead to the other shore, therefore it is
called 'the way to the other shore.' (1129)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   8. 'I will proclaim accordingly the way to the further shore,'--so
said the venerable Pi<u>n</u>giya;--'as he saw it, so he told it; the
spotless, the very wise, the passionless, the desireless lord, for what
reason should he speak falsely? (1130)

   9. 'Well! I will praise the beautiful voice of (Buddha), who is
without stain and folly, and who has left behind arrogance and
hypocrisy. (1131)

   10. 'The darkness-dispelling Buddha, the all-seeing,

p. 211

who thoroughly understands the world<sup>\[1\]</sup>, has overcome all
existences, is free from passion, has left behind all pain, is rightly
called (Buddha), he, O Brâhma*n*a, has come to me. (1132)

   11. 'As the bird, having left the bush, takes up his abode in the
fruitful forest, even so I, having left men of narrow views, have
reached the great sea, like the ha*m*sa<sup>\[2\]</sup>. (1133)

night and day; worshipping I spend the night, therefore I think I do not
stay away from him. (1141)

   20. 'Belief and joy, mind and thought incline me towards the doctrine
of Gotama; whichever way the very wise man goes, the very same I am
inclined to<sup>\[1\]</sup>. (?) (1142)

   21. 'Therefore, as I am worn out and feeble, my body does not go
there, but in my thoughts I always go there, for my mind, O Brâhma*n*a,
is joined to him. (1143)

   22. 'Lying in the mud (of lusts) wriggling, I jumped from island to
island; then I saw the perfectly Enlightened, who has crossed the
stream, and is free from passion.' (1144)

   23. Bhagavat<sup>\[2\]</sup>: 'As Vakkali was delivered by

2\. At the conclusion of this (i.e. the preceding) gâthâ, Bhagavat, who
stayed at Sâvatthî, when seeing the maturity of the minds of
Pi<u>n</u>giya and Bâvarî, shed a golden light. Pi<u>n</u>giya, who sat
picturing Buddha's virtues to Bâvarî, having seen the light, looked
round, saying, 'What is this?' And when he saw Bhagavat standing, as it
were, before him, he said to the Brâhma*n*a Bâvarî: 'Buddha has come.'
The Brâhma*n*a rose from his seat and stood with folded hands. Bhagavat,
