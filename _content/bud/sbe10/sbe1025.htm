<p>p. 77</p> <h2 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2> 
<p align="CENTER">THE ELEPHANT.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;320.&nbsp;Silently shall I endure abuse as the elephant in battle endures the arrow sent from the bow: for the world is ill-natured.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;321.&nbsp;They lead a tamed elephant to battle, the king mounts a tamed elephant; the tamed is the best among men, he who silently endures abuse.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;322.&nbsp;Mules are good, if tamed, and noble Sindhu horses, and elephants with large tusks; but he who tames himself is better still.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;323.&nbsp;For with these animals does no man reach the untrodden country (Nirv&acirc;<i>n</i>a), where a tamed man goes on a tamed animal, viz. on his own well-tamed self.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;324.&nbsp;The elephant called Dhanap&acirc;laka, his temples running with sap, and difficult to hold, does not eat a morsel when bound; the elephant longs for the elephant grove.</p> 
<p>[320. The elephant is with the Buddhists the emblem of endurance and self-restraint. Thus Buddha himseIf is called N&acirc;ga, 'the Elephant' (Lal. Vist. p. 553), or Mah&acirc;n&acirc;ga, 'the great Elephant' (Lal. Vist. p. 553), and in one passage (Lal. Vist. p. 554) the reason of this name is given, by stating that Buddha was sud&acirc;nta, 'well-tamed,' like an elephant. He descended from heaven in the form of an elephant to be born on earth.</p> 
<p>Cf. Manu VI, 47, ativ&acirc;d&acirc;<i>m</i>s titiksheta.</p> 
<p>323. I read, as suggested by Dr. Fausb&ouml;ll, yath' attan&acirc; sudantena danto dantena ga<i>kkh</i>ati' (cf. <a href="sbe1014.htm#pp_160">verse 160</a>). The India Office MS. reads na hi etehi <i>th</i>&acirc;nehi ga<i>kkh</i>eya agata<i>m</i> disam, yath' att&acirc;na<i>m</i> sudantena danto dantena ga<i>kkh</i>ati. As to <i>th</i>&acirc;nehi instead of y&acirc;nehi, see <a href="sbe1019.htm#pp_224">verse 224</a>.]</p> 
<p>p. 78</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;325.&nbsp;If a man becomes fat and a great eater, if he is sleepy and rolls himself about, that fool, like a hog fed on wash, is born again and again.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;326.&nbsp;This mind of mine went formerly wandering about as it liked, as it listed, as it pleased; but I shall now hold it in thoroughly, as the rider who holds the hook holds in the furious elephant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;327.&nbsp;Be not thoughtless, watch your thoughts! Draw yourself out of the evil way, like an elephant sunk in mud.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;328.&nbsp;If a man find a prudent companion who walks with him, is wise, and lives soberly, he may walk with him, overcoming all dangers, happy, but considerate.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;329.&nbsp;If a man find no prudent companion who walks with him, is wise, and lives soberly, let him walk alone, like a king who has left his conquered country behind,--like an elephant in the forest.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;330.&nbsp;It is better to live alone, there is no companionship with a fool; let a man walk alone, let him commit no sin, with few wishes, like an elephant in the forest.</p> 
<p>[326. Yoniso, i.e. yoni<i>s</i>a<i>h</i>, is rendered by Dr. Fausb&ouml;ll 'sapienti&acirc;,' and this is the meaning ascribed to yoni by many Buddhist authorities. But the reference to Hema<i>k</i>andra (ed. Boehtlingk and Rieu, p. 281) shows clearly that it meant 'origin,' or 'cause.' Yoniso occurs frequently as a mere adverb, meaning 'thoroughly, radically' (Dhammapada, p. 359), and yoniso manasik&acirc;ra (Dhammapada, p. 110) means 'taking to heart' or 'minding thoroughly,' or, what is nearly the same, 'wisely.' In the Lalita-vistara, p. 41, the commentator has clearly mistaken yoni<i>s</i>a<i>h</i>, changing it to ye 'ni<i>s</i>o, and explaining it by yamni<i>s</i>am, whereas M. Foucaux has rightly translated it by 'depuis l'origine.' Professor Weber suspected in yoni<i>s</i>a<i>h</i> a double entendre, but even grammar would show that our author is innocent of it. In Lalita-vistara, p. 544, l. 4, ayoni<i>s</i>a occurs in the sense of error.</p> 
<p>328, 329. Cf. <a href="sbe1033.htm#pp_44">Suttanip&acirc;ta, vv. 44, 45</a>.]</p> 
<p>p. 79</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;331.&nbsp;If an occasion arises, friends are pleasant; enjoyment is pleasant, whatever be the cause; a good work is pleasant in the hour of death; the giving up of all grief is pleasant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;332.&nbsp;Pleasant in the world is the state of a mother, pleasant the state of a father, pleasant the state of a Sama<i>n</i>a, pleasant the state of a Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;333.&nbsp;Pleasant is virtue lasting to old age, pleasant is a faith firmly rooted; pleasant is attainment of intelligence, pleasant is avoiding of sins.</p> 
<p>[332. The commentator throughout takes these words, like matteyyat&acirc;, &amp;c., to signify, not the status of a mother, or maternity, but reverence shown to a mother.]</p>
