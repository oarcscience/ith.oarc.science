<p><hr></p> <h2 align="CENTER">1. RATANASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>For all beings salvation is only to be found in Buddha, Dhamma, and Sa<u>n</u>gha.--Text and translation in Childers' Khuddaka P&acirc;<i>th</i>a, p. 6.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. Whatever spirits have come together here, either belonging to the earth or living in the air, let all spirits be happy, and then listen attentively to what is said. (221)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Therefore, O spirits, do ye all pay attention, show kindness to the human race who both day and night bring their offerings; therefore protect them strenuously. (222)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. Whatever wealth there be here or in the other world, or whatever excellent jewel in the heavens, it is certainly not equal to Tath&acirc;gata. This excellent jewel (is found) in Buddha, by this truth may there be salvation. (223)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. The destruction (of passion), the freedom from passion, the excellent immortality which Sakyamuni attained (being) composed,--there is nothing equal to that Dhamma. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Dhamma, by this truth may there be salvation. (224)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. The purity which the best of Buddhas praised, the meditation which they call uninterrupted, there is no meditation like this. This excellent jewel (is</p> 
<p><a>p. 38</a></p> 
<p>found) in the Dhamma, by this truth may there be salvation. (225)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. The eight persons that are praised by the righteous<sup>[1]</sup>, and make these four pairs, they are worthy of offerings, (being) Sugata's disciples; what is given to these will bear great fruit. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly (sa<u>n</u>gha), by this truth may there be salvation. (226)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. Those who have applied themselves studiously with a firm mind and free from desire to the commandments of Gotama, have obtained the highest gain, having merged into immortality, and enjoying happiness after getting it for nothing. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (227)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. As a post in the front of a city gate is firm in the earth and cannot be shaken by the four winds, like that I declare the righteous man to be who, having penetrated the noble truths, sees (them clearly). This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (228)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. Those who understand the noble truths well taught by the profoundly wise (i.e. Buddha), though they be greatly distracted, will not (have to) take the eighth birth. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (229)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. On his (attaining the) bliss of (the right) view three things (dhammas) are left behind (by him): conceit and doubt and whatever he has got of virtue and (holy) works. He is released also from the four hells, and he is incapable of committing the six</p> 
<p>[1. The Commentator: satam pasatth&acirc; ti sappurisehi buddhapa<i>kk</i>ekabuddhas&acirc;vakehi a<i>&ntilde;&ntilde;</i>ehi <i>k</i>a devamanusehi pasatth&acirc;.]</p> 
<p><a>p. 39</a></p> 
<p>deadly sins. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (230)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. Even if he commit a sinful deed by his body, or in word or in thought, he is incapable of concealing it, (for) to conceal is said to be impossible for one that has seen the state (of Nibb&acirc;na). This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (231)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. As in a clump of trees with their tops in bloom in the first heat of the hot month, so (Buddha) taught the excellent Dhamma leading to Nibb&acirc;na to the greatest benefit (for all). This excellent jewel (is found) in Buddha, by this truth may there be salvation. (232)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. The excellent one who knows what is excellent, who gives what is excellent, and who brings what is excellent, the incomparable one taught the excellent Dhamma. This excellent jewel (is found) in Buddha, by this truth may there be salvation. (233)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. The old is destroyed, the new has not arisen, those whose minds are disgusted with a future existence, the wise who have destroyed their seeds (of existence, and) whose desires do not increase, go out like this lamp. This excellent jewel (is found) in the Assembly, by this truth may there be salvation. (234)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. Whatever spirits have come together here, either belonging to the earth or living in the air, let us worship the perfect (tath&acirc;gata) Buddha, revered by gods and men; may there be salvation. (235)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. Whatever spirits have come together here, either belonging to the earth or living in the air, let us worship the perfect (tath&acirc;gata) Dhamma, revered by gods and men; may there be salvatlon. (236)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>17. Whatever spirits have come together here,</p> 
<p><a>p. 40</a></p> 
<p>either belonging to the earth or living in the air, let us worship the perfect (tath&acirc;gata) Sa<u>n</u>gha, revered by gods and men; may there be salvation. (237)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. &Acirc;magandhabr&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a: 'Those who eat s&acirc;m&acirc;ka, <i>k</i>ing&ucirc;laka, and <i>k</i>&icirc;naka, pattaphala, m&ucirc;laphala, and gaviphala (different sorts of grass, leaves, roots, &amp;c.), justly obtained of the just, do not speak falsehood, (nor are they) desirous of sensual pleasures.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. 'He who eats what has been well prepared, well dressed, what is pure and excellent, given by others, he who enjoys food made of rice, eats, O Kassapa, &Acirc;magandha (what defiles one). (239)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. '(The charge of) &Acirc;magandha does not apply to me,' so thou sayest, 'O Brahman (brahmabandhu, although) enjoying food (made) of rice together with the well-prepared flesh of birds. I ask thee, O Kassapa, the meaning of this, of what description (is then) thy &Acirc;magandha?' (240)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. Kassapabuddha: 'Destroying living beings, killing, cutting, binding, stealing, speaking falsehood, fraud and deception, worthless reading<sup>[1]</sup>, intercourse with another's wife;--this is &Acirc;magandha, but not the eating of flesh. (241)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'Those persons who in this world are unrestrained in (enjoying) sensual pleasures, greedy of sweet things, associated with what is impure, sceptics (natthikadi<i>tth</i>i), unjust, difficult to follow;--this is &Acirc;magandha, but not the eating of flesh. (242)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'Those who are rough, harsh, backbiting, treacherous, merciless, arrogant, and (who being) illiberal do not give anything to any one;--this is &Acirc;magandha, but not the eating of flesh. (243)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'Anger, intoxication, obstinacy, bigotry, deceit, envy, grandiloquence, pride and conceit, intimacy with the unjust;--this is &Acirc;magandha, but not the eating of flesh. (244)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'Those who in this world are wicked, and such as do not pay their debts, are slanderers, false in their dealings, counterfeiters, those who in this world being the lowest of men commit sin;--this is &Acirc;magandha, but not the eating of flesh. (245)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'Those persons who in this world are unrestrained (in their behaviour) towards living creatures, who are bent upon injuring after taking others' (goods), wicked, cruel, harsh, disrespectful;--this is &Acirc;magandha, but not the eating of flesh. (246)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. 'Those creatures who are greedy of these (living beings, who are) hostile, offending; always bent upon (evil) and therefore, when dead, go to darkness and fall with their heads downwards into hell;--this is &Acirc;magandha, but not the eating of flesh. (247)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'Neither the flesh of fish, nor fasting, nor nakedness, nor tonsure, nor matted hair, nor dirt, nor rough skins, nor the worshipping of the fire, nor the many immortal penances in the world, nor hymns, nor oblations, nor sacrifice, nor observance of the</p> 
<p><a>p. 42</a></p> 
<p>seasons, purify a mortal who has not conquered his doubt<sup>[1]</sup>. (248)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. 'The wise man wanders about with his organs of sense guarded, and his senses conquered, standing firm in the Dhamma, delighting in what is right and mild; having overcome all ties and left behind all pain, he does not cling to what is seen and heard.' (249)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. Thus Bhagavat preached this subject again and again, (and the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a) who was accomplished in the hymns (of the Vedas) understood it; the Muni who is free from defilement, independent, and difficult to follow, made it clear in various stanzas. (250)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. Having heard Buddha's well-spoken words, which are free from defilement and send away all pain, he worshipped Tath&acirc;gata's (feet) in humility, and took orders at once. (251)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Whosoever uses pleasing words to friends without effect<sup>[2]</sup>, him the wise know as one that (only) talks, but does not do anything. (253)</p>

<p><hr></p> <h2 align="CENTER">5. S&Ucirc;<i>K</i>ILOMASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>The Yakkha S&ucirc;<i>k</i>iloma threatens to harm Buddha, if he cannot answer his questions. Buddha answers that all passions proceed from the body.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Gay&acirc; (seated) on a stone seat in the realm of the Yakkha S&ucirc;<i>k</i>iloma. And at that time the Yakkha Khara and the Yakkha S&ucirc;<i>k</i>iloma passed by, not far from Bhagavat. And then the Yakkha Khara said this to the Yakkha S&ucirc;<i>k</i>iloma: 'Is this man a Sama<i>n</i>a?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&ucirc;<i>k</i>iloma answered: 'He is no Sama<i>n</i>a, he is a Sama<i>n</i>aka (a wretched Sama<i>n</i>a); however I will ascertain whether he is a Sama<i>n</i>a or a Sama<i>n</i>aka.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Yakkha S&ucirc;<i>k</i>iloma went up to Bhagavat, and having gone up to him, he brushed against Bhagavat's body. Then Bhagavat took away his body. Then the Yakkha S&ucirc;<i>k</i>iloma said this to Bhagavat: 'O Sama<i>n</i>a, art thou afraid of me?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhagavat answered: 'No, friend, I am not afraid of thee, but thy touching me is sinful.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&ucirc;<i>k</i>iloma said: 'I will ask thee a question, O Sama<i>n</i>a; if thou canst not answer it I will either scatter thy thoughts or cleave thy heart, or take thee by the feet and throw thee over to the other shore of the Ga<u>n</u>g&acirc;.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhagavat answered: 'I do not see, O friend, neither in this world together with the world of the Devas, M&acirc;ras, Brahmans, nor amongst the generation of Sama<i>n</i>a and Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, gods and men, the one who can either scatter my thoughts or cleave my heart, or take me by the feet and throw me over</p> 
<p><a>p. 46</a></p> 
<p>to the other shore of the Ga<u>n</u>g&acirc;. However ask, O friend, what thou pleasest.' Then the Yakkha S&ucirc;<i>k</i>iloma addressed Bhagavat in a stanza:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. ' What origin have passion and hatred, disgust, delight, and horror? wherefrom do they arise? whence arising do doubts vex the mind, as boys vex a crow?' (269)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Buddha said: 'Passion and hatred have their origin from this (body), disgust, delight, and horror arise from this body; arising from this (body) doubts vex the mind, as boys vex a crow. (270)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'They originate in desire, they arise in self, like the shoots of the banyan tree; far and wide they are connected, with sensual pleasures, like the m&acirc;luv&acirc; creeper spread in the wood. (271)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'Those who know whence it (sin) arises, drive it away. Listen, O Yakkha! They cross over this stream that is difficult to cross, and has not been crossed before, with a view to not being born again.' (272)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. A just life, a religious life, this they call the best gem, if any one has gone forth from house-life to a houseless life. (273)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. But if he be harsh-spoken, and like a beast delighting in injuring (others), then the life of such a one is very wicked, and he increases his own pollution. (274)</p> 
<p><a>p. 47</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. A Bhikkhu who delights in quarrelling and is shrouded in folly, does not understand the Dhamma that is preached and taught by Buddha. (275)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. Injuring his own cultivated mind, and led by ignorance, he does not understand that sin is the way leading to hell. (276)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. Having gone to calamity, from womb to womb, from darkness to darkness, such a Bhikkhu verily, after passing away, goes to pain. (277)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. As when there is a pit of excrement (that has become) full during a number of years,--he who should be such a one full of sin is difficult to purify. (278)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. Whom you know to be such a one, O Bhikkhus, (a man) dependent on a house, having sinful desires, sinful thoughts, and being with sinful deeds and objects, (279)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. Him do avoid, being all in concord; blow him away as sweepings, put him away as rubbish. (280)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. Then remove as chaff those that are no Sama<i>n</i>as, (but only) think themselves, blowing away those that have sinful desires and those with sinful deeds and objects. (281)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. Be pure and live together with the pure, being thoughtful; then agreeing (and) wise you will put an end to pain. (282)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt at S&acirc;vatth&icirc;, in <i>G</i>etavana, in the park of An&acirc;thapi<i>nd</i>ika. Then many wealthy Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as of Kosala, decrepit, elderly, old, advanced in age, or arrived at extreme old age, went to Bhagavat, and having gone to him they talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable talk with him, they sat down apart. Sitting down apart these wealthy Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as said this to Bhagavat: 'O venerable Gotama, are the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as now-a-days seen (engaged) in the Br&acirc;hmanical customs (dhamma) of the ancient Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as?'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhagavat answered: 'The Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as now-a-days, O Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, are not seen (engaged) in the Br&acirc;hmanical customs of the ancient Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes,' so saying the wealthy Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as listened to Bhagavat. Bhagavat said this:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. The old sages (isayo) were self-restrained, penitent; having abandoned the objects of the five senses, they studied their own welfare. (283)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. There were no cattle for the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, nor gold, nor corn, (but) the riches and corn of meditation were for them, and theey kept watch over the best treasure. (284)</p> 
<p><a>p. 49</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. What was prepared for them and placed as food at the door, they thought was to be given to those that seek for what has been prepared by faith. (285)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. With garments variously coloured, with beds and abodes, prosperous people from the provinces and the whole country worshipped those Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as. (286)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. Inviolable were the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, invincible, protected by the Dhamma, no one opposed them (while standing) at the doors of the houses anywhere. (287)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. For forty-eight years they practised juvenile chastity, the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as formerly went in search of science and exemplary conduct. (288)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. The Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as did not marry (a woman belonging to) another (caste), nor did they buy a wife; they chose living together in mutual love after having come together. (289)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. Excepting from the time about the cessation of the menstruation else the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as did not indulge in sexual intercourse<sup>[1]</sup>. (290)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. They praised chastity and virtue, rectitude, mildness, penance, tenderness, compassion, and patience. (291)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. He who was the best of them, a strong Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a, did not (even) in sleep indulge in sexual intercourse. (292)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. Imitating his practices some wise men in this world praised chastity and patience. (293)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. Having asked for rice, beds, garments, butter. and oil, and gathered them justly, they made sacrifices</p> 
<p>[1. A<i>&ntilde;&ntilde;</i>atra tamh&acirc; samay&acirc;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utuverama<i>n</i>im pati<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antar&acirc; methuna<i>m</i> dhamma<i>m</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N&acirc;su ga<i>kkh</i>anti br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>&acirc;.]</p> 
<p><a>p. 50</a></p> 
<p>out of them, and when the sacrifice came on, they did not kill cows. (294)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. Like unto a mother, a father, a brother, and other relatives the cows are our best friends, in which medicines are produced. (295)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. They give food, and they give strength, they likewise give (a good) complexion and happiness; knowing the real state of this, they did not kill cows. (296)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. They were graceful, large, handsome, renowned, Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as by nature, zealous for their several works; as long as they lived in the world, this race prospered. (297)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. But there was a change in them: after gradually seeing the king's prosperity and adorned women, (298)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>17. Well-made chariots drawn by noble horses, carpets in variegated colours, palaces and houses, divided into compartments and measured out, (299)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>18. The great human wealth, attended with a number of cows, and combined with a flock of beautiful women, the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as became covetous. (300)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. They then, in this matter, having composed hymns, went to Okk&acirc;ka, and said: 'Thou hast much wealth and corn, sacrifice thy great property, sacrifice thy great wealth.' (301)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>20. And then the king, the lord of chariots, instructed by the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, brought about assamedha, purisamedha, samm&acirc;p&acirc;sa, and v&acirc;<i>k</i>&acirc;peyya without any hinderance, and having offered these sacrifices he gave the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as wealth: (302)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>21. Cows, beds, garments, and adorned women, and well-made chariots, drawn by noble horses, carpets in variegated colours, (303)</p> 
<p><a>p. 51</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>22. Beautiful palaces, well divided into compartments; and having filled these with different (sorts of) corn, he gave this wealth to the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as. (304)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>23. And they having thus received wealth wished for a store, and the desire of those who had given way to (their) wishes increased still more; they then, in this matter, having composed hymns, went again to Okk&acirc;ka, and said: (305)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>24. 'As water, earth, gold, wealth, and corn, even so are there cows for men, for this is a requisite for living beings; sacrifice thy great property, sacrifice thy wealth.' (306)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>25. And then the king, the lord of chariots, instructed by the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, caused many hundred thousand cows to be slain in offerings. (307)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>26. The cows, that are like goats, do not hurt any one with their feet or with either of their horns, they are tender, and yield vessels (of milk),--seizing them by the horns the king caused them to be slain with a weapon. (308)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>27. Then the gods, the forefathers, Inda, the Asuras, and the Rakkhasas cried out: 'This is injustice,' because of the weapon falling on the cows. (309)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>28. There were formerly three diseases: desire, hunger, and decay, but from the slaying of cattle there came ninety-eight. (310)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>29. This injustice of (using) violence that has come down (to us), was old; innocent (cows) are slain, the sacrificing (priests) have fallen off from the Dhamma. (311)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>30. So this old and mean Dhamma is blamed by the wise; where people see such a one, they blame the sacrificing priest. (312)</p> 
<p><a>p. 52</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>31. So Dhamma being lost, the Suddas and the Vessikas disagreed, the Khattiyas disagreed in manifold ways, the wife despised her husband. (313)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>32. The Khattiyas and the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as and those others who had been protected by their castes, after doing away with their disputes on descent, fell into the power of sensual pleasures. (314)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This having been said, those wealthy Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as said to Bhagavat as follows:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma has been illustrated; we take refuge in the venerable Gotama, in the Dhamma, and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus; may the venerable Gotama receive us as followers (up&acirc;saka), who from this day for life have taken refuge (in him).'</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. A man should worship him from whom he learns the Dhamma, as the gods (worship) Inda; the learned man being worshipped and pleased with him, makes the (highest) Dhamma manifest. (315)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Having heard and considered that (Dhamma), the wise man practising the Dhamma that is in</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. He who serves a low (teacher), a fool who has not understood the meaning, and who is envious, goes to death, not having overcome doubt, and not having understood the Dhamma. (317)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. As a man, after descending into a river, a turgid water with a rapid current, is borne along following the current,--how will he be able to put others across? (318)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. Even so how will a man, not having understood the Dhamma, and not attending to the explanation of the learned and not knowing it himself, not having overcome doubt, be able to make others understand it? (319)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. As one, having gone on board a strong ship, provided with oars and rudder, carries across in it many others, knowing the way to do it, and being expert and thoughtful, (320)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. So also he who is accomplished, of a cultivated mind, learned, intrepid, makes others endowed with attention and assiduity understand it, knowing (it himself). (321)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. Therefore indeed one should cultivate (the society of) a good man, who is intelligent and learned; he who leads a regular life, having understood what is good and penetrated the Dhamma, will obtain happiness. (322)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was heard by me:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time Bhagavat dwelt at A<i>l</i>av&icirc;, in the temple of Agg&acirc;<i>l</i>ava.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Lord, while retired and meditating, this reflection occurred to me here: Whether my teacher be blessed or whether he be not blessed.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the venerable Va<u>n</u>g&icirc;sa, rising from his seat, throwing his robe over one shoulder and bending his joined hands towards Bhagavat, addressed him in stanzas:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. 'We ask the Master of excellent understanding: he who in this world had cut off doubt, died at Agg&acirc;<i>l</i>ava, a Bhikkhu, well known, famous, and of a calm mind. (342)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. 'For thou knowest the doings of this world and that of the gods, and the final end; there is nobody like thee seeing the subtle meaning (of things); they call thee the excellent Buddha. (376)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. 'Knowing all knowledge thou hast revealed the Dhamma, having compassion on creatures; thou hast removed the veil (of the world), thou art all-seeing, thou shinest spotless in all the world. (377)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. 'The king of elephants, Er&acirc;va<i>n</i>a by name, hearing that thou wert <i>G</i>ina (the Conqueror), came to thy presence, and having conversed with thee he went away delighted, after listening (to thee, and saying), "Very good!" (378)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. 'Also king Vessava<i>n</i>a Kuvera came to ask thee about the Dhamma; him, too, thou, O wise man, answeredst when asked, and he also after listening was delighted. (379)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. 'All these disputatious Titthiyas and &Acirc;<i>g</i>&icirc;vikas and Niga<i>nth</i>as do not any of them overcome thee in understanding, as a man standing (does not overcome) the one that is walking quickly. (380)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. 'All these disputatious Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, and there are even some old Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>as, all are bound by thy opinion, and others also that are considered disputants. (381)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. 'This subtle and pleasant Dhamma that has</p> 
<p><a>p. 64</a></p> 
<p>been well proclaimed by thee, O Bhagavat, and which we all long to hear, do thou, O thou best of Buddhas, speak to us when asked. (382)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. 'Let all these Bhikkhus and also Up&acirc;sakas that have sat down to listen, hear the Dhamma learnt (anubuddha) by the stainless (Buddha), as the gods (hear) the well-spoken (words) of V&acirc;sava.' (383)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. Bhagavat: 'Listen to me, O Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dhamma that destroys sin, do ye keep it, all of you; let him who looks for what is salutary, the thoughtful, cultivate the mode of life suitable for Pabba<i>g</i>itas. (384)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. 'Let not the Bhikkhu walk about at a wrong time, let him go to the village for alms at the right time; for ties ensnare the one that goes at a wrong time, therefore Buddhas do not go at a wrong time. (385)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. 'Form, sound, taste, smell, and touch which intoxicate creatures, having subdued the desire for (all) these things (dhammas), let him in due time go in for his breakfast. (386)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. 'And let the Bhikkhu, after having obtained his food at the right time and returned, sit down alone and privately; reflecting within himself let him not turn his mind to outward things, (but be) self-collected. (387)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. 'If he speak with a S&acirc;vaka or with anybody else, or with a Bhikkhu, let him talk about the excellent Dhamma, (but let him) not (utter) slander, nor blaming words against others. (388)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. 'For some utter language contradicting others<sup>[1]</sup>; those narrow-minded ones we do not praise. Ties</p> 
<p>[1. V&acirc;da<i>m</i> hi eke pa<i>t</i>iseniyanti = viru<i>ggh</i>anti yu<i>ggh</i>ituk&acirc;m&acirc; hutv&acirc; sen&acirc;ya pa<i>t</i>imukha<i>m</i> ga<i>kkh</i>ant&acirc; viya honti. Commentator.]</p> 
<p><a>p. 65</a></p> 
<p>from here and there ensnare them, and they send their mind far away in that (dispute). (389)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. 'Let a S&acirc;vaka of him with the excellent understanding (Buddha), after hearing the Dhamma taught by Sugata, discriminately seek for food, a monastery, a bed and a chair, and water for taking away the dirt of his clothes. (390)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>17. 'But without clinging to these things, to food, to bed and chair, to water for taking away the dirt of his clothes, let a Bhikkhu be like a waterdrop on a lotus. (391)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>18. 'A householder's work I will also tell you, how a S&acirc;vaka is to act to be a good one; for that complete Bhikkhu-dhamma cannot be carried out by one who is taken up by (worldly) occupations. (392)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. 'Let him not kill, nor cause to be killed any living being, nor let him approve of others killing, after having refrained from hurting all creatures, both those that are strong and those that tremble in the world. (393)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>20. 'Then let the S&acirc;vaka abstain from (taking) anything in any place that has not been given (to him), knowing (it to belong to another), let him not cause any one to take, nor approve of those that take, let him avoid all (sort of) theft. (394)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>21. ' Let the wise man avoid an unchaste life as a burning heap of coals; not being able to live a life of chastity, let him not transgress with another man's wife. (395)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>22. 'Let no one speak falsely to another in the hall of justice or in the hall of the assembly, let him not cause (any one) to speak (falsely), nor approve of those that speak (falsely), let him avoid all (sort of) untruth. (396)</p> 
<p><a>p. 66</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>23. 'Let the householder who approves of this Dhamma, not give himself to intoxicating drinks; let him not cause others to drink, nor approve of those that drink, knowing it to end in madness. (397)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>24. 'For through intoxication the stupid commit sins and make other people intoxicated; let him avoid this seat of sin, this madness, this folly, delightful to the stupid. (398)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>25. 'Let him not kill any living being, let him not take what has not been given (to him), let him not speak falsely, and let him not drink intoxicating drinks, let him refrain from unchaste sexual intercourse, and let him not at night eat untimely food. (399)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>26. 'Let him not wear wreaths nor use perfumes, let him lie on a couch spread on the earth:--this they call the eightfold abstinence (uposatha), proclaimed by Buddha, who has overcome pain. (400)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>27. 'Then having with a believing mind kept abstinence (uposatha) on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and the eighth days of the half-month, and (having kept) the complete P&acirc;<i>t</i>ih&acirc;rakapakkha<sup>[1]</sup> consisting of eight parts, (401)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>28. 'And then in the morning, after having kept abstinence, let a wise man with a believing mind, gladdening the assembly of Bhikkhus with food and drink, make distributions according to his ability. (402)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>29. 'Let him dutifully maintain his parents, and practise an honourable trade; the householder who observes this strenuously goes to the gods by name, Sayampabhas.' (403)</p>
