<p>p. 85</p> <h2 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XXV.</h2> 
<p align="CENTER">THE BHIKSHU (MENDICANT).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;360.&nbsp;Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear, in the nose restraint is good, good is restraint in the tongue.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;361.&nbsp;In the body restraint is good, good is restraint in speech, in thought restraint is good, good is restraint in all things. A Bhikshu, restrained in all things, is freed from all pain.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;362.&nbsp;He who controls his hand, he who controls his feet, he who controls his speech, he who is well controlled, he who delights inwardly, who is collected, who is solitary and content, him they call Bhikshu.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;363.&nbsp;The Bhikshu who controls his mouth, who speaks wisely and calmly, who teaches the meaning and the law, his word is sweet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;364.&nbsp;He who dwells in the law, delights in the law, meditates on the law, follows the law, that Bhikshu will never fall away from the true law.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;365.&nbsp;Let him not despise what he has received,</p> 
<p>[363. On artha and dharma, see Stanislas Julien, Les Avad&acirc;nas, I, 217, note; 'Les quatre connaissances sont; 1&amp;deg; la connaissance du sens (artha); 2&amp;deg; la connaissance de la Loi (dharma); 3&amp;deg; la connaissance des explications (niroukti); 4&amp;deg; la connaissance de l'intelligence (pr&acirc;tibh&acirc;na).'</p> 
<p>364. The expression dhamm&acirc;r&acirc;mo, 'having his garden or delight (Lustgarten) in the law,' is well matched by the Brahmanic expression ek&acirc;r&acirc;ma, i.e. nirdvandva (Mah&acirc;bh. XIII, 1930). Cf. <a href="sbe1034.htm#pp_326">Suttanip&acirc;ta, v. 326</a>; <a href="sbe1004.htm#pp_32">Dhammapada, v. 32</a>.]</p> 
<p>p. 86</p> 
<p>nor ever envy others: a mendicant who envies others does not obtain peace of mind.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;366.&nbsp;A Bhikshu who, though he receives little, does not despise what he has received, even the gods will praise him, if his life is pure, and if he is not slothful.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;367.&nbsp;He who never identifies himself with name and form, and does not grieve over what is no more, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;368.&nbsp;The Bhikshu who acts with kindness, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha, will reach the quiet place (Nirv&acirc;<i>n</i>a), cessation of natural desires, and happiness.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;369.&nbsp;O Bhikshu, empty this boat! if emptied, it will go quickly; having cut off passion and hatred thou wilt go to Nirv&acirc;<i>n</i>a.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;370.&nbsp;Cut off the five (senses), leave the five, rise above the five. A Bhikshu, who has escaped from the five fetters, he is called Oghati<i>nn</i>a, 'saved from the flood.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;371.&nbsp;Meditate, O Bhikshu, and be not heedless! Do not direct thy thought to what gives pleasure that thou mayest not for thy heedlessness have to swallow the iron ball (in hell), and that thou mayest not cry out when burning, 'This is pain.'</p> 
<p>[367. N&acirc;mar&ucirc;pa is here used again in its technical sense of mind and body, neither of which, however, is with the Buddhists &acirc;tman, or 'self.' Asat, 'what is not,' may therefore mean the same as n&acirc;mar&ucirc;pa, or we may take it in the sense of what is no more, as, for instance, the beauty or youth of the body, the vigour of the mind, &amp;c.</p> 
<p>368. See Childers, Notes, p. 11.</p> 
<p>371. The swallowing of hot iron balls is considered as a punishment in hell; see <a href="sbe1024.htm#pp_308">verse 308</a>. Professor Weber has perceived the right meaning of bhavassu, which can only be bh&acirc;vayasva, but I doubt whether the rest of his rendering is right, for who would swallow an iron ball by accident?]</p> 
<p>p. 87</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;372.&nbsp;Without knowledge there is no meditation, without meditation there is no knowledge: he who has knowledge and meditation is near unto Nirv&acirc;<i>n</i>a.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;373.&nbsp;A Bhikshu who has entered his empty house, and whose mind is tranquil, feels a more than human delight when he sees the law clearly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;374.&nbsp;As soon as he has considered the origin and destruction of the elements (khandha) of the body, he finds happiness and joy which belong to those who know the immortal (Nirv&acirc;<i>n</i>a).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;375.&nbsp;And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikshu: watchfulness over the senses, contentedness, restraint under the law; keep noble friends whose life is pure, and who are not slothful.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;376.&nbsp;Let him live in charity, let him be perfect in his duties; then in the fulness of delight he will make an end of suffering.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;377.&nbsp;As the Vassika plant sheds its withered flowers, men should shed passion and hatred, O ye Bhikshus!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;378.&nbsp;The Bhikshu whose body and tongue and mind are quieted, who is collected, and has rejected the baits of the world, he is called quiet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;379.&nbsp;Rouse thyself by thyself, examine thyself by thyself, thus self-protected and attentive wilt thou live happily, O Bhikshu!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;380.&nbsp;For self is the lord of self, self is the refuge of self; therefore curb thyself as the merchant curbs a good horse.</p> 
<p>[372. Cf. Beal, Catena, p. 247.</p> 
<p>375. Cf. <a href="sbe1034.htm#pp_337">Suttanip&acirc;ta, v. 337</a>.]</p> 
<p>p. 88</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;381.&nbsp;The Bhikshu, full of delight, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha will reach the quiet place (Nirv&acirc;<i>n</i>a), cessation of natural desires, and happiness.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;382.&nbsp;He who, even as a young Bhikshu, applies himself to the doctrine of Buddha, brightens up this world, like the moon when free from clouds.</p> 
<p>[381. See <a href="#pp_368">verse 368</a>. D'Alwis translates, 'dissolution of the sa<u>n</u>kh&acirc;ras (elements of existence).']</p>
