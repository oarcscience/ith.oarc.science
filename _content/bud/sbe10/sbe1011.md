## Chapter IX.

Evil.

   116. If a man would hasten towards the good, he should keep his
thought away from evil; if a man does what is good slothfully, his mind
delights in evil.

   117. If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again; let him not
delight in sin: pain is the outcome of evil.

   118. If a man does what is good, let him do it again; let him delight
in it: happiness is the outcome of good.

   119. Even an evil-doer sees happiness as long as his evil deed has
not ripened; but when his evil deed has ripened, then does the evil-doer
see evil.

   120. Even a good man sees evil days, as long as his good deed has not
ripened; but when his good deed has ripened, then does the good man see
happy days.

   121. Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart, It will
not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is
filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even if he gather it little by
little.

   122. Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, It will
not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is
filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he gather it little
by little.

   123. Let a man avoid evil deeds, as a merchant, if he has few
companions and carries much wealth,

p\. 35

avoids a dangerous road; as a man who loves life avoids poison.

   124. He who has no wound on his hand, may touch poison with his hand;
poison does not affect one who has no wound; nor is there evil for one
who does not commit evil.

   125. If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent person, the evil
falls back upon that fool, like light dust thrown up against the wind.

   126. Some people are born again; evil-doers go to hell; righteous
people go to heaven; those who are free from all worldly desires attain
Nirvâ*n*a.

   127. Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter
into the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole
world where death could not overcome (the mortal).

   128. Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter
into the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole
world where death could not overcome (the mortal).

\[125. Cf. [Suttanipâta, v. 661](sbe1035.htm#pp_661); Indische Sprüche,
1582; Kathâsaritsâgara, 49, 222.

126\. For a description of hell and its long, yet not endless
sufferings, see Buddhaghosha's Parables, p. 132. The pleasures of
heaven, too, are frequently described in these Parables and elsewhere.
Buddha himself enjoyed these pleasures of heaven, before he was born for
the last time. It is probably when good and evil deeds are equally
balanced, that men are born again as human beings; this, at least, is
the opinion of the *G*ainas. Cf. Chintâma*n*i, ed. H. Bower, Introd. p.
xv.

127\. Cf. [St. Luke xii. 2](../../bib/kjv/luk.htm#12:2), 'For there is
nothing covered that shall not be revealed;' and [Psalm cxxxix.
8-12](../../bib/kjv/psa.htm#89:8).\]
