<p><hr></p> <h2 align="CENTER">1. K&Acirc;MASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>Sensual pleasures are to be avoided.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. If he who desires sensual pleasures is successful, he certainly becomes glad-minded, having obtained what a mortal wishes for. (766)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. But if those sensual pleasures fail the person who desires and wishes (for them), he will suffer, pierced by the arrow (of pain). (767)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. He who avoids sensual pleasures as (he would avoid treading upon) the head of a snake with his foot, such a one, being thoughtful (sato), will conquer this desire. (768)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. He who covets extensively (such) pleasures (as these), fields, goods, or gold, cows and horses, servants, women, relations, (769)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. Sins will overpower him, dangers will crush him, and pain will follow him as water (pours into) a broken ship. (770)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. Therefore let one always be thoughtful, and avoid pleasures; having abandoned them, let him cross the stream, after baling out the ship, and go to the other shore. (771)</p>

<p><hr></p> <h2 align="CENTER">2. GUHA<i>TTH</i>AKASUTTA.</h2> <blockquote>Let no one cling to existence and sensual pleasures.</blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. A man that lives adhering to the cave (i.e. the body), who is covered with much (sin), and sunk into delusion, such a one is far from seclusion, for the sensual pleasures in the world are not easy to abandon. (772)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Those whose wishes are their motives, those who are linked to the pleasures of the world, they are difficult to liberate, for they cannot be liberated by others, looking for what is after or what is before, coveting these and former sensual pleasures. (773)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. Those who are greedy of, given to, and infatuated by sensual pleasures, those who are niggardly, they, having entered upon what is wicked, wail when they are subjected to pain, saying: 'What will become of us, when we die away from here?' (774)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. Therefore let a man here<sup>[1]</sup> learn, whatever he knows as wicked in the world, let him not for the sake of that (?) practise (what is) wicked<sup>[2]</sup>; for short is this life, say the wise. (775)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. I see in the world this trembling race given to desire for existences; they are wretched men who lament in the mouth of death, not being free from the desire for reiterated existences. (776)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. Look upon those men trembling in selfishness, like fish in a stream nearly dried up, with little water; seeing this, let one wander about unselfish, without forming any attachment to existences. (777)</p>

<p><a>p. 148</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. Having subdued his wish for both ends<sup>[1]</sup>, having fully understood touch without being greedy, not doing what he has himself blamed, the wise (man) does not cling to what is seen and heard<sup>[2]</sup>. (778)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. Having understood name<sup>[3]</sup>, let the Muni cross over the stream, not defiled by any grasping; having pulled out the arrow (of passion), wandering about strenuous, he does not wish for this world or the other. (779)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. Verily, some wicked-minded people censure, and also just-minded people censure, but the Muni does not undergo the censure that has arisen; therefore there is not a discontented (khila) Muni anywhere. (780)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. How can he who is led by his wishes and possessed by his inclinations overcome his own (false) view? Doing his own doings let him talk according to his understanding<sup>[4]</sup>. (781)</p>

<p>his own virtue and (holy) works to others, him the good call ignoble, one who praises himself<sup>[1]</sup>. (782)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. But the Bhikkhu who is calm and of a happy mind, thus not praising himself for his virtues, him the good call noble, one for whom there are no desires anywhere in the world<sup>[2]</sup>. (783)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. He whose Dhammas are (arbitrarily) formed and fabricated, placed in front, and confused, because he sees in himself a good result, is therefore given to (the view which is called) kuppa-pa<i>t</i>i<i>kk</i>a-santi<sup>[3]</sup>. (?) (784)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. For the dogmas of philosophy are not easy to overcome, amongst the Dhammas (now this and now that) is adopted after consideration; therefore a man rejects and adopts (now this and now that) Dhamma amongst the dogmas<sup>[4]</sup>. (785)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. For him who has shaken off (sin) there is nowhere in the world any prejudiced view of the different existences; he who has shaken off (sin), after leaving deceit and arrogance behind, which (way) should he go, he (is) independent<sup>[6]</sup>. (786)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. But he who is dependent undergoes censure amongst the Dhammas; with what (name) and how should one name him who is independent? For by him there is nothing grasped or rejected, he has in this world shaken off every (philosophical) view<sup>[1]</sup>. (787)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. I see a pure, most excellent, sound man, by his views a man's purification takes place, holding this opinion, and having seen this view to be the highest he goes back to knowledge, thinking to see what is pure<sup>[2]</sup>. (788)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. If a man's purification takes place by (his philosophical) views, or he by knowledge leaves pain behind, then he is purified by another (way than the ariyamagga, i.e. the noble way), together with his upadhis, on account of his views he tells him to say so<sup>[3]</sup>.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. But the Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a who does not cling to what has been seen, or heard, to virtue and (holy) works, or to what has been thought, to what is good and to what is evil, and who leaves behind what has been grasped, without doing anything in this world, he does not acknowledge that purification cornes from another<sup>[1]</sup>. (790)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. Having left (their) former (teacher) they go to another, following their desires they do not break asunder their ties; they grasp, they let go like a monkey letting go the branch (just) after having caught (hold of it). (791)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. Having himself undertaken some (holy) works he goes to various (things) led by his senses, but a man of great understanding, a wise man who by his wisdom has understood the Dhamma, does not go to various (occupations). (792)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. He being secluded amongst all the Dhammas, whatever has been seen, heard, or thought--how should any one in this world be able to alter him, the seeing one, who wanders openly<sup>[2]</sup>? (793)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. They do not form (any view), they do not prefer (anything), they do not say, 'I am infinitely pure;' having cut the tied knot of attachment, they do not long for (anything) anywhere in the world. (794)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. He is a Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a that has conquered (sin)<sup>[1]</sup>; by him there is nothing embraced after knowing and seeing it; he is not affected by any kind of passion; there is nothing grasped by him as the highest in this world. (795)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. Because he sees in himself a good result, with regard to what has been seen (or) heard, virtue and (holy) works, or what has been thought, therefore, having embraced that, he looks upon everything else as bad<sup>[3]</sup>. (797)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. Let him not form any (philosophical) view in this world, either by knowledge or by virtue and (holy) works, let him not represent himself equal (to others), nor think himself either low or distinguished. (799)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. Having left what has been grasped, not seizing upon anything he does not depend even on knowledge. He does not associate with those that are taken up by different things, he does not return to any (philosophical) view<sup>[2]</sup>. (800)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. For whom there is here no desire for both ends, for reiterated existence either here or in another world, for him there are no resting-places (of the mind) embraced after investigation amongst the doctrines (dhammesu)<sup>[3]</sup>. (801)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. For a Bhikkhu, who wanders about unattached and cultivates the mind of a recluse, they say it is proper that he does not show himself (again) in existence<sup>[2]</sup>. (810)</p>

<p>the (only) expert (saying), '(He) who understands this, he knows the Dhamma; he who reviles this, he is not perfect<sup>[1]</sup>.' (878)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. So having got into contest they dispute: 'The opponent (is) a fool, an ignorant (person),' so they say. Which one of these, pray, is the true doctrine (v&acirc;da)? for all these assert themselves (to be the only) expert. (879)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. He who does not acknowledge an opponent's doctrine (dhamma), he is a fool, a beast, one of poor understanding, all are fools with a very poor understanding; all these abide by their (own) views. (880)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. They are surely purified by their own view, they are of a pure understanding, expert, thoughtful, amongst them there is no one of poor understanding, their view is quite perfect! (881)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>5. I do not say, 'This is the reality,' which fools say mutually to each other; they made their own views the truth, therefore they hold others to be fools. (882)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. What some say is the truth, the reality, that others say is void, false, so having disagreed they dispute. Why do not the Sama<i>n</i>as say one (and the same thing)? (883)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. For the truth is one, there is not a second, about which one intelligent man might dispute with another intelligent man; (but) they themselves praise different truths, therefore the Sama<i>n</i>as do not say one and the same thing)<sup>[2]</sup>. (884)</p>

<p><a>p. 169</a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. Why do the disputants that assert themselves (to be the only) expert, proclaim different truths? Have many different truths been heard of, or do they (only) follow (their own) reasoning? (885)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. There are not many different truths in the world, no eternal ones except consciousness; but having reasoned on the (philosophical) views they proclaim a double Dhamma, truth and falsehood<sup>[1]</sup>. (886)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. In regard to what has been seen, or heard, virtue and (holy) works, or what has been thought, and on account of these (views) looking (upon others) with contempt, standing in (their) resolutions joyful, they say that the opponent is a fool and an ignorant person<sup>[2]</sup> (?) (887)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. Because he holds another (to be) a fool, therefore he calls himself expert, in his own opinion he is one that tells what is propitious, others he blames, so he said<sup>[3]</sup>. (?) (888)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. He is full of his overbearing (philosophical) view, mad with pride, thinking himself perfect, he is in his own opinion anointed with the spirit (of genius), for his (philosopbical) view is quite complete. (889)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. If he according to another's report is low, then (he says) the other is also of a low understanding, and if he himself is accomplished and wise, there is not any fool amongst the Sama<i>n</i>as<sup>[1]</sup>. (890)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. 'Those who preach a doctrine (dhamma) different from this, fall short of purity and are imperfect,' so the Titthiyas say repeatedly, for they are inflamed by passion for their own (philosophical) views. (891)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. Here they maintain purity, in other doctrines (dhamma) they do not allow purity; so the Titthiyas, entering extensively (upon details), say that in their own way there is something firm. (892)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>16. And saying that there is something firm in his own way he holds his opponent to be a fool; thus he himself brings on strife, calling his opponent a fool and impure (asuddhadhamma). (893)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>17. Standing in (his) resolution, having himself measured (teachers, &amp;c.), he still more enters into dispute in the world; but having left all resolutions nobody will excite strife in the world<sup>[2]</sup>. (894)</p> <i>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>1. Those who abiding in the (philosophical) views dispute, saying, 'This is the truth,' they all incur blame, and they also obtain praise in this matter. (895)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>2. This is little, not enough to (bring about) tranquillity, I say there are two fruits of dispute; having seen this let no one dispute, understanding Khema (i.e. Nibb&acirc;na) to be the place where there is no dispute. (896)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>3. The opinions that have arisen amongst people, all these the wise man does not embrace; he is independent. Should he who is not pleased with what has been seen and heard resort to dependency<sup>[1]</sup>? (?) (897)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>4. Those who consider virtue the highest of all, say that purity is associated with restraint; having taken upon themselves a (holy) work they serve. Let us learn in this (view), then, his (the Master's) purity; wishing for existence they assert themselves to be the only expert<sup>[2]</sup>. (898)</p>

<p>prays for purity in this world, as one who has lost his caravan or wandered away from his house. (899)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>6. Having left virtue and (holy) works altogether, and both wrong and blameless work, not praying for purity or impurity, he wanders abstaining (from both purity and impurity), without having embraced peace. (900)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>7. By means of penance, or anything disliked, or what has been seen, or heard, or thought, going upwards they wail for what is pure, without being free from desire for reiterated existence. (901)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>8. For him who wishes (for something there always are) desires<sup>[1]</sup>, and trembling in (the midst of his) plans; he for whom there is no death and no re-birth, how can he tremble or desire anything? (902)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>9. What some call the highest Dhamma, that others again call wretched; which one of these, pray, is the true doctrine (v&acirc;da)? for all these assert themselves (to be the only) expert. (903)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>10. Their own Dhamma they say is perfect, another's Dhamma again they say is wretched; so having disagreed they dispute, they each say their own opinions (are) the truth. (904)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>11. If one (becomes) low by another's censure, then there will be no one distinguished amongst the Dhammas; for they all say another's Dhamma (is) low, in their own they say there is something firm<sup>[2]</sup>. (905)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>12. The worshipping of their own Dhamma is as great as their praise of their own ways; all schools would be in the same case, for their purity is individual<sup>[1]</sup>. (906)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>13. There is nothing about a Br&acirc;hma<i>n</i>a dependent upon others, nothing amongst the Dhammas which he would embrace after investigation; therefore he has overcome the disputes, for he does not regard any other Dhamma as the best. (907)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>14. 'I understand, I see likewise this,' so saying, some by (their philosophical) views return to purity. If he saw purity, what then (has been effected) by another's view? Having conquered they say that purity exists by another<sup>[2]</sup>. (?) (908)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>15. A seeing man will see name and form, and having seen he will understand those (things); let him at pleasure see much or little, for the expert do not say that purity exists by that. (909)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>19. Having abandoned his former passions, not contracting new ones, not wandering according to his wishes, being no dogmatist, he is delivered from the (philosophical) views, being wise, and he does not cling to the world, neither does he blame himself. (913)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a></a>20. Being secluded amongst all the doctrines (dhamma), whatever has been seen, heard, or thought, he is a Muni who has laid down his burden and is liberated, not belonging to time (na kappiyo), not dead, not wishing for anything. So said Bhagavat. (914)</p>
