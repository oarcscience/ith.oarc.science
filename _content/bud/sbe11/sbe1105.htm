<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">THE TEVI<I>GG</I>A SUTTA.</H2>
<P>THIS is the twelfth and last Sutta in the first division of the D&icirc;gha Nik&acirc;ya, which is called the S&icirc;lakkhandha Vaggo, because the whole of its twelve Dialogues deal, from one point of view or another, with S&icirc;la, or Right Conduct.</P>
<P>There is another Sutta sometimes called by the same name, No. 21 in the Middle Fifty of the Ma<I>ggh</I>ima Nik&acirc;ya: but it has nothing, except the name, in common with the present. It is called Tevi<I>gg</I>a Sutta merely because Gotama is there described by the complimentary title of Tevi<I>gg</I>a, 'Wise in the Vedas;' and its full name is the Tevi<I>gg</I>a-va<I>kkh</I>agotta-sutta[1].</P>
<P>I have made the present translation from a text constituted from three MSS.,--my own MS. of the D&icirc;gha Nik&acirc;ya, referred to as D; the Turnour MS. of the same in the Indian Office, referred to as T; both in Sinhalese characters: and the Phayre MS. in the same place, in Burmese characters, referred to as P.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>In this book we have Right Conduct used as a sort of argumentum ad hominem for the conversion of two earnest young Br&acirc;hmans.</P>
<P>They ask which is the true path to a state of union (in the next birth) with God. After arguing, in a kind of Socratic dialogue, that on their own showing, on the</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. It may be noted, in passing, that the substance of it recurs as the Va<I>khh</I>agotta Sa<I>m</I>yutta in the Sa<I>m</I>yutta Nik&acirc;ya.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A></P>
<P>basis of facts they themselves admitted, the Br&acirc;hmans could have no real knowledge of their God, Gotama maintains that union with a God whom they admitted to be pure and holy must be unattainable by men impure and sinful and self-righteous, however great their knowledge of the Vedas. And he then lays down, not without occasional beauty of language, that system of Right Conduct, which must be the only direct way to a real union with God.</P>
<P>One would think perhaps that such a Sutta might be adapted, without very great difficulty, for use as a missionary tract, so closely does it remind us of the argument of many a sermon on the text, 'Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven!' And it is true that the Tevi<I>gg</I>&acirc;--the men of special knowledge in the three Vedas--correspond exactly in most essential particulars with the Scribes and Pharisees of the New Testament. They were the official preservers by repeating, as the Scribes were by copying, the sacred books; and they were the recognised interpreters, and the sole custodians of the traditional interpretation--which too often explained away the real meaning--of those books. It follows that as the law in both cases was included in the sacred books, it was they who, in both cases, were the real lawgivers, and practically the only lawyers. And as almost all learning was confined to, or in close connection with the sacred books, the Tevi<I>gg</I>&acirc; were the chief Pa<I>nd</I>its, as the Scribes were the 'Doctors of the Law.' Like the Pharisees, too, the Br&acirc;hmans laid claim to peculiar sanctity; and many of them in the pride of their education, their birth, and their wealth, looked down with self-righteous scorn on the masses of the people. And while, on the other hand, the Br&acirc;hmans further resembled the Scribes and Pharisees in that many of them were justly deserving of the respect in which they were held; it is only the undeserving who, in both cases, are intended to be condemned.</P>
<P>But whatever interpretation of the 'kingdom of heaven'</P>
<P><A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A></P>
<P>the reader may adopt, it must be very different from anything the Sutta can mean by 'a state of union with Brahm&acirc;.' It is not easy to say what opinion is really imputed to the young Br&acirc;hmans before their conversion. It is probably meant that they were seeking a way by which their Self should become identified, after death, with Br&acirc;hman; a way by which they could escape from the immortality of transmigration, from existence altogether as separate individuals[1]. And in holding out a hope of union with Brahm&acirc; as a result of the practice of universal love[2], the Buddha is most probably intended to mean 'a union with Brahm&acirc;' in the Buddhist sense--that is to say, a temporary companionship as a separate being with the Buddhist Brahm&acirc;, to be enjoyed by a new individual not consciously identical with its predecessor. It is just possible that the argumentum ad hominem should be extended to this part of the Sutta; and that the statement in III, 1 should be taken to mean, 'This (universal love) is the only way to that kind of union with your own Brahm&acirc; which you desire.' But such a yielding to heretical opinion at the close of his own exposition of the truth would scarcely be imputed to a Buddha.</P>
<P>Just as during the time of the early Christians, in the way which Archbishop Trench has so instructively pointed out, it was not men only who received a new birth and a new baptism, but old words and terms of common use were also infused with a new spirit; so the Indian reformer, while clothing his new system in the current phraseology, infused a different and in many cases a higher meaning into the old expressions.</P>
<P>Thus, for instance, Tevi<I>gg</I>a (Sanskrit Traividya) meant either knowledge of the Three Vedas, or as an adjective, a Br&acirc;hman possessed of that knowledge; and then, as a noun of multitude, such an assembly of those Br&acirc;hmans</P>

<P>as is described in the first sections of our Sutta. As there were many Br&acirc;hmans who had not that knowledge, the word naturally came to imply a person worthy of the respect due to special learning, and was used as a complimentary title, not very different from our Doctor. It is preserved as an epithet of Arahats in the Buddhist writings, but as meaning one possessed of the knowledge of a fundamental threefold doctrine of Buddhism, the doctrine of the impermanency, the inherent pain, and the absence of any abiding principle (any Self) in the confections or component things[1]. That is to say, the knowledge of the Vedas was replaced by a knowledge of the real character of the deceptive and evanescent phenomena by which we are encircled, and of which we form a part.</P>
<P>So also with regard to Brahm&acirc;. The name was retained, but the idea was entirely changed. The course of religious belief had passed among the Indian section of the Aryan tribes through the usual stages of animism and polytheism to a kind of pantheism peculiar to India, in which Brahman was held to be a first cause, the highest self, emotionless, infinite, absolute. As the Buddhist system was constructed without any use of the previous idea of a separate soul, or self, or ghost, or spirit, supposed to exist inside the human body, this woven chain of previous speculation had as little importance for it as theological discussions have for positivism. But Buddhism fell into what to the positivist would be the unpardonable sin--perhaps inevitable at the time and place of its youth--of continuing to express a belief in the external spirits, big and little, of the then Hindu pantheon.</P>
<P>They were preserved very much in the previous order of precedence, and were all--except M&acirc;ra, the Evil One, and his personal following, and a few others--supposed to be passably good Buddhists. They were not feared any more; they were patronized as a kind of fairies, usually beneficent,</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See <I>K</I>ulla Vagga VI, 6, 2, = <I>G</I>&acirc;taka, vol. i. p. 217; Mah&acirc;va<I>m</I>sa, p. 79; D&icirc;pava<I>m</I>sa XV, 80 (where the Arahats are women); and on 'confections' below, in the Introduction to the 'Book of the Great King of Glory.']</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A></P>
<P>though always more or less foolish and ignorant. They were of course not worshipped any more, for they were much less worthy of reverence than any wise and good man. And they were not eternal,--all of them, even the very best or highest, being liable, like all things and all other creatures, to dissolution. If they had behaved well they were then reborn under happy outward conditions, and might even look forward to being some day born as men, so that they could attain to the supreme goal of the Buddhist faith, to that bliss which passeth not away,--the Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a of a perfect life in Arahatship.</P>
<P>The duty of a Buddhist who had entered the Noble Path towards these light and airy shapes--for to such vain things had the great gods fallen--was the same as his duty towards every fellow creature; pity for his ignorance, sympathy with his weakness, equanimity (the absence of fear or malice, or the sense of any differing or opposing interest), and the constant feeling of a deep and lasting love, all pervading, grown great, and beyond measure.</P>
<P>No exception was made in the case of Brahm&acirc;. He, like every other creature that had life, was evanescent, was bound by the chain of existence, the result of ignorance, and could only find salvation by walking along the Noble Eightfold Path. It must be remembered that the Brahm&acirc; of modern times, the God of the ardent theism of some of the best of the later Hindus, had not then come into existence: that conception was one effect of the influence of Mohammadan and Christian thought upon Hindu minds. And it would be useless to conjecture how the Buddhist theory might have been modified by contact with that ideal.</P>
<P>While regarded however as essentially of the same class as all other external spirits, Brahm&acirc; was still regarded as a superior spirit, as a very devout Buddhist, and as a kind of king among the angels. The Brahm&acirc; of this world system, who was living in Gotama's time, and who is living now, acquired his present exalted position from his virtue in a previous birth as a Bhikkhu named Sahaka</P>
<P><A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A></P>
<P>in the time when Kassapa Buddha's religion flourished upon earth[1]. According to the author of the <I>G</I>&acirc;taka commentary, he assisted at the future Buddha's birth[2]; and twice afterwards he rendered service to the Bodisat just before the great conflict with M&acirc;ra[3]. And when after the victory the Blessed One hesitated whether it would be of any use to tell to others the truth he had found, it was Brahm&acirc; who appeared and besought him to proclaim the truth[4] . Brahm&acirc; Sahampati was the first to give utterance to the universal sorrow which followed on the death of the Buddha[5]; and at a critical period in the later history of the Buddhist church he is represented to have descended from heaven, and to have appeared to the Thera S&acirc;<I>lh</I>a, to confirm his wavering faith[6].</P>
<P>These instances will show the high character ascribed to the Brahm&acirc; of the world system in which we live; and in each of the infinite world systems which are scattered through space there is supposed to be a like finite, temporary, virtuous Brahm&acirc; sitting as king over the most exalted of the angel hosts.</P>
<P>It must be evident that it follows, without the possibility of question, that the early Buddhists cannot with any accuracy be described as 'monotheists,' and it is much to be regretted that even cultured and scholarly writers still speak of them as such, and can suggest that the independent monotheism of the later Jews can be paralleled by a supposed monotheism among the Buddhists[7].</P>
<P>And even if the idea of Brahm&acirc; were at all the same as the idea of God, a union with this Brahm&acirc; would mean a merely temporary life as an angel in the Brahm&acirc; heaven--such a life as is represented below to have been the result</P>

<P>of the noble life and noble thoughts of the Great King of Glory. But this was not the supreme goal of the Buddhist faith; and the angel, though the same person as the king, from the Buddhist point of view (as resulting from, and carrying on, the same Karma), would be a different person from the king, according to the Christian point of view; for there is no mention of the passage of a soul from the earth to heaven, no conscious identity, no continuing memory.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>We may draw, from the above, two conclusions. Firstly, that the use of a word in Sanskrit authors is but very little guide to the meaning of the corresponding word in the P&acirc;li Buddhist scriptures whenever the word has reference to an idea of a religious character.</P>
<P>And, secondly, that very little reliance can be placed, without careful investigation, on a resemblance--however close at first sight-between a passage in the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas and a passage in the New Testament.</P>
<P>It is true that many passages in these two literatures can be easily shown to have a similar tendency. But when some writers on the basis of such similarities proceed to argue that there must have been some historical connection between the two, and that the New Testament, as the later, must be the borrower, I venture to think that they are wrong. There does not seem to me to be the slightest evidence of any historical connection between them; and whenever the resemblance is a real one--and it often turns out to be really least when it first seems to be greatest, and really greatest when it first seems least--it is due, not to any borrowing on the one side or on the other, but solely to the similarity of the conditions under which the two movements grew.</P>
<P>This does not of course apply to the later literature of the two religions; and it ought not to detract from the very great value and interest of the parallels which may be adduced from the earlier books. If we wish to understand what it was that gave such life and force to the stupendous movement which is called Buddhism, we</P>
<P><A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A></P>
<P>cannot refrain from comparing it--not only in the points in which it agrees with it, but also in the points in which it differs from it--with our own faith. I trust I have not been wrong in making use occasionally of this method, though the absence of any historical connection between the New Testament and the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas has always seemed to me so clear, that it would be unnecessary to mention it. But when a reviewer who has been kind enough to appreciate, I am afraid too highly, what he calls my 'service in giving, for the first time, a thoroughly human, acceptable, and coherent' account of the 'life of Buddha,' and of the 'simple groundwork of his religion' has gone on to conclude that the parallels I had thus adduced are 'an unanswerable indication of the obligations of the New Testament to Buddhism,' I must ask to be allowed to enter a protest against an inference which seems to me to be against the rules of sound historical criticism.</P>

<P>1. This have I heard. At one time when the Blessed One was journeying through Kosala with a great company of the brethren, with about five hundred brethren, he came to the Br&acirc;hman village in Kosala which is called Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a. And there at Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a the Blessed One stayed in the mango grove, on the bank of the river A<I>k</I>iravat&icirc;, to the south of Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a [1].</P>
<P>2. Now at that time many very distinguished and wealthy Br&acirc;hmans were staying at Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a--to wit, <I>K</I>a<U>n</U>k&icirc; the Br&acirc;hman, T&acirc;rukkha the Br&acirc;hman, Pokkharas&acirc;ti the Br&acirc;hman, G&acirc;<I>n</I>usso<I>n</I>i the Br&acirc;hman, Todeyya the Br&acirc;hman, and other very distinguished and wealthy Br&acirc;hmans[2].</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Burnouf, in a long note at 'Lotus,' &amp;c., p. 491, already attempted to show that the river A<I>k</I>iravat&icirc; is the same as the modern Rapti, which he supposed to be a corruption of the latter part of the longer name. Hiouen Thsang mentions a river A-chi-lo-fa-ti, which is doubtless the same. It is evidently the river on which stood the town of S&acirc;vatthi, and near to which lay the <I>G</I>etavana monastery (see 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 331); and it must therefore, in accordance with Burnouf's conjecture, be the Rapti, which is the Sanskrit Ir&acirc;vati. The Phayre Burmese MS. has almost always A<I>k</I>&icirc;ravat&icirc;.</P>
<P>2 Buddhaghosa says that</P><DIR>

<I>G</I>&acirc;nusso<I>n</I>i lived at S&acirc;vatthi, and<BR>
Todeyya lived at Tudig&acirc;ma.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>There is some difference in the MSS. as to the spelling of these names: T. reads <I>K</I>a<U>n</U>k&icirc;; P. T. and D. Pokkharas&acirc;ti (Sanskrit Paushkaras&acirc;di); P. <I>G</I>&acirc;nuyoni, T. <I>G</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>uso<I>n</I>i, D. <I>G</I>&acirc;nusoni; P. Toreyya, and Burnouf Nodeyya (which is possibly merely a misreading). G&acirc;<I>n</I>uso<I>n</I>i was converted by the Bhaya-bherava Sutta, and I think it very probable that the other names are also those of subsequent converts.</P>
<P>Buddhaghosa adds that because Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a was a pleasant place the Br&acirc;hmans had built huts there on the bank of the river and fenced them in, and used to go and stay there from time to time to repeat their mantras.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A></P>
<P>3. Now a conversation sprung up between V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a and Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a, when they were taking exercise (after their bath) and walking up and down in thoughtful mood, as to which was the true path, and which the false[1].</P>
<P>4. The young Br&acirc;hman V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a spake thus:</P>
<P>'This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahm&acirc;[2]--I mean that which has been announced by the Br&acirc;hman Pokkaras&acirc;ti.'</P>
<P>5. The young Br&acirc;hman Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a spake thus:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. <I>G</I>a<U>n</U>gh&acirc;vih&acirc;ra<I>m</I> anu<I>k</I>a<U>n</U>kamant&acirc;na<I>m</I> anuvi<I>k</I>arant&acirc;na<I>m</I>. On the first word see <I>G</I>&acirc;taka II, 2 7 2 (and comp. I 1, 2 40). <I>K</I>ankamati is to walk up and down thinking. I have added 'after their bath' from Buddhaghosa, who says that this must be understood to have taken place when, after learning by heart and repeating all day, they went down in the evening to the river-side to bathe, and then walked up and down on the sand.</P>
<P>2. Brahma-sahavyat&acirc;ya. The first part of the compound is masculine (see below, § 12), but the Buddhists probably included under the name, when put into the mouth of Br&acirc;hmans, all that the Brahmans included under both Brahm&acirc; and Br&acirc;hman. The Buddhist archangel or god Brahm&acirc; is different from both, being part of an entirely different system of thought.]</P>

<P>'This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahm&acirc;--I mean that which has been announced by the Br&acirc;hman T&acirc;rukkha.'</P>
<P>6. But neither was the young Br&acirc;hman V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a able to convince the young Br&acirc;hman Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a, nor was the young Br&acirc;hman Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;ga able to convince the young Br&acirc;hman V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a.</P>
<P>7. Then the young Br&acirc;hman V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a said to the young Br&acirc;hman Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a:</P>
<P>'That Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama, Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a, of the Sakya clan, who left the Sakya tribe to adopt the religious life, is now staying at Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a, in the mango grove, on the bank of the river A<I>k</I>iravat&icirc;, to the south of Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a. Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad, that he is said to be "a fully enlightened one, blessed and worthy, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the world, unsurpassed as a guide to erring mortals, a teacher of gods and men, a blessed Buddha[1]." Come, then, Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;ga, let us go to the place where the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama is; and when we have come there, let us ask the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama touching this matter. What the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama shall declare unto us, that let us bear in mind.'</P>
<P>'Very well, my friend!' said the young Br&acirc;hman Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a, in assent, to the young Br&acirc;hman V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------------------</P>
<P>8. Then the young Br&acirc;hman V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a and the young Br&acirc;hman Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;<I>g</I>a went on to the place where the Blessed One was.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See below, § 46.]</P>
</FONT><P><A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A></P>
<P>And when they had come there, they exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and compliments of friendship and civility, and sat down beside him.</P>
<P>And while they were thus seated the young Br&acirc;hman V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P>'As we, Gotama, were taking exercise and walking up and down, there sprung up a conversation between us on which was the true path and which the false. I said thus:</P>
<P>'"This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahm&acirc;--I mean that which has been announced by the Br&acirc;hman Pokkaras&acirc;ti."</P>

<P>'"This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahm&acirc;--I mean that which has been announced by the Br&acirc;hman T&acirc;rukkha."</P>
<P>'Regarding this matter, Gotama, there is a strife, a dispute, a difference of opinion between us.'</P>

<P>'Just, Gotama, as near a village or a town there are many and various paths[3], yet they all meet together in the village--just in that way are all the various paths taught by various Br&acirc;hmans-the Addhariya Br&acirc;hmans, the Tittiriya Br&acirc;hmans, the <I>Kh</I>andoka Br&acirc;hmans, the <I>Kh</I>andava Br&acirc;hmans, the Brahma<I>k</I>ariya Br&acirc;hmans.

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Samatittik&acirc; k&acirc;kapeyy&acirc;, a stock phrase used of a river in flood time. Buddhaghosa says, Samatittik&acirc; ti samaharit&acirc; (sic ? sam&acirc;harit&acirc;): k&acirc;kapeyy&acirc; ti yatthakattha<I>k</I>i t&icirc;re <I>th</I>itena k&acirc;kena sakk&acirc; p&acirc;tun ti k&acirc;kapeyy&acirc;, which does not seem to me to solve the question as to the origin and history of these difficult terms. With respect to the right form of samatittik&acirc; it should be noticed that the northern Buddhist spelling is samat&icirc;rthak&acirc; (Sukhavat&icirc;vy&ucirc;ha, ed. Max M&uuml;ller in J. R. A. S. for 1880, p. 182), and that both Childers and Oldenberg have read samatitthik&acirc; in the Burmese MSS. of Mah&acirc;parinibb&acirc;na Sutta I, 33 = Mah&acirc; Vagga VI, 28. Now the difference in Burmese letters between tt and tth (### and ###) is so very small that the copyists frequently write one for the other; and even in good MSS. where the two are not confounded, it is sometimes difficult to tell which is really meant. When talking of rivers the mention of titthas seems so appropriate {footnote p. 179} that a copyist, and especially a Burmese copyist, would naturally read a doubtful combination as tth; so that even if all Burmese MSS. spell this word with tth (which is by no means certain), very little reliance should be placed upon the fact. On the other hand, the distinction in Sinhalese between tt and tth is very marked (### and ###) and the Sinhalese MSS. all read tt. I think therefore that Childers was right in finally adopting samatittik&acirc; as the correct P&acirc;li form. In the numerous words in which Buddhist Sanskrit has a form differing in a way which sets philological rules at defiance from the corresponding P&acirc;li form, Childers thought (see Dict. p. xi, where the list of words might be greatly extended) that the Sanskrit was always derived from the P&acirc;li, and the Sanskrit writers had merely blundered. I venture, with great diffidence, to doubt this. It seems more likely that, at least in many instances, both P&acirc;li and Sanskrit were alike derived from a previous Pr&acirc;krit form, and that in differently interpreting a difficult word, both Sanskrit and P&acirc;li authors made mistakes. That may be the case here; and it is almost certain that the original word had nothing to do with t&icirc;rtha. How easily this idea could be adopted we see from the fact that Childers when first editing the MSS. (in the J. R. A. S. for 1874), and when he had only Sinhalese MSS. then before him, altered their reading into samatitthik&acirc;, and put this form into his Dictionary; though he afterwards (in the separate edition), and after noting that reading in the Phayre MS., chose the other. But what, after all, does 'having equal or level t&icirc;rthas or landing-places' mean, when spoken of a river? Comp. Samatittika<I>m</I> bhu<I>&ntilde;g</I>&acirc;mi (Mil. 213, 214); Sabbato titta<I>m</I> pokkhara<I>n</I>i<I>m</I> (<I>G</I>&acirc;t. I, 339, text tittha<I>m</I>); and Samatittiko telapatto (ibid. 393, text ºiyo, but see p. 400). The root perhaps is TR<I>I</I>P.</P>
<P>K&acirc;kapeyya, according to Buddhaghosa, would mean 'crow-drinkable.' Crows do not drink on the wing; and they could stand to drink either when a river actually overflowed its banks and formed shallows on the adjoining land; or when in the hot season it had formed shallows in its own bed. 'Crow-drinkable' might mean therefore just as well 'shallow' as 'overflowing.' Had the word originally anything to do with k&acirc;ka after all?]</P>

<P>ask him, who never till that time had left Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a, which was the way to Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a. Would that man, born and brought up in Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a, be in any doubt or difficulty?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Gotama! And why? If the man had been born and brought up in Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a, every road that leads to Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a would be perfectly familiar to him.'</P>
<P>43. 'That man, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a, born and brought up at Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a might, if he were asked the way to Manas&acirc;ka<I>t</I>a, fall into doubt and difficulty, but to the Tath&acirc;gata, when asked touching the path which leads to the world of Brahm&acirc;, there can be neither doubt nor difficulty. For Brahm&acirc;, I know, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a, and the world of Brahm&acirc;, and the path which leadeth unto it. Yea, I know it even as one who has entered the Brahma world, and has been born within it!'</P>

<P>44. When he had thus spoken, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a the young Br&acirc;hman said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P>'So has it been told me, Gotama, even that the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama knows the way to a state of union with Brahm&acirc;. It is well! Let the venerable Gotama be pleased to show us the way to a state of union with Brahma, let the venerable Gotama save the Br&acirc;hman race!'</P>

The truth doth he proclaim both in its letter and in its spirit, lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation: the higher life doth he make known, in all its purity and in all its perfectness.</P>
<P>47. 'A householder (gahapati), or one of his children, or a man of inferior birth in any class, listens to that truth[2]. On hearing the truth he has faith in the Tath&acirc;gata, and when he has acquired that faith he thus considers with himself:</P>

<P>48. 'Then before long, forsaking his portion of wealth, be it great or be it small; forsaking his circle of relatives, be they many or be they few, he cuts off his hair and beard, he clothes himself in the orange-coloured robes, and he goes forth from the household life into the homeless state.</P>
<P>49. 'When he has thus become a recluse he passes a life self-restrained according to the rules of the P&acirc;timokkha; uprightness is his delight, and he sees danger in the least of those things he should avoid; he adopts and trains himself in the precepts; he encompasses himself with holiness in word and deed; he sustains his life by means that are quite pure; good is his conduct, guarded the door of his senses; mindful and self-possessed, he is altogether happy[1]!'</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The argument is resumed after the Three S&icirc;las, or Descriptions of Conduct--a text, doubtless older than the Suttas in which it occurs, setting forth the distinguishing moral characteristics of a member of the Order.</P>
<P>The First S&icirc;la is an expansion of the Ten Precepts ('Buddhism,' p. 160), but omitting the fifth, against the use of intoxicating drinks. The Second S&icirc;la is a further expansion of the first and then of the last four, and finally of the fourth Precept. The Third S&icirc;la is directed against auguries, divinations, prophecies, astrology, quackery, ritualism, and the worship of Gods (including Brahm&acirc;).</P>
<P>These Three S&icirc;las may perhaps have been inserted in the Sutta as a kind of counterpoise to the Three Vedas. Our Sutta really reads better without them; but they are interesting in themselves, and the third is especially valuable as evidence of ancient customs and beliefs.]</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This paragraph occurs frequently; see, inter alia, below, Mah&acirc;-Sudassana Sutta II, 8. It will be seen from 'Buddhism,' pp. 170, 171, that these meditations play a great part in later Buddhism, and occupy very much the place that prayer takes in Christianity. A fifth, the meditation on Impurity, has been added, at what time I do not know, before the last. All five are practised in Siam (Alabaster, 'Wheel of the Law,' p. 168).]</P>

<P>'He will not, Gotama!'</P>
<P>'Will he be full of anger, or free from anger?'</P>
<P>'He will be free from anger, Gotama!'</P>
<P>'Will his mind be full of malice, or free from malice?'</P>
<P>'Free from malice, Gotama!'</P>
<P>'Will his mind be sinful, or pure?'</P>
<P>'It will be pure, Gotama!'</P>
<P>'Will he have self-mastery, or will he not?'</P>
<P>'Surely he will, Gotama!'</P>
<P>6. 'Then you say, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a, that the Bhikkhu is free from household cares, and that Brahm&acirc; is free from household cares. Is there then agreement and likeness between the Bhikkhu and Brahm&acirc;?'</P>
<P>'There is, Gotama!'</P>
<P>7. 'Very good, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a. Then in sooth, V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a, that the Bhikkhu who is free from household cares should after death, when the body is dissolved, become united with Brahm&acirc;, who is the same--such a condition of things is every way possible!</P>

<P>9. When he had thus spoken, the young Brahmans V&acirc;se<I>tth</I>a and Bh&acirc;radv&acirc;ga addressed the Blessed One, and said:</P>
<P>'Most excellent, Lord, are the words of thy mouth, most excellent! just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a lamp into the darkness, so that those who have eyes can see external forms;--just even so, Lord, has the truth been made known to us, in many a figure, by the Blessed One. And we, even we, betake ourselves, Lord, to the Blessed One as our refuge, to the Truth, and to the Brotherhood. May the Blessed One accept us as disciples, as true believers, from this day forth, as long as life endures!'</P>
