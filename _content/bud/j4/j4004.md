*"Behold yon man," etc.*—This story the Master told at Kapilavatthu, in
the Banyan Park, about smiling.

\[7\] At that time they say that the Master, wandering afoot with his
band of Brethren in the Banyan Park at evening time, at a certain spot
gave a smile. Said Elder Ānanda, "What can be the cause, what the
reason, that the Blessed One should smile? Not without cause do the
Tathāgatas smile. I will ask him, then." So with a gesture of obeisance
he asked of this smile. Then the Master said to him, "In days of yore,
Ānanda, there was a certain sage, named Kaṇha, who on this spot of earth
lived, meditative, in meditation his delight; and by power of his virtue
Sakka's abode was shaken." But as this speech about the smile was not
quite clear, at the Elder's request he told this story of the past.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta ruled in Benares, there was a certain
childless Brahmin, having wealth to the amount of eighty crores, who
took upon him the vows of virtue, and prayed for a son; in the womb of
this brahmin's wife was conceived the Bodhisatta, and from his black
colour they gave him on his nameday the name of Kaṇha-kumāra, young
Blackie. He at the age of sixteen years, being full of splendour, as it
were an image of some precious stone, was sent by his father to
Takkasilā, where he learnt all the liberal arts, and returned again.
Then his father provided a wife meet for him. And by and bye he came in
for all his parents' property.

Now one day, after inspecting his treasure houses, as he sat on his
gorgeous divan, he took in his hand a golden plate, and reading upon the
golden plate these lines inscribed by his kinsmen of former days, "So
much of the property gained by such an one, so much by another," thought
he, "Those who won this wealth are seen no more, but the wealth is still
seen; not one of them could take it where he is gone; we cannot tie our
wealth in a bundle and take it with us to the next world. Seeing that it
is connected with the Five Sins, to distribute in alms this vain wealth
is the better part; seeing that this vain body is connected with much
disease, to show honour and kindness to the virtuous is the better part;
seeing that this transient and vain life is but transient, to strive
after spiritual insight is the better part. Therefore these vain
treasures I will distribute in alms, that by so doing I may gain the
better part." So he uprose from his seat, and having asked the king's
consent, he gave alms bounteously.

Up to the seventh day \[8\] seeing no diminution in his wealth, he
thought, "What is wealth to me? While I am yet unmastered by old age, I
will even now take the ascetic vow, I will cultivate the Faculties and
the Attainments, I will become destined for Brahma's heaven!" So he
caused all the doors of his dwelling to be set open, and bade them take
it all as freely given; and spurning it as a thing unclean, he forsook
all desire of the eyes, and amid the lamentations and tears of a great
multitude, went forth from the city, even unto the Himalaya region.
There he embraced the solitary life; and seeking out for a pleasant
place to dwell in, he found this place, and there he resolved to dwell;
and choosing a gourd tree for his place of feeding, there he did abide,
and lived at the root of that tree; lodging never within a village he
became a dweller in the woods, never a hut of leaves he made, but abode
at the foot of this tree, in the open air, sitting ever, or if he
desired to lie, lying upon the ground, not a pestle but only teeth to
grind his food with, eating only things uncooked by the fire, and never
even a grain in the husk passed his lips, eating once in the day, and at
one sitting. On the ground, as though he were one with <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4) the four elements, he lived,

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

taking upon him the ascetic virtues <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5).
In that Birth the Bodhisatta, as we learn, had very few wants.

Thus ere long he attained the Faculties and the Attainments, and lived
in that spot in the ecstasy of ecstatic meditation. For wild fruits he
went no further afield; when fruit grew upon the tree, he ate the fruit;
in time of flowers, he ate flowers; when the leaves grew, he ate leaves;
when leaves there were none, he ate the bark of trees. Thus in the
highest contentment he lived a long time in that place. As in the
morning he used to pick up the fruits of that tree, never once even did
he from greediness rise up and pick fruit in any other place. In the
place where he sat, he stretched out his hand, and gathered all the
fruit there was within the handsweep; these he would eat as they came,
making no distinction between nice and nasty. As he continued to take
pleasure in this, by the power of his virtue the yellowstone throne of
Sakka grew hot. (This throne, they say, grows hot when Sakka's life
draws towards its end, or when his merit is exhausted and worked out,
\[9\] or when some mighty Being prays, or through the efficacy of virtue
in priests or brahmins full of potency <span
id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6).)

Then Sakka thought, "Who is it would dislodge me now?" Surveying all
around, he saw, living in a forest, in a certain spot, the sage Kanha,
picking up fruit, and knew that yonder was the sage of dread austerity,
all sense subdued; "To him will I go," thought he, "I will cause him to
proclaim the Law in trumpet tones, and having heard the preaching that
gives peace, I will satisfy him with a boon, and make his tree bear
fruit unceasingly, and then I will return hither." Then by his mighty
power quickly descending, and taking his stand at the root of that tree
behind the sage, he said, by way of testing whether or no the sage would
be angry at mention of his ugliness, the first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Behold yon man, all black of hue, that dwells on this black spot,  
Black is the meat that he doth eat—my spirit likes him not!"

</div>

Swart Kaṇha heard him. "Who is it speaks to me?—" by his divine insight
he perceived that it was Sakka; and without turning, replied with the
second stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Though black of hue, a brahmin true at heart, O Sakka, see:  
Not by the skin, but if he sin, then black a man must be."

</div>

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

And then, after this, having explained in their several kinds and blamed
the sins which make black such beings, and praised the goodness of
virtue, \[10\] he discoursed to Sakka, and it was as though he made the
moon to rise in the sky. Sakka at the hearing of his discourse, charmed
and delighted, offered the Great Being a boon, and repeated the third
stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Fair spoken, Brahmin, nobly put, most excellently said:  
Choose what you will—as bids your heart, so let your choice be made."

</div>

Hearing this the Great Being thought thus within himself. "I know how it
must be. He wished to test me, and see should I be wroth at mention of
my ugliness; therefore he abused the colour of my skin, my food, my
place of dwelling; perceiving that I was not angry, he is pleased, and
offers me a boon; no doubt he thinks that I practise this manner of life
through a desire for the power of Sakka or of Brahma; and now, to make
him certain, I must choose these four boons: that I may be calm, that I
may have within me no hatred or malice against my neighbour, and that I
may have no greed for my neighbour's glory or lust towards my
neighbour." Thus pondering, to resolve the doubt of Sakka, the sage
uttered the fourth stanza, claiming these four boons:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Sakka, the lord of all the world, a choice of blessings gave.  
From malice, hatred, covetise, deliverance I would have,  
And to be free from every lust: these blessings four I crave."

</div>

\[11\] Hereupon thought Sakka: "The sage Kaṇha, in choosing his boon,
has chosen four most blameless blessings. Now I will ask him what is
good or bad with these four things." And he asked the question by
repeating the fifth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"In lust, in hatred, covetise, in malice, brahmin, say  
What evil thing dost thou behold? this answer me, I pray."

</div>

"Hear then," replied the Great Being, and gave utterance to four
stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Because hatred, of ill-will bred, aye grows from small to great,  
Is ever full of bitterness, therefore I want no hate.

"’Tis ever thus with wicked men: first word, then touch we see,  
Next fist, then staff, and last of all the swordstroke flashing free:  
Where malice is, there follows hate—no malice then for me.

"When men make speed egged on by greed, fraud and deceit arise,  
And swift pursuit of savage loot—therefore, no covetise.

"Firm are the fetters bound by lust, that thrives abundantly  
Within the heart, for bitter smart—no lusting then for me."

</div>

\[13\] Sakka, his questions thus solved, replied, "Wise Kaṇha, by you
sweetly are my questions answered, with a Buddha's skill; well pleased

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

with you am I; now choose another boon" : and he repeated the tenth
stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Fair spoken, brahmin, nobly put, most excellently said:  
Choose what you will—as bids your heart, so let your choice be made."

</div>

Instantly the Bodhisatta repeated a stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"O Sakka, lord of all the world, a boon thou didst me cry.  
Where in the woods I ever dwell, where all alone dwell I,  
Grant no disease may mar my peace, or break my ecstasy."

</div>

On hearing this, thought Sakka, "Wise Kaṇha, in choosing a boon, chooses
no thing connected with food; all he chooses bears upon the ascetic
life." Delighted ever more and more, he added thereto yet another boon
and recited another stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Fair spoken, brahmin, nobly put, most excellently said:  
Choose what you will—as bids your heart, so let your choice be made."

</div>

And the Bodhisatta, in stating of his boon, declared the law in the
concluding stanza:

\[14\]<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"0 Sakka, lord of all the world, a choice thou bidst declare:  
No creature be aught harmed for me, O Sakka, anywhere,  
Neither in body nor in mind: this, Sakka, is my prayer <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7)."

</div>

Thus the Great Being, on six occasions making choice of a boon, chose
only that which pertained to the life of Renunciation. Well knew he that
the body is diseased, and not Sakka can do away the disease of it; not
with Sakka lies it to cleanse living beings in the Three Gates <span
id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8); albeit so, he made his choice to the end
that he might declare the law to him. And Sakka made that tree bear
fruit perennially, and saluting him by touching his head with joined
hands <span id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9), he said, "Dwell here ever free
from disease," and went to his own place. But the Bodhisatta, never
breaking his ecstasy, became destined for Brahma's world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This lesson ended, the Master said, "This, Ānanda, is the place where I
dwelt aforetime," and thus identified the Birth: "At that time Anuruddha
was Sakka, and for myself, I was Kaṇha the Wise."
