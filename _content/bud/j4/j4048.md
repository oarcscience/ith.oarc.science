\[276\] *"The crop of rice," etc.*—This was a story the Master told
while dwelling at Jetavana, about a Brother who supported his mother.
The occasion will be explained in the Sāma Birth <span
id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_255). Then the Master sent for this Brother,
and asked him, "Is what I hear true, Brother, that you support lay
folks?" "It is true, Sir." "Who are they?" "My mother and father, Sir."
Said the Master, "Well done, Brother! Wise men of old, even when
embodied as the lower animals, having been born as parrots even, when
their parents grew old laid them in a nest and fed them with food which
they brought in their own beaks." So saying, he told a story of the
past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time, a king named King Magadha reigned in Rājagaha. At that
time there stood a brahmin village, named Sālindiya, towards the
north-east as you go out of the city. In this north-eastern district was
property belonging to Magadha. There was a brahmin who lived in
Sālindiya, whose name was Kosiyagotta <span
id="fr_264"></span>[2](#fn_256), and he held an estate of one thousand
acres <span id="fr_265"></span>[3](#fn_257), where he grew rice. When
the crop was standing, he made a stout fence, and gave the land in
charge to his own men, to one fifty acres, to another sixty, and so he
distributed among them some five hundred acres of his estate. \[277\]
The other five hundred he delivered to a hired man for a wage, and the
man made a hut there and dwelt there day and night. Now to the
north-east of this estate was a certain great wood of silk-cotton
trees <span id="fr_266"></span>[4](#fn_258), growing upon the flat top
of a hill, and in this wood lived a great number of parrots.

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

At that time the Bodhisatta was born among this flock of parrots, as the
son of the king of the parrots. He grew up handsome and strong, big his
body was as the nave of a cart-wheel. His father now grown old said to
him, "I am able no longer to go far afield; do you take care of this
flock," and committed the lordship of it to his son. From the next day
onwards he refused to permit his parents to go foraging; but with the
whole flock away he flew to the Himalaya hills, and after eating his
fill of the clumps of rice that grew wild there, on his return brought
food sufficient for his mother and father, and fed them with it.

One day the parrots asked him a question. "Formerly," they said, "the
rice was ripe by this time on the Magadha farm; is it grown now or not?"
"Go and see," he replied, and then sent two parrots to find out. The
parrots departed, and alighted in the Magadha lands, in that part which
was guarded by the hired man; rice they ate, and one head of rice they
took back with them to their wood, and dropt it before the Great Being's
feet, saying, "Such is the rice which grows there." He went next day to
the farm, and alighted, with all his flock. The man ran this way and
that, trying to drive off the birds, but drive them away he could not.
The rest of the parrots ate, and departed with empty beaks; but the
parrot king gathered together a quantity of rice, and brought it back to
his parents. Next day the parrots ate the rice there again, and so
afterwards. Then the man began to think, \[278\] "If these creatures go
on eating for another few days, there will not be a bit left. The
brahmin will have a price put on the rice, and fine me in the sum. I
will go tell him." Taking a handful of rice, and a gift with it, he went
to see the brahmin, and greeted him, and stood on one side. "Well, my
good man," said the master, "is there a good crop of rice?" "Yes,
brahmin, there is," he replied, and repeated two stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The crop of rice is very nice, but I would have you know,  
The parrots are devouring it, I cannot make them go.

"There is one bird, of all the herd the finest, who first feeds,  
Then takes a bundle in his beak to meet his future needs."

</div>

When the brahmin heard this, he conceived an affection for the parrot
king. "My man," quoth he, "do you know how to set a snare?" "Yes, I
know." The master then addressed him in this stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Then set a snare of horse's hair that captured he may be;  
And see thou take the bird alive and bring him here to me."

</div>

The farm watchman was much pleased that no price had been put upon the
rice, and no debt spoken of. He went straight and made a snare of
horsehair. Then he found out when they were like to descend that day;
and spying out the place where the parrot king alighted, next day very
early in the morning he made a cage about the size of a water-pot, and
set

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

the snare, and sat down in his hut looking for the parrots to come. The
parrot king came amidst all his flock; and he being by no means greedy,
\[279\] came down in the same place as yesterday, with his foot right in
the noose. When he found his foot fast he thought, "Now if I cry out the
cry of the captured, my kinsfolk will be so terrified, they will fly
away foodless. I must endure until they have finished their food." When
at last he perceived that they had taken their fill, being in fear of
his life, he thrice cried the cry of the captured. All the birds flew
off. Then the king of the parrots said, "All these my kith and kin, and
not one to look back at me! What sin have I done?" And upbraiding them
he uttered a stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"They ate, they drank, and now away they hasten every one,  
I only caught within a snare: what evil have I done?"

</div>

The watchman heard the cry of the parrot king, and the sound of the
other parrots flying through the air. "What is that?" thought he. Up he
got from his hut, and went to the place of his snare, and there he saw
the king of the parrots. "The very bird I set the snare for is caught!"
he cried, in high delight. He took the parrot out of the snare, and tied
both his feet together, and making his way to Sālindiya village, he
delivered the bird to the brahmin. The brahmin in his strong affection
for the Great Being, caught hold of him tight in both hands, and seating
him on his hip, bespoke him in these two stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The bellies of all others are outbellied far by you:  
First a full meal, then off you fly with a good beak-full too

"Have you a granary there to fill? or do you hate me sore?  
I ask it you, come tell me true—where do you put your store?

</div>

On hearing this, the parrot king answered, repeating in a human voice
sweet as honey the seventh stanza:

\[280\] <span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"I hate thee not, O Kosiya! no granary I own;  
Once in my wood I pay a debt, and also grant a loan,  
And there I store a treasure up: so be my answer known."

</div>

Then the brahmin asked him:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"What is that loan the which you grant? what is the debt you pay?  
Tell me the treasure you store up, and then fly free away."

</div>

To this request of the brahmin the parrot king made reply, explaining
his intent in four stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"My callow chicks, my tender brood, whose wings are still ungrown,  
Who shall support me by and bye: to them I grant the loan.

"Then my old ancient parents, who far from youth's bounds are set,  
With that within my beak I bring, to them I pay my debt.

"And other birds of helpless wing, and weak full many more,  
To these I give in charity: this sages call my store.

"This is that loan the which I grant, this is the debt I pay,  
And this the treasure I store up: now I have said my say."

</div>

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

The brahmin was pleased when he heard this pious discourse from the
Great Being; and he repeated two stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"What noble principles of life! how blessed is this bird!  
From many men who live on earth such rules are never heard.

\[281\] "Eat, eat your fill whereas you will, with all your kindred
too;  
And, parrot! let us meet-again: I love the sight of you."

</div>

With these words, he looked upon the Great Being with a soft heart, as
though it were his liefest son; and loosing the bonds from his feet, he
rubbed them with oil an hundred times refined, and seated him on a seat
of honour, and gave him to eat sweetened corn upon a golden dish, and
gave him sugar-water to drink. After this the king of the parrots warned
the brahmin to be careful, reciting this stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"O Kosiya! within thy dwelling here  
I had both food and drink and friendship dear.  
Give thou to those whose burden is laid down,  
Support thy parents when they old are grown."

</div>

The brahmin then delighted in heart uttered his ecstasy in this stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Surely Luck's goddess came herself to-day  
    When I set eyes upon this peerless bird!  
I will do kindly deeds and never stay,  
    Now that the parrot's sweet voice I have heard."

</div>

But the Great Being refused to accept the thousand acres which the
brahmin offered him, but took only eight acres. The brahmin set up
boundary stones, and made over this property to him; and then, raising
his hands to his head in reverence, he said, "Go in peace, my lord, and
console your weeping parents," and then let him go. Much pleased, he
took a head of rice, and carried it to his parents, and dropt it before
them, saying, "Arise now, my dear parents!" They arose at his word, with
blubbered faces. \[282\] Then flocks of parrots began together, asking,"
How did you get free, my lord?" He told them the whole story from
beginning to end. And Kosiya followed <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_259) the advice of the king of the parrots,
and distributed much alms to the righteous men, and ascetics, and
brahmins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last stanza was repeated by the Master explaining this:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"This Kosiya with joy and great delight  
    Common and plentiful made drink and food:  
With food and drink he satisfied aright  
    Brahmins and holy men, himself all good."

</div>

When the Master had ended this discourse, he said, "Thus, Brethren, to
support one's parents is the traditional way of the wise and good."
Then, having declared the Truths, he identified the Birth:—(now at the
conclusion of the Truths that Brother became established in the fruit of
the First Path:)—"At that time the Buddha's followers were the flock of
parrots, two of the king's family were the father and mother, Channa was
the watchman, Ānanda the brahmin, and I was myself the king of the
parrots."
