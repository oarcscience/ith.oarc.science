<p>Bodhisattva having subdued M&acirc;ra, his firmly fixed mind at rest, thoroughly exhausting the first principle of truth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he entered into deep and subtle contemplation, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1111</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Self-contained. Every kind of S&acirc;madhi in order passed before his eyes. During the first watch he entered on 'right perception&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,' and in recollection all former births passed before his eyes; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1112</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Born in such a place, of such a name, and downwards to his present birth, so through hundreds, thousands, myriads, all his births and deaths he knew; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1113</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Countless in number were they, of every kind and sort; then knowing, too, his family relationships, great pity rose within his heart. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1114</FONT></span></p>  
<p>This sense of deep compassion passed, he once again considered 'all that lives,' and how they moved within the six&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_405"></A><A HREF="#fn_405"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> portions of life's revolution, no final term to birth and death; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1115</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Hollow all, and false and transient (unfixed) as the plantain tree, or as a dream, or phantasy. Then in the middle watch of night, he reached to knowledge (eyes) of the pure Devas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_406"></A><A HREF="#fn_406"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1116</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And beheld before him every creature, as one sees images upon a mirror; all creatures born and born again to die, noble and mean, the poor and rich, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1117</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Reaping the fruit of right or evil doing, and sharing happiness or misery in consequence. First he considered and distinguished evil-doers (works), that such must ever reap an evil birth; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1118</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then he considered those who practise righteous deeds, that these must gain a place with men or gods; but those again born in the nether hells, (he saw) participating in every kind of misery; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1119</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Swallowing (drinking) molten brass (metal), the iron skewers piercing their bodies, confined within the boiling caldron, driven and made to enter the fiery oven (dwelling), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1120</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Food for hungry, long-toothed dogs, or preyed upon by brain-devouring birds; dismayed by fire, then (they wander through) thick woods, with leaves like razors gashing their limbs, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1121</FONT></span></p>  
<p>While knives divide their (writhing) bodies, or hatchets lop their members, bit by bit; drinking the bitterest poisons, their fate yet holds them back from death. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1122</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus those who found their joy in evil deeds, he saw receiving now their direst sorrow; a momentary taste of pleasure here, a dreary length of suffering there; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1123</FONT></span></p>  
<p>A laugh or joke because of others' pain, a crying</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A></p>  
<p>out and weeping now at punishment received. Surely if living creatures saw the consequence of all their evils deeds, self-visited, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1124</FONT></span></p>  
<p>With hatred would they turn and leave them, fearing the ruin following--the blood and death. He saw, moreover, all the fruits of birth as beasts, each deed entailing its own return, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1125</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(And) when death ensues born in some other form (beast shape), different in kind according to the deeds. Some doomed to die for the sake of skin or flesh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_407"></A><A HREF="#fn_407"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, some for their horns or hair or bones or wings, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1126</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Others torn or killed in mutual conflict, friend or relative before, contending thus; (some) burthened with loads or dragging heavy weights, (others) pierced and urged on by pricking goads, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1127</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Blood flowing down their tortured forms, parched and hungry--no relief afforded; then, turning round, (he saw) one with the other struggling, possessed of no independent strength; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1128</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Flying through air or sunk in deep water, yet no place as a refuge left from death. He saw, moreover, those, misers and covetous, born now as hungry ghosts, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1129</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Vast bodies like the towering mountain, with mouths as small as any needle-tube, hungry and thirsty, nought but fire and poison&#8217;d flame to enwrap their burning forms within. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1130</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Covetous, they would not give to those who sought, or duped the man who gave in charity, now born among the famished ghosts, they seek for food, but cannot find withal. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1131</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The refuse of the unclean man they fain would</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A></p>  
<p>eat, but this is changed and lost (before it can be eaten); oh! if a man believes that covetousness is thus repaid, as in their case, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1132</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Would he not give his very flesh in charity even as <I>S</I>ivi r&acirc;<I>g</I>a did! Then, once more (he saw), those reborn as men, with bodies like some foul sewer, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1133</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Ever moving &#8217;midst the direst sufferings, born from the womb to fear and trembling, with body tender, touching anything its feelings painful, as if cut with knives; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1134</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Whilst born in this condition, no moment free from chance of death, labour, and sorrow, yet seeking birth again, and being born again, enduring pain. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1135</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then (he saw those who) by a higher merit were enjoying heaven; a thirst for love ever consuming them, their merit ended with the end of life, the five signs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_408"></A><A HREF="#fn_408"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> warning them of death (their beauty fades), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1136</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Just as the blossom that decays, withering away, is robbed of all its shining tints; not all their associates, living still, though grieving, can avail to save the rest; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1137</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The palaces and joyous precincts empty now, the Dev&icirc;s all alone and desolate, sitting or asleep upon the dusty earth, weep bitterly in recollection of their loves; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1138</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Those who are born, sad in decay; those who are dead, belov&eacute;d, cause of grief; thus ever struggling on, preparing future pain, covetous they seek the joys of heaven, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1139</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Obtaining which, these sorrows come apace; despicable joys! oh, who would covet them! using such mighty efforts (means) to obtain, and yet unable thence to banish pain. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1140</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Alas, alas! these Devas, too, alike deceived--no difference is there! thro&#8217; lapse of ages bearing suffering, striving to crush desire and lust, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1141</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Now certainly expecting long reprieve, and yet once more destined to fall! in hell enduring every kind of pain, as beasts tearing and killing one the other, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1142</FONT></span></p>  
<p>As Pretas parched with direst thirst, as men worn out, seeking enjoyment; although, they say, when born in heaven, 'then we shall escape these greater ills,' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1143</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Deceived, alas! no single place exempt, in every birth incessant pain! Alas! the sea of birth and death revolving thus--an ever-whirling wheel--1144</p>  
<p>All flesh immersed within its waves cast here and there without reliance! thus with his pure Deva eyes he thoughtfully considered the five domains of life. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1145</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He saw that all was empty and vain alike! with no dependence! like the plantain or the bubble. Then, on the third eventful watch, he entered on the deep, true&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_409"></A><A HREF="#fn_409"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> apprehension&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_410"></A><A HREF="#fn_410"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1146</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He meditated on the entire world of creatures, whirling in life's tangle, born&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_411"></A><A HREF="#fn_411"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to sorrow; the crowds who live, grow old, and die, innumerable for multitude, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1147</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Covetous, lustful, ignorant, darkly-fettered, with no way known for final rescue. Rightly considering, inwardly he reflected from what source birth and death proceed; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1148</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He was assured that age and death must come from birth as from a source. For since a man has born with him a body, that body must inherit pain (disease). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1149</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then looking further whence comes birth, he saw it came from life-deeds done elsewhere; then with his Deva-eyes scanning these deeds, he saw they were not framed by I<I>s</I>vara; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1150</FONT></span></p>  
<p>They were not self-caused, they were not personal existences, nor were they either uncaused; then, as one who breaks the first bamboo joint finds all the rest easy to separate, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1151</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Having discerned the cause of birth and death, he gradually came to see the truth; deeds come from up&acirc;d&acirc;na (cleaving), like as fire which catches hold of grass; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1152</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Up&acirc;d&acirc;na (tsu) comes from t<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>&acirc; (&#8217;ngai), just as a little fire enflames the mountains; t<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>&acirc; comes from vedan&acirc; (shau), (the perception of pain and pleasure, the desire for rest); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1153</FONT></span></p>  
<p>As the starving or the thirsty man seeks food and drink, so 'sensation' (perception) brings 'desire' for life; then contact (spar<I>s</I>a) is the cause of all sensation, producing the three kinds of pain or pleasure, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1154</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Even as by art of man the rubbing wood produces fire for any use or purpose; spar<I>s</I>a (contact) is born from the six entrances (&acirc;yatanas)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_412"></A><A HREF="#fn_412"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A></p>  
<p>(a man is blind because he cannot see the light)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_413"></A><A HREF="#fn_413"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1155</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The six entrances are caused by name and thing, just as the germ grows to the stem and leaf; name and thing are born from knowledge (vi<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>ana), as the seed which germinates and brings forth leaves. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1156</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Knowledge, in turn, proceeds from name and thing, the two are intervolved leaving no remnant; by some concurrent cause knowledge engenders name and thing, whilst by some other cause concurrent, name and thing engender knowledge; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1157</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Just as a man and ship advance together, the water and the land mutually involved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_414"></A><A HREF="#fn_414"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; thus knowledge brings forth name and thing; name and thing produce the roots (&acirc;yatanas); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1158</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The roots engender contact; contact again brings forth sensation; sensation brings forth longing desire; longing desire produces up&acirc;d&acirc;na; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1159</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Up&acirc;d&acirc;na is the cause of deeds; and these again engender birth; birth again produces age and death; so does this one incessant round <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1160</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Cause the existence of all living things. Rightly illumined, thoroughly perceiving this, firmly established, thus was he enlightened; destroy birth, old age and death will cease; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1161</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Destroy bhava then will birth cease; destroy 'cleaving' (up&acirc;d&acirc;na) then will bhava end; destroy t<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>&acirc; (desire) then will cleaving end; destroy sensation then will t<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>&acirc; end; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1162</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Destroy contact then will end sensation; destroy the six entrances, then will contact cease; the six entrances all destroyed, from this, moreover, names and things will cease; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1163</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Knowledge destroyed, names and things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_415"></A><A HREF="#fn_415"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> will cease; sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ra (names and, things) destroyed, then knowledge perishes; ignorance destroyed, then the sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_416"></A><A HREF="#fn_416"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> will die; the great <I>Ri</I>shi was thus perfected in wisdom (sambodhi). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1164</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus perfected, Buddha then devised for the world's benefit the eightfold path, right sight, and so on, the only true path for the world to tread. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1165</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus did he complete the end (destruction) of 'self,' as fire goes out for want of grass; thus he had done what he would have men do; he first had found the way of perfect knowledge; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1166</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He finished thus the first great lesson (param&acirc;rtha); entering the great <I>Ri</I>shi's house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_417"></A><A HREF="#fn_417"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the darkness disappeared; light coming on, perfectly silent, all at rest, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1167</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He reached at last the exhaustless source of truth (dharma); lustrous with all wisdom the great <I>Ri</I>shi sat, perfect in gifts, whilst one convulsive throe shook the wide earth. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1168</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And now the world was calm again and bright, when Devas, N&acirc;gas, spirits, all assembled, amidst the void raise heavenly music, and make their offerings as the law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_418"></A><A HREF="#fn_418"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> directs; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1169</FONT></span></p>  
<p>A gentle cooling breeze sprang up around, and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A></p>  
<p>from the sky a fragrant rain distilled; exquisite flowers, not seasonable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_419"></A><A HREF="#fn_419"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, bloomed; sweet fruits before their time were ripened; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1170</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Great Mand&acirc;ras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_420"></A><A HREF="#fn_420"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and every sort of heavenly precious flower, from space in rich confusion fell, as tribute&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_421"></A><A HREF="#fn_421"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to the illustrious monk. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1171</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Creatures of every different kind were moved one towards the other lovingly; fear and terror altogether put away, none entertained a hateful thought; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1172</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And all things living in the world with faultless men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_422"></A><A HREF="#fn_422"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> consorted freely; the Devas giving up their heavenly joys, sought rather to alleviate the sinner's sufferings; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1173</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Pain and distress grew less and less, the moon of wisdom waxed apace; whilst all the <I>Ri</I>shis of the Ikshv&acirc;ku clan who had received a heavenly birth, 1174.</p>  
<p>Beholding Buddha thus benefitting men, were filled with joy and satisfaction; and whilst throughout the heavenly mansions religious offerings fell as raining flowers, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1175</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The Devas and the N&acirc;ga spirits&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_423"></A><A HREF="#fn_423"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, with one voice, praised the Buddha's virtues; men seeing the religious offerings, hearing, too, the joyous hymn of praise, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1176</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Were all rejoiced in turn; they leapt for unrestrained</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A></p>  
<p>joy; M&acirc;ra, the Devar&acirc;<I>g</I>a, only, felt in his heart great anguish. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1177</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Buddha for those seven days, in contemplation lost, his heart at peace, beheld and pondered on the Bodhi tree, with gaze unmoved and never wearying: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1178</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Now resting here, in this condition, I have obtained,' he said, 'my ever-shifting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_424"></A><A HREF="#fn_424"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>heart's desire, and now at rest I stand, escaped from self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_425"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' The eyes of Buddha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_426"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> then considered 'all that lives,' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1179</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And forthwith rose there in him deep compassion; much he desired to bring about their welfare (purity), but how to gain for them that most excellent deliverance, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1180</FONT></span></p>  
<p>From covetous desire, hatred, ignorance, and false. teaching (this was the question); how to suppress this sinful heart by right direction; not by anxious use . of outward means, but by resting quietly in thoughtful silence. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1181</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Now looking back and thinking of his mighty vow, there rose once more within his mind a wish to preach the law; and looking carefully throughout the world, he saw how pain and sorrow ripened and increased everywhere. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1182</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then Brahma-deva knowing his thoughts, and considering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_427"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> it right to request him to advance religion for the wider spread of the Brahma-glory, in the deliverance of all flesh from sorrow, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1183</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Coming, beheld upon the person of the reverend monk all the distinguishing marks of a great preacher, visible in an excellent degree; fixed and unmoved (he sat) in the possession of truth and wisdom, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1184</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Free from all evil impediments, with a heart cleansed from all insincerity or falsehood. Then with reverent and a joyful heart, (great Brahma stood and) with hands joined, thus made known his request: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1185</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'What happiness in all the world so great as when a loving master meets the unwise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; the world with all its occupants, filled with impurity and dire confusion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1186</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'With heavy grief oppressed, or, in some cases, lighter sorrows, (waits deliverance); the lord of men, having escaped by crossing the wide and mournful sea of birth and death, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1187</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'We now entreat to rescue others--those struggling creatures all engulphed therein; as the just worldly man, when he gets profit, gives some rebate withal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1188</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'So the lord of men enjoying such religious gain, should&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> also give somewhat to living things.

<p>'O! let your loving heart be moved with pity towards the world burthened&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> with vexing cares.'</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Thus having spoken by way of exhortation, with reverent mien he turned back to the Brahma heaven. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1190</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Buddha regarding the invitation of Brahma-deva rejoiced at heart, and his design was strengthened; greatly was his heart of pity nourished, and purposed was his mind to preach. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1191</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thinking he ought to beg some food, each of the four kings offered him a P&acirc;tra; Tath&acirc;gata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_433"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, in fealty to religion, received the four and joined them all in one. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1192</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And now some merchant men were passing by, to whom 'a virtuous friend&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,' a heavenly spirit, said: 'The great <I>Ri</I>shi, the venerable monk, is dwelling in this mountain grove, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1193</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'(Affording) in the world a noble field for merit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; go then and offer him a sacrifice!' Hearing the summons, joyfully they went, and offered the first meal religiously. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1194</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Having partaken of it, then he deeply pondered, who first should hear the law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; he thought at once of Ar&acirc;<I>d</I>a K&acirc;l&acirc;ma and Udraka R&acirc;maputra, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1195</FONT></span></p>

<p>As being fit to accept the righteous law; but now they both were dead. Then next he thought of the five men, that they were fit to hear the first sermon. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1196</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Bent then on this design to preach Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, as the sun's glory bursts thro&#8217; the darkness, so went he on towards Benares, the place where dwelt the ancient <I>Ri</I>shis; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1197</FONT></span></p>  
<p>With eyes as gentle as the ox king's, his pace as firm and even as the lion's, because he would convert the world he went on towards the K&acirc;<I>s</I>i&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> city; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1198</FONT></span></p>
