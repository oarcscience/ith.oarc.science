<p>And now those five men, A<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it, V&acirc;shpa, and the others, having heard that he (Kau<I>n</I><I>d</I>inya) 'knew' the law, with humble mien and self-subdued, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1277</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Their hands joined, offered their homage, and looked with reverence in the teacher's face. Tath&acirc;gata, by wise expedient, caused them one by one to embrace the law. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1278</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And so from first to last the five Bhikshus obtained reason and subdued their senses, like the five stars which shine in heaven, waiting upon the brightening moon. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1279</FONT></span></p>  
<p>At this time in the town of Ku-i&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_475"></A><A HREF="#fn_475"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (Ku<I>s</I>in&acirc;r&acirc;) there was a noble's son (called) Yasas; lost in night-sleep suddenly he woke, and when he saw his attendants all, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1280</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Men and women, with ill-clad bodies, sleeping, his heart was filled with loathing; reflecting on the root of sorrow, (he thought) how madly foolish men were immersed in it; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1281</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Clothing himself, and putting on his jewels, he left his home and wandered forth; then on the way he stood and cried aloud, 'Alas! alas! what endless chain of sorrows.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1282</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Tath&acirc;gata, by night, was walking forth, and hearing sounds like these, 'Alas! what sorrow,' forthwith replied, 'You are welcome! here, on the other hand, there is a place of rest, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1283</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The most excellent, refreshing, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, quiet and unmoved, free from sorrow.' Yasas hearing Buddha's exhortation, there rose much joy within his heart, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1284</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And in the place of the disgust he felt, the cooling streams of holy wisdom found their way, as when one enters first a cold pellucid lake. Advancing then, he came where Buddha was; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1285</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His person decked with common ornaments, his mind already freed from all defects; by power of the good root obtained in other births, he quickly reached the fruit of an Arhat; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1286</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The secret light of pure wisdom's virtue (li) enabled him to understand, on listening to the law; just as a pure silken fabric&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with ease is dyed a different colour; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1287</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus having attained to self-illumination, and done that which was to be done, (he was converted); then looking at his person richly ornamented, his heart was filled with shame. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1288</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Tath&acirc;gata knowing his inward thoughts, in g&acirc;thas spoke the following words: 'Tho&#8217; ornamented with jewels, the heart may yet have conquered sense; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1289</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Looking with equal mind on all that lives, (in such a case) the outward form does not affect religion; the body, too, may wear the ascetic's garb, the heart, meanwhile, be immersed in worldly thoughts; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1290</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Dwelling in lonely woods, yet covetous of worldly show, such men are after all mere worldlings; the body may have a worldly guise, the heart mount high to things celestial; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1291</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The layman and the hermit are the same, when only both have banished thought of "self," but if the heart be twined with carnal bonds, what use the marks of bodily attention? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1292</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'He who wears martial decorations, does so because by valour he has triumphed o&#8217;er an enemy,--so he who wears the hermit's colour&#8217;d robe, does so for having vanquished sorrow as his foe.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1293</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then he bade him come, and be a member of his church (a Bhikshu); and at the bidding to! his garments changed! and he stood wholly attired in hermit's dress, complete; in heart and outward look, a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1294</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Now (Yasas) had in former days some light companions, in number fifty and four; when these beheld their friend a hermit, they. too, one by one, attained true wisdom [entered the true law]; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1295</FONT></span></p>  
<p>By virtue of deeds done in former births, these deeds now bore their perfect fruit. Just as when burning ashes are sprinkled by water, the water being dried, the flame bursts forth. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1296</FONT></span></p>  
<p>So now, with those above, the <I>S</I>r&acirc;vakas (disciples) were altogether sixty, all Arhats; entirely obedient and instructed in the law of perfect discipleship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. So perfected he taught them further: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1297</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Now ye have passed the stream and reached "the other shore," across the sea of birth and death;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A></p>  
<p>what should be done, ye now have done! and ye may now receive the charity of others. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1298</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Go then through every country, convert those not yet converted; throughout the world that lies burnt up with sorrow, teach everywhere; (instruct) those lacking right instruction; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1299</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Go, therefore! each one travelling by himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; filled with compassion, go! rescue and receive. I too will go alone, back to yonder Kia-<I>k</I>e&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> mountain; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1300</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Where there are great <I>Ri</I>shis, royal <I>Ri</I>shis, Brahman <I>Ri</I>shis too, these all dwell there, influencing, men according to their schools; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1301</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The <I>Ri</I>shi K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, enduring pain, reverenced by all the country, making converts too of many, him will I visit and convert.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1302</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then the sixty Bhikshus respectfully receiving orders to preach, each according to his fore-determined purpose, following his inclination, went thro&#8217; every land; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1303</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The honour'd of the world went on alone, till he arrived at the Kia-ke mountain, then entering a retired religious dell, he came. to where the <I>Ri</I>shi K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa was. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1304</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Now this one had a 'fire grot' where he offered sacrifice, where an evil N&acirc;ga dwelt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, who wandered here and there in search of rest, through mountains and wild places of the earth. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1305</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The honoured of the world,.(wishing) to instruct this hermit and convert him, asked him, on coming, for a place to lodge that night. K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, replying, spake to Buddha thus: 'I have no resting-place to offer for the night, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1306</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Only this fire grot where I sacrifice, this is a cool and fit place for the purpose, but an evil dragon dwells there, who is accustomed, as he can, to poison men.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1307</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Buddha replied, 'Permit me only, and for the night I'll take my dwelling there,' K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa made many difficulties, but the world-honoured one still asked the favour. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1308</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa addressed Buddha, 'My mind desires no controversy, only I have my fears and apprehensions, but follow you your own good pleasure.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1309</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Buddha forthwith stepped within the fiery grot, and took his seat with dignity and deep reflection; and now the evil N&acirc;ga seeing Buddha, belched forth in rage his fiery poison, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1310</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And filled the place with burning vapour. But this could not affect the form of Buddha. Through-out the abode the fire consumed itself, the honoured of the world still sat composed: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1311</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Even as Brahma, in the midst of the kalpa-fire that burns and reaches to the Brahma heavens, still sits unmoved, without a thought of fear or apprehension, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1312</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(So Buddha sat); the evil N&acirc;ga seeing him, his face glowing with peace, and still unchanged, ceased his poisonous blast, his heart appeased; he bent his head and worshipped. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1313</FONT></span></p>  
<p>K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa in the night seeing the fire-glow, sighed;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_185"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 185</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 'Ah! alas! what misery! this most distinguished man is also burnt up by the fiery N&acirc;ga,' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1314</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa and his followers at morning light came one and all to look. Now Buddha having subdued the evil N&acirc;ga, had straightway placed him in his p&acirc;tra, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1315</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(Beholding which) and seeing the power of Buddha, K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa conceived within him deep and secret thoughts: 'This Gotama,' he thought, 'is deeply versed (in religion), but still he said, "I am a master of religion."' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1316</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then Buddha, as occasion offered, displayed all kinds of spiritual changes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, influencing his (K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa's) heart-thoughts, changing and subduing them; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1317</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Making his mind pliant and yielding, until at length prepared to be a vessel of the true law, he confessed that his poor wisdom could not compare with the complete wisdom of the world-honoured one. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1318</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And so, convinced at last, humbly submitting, he accepted right instruction. (Thus) U-pi-lo (Uravilva) K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, and five hundred of his followers <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1319</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Following their master, virtuously submissive, in turn received the teaching of the law. K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa and all his followers were thus entirely converted. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1320</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The <I>Ri</I>shi then, taking his goods and all his sacrificial vessels, threw them together in the river, which floated down upon the surface of the current. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1321</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Nadi and Gada, brothers, who dwelt adown the stream, seeing these articles of clothing (and the rest) floating along the stream disorderly, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1322</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_186"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 186</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Said, 'Some great change has happened,' and deeply pained, were restlessly (concerned). The two, each with five hundred followers, going up the stream to seek their brother, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1323</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Seeing him now dressed as a hermit, and all his followers with him, having got knowledge of the miraculous law--strange thoughts engaged their minds--&nbsp;1324</p>  
<p>'Our brother having submitted thus, we too should also follow him (they said).' Thus the three brothers, with all their band of followers, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1325</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Were brought to hear the lord's discourse on the comparison of a fire sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: (and in the discourse he taught), 'How the dark smoke of ignorance arises&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, whilst confused thoughts, like wood drilled into wood, create the fire, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1326</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Lust, anger, delusion, these are as fire produced, and these enflame and burn all living things. Thus the fire of grief and sorrow, once enkindled, ceases not to burn, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1327</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Ever giving rise to birth and death; but whilst this fire of sorrow ceases not, yet are there two kinds of fire, one that burns but has no fuel left; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1328</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'So when the heart of man has once conceived distaste for sin, this distaste removing covetous desire, covetous desire extinguished, there is rescue; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1329</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If once this rescue has been found, then with it is born sight and knowledge, by which distinguishing</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the streams of birth and death, and practising pure conduct, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1330</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All is done that should be done, and hereafter shall be no more life (bhava).' Thus the thousand Bhikshus hearing the world-honoured preach, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1331</FONT></span></p>  
<p>All defects&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_484"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> for ever done away, their minds found perfect and complete deliverance. Then Buddha for the K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapas' sakes, and for the benefit of the thousand Bhikshus, having preached, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1332</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And done all that should be done, himself with purity and wisdom and all the concourse of high qualities excellently adorned, he gave them, as in charity, rules for cleansing sense. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1333</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The great <I>Ri</I>shi, listening to reason, lost all regard for bodily austerities, and, as a man without a guide, was emptied of himself, and learned discipleship. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1334</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And now the honoured one and all his followers go forward to the royal city&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_485"></A><A HREF="#fn_485"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (R&acirc;<I>g</I>ag<I>ri</I>ha), remembering, as he did, the Magadha king, and what he heretofore had promised. 1335.</p>  
<p>The honoured one when he arrived, remained within the 'staff grove&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>;' Bimbis&acirc;ra R&acirc;<I>g</I>a hearing thereof, with all his company of courtiers, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1336</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Lords and ladies all surrounding him, came to where the master was. Then at a distance seeing Buddha seated, with humbled heart and subdued presence, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1337</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Putting off his common ornaments, descending from his chariot, forward he stepped; even as</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_188"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 188</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> <I>S</I>akra, king of gods, going to where Brahmadevar&acirc;<I>g</I>a dwells. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1338</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Bowing down at Buddha's feet, he asked him, with respect, about his health of body; Buddha in his turn, having made enquiries, begged him to be seated on one side. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1339</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then the king's mind reflected silently: 'This <I>S</I>&acirc;kya must have great controlling power, to subject to his will these K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapas who now are round him as disciples.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1340</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Buddha, knowing all thoughts, spoke thus to K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, questioning him: 'What profit have you found in giving up your fire-adoring law?' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1341</FONT></span></p>  
<p>K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa hearing Buddha's words, rising with dignity before the great assembly, bowed lowly down, and then with clasped hands and a loud voice addressing Buddha, said: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1342</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The profit I received, adoring the fire spirit, was this,--continuance in the wheel of life, birth and death with all their sorrows growing,--this service I have therefore cast away; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1343</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Diligently I persevered in fire-worship, seeking to put an end to the five desires, in return I found desires endlessly increasing, therefore have I cast off this service. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1344</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Sacrificing thus to fire with many Mantras, I did but miss (i.e. I did not find) escape from birth; receiving birth, with it came all its sorrows, therefore I cast it off and sought for rest. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1345</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I was versed, indeed, in self-affliction, my mode of worship largely adopted, and counted of all most excellent, and yet I was opposed to highest wisdom. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1346</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Therefore have I discarded it, and gone in quest</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_189"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 189</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the supreme Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a. Removing from me birth, old age, disease, and death, I sought a place of undying rest and calm. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1347</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And as I gained the knowledge of this truth, then I cast off the law of worshipping the fire (or, by fire).' The honoured-of-the-world, hearing K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa declaring his experience of truth, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1348</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Wishing to move the world throughout to conceive a heart of purity and faith, addressing K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa further, said,' Welcome! great master, welcome! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1349</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Rightly have you distinguished law from law, and well obtained the highest wisdom; now before this great assembly, pray you! exhibit your excellent endowments; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1350</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'As any rich and wealthy noble opens for view his costly treasures, causing the poor and sorrow-laden multitude to increase their forgetfulness awhile; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1351</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'(So do you now) and honour well your lord's instruction.' Forthwith in presence of the assembly, gathering up his body and entering Sam&acirc;dhi, calmly he ascended into space, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1352</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And there displayed himself, walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, emitting fiery vapour from his body, on his right and left side water and fire, not burning and not moistening him; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1353</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then clouds and rain proceeded from him, thunder with lightning shook the heaven and earth; thus he drew the world to look in adoration, with eyes undazzled as they gazed; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1354</FONT></span></p>  
<p>With different mouths, but all in language one, they magnified and praised this wondrous spectacle, then afterwards drawn by spiritual force, they came and worshipped at the master's feet, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1355</FONT></span></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_190"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 190</FONT></A></p>  
<p>(Exclaiming), 'Buddha is our great teacher! we are the honoured one's disciples! Thus having magnified his work and finished all he purposed doing, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1356</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Drawing the world as universal witness, the assembly was convinced that he, the world-honoured, was truly the 'Omniscient!' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1357</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Buddha, perceiving that the whole assembly was ready as a vessel to receive the law, spoke thus to Bimbis&acirc;ra R&acirc;<I>g</I>a: 'Listen now and understand; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1358</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The mind, the thoughts, and all the senses are subject to the law of life and death. This fault&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of birth and death, once understood, then there is clear and plain perception; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1359</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Obtaining this clear perception, then there is born knowledge of self, knowing oneself and with this knowledge laws of birth and death, then there is no grasping and no sense-perception. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1360</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Knowing oneself, and understanding how the senses act, then there is no room for "I," or ground for framing it; then all the accumulated mass of sorrow, sorrows born from life and death, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1361</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Being recognised as attributes of body, and as this body is not "I," nor offers ground for "I," then comes the great superlative (discovery), the source of peace unending; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1362</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'This thought (view) of "self" gives rise to all these sorrows, binding as with cords&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the world, but having found there is no "I" that can be bound, then all these bonds are severed. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1363</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'There are no bonds indeed--they disappear--</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_191"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 191</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and seeing this there is deliverance. The world holds to this thought of "I," and so, from this, comes false apprehension. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1364</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Of those who maintain the truth of it, some say the "I" endures, some say it perishes; taking the two extremes of birth and death, their error is most grievous! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1365</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For if they say the "I" (soul) is perishable, the fruit they strive for, too, will perish; and at some time there will be no hereafter, this is indeed a meritless deliverance. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1366</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But if they say the "I" is not to perish, then in the midst of all this life and death there is but one identity (as space), which is not born and does not die. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1367</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If this is what they call the "I," then are all things living, one--for all have this unchanging self--not perfected by any deeds, but self-perfect; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1368</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If so, if such a self it is that acts, let there be no self-mortifying conduct, the self is lord and master; what need to do that which is done? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1369</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For if this "I" is lasting and imperishable, then reason would teach it never can be changed. But now we see the marks of joy and sorrow, what room for constancy then is here? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1370</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Knowing that birth brings this deliverance then I put away all thought of sin's defilement; the whole world, everything, endures! what then becomes of this idea of rescue. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1371</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'We cannot even talk of putting self away, truth is the same as falsehood, it is not "I" that do a thing, and who, forsooth, is he that talks of "I?" <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1372</FONT></span></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_192"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 192</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'But if it is not "I" that do the thing, then there is no "I" that does it, and in the absence of these both, there is no "I" at all, in very truth. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1373</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'No doer and no knower, no lord, yet notwithstanding this, there ever lasts this birth and death, like morn and night ever recurring. But now attend to me and listen; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1374</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The senses six and their six objects united cause the six kinds of knowledge, these three (i.e. senses, objects, and resulting knowledge) united bring forth contact, then the intervolved effects of recollection (follow). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1375</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Then like the burning glass and tinder thro&#8217; the sun's power cause fire to appear, so thro&#8217; the knowledge born of sense and object, the lord (of knowledge) (self) (like the fire) is born. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1376</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The shoot springs from the seed, the seed is not the shoot, not one and yet not different, such is the birth of all that lives.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1377</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The honoured of the world preaching the truth, the equal and impartial param&acirc;rtha, thus addressed the king with all his followers. Then king Bimbis&acirc;ra filled with joy, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1378</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Removing from himself defilement, gained religious sight, a hundred thousand spirits also, hearing the words of the immortal law, shook off and lost the stain of sin. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1379</FONT></span></p>
