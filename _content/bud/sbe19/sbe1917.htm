<p>Tath&acirc;gata piously composed and silent, radiant with glory, shedding light around, with unmatched dignity advanced alone, as if surrounded by a crowd of followers. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1200</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Beside the way he encountered a young Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, whose name was Upaka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; struck&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> with the</p>

<p>deportment of the Bhikshu, he stood with reverent mien on the road side; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1201</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Joyously he gazed at such an unprecedented sight, and then, with closed hands, he spake&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as follows: 'The crowds who live around are stained with sin, without a pleasing feature, void of grace, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1202</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And the great world's heart is everywhere disturbed; but you alone, your senses all composed, with visage shining as the moon when full, seem to have quaffed the water of the immortals' stream; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1203</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The marks of beauty yours, as the great man's (Mah&acirc;purusha); the strength of wisdom, as an all-sufficient (independent) king's (samr&acirc;<I>g</I>); what you have done must have been wisely done, what then your noble tribe and who your master?' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1204</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Answering he said, 'I have no master; no honourable tribe; no point of excellence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_444"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; self-taught in this profoundest doctrine, I have arrived at superhuman wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_445"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1205</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'That which behoves the world to learn, but through the world no learner found, I now myself</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and by myself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_446"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> have learned throughout; &#8217;tis rightly called Sambodhi (<I>k</I>ing kioh); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1206</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'That hateful family of griefs the sword of wisdom has destroyed; this then is what the world has named, and rightly named, the "chiefest victory." <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1207</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Through all Benares soon will sound the drum of life, no stay is possible--I have no name&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>--nor do I seek profit or pleasure, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1208</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But simply to declare the truth; to save men (living things) from pain, and to fulfil my ancient oath, to rescue all not yet delivered. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1209</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The fruit of this my oath is ripened now, and I will follow out my ancient vow. Wealth, riches, self all given up, unnamed, I still am named "Righteous Master&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>." <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1210</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And bringing profit to the world (empire), I also have the name "Great Teacher&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>;" facing sorrows, not swallowed up by them, am I not rightly called Courageous Warrior? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1211</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If not a healer of diseases, what means the name of Good Physician? seeing the wanderer, not showing him the way, why then should I be called "Good Master-guide?" <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1212</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Like as the lamp shines in the dark, without a</p>

<p>purpose of its own, self-radiant, so burns the lamp of the Tath&acirc;gata, without the shadow of a personal feeling. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1213</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Bore wood in wood, there must be fire; the wind blows of its own free self in space; dig deep and you will come to water; this is the rule of self-causation. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1214</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All the Munis who perfect wisdom, must do so at Gay&acirc;; and in the K&acirc;<I>s</I>i country they must first turn the Wheel of Righteousness.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1215</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The young Brahman Up&acirc;ka, astonished, breathed the praise of such strange doctrine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_450"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and called to mind like thoughts he had before experienced&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; lost in thought at the wonderful occurrence, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1216</FONT></span></p>  
<p>At every turning of the road he stopped to think; embarrassed in every step he took. Tath&acirc;gata proceeding slowly onwards, came to the city of K&acirc;<I>s</I>i, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1217</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The land so excellently adorned as the palace of <I>S</I>akradevendra; the Ganges and Bara<I>n</I>&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_452"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, two twin rivers flowed amidst; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1218</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The woods and flowers and fruits so verdant, the peaceful cattle wandering together, the calm retreats</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A></p>  
<p>free from vulgar noise, such was the place where the old <I>Ri</I>shis dwelt. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1219</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Tath&acirc;gata glorious and radiant, redoubled the brightness of the place; the son of the Kau<I>n</I><I>d</I>inya tribe (Kau<I>n</I><I>d</I>inya-kulaputra), and next Da<I>s</I>abalak&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1220</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And the third V&acirc;shpa, the fourth A<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it, the fifth called Bhadra, practising austerities as hermits, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1221</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Seeing from far Tath&acirc;gata approaching, sitting together all engaged in conversation, (said), 'This Gautama, defiled by worldly indulgence, leaving the practice of austerities, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1222</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Now comes again to find us here, let us be careful not to rise in salutation, nor let us greet him when he comes, nor offer him the customary refreshments; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1223</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Because he has broken his first vow, he has no claim to hospitality;' [for men on seeing an approaching guest by rights prepare things for his present and his after wants, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1224</FONT></span></p>  
<p>They arrange a proper resting-couch, and take on themselves care for his comfort.]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Having spoken thus and so agreed, each kept his seat, resolved and fixed. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1225</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And now Tath&acirc;gata slowly approached, when, to! these men unconsciously, against their vow, rose and invited him to take a seat; offering to take his, robe and P&acirc;tra, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1226</FONT></span></p>  
<p>They begged to wash and rub his feet, and asked him what he required more; thus in everything attentive, they honour&#8217;d him and offered all to him as teacher. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1227</FONT></span></p>  
<p>They did not&nbsp;not cease however to address him</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A></p>  
<p>still as Gautama, after his family&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_454"></A><A HREF="#fn_454"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Then spake the Lord to them and said: 'Call me not after my private name, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1228</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For it is a rude and careless way of speaking to one who has obtained Arhatship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_455"></A><A HREF="#fn_455"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; but whether men respect or disrespect me, my mind is undisturbed and wholly quiet; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1229</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But you&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>--your way is not so courteous, let go, I pray, and cast away your fault. Buddha can save the world; they call him, therefore, Buddha; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1230</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Towards all living things, with equal heart he looks as children, to call him then by his familiar name is to despise a father; this is sin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1231</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus Buddha, by exercise of mighty love, in deep compassion spoke to them; but they, from ignorance and pride, despised the only wise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_458"></A><A HREF="#fn_458"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and true one's words. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1232</FONT></span></p>  
<p>They said that first he practised self-denial, but having reached thereby no profit, now giving rein to body, word, and thought&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, how by these means (they asked) has he become a Buddha? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1233</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus equally entangled by doubts, they would not credit that he had attained the way. Thoroughly versed in highest truth, full of all-embracing wisdom, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1234</FONT></span></p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Tath&acirc;gata on their account briefly declared to them the one true way; the foolish masters practising austerities, and those who love to gratify their senses, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1235</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He pointed out to them these two distinctive classes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and how both greatly erred. 'Neither of these (he said) has found the way of highest wisdom, nor are their ways of life productive of true rescue. 1236.</p>  
<p>'The emaciated devotee by suffering produces in himself confused and sickly thoughts, not conducive even to worldly knowledge, how much less to triumph over sense! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1237</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For he who tries to light a lamp with water, will not succeed in scattering the darkness, (and so the man who tries) with worn-out body to trim the lamp of wisdom shall not succeed, nor yet destroy his ignorance or folly. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1238</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Who seeks with rotten wood to evoke the fire will waste his labour and get nothing for it; but boring hard wood into hard, the man of skill forthwith gets fire for his use; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1239</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'In seeking wisdom then it is not by these austerities a man may reach the law of life. But (likewise) to indulge in pleasure is opposed to right, this is the fool's barrier against wisdom's light; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1240</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The sensualist cannot comprehend the S&ucirc;tras or the <I>S</I>&acirc;stras, how much less the way of overcoming all desire! As some man grievously afflicted eats food not fit to eat, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1241</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And so in ignorance aggravates his sickness, so</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A></p>  
<p>how can he get rid of lust who pampers lust? Scatter the fire amid the desert grass, dried by the sun, fanned by the wind, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1242</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The raging flames who shall extinguish? Such is the fire of covetousness and lust (or, hankering lust), I, then, reject both these extremes, my heart keeps in the middle way. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1243</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All sorrow at an end and finished, I rest at peace, all error put away; my true sight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_461"></A><A HREF="#fn_461"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> greater than the glory of the sun, my equal and unvarying wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_462"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, vehicle of insight, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1244</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Right words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> as it were a dwelling-place, wandering through the pleasant groves of right conduct&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, making a right life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_465"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> my recreation, walking along the right road of proper means&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_466"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1245</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'My city of refuge in right recollection&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_467"></A><A HREF="#fn_467"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, and my sleeping couch right meditation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_468"></A><A HREF="#fn_468"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>; these are the eight even and level roads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="#fn_469"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> by which to avoid the sorrows of birth and death; .1246</p>  
<p>'Those who come forth by these means from the slough, doing thus, have attained the end; such shall fall neither on this side or the other, amidst the sorrow-crowd of the two periods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_470"></A><A HREF="#fn_470"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1247</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The tangled sorrow-web of the three worlds by this road alone can be destroyed; this is my own way, unheard of before; by the pure eyes of the true law, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1248</FONT></span></p>

<p>'Impartially seeing the way of escape, I, only I, now first make known this way; thus I destroy the hateful company of T<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>&acirc;'s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_471"></A><A HREF="#fn_471"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> host, the sorrows of birth and death, old age, disease, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1249</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And all the unfruitful aims of men, and other springs of suffering. There are those who warring against desire are still influenced by desire; who whilst possessed of body, act as tho&#8217; they had none; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1250</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Who put away from themselves all sources of true merit, briefly will I recount their sorrowful lot. Like smothering a raging fire, though carefully put out, yet a spark left, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1251</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'So in their abstraction, still the germ of "I&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_472"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>," the source&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_473"></A><A HREF="#fn_473"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of great sorrow still surviving, perpetuates the suffering caused by lust (t<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>&acirc;), and the evil consequences of every kind of deed survive; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1252</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'These are the sources of further pain, but let these go and sorrow dies, even as the seed of corn taken from the earth and deprived of water dies; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1253</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The concurrent causes not uniting, then the bud and leaf cannot be born; the intricate bonds of every kind of existence, from the Deva down to the evil ways of birth, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1254</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Ever revolve and never cease; all this is produced from covetous desire; falling from a high estate to lower ones, all is the fault of previous deeds; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1255</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But destroy the seed of covetousness and the rest, then there will be no intricate binding, but all</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A></p>  
<p>effect of deeds destroyed, the various degrees of sorrow then will end for good; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1256</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Having this, then, we must inherit that; destroying this, then that is ended too; no birth, old age, disease, or death; no earth, or water, fire, or wind; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1257</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'No beginning, end, or middle; and no deceptive systems of philosophy; this is the standpoint of wise men and sages; the certain and exhausted termination, (complete Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1258</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Such do the eight right ways declare; this one expedient has no remains; that which the world sees not, engrossed by error (I declare), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1259</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I know the way to sever all these sorrow-sources; the way to end them is by right reason, meditating on these four highest truths, following and perfecting this highest wisdom. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1260</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'This is what means the "knowing" sorrow; this is to cut off the cause of all remains of being; these destroyed, then all striving, too, has ended, the eight right ways have been assayed. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1261</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'(Thus, too), the four great truths have been acquired, the eyes of the pure law completed. In these four truths, the equal (i.e. true or right) eyes not yet born, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1262</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'There is not mention made of gaining true deliverance, it is not said what must be done is done, nor that all (is finished), nor that the perfect truth has been acquired. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1263</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But now because the truth is known, then by myself is known "deliverance gained," by myself is known that "all is done," by myself is known "the highest wisdom."' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1264</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And having spoken thus respecting truth, the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A></p>  
<p>member of the Kau<I>n</I><I>d</I>inya family, and eighty thou-sand of the Deva host, were thoroughly imbued with saving knowledge; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1265</FONT></span></p>  
<p>They put away defilement from themselves, they got the eyes of the pure law; Devas and earthly masters thus were sure, that what was to be done was done. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1266</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And now with lion-voice he joyfully enquired, and asked Kau<I>n</I><I>d</I>inya, 'Knowest thou yet?' Kau<I>n</I><I>d</I>inya forthwith answered Buddha, 'I know the mighty master's law;' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1267</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And for this reason, knowing it, his name was &Acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ta Kau<I>n</I><I>d</I>inya (&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ta, known). Amongst all the disciples of Buddha, he was the very first in understanding. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1268</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then as he understood the sounds of the true law, hearing (the words of) the disciple--all the earth spirits together raised a shout triumphant, 'Well done! deeply seeing (the principles of) the law, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1269</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Tath&acirc;gata, on this auspicious day, has set revolving that which never yet revolved, and far and wide, for gods and men, has opened the gates of immortality&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_474"></A><A HREF="#fn_474"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1270</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'(Of this wheel) the spokes are the rules of pure conduct; equal contemplation, their uniformity of length; firm wisdom is the tire; modesty and thoughtfulness, the rubbers (sockets in the nave in which the axle is fixed); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1271</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Right reflection is the nave; the wheel itself the law of perfect truth; the right truth now</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>Thus the earth spirits shouted, the spirits of the air took up the strain, the Devas all joined in the hymn of praise, up to the highest Brahma heaven. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1273</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The Devas of the triple world, now hearing what the great <I>Ri</I>shi taught, in intercourse together spoke, 'The widely-honoured Buddha moves the world! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1274</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Wide-spread, for the sake of all that lives, he turns the wheel of the law of complete purity'' The stormy winds, the clouds, the mists, all disappeared; down from space the heavenly flowers descended; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1275</FONT></span></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_442"></A><A HREF="sbe1917.htm#fr_442">168:6</A> So I construe '<I>k</I>ih <I>k</I>i;' it means 'taken by,' or 'attracted by' the demeanour of the mendicant (Bhikshu). This incident is introduced as the first instance of Buddha's mendicant life and its influence on others.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_445"></A><A HREF="sbe1917.htm#fr_445">169:3</A> I have attained to that which man has not attained. That is, I have arrived at superhuman wisdom. It appears to me that this point in Buddha's history is a key to the whole system of his religion. He professes to have grasped absolute truth (the word 'absolute' corresponds with 'unfettered'); and by letting go the finite, with its limitations and defilements, to have passed into the free, boundless, unattached infinite.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_446"></A><A HREF="sbe1917.htm#fr_446">170:1</A> This assertion is a fundamental one (see Mr. Rhys Davids' Dhamma-<I>k</I>akka-ppavattana-sutta, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, throughout); so that Buddha disclaims any revelation in the sense of the result of a higher wisdom than his own. The cloud, in fact, of sin moved away, the indwelling of light, by itself, revealed itself.</P>

Report, vol. i, p. 104) says, 'The city of Benares is situated on the left bank, of the Ganges, between the Barn&acirc; Nadi on the north-east and the Asi N&acirc;la on the south-west. The Barn&acirc; is a considerable rivulet which rises to the north of Allahabad, and has a course of about 100 miles. The Asi is a mere brook of no length.'</P>
