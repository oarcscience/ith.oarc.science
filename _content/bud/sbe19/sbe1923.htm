<p>Having instructed his mother in heaven with all the angel host, and once more returned to men, he went about converting those capable of it. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1676</FONT></span></p>

<p>So also the king of Gandh&acirc;ra, whose name was Fo-kia-lo (Pudgala?); he, having heard the profound and excellent law, left his country and became a recluse. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1679</FONT></span></p>  
<p>So also the demons Himapati and V&acirc;tagiri, on the mountain Vibh&acirc;ra, were subdued and converted; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1680</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin Prayan(tika), on the mountain Va<I>g</I>ana (Po-sha-na), by the subtle meaning of half a g&acirc;tha, he convinced and caused to rejoice in faith; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1681</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The village of D&acirc;namati (Kh&acirc;numat)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_655"></A><A HREF="#fn_655"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> had one K&ucirc;tadanta, the head of the twice-born (Brahmans); at this time he was sacrificing countless victims; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1682</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Tath&acirc;gata by means (up&acirc;ya, expedients) converted him, and caused him to enter the true path. On Mount Bhatika&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_656"></A><A HREF="#fn_656"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (?) a heavenly being of eminent distinction, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1683</FONT></span></p>

<p>he converted the mother of the celebrated Nanda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_659"></A><A HREF="#fn_659"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1684</FONT></span></p>  
<p>In the town of A<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>avari (Agr&acirc;<I>t</I>av&icirc;), he subdued the powerful (mah&acirc;b&acirc;la) spirit; Bhanabhadra (patala), <I>S</I>ronadanta; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1685</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The malevolent and powerful N&acirc;gas, the king of the country and his harem, received together the true law, as he opened to them the gate of immortality (sweet dew). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1686</FONT></span></p>  
<p>In the celebrated Vi<I>g</I><I>g</I>i village (or in the village Pavi<I>g</I><I>g</I>i) Kina and Sila, earnestly seeking to be born in heaven, he converted and made to enter the right path; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1687</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The A&#7749;gulim&acirc;la&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_660"></A><A HREF="#fn_660"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, in that village of Sumu, through the exhibition of his divine power, he converted and subdued; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1688</FONT></span></p>  
<p>There was that noble's son, Puri<I>g</I>&icirc;vana, rich in wealth and stores as Punavat&icirc; (punyavat&icirc;?), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1689</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Directly he was brought to Buddha (Tath&acirc;gata) accepting the doctrine, he became vastly liberal. So in that village of Padatti he converted the celebrated Patali (or, Potali), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1690</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And also Patala, brothers, and both demons. In Bhidhavali (Pi-ti-ho-fu-li) there were two Brahmans, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1691</FONT></span></p>  
<p>One called Great-age (Mah&acirc;yus?), the other Brahma-age (Brahm&acirc;yus?). These by the power of a discourse he subdued, and caused them to attain knowledge of the true law; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1692</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_244"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 244</FONT></A></p>  
<p>When he came to Vai<I>s</I>&acirc;l&icirc;, he converted all the Raksha demons, and the lion (Si<I>m</I>ha) of the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avis, and all the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avis, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1693</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Sa<I>k</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_661"></A><A HREF="#fn_661"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the Nirgrantha, all these he caused to attain the true law. Hama kinkhava had a demon Potala, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1694</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And another Potalaka (in) Potalag&acirc;ma [these he converted]. Again he came to Mount Ala, to convert the demon Alava, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1695</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And a second called Kum&acirc;ra, and a third Asidaka; then going back to Mount Ga<I>g</I>a (Gay&acirc;s&icirc;rsha) he converted the demon Ka<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ana, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1696</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And Kamo (kin-mau) the Yaksha, with the sister and son. Then coming to Benares, he converted the celebrated Katy&acirc;yana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_662"></A><A HREF="#fn_662"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1697</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then afterwards going, by his miraculous power, to Sruvala (Sou-lu-po-lo), he converted the merchants Davakin and Nikin (?), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1698</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And received their sandal-wood hall, exhaling its fragrant odours till now. Going then to Mah&icirc;vat&icirc;, he converted the <I>Ri</I>shi Kapila, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1699</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And the Muni remained with him; his foot stepping on the stone, the thousand-spoked twin-wheels appeared, which never could be erased. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1700</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then he came to the place Po-lo-na (Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a), where he converted the demon Po-lo-na; coming to the country of Mathur&acirc;, he converted the demon Godama (Khadama?); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1701</FONT></span></p>  
<p>In the Thurakusati (? neighbourhood of Mathur&acirc;)</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_245"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 245</FONT></A></p>  
<p>he also converted Pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ap&acirc;la (or, vara); coming to the village of Vaira<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>a, he converted the Brahman; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1702</FONT></span></p>  
<p>In the village of Kalamasa (or Kramasa), he converted Savasasin, and also that celebrated A<I>g</I>irivasa. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1703</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Once more returning to the <I>S</I>r&acirc;vast&icirc; country, he converted the Gautamas <I>G</I>&acirc;tisruna and Dak&acirc;tili; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1704</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Returning to the Ko<I>s</I>ala country, he converted the leaders of the heretics Vakrapali (or, Vikravari) and all the Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1705</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Corning to Satavaka, in the forest retreat, he converted the heretical <I>Ri</I>shis, and constrained them to enter the path of the Buddha <I>Ri</I>shi. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1706</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Coming to the country of Ayodhy&acirc;, he converted the Demon N&acirc;gas; coming to the country of Kimbila, he converted the two N&acirc;gar&acirc;<I>g</I>as; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1707</FONT></span></p>  
<p>One called Kimbila, the other called K&acirc;laka. Again coming to the Va<I>g</I><I>g</I>i country, he converted the Yaksha demon, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1708</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Whose name was Pisha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_663"></A><A HREF="#fn_663"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the father and mother of N&acirc;gara, and the great noble also, he caused to believe gladly in the true law. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1709</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Corning to the Kaus&acirc;mb&icirc; country, he converted Goshira&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_664"></A><A HREF="#fn_664"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and the two Upas&icirc;k&acirc;s, Va<I>g</I>uttar&acirc; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1710</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And her companion Uvar&icirc;; and besides these, many others, one after the other. Coming to the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A></p>  
<p>country of Gandh&acirc;ra he converted the N&acirc;ga Apal&acirc;la&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_665"></A><A HREF="#fn_665"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1711</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus in due order all these air-going, water-loving natures he completely converted and saved, as the sun when he shines upon some dark and sombre cave. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1712</FONT></span></p>  
<p>At this time Devadatta,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_666"></A><A HREF="#fn_666"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, seeing the remarkable excellences of Buddha, conceived in his heart a jealous hatred; losing all power of thoughtful abstraction, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1713</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He ever plotted wicked schemes, to put a stop to the spread of the true law; ascending the G<I>ri</I>dhrak&ucirc;<I>t</I>a (Ghi<I>g</I><I>g</I>ak&ucirc;<I>t</I>a) mount he rolled down a stone to hit Buddha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_667"></A><A HREF="#fn_667"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1714</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The stone divided into two parts, each part passing on either side of him. Again, on the royal highway he loosed a drunken, vicious elephant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_668"></A><A HREF="#fn_668"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1715</FONT></span></p>  
<p>With his raised trunk trumpeting as thunder (he ran), his maddened breath raising a cloud around him, his wild pace like the rushing wind to be avoided more than the fierce tempest; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1716</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His trunk and tusks and tail and feet, when touched only, brought instant death. (Thus he ran) through the streets and ways of R&acirc;<I>g</I>ag<I>ri</I>ha, madly wounding and killing men; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1717</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Their corpses lay across the road, their brains</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_247"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 247</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and blood scattered afar. Then all the men and women filled with fear, remained indoors; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1718</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Throughout the city there was universal terror, only piteous shrieks and cries were heard; beyond the city men were running fast, hiding themselves in holes and dens. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1719</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Tath&acirc;gata, with five hundred followers, at this time came towards the city; from tops of gates and every window, men, fearing for Buddha, begged him not to advance; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1720</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Tath&acirc;gata, his heart composed and quiet, with perfect self-possession, thinking only on the sorrow caused by hate, his loving heart desiring to appease it, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1721</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Followed by guardian angel-n&acirc;gas, slowly approached the maddened elephant. The Bhikshus all deserted him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_669"></A><A HREF="#fn_669"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, &Acirc;nanda only remained by his side; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1722</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Joined by every tie of duty, his steadfast nature did not shake or quail. The drunken elephant, savage and spiteful, beholding Buddha, came to himself at once, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1723</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And bending, worshipped at his feet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_670"></A><A HREF="#fn_670"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> just as a mighty mountain falls to earth. With lotus hand the master pats his head, even as the moon lights up a flying cloud. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1724</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And now, as he lay crouched before the master's feet, on his account he speaks some sacred words: 'The elephant cannot hurt the mighty dragon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_671"></A><A HREF="#fn_671"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, hard it is to fight with such a one; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1725</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_248"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 248</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'The elephant desiring so to do will in the end obtain no happy state of birth; deceived by lust, anger, and delusion, which are hard to conquer, but which Buddha has conquered. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1726</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Now, then, this very day, give up this lust, this anger and delusion! You! swallowed up in sorrow's mud! if not now given up, they will increase yet more and grow.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1727</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The elephant, hearing Buddha's words, escaped from drunkenness, rejoiced in heart; his mind and body both found rest, as one athirst (finds joy) who drinks of heavenly dew. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1628</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The elephant being thus converted, the people around were filled with joy; they all raised a cry of wonder at the miracle, and brought their offerings of every kind. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1729</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The scarcely-good arrived at middle-virtue, the middling-good passed to a higher grade, the unbelieving now became believers, those who believed were strengthened in their faith. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1730</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Ag&acirc;ta<I>s</I>atru, mighty king, seeing how Buddha conquered the drunken elephant, was moved at heart by thoughts profound; then, filled with joy, he found a twofold growth of piety. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1731</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Tath&acirc;gata, by exercise of virtue, exhibited all kinds of spiritual powers; thus he subdued and harmonised the minds of all, and caused them in due order to attain religious truth; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1732</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And through the kingdom virtuous seeds were sown, as at the first when men began to live (i.e. were first created). But Devadatta, mad with rage, because he was ensnared by his own wickedness, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1733</FONT></span></p>
