<p>The child of the glorious sun of the Ikshv&acirc;ku race, going to that quiet peaceful grove, reverently stood before the Muni, the great <I>Ri</I>shi Ar&acirc;<I>d</I>a R&acirc;ma, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 919</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The dark-clad (?) followers of the Kalam (Sa&#7749;gh&acirc;r&acirc;ma) seeing afar off Bodhisattva approaching, with loud voice raised a joyful chant, and with suppressed breath muttered 'Welcome,' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 920</FONT></span></p>  
<p>As with clasped hands they reverenced him. Approaching one another, they made mutual enquiries; and this being done, with the usual apologies, according to their precedence (in age)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_350"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> they sat down; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 921</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins observing the prince, (beheld) his personal beauty and carefully considered his</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A></p>  
<p>appearance; respectfully&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_351"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they satisfied themselves of his high qualities, like those who, thirsty, drink the 'pure dew.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 922</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(Then) with raised hands they addressed the prince, 'Have you&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (or, may we know whether you have) been long an ascetic, divided from your family and broken from the bonds of love, like the elephant who has cast off restraint? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 923</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Full of wisdom (your appearance), completely enlightened, (you seem) well able to escape the poisonous fruit (of this world)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. In old time the monarch Ming Shing &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> (brightly victorious) gave up his kingly estate to his son, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 924</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'As a man who has carried a flowery wreath, when withered casts it away: but such is not your case, full of youthful vigour, and yet not enamoured with the condition of a holy king; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 925</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'We see that your will is strong and fixed, capable of becoming a vessel of the true law, able to embark in the boat of wisdom, and to cross over the sea of life and death: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 926</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The common class&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, enticed to come to learn, their talents first are tested, then they are taught; but as I understand your case, your mind is already fixed and your will firm: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 927</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'And now you have undertaken the purpose of learning, (I am persuaded) you will not in the end shrink from it.' The prince hearing this exhortation, with gladness made reply: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 928</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'You have with equal intention, illustrious&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>! cautioned me with impartial mind; with humble heart I accept the advice, and pray that it may be so with me, (as you anticipate); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 929</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'That I may in my night journey obtain a torch, to guide me safely thro&#8217; treacherous places; a handy boat to cross over the sea;--may it be so even now with me! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 930</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But as I am somewhat in doubt and anxious to learn, I will venture to make known my doubts, and ask, with respect to old age, disease, and death, how are these things to be escaped?' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 931</FONT></span></p>  
<p>At this time O-lo-lam (Ar&acirc;<I>d</I>a K&acirc;l&acirc;ma) hearing the question asked by the prince, briefly from the various S&ucirc;tras and <I>S</I>&acirc;stras, quoted passages in explanation of a way of deliverance. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 932</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But thou (he said) illustrious youth! so highly gifted, and eminent among the wise! hear what I have to say, as I discourse upon the mode of ending birth and death; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 933</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Nature, and change, birth, old age, and death, these five (attributes) belong to all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; "nature" is (in itself)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> pure and without fault; the involution of this with the five elements&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 934</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Causes an awakening and power of perception, which, according to its exercise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is the cause of "change;" form, sound, order, taste, touch, these are called the five objects of sense (dh&acirc;tu); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 935</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'As the hand and foot are called the "two ways" (methods of moving?) so these are called "the roots" of action (the five skandhas); the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, these are named the "roots" (instruments) of understanding. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 936</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The root of "mind" (manas)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is twofold, being both material, and also intelligent; "nature" by its involutions is "the cause," the knower of the cause is "I" (the soul); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 937</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Kapila the <I>Ri</I>shi and his numerous followers, on this deep principle of "soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>," practising wisdom (Buddhi), found deliverance. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 938</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Kapila and now V&acirc;<I>k</I>aspati&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, by the power of "Buddhi" perceiving the character of birth, old age, and death, declare that on this is founded true philosophy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 939</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Whilst all opposed to this, they say, is false. "Ignorance" and "passion," causing constant "transmigration," <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 940</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Abiding in the midst of these (they say) is the lot of "all that lives." Doubting the truth of "soul" is called "excessive doubt," and without distinguishing aright, there can be no method of escape. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 941</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Deep speculation as to the limits of perception is but to involve the "soul;" thus unbelief leads to confusion, and ends in differences of thought and conduct. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 942</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Again, the various speculations on "soul" (such as) "I say," "I know and perceive," "I come" and "I go" or "I remain fixed," these are called the intricacies (windings) of "soul"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 943</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And then the fancies raised in different natures, some saying "this is so," others denying it, and this condition of uncertainty is called the state of "darkness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>." <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 944</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Then there are those who say that outward things (resembling forms) are one with "soul," who say that the "objective" is the same as "mind," who confuse "intelligence" with "instruments," who say that "number" is the "soul." <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 945</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Thus not distinguishing aright, these are called "excessive quibbles," "marks of folly," "nature changes," and so on. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 946</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'To worship and recite religious books, to slaughter living things in sacrifice, to render pure by fire and water, and thus awake the thought of final rescue, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 947</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All these ways of thinking are called "without right expedient," the result of ignorance and doubt, by means of word or thought or deed; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 948</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Involving outward relationships, this is called "depending on means;" making the material world the ground of "soul," this is called "depending on the senses." <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 949</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'By these eight sorts of speculation are we involved in birth and death. The foolish masters of the world make their classifications in these five ways, (viz.) <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 950</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Darkness, folly, and great folly, angry passion, with timid fear. Indolent coldness is called "darkness;" birth and death are called "folly;" <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 951</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Lustful desire is "great folly;" because of great men subjected to error&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_367"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, cherishing angry feelings, "passion" results; trepidation of the heart is called "fear." <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 952</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Thus these foolish men dilate upon the five desires; but the root of the great sorrow of birth and death, the life destined to be spent in the five ways, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 953</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The cause of the whirl of life, I clearly perceive, is to be placed in the existence of "I;" because of the influence of this cause, result the consequences of repeated birth and death; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 954</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'This cause is without any nature of its own, and its fruits have no nature; rightly considering what has been said, there are four matters which have to do with escape, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 955</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Kindling wisdom--opposed to dark ignorance,--making manifest--opposed to concealment and obscurity,--if these four matters be understood, then we may escape birth, old age, and death. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 956</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Birth, old age, and death being over, then we attain a final place; the Brahmans&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> all depending on this principle, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 957</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Practising themselves in a pure life, have also largely dilated on it, for the good of the world.' The prince hearing these words again enquired of &Acirc;r&acirc;<I>d</I>a: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 958</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Tell me what are the expedients you name, and what is the final place to which they lead, and what is the character of that pure (Brahman) life; and again what are the stated periods <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 959</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'During which such life must be practised, and during which such life is lawful; all these are principles to be enquired into; and on them I pray you discourse for my sake.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 960</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then that &Acirc;r&acirc;<I>d</I>a, according to the S&ucirc;tras and <I>S</I>&acirc;stras, spoke, 'Yourself using wisdom is the expedient; but I will further dilate on this a little; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 961</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'First by removing from the crowd and leading a hermit's life, depending entirely on alms for food, extensively practising rules of decorum, religiously adhering to right rules of conduct, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 962</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Desiring little and knowing when to abstain, receiving whatever is given (in food), whether pleasant or otherwise, delighting to practise a quiet (ascetic) life, diligently studying all the S&ucirc;tras and <I>S</I>&acirc;stras, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 963</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Observing the character of covetous longing and fear, without remnant of desire to live in purity, to govern well the organs of life, the mind quieted and silently at rest, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 964</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Removing desire, and hating vice, all the sorrows</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of life (the world of desire) put away, then there is happiness; and we obtain the enjoyment of the first&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> dhy&acirc;na. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 965</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Having obtained this first dhy&acirc;na, then with the illumination thus obtained, by inward meditation is born reliance on thought alone, and the entanglements of folly are put away; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 966</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The mind depending on this, then after death, born in the Brahma heavens, the enlightened are able to know themselves; by the use of means is produced further inward illumination; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 967</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Diligently persevering, seeking higher advance, accomplishing the second dhy&acirc;na, tasting of that great joy, we are born in the Kwong-yin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> heaven (Abh&acirc;svara); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 968</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Then by the use of means putting away this delight, practising the third dhy&acirc;na, resting in such delight and wishing no further excellence, there is a birth in the <I>S</I>ubhak<I>ri</I>tsna (hin-tsing) heaven; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 969</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Leaving the thought of such delight, straightway we reach the fourth dhy&acirc;na, all joys and sorrows done away, the thought of escape produced, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 970</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'We dwell in this fourth dhy&acirc;na, and are born in the V<I>ri</I>hat-phala heaven; because of its long enduring years, it is thus called V<I>ri</I>hat-phala (extensive-fruit); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 971</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Whilst in that state of abstraction rising (higher), perceiving there is a place beyond any bodily condition, adding still and persevering further in practising wisdom, rejecting this fourth dhy&acirc;na, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 972</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Firmly resolved to persevere in the search, still contriving to put away every desire after form, gradually from every pore of the body there is perceived a feeling of empty release, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 973</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And in the end this extends to every solid part, so that the whole is perfected in an apprehension of emptiness. In brief, perceiving no limits to. this emptiness, there is opened to the view boundless knowledge. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 974</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Endowed with inward rest and peace, the idea of "I" departs, and the object of "I:" clearly discriminating the non-existence of matter (bhava), this is the condition of immaterial life. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 975</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'As the Mu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>a (grass) when freed from its horny case, or as the wild bird which escapes from its prison trap, so, getting away from all material limitations, we thus find perfect release. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 976</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus ascending above the Brahmans (Brahmalokas?), deprived of every vestige of bodily existence, we still endure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Endued with wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>! let it be known this is real and true deliverance. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 977</FONT></span></p>  
<p>You ask what are the expedients for obtaining this escape; even as I have before detailed, those who have deep faith will learn. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 978</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The <I>Ri</I>shis <I>G</I>aig&icirc;shavya, <I>G</I>anaka, V<I>ri</I>ddha Par&acirc;<I>s</I>ara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_373"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and other searchers after truth, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 979</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All by the way I have explained, have reached true deliverance.' The prince hearing these words, deeply pondering on the outline of these principles, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 980</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And reaching back to the influences produced by</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A></p>  
<p>our former lives, again asked with further words: 'I have heard your very excellent system of wisdom, the principles very subtle and deep-reaching, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 981</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'From which I learn that because of not "letting go" (by knowledge as a cause), we do not reach the end of the religious life; but by understanding nature in its involutions, then, you say, we obtain deliverance; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 982</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I perceive this law of birth has also concealed in it another law as a germ; you say that the "I" (i.e. "the soul," of Kapila) being rendered pure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_374"></A><A HREF="#fn_374"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, forthwith there is true deliverance; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 983</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But if we encounter a union of cause and effect, then there is a return to the trammels of birth; just as the germ in the seed, when earth, fire, water, and wind <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 984</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Seem to have destroyed in it the principle of life, meeting with favourable concomitant circumstances will yet revive, without any evident cause, but because of desire; so those who have gained this supposed release, (likewise) <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 985</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Keeping the idea of "I" and "living things," have in fact gained no final deliverance; in every condition, letting go the "three classes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_375"></A><A HREF="#fn_375"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>" and again reaching the three&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> "excellent qualities," <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 986</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Because of the eternal existence of soul, by the subtle influences of that, (influences resulting from the past,) the heart lets go the idea of expedients, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 987</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And obtains an almost endless duration of years. This, you say, is true release; you say "letting go the ground on which the idea of soul rests," that this frees us from "limited&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> existence," <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 988</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'And that the mass of people have not yet removed the idea of soul, (and are therefore still in bondage). But what is this letting go "gu<I>n</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>" (cords fettering the soul); if one is fettered by these "gu<I>n</I>as," how can there be release? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 989</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For gu<I>n</I>&icirc; (the object) and "gu<I>n</I>a" (the quality) in idea are different, but in substance one; if you say that you can remove the properties of a thing (and leave the thing) by arguing it to the end, this is not so. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 990</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If you remove heat from fire, then there is no such thing as fire, or if you remove surface (front) from body, what body can remain? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 991</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Thus "gu<I>n</I>a" is as it were surface, remove this and there can be no "gu<I>n</I>&icirc;." So that this deliverance, spoken of before, must leave a body yet in bonds. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 992</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Again, you say that by "clear knowledge" you get rid of body; there is then such a thing as knowledge or the contrary; if you affirm the existence of clear knowledge, then there should be some one who possesses it (i.e. possesses this knowledge); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 993</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If there be a possessor, how can there be deliverance (from this personal "I")? If you say there is no "knower," then who is it that is spoken of as "knowing?" <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 994</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If there is knowledge and no person, then the subject of knowledge may be a stone or a log; moreover, to have clear knowledge of these minute causes of contamination and reject them thoroughly, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 995</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'These being so rejected, there must be an end, then, of the "doer." What Ar&acirc;<I>d</I>a has declared cannot satisfy my heart. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 996</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'This clear knowledge is not "universal wisdom," I must go on and seek a better explanation.' Going on then to the place of Udra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_379"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <I>Ri</I>shi, he also expatiated on this question of 'I.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 997</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(But) although he refined the matter to the utmost, laying down a term of 'thought' and 'no thought' taking the position of removing 'thought' and 'no thought,' yet even so he came not out of the mire; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 998</FONT></span></p>  
<p>For supposing creatures attained that state, still (he said) there is a possibility of returning to the coil, whilst Bodhisattva sought a method of getting out of it. So once more leaving Udra <I>Ri</I>shi, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 999</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He went on in search of a better system, and came at last to Mount Kia-<I>k</I>e&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_380"></A><A HREF="#fn_380"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> [the forest of mortification], where was a town called Pain-suffering forest (Uravilva?). Here the five Bhikshus had gone before. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1000</FONT></span></p>  
<p>When then he beheld these five, virtuously keeping in check their senses (passion-members), holding to the rules of moral conduct, practising mortification, dwelling in that grove of mortification&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_381"></A><A HREF="#fn_381"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1001</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Occupying a spot beside the Naira<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ana river, perfectly composed and filled with contentment, Bodhisattva forthwith by them (selecting) one spot, quietly gave himself to thought. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1002</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The five Bhikshus knowing him with earnest heart to be seeking escape, offered him their services with devotion, as if reverencing &Icirc;<I>s</I>vara Deva. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1003</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Having finished their attentions and dutiful services, then going on he took his seat not far off, as one about to enter on a course of religious practice, composing all his members as he desired. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1004</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Bodhisattva diligently applied himself to 'means,' as one about to cross over old age, disease, and death. With full purpose of heart (he set himself) to endure mortification, to restrain every bodily passion, and give up thought about sustenance, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1005</FONT></span></p>  
<p>With purity of heart to observe the fast-rules, which no worldly man (active man) can bear; silent and still, lost in thoughtful meditation; and so for six years he continued, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1006</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Each day eating one hemp grain, his bodily form shrunken and attenuated, seeking how to cross (the sea) of birth and death, exercising himself still deeper and advancing further; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1007</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Making his way perfect by the disentanglements of true wisdom, not eating, and yet not (looking to that as) a cause (of emancipation), his four members although exceedingly weak, his heart of wisdom increasing yet more and more in light; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1008</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His spirit free, his body light and refined, his name spreading far and wide, as 'highly gifted,' even as the moon when first produced, or as the Kumuda flower spreading out its sweetness; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1009</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Everywhere thro&#8217; the country his excellent fame extended; the daughters of the lord of the place both coming to see him, his mortified body like a withered branch, just completing the period of six years, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1010</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Fearing the sorrow of birth and death, seeking earnestly the method (cause) of true wisdom, he</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_144"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 144</FONT></A></p>  
<p>came to the conviction that these were not the means to extinguish desire and produce ecstatic contemplation; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1011</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Nor yet (the means by which) in former time, seated underneath the <I>G</I>ambu tree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he arrived at that miraculous condition, that surely was the proper way, (he thought), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1012</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The way opposed to this of 'withered body.' I should therefore rather seek strength of body, by drink and food refresh my members, and with contentment cause my mind to rest. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1013</FONT></span></p>  
<p>My mind at rest, I shall enjoy silent composure; composure is the trap for getting ecstasy (dhy&acirc;na); whilst in ecstasy perceiving the true law (right law, i.e. truth), then the force of truth (the law) obtained, disentanglement will follow. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1014</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And thus composed, enjoying perfect quiet, old age and death are put away; and then defilement is escaped by this first means; thus then by equal steps the excellent law results from life restored by food and drink. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1015</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Having carefully considered this principle, bathing in the Naira<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ana river, he desired afterwards to leave the water (pool), but owing to extreme exhaustion was unable to rise; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1016</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then a heavenly spirit holding out (pressing down) a branch, taking this in his hand he (raised himself and) came forth. At this time on the opposite side of the grove there was a certain chief herdsman, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1017</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Whose eldest daughter was called Nand&acirc;. One of the <I>S</I>uddhav&acirc;sa Devas addressing her said, 'Bodhisattva</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_145"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 145</FONT></A></p>  
<p>dwells in the grove, go you then, and present to him a religious offering.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1018</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Nand&acirc; Balada (or Bala<I>g</I>a or Baladhya) with joy came to the spot, above her hands (i.e. on her wrists) white chalcedony bracelets, her clothing of a grey (bluish) colour (dye); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1019</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The grey and the white together contrasted in the light, as the colours of the rounded river bubble; with simple heart and quicken&#8217;d step she came, and, bowing down at Bodhisattva's feet, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1020</FONT></span></p>  
<p>She reverently offered him perfumed rice milk, begging him of his condescension to accept it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Bodhisattva taking it, partook of it (at once), whilst she received, even then, the fruits of her religious act. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1021</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Having eaten it, all his members refreshed, he became capable of receiving Bodhi; his body and limbs glistening with (renewed strength), and his energies swelling higher still&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_384"></A><A HREF="#fn_384"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1022</FONT></span></p>  
<p>As the hundred streams swell the sea, or the first quarter&#8217;d moon daily increases in brightness. The five Bhikshus having witnessed this, perturbed, were filled with suspicious reflection; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1023</FONT></span></p>  
<p>They supposed (said) that his religious zeal (heart) was flagging, and that he was leaving and looking for a better abode, as though he had obtained deliverance, the five elements entirely removed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_385"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1024</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_146"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 146</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Bodhisattva wandered on alone, directing his course to that 'fortunate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_386"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>' tree, beneath whose shade he might accomplish his search after complete enlightenment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_387"></A><A HREF="#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1025</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(Over) the ground wide and level, producing soft and pliant grass, easily he advanced with lion step, pace by pace, (whilst) the earth shook withal; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1026</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And as it shook, K&acirc;la n&acirc;ga aroused, was filled with joy, as his eyes were opened to the light. Forthwith he exclaimed: 'When formerly I saw the Buddhas of old, there was the sign of an earthquake as now; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1027</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The virtues of a Muni are so great in majesty, that the great earth cannot endure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_388"></A><A HREF="#fn_388"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> them; as step by step his foot treads upon the ground, so is there heard the sound of the rumbling earth-shaking; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1028</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'A brilliant light now illumes the world, as the shining of the rising sun; five hundred bluish tinted birds (I see), wheeling round to the right, flying through space; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1029</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'A gentle, soft, and cooling breeze blows around in an agreeable way; all these auspicious (miraculous) signs are the same as those of former Buddhas; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1030</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Wherefore I know that this Bodhisattva will certainly arrive at perfect wisdom. And now, behold! from yonder man, a grass cutter, he obtains some pure and pliant grass, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1031</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Which spreading out beneath the tree, with upright body, there he takes his seat; his feet placed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_147"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147</FONT></A></p>  
<p>under him, not carelessly arranged (moving to and fro), but like the firmly fixed and compact body of a N&acirc;ga; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1032</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Nor shall he rise again from off his seat till he has completed his undertaking.' And so he (the N&acirc;ga) uttered these words by way of confirmation. The heavenly N&acirc;gas, filled with joy, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1033</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(Caused a) cool refreshing breeze to rise; the trees and grass were yet unmoved by it, and all the beasts, quiet and silent, (looked on in wonderment.) <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1034</FONT></span></p>  
<p>These are the signs that Bodhisattva will certainly attain enlightenment. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1035</FONT></span></p>
