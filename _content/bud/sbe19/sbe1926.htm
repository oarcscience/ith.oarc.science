<p>The venerable &Acirc;nanda, seeing the earth shaking on every side, his heart was fearful and his hair erect; he asked the cause thereof of Buddha. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1847</FONT></span></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Buddha replied: '&Acirc;nanda! I have fixed three months to end my life, the rest of life I utterly give up; this is the reason why the earth is greatly shaken.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1848</FONT></span></p>  
<p>&Acirc;nanda, hearing the instruction of Buddha, was moved with pity and the tears flowed down his face, even as when an elephant of mighty strength shakes (with a blow) the sandal-wood tree. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1849</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus was (&Acirc;nanda) shaken and his mind perturbed, whilst down (his cheeks) the tears, like drops of perfume, flowed; so much he loved the lord his master, so full of kindness (was he), and, as yet, not freed from earthly thoughts (desire)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_726"></A><A HREF="#fn_726"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1850</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thinking then on these four things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_727"></A><A HREF="#fn_727"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> alone, he gave his grief full liberty, nor could he master it, (but said), 'Now I hear the lord declare that he has fixed for good his time to die (Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1851</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'My body fails, my strength is gone, my mind is dazed, my soul is all discordant, and all the words of truth forgotten; a wild deserted waste seems heaven and earth. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1852</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Have pity! save me, master (lord of the world)! perish not so soon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_728"></A><A HREF="#fn_728"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>! Perished with bitter cold&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_729"></A><A HREF="#fn_729"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, I chanced upon a fire--forthwith it disappeared. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1853</FONT></span></p>

<p>'Wandering amid the wilds of grief and pain, deceived, confused, I lost my way--suddenly a wise and prudent guide encountered me, but hardly saved from my bewilderment, he once more vanished. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1854</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Like some poor man treading through endless mud, weary and parched with thirst, longs for the water, suddenly he lights upon a cool refreshing lake, he hastens to it--lo! it dries before him. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1855</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The deep blue, bright, refulgent eye&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_730"></A><A HREF="#fn_730"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, piercing through all the worlds, with wisdom brightens the dark gloom, the darkness (but) for a moment is dispelled&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_731"></A><A HREF="#fn_731"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1856</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'As when the blade shoots through the yielding earth, the clouds collect and we await the welcome shower, then a fierce wind drives the big clouds away, and so with disappointed hope we watch the dried-up field! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1857</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Deep darkness reigned for want of wisdom, the world of sentient creatures groped for light, Tath&acirc;gata lit up the lamp of wisdom, then suddenly extinguished it--ere he had brought it out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_732"></A><A HREF="#fn_732"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1858</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Buddha, hearing &Acirc;nanda speaking thus, grieved at his words, and pitying his distress, with soothing accents and with gentle presence spake with purpose to declare the one true&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_733"></A><A HREF="#fn_733"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> law: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1859</FONT></span></p>

<p>'If men but knew their own&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_734"></A><A HREF="#fn_734"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> nature, they would not dwell (indulge) in sorrow; everything that lives, whate&#8217;er it be&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_735"></A><A HREF="#fn_735"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, all this is subject to destruction's law; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1860</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I have already told you plainly, the law (nature) of things "joined&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_736"></A><A HREF="#fn_736"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>" is to "separate;" the principle of kindness and of love&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_737"></A><A HREF="#fn_737"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is not abiding, &#8217;tis better then to reject this pitiful and doting heart. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1861</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All things around us bear the stamp of instant change; born, they perish; no self-sufficiency&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_738"></A><A HREF="#fn_738"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; those who would wish to keep them long, find in the end no room for doing so. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1862</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If things around us could be kept for aye, and were not liable to change or separation, then this would be salvation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_739"></A><A HREF="#fn_739"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>! where then can this be sought? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1863</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'You, and all that lives, can seek in me this great deliverance! That which you may all attain</p>

<p><A NAME="page_272"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 272</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> I have already told you, (and tell you) to the end. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1864</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Why then should I preserve this body? The body of the excellent law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_740"></A><A HREF="#fn_740"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> shall long endure! I am resolved; I look for rest! This is the one thing needful&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_741"></A><A HREF="#fn_741"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1865</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'So do I now instruct all creatures, and as a guide, not seen before, I lead them; prepare yourselves to cast off consciousness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_742"></A><A HREF="#fn_742"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, fix yourselves well in your own island&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_743"></A><A HREF="#fn_743"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1866</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Those who are thus fixed (mid-stream), with single aim and earnestness striving in the use of means, preparing quietly a quiet place, not moved by others' way of thinking, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1867</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Know well, such men are safe on the law's island. Fixed in contemplation, lighted by the lamp of wisdom, they have thus finally destroyed ignorance and gloom. Consider well the world's four bounds, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1868</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And dare to seek for true religion only; forget "yourself," and every "ground of self," the bones, the nerves, the skin, the flesh, the mucus, the blood that flows through every little vein; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1869</FONT></span></p>

<p><A NAME="page_273"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 273</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Behold these things as constantly impure, what joy then can there be in such a body? every sensation born from cause, like the bubble floating on the water. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1870</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The sorrow coming from (the consciousness of) birth and death and inconstancy, removes all thought of joy--the mind acquainted with the law of production&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_744"></A><A HREF="#fn_744"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, stability, and destruction, (recognises) how again and once again things follow or (succeed one another) with no endurance. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1871</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But thinking well about Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_745"></A><A HREF="#fn_745"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the thought of endurance is for ever dismissed, (we see how) the sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_746"></A><A HREF="#fn_746"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> from causes have arisen, and how these aggregates will again dissolve, all of them impermanent. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1872</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The foolish man conceives the idea of "self," the wise man sees there is no ground on which to build the idea of "self," thus through the world he rightly looks and well concludes, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1873</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All, therefore, is but evil (one perverse way)--the aggregate amassed by sorrow must perish (in the end)! if once confirmed in this conviction, that man perceives the truth. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1874</FONT></span></p>

<p>'This body, too, of Buddha now existing (soon will) perish, the law is one and constant, and without exception.' Buddha having delivered this excellent sermon, appeased the heart of &Acirc;nanda, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1875</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then all the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avis, hearing the report&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_747"></A><A HREF="#fn_747"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with fear and apprehension assembled in a body; devoid of their usual ornaments, they hastened to the place where Buddha was. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1876</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Having saluted him according to custom, they stood on one side, wishing to ask him a question, but not being able to find words. Buddha, knowing well their heart, by way of remedy, in the right use of means&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_748"></A><A HREF="#fn_748"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, spake thus: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1877</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Now I perfectly understand that you have in your minds unusual thoughts, not referring to worldly matters, but wholly connected with subjects of religion; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1878</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And now you wish to hear from me, what may be known respecting the report about my resolve to terminate my life, and my purpose to put an end to the repetition of birth. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1879</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Impermanence is the nature of all that exists&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_749"></A><A HREF="#fn_749"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, constant change and restlessness its conditions; unfixed, unprofitable, without the marks of long endurance. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1880</FONT></span></p>

<p>'The former conquerors (<I>G</I>inas), who lived with strength like &Icirc;<I>s</I>vara, these all have long ago perished, not one remains till now; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1882</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The sun and moon, <I>S</I>akra himself, and the great multitude of his attendants, will all, without exception, perish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_750"></A><A HREF="#fn_750"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; there is not one that can for long endure; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1883</FONT></span></p>  
<p>All the Buddhas of the past ages, numerous as the sands of the Ganges, by their wisdom enlightening the world, have all gone out as a lamp&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_751"></A><A HREF="#fn_751"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1884</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All the Buddhas yet to come will also perish in the same way; why then should I alone be different? I too will pass into Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1885</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But as they prepared others for salvation, so now should you press forward in the path; Vai<I>s</I>&acirc;l&icirc; may be glad indeed, if you should find the way of rest! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1886</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The world, in truth, is void of help, the "three worlds" not enough for joy--stay then the course of sorrow, by engendering a heart without desire. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1887</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Give up for good the long and straggling (way of life), press onward on the northern track&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_752"></A><A HREF="#fn_752"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, step by</p>

<p>At this time the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avis, with saddened hearts, went back along the way; lifting their hands to heaven and sighing bitterly: 'Alas! what sorrow this! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1889</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'His body like the pure gold mountain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_754"></A><A HREF="#fn_754"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the marks upon his person so majestic, ere long and like a towering crag he falls; not to live, then why not, "not to love&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_755"></A><A HREF="#fn_755"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>?" <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1890</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The powers of birth and death, weakened awhile; the lord Tath&acirc;gata, himself the fount (mother) of wisdom (appeared), and now to give it up and disappear! without a saviour now, what check to sorrow. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1891</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The world long time endured in darkness, and men were led by a false light along the way--when lo! the sun of wisdom rose; and now, again, it fades and dies--no warning given. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1892</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Behold the whirling waves of ignorance engulfing all the world! (Why is) the bridge or raft of wisdom in a moment cut away? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1893</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The loving and the great physician king (came) with remedies of wisdom, beyond all price, to heal the hurts and pains of men--why suddenly goes he away? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1894</FONT></span></p>

<p>'The glorious flag of heavenly worship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_756"></A><A HREF="#fn_756"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>! Why in a moment is it snapped? Why such misfortune for the world, when from the tide of constant revolutions <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1896</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'A way of escape was opened-but now shut again! and there is no escape from weary sorrow!' Tath&acirc;gata, possessed of fond and loving heart, now steels himself and goes away; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1897</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He holds his heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_757"></A><A HREF="#fn_757"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> so patient and so loving, and, like the Wai-ka-ni (Vakkani?) flower, with thoughts cast down (irresolute) and tardy, he goes depressed along the road; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1898</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Or like a man fresh from a loved one's grave, the funeral past and the last farewell taken, comes back (with anxious look). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1899</FONT></span></p>

It would be well to compare the, spirit of this sermon with the old belief of the Veda, respecting the birth of the 'one nature' from which the visible world took shape (History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature by Max M&uuml;ller, p. 561). It seems that the effort of Buddha was to transcend the time of the birth of this nature, and thus arrive at the condition of the original first cause, which 'breathed breathless;' in other words, this is the condition of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a.</P>

It is the receptive (subjective) power, in distinction to the perceptive power (vedan&acirc;).

<P><A NAME="fn_746"></A><A HREF="sbe1926.htm#fr_746">273:3</A> The sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ras, the elements of being, i.e. individual being (for a full account of this term, see Childers' P&acirc;li Dict. sub voce). With regard to the use of the Chinese 'hing' for sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ra, see Eitel, Handbook, sub sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ra; also consult Colebrooke, Hindu Philosophy, p. 254, and Burnouf (Introduction, pp. 504, 505, note 2).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_747"></A><A HREF="sbe1926.htm#fr_747">274:1</A> 'Hearing it,' in the original, i.e. hearing the report of Buddha's approaching death.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_748"></A><A HREF="sbe1926.htm#fr_748">274:2</A> 'The right use of means' is the rendering of the Chinese 'fang pien,' the Sanskrit up&acirc;ya; this term may mean 'by artifice,' or, 'by way of expedient;' but generally it refers to the use of means to an end, where the 'means' are evanescent and illusory; the end attained, lasting and real.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_750"></A><A HREF="sbe1926.htm#fr_750">275:1</A> That the gods were considered to be mortal appears, as Wilson says (Rig-veda, vol. i, p. 7 n), from the title (nara) given to them. Compare also Coxe, Mythol. II, p. 13, and Muir, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1864, p. 62.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_751"></A><A HREF="sbe1926.htm#fr_751">275:2</A> This idea of a lamp going out is a fundamental one as a definition of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a (pa<I>g</I><I>g</I>otassa nibb&acirc;nam). Its meaning has been discussed by Professor Max M&uuml;ller in his Introduction to Buddhaghosha's Parables (by Captain Rogers).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_753"></A><A HREF="sbe1926.htm#fr_753">276:1</A> The idea appears to be, that as the sun advances in his course, he approaches the western mountains as his true setting place, i.e. he approaches the equinoctial point.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_754"></A><A HREF="sbe1926.htm#fr_754">276:2</A> This comparison of Buddha's body to the golden mountain (sumeru) is a very frequent one, and is probably allied in its origin with the idea of Bel, 'the great mountain' (sadu rabu).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_755"></A><A HREF="sbe1926.htm#fr_755">276:3</A> The sense is, 'if he dies, where is the proof of his love?'</P>
