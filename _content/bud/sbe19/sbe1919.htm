<p>At this time Bimbis&acirc;ra R&acirc;<I>g</I>a, bowing his head, requested the honoured of the world to change his</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_193"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 193</FONT></A></p>  
<p>place of abode for the bamboo grove&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; graciously accepting it, Buddha remained silent. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1380</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then the king, having perceived the truth, offered his adoration and returned to his palace. The world-honoured, with the great congregation, proceeded on foot, to rest for awhile in the bamboo garden&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1381</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(There he dwelt) to convert all that breathed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, to kindle once for all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the lamp of wisdom, to establish Brahma and the Devas, and to confirm the lives&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of saints and sages. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1382</FONT></span></p>  
<p>At this time A<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it and V&acirc;shpa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_494"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, with heart composed and every member (sense) subdued, the time having come for begging food, entered into the town of R&acirc;<I>g</I>ag<I>ri</I>ha: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1383</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Unrivalled in the world were they for grace of person, and in dignity of carriage excelling all. The lords and ladies of the city seeing them, were filled with joy; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1384</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Those who were walking stood still, those before waited, those behind hastened on. Now the <I>Ri</I>shi: Kapila amongst all his numerous disciples <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1385</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_194"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 194</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Had one of wide-spread fame, whose name was <I>S</I>&acirc;riputra; he, beholding the wonderful grace of the Bhikshus, their composed mien and subdued senses, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1386</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Their dignified walk and carriage, raising his hands, enquiring, said: 'Young in years, but pure and graceful in appearance, such as I before have never seen, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1387</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'What law most excellent (have you obeyed)? and who your master that has taught you? and what the doctrine you have learned? Tell me, I pray you, and relieve my doubts.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1388</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then of the Bhikshus, one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, rejoicing at his question, with pleasing air and gracious words, replied: 'The omniscient, born of the Ikshv&acirc;ku family, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1389</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The very first &#8217;midst gods and men, this one is my great master. I am indeed but young, the sun of. wisdom has but just arisen, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1390</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'How can I then explain the master's doctrine? Its meaning is deep and very hard to understand, but now, according to my poor capability (wisdom), I will recount in brief the master's doctrine: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1391</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'"Whatever things exist all spring from cause, the principles (cause) of birth and death (may be) destroyed, the way is by the means he has declared&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>."' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1392</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_195"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 195</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Then the twice-born Upata (Upatishya), embracing heartily what he had heard, put from him all sense-pollution, and obtained the pure eyes of the law. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1393</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The former explanations he had trusted, respecting cause and what was not the cause, that there was nothing that was made, but was made by &Icirc;<I>s</I>vara, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1394</FONT></span></p>  
<p>All this, now that he had heard the rule of true causation, understanding (penetrating) the wisdom of the no-self, adding thereto the knowledge of the minute (dust) troubles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which can never be overcome in their completeness (completely destroyed), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1395</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But by the teaching of Tath&acirc;gata, all this he now for ever put away; leaving no room for thought of self, the thought of self will disappear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1396</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Who, when the brightness of the sun gives light, would call for the dimness of the lamp? for, like the severing of the lotus, the stem once cut, the pods (?) will also die; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1397</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'So Buddha's teaching cutting off the stem of sorrow, no seeds are left to grow or lead to further increase.' Then bowing at the Bhikshu's feet, with grateful mien, he wended homewards. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1398</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The Bhikshus after having begged their food, likewise went back to the bamboo grove. S&acirc;riputra</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_196"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 196</FONT></A></p>  
<p>on his arrival home, (rested) with joyful face and full of peace. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1399</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His friend the honoured Mugalin (Maudgaly&acirc;yana), equally renowned for learning, seeing <I>S</I>&acirc;riputra in the distance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, his pleasing air and lightsome step, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1400</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Spoke thus: 'As I now see thee, there is an unusual look I notice, your former nature seems quite changed, the signs of happiness I now observe, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1401</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All indicate the possession of eternal truth, these marks are not uncaused.' Answering he said: The words of the Tath&acirc;gata are such as never yet were spoken;' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1402</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And then, requested, he declared (what he had heard). Hearing the words and understanding them, he too put off the world's defilement, and gained the eyes of true religion, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1403</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The reward of a long-planted virtuous cause; and, as one sees by a lamp that comes to hand, so he obtained an unmoved faith in Buddha; and now they both set out for Buddha's presence, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1404</FONT></span></p>  
<p>With a large crowd of followers, two hundred men and fifty. Buddha seeing the two worthies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> coming, spoke thus to his disciples: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1405</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'These two men who come shall be my two most eminent followers, one unsurpassed for wisdom, the other for powers miraculous;' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1406</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And then with Brahma's voice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, profound and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_197"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 197</FONT></A></p>  
<p>sweet, he forthwith bade them 'Welcome!' Here is the pure and peaceful law (he said); here the end of all discipleship! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1407</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Their hands grasping the triple-staff&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, their twisted hair holding the water-vessel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, hearing the words of Buddha's welcome, they forthwith changed into complete <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1408</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The leaders two and all their followers, assuming the complete appearance of Bhikshus, with prostrate forms fell down at Buddha's feet, then rising, sat beside him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1409</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And with obedient heart listening to the word, they all became Rahats. At this time there was a twice-(born) sage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa Shi-ming-teng (Eggidatta) (Agnidatta), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1410</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Celebrated and perfect in person, rich in possessions, and his wife most virtuous. But all this he</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_198"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 198</FONT></A></p>  
<p>had left and become a hermit, seeking the way of salvation. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1411</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And now in the way by the To-tseu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> tower he suddenly encountered <I>S</I>&acirc;kya Muni, remarkable for his dignified and illustrious appearance, as the embroidered flag of a Deva (temple); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1412</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Respectfully and reverently approaching, with head bowed down, he worshipped his feet, whilst he said: 'Truly, honoured one, you are my teacher, and I am your follower, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1413</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Much and long time have I been harassed with doubts, oh! would that you would light the lamp&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (of knowledge).' Buddha knowing that this twice-(born) sage was heartily desirous of finding the best mode of escape&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1414</FONT></span></p>  
<p>With soft and pliant voice, he bade him come and welcome. Hearing his bidding and his heart complying, losing all listlessness of body or spirit, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1415</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His soul embraced the terms of this most excellent salvation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Quiet and calm, putting away defilement, the great merciful, as he alone knew how, briefly explained the mode of this deliverance, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1416</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Exhibiting the secrets of his law, ending with}</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_199"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 199</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the four indestructible acquirements&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The great sage, everywhere celebrated, was called Mah&acirc; K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1417</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His original faith was that 'body and soul are different,' but he had also held that they are the same, that there was both 'I' and a place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> for I; but now he for ever cast away his former faith, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1418</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And considered only (the truth) that 'sorrow' is ever accumulating; so (he argued) by removing sorrow there will be 'no remains' (i.e. no subject for suffering); obedience to the precepts and the practice of discipline, though not themselves the cause, yet he considered these the necessary mode by which to find deliverance. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1419</FONT></span></p>  
<p>With equal and impartial mind, he considered the nature of sorrow, for evermore freed from a cleaving heart. Whether we think 'this is,' or 'this is not' (he thought), both tend to produce a listless (idle) mode of life; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1420</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But when with equal mind we see the truth, then certainty is produced and no more doubt. If we rely for support on wealth or form, then wild confusion and concupiscence result, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1421</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Inconstant and impure. But lust and covetous desire removed, the heart of love and equal thoughts produced, there can be then no enemies or friends (variance), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1422</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But the heart is pitiful and kindly disposed to all, and thus is destroyed the power of anger and of hate. Trusting to outward things and their relationships, then crowding thoughts of every kind are gendered; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1423</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_200"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 200</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Reflecting well, and crushing out confusing thought, then lust for pleasure is destroyed. Though born in the Ar&ucirc;pa world (he saw) that there would be a remnant of life still left; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1424</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Unacquainted with the four right truths, he had felt an eager longing for this deliverance, for the quiet resulting from the absence of all thought. And now putting away for ever covetous desire for such a formless state of being, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1425</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His restless heart was agitated still, as the stream is excited by the rude wind. Then entering on deep reflection in quiet he subdued his troubled mind, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1426</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And realised the truth of there being no 'self,' and that therefore birth and death are no realities; but beyond this point he rose not, his thought of 'self' destroyed, all else was lost. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1427</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But now the lamp of wisdom lit, the gloom of every doubt dispersed, he saw an end to that which seemed without an end; ignorance finally dispelled, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1428</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He considered the ten points of excellence; the ten seeds of sorrow destroyed, he came once more to life, and what he ought to do, he did. And now regarding with reverence the face of his lord, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1429</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He put away the three&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and gained the three&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_514"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; so were there three disciples&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in addition to the</p>

<p>Waiting upon the three and five&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, so the three wait on Buddha. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1431</FONT></span></p>
