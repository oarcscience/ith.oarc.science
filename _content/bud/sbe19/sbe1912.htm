<p>Hidden among the five mountains&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, standing alone a lovely peak as a roof amid (the others). The trees and shrubs and flowers in bloom, the flowing fountains, and the cooling rills, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 778</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(All these he gazed upon)--then passing on, he entered the city of the five peaks, calm and peaceful, as one come down from heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_303"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

<p>Though young in years, yet glorious in his person, incomparable as the appearance of a great master, seeing him thus, strange thoughts affected them, as if they gazed upon the banner (curtain) of I<I>s</I>vara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 780</FONT></span></p>  
<p>They stayed the foot, who passed athwart the path; those hastened on, who were behind.; those going before, turned back their heads and gazed with earnest, wistful&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> look. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 781</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The marks and distinguishing points of his person&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, on these they fixed their eyes without fatigue, and then approached with reverent homage, joining both their hands in salutation: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 782</FONT></span></p>

<p>With all there was a sense of wondrous joy, as in their several ways they offered what they had, looking at his noble and illustrious features; bending down their bodies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> modestly, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 783</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Correcting every careless or unseemly gesture, thus they showed their reverence to him silently&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; those who with anxious heart, seeking release, were moved by love, with feelings composed bowed down the more&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_309"></A><A HREF="#fn_309"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 784</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Great men and women, in their several engagements&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_310"></A><A HREF="#fn_310"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, at the same time arrested on their way, paid to his person and his presence homage: and following him as they gazed, they went not back. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 785</FONT></span></p>  
<p>For the white circle between his eyebrows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_311"></A><A HREF="#fn_311"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> adorning his wide and violet colour&#8217;d&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_312"></A><A HREF="#fn_312"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> eyes, his noble body bright as gold, his pure and web-joined fingers, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 786</FONT></span></p>  
<p>All these, though he were but a hermit, were marks of one who was a holy king; and now the men and women of R&acirc;<I>g</I>ag<I>ri</I>ha, the old and young alike, were moved, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 787</FONT></span></p>

<p>exhibiting one mark of surprise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, calling before him some man outside, enquired at once the cause of it; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 789</FONT></span></p>  
<p>This one bending his knee below the tower, told fully what he had seen and heard, 'That one of the <I>S</I>&acirc;kya race, renowned of old, a prince most excellent and wonderful, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 790</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Divinely wise, beyond the way of this world, a fitting king to rule the eight regions, now without home, is here, and all men are paying homage to him.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 791</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The king on hearing this was deeply moved at heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_315"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and though his body was restrained, his soul had gone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_316"></A><A HREF="#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Calling his ministers speedily before him, and all his nobles and attendants, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 792</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He bade them follow secretly the (prince's) steps, to observe what charity was given&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. (So in obedience to the command) they followed and watched him steadfastly, as with even gait and unmoved presence <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 793</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He entered on the town and begged his food, according to the rule of all great hermits, with joyful mien and undisturbed mind, not anxious whether much or little alms were given; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 794</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Whatever he received, costly or poor, he placed within his bowl, then turned back to the wood, and having eaten it and drank of the flowing stream, he joyous sat upon the immaculate mountain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_318"></A><A HREF="#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 795</FONT></span></p>

<p>(There he beheld) the green trees fringing with their shade the crags, the scented flowers growing between the intervals, whilst the peacocks and the other birds, joyously flying, mingled their notes; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 796</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His sacred garments bright and lustrous, (shone) as the sun-lit mulberry leaves; the messengers beholding his fixed composure, one by one (returning), reported what they had seen; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 797</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The king hearing it, was moved at heart, and forthwith ordered his royal equipment to be brought, his god-like crown and his flower-bespangled robes; then, as the lion-king, he strided forth, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 798</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And choosing certain aged persons of consideration, learned men, able calmly and wisely to discriminate, he (with them) led the way followed by a hundred thousand people, who like a cloud ascended with the king the royal mountain. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 799</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And now beholding the dignity of Bodhisattva, every outward gesture (spring of action) under government, sitting with ease upon the mountain crag&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_319"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, as the moon shining limpid in the pure heavens, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 800</FONT></span></p>  
<p>So (was) his matchless beauty and purity of grace; then as the converting presence of religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_320"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> dwelling within the heart makes it reverential&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_321"></A><A HREF="#fn_321"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, so (beholding him) he reverently approached, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 801</FONT></span></p>

<p>Bodhisattva, answering as he was moved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, in his turn made similar enquiries. Then the king, the questioning over, sat down with dignity upon a clean-faced rock. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 803</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And so he steadfastly beheld the divine appearance (of the prince), the sweetness and complacency of his features&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> revealing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> what his station was and high estate, his family renown, received by inheritance, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 804</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The king who for a time restrained his feelings, now wishful to get rid of doubts, (enquired) (why one) descended from the royal family of the sun-brightness having attended to religious sacrifices thro&#8217; ten thousand generations, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 805</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Whereof the virtue had descended as his full inheritance, increasing and accumulating until now&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, (why he) so excellent in wisdom, so young in years, had now become a recluse, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 806</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Rejecting the position of a <I>K</I>akravartin's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_328"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> son, begging his food, despising family fame, his beauteous</p>

<p>form, fit for perfumes and anointings, why clothed with coarse Kas&acirc;ya garments; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 807</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The hand which ought to grasp the reins of empire, instead thereof, taking its little stint of food; if indeed (the king continued) you were not of royal descent, and would receive as an offering the transfer of this land, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 808</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then would I divide with you my empire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; saying this, he scarcely hoped to excite his feelings, who had left his home and family, to be a hermit. Then forthwith the king proceeded thus: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 809</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Give just weight I pray you to my truthful words, desire for power is kin to nobleness, and so is just pride of fame or family or wealth or personal appearance; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 810</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'No longer having any wish to subdue the proud, or to bend (others) down and so get thanks from men, it were better, then, to give to the strong and warlike martial arms to wear, for them to follow war and by their power to get supremacy; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 811</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But when by one's own power a kingdom falls to hand, who would not then accept the reins of empire? The wise man knows the time to take religion, wealth, and worldly pleasure. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 812</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But if he obtains not&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the three (or, threefold profit), then in the end he abates his earnest efforts, and reverencing religion, he lets go material wealth. Wealth is the one desire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of worldly men; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 813</FONT></span></p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'To be rich and lose all desire for religion, this is to gain but outside wealth. But to be poor and even thus despise religion, what pleasure can indulgence give in such a case! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 814</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But when possessed of all the three, and when enjoyed with reason and propriety, then religion, wealth, and pleasure make what is rightly called a great master; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 815</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Permit not, then, your perfectly-endowed body to lay aside (sacrifice) its glory, without reward (merit); Mandha(ri) the <I>K</I>akravartin, as a monarch, ruled the four empires of the world, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 816</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And shared with <I>S</I>akra his royal throne, but was unequal to the task of ruling heaven. But you, with your redoubtable strength, may well grasp both heavenly and human power; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 817</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I do not rely upon my kingly power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, in my desire to keep you here by force, but seeing you change your comeliness of person, and wearing the hermit's garb, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 818</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Whilst it makes me reverence you for your virtue, moves me with pity and regret for you as a man; you now go begging your food, and I offer you (desire to offer) the whole land as yours; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 819</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Whilst you are young and lusty enjoy yourself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. During middle life acquire wealth, and when old and all your abilities ripened, then is the time for following the rules of religion; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 820</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'When young to encourage religious fervour, is to destroy the sources of desire; but when old and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the breath (of desire) is less eager, then is the time to seek religious solitude; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 821</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'When old we should avoid, as a shame, desire of wealth, but get honour in the world by a religious life; but when young, and the heart light and elastic, then is the time to partake of pleasure, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 822</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'In boon companionship to indulge in gaiety, and partake to the full of mutual intercourse; but as-years creep on, giving up indulgence, to observe the ordinances of religion, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 823</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'To mortify the five desires, and go on increasing a joyful and religious heart, is not this the law of the eminent kings of old, who as a great company paid worship to heaven, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 824</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And borne on the dragon's back, received the joys of celestial abodes? All these divine and victorious monarchs, glorious in person, richly adorned, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 825</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Thus having as a company performed their religious offering, in the end received the reward of their conduct in heaven.' Thus Bimbas&acirc;ra R&acirc;<I>g</I>a (used) every kind of winning expedient in argument; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 826</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The royal prince unmoved and fixed remained firm as Mount Sumeru.</p>

In the Southern books (Nid&acirc;na-kath&acirc;; Buddhist Birth Stories, by Mr. Rhys Davids, pp. 85 and 87 n.) it is said that from Kapilavastu to the River Anom&acirc;, near which the interview took place, is thirty yo<I>g</I>anas; this is greatly in excess of the real distance, which is about thirty-three miles, or five yo<I>g</I>anas. Then again from the Anom&acirc; River, or the village of Maneya (Mhaniya), where the Bodhisattva halted (see Romantic Legend of Buddha, p. 140, and compare vol. xii, plate viii, Arch&aelig;ological Survey of India), to R&acirc;<I>g</I>ag<I>ri</I>ha by way of Vai<I>s</I>&acirc;l&icirc; would not be more than 180 miles, so that the whole distance from Kapilavastu (assuming Bhuila to represent this old town) would be about 215 miles, or about thirty yo<I>g</I>anas. Hence we assume that the thirty yo<I>g</I>anas of the Southern account is intended to represent the entire distance from Kapilavastu, and not from the River Anom&acirc;. Mr. Rhys Davids supposes the distance from Kapilavastu to R&acirc;<I>g</I>ag<I>ri</I>ha (vi&acirc; Vai<I>s</I>al&icirc;) to be sixty yo<I>g</I>anas (loc. cit. Birth Stories).
