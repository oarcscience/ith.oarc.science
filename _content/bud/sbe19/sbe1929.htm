<p>At this time there was a Devaputra, riding on (or in) his thousand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_829"></A><A HREF="#fn_829"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> white-swan palace&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_830"></A><A HREF="#fn_830"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in the midst of space, who beheld the Parinirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a of Buddha. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2115</FONT></span></p>  
<p>This one, for the universal benefit of the Deva assembly, sounded forth at large these verses (g&acirc;thas) on impermanence: 'Impermanency is the nature of all (things), quickly born, they quickly die. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2116</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'With birth there comes the rush&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_831"></A><A HREF="#fn_831"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of sorrows, only in Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_832"></A><A HREF="#fn_832"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is there joy. The accumulated fuel heaped up by the power of karman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_833"></A><A HREF="#fn_833"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> (deeds), this the fire of wisdom alone can consume. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2117</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Though the fame (of our deeds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_834"></A><A HREF="#fn_834"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>) reach up to heaven as smoke, yet in time the rains which descend will extinguish all, as the fire that rages at the kalpa's end is put out by the judgment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_835"></A><A HREF="#fn_835"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> (calamity) of water.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2118</FONT></span></p>

<p>Again there was a Brahma-<I>Ri</I>shi-deva, like a most exalted <I>Ri</I>shi (a highest-principle <I>Ri</I>shi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_836"></A><A HREF="#fn_836"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), dwelling in heaven, possessed of superior happiness, with no taint in his bliss (heavenly inheritance), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2119</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Who thus sighed forth his praises of Tath&acirc;gata's Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, with his mind fixed in abstraction as he spoke: 'Looking through all the conditions of life (of the three worlds), from first to last nought is free from destruction. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2120</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But the incomparable seer dwelling in the world, thoroughly acquainted with the highest truth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_837"></A><A HREF="#fn_837"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, whose wisdom grasps that which is beyond the (world's) ken&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_838"></A><A HREF="#fn_838"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, he it is who can save the worldly-dwellers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_839"></A><A HREF="#fn_839"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2121</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'He it is who can provide lasting escape (preservation) from the destructive power of impermanence. But, alas! through the wide world, all that lives is sunk in unbelief (heretical teaching).' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2122</FONT></span></p>  
<p>At this time Anuruddha, 'not stopped' (ruddha)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_840"></A><A HREF="#fn_840"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> by the world, 'not stopped' from being delivered</p>

<p>Sighed forth the praises of Tath&acirc;gata's Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a: 'All living things completely blind and dark&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_842"></A><A HREF="#fn_842"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>! the mass of deeds (sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ra) all perishing (inconstant), even as the fleeting cloud-pile&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_843"></A><A HREF="#fn_843"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2124</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Quickly arising and as quickly perishing! the wise man holds not to such a refuge, for the diamond mace of inconstancy. can (even) overturn the mountain of the <I>Ri</I>shi hermit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_844"></A><A HREF="#fn_844"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> (muni). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2125</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'How despicable and how weak the world! doomed to destruction, without strength! Impermanence, like the fierce lion, can even spoil the N&acirc;ga-elephant-great-<I>Ri</I>shi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_845"></A><A HREF="#fn_845"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2126</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Only the diamond curtain of Tath&acirc;gata can overwhelm&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_846"></A><A HREF="#fn_846"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> inconstancy! How much more should those not yet delivered from desire (passion), fear and dread its power. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2127</FONT></span></p>

<p>'The three periods (past, present, future) are but one in substance; the Muni-great-elephant plucks up the great tree of sorrow, and yet he (even he) cannot avoid the power of impermanence. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2129</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For like the crested&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_850"></A><A HREF="#fn_850"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (<I>s</I>ikhin) bird delights (within) the pool (water) to seize the poisonous snake, but when from sudden drought he is left in the dry pool, he dies; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2130</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Or as the prancing steed advances fearlessly to battle, but when the fight has passed goes back subdued and quiet; or as the raging fire burns with the fuel, but when the fuel is done, expires; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2131</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'So is it with Tath&acirc;gata, his task accomplished he returns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_851"></A><A HREF="#fn_851"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to (find his refuge in) Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a: just as the shining of the radiant moon sheds everywhere its light and drives away the gloom, 2132.</p>  
<p>'All creatures grateful for its light, (then suddenly) it disappears concealed by Sumeru; such is the case with Tath&acirc;gata, the brightness of his wisdom lit up the gloomy darkness, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2133</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And for the good of all that lives drove it away, when suddenly it disappears behind the mountain of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a. The splendour of his fame throughout the world diffused, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2134</FONT></span></p>

<p>'Present their offerings to heaven; but from their sacrifice nought but the blacken&#8217;d smoke ascends&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_855"></A><A HREF="#fn_855"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; thus is it with Tath&acirc;gata, his glory hidden, the world has lost its light. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2137</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Rare was the expectancy of grateful love&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_856"></A><A HREF="#fn_856"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> that filled the heart of all that lives; that love, reached its full limit, then was left to perish! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2138</FONT></span></p>

<p>Yet even those who had put away all faults, sighed as they thought of the pain of birth and death. And now the Malla host&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_875"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> hearing that Buddha had attained Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2186</FONT></span></p>  
<p>With cries confused, wept piteously, greatly moved, as when a flight of herons meet a hawk (kite).

<p>Those features never again to awake to consciousness, they smote their breasts and sighed to heaven; as when a lion seizing, on a calf, the whole herd rushes on with mingled sounds. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2188</FONT></span></p>  
<p>In the midst there was one Malla, his mind enamoured of the righteous law, who gazed with steadfastness upon the holy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_877"></A><A HREF="#fn_876"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> law-king, now entered on the mighty calm, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2189</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And said: 'The world was everywhere asleep, when Buddha setting forth his law caused it to awake; but now he has entered on the mighty calm, and all is finished in an unending sleep. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2190</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For man's sake he had raised the standard of his law, and now, in a moment, it has fallen; the sun of Tath&acirc;gata's wisdom spreading abroad the lustre of its "great awakening&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_878"></A><A HREF="#fn_877"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>," <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2191</FONT></span></p>

<p>Thus all that Malla host wept piteously and lamented; whilst some concealed their grief nor spoke a word; others sank prostrate on the earth; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2195</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Others stood silent, lost in meditation; others, with sorrowful heart, groaned deeply.

<p>Thus men and Devas shared one common sorrow, their cries united as they grieved together. Entering the city, there the men and women, old and young, completed their religious offerings. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2199</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Leaving the city, then, and passing through the Lung-tsiang gate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_880"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and crossing over the Hira<I>n</I>yavat&icirc; river, they repaired to where the former Buddhas having died, had <I>K</I>aityas raised to them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_881"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2200</FONT></span></p>  
<p>There collecting ox-head sandal wood and every famous scented wood, they placed the whole above the Buddha's body, pouring various scented oils upon the pyre; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2201</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then placing fire beneath to kindle it, three times they walked around; but yet it burned not.

<p>And knowing Buddha was about to die was coming thence with all his followers; his pure mind, deeply moved, desired to see the body of the lord; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2203</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And so, because of that his sincere wish, the fire went out and would not kindle. Then K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa and his followers coming, with piteous sighs looked on the sight <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2204</FONT></span></p>

<p>And reverenced at the master's feet; and then, forthwith, the fire burst out. Quenched the fire of grief within; without, the fire has little power to burn. 2205 '</p>

<p>For as the mystic world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (dharma-dh&acirc;tu) is not destroyed, neither can these, the bones (of Buddha), perish; the consequence (fruit) of diamond&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_884"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> wisdom, difficult to move as Sumeru. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2207</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The relics which the mighty golden-pinioned bird cannot remove or change, they place within the precious vase; to remain until the world shall pass away; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2208</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And wonderful! the power of men (the world) can thus fulfil Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a's laws, the illustrious name of one far spread, is sounded thus throughout the universe; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2209</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And as the ages roll, the long Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, by these, the sacred relics (bones), sheds through the world its glorious light, and brightens up the abodes of life. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2210</FONT></span></p>

<p>Thus the diamond substance (body) was dealt with at the place of burning. And now those valiant Mallas, unrivalled in the world for strength, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2213</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Subduing all private animosities, sought escape from sorrow in the true refuge. Finding sweet comfort in united love, they resolved to banish every complaining thought. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2214</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Beholding thus the death of Tath&acirc;gata, they controlled their grieving hearts, and with full strength of manly virtue dismissing every listless thought, they submitted to the course (laws) of nature. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2215</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Oppressed by thoughts of grievous sorrow, they entered the city as a deserted wild, holding the relics thus they entered, whilst from every street were offered gifts. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2216</FONT></span></p>  
<p>They placed the relics then upon a tower&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_886"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for men and Devas to adore. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2217</FONT></span></p>

The end of the great kalpa is the consummation of all things: 'the religious who sleep' would mean the good who are dead; 'the cracking thunder and riven forests' would point to a general overthrow; 'the rain of sweet dew' seems to refer to the good who sleep, receiving immortality, or perfection of life.</P>
