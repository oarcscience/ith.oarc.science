</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">VARGA 26. MAH&Acirc;PARINIRV&Acirc;<I>N</I>A.</h3>  
<p>At this time there was a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin whose name was Su-po-to-lo&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_797"></A><A HREF="#fn_797"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (Subhadra); he was well known for his virtuous qualities (bhadra), leading a pure life according to the rules of morality, and protecting all living things. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1984</FONT></span></p>  
<p>When young&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_798"></A><A HREF="#fn_798"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he had adopted heretical views and become a recluse among unbelievers--this one, wishing to see the lord, spake to &Acirc;nanda thus: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1985</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I hear that the system of Tath&acirc;gata is of a</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_291"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 291</FONT></A></p>  
<p>singular character and very profound (difficult to fathom), and that he (has reached) the highest wisdom (anuttar&acirc;(sam)bodhi) in the world, the first of all horse-tamers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_799"></A><A HREF="#fn_799"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1986</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'(I hear moreover) that he is now about to die (reach Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a), it will be difficult&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_800"></A><A HREF="#fn_800"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> indeed to meet with him again, and difficult to see those who have seen him with difficulty, even as it is to catch in a mirror the reflection of the moon. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1987</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I now desire respectfully to see him the greatest and most virtuous guide (of men), because I seek to escape this mass of sorrow (accumulated sorrow) and reach the other shore of birth and death, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1988</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The sun of Buddha now about to quench its rays, O! let me for a moment gaze upon him.' The feelings of &Acirc;nanda now were much affected, thinking that this request was made with a view to controversy, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1989</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Or that he (i.e. Subhadra) felt an inward joy because the lord was on the eve of death. He was not willing therefore to permit the interview with Buddha (the Buddha-sight). Buddha, knowing the man's (that one's) earnest desire and that he was a vessel fit for true religion (right doctrine), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1990</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Therefore addressed &Acirc;nanda thus: 'Permit that heretic to advance; I was born to save mankind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_801"></A><A HREF="#fn_801"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, make no hindrance therefore or excuse!' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1991</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_292"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 292</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Subhadra, hearing this, was overjoyed at heart, and his religious feelings (his feelings of joy in religion) were much enlarged, as with increased reverence he advanced to Buddha's presence. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1992</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then, as the occasion required&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_802"></A><A HREF="#fn_802"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he spoke becoming words and with politeness made his salutation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_803"></A><A HREF="#fn_803"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, his features pleasing and with hands conjoined (he said): 'Now I desire to ask somewhat from thee; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1993</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The world has many teachers of religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_804"></A><A HREF="#fn_804"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (those who know the law) as I am myself; but I hear that Buddha has attained a way which is the end of all, complete emancipation. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1994</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'O that you would, on my account, briefly explain (your method), moisten my empty, thirsty soul (heart)! not with a view to controversy or from a desire to gain the mastery (but with sincerity I ask you so to do).' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1995</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then Buddha, for the Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin's sake, in brief recounted the eight 'right ways' (noble paths)--on hearing which, his empty soul (meek heart) accepted it, as one deceived accepts direction in the right road. 1996}</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_293"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 293</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Perceiving now, he knew that what he had before perceived was not the final way (of salvation), but now he felt he had attained what he had not before attained, and so he gave up and forsook his books of heresy. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1997</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Moreover, now he rejected (turned his back) on the gloomy hindrances of doubt (moha), reflecting how by his former practices, mixed up with anger, hate, and ignorance, he had long cherished no real (good) joy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_805"></A><A HREF="#fn_805"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1998</FONT></span></p>  
<p>For if (he argued) the ways of lust and hate and ignorance are able to produce a virtuous karman (good works), then 'hearing much' and 'persevering wisdom' (or, wisdom and perseverance (v&icirc;rya)) these, too, are born from lust, (which cannot be.) <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 1999</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But if a man is able to cut down hate and ignorance, then also he puts off all consequences of works (karman), and these being finally destroyed, this is complete emancipation. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2000</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Those thus freed from works are likewise freed from subtle questionings (investigation of subtle principles), (such as) what the world says 'that all things, everywhere, possess a self-nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_806"></A><A HREF="#fn_806"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2001</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But if this be the case and therefore lust, hate, and ignorance possess a self-implanted nature, then this nature must inhere in them; what then means the word 'deliverance?' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2002</FONT></span></p>  
<p>For even if we rightly cause&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_807"></A><A HREF="#fn_807"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the overthrow</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_294"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 294</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (destruction) of hate and ignorance, yet if lust (love) remains, then there is a return of birth; even as water, cold in its nature, may by fire be heated, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2003</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But when the fire goes out then it becomes cold again, because this is its constant nature; so (we may) ever know that the nature which lust has is permanent [or, 'endurance, we may know, is the nature of lust'], and neither hearing, wisdom, or perseverance can alter it. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2004</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Neither capable of increase or diminution, how can there be deliverance? I held aforetime (thus he thought) that (those things capable of) birth and death resulted thus, from their own innate nature; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2005</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But now I see that such a belief excludes deliverance; for what is (born) by nature must endure so, what end can such things have? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2006</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Just as a burning lamp cannot but give its light; the way (doctrine) of Buddha is the only true one, that lust, as the root-cause, brings forth the things that live (the world); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2007</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Destroy this lust (love) then there is Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a (quiet extinction); the cause destroyed then the fruit is not produced. I formerly maintained that 'I' (self) was a distinct entity (body), not seeing that it has no maker. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2008</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But now I hear the right doctrine preached by Buddha, there is no 'self' (personal self) in all the world, for all things are produced by cause, and therefore there is no creator (&Icirc;<I>s</I>vara). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2009</FONT></span></p>  
<p>If then sorrow is produced by cause (or, if then cause producing things, there is sorrow), the cause may likewise be destroyed; for if the world is cause-produced,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_295"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 295</FONT></A></p>  
<p>then is the view correct, that by destruction of the cause, there is an end. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2010</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The cause destroyed, the world brought to an end, there is no room for such a thought as permanence, and therefore all my former views (he said) are 'done away,' and so he deeply 'saw' the true doctrine taught by Buddha. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2011</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Because of seeds well sown in former times, he was enabled thus to understand the law on hearing it; thus he reached the good and perfect state of quietness, the peaceful, never-ending place (of rest). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2012</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His heart expanding to receive the truth, he gazed with earnest look on Buddha as he slept, nor could he bear to see Tath&acirc;gata depart and die (leave the world and attain Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2013</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Ere yet,' he said, 'Buddha shall reach the term (of life) I will myself first leave the world (become extinct);' and then with hands close joined, retiring from the holy form (face or features), he took his seat apart, and sat composed and firm&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_808"></A><A HREF="#fn_808"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2014</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then giving up his life (years), he reached Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, as when the rain puts out a little fire. Then Buddha spake to all his followers (Bhikshus): 'This my very last disciple <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2015</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Has now attained Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, cherish him (his remains) properly.' Then Buddha the first night (watch) passed, the moon bright shining and all the stars clear in their lustre, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2016</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The quiet grove without a sound, moved by his great compassionate heart, declared to his disciples</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_296"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 296</FONT></A></p>  
<p>this his bequeathed precepts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_809"></A><A HREF="#fn_809"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (his testamentary rules). 'After my Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2017</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Ye ought to reverence and obey the Pratimoksha, (receive it) as your master, a shining lamp in the dark night, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2018</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Or as a great jewel (treasured by) a poor man. The injunctions I have ever given, these you ought to obey and follow carefully, and treat in no way different from myself. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2019</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Keep pure your body, words, and conduct, put from you all concerns of daily life (business), lands, houses, cattle, storing wealth or hoarding grain. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2020</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All these should be avoided as we avoid a fiery pit; (so also) sowing the land, cutting down shrubs, healing of wounds or the practice of medicine, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2021</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Star-gazing and astrology, forecasting lucky or unfortunate events by signs (palm signs), prognosticating good or evil, all these are things forbidden. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2022</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Keeping the body temperate, eat at proper times; receive no mission as a go-between; compound no philteries; abhor dissimulation; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2023</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Follow right doctrine, and be kind to all that lives; receive in moderation what is given; receive but hoard not up; these are, in brief, my spoken precepts. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2024</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'These form the groundwork of my rules, these also are the ground of full emancipation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_810"></A><A HREF="#fn_810"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Enabled</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_297"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 297</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thus to live (relying on this law, able to live) this is rightly to receive all (other things). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2025</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'This is true wisdom which embraces all, this is the way (cause) to attain the end; this code of rules, therefore, ye should hold and keep, and never let it slip or be destroyed. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2026</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For when pure rules of conduct are observed (not broken), then there is true religion; without these, virtue languishes; found yourselves therefore well on these my precepts (moral rules); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2027</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Grounded thus in rules of purity, the springs of feeling (animal feeling) will be well controlled, even as the well-instructed cowherd guides well his cattle (permits them neither to loiter nor hurry on). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2028</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Ill-governed feelings (senses), like the horse, run wild through all the six domains of sense, bringing upon us in the present world unhappiness, and in the next, birth in an evil way. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2029</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'So, like the horse ill-broken, these land us in the ditch; therefore the wise and prudent man will not allow his senses licence. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2030</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For these senses (organs of sense) are, indeed, our greatest foes, causes of misery; for men enamoured thus by sensuous things cause all their miseries to recur. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2031</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Destructive as a poisonous snake, or like a savage tiger, or like a raging fire, the greatest evil in the world, he who is wise, is freed from fear of these. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2032</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But what he fears is only this--a light and trivial heart, which drags a man to future misery (evil way</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_298"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 298</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of birth) just for a little sip of pleasure not looking at the yawning gulf (before us); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2033</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Like the wild elephant freed from the iron curb (a&#7749;kusa), or like the ape that has regained the forest trees, such is the light and trivial heart;--the wise man should restrain and hold it therefore. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2034</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Letting the heart go loose without restraint, that man shall not attain Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a; therefore we ought to hold the heart in cheek, and go apart from men and seek a quiet resting-place (hermit's abode). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2035</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Know when to eat and the right measure; and so with reference to the rules of clothing and of medicine; take care you do not by the food you take, encourage in yourselves a covetous or an angry mind. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2036</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Eat your food to satisfy your hunger and (drink to satisfy) your thirst, as we repair an old or broken chariot, or like the butterfly that sips the flower destroying not its fragrance or its texture. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2037</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The Bhikshu, in begging food, should beware of injuring the faithful mind of another&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_811"></A><A HREF="#fn_811"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; if a man opens his heart in charity, think not about his capabilities (i.e. to overtax him), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2038</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For &#8217;tis not well to calculate too closely the strength of the ox, lest by loading him (beyond his strength) you cause him injury. At morning, noon, and night, successively, store up good works. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2039</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'During the first and after watch at night be not overpowered by sleep, but in the middle watch, with heart composed, take sleep (and rest)---be thoughtful towards the dawn of day. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2040</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_299"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 299</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Sleep not the whole night through, making the body and the life relaxed and feeble; think! when the fire shall burn the body always, what length of sleep will then be possible? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2041</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For when the hateful brood of sorrow rising through space, with all its attendant horrors, meeting the mind o&#8217;erwhelmed by sleep and death, shall seize its prey, who then shall waken it? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2042</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The poisonous snake dwelling within a house can be enticed away by proper charms, so the black toad that dwells within his heart, the early waker disenchants and banishes. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2043</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'He who sleeps on heedlessly (without plan), this man has no modesty; but modesty is like a beauteous robe, or like the curb that guides the elephant. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2044</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Modest behaviour keeps the heart composed, without it every virtuous root will die. Who has this modesty, the world applauds (calls him excellent); without it, he is but as any beast. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2045</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If a man with a sharp sword should cut the (another's) body bit by bit (limb by limb), let not an angry thought, or of resentment, rise, and let the mouth speak no ill word. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2046</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Your evil thoughts and evil words but hurt yourself and not another; nothing so full of victory as patience, though your body suffer the pain of mutilation. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2047</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For recollect that he who has this patience cannot be overcome, his strength being so firm; therefore give not way to anger or evil words towards men in power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_812"></A><A HREF="#fn_812"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2048</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_300"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 300</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Anger and hate destroy the true law; and they destroy dignity and beauty of body; as when one dies we lose our name for beauty, so the fire of anger itself burns up the heart. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2049</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Anger is foe to all religious merit, he who loves virtue let him not be passionate; the layman who is angry when oppressed by many sorrows is not wondered at, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2050</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But he who has "left his home&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_813"></A><A HREF="#fn_813"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>" indulging anger, this is indeed opposed to principle, as if in frozen water there were found the heat of fire. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2051</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If indolence (an indolent mind) arises in your heart, then with your own hand smooth down your head&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_814"></A><A HREF="#fn_814"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, shave off your hair, and clad in sombre (dyed or stained) garments, in your hand holding the begging-pot, go ask for food; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2052</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'On every side the living perish, what room for indolence? the worldly man, relying on his substance or his family, indulging in indolence, is wrong; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2053</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'How much more the religious man, whose purpose is to seek the way of rescue, who encourages within an indolent mind; this surely is impossible! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2054</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Crookedness and truth (straightness) are in their nature opposite and cannot dwell together more than frost and fire; for one who has become religious, and practises the way of straight behaviour, a false and crooked way of speech is not becoming. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2055</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'False and flattering speech is like the magician's</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_301"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 301</FONT></A></p>  
<p>art; but he who ponders on religion cannot speak falsely (wildly). To "covet much," brings sorrow; desiring little, there is rest and peace. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2056</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'To procure rest (peace of mind), there must be small desire--much more in case of those who seek deliverance (salvation). The niggard dreads the much-seeking man lest he should filch away his property (wealth and jewels), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2057</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But he who loves to give has also fear, lest he should not possess enough to give; therefore we ought to encourage small desire, that we may have to give to him who wants, without such fear. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2058</FONT></span></p>  
<p>From this desiring-little-mind we find the way of true deliverance; desiring true deliverance (seeking salvation) we ought to practise knowing-enough (contentment). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2059</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'A contented mind is always joyful, but joy like this is but religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_815"></A><A HREF="#fn_815"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; the rich and poor alike, having contentment, enjoy perpetual rest. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2060</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The ill-contented man though he be born to heavenly joys, because he is not contented would ever have a mind burned up by the fire of sorrow. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2061</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The rich, without contentment, endures the pain of poverty; though poor, if yet he be contented, then he is rich indeed! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2062</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'That ill-contented man, the bounds of the five desires extending further still, (becomes) insatiable in his requirements, (and so) through the long night (of life) gathers increasing sorrow. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2063</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Without cessation thus he cherishes his careful (anxious) plans, whilst he who lives contented, freed</p>

<p>from anxious thoughts about relationships (family concerns), his heart is ever peaceful and at rest. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2064</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And so because he rests and is at peace within, the gods and men revere and do him service. Therefore we ought to put away all cares about relationship (the encumbrance of close or distant relationships). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2065</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For like a solitary desert tree in which the birds and monkeys gather. so is it when we are cumbered much with family associations; through the long night we gather many sorrows. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2066</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Many dependents (relationships) are like the many bands (that bind us), or like the old elephant that struggles in the mud. By diligent perseverance a man may get much profit; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2067</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Therefore night and day men ought with ceaseless effort to exert themselves; the tiny streams that trickle down the mountain slopes (valleys) by always flowing eat away the rock. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2068</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If we use not earnest diligence in drilling wood in wood for fire, we shall not obtain the spark, so ought we to be diligent and persevere, as the skilful master drills the wood for fire. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2069</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'A "virtuous friend&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_816"></A><A HREF="#fn_816"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>" though he be gentle is not to be compared with right reflection (thought)--right thought kept well in the mind, no evil thing can ever enter there. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2070</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Wherefore those who practise (a religious life) should always think about "the body" (their true condition--themselves); if thought upon oneself be</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_303"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 303</FONT></A></p>  
<p>absent, then all virtue (virtuous intentions or purposes) dies. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2071</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For as the champion warrior relies for victory upon his armour's strength, so "right thought" is like a strong cuirass able to withstand the six sense-robbers (the robber-objects of the six senses). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2072</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Right faith&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_817"></A><A HREF="#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (sam&acirc;dhi) enwraps&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_818"></A><A HREF="#fn_818"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the enlightened heart, (so that a man) perceives the world throughout (is liable to) birth and death; therefore the religious man should practise "sam&acirc;dhi." <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2073</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Having found peace (quietness and peace) in sam&acirc;dhi, we put an end to all the mass of sorrows, wisdom then can enlighten us, and so we put away the rules by which we acquire (knowledge by the senses). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2074</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'By inward thought and right consideration following with gladness the directions of the "true law," this is the way in which both lay (men of the world) and men who have left their homes (religious men) should walk. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2075</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Across the sea of birth and death, "wisdom" is the handy bark; "wisdom" is the shining lamp that lightens up the dark and gloomy (world). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2076</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'"Wisdom" is the grateful medicine for all the defiling ills [of life] (&acirc;<I>s</I>ravas); "wisdom" is the axe wherewith to level all the tangled (prickly) forest trees of sorrow. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2077</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'"Wisdom" is the bridge that spans the rushing stream of ignorance and lust--therefore, in every</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_304"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 304</FONT></A></p>  
<p>way, by thought and right attention (listening), a man should diligently inure himself to engender "wisdom." <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2078</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Having acquired the threefold&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_819"></A><A HREF="#fn_819"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> wisdom, then, though blind, the eye of wisdom sees throughout; but without wisdom the mind is poor and insincere (false); such things cannot suit (agree with) the man who has left his home. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2079</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Wherefore let the enlightened man lay well to heart that false and fruitless (vain) things become him not, and let him strive with single mind for that pure (refined and excellent) joy which can be found alone in perfect rest and quietude (the place of rest and peace, i.e. Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2080</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Above all things be not careless, for carelessness is the chief foe of virtue; if a man avoid this fault he may be born where <I>S</I>akra-r&acirc;<I>g</I>a dwells. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2081</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'He who gives way to carelessness of mind must have his lot where the Asuras dwell.

<p>'On your parts be diligent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_821"></A><A HREF="#fn_821"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (earnest)! with virtuous purpose practise well these rules (works), in quiet solitude of desert hermitage nourish and cherish a still and peaceful heart. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2083</FONT></span></p>

<p>'Exert yourselves to the utmost, give no place to remissness, for as in worldly matters when the considerate physician prescribes fit medicine for the disease he has detected, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2084</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Should the sick man neglect to use it, this cannot be the physician's fault, so I have told you (now) the truth, and set before you this the one and level road (the road of plain duty). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2085</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Hearing my words and not with care obeying them, this is not the fault of him who speaks; if there be anything not clearly understood in the principles of the "four truths," <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2086</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'You now may ask me, freely; let not your inward thoughts be longer hid.' The lord in mercy thus instructing them, the whole assembly remained silent. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2087</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then Anuruddha, observing that the great congregation continued silent and expressed no doubt, with closed hands thus spake to Buddha: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2088</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The moon may be warm, the sun's rays be cool, the air be still&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_822"></A><A HREF="#fn_822"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the earth's nature mobile; these four things, though yet unheard of its the world, (may happen); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2089</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But this assembly never can have doubt about the principles of sorrow, accumulation, destruction, and the way (the four truths)--the incontrovertible truths, as declared by the lord. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2090</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But because the lord is going to die, we all have sorrow (are deeply affected); and we cannot raise our thoughts to the high theme of the lord's preaching. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2091</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Perhaps some fresh disciple, whose feelings are</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_306"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 306</FONT></A></p>  
<p>yet not entirely freed (from other influences) [might doubt]; but we, who now have heard this tender, sorrowful discourse, have altogether freed ourselves from doubt. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2092</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Passed the sea of birth and death, without desire, with nought <I>t</I>o seek, we only know how much we love, and, grieving, ask, why Buddha dies so quickly?' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2093</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Buddha regarding Anuruddha, perceiving how his words were full of bitterness (sorrow-laden), again with loving heart, appeasing him, replied: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2094</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'In the beginning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_823"></A><A HREF="#fn_823"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> things were fixed, in the end again they separate; different combinations cause other substances, for there is no uniform and constant principle (in nature). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2095</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But when all mutual purposes be answered (what is for oneself and for another, be done), what then shall chaos and creation do! the gods and men alike that should be saved, shall all have been completely saved! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2096</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Ye then! my followers, who know so well the perfect law, remember! the end must come (complete destruction of the universe must come); give not way again to sorrow! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2097</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Use diligently the appointed means; aim to reach the home where separation cannot come; I have lit the lamp of wisdom, its rays alone can drive away the gloom that shrouds the world. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2098</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The world is not for ever fixed! Ye should</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_307"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 307</FONT></A></p>  
<p>rejoice therefore! as when a friend, afflicted grievously, his sickness healed, escapes from pain. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2099</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'For I have put away this painful vessel (my painful body), I have stemmed the flowing sea (sea current) of birth and death, free for ever now, from pain (the mass of sorrow)! for this you should exult with joy! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2100</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Now guard yourselves aright, let there be no remissness! that which exists will all return to nothingness! and now I die. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2101</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'From this time forth my words are done, this is my very last instruction.' Then entering the Sam&acirc;dhi of the first Dhy&acirc;na, he went successively through all the nine in a direct order; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2102</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then inversely he returned throughout and entered on the first, and then from the first he raised himself and entered on the fourth. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2103</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Leaving the state of Sam&acirc;dhi, his soul without a resting-place (a house to lodge in), forthwith he reached Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a. And then, as Buddha died, the great earth quaked throughout. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2104</FONT></span></p>  
<p>In space, on every hand, was fire like rain (it rained fire) [or, possibly, 'there was rain and fire'], no fuel, self-consuming&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_824"></A><A HREF="#fn_824"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And so from out the earth great flames arose on every side (the eight points of the earth), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2105</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus up to the heavenly mansions flames burst forth; the crash of thunder shook the heavens and earth, rolling along the mountains and the valleys, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2106</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Even as when the Devas and Asuras fight with sound of drums and mutual conflict. A wind tempestuous from the four bounds of earth arose--</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_308"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 308</FONT></A></p>  
<p>whilst from the crags and hills, dust and ashes fell like rain. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2107</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The sun and moon withdrew their shining; the peaceful streams on every side were torrent-swollen; the sturdy forests shook like aspen leaves, whilst flowers and leaves untimely fell around, like scattered rain. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2108</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The flying dragons, carried on pitchy clouds, wept down their tears&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_825"></A><A HREF="#fn_825"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (five-headed tears); the four kings and their associates, moved by pity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_826"></A><A HREF="#fn_826"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, forgot their works of charity. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2109</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The pure Devas came to earth from heaven, halting mid-air they looked upon the changeful scene (or, the death scene), not sorrowing, not rejoicing. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2110</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But yet they sighed to think of the world, heedless of its sacred teacher, hastening to destruction. The eightfold heavenly spirits&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_827"></A><A HREF="#fn_827"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, on every side filled space, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2111</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Cast down at heart and grieving, they scattered flowers as offerings. Only M&acirc;ra-r&acirc;<I>g</I>a rejoiced, and struck up sounds of music in his exultation. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2112</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Whilst <I>G</I>ambudv&icirc;pa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_828"></A><A HREF="#fn_828"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, shorn of its glory, (seemed. to grieve) as when the mountain tops fall down to earth, or like the great elephant robbed of its tusks, or like the ox-king spoiled of his horns; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2113</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Or heaven without the sun and moon, or as the lily beaten by the hail; thus was the world bereaved when Buddha died! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 2114</FONT></span></p>
