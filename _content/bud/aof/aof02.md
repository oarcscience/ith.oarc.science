# THE AWAKENING OF FAITH

## OPENING HYMN

I yield my life to the All,  
To the All, SOUL, full of good,  
In wisdom all complete,  
In power all divine,  
In pity--would save all.

To LAW which does embody  
The Archetype of all.

To CHURCH which does contain  
The Archetype in Seed,

That men may be delivered  
From doubt and evil ways;  
Get Faith in the Great School  
Perpetuating God!
