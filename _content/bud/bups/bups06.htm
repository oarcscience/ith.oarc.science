<p>71. That Lord that was made flesh in India, the Lord of great pity, showing unto Vaidehi, Queen of Magadha, the golden mirror created by his marvellous power, commanded her to choose the Land of Pure Joy among all the worlds therein appearing.</p>  
<p>72. Binbisara, he who commanded that an ascetic should be slain before his pre-ordained time was come, by his own son was imprisoned in a seven-walled prison as the due recompense of his violence.</p>  
<p>73. Aj&#257;ta-&#352;atru, prince and heir of Magadha, denouncing his mother as a traitor, with drawn sword ran furiously upon her.</p>  
<p>74. Then said J&#299;vaka the minister and another with him: "This act is worthy only of an outcast. For the fame of our race unworthy art thou to dwell in the Palace." And earnestly did they counsel him to change his evil purpose.</p>  
<p>75. Laying his hand on his sword-hilt, J&#299;vaka, the minister, drew backwards a few steps, steadfastly regarding the prince, that he might avert</p>  
<p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></A></p>  
<p>this great sin. And so it was that the prince laid down his sword, and secluded his mother in a palace.</p>  
<p>76. Certain is it that Ananda with Vaidehi, Devadatta and yet others, bearing their part in this great sorrow of the royal palace of Magadha, must needs so suffer that they might know the infinite pity of the Blessed One, that Lord who in this world made manifest the true teaching.</p>  
<p>77. And all these wise ones having so received instruction revealed unto us, who are of all evildoers worst, the true way, the refuge of His divine promise that absolveth all the sins of men.</p>  
<p>78. For when the full time was come that by the will of our Lord and of Vaidehi the teaching of the Pure Land should be made known here on Earth, Aj&#257;ta-&#352;atru, her son, sinned this sin, Varshakara his minister bearing testimony against it.</p>  
<p>79. It is needful that the heart of a man be opened unto the Faith universal which He who is Blessed hath shown us, forsaking the belief that his own works shall save him, for in every man the power to perform righteous deeds is differing.</p>
