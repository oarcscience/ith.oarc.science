<p align="center"><b>IN PRAISE OF PRINCE SHOTOKU</b></p>  
<p>316. Through the compassion of Shotoku the great prince we, having accepted the Divine Promise sprung from the unsearchable wisdom of the Illuminated One, are made equal unto Maitreya. Bodhisattva&#8212;the Buddha that shall be&#8212;having been united unto those men who return no more to birth and death.</p>  
<p>317. The mighty Bodhisattva of Compassion, he who is the Saviour, was made manifest in this world as Shotoku the Prince, who, like a father, hath not forsaken us, and like a mother is ever amongst us.</p>  
<p>318. From that past where was no beginning until the day that now is, hath Shotoku the great prince, the Compassionate, dwelt among us like unto a father and a mother.</p>  
<p>319. Shotoku the Prince, from his Compassion, hath persuaded us to enter in at the Divine Promise of the wondrous wisdom of the Light-Bearer. And through this are we joined unto those men who return no more unto birth and death.</p>  
<p>320. Whoso attaineth unto the holy faith that is</p>  
<p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></A></p>  
<p>the power of divinity, must, in the Ten Regions of the world, find the twofold gift of the Enlightened One, that he may live in thankfulness for His grace.</p>  
<p>321. Shotoku, he who is mercy's self, the Compassionate, he who is like unto a father, and the Bodhisattva of Mercy, the divine tenderness, his succour is merciful as the pity of a mother.</p>  
<p>322. Testimony is there that Shotoku the prince hath mercy upon us, from the myriads of Kalpas even unto this day, because the wondrous wisdom of Him who is Light beareth the load of his debt for the believer.</p>  
<p>Therefore before the eyes of His wisdom is the evil as the good, the pure as the unclean.</p>  
<p>323. Shotoku, the Prince, he that is in Japan called the Lord of Teaching, he whose great mercy overtops all spoken words of gratitude, must we therefore praise for evermore, having with single heart sought refuge in him.</p>  
<p>324. He who hath pitied the dwellers in the lands of Japan, the Prince of Jogu, he whose ways are merciful, hath spread abroad the Divine Promise of the Enlightened One. Therefore let us praise him with great rejoicing. Throughout</p>  
<p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></A></p>  
<p>the many myriads of Kalpas, birth after birth fell hitherto upon us.</p>  
<p>325. We to whom he showed forth his compassion must be swift to praise him, having continually sought refuge in him, and with a single mind.</p>  
<p>326. The high Prince Shotoku, he who hath guarded us and with great carefulness led us upwards from remotest times, hath lovingly entreated us to seek our refuge in the two-fold gift of the Enlightened One.</p>
