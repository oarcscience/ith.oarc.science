<p>129. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">All</span> fear the rod, all quake at death. Judge then by thyself, and forbear from slaughter, or from causing to slay.</p>  
<p>130. To all is life dear. Judge then by thyself, and forbear to slay or to cause slaughter.</p>  
<p>131. Whoso himself desires joy, yet hurts them who love joy, shall not obtain it hereafter.</p>  
<p>132. Whoso himself desires joy and hurts not them who love it, shall hereafter attain to joy.</p>  
<p>133. Speak not harshly to any one: else will men turn upon you. Sad are the words of strife: retribution will follow them.</p>  
<p>134. Be silent as a broken gong: so wilt thou reach peace; for strife is not found in thee.</p>  
<p>135. As the herdsman drives out his cows to the pasture, so Old Age and Death drive out the life of men.</p>  
<p>136. Verily the fool sins and knows it not: by his own deeds is the fool tormented as by fire.</p>  
<p>137. He who strikes those who strike not</p>

<p>and are innocent will come speedily to one of these ten states:</p>  
<p>138. To cruel torment, loss, accident, severe illness, and madness he will come:</p>  
<p>139. To visitation from the King, grievous slander, loss of kith and kin, and perishing of his wealth he will come:</p>  
<p>140. Ravaging fire will destroy his houses, and after death the poor wretch will go to hell.</p>  
<p>141. Not nakedness, nor matted hair, not dirt, nor fastings, not sleeping in sanctuaries, nor ashes, nor ascetic posture&#8212;none of these things purifies a man who is not free from doubt.</p>  
<p>142. If even a fop fosters the serene mind, calm and controlled, pious and pure, and does no hurt to any living thing, he is the Brahmin he is the Samana, he is the Bhikkhu.</p>  
<p>143. Is there in all the world a man so modest that he provokes no blame, as a noble steed never deserves the whip? As a noble steed stung by the whip, be ye spirited and swift.</p>  
<p>144. By faith, by righteousness, by manliness, by meditation, by just judgment, by theory and practice, by mindfulness, leave aside sorrow&#8212;no slight burden.</p>  
<p>145. Engineers control the water, fletchers fashion their shafts, carpenters shape the wood: it is themselves that the pious fashion and control.</p>
