### § XXII

#### HELL

306\. <span class="smallcaps">The</span> liar goes to hell, and the
villain who denies his crime; these mean ones are alike in the world
beyond.

307\. Though clad in yellow robe, the man of many sins who is
uncontrolled is born in hell: the sinner is punished by his sin.

308\. Better to swallow a ball of red-hot iron than to live uncontrolled
upon the bounty of the faithful.

309\. Four evil consequences follow the sluggard and the adulterer:
retribution, broken slumber, an evil name, and in the end hell.

310\. That way lie retribution and an evil character, the short-lived
joy of trembling sinners, and a heavy penalty from the ruler. Therefore
run not after thy neighbour's wife.

311\. As pampas-grass clumsily handled cuts the hand, so is the
community life: abused, it brings a man to hell.

312\. All duties carelessly performed; all vows

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

slightingly observed; the recluse life that is open to suspicion—these
bear no great fruit.

313\. If a duty is to be done, do it with thy might: a careless recluse
scatters contagion broadcast.

314\. Better leave undone a bad deed; one day the doer will lament: good
it is to do the good deed which brings no remorse.

315\. As a fortress guarded within and without, so guard thyself. Leave
no loophole for attack! They who fail at their post mourn here, and
hereafter go to hell.

316\. Some are ashamed at what is not shameful, and blush not at deeds
of shame: these perverse ones go to hell.

317\. They who see fear where there is no fear, and tremble not at
fearful things: these perverse ones go to hell.

318\. They who think evil where there is no evil, and make light of
grievous sin: these perverse ones go to hell.

319\. But whoso calls sin sin, and innocence innocence: these
right-minded ones go to happiness.
