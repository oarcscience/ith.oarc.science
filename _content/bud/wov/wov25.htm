<p>290. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">If</span> at the cost of a little joy one sees great joy, he who is wise will look to the greater and leave the less.</p>  
<p>291. Whoso seeks his own pleasure by another's pain, is entangled in hate and cannot get free.</p>  
<p>292. Duty neglected; evil done: the taints of the proud and slothful wax ever more and more.</p>  
<p>293. But those who are ever pondering the nature of the body, who run not after evil, who are constant in duty&#8212;in these, the vigilant and wise, taints come utterly to an end.</p>  
<p>294. Having destroyed Mother and Father and two noble Kings, with the whole Kingdom and its Vizier, innocent goes the Brahmin!</p>  
<p>295. Innocent goes the Brahmin having destroyed Mother and Father and two Brahmin Kings, and the five Roads and their fierce guardians.</p>  
<p>296. The followers of Gautama are evervigilant; their thought day and night is set upon Buddha.</p>  
<p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></A></p>  
<p>297-301. The followers of Gautama are ever vigilant; day and night is their thought set upon the Dhamma, the Sangha, the body, compassion (not harming), mind-culture.</p>  
<p>302. Hard it is to leave home as a recluse! hard also to live at home as a householder; hard is the community life; the lot of the wanderer in the world is also hard.</p>  
<p>303. The faithful, upright man is endowed with (the true) fame and wealth, and is honoured wherever he goes.</p>  
<p>304. Far off are seen the Holy Ones, like the Him&#257;layas: the unholy pass unseen as arrows shot in the darkness.</p>  
<p>305. Alone when eating, alone when sleeping, alone when walking, let a man strongly control himself and take his pleasure in the forest glade.</p>
