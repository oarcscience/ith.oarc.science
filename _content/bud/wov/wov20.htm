<p>209. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span> who gives himself to vanity and not to the truly profitable, shunning the true pursuit, and grasping at pleasure, will come to envy him who has sought the true profit.</p>  
<p>210. Let no man cleave to what is pleasant or unpleasant: parting with the pleasant is pain, and painful is the presence of the unpleasant.</p>  
<p>211. Take a liking to nothing; loss of the prize is evil. There are no bonds for him who has neither likes nor dislikes.</p>  
<p>212. From attachment comes grief, from attachment comes fear. He who is pure from attachment knows neither grief nor fear.</p>  
<p>213. From affection come grief and fear. He who is without affection knows neither grief nor fear.</p>  
<p>214. From pleasure come grief and fear. He who is freed from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear.</p>  
<p>215. From lust come grief and fear. He who is freed from lust knows neither grief nor fear.</p>  
<p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></A></p>  
<p>216. From desire come grief and fear. He who is free of desire knows neither grief nor fear.</p>  
<p>217. The man of counsel and insight, of righteousness and truth, who minds his own affairs, him the crowd holds dear.</p>  
<p>218. If a man's heart be set upon the Ineffable (Nirv&#257;na), his mind brought to perfection, and every thought freed from lust, he is called the strong swimmer who forges his way against the stream.</p>  
<p>219. When, after long voyaging afar, one returns in safety home, kinsfolk and friends receive him gladly;</p>  
<p>220. Even so his good deeds receive the good man, when he leaves this world for the next, as kinsfolk greet a dear traveller.</p>
