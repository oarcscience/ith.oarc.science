### § XII

#### SELF

157\. <span class="smallcaps">If</span> a man love himself, let him
diligently watch himself: the wise will keep vigil for one of the three
watches of the night.

158\. Keep first thyself aright: then mayest thou advise others. So is
the wise man unblameable.

159\. If one so shapes his own life as he directs others, himself
controlled, he will duly control others: self, they say, is hard to
tame.

160\. A man is his own helper; who else is there to help? By
self-control man is a rare help to himself.

161\. The ill that is begun and has its growth and its being in self,
bruises the foolish one, as the diamond pierces its own matrix.

162\. As the creeper overpowers the tree, so he whose sin is great,
works for himself the havoc his enemy would wish for him.

163\. Ill is easy to do; it is easy to do harm: hard indeed it is to do
helpful and good deeds.

164\. Whoso fondly repudiates the teaching

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

of the noble and virtuous Arahats, following false doctrine, is like the
bamboo which bears fruit to its own destruction.

165\. Thou art brought low by the evil thou hast done thyself; by the
evil thou hast left undone art thou purified. Purity and impurity are
things of man's inmost self; no man can purify another.

166\. Even for great benefit to another let no man imperil his own
benefit. When he has realised what is for his own good, let him pursue
that earnestly.
