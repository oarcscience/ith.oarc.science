<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Happiness</span> is for Gautama, as for Aristotle, "the bloom upon virtue." The path which leads to the Supreme Bliss is the path of morality defined as the Noble Eightfold Path. If a man follow this, he is happy here and hereafter.</p>  
<p>It consists of:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Right Views,</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Right Aspirations,</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Right Speech,</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Right Action,</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Right Livelihood,</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Right Effort,</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Right Mindfulness,</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Right Contemplation.</div></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> This is described by Gautama as a Middle Path between the extreme of sensuality on the one hand and asceticism on the other; or between superstitious credulity and sceptical materialism. It is a truly noble ideal: yet one must never forget that "Righteousness" throughout is Buddhistically defined: <i>e.g.</i> "Right Views"</p>  
<p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></A></p>  
<p>means a correct grasp of the Buddhist teaching that all is transient, all is sorrowful, all is unreal. Again, "Right Contemplation" is the practice of Sam&#257;dhi, concentration of the mind upon Buddhist ideas, such as the above. The highest "Livelihood," again, is to live upon the alms of the faithful.</p>  
<p>273. Best of paths is the Eightfold; the four truths are the best of truths: purity is the best state; best of men is the seer.</p>  
<p>274. This is the way; there is none other that leads to the seeing of Purity (Nirv&#257;na.) Do you follow this path: that is to befool Mara.</p>  
<p>275. Travelling by this way you'll end your grief: it is the way I preached when I learnt to throw off my bonds.</p>  
<p>276. &#8217;Tis you who must strive: the Blessed Ones are only preachers. They who strive and meditate are freed from Mara's bonds.</p>  
<p>277. "All is passing": when one sees and realises this, he sits loose to this world of sorrow: this is the way of purity.</p>  
<p>278. "All is sorrow": when one sees and realises this, he sits loose to this world of sorrow; this is the way of purity.</p>  
<p>279. "All is unreal": when one sees and realises this, he sits loose to this world of sorrow this is the way of purity.</p>  
<p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></A></p>  
<p>280. He who fails to strive when &#8217;tis time to strive, young and strong though he be, slothful and enmeshed in lust, the sluggard, never finds the path to wisdom.</p>  
<p>281. Whoso guards his tongue and controls his mind and does nothing wrong: keeping clear these three paths, he will achieve the way shown by the wise.</p>  
<p>282. From meditation springs wisdom; from neglect of it the loss of wisdom. Knowing this path of progress and decline, choose the way that leads to growth of wisdom.</p>  
<p>283. Cut down the jungle (I do not mean with an axe!). For from the jungle of lust springs fear, and if you cut it down, you will be disentangled, O Bhikkhus!</p>  
<p>284. Whilst the entanglement of a man with a woman is not utterly cut away, he is in bondage, running to her as a sucking calf to the cow.</p>  
<p>285. Pluck out the bond of self as one pulls up an autumn lotus. Forge thy way along the path of safety, Nirv&#257;na, shown by the Blessed.</p>  
<p>286. "Here will I pass the wet season; here the winter and summer," thinks the fool, unmindful of what may befall.</p>  
<p>287. Then comes Death and sweeps him away infatuated with children and cattle, and entangled with this world's goods, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.</p>  
<p>288. There is no safety in sons, or in father,</p>  
<p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></A></p>  
<p>or in kinsfolk when Death overshadows thee: amongst thine own kith and kin is no refuge:</p>  
<p>289. Knowing this clearly, the wise and righteous man straightway clears the road that leads to Nirv&#257;na.</p>
