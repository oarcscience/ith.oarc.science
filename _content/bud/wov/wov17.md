### § XIII

#### THE WORLD

167\. <span class="smallcaps">Let</span> no man foster evil habits; let
no man live in sloth: let none follow false doctrines, none prolong his
sojourn in this world.

168\. Up! Idle not, but follow after good. The good man lives happy in
this world and the next.

169\. Follow after virtue, not after vice. The virtuous live happy in
this world and the next.

170\. The king of Death sees not him who regards the world as a bubble,
a mirage.

171\. Come then, think of the world as a painted chariot of the king—a
morass where fools are sinking, where the wise take no pleasure.

172\. He who in former days was slothful, and has put off sloth, lights
up the world as the moon freed of the clouds.

173\. He who covers his idle deeds with goodness lights up the world as
the moon freed of clouds.

174\. Blinded are the men of this world; few there are who have eyes to
see: few are the

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

birds which escape the fowler's net; few are they who go to heaven.

175\. Through the sky fly the swans: Rishis too pass through the air.
The wise leave the world altogether, deserting Mara and his hosts.

176\. There is no wrong he would not do who breaks one precept, speaking
lies and mocking at the life to come.

177\. Misers go not to the realm of gods: therefore he is a fool who
does not delight in liberality. The wise delighting in liberality come
thereby with gladness to the other world.

178\. Good is kingship of the earth; good is birth in heaven; good is
universal empire; better still is the fruit of conversion.
