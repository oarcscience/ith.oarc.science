<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">For</span> the proper understanding of Buddhism these opening stanzas are all-important. One of the Buddha's key-thoughts was what modern psychologists call the "law of apperception": the value of things depends upon our attitude to them.</p>  
<p>Part of Gautama's work of reform was a "transvaluation of values," a shifting of emphasis; and, like the Stoics, he taught the indifference of the things of sense. "Men are disturbed," said Epictetus, "not by things, but by the view they take of things."</p>  
<p>1. Mind it is which gives to things their quality, their foundation, and their being: whoso speaks or acts with impure mind, him sorrow dogs, as the wheel follows the steps of the draught-ox.</p>  
<p>2. Mind it is which gives to things their quality,</p>  
<p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></A></p>  
<p>their foundation, and their being: whoso speaks or acts with purified mind, him happiness accompanies as his faithful shadow.</p>  
<p>3. "He has abused me, beaten me, worsted me, robbed me"; those who dwell upon such thoughts never lose their hate.</p>  
<p>4. "He has abused me, beaten me, worsted me, robbed me "; those who dwell: not upon such thoughts are freed of hate.</p>  
<p>5. Never does hatred cease by hating; by not hating does it cease: this is the ancient law.</p>  
<p>6. If some there are who know not by such hatred we are perishing, and some there are who know it, then by their knowledge strife is ended.</p>  
<p>7. As the wind throws down a shaky tree, so Mara (Death) o&#8217;erwhelms him who is a seeker after vanity, uncontrolled, intemperate, slothful, and effeminate.</p>  
<p>8. But whoso keeps his eyes from vanity, controlled and temperate, faithful and strenuous, Mara cannot overthrow, as the wind beating against a rocky crag.</p>  
<p>9. Though an impure man don the pure yellow robe (of the Bhikkhu), himself unindued with temperance and truth, he is not worthy of the pure yellow robe.</p>  
<p>10. He who has doffed his impurities, calm and clothed upon with temperance and truth, he wears the pure robe worthily.</p>  
<p>11. Those who mistake the shadow for the</p>  
<p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></A></p>  
<p>substance, and the substance for the shadow, never attain the reality, following wandering fires (lit. followers of a false pursuit).</p>  
<p>12. But if a man knows the substance and the shadow as they are, he attains the reality, following the true trail.</p>  
<p>13. As the rain pours into the ill-thatched house, so lust pours into the undisciplined mind.</p>  
<p>14. As rain cannot enter the well-thatched house, so lust finds no entry into the disciplined mind.</p>  
<p>15. Here and hereafter the sinner mourns: yea mourns and is in torment, knowing the vileness of his deeds.</p>  
<p>16. Here and hereafter the good man is glad: yea is glad and rejoices, knowing that his deeds are pure.</p>  
<p>17. Here and hereafter the sinner is in torment: tormented by the thought "I have sinned"; yea rather tormented when he goes to hell.</p>  
<p>18. Here and hereafter the good man rejoices; rejoices as he thinks "I have done well": yea rather rejoices when he goes to a heaven.</p>  
<p>19. If a man is a great preacher of the sacred text, but slothful and no doer of it, he is a hireling shepherd, who has no part in the flock.</p>  
<p>20. If a man preaches but a little of the text and practises the teaching, putting away lust and hatred and infatuation; if he is truly wise and detached and seeks nothing here or hereafter, his lot is with the holy ones.</p>
