### § VII

#### THE ARAHAT

90\. <span class="smallcaps">No</span> remorse is found in him whose
journey is accomplished, whose sorrow ended, whose freedom complete,
whose chains are all shaken off.

91\. The mindful press on, casting no look behind to their home-life; as
swans deserting a pool they leave their dear home.

92\. Some there are who have no treasure here, temperate ones whose goal
is the freedom which comes of realising that life is empty and
impermanent: their steps are hard to track as the flight of birds
through the sky.

93\. He whose taints are purged away, who is indifferent to food, whose
goal is the freedom which comes of realising life's emptiness and
transciency, is hard to track as the flight of birds in the sky.

94\. Even the gods emulate him whose senses are quiet as horses
well-tamed by the charioteer, who has renounced self-will, and put away
all taints.

95\. No more will he be born whose patience

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

is as the earth's, who is firm as a pillar and pious, pure as some
unruffled lake.

96\. Calm is the thought, calm the words and deeds of such a one, who
has by wisdom attained true freedom and self-control.

97\. Excellent is the man who is not credulous, who knows Nirvāna, who
has cut all bonds, destroyed the germs of rebirth, cast off lust.

98\. In the village or the jungle, on sea or land, wherever lives the
Arahat, there is the place of delight.

99\. Pleasant are the glades where the herd come not to disport
themselves: there shall the Holy take their pleasure, who seek not after
lust.
