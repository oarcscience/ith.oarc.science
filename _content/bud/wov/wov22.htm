<p>235. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thou</span> art withered as a sere leaf: Death's messengers await thee. Thou standest at the gate of death, and hast made no provision for the journey.</p>  
<p>236. Make to thyself a refuge; come, strive and be prudent: when thy impurities are purged, thou shalt come into the heavenly abode of the Noble.</p>  
<p>237. Thy life is ended; thou art come into the Presence of Death: there is no resting-place by the way, and thou hast no provision for the journey.</p>  
<p>238. Make for thyself a refuge; come, strive and play the sage! Burn off thy taints, and thou shalt know birth and old age no more.</p>  
<p>239. As a smith purifies silver in the fire, so bit by bit continually the sage burns away his impurities.</p>  
<p>240. It is the iron's own rust that destroys it: it is the sinner's own acts that bring him to hell.</p>  
<p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></A></p>  
<p>241. Disuse is the rust of mantras; laziness the rust of households; sloth is the rust of beauty; neglect is the watcher's ruin.</p>  
<p>242. Impurity is the ruin of woman; and avarice the ruin of the giver: ill-deeds are the rust of this world and the next.</p>  
<p>243. More corrosive than those is the rust of ignorance, the greatest of taints: put off this rust and be clean, O Bhikkhus.</p>  
<p>244. Life is easy for the crafty and shameless, for the wanton, shrewd, and impure:</p>  
<p>245. Hard it is for the modest, the lover of purity, the disinterested and simple and clean, the man of insight.</p>  
<p>246, 247. The murderer, the liar, the thief, the adulterer, and the drunkard&#8212;these even in this world uproot themselves.</p>  
<p>248. Know this, O man, evil is the undisciplined mind! See to it that greed and lawlessness bring not upon thee long suffering.</p>  
<p>249. Men give according to faith or caprice. If a man fret because food and drink are given to another, he comes not day or night to serene meditation (<i>i.e.</i> Sam&#257;dhi).</p>  
<p>250. He in whom this (envious spirit) is destroyed and wholly uprooted, he truly day and night attains serene meditation.</p>  
<p>251. There is no fire like lust, no ravenous beast like hatred, no snare like folly, no flood like desire.</p>  
<p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></A></p>  
<p>252. To see another's fault is easy: to see one's own is hard. Men winnow the faults of others like chaff: their own they hide as a crafty gambler hides a losing throw.</p>  
<p>253. The taints of this man are ever growing. He is far from the purification of taints (Arahatship), the censorious one who is ever blaming others.</p>  
<p>254. There is no path through the sky: there is no "religious" apart from us. The world without delights in dalliance: the Blessed Ones are freed from this thrall.</p>  
<p>255. There is no path through the sky; there is no "religious" apart from us. Nothing in the phenomenal world is lasting; but Buddhas endure immovable.</p>
