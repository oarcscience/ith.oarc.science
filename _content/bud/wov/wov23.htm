<p>256, 257. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hasty</span> judgment shows no man just. He is called just who discriminates between right and wrong, who judges others not hastily, but with righteous and calm judgment, a wise guardian of the law.</p>  
<p>258. Neither is a man wise by much speaking: he is called wise who is forgiving, kindly, and fearless.</p>  
<p>259. A man is not a pillar of the law for his much speaking: he who has heard only part of the law and keeps it indeed, he is a pillar of the law and does not slight it.</p>  
<p>260. No man is made an "elder" by his grey locks; mere old age is called empty old age.</p>  
<p>261. He is called "elder" in whom dwell truth and righteousness, harmlessness and self-control and self-mastery, who is without taint and wise.</p>  
<p>262. Not by mere eloquence or comeliness is a man a "gentleman," who is lustful, a miser, and a knave.</p>  
<p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></A></p>  
<p>263. But he in whom these faults are uprooted and done away, the wise and pure is called a gentleman.</p>  
<p>264. Not by his shaven crown is one made a "religious" who is intemperate and dishonourable. How can he be a "religious" who is full of lust and greed?</p>  
<p>265. He who puts off entirely great sins and small faults&#8212;by such true religion is a man called "religious."</p>  
<p>266. Not merely by the mendicant life is a man known as a mendicant: he is not a mendicant because he follows the law of the flesh;</p>  
<p>267. But because, being above good and evil, he leads a pure life and goes circumspectly.</p>  
<p>268, 269. Not by silence (mona) is a man a sage (muni) if he be ignorant and foolish: he who holds as it were the balance, taking the good and rejecting the bad, he is the sage: he who is sage for both worlds, he is the true sage.</p>  
<p>270. A man is no warrior who worries living things: by not worrying is a man called warrior.</p>  
<p>271, 272. Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning, nor by meditation nor by solitude have I won to that peace which no worldling knows. Rest not content with these, O Bhikkhus, until you have reached the destruction of all taints.</p>
