<p>221. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Put</span> away anger, eschew self-will, conquer every bond; no suffering touches him who does not cling to phenomenal existence, but calls nothing his own.</p>  
<p>222. Whoso controls his rising anger as a running chariot, him I call the charioteer: the others only hold the reins.</p>  
<p>223. By calmness let a man overcome wrath; let him overcome evil by good; the miser let him subdue by liberality, and the liar by truth.</p>  
<p>224. Speak the truth, be not angry, give of thy poverty to the suppliant: by these three virtues a man attains to the company of the gods.</p>  
<p>225. The innocent, the sages, those whose action is controlled, these go to the eternal state where they know not sorrow (Nirv&#257;na).</p>  
<p>226. All taints pass away from them who are ever vigilant and active day and night, with faces set towards Nirv&#257;na.</p>  
<p>227. This is an ancient law, O Atula, not the jaw of a day; men blame the silent and they</p>  
<p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></A></p>  
<p>blame the talker; even the man of few words they blame. No one in the world gets off unblamed.</p>  
<p>228. There never was, nor will be, nor is there now to be found, one wholly blamed or wholly praised.</p>  
<p>229, 230. But who is worthy to blame him whom the wise praise after daily scrutiny, who is himself wise and without blemish as a medal of purest gold? Even the gods seek to emulate such a one; even Brahma praises him.</p>  
<p>231. Guard against evil deeds: control the body. Eschew evil deeds and do good.</p>  
<p>232. Guard against evil words; control the tongue. Eschew evil words and speak good ones.</p>  
<p>233. Guard against evil thoughts; control the mind. Eschew evil thoughts and think good ones.</p>  
<p>234. The wise, controlled in act, in word, in thought, are well controlled indeed.</p>
