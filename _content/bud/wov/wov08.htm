<p>44. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Who</span> shall conquer this world, and the realm of Death with its attendant gods? Who shall sort the verses of the well-preached Law, as a clever weaver of garlands sorts flowers?</p>  
<p>45. My disciple shall conquer this world and Death with its attendant gods: it is he who shall sort the verses of the well-preached Law as a clever garland-maker sorts flowers.</p>  
<p>46. Let him escape the eye of Mara, regarding his body as froth, knowing it as a mirage, plucking out the flowery shafts of Mara.</p>  
<p>47. He who is busy culling pleasures, as one plucks flowers, Death seizes and hurries off, as a great flood bears away a sleeping village.</p>  
<p>48. The Destroyer treads him underfoot as he is culling worldly pleasures, still unsated with lusts of the flesh.</p>  
<p>49. As a bee taking honey from flowers, without hurt to bloom or scent, so let the sage seek his food from house to house.</p>  
<p>60. Be not concerned with other men's evil</p>  
<p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></A></p>  
<p>words or deeds or neglect of good: look rather to thine own sins and negligence (lit. "sins of commission and omission": things done and undone).</p>  
<p>51. As some bright flower&#8212;fair to look at, but lacking fragrance&#8212;so are fair words which bear no fruit in action.</p>  
<p>52. As some bright flower, fragrant as it is fair, so are fair words whose fruit is seen in action.</p>  
<p>53. As if from a pile of flowers one were to weave many a garland, so let mortals string together much merit.</p>  
<p>54. No scent of flower is borne against the wind, though it were sandal, or incense or jasmine: but the fragrance of the holy is borne against the wind: the righteous pervade all space (with their fragrance).</p>  
<p>55. More excellent than the scent of sandal and incense, of lily and jasmine, is the fragrance of good deeds.</p>  
<p>56. A slight thing is this scent of incense and of sandal-wood, but the scent of the holy pervades the highest heaven.</p>  
<p>57. Death finds not the path of the righteous and strenuous, who are set free by their perfect wisdom.</p>  
<p>58, 59. As on some roadside dung-heap, a flower blooms fragrant and delightful, so amongst the refuse of blinded mortals shines forth in wisdom the follower of the true Buddha.</p>
