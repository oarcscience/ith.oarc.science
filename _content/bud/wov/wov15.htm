<p>146. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Where</span> is the joy, what the pleasure, whilst all is in flames? Benighted, would ye not seek a torch?</p>  
<p>147. Look at this painted image, wounded and swollen, sickly and full of lust, in which there is no permanence;</p>  
<p>148. This wasted form is a nest of disease and very frail: it is full of putrid matter and perishes. Death is the end of life.</p>  
<p>149. What delight is there for him who sees these grey bones scattered like gourds in autumn?</p>  
<p>150. Here is a citadel of bones plastered with flesh and blood, and manned by old age and death, self-will and enmity.</p>  
<p>151. As even the king's bright chariot grows old, so the body of man also comes to old age. But the law of the holy never ages: the holy teach it to the holy.</p>  
<p>152. The simpleton ages like the ox: his weight increases, but not his wisdom.</p>  
<p>153. Many births have I traversed seeking</p>  
<p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></A></p>  
<p>the builder; in vain! Weary is the round of births.</p>  
<p>154. Now art thou seen, O Builder. Nevermore shalt thou build the house! All thy beams are broken; cast down is thy cornerstone. My mind is set upon Nirv&#257;na; it has attained the extinction of desire.</p>  
<p>155. They who have not lived purely nor stored up riches in their youth, these ruefully ponder, as old herons by a lake without fish.</p>  
<p>156. They who have not lived purely nor stored up riches in their youth, are as arrows that are shot in vain: they mourn for the past.</p>
