<p>60. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Long</span> is the night to the watcher, long is the league to the weary traveller: long is the chain of existence to fools who ignore the true Law.</p>  
<p>61. If on a journey thou canst not find thy peer or one better than thyself, make the journey stoutly alone: there is no company with a fool.</p>  
<p>62. "I have sons and wealth," thinks the fool with anxious care; he is not even master of himself, much less of sons and wealth.</p>  
<p>63. The fool who knows his folly is so far wise: but the fool who reckons himself wise is called a fool indeed.</p>  
<p>64. Though for a lifetime the fool keeps company with the wise, yet does he not learn righteousness, as spoon gets no taste of soup.</p>  
<p>65. If but for a moment the thoughtful keep company with the wise, straightway he learns righteousness, as tongue tastes soup.</p>  
<p>66. Fools and dolts go their way, their own</p>

<p>worst enemies; working evil which bears bitter fruit.</p>  
<p>67. That is no good deed which brings remorse, whose reward one receives with tears and lamentation.</p>  
<p>68. But that is the good deed which brings no remorse, whose reward the doer takes with joy and gladness.</p>  
<p>69. Honey sweet to the fool is his sin&#8212;until it ripens: then he comes to grief.</p>  
<p>70. If once a month the fool sips his food from a blade of the sacred grass&#8212;his is no fraction of the Arahat's worth.</p>  
<p>71. Evil does not straightway curdle like milk, but is rather like a smouldering fire which attends the fool and burns him.</p>  
<p>72. When the fool's wisdom bears evil fruit it bursts asunder his happiness, and smashes his head.</p>  
<p>73, 74. If one desire the praise of knaves, or leadership amongst the Bhikkhus, and lordship in the convents, and the reverence of the laity, thinking "Let layman and religious alike appreciate my deeds; let them do my bidding and obey my prohibitions," if such be his fond imaginings, then will ambition and self-will wax great.</p>  
<p>75. One is the road leading to gain, another is that leading to Nirv&#257;na: knowing this, let the Bhikkhu, the follower of Buddha, strive in solitude, not seeking the praise of men.</p>
