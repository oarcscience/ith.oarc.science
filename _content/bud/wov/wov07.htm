<p>33. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">This</span> trembling, wavering mind, so difficult to guard and to control&#8212;this the wise man makes straight as the fletcher straightens his shaft.</p>  
<p>34. As quivers the fish when thrown upon the ground, far from his home in the waters, so the mind quivers as it leaves the realm of Death.</p>  
<p>35. Good it is to tame the mind, so difficult to control, fickle, and capricious. Blessed is the tamed mind.</p>  
<p>36. Let the wise man guard his mind, incomprehensible, subtle, and capricious though it is. Blessed is the guarded mind.</p>  
<p>37. They will escape the fetters of Death who control that far-wandering, solitary, incorporeal cave-dweller, the mind.</p>  
<p>38. In him who is unstable and ignorant of the law and capricious in his faith, wisdom is not perfected.</p>  
<p>39. There is no fear in him, the vigilant one</p>  
<p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></A></p>  
<p>whose mind is not befouled with lust, nor embittered with rage, who cares nought for merit or demerit.</p>  
<p>40. Let him who knows that his body is brittle as a potsherd, make his mind strong as a fortress; let him smite Mara with the sword of wisdom, and let him guard his conquest without dalliance.</p>  
<p>41. Soon will this body lie upon the ground, deserted, and bereft of sense, like a log cast aside.</p>  
<p>42. Badly does an enemy treat his enemy, a foeman his foe: worse is the havoc wrought by a misdirected mind.</p>  
<p>43. Not mother and father, not kith and kin can so benefit a man as a mind attentive to the rights.</p>
