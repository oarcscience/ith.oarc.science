<p>306. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> liar goes to hell, and the villain who denies his crime; these mean ones are alike in the world beyond.</p>  
<p>307. Though clad in yellow robe, the man of many sins who is uncontrolled is born in hell: the sinner is punished by his sin.</p>  
<p>308. Better to swallow a ball of red-hot iron than to live uncontrolled upon the bounty of the faithful.</p>  
<p>309. Four evil consequences follow the sluggard and the adulterer: retribution, broken slumber, an evil name, and in the end hell.</p>  
<p>310. That way lie retribution and an evil character, the short-lived joy of trembling sinners, and a heavy penalty from the ruler. Therefore run not after thy neighbour's wife.</p>  
<p>311. As pampas-grass clumsily handled cuts the hand, so is the community life: abused, it brings a man to hell.</p>  
<p>312. All duties carelessly performed; all vows</p>  
<p><a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="green">p. 69</font></A></p>  
<p>slightingly observed; the recluse life that is open to suspicion&#8212;these bear no great fruit.</p>  
<p>313. If a duty is to be done, do it with thy might: a careless recluse scatters contagion broadcast.</p>  
<p>314. Better leave undone a bad deed; one day the doer will lament: good it is to do the good deed which brings no remorse.</p>  
<p>315. As a fortress guarded within and without, so guard thyself. Leave no loophole for attack! They who fail at their post mourn here, and hereafter go to hell.</p>  
<p>316. Some are ashamed at what is not shameful, and blush not at deeds of shame: these perverse ones go to hell.</p>  
<p>317. They who see fear where there is no fear, and tremble not at fearful things: these perverse ones go to hell.</p>  
<p>318. They who think evil where there is no evil, and make light of grievous sin: these perverse ones go to hell.</p>  
<p>319. But whoso calls sin&nbsp;sin, and innocence&nbsp;innocence: these right-minded ones go to happiness.</p>
