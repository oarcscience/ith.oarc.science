<p>Let the supreme path increasingly expand!"</p>  
<p>This book is called "The Six Yogas of Naropa, with the Successive Instructions Leading to the Profound Path&#8212;the Book with Three Confidences" [i.e. The Book of Threefold Faith&#8212;see Note <A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:1">1</A> <i>Ed</i>.].</p>  
<p>Because of repeated requests from the Lord Canopy of Fame (Mi-Dong-grogs-b&#8217;a-rgyal-mds&#8217;an) and the Reverend Canopy of Merit (Chos-rje-bsod-nams-rgyal-mds&#8217;an) I wrote this book. It includes the well arranged instructions on the practice of Heat Yoga, etc., and some explanations on the common teachings, together with the elaborate expositions on each of the special practices (of the Tantric Yogas). This book was written with a pure wish of spreading the Dharma of this school [Gelugpa], low School), which is thriving in this region to a great extent; however, it has not yet reached the full-flourishing state. In consideration of the welfare of many of those who have faith in and admiration for the teaching of this school, this book was written at the Victorious Place Dge-ldan on the Great Hill of the Pasture Land by me, the well-learned Buddhist monk, the renouncer, Good Mind Fame Tsong Khapa of the East [of Eastern Tibet].</p>  
<p>May goodness and prosperity thrive!</p>
