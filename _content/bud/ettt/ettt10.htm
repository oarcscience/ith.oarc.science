<p>It is the intention of the author to relate the secret, yet famous teachings of the profound Six Yogas of Naropa in two steps. First, the preparatory practice. Second, the main practice of the teaching itself.</p>  
<p>The first step includes two groups of teachings, the ordinary preparatory works of Mahayana Buddhism, and the extraordinary preparations for the Supreme Vehicle<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:3">3</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:3"></A>. About the first group two questions must be answered: (1) Why is it necessary to make an effort in the ordinary practice of Mahayana Buddhism? (2) How should one actually practice them? Let us discuss the first point. It is absolutely necessary to work step by step on the preparations both for the Paramita Vehicle<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:4">4</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:4"></A> and the True Word Vehicle<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:5">5</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:5"></A>. As admonished by Lama Rngog-pa<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:6">6</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:6"></A>, the one who held the traditional way of preaching of Marpa (he quoted from the Tantra of Two Forms<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:7">7</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:7"></A>):</p>  
<p>The disciple must first give and offer &#8230; till&#8230;</p>  
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>  
<p>After that, he is to be given</p>  
<p>The teaching of the Middle Way<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:8">8</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:8"></A>.</p>  
<p>Both schools (exoteric and esoteric) of Mahayana Buddhism exhort the disciples to observe the basic practices and teachings of Buddha, there is no exception, even in Tantra. The Jetsun Milarepa also said that if one wants to know how to liberate oneself in Bardo, one should first practice the prayer of Taking the Three Refuges, then bring forth the Bodhi Heart of Vow and the Bodhi Heart</p>  
<p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="green">p. 127</font></A></p>  
<p>of Performance (see note <A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:15">15</A>). Even then it should be known the misfortune-bringer always turns out to be one's close friend. The fallers in the abyss are the men who follow the cattle.</p>  
<p>Thus, if anyone does not observe the precepts strictly after having taken the oath of Tantra, both he and his guru will fall into danger. It is also said that by merely hearing the advantages of the esoteric teachings one may apply (the initiations) in an easy-going manner which is very dangerous and often leads to disasters. The Jetsun Mila was blessed by the Goddess<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:9">9</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:9"></A> for having preached the Bardo preparation in such a manner. Thus we know that the fundamental teachings of Buddha are essential and necessary to all schools. His holiness Gampopa also urged in his Commentary on the Four Dharmas that all Buddhists should follow the Three Gradual Paths of Lam-rim<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:10">10</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:10"></A> in the beginning stage of his way to Buddhahood.</p>  
<p>Some disciples may raise the question: Why did not Jet-sun Pag-mo-grubpa and other great masters mention any of these preparations in their books on the Six Yogas? This is simply because the preparatory teachings had already been given, and the teachings of the Six Yogas were to be given to those who had already completed the preparatory practice. In their admonishments to the monastic orders, the masters clearly emphasized the importance of the preparatory practices. If one follows these instructions one will be freed from partiality. This is the vital point of both esoteric and exoteric Buddhism; the reader should especially note it.</p>  
<p>Now the second question. How should one actually practice the preparatory teaching? According to the Great Jetsun (Adisha)<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:11">11</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:11"></A>, the disciple should first find a qualified</p>  
<p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></A></p>  
<p>guru of Mahayana Buddhism, think of his teachings and practice them under his instructions wholeheartedly.</p>  
<p>After this, he should then follow the guru's instruction to contemplate the difficulties of attaining this present precious and meaningful human birth. Thus he fervently determines to make right use of this human body; he also learns that to make the most of it is to enter the path of Mahayana in which the first step is to awaken the Heart-for-Bodhi. If the Heart-for-Bodhi is actually awakened in one's heart, he is then able to practice Mahayana Buddhism truly and naturally, otherwise his Malayana will merely be a word. Therefore, the wise Buddhist must strive step by step to put an end to the wrong thoughts adverse to the Heart-for-Bodhi<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:12">12</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:12"></A>.</p>  
<p>If he does not completely give up thoughts concerned with the wordly affairs of this life, he will encounter many difficulties in the practice of both Hinayana and Mahayana. Always he should remind himself that this life is short. Always he should think of his inevitable death and warn himself of the possibility of falling into a lower birth after his departure from this world. Furthermore, he should realize that to strive for a happier birth in his next life is still of no avail, for everything in Sa&#7747;sara is transient and untenable. Rather he should exert himself to attain Liberation, he should <A HREF="errata.htm#17">continuously</A> make an effort to widen his compassion and kindness as these qualities are the roots of the Heart-for-Bodhi. He should try to reach a state in which the compassionate Bodhi-Heart arises spontaneously without effort.</p>  
<p>With a desire for learning the way of the Bodhisattva's actions, he should gladly undertake the Bodhisattvas&#8217; responsibilities and compassionate deeds. With this in</p>  
<p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></A></p>  
<p>mind, he is to observe the precepts of the Bodhisattva and study and practice the Six Paramitas in general. He should particularly pay attention to the preparatory works for Dhayana<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:13">13</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:13"></A>, namely, the fitness and readiness of his mind for meditation. He should also study and practice the teachings of the Prajana Paramita, contemplating on the magic-like and space-like<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:14">14</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:14"></A> nature of all beings. Thereafter, if he is capable of taking the Tantric precepts on himself, he should study the <i>Guru's Fifty Stanza</i> and follow its instructions to serve his guru. In this manner, he should set about the practices of Tantra.</p>  
<p>If he has not undergone these preparatory works step by step, he can never conquer the craving of this life. Thus he has no chance to become a steady and unwavering devotee. By no means then shall he possess unfeigned faith, or an absolute devotion in his heart. He is uncertain about the law of Karma, and he will become an unscrupulous Buddhist who observes no precepts whatsoever. He will have no abomination for Sa&#7747;sara. There will be no tranquility in his mind; therefore, his striving for liberation is merely a talking with no meaning at all. Since kindness and compassion cannot grow within him, he has no chance of developing the spontaneous Wish-for-Heart-of-Bodhi<A HREF="ettt22.htm#an_n_nar:15">15</A><A NAME="an_r_nar:15"></A>. At most he is a nominal Mahayana Buddhist. He lacks a strong desire to learn the actions of a Bodhisattva so that the peacefulness of abiding-in-goodness will never come to him. A steadfast understanding of Meditation and Wisdom will never come to him; he will always be confused at the delicate discriminations on Samadhis. Nor is there a chance for him to attain, an unwavering understanding of the non-Ego truth. If one wants to avoid the aforementioned dangers, he should work hard on the preparatory</p>  
<p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></A></p>  
<p>practices for Mahayana. This is clearly advocated and elucidated by His Holiness Adisha, who received the teaching from the Maitreya-Asanga lineage and also the teachings from the Manju&#347;ri Nagra-juna-Ziwala lineage, and put them together as if to combine the three rivers into one to show that preparatory works are necessary both to the Paramita Path and to the Diamond Path.</p>
