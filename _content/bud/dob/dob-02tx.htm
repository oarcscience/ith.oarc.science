<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="text p. 47">[47]</A> I. Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once dwelling at R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha in the Mango Grove of <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka the children's physician{2}, with a great company of the brethren, with twelve hundred and fifty of the brethren. Now at that time the king of Magadha, A<I>g</I>&acirc;tasattu, the son of the Videha princess{3}, on the Uposatha day, held on the fifteenth, on Komudi (white</P>

<P><SMALL>{1. Gogerly's translation of the first part of this Sutta, and Burnouf's translation of the whole of it, have been reprinted in Grimblot's 'Sept Suttas Palis.' These versions, of remarkable merit for the time when they were made, are full of mistakes which the since-published editions of the Commentary, and of numerous allied texts, enable us now to avoid. I have not thought it necessary to point out the numerous passages, occurring indeed in nearly every sentence, in which the present translation differs from theirs. It should be mentioned here, however, that Burnouf has missed the whole point of the dialogue by misunderstanding the constantly repeated phrase sandi<I>tth</I>ikam s&acirc;ma<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>a-phala<I>m</I> from which this title is taken. He renders it throughout as meaning 'foreseen and general fruit' which is grammatically impossible as regards sandi<I>tth</I>ikam, and rests on a false derivation as regards s&acirc;ma<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>a. This last word means, of course, 'sama<I>n</I>aship, being a sama<I>n</I>a, living as a sama<I>n</I>a, a recluse, a religieux.'</P>

<P>2. <I>G</I>&icirc;vakassa kom&acirc;rabha<I>kk</I>assa. Buddhaghosa (Sum. I, 133) naturally follows the compilers of the Khandakas (V. I, 269) in interpreting the adjective as 'brought up by the Prince.' But see the note at 'Vinaya Texts,' II, 174; which shows that the more likely meaning is 'the bringer-up of children' (child-doctor). Several cures, however, wrought by him are recorded; and the patients are always adults. There is no other reference at all to his being a child-doctor, and the Khandaka which gives the other interpretation is a very ancient document.</P>

<P>3. See the note in my 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 1. Buddhaghosa (p. 139) says she was the daughter of the king of Kosala.}</SMALL></P>

<P>water-lily), the full moon day of the fourth month{1}, at night, when the moon was full, was seated on the upper terrace roof of his palace surrounded by his ministers. And the king, on that sacred day, gave utterance to a hymn of joy, saying:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'How pleasant, friends, is the moonlight night!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How beautiful, friends, is the moonlight night!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How lovely, friends, is the moonlight night!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How soothing, friends, is the moonlight night!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How grand a sign, friends, is the moonlight night!</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Who is the recluse or Brahman whom we may call upon to-night, who, when we call upon him, shall be able to satisfy our hearts{2}?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. When he had thus spoken, a certain minister said to the king: 'There is, Sire, P&ucirc;ra<I>n</I>a Kassapa, the head of an order, of a following, the teacher of a school, well known and of repute as a sophist, revered by the people, a man of experience, who has long been a recluse, old and well stricken in years. Let your Majesty pay a visit to him. It may well be{3} that, on calling upon him, your heart, Sire, shall find peace.' But when he had thus spoken A<I>g</I>&acirc;tasattu the king kept silence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3-7. Then other five ministers spake in the same terms of Makkhali of the cow-pen, <A NAME="text p. 48">[48]</A> of A<I>g</I>ita of the garment of hair, of Pakudha Ka<I>kk</I>&acirc;yana, of Sa<I>&ntilde;g</I>aya of the Bela<I>tt</I>ha clan, and of the Niga<I>nth</I>a of the N&acirc;ta clan. And still, to each, A<I>g</I>&acirc;tasattu the king kept silence.</P>

<P><SMALL>{1. This is interesting, as it shows that the year, for the compilers of our Sutta, began in S&acirc;vana (middle of July to middle of August), that is, with the rainy season. There were three Uposatha days in each month, on the 7th, 14th, and 15th day of the month. The full moon night of Kattika (middle of October to middle of Novemher) is called Komudi (from Kumuda, a white water-lily), because that flower is supposed to bloom then. Burnouf is wrong in translating Komudi as the name of the month.</P>

<P>2. The same lines recur, but in a different order, at <I>G</I>&acirc;t. I, 105. Dosin&acirc;, the etymology of which puzzled Childers and also Buddhaghosa (p. 141), is <I>g</I>yotsn&acirc;.</P>

<P>3. Appeva n&acirc;ma. Both Gogerly and Burnouf take this to mean 'to a certainty,' but compare D. I, 179, 205; V. II, 85, 262.}</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <A NAME="text p. 49">[49]</A> Now at that time <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka the physician was seated, in silence, not far from A<I>g</I>&acirc;tasattu the king. And the king said to him: 'But you, friend <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka, why do you say nothing?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Blessed One, Sire, the Arahat, the all-awakened-one, is now lodging in our Mango Grove, with a great company of the brethren, with twelve hundred and fifty brethren. And this is the good report that has been noised abroad as to Gotama the Blessed One: "An Arahat, fully awakened, is the exalted One, abounding In wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, the teacher of gods and men, a blessed Buddha." Let your Majesty pay a visit to him. It may well be that, on calling upon him, your heart, Sire, shall find peace.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Then, friend <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka, have the riding-elephants made ready.'--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. 'Very good, Sire!' said <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka the physician in assent to the words of the king. And he had five hundred she-elephants made ready, and the state elephant the king was wont to ride, and had word brought to the king: 'The elephants, Sire, are caparisoned. Do now what seemeth to you meet.' Then the king had five hundred of his women mounted on the she-elephants, one on each; and himself mounted the state elephant; and he went forth, the attendants bearing torches, in royal pomp, from R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha to <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka the physician's Mango Grove.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. And the king, when close upon the Mango Grove, was seized with a sudden fear and consternation, and the hairs on his body stood erect. And anxious and excited, he said to <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka: <A NAME="text p. 50">[50]</A> 'You are playing me no tricks, <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka? You are not deceiving me? You are not betraying me to my foes? How can it be that there should be no sound at all, not a sneeze nor a cough, in so large an assembly of the brethren, among twelve hundred and fifty of the brethren?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fear not, O king. I play no trick, neither deceive you; nor would I betray you to the foe. Go on, O king,</P>

<!------------------------p. 68------------------------>

<P><A NAME="p. 68">{p. 68}</A></P>

<P>go straight on! There, in the pavilion hall, the lamps are burning.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Then the king went on, on his elephant as far as the path was passable for elephants, and then on foot, to the door of the pavilion; and then said to <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But where, <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka, is the Blessed One?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That is he, O king, sitting against the middle pillar, and facing the East, with the brethren around him.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Then the king went up, and stood respectfully on one side. And as he stood there and looked on the assembly, seated in perfect silence, calm as a clear lake, he broke out: 'Would that my son, Ud&acirc;yi Bhadda, might have such calm as this assembly of the brethren now has!'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Do your thoughts then go where love guides them?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I love the boy, and wish that he, Ud&acirc;yi Bhadda, might enjoy such calm as this assembly has.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Then the king bowed to the Blessed One, and stretching forth his joined palms in salutation to the Order took his seat aside, <A NAME="text p. 51">[51]</A> and said to the Blessed One: 'I would fain question the Blessed One on a certain matter, if he give me opportunity to set forth the question.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Ask, O king, whatsoever you desire.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. 'There are, Sir, a number of ordinary crafts:--mahouts, horsemen, charioteers, archers, standard bearers, camp marshalls, camp followers, high military officers of royal birth, military scouts{1}, men brave as elephants, champions, heroes, warriors in buckskin, home-born slaves, cooks, barbers, bath attendants, confectioners, garland-makers, washermen, weavers, basket-makers, potters, arithmeticians, accountants, and whatsoever others of like kind there may be. All</P>

<P><SMALL>{1. Pakkhandino, 'rushers forth.' The exact meaning of some of these military terms is still uncertain, and was apparently uncertain to Buddhaghosa. They all recur, with some differences of reading. in the Milinda (p. 331, in a later and much longer list), and also in the Anguttara (IV, 107), as the names of the constituent elements of a standing army.}</SMALL></P>

<P>these enjoy, in this very world, the visible fruits of their craft. They maintain themselves, and their parents and children and friends, in happiness and comfort. They keep up gifts, the object of which is gain on high, to recluses and Brahmans,--gifts that lead to rebirth in heaven, that redound to happiness, and have bliss as their result. Can you, Sir, declare to me any such immediate fruit, visible in this very world, of the life of a recluse{1}?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. 'Do you admit to us, O king, that you have put the same question to other recluses or to Brahmans?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I do, Lord.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Then tell us how they answered it, if you do not mind.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I have no objection where the Blessed One, or others like him, are.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="text p. 52">[52]</A> 'Then speak, O king.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. "Once I went to P&ucirc;ra<I>n</I>a Kassapa{2}. And after exchanging with him the greetings and compliments of friendship and courtesy, I seated myself beside him, and put to him the same question as I have now put, Lord, to you.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. 'Then P&ucirc;ra<I>n</I>a Kassapa said to me: "To him who acts, O king, or causes another to act, to him who mutilates or causes another to mutilate, to him who punishes or causes another to punish, to him who causes grief or torment, to him who trembles or causes others to tremble, to him who kills a living creature, who takes what is not given, who breaks into houses, who commits dacoity, or robbery, or highway robbery, or adultery, or who speaks lies, to him thus acting there is no guilt. If with a discus with an edge sharp as</P>

<P><SMALL>{1. Burnouf has made a sad mess of this important and constantly repeated clause. He has 'Is it then possible, Sir, that one should declare to them (that is, to the craftsmen just mentioned) in this world, such a result (of their actions) as foreseen and as the general fruit of their conduct?' But the king asks the Buddha to tell him (the king himself) whether the members of the Order derive from their lire any benefit corresponding to that which the craftsmen derive from theirs.</P>

<P>2. According to Buddhaghosa (p. 142) he was one of the teachers who went about naked.}</SMALL></P>

<P>a razor he should make all the living creatures on the earth one heap, one mass, of flesh, there would be no guilt thence resulting, no increase of guilt would ensue. Were he to go along the south bank of the Ganges striking and slaying, mutilating and having men mutilated, oppressing and having men oppressed, there would be no guilt thence resulting, no increase of guilt would ensue. Were he to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving alms, and ordering gifts to be given, offering sacrifices or causing them to be offered, there would be no merit thence resulting, no increase of merit. <A NAME="text p. 53">[53]</A> In generosity, in self-mastery, in control of the senses, in speaking truth there is neither merit, nor increase of merit." Thus, Lord, did P&ucirc;ra<I>n</I>a Kassapa, when asked what was the immediate advantage in the life of a recluse, expound his theory of non-action{1}. Just, Lord, as if a man, when asked what a mango was, should explain what a bread fruit is, just so did P&ucirc;ra<I>n</I>a Kassapa, when asked what was the fruit, in this present state of being, of the life of a recluse, expound his theory of non-action. Then, Lord, it occurred to me: "How should such a one as I think of giving dissatisfaction to any recluse or Brahman in my realm?" So I neither applauded nor blamed what he said, and though dissatisfied I gave utterance to no expression of dissatisfaction, and neither accepting nor rejecting that answer of his, I arose from my seat, and departed thence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. ['In the same manner I went to five other teachers, and receiving to this same question put an answer not to the point, I behaved in each case as just set forth. And the answers of the five were thus:]{2}</P>

<P><SMALL>{1. Akiriya<I>m</I> vy&acirc;k&acirc;si. Gogerly interprets this 'he replied by affirming that there are no future rewards and punishments.' Burnouf has simply 'm'a donn&eacute; une r&eacute;ponse vaine.' But the corresponding word in the subsequent sections summarises the theory of the teacher questioned. On this theory compare A. I, 62; V. I, 235.</P>

<P>2. In the text the framework of the interview is repeated each time in the same words as above. Only the answers differ. The answers all recur in the Ma<I>ggh</I>ima I, 513 foll.}</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. 'When one day I had thus asked Makkhali of the cow-pen{1}, he said: "There is, O king, no cause, either ultimate or remote, for the depravity of beings; they become depraved without reason and without cause. There is no cause, either proximate or remote, for the rectitude of beings; they become pure without reason and without cause. The attainment of any given condition, of any character, does not depend either on one's own acts, or on the acts of another, or on human effort. There is no such thing as power or energy, or human strength or human vigour. All animals, all creatures (with one, two, or more senses), all beings (produced from eggs or in a womb), all souls (in plants){2} are without force and power and energy of their own. They are bent this way and that by their fate, by the necessary conditions of the class to which they belong, by their individual nature: and it is according to their position in one or other of the six classes that they experience ease or pain.</P>

<P><SMALL>{1. 'There is a good deal in both the Buddhist and the <I>G</I>ain texts about this Makkhali Gos&acirc;la, whose followers were called &Acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;vakas, and who was regarded, from the Buddhist point of view, as the worst of the sophists. Some of the <I>G</I>aina passages, and also Buddhaghosa here, are referred to by Hoernle, 'Uv&acirc;saka das&acirc;o,' pp. 108 foll.: and in the Appendixes. The principal Pi<I>t</I>aka passages are M. I, 31, 198, 238, 250, 483, 516, 524. S. I, 66, 68; III, 69, 211; IV, 398. A. I, 33, 286; III, 276, 384. V. I, 8, 291; II, 111, 130, 165, 284; IV, 74. See also <I>G</I>&acirc;t. I, 493 and G. V, 68. As the sect is thrice mentioned in the Asoka Edicts as receiving royal gifts it is certain that it retained an important position for several centuries at least. See Senart, 'Inscriptions de Piyadasi,' II, 82, 209.</P>

<P>From the beginning of the answer down to the end of p. 53 recurs at S. III, 211, and the rest of it at ibid. 212, and the first part of the answer is ascribed at ibid. p. 69 to P&ucirc;ra<I>n</I>a Kassapa.</P>

<P>2. Sabbe satt&acirc;, sabbe p&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;, sabbe bh&ucirc;t&acirc;, sabbe <I>g</I>&icirc;v&acirc;. Buddhaghosa gives details of these four classes of living beings, showing how they are meant to include all that has life, on this earth, from men down to plants. The explanation is very confused, and makes the terms by no means mutually exclusive. They are frequently used in the same order in the <I>G</I>aina-S&ucirc;tras, and Professor Jacobi renders them accordingly 'Every sentient being, every insect, every living thing, whether animal or vegetable.' '<I>G</I>aina-Sutras,' II, xxv. This is much better; but we have, in our version, to give the sense in whjch the Buddhists supposed Gos&acirc;la to have taken the words.}</SMALL></P>

Though the wise should hope: 'By this virtue or this performance of duty, or this penance, or this righteousness will I make the Karma (I have inherited), that is not yet mature, mature'--though the fool should hope, by the same means, to get gradually rid of Karma that has matured--neither of them can do it.

'When, one day, I had thus asked A<I>g</I>ita of the garment of hair, he said{1}: "There is no such thing, O king, as alms or sacrifice or offering. There is neither fruit nor result of good or evil deeds. There is no such thing as this world or the next. There is neither father nor mother, nor beings springing into life without them. There are in the world no recluses or Brahmans who have reached the highest point{2}, who walk perfectly, and who having understood and realised, by themselves alone, both this world and the next, make their wisdom known to others.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"A human being is built up of the four elements. When he dies the earthy in him returns and relapses to the earth, the fluid to the water, the heat to the fire, the windy to the air, and his faculties{3} pass into space.

<P>2. Sammag-gato. Buddhaghosa gives here no explanation of this word, but the <I>G</I>&acirc;taka Commentary on <I>G</I>&acirc;t. III, 305 says it means the man who has attained the highest fruit; that is, Arahatship. Gato is used here in the same sense as it has in Tath&acirc;gato, in gatatto (in the Niga<I>nth</I>a paragraph below), and in vi<I>gg</I>&acirc;-gato (S. N. 730, 733, 743), that is, who has not only attempted to go to, but has actually reached, the aim (common alike to the orthodox Ved&acirc;ntist Brahmans and to each of the various schools of independent, dissenting, thinkers and recluses) of the conquest over ignorance, of the grasp of truth.</P>

They move not, neither do they vary, they trench not one upon another, nor avail aught as to ease or pain or both. And what are the seven? The four elements--earth, water, fire, and air-and ease, and pain, and the soul as a seventh. So there is neither slayer nor causer of slaying, hearer or speaker, knower or explainer.

He keeps watch upon his faculty of sight, and he attains to mastery over it. And so, in like manner, when he hears a sound with his ear, or smells an odour with his nose, or tastes a flavour with his tongue, or feels a touch with his body, or when he cognises a phenomenon with his mind he is not entranced in the general appearance or the details of it. He sets himself to restrain that which might give occasion for evil states, covetousness and dejection, to flow in over him so long as he dwells unrestrained as to his mental (representative) faculty.

And when the object is a person of the other sex this phrase is the idiom used for our 'falling in love with.' Buddhaghosa gives, as an instance of the nimitta, the general conclusion that the object seen, heard, &amp;c., is a man or woman; of the anuvya<I>&ntilde;g</I>ana, the perception of the detail that he or she is smiling, talking. &amp;c.</P>

<P><SMALL>{1. This is a favourite description of the body. (See M. I, 500; II, 17; S. IV, 83; <I>G</I>&acirc;t. I, 146, &amp;c.) The words for erasion, abrasion, are cunningly chosen (u<I>kkh</I>&acirc;dana, parimaddana). They are also familiar technical terms of the Indian shampooer, and are so used above (<A HREF="dob-01tx.htm#p. 13">p. 7</A>, &sect; 16 of the text). The double meaning must have been clearly present to the Indian hearer, and the words are, therefore. really untranslatable.</P>

<P>2. Vi<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>a. 'The five senses, sensations arising from objects, and all emotions and intellectual processes,' says Buddhaghosa (p. 221).</P>

<P>3. In spite of this and similar passages the adherents of the soul theory (having nothing else to fasten on) were apt to fasten on to the Buddhist Vi<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>a as a possible point of reconciliation with their own theory. Even an admirer of the Buddha (one S&acirc;ti, a member of the Order) went so far as to tell the Buddha himself that he must, as he admitted transmigration, have meant that the Vi<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>a did not really depend upon, was not really bound up with, the body, but that it formed the link in transmigration. In perhaps the most earnest and emphatic of all the Dialogues (M. I, 256 foll.), the Buddha meets and refutes at length this erroneous representation of his view. But it still survives. I know two living writers on Buddhism who (in blissful ignorance of the Dialogue in question) still fasten upon Buddha the opinion he so expressly refused to accept.}</SMALL></P>

It is from the sheath that the reed has been drawn forth{2}." And similarly were he to take a snake out of its slough, or draw a sword from its scabbard{3}.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This, O king, is an immediate fruit of the life of a recluse, visible in this life, and higher and sweeter than the last.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87. 'With his heart thus serene, made pure, translucent, cultured, devoid of evil, supple, ready to act, firm and imperturbable, he applies and bends down his mind to the modes of the Wondrous Gift{4}. <A NAME="text p. 78">[78]</A> He enjoys the Wondrous Gift in its various modes--being one he becomes many, or having become many becomes one again; he becomes visible or invisible; he goes, feeling no obstruction, to the further side of a wall or rampart or hill, as if through air; he penetrates up and down through solid ground, as if through water; he walks on water without breaking</P>

<P><SMALL>{1. Buddhaghosa explains that, if the Bhikshu have his ears unpierced, so will the image, and so on.</P>

<P>2. This old simile occurs already in the <I>S</I>atapatha-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a IV, 3, 3, 16.</P>

<P>3. The point is the similarity. Buddhaghosa explains that the Kara<I>nd</I>a is not a basket (as Burnouf renders it), but the skin which the snake sloughs off; and that the scabbard is like the sword, whatever the sword's shape. He adds that of course a man could not take a snake out of its slough with his hand. He is supposed in the simile to do so in imagination.</P>

<P>4. Iddhi, literally 'well-being, prosperity.' The four Iddhis of a king are personal beauty, length of life, strong health, and popularity (M. Sud. Sutta in my 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 259-261). The Iddhis of Gotama when at home, as a boy, were the possession of a beautiful garden, soft clothing, comfortable lodging, pleasant music, and good food (A. I, 145). Worldly Iddhi is distinguished from spiritual at A. I, 93. Buddhaghosa gives nine sorts of Iddhi, mostly intellectual, at Asl. 91, and compare 237. There are no examples in the Pi<I>t</I>akas of concrete instances of any of these except the last; but see S. IV, 289, 290; A. III, 340, 341; M. P. S. 43.}</SMALL></P>

<P><SMALL>{1. This paragraph forms the subject of the discussion in the Kath&acirc; Vatthu III, 9 (p. 250). The mere knowledge of the general fact of the action of Karma is there distinguished from the Dibba-<I>k</I>akkhu, the Heavenly Eye; and the instance of S&acirc;riputta is quoted, who had that knowledge, but not the Heavenly Eye. As he was an Arahat it follows that the possession of the Heavenly Eye was not a necessary consequence of Arahatship. Buddhaghosa adds (p. 224) that the sphere of vision of the Heavenly Eye did not extend to the Formless Worlds. On the Dhamma-<I>k</I>akkhu, 'the Eye for the Truth,' see below, <A HREF="dob-03tx.htm#text p. 110">p. 110</A>, &sect; 21 of the text.</P>

<P>3. &Acirc;savas, Deadly Floods, another untranslatable term. Neumann has Illusion (Wahn); Burnouf has defilement (souillures). They are sometimes the three here mentioned (M. I, 23, 155; A. I, 167; S. IV, 256, &amp;c.); but speculation, theorising (Di<I>tth</I>i) is added as a fourlh in the M. P. S. and elsewhere. Unfortunately, the word has not been yet found in its concrete, primary, sense; unless indeed Buddhaghosa's statement (at Asl. 48) that well-seasoned spirituous liquors were called &acirc;sav&acirc; be taken literally. It is therefore impossible to be sure what is the simile that underlies the use of the word in its secondary, ethical sense. Perhaps after all it is the idea of overwhelming intoxication, and not of flood or taint or ooze, that we ought to consider.</P>
