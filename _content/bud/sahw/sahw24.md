The various *meinichi* (commemorations) of Shotoku Taishi, of the seven
Patriarchs, and of the patron zenchishiki of the Central Temple of each
one of the various subsects.

The *meinichi* of other *zenchishiki*. In this respect the Calendar is
continually changing, for as the years go by, and new *zenchishiki* are
added to the roll of the Saints, some of the old ones are dropped out,
or their festivals amalgamated with those of others. In this way
thanksgivings are continually being offered for the lives of recent
saints, while care is taken that the roll of saints actually mentioned
by name shall not become wearisomely long. Orthodox, Catholic,
Protestant, we may all learn

something from this sensible practice. Nichiren (Seigoroku p. 191)
accuses Hōnen and Zendō of conspiring to drive S’akyamuni out of the
Buddhist Church by turning his festivals in the 4th and 12 months into
festivals of Yakushi and of Namu-Amida Butsu, the glorified and
triumphant Amida. This is still the case: the Birthday of S’akyamuni,
which often falls during our Easter festivities, though, very devoutly
kept by other Jōdo Sects, is not kept officially by the Shinshu. No more
are the Festivals in honour of S’akyamuni's Enlightenment and His
Nirvana. Yakushi, the "master of medicines," who healed sickness, and
had twelve Apostles, is not mentioned in Shinshu Theology. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_115"></span>[148:\*](sahw24.htm#fr_115) While the Eastern
Hongwanji has adopted the new calendar in its table of Fasts and
Festivals, the Western Hongwanji retains the old lunar reckoning. Thus
the commemoration of Shinran Shonin falls in one case in our November,
in the other, in our January. Next year (1911) will be the 650th
anniversary of Shinran, and the 700th of that of Honen's death.
