<p>I must not allow my book to come out without expressing a word of thanks to friends who have helped me; to Mr. Tada, for his translation of the Shoshinge, to Prof. Anezaki, for reading through several of my chapters, to Mr. Tachibana, for his trouble in making the index, and to the Rev. W. F. Madeley, for assistance with his typewriter.</p>  
<p>I do not reckon myself to have reached final conclusions, but I hope I have cleared the way for further study.</p>
