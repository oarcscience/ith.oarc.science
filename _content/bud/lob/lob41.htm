<p>THE Master was happy to number these relatives among his disciples, and he took them with him to the Bamboo Grove. There, poor Nanda was suffering. He kept thinking of Sundarika; she often appeared to him in his dreams, and he regretted having left her. The Buddha knew of his unhappiness, and he decided to cure him.</p>  
<p>One day, he took him by the hand and led him to a tree where a hideous monkey was sitting.</p>  
<p>"Look at that monkey," said he, "is she not beautiful?"</p>  
<p>"I have rarely seen one as ugly," replied Nanda.</p>  
<p>"Really?" said the Master. "And yet she resembles Sundarika, your former betrothed."</p>  
<p>"What are you talking about!" exclaimed Nanda. "Do you mean to say that this monkey looks like Sundarika, who is grace, who is beauty itself?"</p>  
<p>"In what way is Sundarika different? Are they not both females, do they not both awaken the desire of the male? I believe you would be willing to leave the path of holiness and run to Sundarika's</p>  
<p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="green">p. 201</font></A></p>  
<p>arms, just as somewhere in this wood there is a monkey that can be roused to a frenzy of love by the violent ardor of this female. They will both become old and decrepit, and then you, as well as the monkey, will wonder what could have caused your folly. They will both die, and perhaps you and the monkey will then understand the vanity of passion. Sundarika is no different from this monkey."</p>  
<p>But Nanda was not listening. He was sighing. He was dreaming that he saw slender, graceful Sundarika wandering in a garden bright with flowers.</p>  
<p>"Take the hem of my cloak!" the Blessed One said, imperiously.</p>  
<p>Nanda obeyed. He felt the earth suddenly give way under him, and a fierce wind sweep him to the sky. When he regained his feet, he found himself in a marvellous park. He was walking on a path of gold, and the flowers were living jewels, fashioned out of rubies and fragrant sapphires.</p>  
<p>"You are in Indra's sky," said the Blessed One. "Open your sightless eyes."</p>  
<p>Nanda saw a house of shining silver surrounded by an emerald field. An Apsaras, far lovelier than Sundarika, was standing at the door. She was smiling. Maddened by desire, Nanda rushed to her, but she stopped him with a sudden gesture.</p>  
<p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></A></p>  
<p>"Be pure on earth," she said to him; "keep your vows, Nanda. After your death, you will be reborn here; then you may come to my arms."</p>  
<p>The Apsaras disappeared. Nanda and the Master returned to earth.</p>  
<p>Nanda forgot Sundarika. He was haunted by the lovely vision he had seen in the celestial gardens, and, out of love for the Apsaras, he now resolved to lead a pure life.</p>  
<p>But the monks still looked at him with disapproval. They would not speak to him; often, when they met him in the Bamboo Grove, they would smile at him scornfully. This made him unhappy. He thought, "They seem to bear me ill will; I wonder why?" One day, he stopped Ananda who was passing, and he asked him:</p>  
<p>"Why do the monks avoid me? Why do you not speak to me any more, Ananda? Formerly, in Kapilavastu, we were friends as well as relatives. What have I done to offend you?"</p>  
<p>"Poor man!" replied Ananda. "We, who meditate on the saintly truths, have been forbidden by the Master to speak to you, who meditate on the charms of an Apsaras!"</p>  
<p>And he left.</p>  
<p>Nanda was very disturbed. He ran to the Master; he fell at his feet and wept. The Master said to him:</p>  
<p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></A></p>  
<p>"Your thoughts are evil, Nanda. You are a slave to your feelings. First it was Sundarika, now it is an Apsaras, who turns your head. And you would be reborn! Reborn among the Gods? What folly, what vanity! Strive to attain wisdom, Nanda; give heed to my teachings, and kill your devouring passions."</p>  
<p>Nanda pondered the Buddha's words. He became a most obedient disciple, and gradually he purified his mind. Sundarika no longer appeared to him in his dreams, and now, when he thought of the Apsaras, he laughed at having wanted to become a God for her sake. One day, when he saw a hideous monkey watching him from a tree-top, he cried in a triumphant voice:</p>  
<p>"Hail, you that Sundarika can not equal in grace; hail, you that are lovelier far than the loveliest Apsaras!"</p>  
<p>He took great pride in having conquered his passions. "I am a true saint," he said to himself, "and in virtue I will not yield even to my brother."</p>  
<p>He made a robe for himself of the same size as the Master's. Some monks saw him in the distance, and they said:</p>  
<p>"Here comes the Master. Let us rise and greet him."</p>  
<p>But as Nanda drew near, they saw their mistake.</p>  
<p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> They were embarrassed, and as they sat down again, they said:</p>  
<p>"He has not been in the community as long as we have; why should we rise in his presence?"</p>  
<p>Nanda had been pleased to see the monks rise at his approach; he was abashed to see them sit down again. But he was afraid to complain; he felt they would blame him. Yet it was no lesson to him; he continued to walk through the Bamboo Grove, wearing a robe that was like the Buddha's. In the distance, he was taken for the Master, and the monks would rise from their seats; but at his approach, they would laugh and sit down again.</p>  
<p>Finally, a monk went to the Buddha and told him. He was very displeased. He assembled the monks, and in front of them all, he asked Nanda:</p>  
<p>"Nanda, did you really wear a robe of the same size as mine?"</p>  
<p>"Yes, Blessed One," replied Nanda; "I wore a robe of the same size as yours."</p>  
<p>"What!" said the Master, "a disciple dares to make a robe for himself of the same size as the Buddha's! What do you mean by such audacity? An action of this kind does not tend to arouse the faith of the unbeliever, nor does it help to strengthen the faith of the believer. You must shorten your robe, Nanda, and, in the future, any</p>  
<p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="green">p. 205</font></A></p>  
<p>monk who makes a robe for himself of the same size as the Buddha's, or larger than the Buddha's, will be committing a grave offense, an offense for which he will be severely punished."</p>  
<p>Nanda saw the error of his ways, and he realized that to be a true saint, he would have to conquer his pride.</p>
