   THE FOUNDER AND HIS TEACHINGS:
   PART THREE

   The doctrines which were taught by Lord Shenrab and recorded in these three 
   accounts are divided into two systems. One classification is called Gozhi 
   Dzonga (sGo-bzhi mdzod-lnga): "The Four Portals and the Treasury as Fifth".
   These are:

    1)       Chabkar (Chab-dkar): White Waters; it contains the esoteric or    
             higher tantric practices.

    2)       Chabnag (Chab-nag): Black Waters; includes narratives and various 
             rites, magic and ordinary.

    3)       Phanyul ('Phan-yul): The Land of Phan: explains the monastic 
             rules and gives exposition of philosophical concepts.

    4)       Ponse (dPon-yul): The Lordly Guide; it contains the Great 
             Perfection practices (rDzogs-chen).

    5)       Thothog (mTho-thog): The Treasury; it comprises the essential 
             aspects of all the Four Portals.

    The second classification is called Thegpa Rimgu'i Bon (Theg-pa-rim-dgu'i
    Bon), "The Bon of the Nine Successive Stages [or simply] 'The Nine Ways of 
    Bon'". The first four are the cause (rGyud-kyi theg-pa) the next four 
    are the ways of result ('Bras-bu'i theg-pa) and the ninth is the Great 
    Perfection (rDzogs-chen). Examined individually their subject matters 
    are as follows:
    1) The Way of the Shen of Prediction: Mo (prediction), rTsis (astrology)
       gTo (ritual) and dPhyad (examination of causes).
    2) The way of the Shen of the Visual World: nature and origin of entities.
    3) The Way of the Shen of Illusion: For disposing of adverse powers.
    4) The Way of the Shen of Existence: Bardo and guiding one through death.
    5) The Way of the Virtuous Followers: Guides those who follow this path.
    6) The Way of the Monkhood: Rules of monastic discipline.
    7) The Way of Pure Sound: Higher tantric practice, ritual and mandala.
    8) The Way of the Primeval Shen: Matters of practice and behaviour.
    9) The Supreme Way: Attainment of rDzogs-chen, the Great Perfection.
