    BODHISATTVA WARRIORS
    by Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche
     
       Many great Buddhist masters have prophesied that centuries from
    now, when the forces of aggression amass on earth and no reason can
    turn them back, the kingdom of Shambhala will open its gates and its
    enlightened warriors will come forth into battle. Whoever they
    encounter will be given a choice--turn away from non virtue to virtue
    or, by direct, wrathful intervention, be liberated into a pure land
    beyond suffering.
     
       A Buddhist story tells of a ferry captain whose boat was carrying
    500 bodhisattvas in the guise of merchants. A robber on board planned
    to kill everyone and pirate the ship's cargo.
     
       The captain, a bodhisattva himself, saw the man's murderous
    intention and realized this crime would result in eons of torment for
    the murderer. In his compassion, the captain was willing to take
    hellish torment upon himself by killing the man to prevent karmic
    suffering that would be infinity greater than the suffering of the
    murdered victims. The captain's compassion was impartial; his
    motivation was utterly selfless.
     
       Now, as I write this, the Middle East is inflamed with war.
    Watching the television news, I pray that this war will prevent
    greater wars, greater suffering, and that those opposed to war develop
    the skills to bring about authentic peace.  We cannot fully discern
    the motivation of any participants involved in the conflict, but it is
    unlikely that many have the ability to bring about ultimate liberation
    for friends and enemies alike, or that they will be able to sustain
    the bodhisattva's impartial compassion as they engage in conflict.
     
       What we can know is our own minds. We can adhere to Buddhist ideals
    in our activities, whether we are combatants, protestors, decision-
    makers or concerned witnesses. We can pray that whatever virtue there
    is in the situation prevails, that genuine peace be established. The
    Buddha has taught that throughout countless lifetimes all beings have
    been our parents and have shown us great kindness. Now they have
    fallen under the sway of the mind's poisons of desire, anger,
    ignorance, and they suffer terribly. Could we exclude any from our
    compassion any more than the sun could exclude any from the warmth and
    radiance of its rays.
     
       As we aspire to peace, now and in the future cycles of our
    existence, we cannot deny the possibility that each of us may be
    confronted with the need for wrathful intervention in order to prevent
    greater harm.  May the spiritual mining we undertake now allow us to
    enter such situations free from the delusions of the mind's poisons.
    May we act with spontaneous compassion to bring ultimate liberation to
    all alike, both victims and aggressors.
