    Tibetan Contemplative Traditions

    Who is Avalokitesvara?  What is his place in Buddhist doctrine 
    and history?  Why is he important in Tibetan Buddhism?  What is his 
    function in Tibetan Buddhism?  What does he do?  What are the 
    philosophical explanations of his existence?  How is he used in 
    contemplative practice?
         Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, is one of the 
    most important and popular Buddhist dieties.  Although he originally 
    was conceived of in a Mahayana context, he has been worshipped under 
    different names and in different shapes in nearly every form of 
    Buddhism in every country Buddhism has entered.
         Avalokitesvara first appears in Indian Buddhism.  He is 
    originally mentioned as one of a number of bodhisattvas.  These 
    bodhisattvas are personifications of various attributes of the 
    Buddha.  Avalokitesvara is the personification of compassion.  The 
    development of a Buddhist doctrine of bodhisattvas is more or less 
    contemporaneous with the development of brahmanic deity worship.  
    Either the same societal forces led to both developments, or the 
    bodhisattva doctrine was a response to the rival movement of 
    brahmanic deity worship.  The bodhisattva doctrine may have appeared 
    as early as the second century B.C.E.  
         Originally, bodhisattvas were considered to be less important 
    than buddhas.  Buddhas, of course, are completely enlightened 
    beings, whereas bodhisattvas are beings who are on the verge of 
    being completely enlightened.  Bodhisattvas originally appear as 
    attendants of the buddhas.  Texts speak of there being vast numbers 
    of bodhisattvas.  A few of the bodhisattvas are more important than 
    others.  Avalokitesvara does not appear in the earliest texts about 
    bodhisattvas.  However, after a while he becomes one of the 
    important bodhisattvas.  By the second century C.E., in the larger 
    Sukhavativyuha, Avalokitesvara is described along with 
    Mahasthamaprapta as one of the two bodhisattvas in Sukhavati, the 
    pure land of the Buddha Amitayus.  The two of them are described as 
    the source of the light that illumines the pure land.  They also 
    teach the devotees of Amitayus, adapting their techniques to the 
    understanding of the listeners.  
         Avalokitesvara's prominence changed as the doctrinal position 
    of Mahayana Buddhism changed.  In Mahayana, compassion and wisdom 
    are seen as being the two most important qualities a person can 
    develop.  In early Mahayana, wisdom was seen as more important than 
    compassion.  Therefore, Manjusri, the bodhisattva of wisdom, was the 
    most highly regarded bodhisattva.  However, with time, compassion 
    came to be seen as the more important quality, and thus 
    Avalokitesvara became the most honored bodhisattva.  
         Avalokitesvara's rise in prominence did not stop at this 
    point.  Probably around the fifth century C.E., a full-blown cult of 
    Avalokitesvara emerged.  Avalokitesvara evolves into the supreme 
    savior of all suffering beings.  He takes on the characteristics of 
    various brahmanic gods, such as Brahma, Visnu, and Siva.  Like 
    Brahma, Avalokitesvara is described as the creator of the universe.  
    "From his eyes arose the sun and the moon, . . . from his mouth, the 
    wind, . . . from his feet, the earth."1  He is also described as 
    being the creator of the brahmanic dieties.  This attribution of 
    power to Avalokitesvara may well have been aimed at proselytizing 
    among brahmanic followers.  
         Descriptions of his physical form become increasingly 
    fantastic.  He is described as being enormously large.  His face is 
    a hundred thousand yojanas in circumference (a yojana is a few miles 
    long).  His body is gold colored.  He has a halo in which there are 
    five hundred buddhas, each attended by five hundred bodhisattvas, 
    each attended by numberless gods.  From the hair between his 
    eyebrows there flow eighty-four kinds of rays.  Each ray contains a 
    vast number of buddhas and bodhisattvas.  Each of his ten finger 
    tips has eighty-four thousand pictures and each picture has 
    eighty-four thousand rays which shine over everything that exists.  
    And so forth.  
         At this point, Avalokitesvara takes precedence over the 
    buddhas.  Even the buddhas cannot estimate Avalokitesvara's merit.  
    It is said that just thinking of him garners more merit than 
    honoring a thousand buddhas.  Avalokitesvara's rise to prominence 
    may be partially caused by the Mahayana doctrine of the bodhisattva 
    vow.  This doctrine says that the most wonderfully compassionate 
    decision is to vow to stay a bodhisattva instead of becoming a 
    buddha, because bodhisattvas can more effectively help other beings 
    become enlightened.  Because of his compassion, Avalokitesvara has 
    vowed not to become a buddha and slip into nirvana until after all 
    sentient beings are saved from the nearly endless round of suffering 
    in samsara.  Instead, he has committed to continued existence so 
    that he can help suffering beings.  Avalokitesvara is not the only 
    bodhisattva who has made this vow.   However, he embodies the 
    compassionate motivation which led all bodhisattvas to the vow.  
    Thus, valuing the bodhisattva vow leads to valuing Avalokitesvara 
    and everything he signifies.  
         As compassionate action is Avalokitesvara's essence, he is 
    supremely helpful.  He can assume any form in order to help sentient 
    beings, and there are descriptions of him appearing as buddhas, 
    brahmanic gods, humans, and animals.  In all these forms he does 
    wonderful things to help alleviate the suffering of beings and bring 
    them towards enlightenment.  He rescues his followers from fires, 
    from drowning, from bandits, from murder, from prisons.  He gives 
    children to female followers who want children.  He helps release 
    beings from the three mental poisons of passion, hatred, and 
    delusion.  He helpful both on the physical, worldly plain, and on a 
    more psychological or spiritual level.  
         In addition to being the personification of compassion, 
    Avalokitesvara has been connected with light more thoroughly than 
    any other Buddhist deity.  The stories say that he was created from 
    a ray of light which emanated from Amitabha Buddha.  Avalokitesvara 
    is a luminous being of light, and is repeatedly described as 
    radiating light which shines over all sentient beings and over all 
    corners of the universe.  Similarly, he sees everything and everyone 
    in all corners of the universe, a fact that is emphasized by his 
    name.  "Avalokitesvara" comes from two roots, "avalokita" and 
    "isvara".  "Avalokita" means "glance" or "look".  "Isvara" means 
    "lord".  "Avalokitesvara" has been taken to mean such things as 
    "Lord of what we see", "Lord who is seen", "Lord who is everywhere 
    visible", "Lord who sees from on high", and "Lord of compassionate 
    glances".  None of these interpretations are definitive, but 
    regardless of how his name is interpreted, Avalokitesvara is 
    certainly connected with lightness and sight.  His ability to see 
    everywhere is important because it allows him to manifest his 
    compassion everywhere.  The light that he emanates everywhere is 
    sometimes described as a representation of the flow of his 
    compassion to all parts of the universe.  
         As Buddhism spread throughout Asia, the teachings about 
    Avalokitesvara were carried everywhere Buddhism went.  In China and 
    Japan, Avalokitesvara is the most popular bodhisattva.  However, he 
    has undergone a sex-change, and is almost always portrayed in 
    feminine form.  In China, he/she is called Kuan-yin or occasionally 
    Kuan-tzu-tsai.  In Japan, she is called Kan-non or Kwan-non.  In 
    both countries, she is seen as the supreme savior of suffering 
    beings and is worshipped widely as the goddess of mercy and 
    compassion.  She gives children to women who pray to her for 
    offspring.  
         The cult of Avalokitesvara also spread to Sri Lanka.  This is a 
    little surprising as Sri Lanka primarily follows Theravada Buddhism, 
    while Avalokitesvara was originally a strictly Mahayana conception.  
    In Sri Lanka, he is called Natha, which is an abbreviation of 
    Lokesvaranatha, which means "Lord of the World".  He has become 
    identified with the bodhisattva Maitreya, the "future Buddha".  He 
    is also seen as being identical with several Hindu gods.  Natha is 
    seen as the guardian deity of Sri Lanka, and is reportedly 
    worshipped primarily because he is regarded as a pragmatically 
    useful source of advantages in the phenomenal world.  Although I 
    have been able to find very little information on it, apparently the 
    cult of Natha has also spread with little change to other Theravada 
    Buddhist countries, such as Cambodia and Burma.  
         In Nepal, Avalokitesvara is conflated with the Brahman deity 
    Matsyendranath.  He is worshipped in elaborate rituals which are 
    performed by a priestly caste.  Ordination is handed down from 
    father to son, with some important positions being sold to the 
    highest bidder from within the caste.  According to one reporter, 
    the meanings behind the rituals have been largely forgotten.  
    However, they continue to be performed because they are customary 
    and are considered to bring luck.  
          In Tibet, Avalokitesvara has reached a position of tremendous 
    importance.  The stories surrounding him, his integration in the 
    practicalities of life, and his use in meditative practice have all 
    been highly developed.  The Tibetans started with Avalokitesvara 
    (here called Chenrezi) where the Indians left off.  
         Traditional Tibetan belief holds that the cult of 
    Avalokitesvara was brought to Tibet by the eighth century C.E.  
    During the eighth century, King Srong-btsan sgam-po was active in 
    bringing Buddhism to Tibet.  This king is considered an incarnation 
    of Avalokitesvara.  Tibetans traditionally believe that he was 
    active in propagating a cult of Avalokitesvara.  Not long after his 
    reign, Buddhism went into a decline, and did not revive until the 
    eleventh century.  Western scholars believe that although there may 
    have been a small following of the Avalokitesvara cult during the 
    reign of Srong-btsan sgam-po (and there is not much evidence that 
    there was any such cult then), the cult certainly died out between 
    then and the eleventh century.  Traditional Tibetan belief holds 
    that the cult continued in secret during this period.  However, 
    everyone agrees that the cult of Avalokitesvara first became widely 
    popular during the eleventh and twelfth centuries.  
         The belief that Avalokitesvara is the creator of the universe 
    was accepted and elaborated upon.  In Tibetan writings, he is seen 
    as not only creating the world and the Hindu gods, but also as 
    creating the buddhas and the buddha-fields.  The whole cosmos exists 
    as a manifestation of Avalokitesvara's creative activity.  
         This is especially true of Tibet, which is depicted as having a 
    particularly close relationship with Avalokitesvara.  His vow to 
    save all beings becomes a vow to first save Tibetans, because they 
    need his teachings particularly badly and because the Buddha asked 
    him to concentrate on Tibet.  
         Stories arose which describe Avalokitesvara as being intimately 
    involved with the creation of Tibet.  One of the more popular of 
    these stories describes the creation of the Tibetan people.  Once 
    there was a monkey who was an incarnation of Avalokitesvara.  He 
    lived in the mountains, where he practiced meditation.  One day, a 
    demoness saw him and fell in love with him.  She tried 
    unsuccessfully to court him, and finally said that she would bring 
    disaster on all the living beings in the area if he did not marry 
    her.  The monkey was confused, and asked Avalokitesvara what to do.  
    Avalokitesvara told the monkey to marry the demoness.  The monkey 
    and the demoness wed and had six children, who were the progenitors 
    of the Tibetan people.  Thus, all Tibetans are direct descendants of 
    a manifestation of Avalokitesvara.  
         Tibetan Buddhism also produced the innovation of recognizing 
    mortal human beings as the incarnations or manifestations of 
    dieties.  As far as I am aware, Tibet is the only Buddhist country 
    that has this understanding.  Incarnations of Avalokitesvara are 
    particularly important in Tibetan history.  I have already mentioned 
    the progenitor monkey and King Srong-btsan sgam-po.  Another 
    manifestation of Avalokitesvara which plays a crucial role in 
    Tibetan history is the Dalai Lama.  The Dalai Lama has been 
    repeatedly incarnating in Tibet since the fifteenth century.  He is 
    now in his fourteenth incarnation.  The Dalai Lama is the head of 
    the Kagyu-pa school, which is one of the four major schools of 
    Tibetan Buddhism.  Also, from the time of his fifth incarnation in 
    the early seventeenth century until the Chinese conquered Tibet, the 
    Dalai Lama was the ruler of Tibet.  Thus, Tibet was governed by a 
    manifestation of their protective deity, who was also the progenitor 
    of the Tibetan people and the ruler who had brought Buddhism to 
    Tibet.  Further, this deity, and therefore also his manifestation, 
    is the personification of compassion, which should guarantee that 
    his rule is kind and reduces suffering.  
         Avalokitesvara is important not only in Tibetans' understanding 
    of their history, but also in their practice of Buddhist 
    meditation.  Particularly in tantric visualization practices, 
    Avalokitesvara, as the embodiment of compassionate action, is 
    critically important.  In tantra, practitioners create 
    visualizations which are structured so as to bring about 
    experiential realizations of Buddhist teachings2.  In order to 
    understand the purpose of these visualizations, it is necessary to 
    understand the philosophy which the visualizations serve to make 
    experientially real.  
         What is this philosophy?  It is beyond the scope of my paper to 
    lay forth the entire teachings of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, 
    but I will try to briefly outline the philosophies which are most 
    commonly used in tantric visualizations of Avalokitesvara.  
         The most obvious Buddhist teaching used in these practices is 
    the importance of compassion.  What, precisely, is the Buddhist 
    understanding of compassion?  Compassion starts with sorrow at the 
    suffering of others.  As such, it incites action aimed at reducing 
    the suffering of others.  Compassion is the motivating force behind 
    useful action.  It is a warm, positive energy directed towards 
    helping others.  
         Compassion can only arise when we do not have a strong sense of 
    separation from others.  If there is a feeling that I am over here, 
    and you are over there, and we are totally separate individuals, 
    then we will not be able to truly sorrow at each others' pain, 
    because others' pain will not touch us.  In order to truly be 
    touched by the suffering of others, we have to abandon our 
    attachment to sharp divisions between individuals.  We need to live 
    in awareness of the flow of energy between ourselves and others.
