<p>There is a principle whereby the root of faith in the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na can be produced, and I shall explain it.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_60"></A><A HREF="taf16.htm#fr_60">48:1</A> The term Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na here seems not to have been used as it usually is in contrast to the H&icirc;nay&acirc;na. A&ccedil;vaghosha adopts it simply to denote the greatness of suchness (<i>bh&ucirc;talathat&acirc;</i>) as well as to prove its being the safest and surest means of salvation. It is therefore the name given to the first principle itself, and not to any philosophical system or religious dogmatics. But the term used in this wise by A&ccedil;vaghosha and perhaps in earlier Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na texts gradually lost its original sense in the course of the development of this progressive religious view. It was then transferred to distinguish the system at large from that of the so-called &Ccedil;r&acirc;vakas, to which the followers of the former gave in contrast to their own the rather humiliating name H&icirc;nay&acirc;na. At the time of A&ccedil;vaghosha the controversy between them was probably not as vehement as it proved later on. And this fact may be seen from the tolerant spirit shown in the third convocation under the reign of King Kanishka. By the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na followers A&ccedil;vaghosha is unanimously recognised as the forerunner of N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna by whose marvellous genius the system was brought to maturity.</P>
