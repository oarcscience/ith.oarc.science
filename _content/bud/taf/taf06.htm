<p>Let us first decide the date, which varies according to different authorities from three hundred to six hundred years after the Parinirv&acirc;na of Buddha.</p>  
<p>I. The <i>li tai san pao chi</i> (<i>fas</i>. 1),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> quoting the Record of the Sarv&acirc;stiv&acirc;din school, says: "A&ccedil;vaghosha Bodhisattva was born a Brahman in Eastern India some three hundred years after the Nirv&acirc;na.

<p>2. Hui-yuen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> states in his commentary (<i>fas</i>. 1) on the <i>Mah&acirc;-praj&ntilde;&acirc;-p&acirc;ramit&acirc;-&ccedil;&acirc;stra</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the on the authority of Kum&acirc;raj&icirc;va <A NAME="img_00300"></A>

The writer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of the preface to the second Chinese translation of the <i>Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na-&ccedil;raddhotp&acirc;da-&ccedil;&acirc;stra</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> says that this &Ccedil;&acirc;stra "is the deepest of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na texts.

<p>among the four suns [of Buddhists], and his teachings stood most prominently [among the doctrines prevailing] in the five countries of India."</p>  
<p>5. Sang-ying&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> states in his preface to the Chinese translation of the <i>Mah&acirc;-praj&ntilde;&acirc;-p&acirc;ramit&acirc;-&ccedil;&acirc;stra</i> that A&ccedil;vaghosha appeared towards the end of the period of Orthodoxy, i.e., five hundred years after the Nirv&acirc;na.</p>  
<p>6. The <i>Fu tsou t&#8216;ung chi</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (Vol. V.) says that it was the fulfilment of the Tath&acirc;gata's prophecy that six hundred years after the Nirv&acirc;na the Dharma was transmitted to A&ccedil;vaghosha.</p>  
<p>7. This six hundred year prophecy is adopted as if it were an unquestionable fact, by Fa-tsang,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> a learned commentator of the <i>&Ccedil;raddhotp&acirc;da&ccedil;&acirc;stra</i> (<i>Discourse on the Awakening of Faith</i>).</p>  
<p>8. Chih-k&#8216;ai <A NAME="img_00400"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/00400.jpg"> who was the copyist for Param&acirc;rtha when he translated the <i>&Ccedil;raddhotp&acirc;da&ccedil;&acirc;stra</i>, also adheres to the six hundred year tradition in his preface to the book just mentioned, saying that some six hundred years after the Nirv&acirc;na of the Tath&acirc;gata, many devilish heretical leaders clamorously protested their false doctrines against the good law of Buddha,</p>

<p>

<p><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>when a &Ccedil;r&acirc;mana of very high virtue, called A&ccedil;vaghosha, thoroughly versed in the philosophy of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na Buddhism and highly compassionate for those ignorant people, wrote this Discourse (the (<i>&Ccedil;raddhotp&acirc;da&ccedil;&acirc;stra</i>), in order that he might increase the brilliancy of the Triratna, etc., etc.</p>  
<p>9. The six hundred year tradition is very popular among Chinese and Japanese Buddhists. The <A HREF="errata.htm#1"><i>Fo</i></A><i> tsu li tai tung tsai</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (<i>fas</i>. 5) also follows it.</p>  
<p>10. The prophecy above referred to (see No. 8), which is doubtless a later invention, appears in the <i>Mah&acirc;m&acirc;y&acirc; s&ucirc;tra</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (<i>fas</i>. 2) as follows:</p>  
<p>"After the death of Buddha, Mah&acirc;m&acirc;y&acirc; asked &Acirc;nanda if Buddha had ever told him in his life anything concerning the future of Buddhism. Responding to this, &Acirc;nanda said: 'I heard one time Buddha say this with regard to the future decline of Buddhism: "After the Nirv&acirc;na Mah&acirc;k&acirc;&ccedil;yapa with &Acirc;nanda will compile the Dharma-pi&#7789;aka, and when it is settled Mah&acirc;k&acirc;&ccedil;yapa will enter into a Nirodha-sam&acirc;patti in the Lang chi shan [i.e., Mount of Wolf's Track, Kukkurapadagiri], and &Acirc;nanda too obtaining the fruit</p>

<p>of enlightenment will in turn enter into Parinirv&acirc;na, when the right doctrine will be transmitted to Upagupta who will in an excellent manner teach the essence of the Dharma. . . . When five hundred years are passed [after Buddha's death] a Bhikshu named Pao-tien [Ratnadeva?] will in an excellent manner teach the essence of the Dharma, converting twenty thousand people and causing all sentient beings in the eight creations to awaken the Anuttarasamyaksambodhicitta [most-perfect-knowledge-mind]. The right doctrine will then go to decline. When six hundred years [after Buddha's death] are expired, ninety different schools of the t&icirc;rthakas will arise and proclaiming false doctrines, each will struggle against the other to destroy the law of Buddha. Then a Bhikshu, A&ccedil;vaghosha by name, will in an excellent manner teach the essence of the Dharma and defeat all the followers of the t&icirc;rthakas. When seven hundred years [after Buddha's death] are expired, a Bhikshu, N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna by name, will in an excellent manner teach the essence of the Dharma, destroying the banner of false philosophy and lighting the torch of the right doctrine."'"</p>  
<p>II. Referring to the statement of the above mentioned S&ucirc;tra, N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna, a famous Buddhist philosopher who wrote a commentary on A&ccedil;vaghosha's work, called <i>&Ccedil;raddhotp&acirc;da&ccedil;&acirc;stra</i>, claims that there were six A&ccedil;vaghoshas at different times, to fulfil the prophecy of Buddha and that the author of the book on which</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>he writes a commentary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> was one who appeared on earth according to the prophecy in the Mah&acirc;m&acirc;y&acirc; s&ucirc;tra. N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna even states that he was a disciple of A&ccedil;vaghosha, but the work itself is regarded as spurious,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>on account of some obvious contradictions, though the followers of the Mantra sect (<i>Shingonshyu</i>) insist on its genuineness, because they are anxious to have an ancient authority for their own mystic doctrines, which are here supported.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Deeply absorbed in metaphysical speculation, the inhabitants of India paid very little attention to history, and whenever we endeavor to ascertain the date of important historical figures we are sure to find our way to certainty barred. So we cannot decide which of the conflicting traditions above enumerated is to be considered as authentic. When taken independently of other historical events which are connected with them and whose dates have been already fixed, they have no value whatever. Besides it should be observed, the chronology of Buddha, to which every one of the traditions makes reference, is as yet unsettled and must have been still more so at the time when those traditions were current in India as well as in China. If they differed as to the date of Buddha, they might have maintained the same date for A&ccedil;vaghosha; no one can tell. We have to seek a light from another source.</p>  
<p>Another group of traditions centering around A&ccedil;vaghosha is his connexion with a most powerful king of Y&uuml;eh chih <A NAME="img_00900"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/00900.jpg">, who established his extensive kingdom in Northwestern India. Who was this king? In the <A NAME="img_00901"></A>

Chinese <A NAME="img_01000"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/01000.jpg"> <i>chan-lan-chi-ni-ch&#8216;a</i>) had a close friendship with three wise men: the first one was a Bodhisattva, called A&ccedil;vaghosha; the second, a minister of state called Mo-cha-lo (Ma&#7789;hara or Madara?); the third, an experienced physician called Ch&ecirc;-lo-chia (Caraka). With these three the king was on most intimate terms and treated them with the utmost cordiality, permitting them to approach his person. A&ccedil;vaghosha said [one day] to him that if he [the king] would follow his advice, he would obtain in his coming life everything that was good, eternally put an end to all his misfortunes and forever be free from evil." . . .&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p><A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>A&ccedil;vaghosha's relation with King Candana Kanish&#7789;ha (or Kan&icirc;ta? Chinese Chi-ni-ch&#8216;a) is told also in the <i>Fu fa tsang yin y&uuml;an ch&#8216;uan</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <i>fas</i>. 5:</p>  
<p>"[At that time]. the king of Tukh&acirc;ra was very powerful. He was called Candana Kanish&#7789;ha [or Kan&icirc;ta? Chinese Chi-ni-ch&#8216;a]. Being very ambitious and bold, and far superior in courage to all his contemporaries, every country he invaded was sure to be trampled down under his feet. So when he advanced his four armies towards P&acirc;&#7789;aliputra [Hua shih ch&#8216;&ecirc;ng in Chinese], the latter was doomed to defeat in spite of some desperate engagements. The king demanded an indemnity of 900,000,000 gold pieces, for which the defeated king offered A&ccedil;vaghosha, the Buddha-bowl and a compassionate fowl, each being considered worth 300,900,000 gold pieces. The Bodhisattva A&ccedil;vaghosha had intellectual powers inferior to none; the Buddha-bowl having been carried by the Tath&acirc;gata himself is full of merits; the fowl being of compassionate nature, would not drink any water with worms in it,--thus all these having merits enough to keep off all enemies, they are on that account worth</p>

<p><A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> 900,000,000 gold pieces.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The king [of Tukh&acirc;ra] was greatly pleased at receiving them, and immediately withdrawing his army from the land went back to his own kingdom."</p>  
<p>We have the same legend stated in a brief biography&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of A&ccedil;vaghosha as follows:</p>  
<p>"After that a king of the smaller Y&uuml;eh chih country [i.e., Tukh&acirc;ra] in North India invaded the Middle country [i.e., Magadha]. When the besieging had continued for some time, the king of Central India sent a message [to the invader] saying: 'If there be anything you want, I will supply it; do not disturb the peace of my people by thus long staying here,' to which this reply was given: 'If you really ask a surrender, send me 300,000,000 gold pieces; I will release you.' The [besieged] king said: 'Even this entire kingdom cannot produce 100,000,000 gold pieces, how can I supply you with 300,000,000?' The answer was: 'There are in your country two great treasures: (1) the Buddha-bowl,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (2) a Bhikshu of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_13"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>wonderful talent (i.e., A&ccedil;vaghosha). Give them to me, they are worth 300,000,000 gold pieces.' The [besieged] king said: 'Those two treasures are what I most revere, I cannot give them up.' Thereupon the Bhikshu said to the king in explanation of the Dharma:</p>  
<p>"'All sentient beings are everywhere the same, while Buddhism, deep and comprehensive, aims at universal salvation, and the highest virtue of a great man consists in delivering [all] beings. As our temporal administration is very liable to meet obstructions, even your rule does not extend itself outside of this one kingdom. If you, on the other hand, propose a wide propagation of Buddhism, you would naturally be a Dharmar&acirc;ja over the four oceans. The duty of a Bhikshu is to save [all] the people and not to give preference to one or the other. Merits lie in our heart; truth makes no distinction. Pray, be farsighted, and do not think only of the present.'</p>  
<p>"The king who was from the first a great admirer of him, respectfully followed his advice and delivered him to the king of Y&uuml;eh chih who returned with him to his own kingdom."</p>  
<p>Comparing all these traditions, we are naturally led to the conclusion that A&ccedil;vaghosha, who was numbered as one of the four suns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of Buddhism, must have</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_14"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>had a very powerful influence over the spiritual India of the time, that the king who wished to have him as a spiritual adviser must have been a very devoted Buddhist so as to accept a Bhikshu instead of an enormous sum of money, and that such a devoted Buddhist king, ruling over the vast domain which extended from the bank of the Indus towards the lower Ganges, must have been living sometime between the third and sixth century after the Nirv&acirc;na, whatever the authentic date of Buddha might be. The next conclusion we can advance therefore will be the identification of this king who is called Candana Kanish&#7789;ha or Kan&icirc;ta in the above stories, with Kanishka,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the originator of the third Buddhist convocation in Kashmir.</p>  
<p>As to the difference of the name, we have to say this. While Hs&uuml;en-tsang's transliteration for Kanishka is Chia-ni-sh&ecirc;-chia <A NAME="img_01400"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/01400.jpg"> which is quite an approximate reproduction of the original sounds, the Chinese method of transliteration before his time by the so-called "old translators" was rather irregular, loose and therefore often misleading. Add to this the liability to error on the part of local dialects, and we do not improperly identify Chi-ni-ch&#8216;a, with Kanishka, while the former may be Sanskritised Kanish&#7789;a or Kan&icirc;ta.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>In further support of this view, we quote from the <i>Journal of the Buddhist Text Society</i>, Vol. I., Part 3, an article on King Kanishka, taken from a Tibetan source, which bears a more historical appearance than the legends above referred to. The abstract is:</p>  
<p>"Kanishka, king of Palh&acirc;va and Delhi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> was born four hundred years after the Nirv&acirc;na. When he learned that Simha, king of Kashmir, abandoned the worldly life to become a Buddhist priest under the name of Sudar&ccedil;ana and obtained Arhatship, he went to Kashmir and heard a sermon delivered by Sudar&ccedil;ana.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> At that time a Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na priest who held a most prominent</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>position in northern countries was called A&ccedil;vaghosha. His influence in the spiritual world was as incomparable as the temporal power of Kanishka who conquered Kashmir and J&acirc;lamdhara. The king sent a message to A&ccedil;vaghosha to come to his kingdom, who, however, owing to his old age, could not accept the invitation, but sent him a leading disciple of his called J&ntilde;&acirc;naya&ccedil;a, accompanied with a letter treating the essential points of Buddhism."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Though the Tibetan tradition considerably differs in many respects from the Chinese accounts above mentioned, they both agree in this point that A&ccedil;vaghosha and Kanishka had some intercourse, or that at least they were contemporaneous and known to each other. So we may take it as an established fact that A&ccedil;vaghosha, the author of the <A NAME="img_01600"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/01600.jpg"> <i>Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na-&ccedil;raddhotp&acirc;da-&ccedil;&acirc;stra</i> (<i>Discourse on the Awakening of Faith in the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na</i>), was living at the time of Kanishka.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>I do not think there is any need here to enumerate all different opinions about the time of Kanishka, which has been already approximately fixed by the untiring investigation of European scholars, such as Princep, Lassen, Cunningham, Wilson, Fergusson,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Max M&uuml;ller, and others.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> So long as our present aim is to assign the time of A&ccedil;vaghosha more definitely than stating vaguely some three or five hundred years after the Nirv&acirc;na of Buddha, suffice it to say that he lived at the time extending from the latter half of the first century before Christ to about 50 or 80 A. D. If we fix the date of Buddha's death in the fifth century before Christ, A&ccedil;vaghosha must be said to have lived during the six hundredth year after the Nirv&acirc;na. At the very most his time cannot be placed later than the first century of the Christian era.</p>  
<p>I have spared no pains, even at the risk of tediousness, in gathering all the information obtainable from Chinese sources relative to the date of A&ccedil;vaghosha, because this date is of paramount importance when we enter into the discussion of the development of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na Buddhism, which is commonly and erroneously considered to be the sole work of N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna.</p>

<p>"In all there were six A&ccedil;vaghoshas, owing to different predictions in the s&ucirc;tras; each of them appeared to fulfil his mission according to the necessity of the time, and there is no contradiction in them."</p>

<p>"When we examine all different predictions in the s&ucirc;tras taught by Buddha through his whole life, we find six different [personages all called A&ccedil;vaghosha]. What are those six? (1) According to the <A NAME="img_00701"></A>

If even the world-honored one, full of great love, is going to another world, leaving his own children behind him, why then could not I who am not yet full of love and compassion go to another world following Buddha's steps? Who can blame me?' When finished uttering these words, A&ccedil;vaghosha gazed at the pupil of Buddha's eye and gradually passed out of life. (2) The <A NAME="img_00702"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/00702.jpg"> <i>Pien &#8216;hua kung t&ecirc; ch&#8216;i ching</i> (<i>Vikriy&acirc;punyas&ucirc;tra</i>?) says: Then the Bhagavat said to A&ccedil;vaghosha: 'Three hundred years after my Nirv&acirc;na thou shalt obtain an inspiration from me and with various methods (<i>up&acirc;ya</i>) <A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A> benefit and make happy all beings in coming generations.

<IMG SRC="img/00800.jpg"> <i>Mah&acirc;m&acirc;y&acirc;s&ucirc;tra</i> says as follows: 'When six hundred years are passed after the disappearance of the Tath&acirc;gata, ninety-six different schools of the t&icirc;rthakas will arise, and professing false doctrines, each will struggle against the other to destroy the law of Buddha. A Bhikshu called A&ccedil;vaghosha, however, will in an excellent manner proclaim the essence of the Dharma and defeat all followers of the t&icirc;rthakas. (4) In the <A NAME="img_00801"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/00801.jpg"> <i>Ch&#8216;ang t&ecirc; san mei ch&#8216;i ching</i> (<i>S&ucirc;tra on the Sam&acirc;dhi of Eternal Merit</i>) we read: In the eight hundredth year after the Nirv&acirc;na there will be a wise man, A&ccedil;vaghosha by name. Among the followers of the t&icirc;rthakas as well as those of Buddhism, he will refute all those who cherish heretical views and will establish the Dharma taught by Buddha.

<IMG SRC="img/00802.jpg"> <i>Mo ni ch&#8216;ing ch&#8216;i ching</i> (<i>Manivim&acirc;las&ucirc;tra</i>?) is said thus: About one hundred years after the Nirv&acirc;na of Buddha, A&ccedil;vaghosha Mah&acirc;sattva will appear on earth protect the right doctrine and safely hoist the banner of Buddhism.

<IMG SRC="img/00803.jpg">. <i>Sh&ecirc;ng ting wang ch&#8216;i ching</i> (<i>Crim&ucirc;rdhar&acirc;jas&ucirc;tra</i>?) is said thus: On the seventeenth day after the enlightenment of Buddha there was a t&icirc;rthaka called <A NAME="img_00804"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/00804.jpg"> Chia-lo-no-chiu-shih-to (K&acirc;lanakshi&#7789;a?), who transforming himself into the figure of a great n&acirc;gar&acirc;ja (i.e., snake-king) with 86,000 heads and 86,000 tongues, simultaneously proposed 86,000 contradicting questions and asked the Tath&acirc;gata [for the solution]. He then gave him a triple answer explaining all those paradoxes. The n&acirc;gar&acirc;ja then proposed tenfold questions, again asking the Tath&acirc;gata [for their solution], to which he gave a hundredfold answers and explained their paradoxes. When this dialogue came to an end, Buddha said to the n&acirc;gar&acirc;ja: 'Very good, very good, O A&ccedil;vaghosha &Ccedil;r&acirc;mana! in order to guard the castle of the Dharma, thou hast assumed this form of destruction, establishing <A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A> the doctrine of Buddha. Be patient, be patient, always discipline thyself in this way, always behave thyself in this way, do not go round in a small circle, but make a universal tour.' The n&acirc;gar&acirc;ja then abandoning his assumed beast-form revealed his own real character and approaching the peerless, honored one and saluting him said rejoicingly in verse, etc., etc. This is the sixth A&ccedil;vaghosha."</P>

<IMG SRC="img/01402.jpg"> is a single Chinese character appearing in the <i>Mah&acirc;lamk&acirc;ra&ccedil;&acirc;stra</i> (<i>Book of Great Glory</i>), the work ascribed to A&ccedil;vaghosha. In <i>fas</i>. 3 as well as <i>fas</i>. 6 of the <A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A> same book referring to Candana Kanish&#7789;ha or Kan&icirc;ta, the writer says: "<A NAME="img_01500"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/01500.jpg"> <i>Wo hsi ch&#8216;ang w&ecirc;n, chan-t&#8216;an chi-ni-ch&acirc; wang</i>," i.e., "I heard of old that King Candana Kanish&#7789;ha," etc. (in <i>fas</i>. 6., chia-ni-ch&#8216;a), etc., etc. The Chinese character <i>hsi</i> usually means "of yore" or "in olden times," but it also signifies the past indefinitely, near as well as distant. If we thus understand the term in the sense of "some time ago," or simply "once," there will be no difficulty in demonstrating that A&ccedil;vaghosha was an elder contemporary of Kanishka, though we cannot apparently accept the Chinese tradition which says they were intimately known to each other. Because in that case A&ccedil;vaghosha would not refer to the king in such a hearsay manner as stated in the book above mentioned. Taking all in all, this does not prevent us asserting that they were contemporaneous.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_28"></A><A HREF="taf06.htm#fr_28">15:1</A> Cf. A. Schiefner's German translation of T&acirc;ran&acirc;tha's <i>History of Buddhism</i>, p. 89: "Nachdem K&ouml;nig &Ccedil;r&icirc;tschandra die Herrschaft ausge&uuml;bt hatte, waren viele Jahre vergangen, als im Westen im Lande Tili und M&auml;lava ein an Jahren junger K&ouml;nig Kanika in die Herrschaft gew&auml;hlt wurde."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_29"></A><A HREF="taf06.htm#fr_29">15:2</A> T&acirc;ran&acirc;tha's statement differs from this. According to him Kanika and Kanishka are not the same king, the former being that of Tili and M&acirc;lava, while the latter that of J&acirc;lamdhara. <i>Vide</i> pp. <A HREF="taf21.htm#page_58">58</A> and <A HREF="taf22.htm#page_90">90</A>. T&acirc;ran&acirc;tha might have confused them.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_30"></A><A HREF="taf06.htm#fr_30">16:1</A> T&acirc;ran&acirc;tha also states this event (<i>Geschichte des Buddhismus</i>, p. 92). But the king is not Kanishka, but Kanika; and the name of the disciple is not J&ntilde;&acirc;naya&ccedil;a, but Dschn&acirc;nakriya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_31"></A><A HREF="taf06.htm#fr_31">16:2</A> A further corroboration of this view will be met with when we treat later on of the conversion of A&ccedil;vaghosha by Par&ccedil;va or his disciple Pu&#7751;yaya&ccedil;as.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_32"></A><A HREF="taf06.htm#fr_32">17:1</A> Max M&uuml;ller's opinion, as stated before, is that Kanishka lived A. D. 85-106; Lassen thinks the Gondopharean dynasty was succeeded by Kanishka, king of the Y&uuml;eh chih, about one hundred years before Christ; Princep places his reign during the first century A. D.; Cunningham thinks his consecration was 58 A. D.; Fergusson, 79 A. D.; Rhys Davids, about 10 A. D., etc.</P>
