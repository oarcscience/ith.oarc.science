</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">II. GENERAL STATEMENT.</h3>  
<p>In what does the general statement consist?</p>  
<p>The Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na can be briefly treated as to two aspects, namely, What it is, and What it signifies.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A></p>  
<p>What is the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na? It is the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of all sentient beings (<i>sarvasattva</i>), that constitutes all things in the world, phenomenal and supra-phenomenal;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and through this soul we can disclose what the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na signifies.</p>  
<p>Because the soul in itself, involving the quintessence of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na, is suchness (<i>bh&ucirc;tatathat&acirc;</i>), but it becomes [in its relative or transitory aspect, through the law of causation] birth-and-death (<i>sams&acirc;ra</i>) in which are revealed the quintessence, the attributes, and the activity of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na.</p>  
<p>The Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na has a triple significance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The first is the greatness of quintessence. Because the quintessence of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na as suchness</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A></p>  
<p>exists in all things, remains unchanged in the pure as well as in the defiled, is always one and the same (<i>samat&acirc;</i>), neither increases nor decreases, and is void of distinction.</p>  
<p>The second is the greatness of attributes. Here we have the Tath&acirc;gata's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> womb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (<i>tath&acirc;gatagarbha</i>) which in exuberance contains immeasurable and innumerable merits (<i>punya</i>) as its characteristics.</p>  
<p>The third is the greatness of activity, for it [i.e., Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na] produces all kinds of good work in the world, phenomenal and supra-phenomenal. [Hence the name Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na (great vehicle).]</p>  
<p>[Again this Dharma is called the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na;] because it is the vehicle}&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (<i>y&acirc;na</i>) in which all Buddhas</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A></p>  
<p>from the beginning have been riding, and Bodhisattvas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> when riding in it will enter into the state of Buddhahood.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_68"></A><A HREF="taf18.htm#fr_68">52:1</A> "What is" and "What signifies" are respectively in Chinese <i>yu fa</i> <A NAME="img_05200"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/05200.jpg"> and <i>fa</i> <A NAME="img_05201"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/05201.jpg">, but in the older translation <i>fa</i> <A NAME="img_05201"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/05201.jpg"> and <i>i</i> <A NAME="img_05202"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/05202.jpg">. This is a little puzzling, but if we bear in mind that in Chinese as well as in Sanskrit <i>fa</i> or <i>dharma</i> means both the substance itself and its attribute or significance, or law that regulates its movements, we will understand that Param&acirc;rtha, the first translator, used <i>fa</i> here in the sense of substance or "what is," while &Ccedil;iksh&acirc;nanda, the second translator, used the word in the sense of significance or that by which a thing is conceived, the ordinary meaning of <i>i</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_69"></A><A HREF="taf18.htm#fr_69">53:1</A> "Soul '' is not used here in a dualistic sense, but as Dr. Paul Carus defines it in the last chapter of <i>The Soul of Man</i>. Speaking of the soul of the universe he defines the term as "the formative principle which gave and still gives shape to the world" (<i>loc. cit.</i>, first edition, p. 437). The literal translation of the Chinese character <A NAME="img_05300"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/05300.jpg"> <i>hsin</i> is kernel, or heart, or essence of all things. The Chinese <i>hsin</i>, however, is rather indiscriminately used in our text for both Sanskrit terms, <i>Hrdaya</i> (kernel or heart) and <i>Citta</i> (mind, the thinking faculty). These terms are more or less synonymous, especially from A&ccedil;vaghosha's standpoint, that does not allow the transcendental existence of a metaphysical soul-entity. In this translation soul denotes the absolute aspect of suchness, and mind its relative aspect, wherever this distinction is noticeable.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_70"></A><A HREF="taf18.htm#fr_70">53:2</A> This is a literal translation of the Chinese <i>chu shi chien</i> <A NAME="img_05301"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/05301.jpg">. It signifies anything transcending conditionality or worldliness.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_71"></A><A HREF="taf18.htm#fr_71">53:3</A> This triad which has a striking similarity to Spinoza's conception of substance, attributes and modes, also reminds us of the first principles (<i>pad&acirc;rtha</i>) of the Vai&ccedil;eshika philosophy, that is, substance (<i>dravya</i>), qualities (<i>guna</i>), and action (<i>karma</i>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_72"></A><A HREF="taf18.htm#fr_72">54:1</A> Tath&acirc;gata literally means one who thus or truly comes. That the omnipresent principle of suchness could come or go appeared contradictory and seemed to render an explanation necessary. The Vajracchedik&acirc;-S&ucirc;tra, Max M&uuml;ller's English translation, Chap. XXIX: "And again, O Subh&ucirc;ti, if anybody were to say that the Tath&acirc;gata goes, or comes, or stands, or sits, or lies down, he, O Subh&ucirc;ti, does not understand the meaning of my preaching. And why? Because the word Tath&acirc;gata means one who does not go anywhere, and does not come from anywhere; and therefore he is called the Tath&acirc;gata (truly come), holy and fully enlightened."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_73"></A><A HREF="taf18.htm#fr_73">54:2</A> Cf. the <i>Bhavadg&icirc;t&acirc;</i> (<i>Sacred Books of the East</i>, Vol. VIII., Chap. XIV., p. 107): "The great Brahman is a womb for me, in which I cast the seed. From that, O descendant of Bharata! is the birth of all things. Of the bodies, O son of Kunt&icirc;! which are born from all wombs, the main womb is the great Brahman, and I am the father, the giver of the seed."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_74"></A><A HREF="taf18.htm#fr_74">54:3</A> Cf. the <i>Saddharma-pundar&icirc;ka</i>, Chap. II. (<i>Sacred Books of the East</i>, Vol. XXI., p. 40): "By means of one sole vehicle, to wit, the Buddha-vehicle, &Ccedil;&acirc;riputra, do I teach creatures the law; there is no second, nor a third."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_75"></A><A HREF="taf18.htm#fr_75">55:1</A> Literally, one who seeks perfect enlightenment, or one who is full of wisdom and compassion.</P>
