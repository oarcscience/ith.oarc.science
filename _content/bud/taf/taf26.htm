</p>  <h5 align="center"><i>b. Belief in the Existence of Atman in Things.</i></h5>  
<p>As the World-honored One (<i>Bhagavat</i>), considering the inferior intellectual calibre of &Ccedil;r&acirc;vakas and Pratyekabuddhas, taught them only the doctrine of non-personal &acirc;tman, [and did not make any further</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A></p>  
<p>demonstration of the doctrine], the people have in the meantime formed a fixed idea on the transitoriness of the five skandhas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and, being terrified at the thought of birth and death, have fanatically craved for Nirv&acirc;na.</p>  
<p>In order that this clinging may be eliminated, be it clearly understood that the essence of the five skandhas is uncreate, there is no annihilation of them; that since there is no annihilation of them, they are in their [metaphysical] origin Nirv&acirc;na itself; that if one be absolutely freed from particularisation and attachment, one will understand that all things both pure and defiled have only relative existence.</p>  
<p>Be it therefore known that all things in the world from the beginning are neither matter (<i>r&ucirc;pa</i>), nor mind (<i>citta</i>), nor intelligence (<i>praj&ntilde;&acirc;</i>), nor consciousness (<i>vij&ntilde;&acirc;na</i>), nor non-being (<i>abh&acirc;va</i>), nor being (<i>bh&acirc;va</i>); they are after all inexplicable. The reason why the Tath&acirc;gata nevertheless endeavors to instruct by means of words and definitions is through his good and excellent skilfulness [or expediency, <i>up&acirc;ya-kau&ccedil;alya</i>].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> He only provisionally makes use of words and definitions to lead all beings, while his real object is to make them abandon symbolism and directly enter</p>

<p>into the real reality (<i>tattva</i>). Because if they indulge themselves in reasonings, attach themselves to sophistry, and thus foster their subjective particularisation, how could they have the true wisdom (<i>tattvaj&ntilde;&acirc;na</i>) and attain to Nirv&acirc;na?</p>
