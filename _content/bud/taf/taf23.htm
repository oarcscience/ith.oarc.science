<p>Again the quintessence and the attributes of suchness (<i>bh&ucirc;tatathat&acirc;</i>) know no diminution or addition, but remain the same in common people (<i>prthagjana</i>), &Ccedil;r&acirc;vakas, Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. It was not created in the past, nor is it to be annihilated in the future; it is eternal, permanent, absolute; and from all eternity it sufficingly embraces in its essence all possible merits (<i>punya</i>).</p>  
<p>That is to say, suchness has such characteristics as follows: the effulgence of great wisdom; the universal illumination of the dharmadh&acirc;tu [universe]; the true and adequate knowledge; the mind pure and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A></p>  
<p>clean in its self-nature; the eternal, the blessed, the self-regulating and the pure;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the tranquil, the immutable, and the free. And there is no heterogeneity in all those Buddha-dharmas which, outnumbering the sands of the Ganges, can be neither identical (<i>ek&acirc;rtha</i>) nor not-identical (<i>n&acirc;n&acirc;rtha</i>) [with the essence of suchness], and which therefore are out of the range of our comprehension. Accordingly suchness is called the Tath&acirc;gata's womb (<i>tath&acirc;gatagarbha</i>) or the Dharmak&acirc;ya.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>It may be questioned: While it was stated before that suchness is devoid of all characteristics (<i>lakshana</i>), how can it now be said without contradiction that it embraces in full all such merits?</p>  
<p>In reply it would be said that though suchness in truth abundantly embraces all merits, yet it is free in its nature from all forms of distinction; because all objects in the world are of one and the same taste, are of one reality, have nothing to do with the modes of particularisation, and are not of dualistic character. Depending on the principle of birth-and-death, such as the activity-consciousness (<i>karmavij&ntilde;&acirc;na</i>?), etc., however, all signs of difference and individuation appear.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A></p>  
<p>How are those qualifications to be assigned to suchness?</p>  
<p>Though all things in their [metaphysical] origin come from the soul alone and in truth free from particularisation, yet on account of non-enlightenment there originates a subjective mind [i.e., <i>&acirc;laya-vij&ntilde;&acirc;na</i>] that becomes conscious of an external world (<i>vishaya</i>). This we call ignorance (<i>avidya</i>). Nevertheless the essence of the mind [or the soul] is perfectly pure, and there is no awakening of ignorance in it. Thence we assign to suchness this quality, the effulgence of great wisdom.</p>  
<p>If the mind being awakened perceive an external world, then there will be something that cannot be perceived by it. But the essence of the mind has nothing to do with perception [which presupposes the dual existence of a perceiving subject and an object perceived]; so there is nothing that cannot be perceived by it, [that is, the world of relativity is submerged in the oneness of suchness]. Thence we assign to suchness this quality, the universal illumination of the universe (<i>dharmadh&acirc;tu</i>).</p>  
<p>When the mind is disturbed, it fails to be a true and adequate knowledge; it fails to be a pure, clean essence; it fails to be eternal, blissful, self-regulating, and pure; it fails to be tranquil, etc. On the contrary, it will become transient, changeable, unfree, and therefore the source of falsity and defilement, while its modifications outnumber the sands of the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Ganges. But when there is no disturbance in the essence of the mind, we speak of suchness as being the true, adequate knowledge, etc., and as possessing pure and clean merits that outnumber the sands of the Ganges.</p>  
<p>When the mind is disturbed it will strive to become conscious of the existence of an external world and will thus betray the imperfection of its inner condition. But as all infinite merits in fact constitute the one mind which, perfect in itself, has no need of seeking after any external things other than itself, so suchness never fails to actualise all those Buddha-dharmas, that, outnumbering the sands of the Ganges, can be said to be neither identical nor non-identical with the essence of the mind, and that therefore are utterly out of the range of our comprehension. On that account suchness is designated the Tath&acirc;gata's womb (<i>tath&acirc;gatagarbha</i>) or the Tath&acirc;gata's Dharmak&acirc;ya.</p>  
<p align="justify'">What is meant by the activity of suchness is this: all Buddhas, while at the stage of discipline, feel a deep compassion (<i>mah&acirc;karun&acirc;</i>) [for all beings], practise all p&acirc;ramit&acirc;s, the four methods of entertainment (<i>catv&acirc;ri-sangrahavast&ucirc;ni</i>), and many other meritorious deeds-treat others as their own self, wish to work out a universal salvation of mankind in ages to come, through limitless numbers of kalpas; recognise truthfully and adequately the principle of equality (<i>samat&acirc;</i>)</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A></p>  
<p>among people; and do not cling to the individual existence of a sentient being.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>By virtue of such a great wisdom that works means of emancipation (<i>up&acirc;y&acirc;j&ntilde;&acirc;</i>?),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> they annihilate ignorance that knows no beginning; recognise the Dharmak&acirc;ya in its original purity; spontaneously perform incomprehensible karma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> as well as various unfettered moral activities; manifest themselves throughout the universe (<i>dharmadh&acirc;tu</i>), identify themselves with suchness, and leave no traces of compulsion.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>And how is this?</p>  
<p>Because all Tath&acirc;gatas are the Dharmak&acirc;ya itself,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> are the highest truth (<i>param&acirc;rthasatya</i>) itself,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and have nothing to do with conditionality (<i>samvrittisatya</i>) and compulsory actions; whereas the seeing, hearing, etc. [i.e., the particularising senses] of the sentient being diversify [on its own account] the activity of Tath&acirc;gatas.</p>  
<p>Now this activity [in another word, the Dharmak&acirc;ya] has a twofold aspect. The first one depends on the phenomena-particularising-consciousness, by means of which the activity is conceived by the minds of common people (<i>prthagjana</i>), &Ccedil;r&acirc;vakas, and Pratyekabuddhas. This aspect is called the Body of Transformation (<i>nirm&acirc;nak&acirc;ya</i>).</p>  
<p>But as the beings of this class do not know that the Body of Transformation is merely the shadow [or reflection] of their own evolving-consciousness (<i>pravrtti-vij&ntilde;&acirc;na</i>), they imagine that it comes from some external sources, and so they give it a corporeal limitation. But the Body of Transformation [or what amounts to the same thing, the Dharmak&acirc;ya] has nothing to do with limitation and measurement.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The second aspect [of the Dharmak&acirc;ya] depends on the activity-consciousness (<i>karmavij&ntilde;&acirc;na</i>) by means of which the activity is conceived by the minds of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_101"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 101</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Bodhisattvas while passing from their first aspiration (<i>cittotp&acirc;da</i>) stage up to the height of Bodhisattvahood. This is called the Body of Bliss (<i>sambhogak&acirc;ya</i>).</p>  
<p>The body has infinite forms. The form has infinite attributes. The attribute has infinite excellencies. And the accompanying rewards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of Bodhisattvas, that is, the region where they are predestined to be born [by their previous karma], also has infinite merits and ornamentations. Manifesting itself everywhere, the Body of Bliss is infinite, boundless, limitless, unintermittent [in its action], directly coming forth from the mind.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>All these merits being actualised through the perfuming of such spotless deeds as the p&acirc;ramit&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, etc., as well as through the incomprehensible perfuming power [of enlightenment <i>a priori</i>], the Sambhogak&acirc;ya</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A></p>  
<p>embraces infinite attributes of bliss and merit. Therefore it is also called the Body of Reward.</p>  
<p>What is recognised by common people (<i>prthagjana</i>), etc., is the coarsest form of the activity of the Dharmak&acirc;ya. There is a variety of it according to the six different states of creation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> It has no attributes of infinite merits and blessings.</p>  
<p>What is recognised by Bodhisattvas at the first stage is a finer form of the activity of the Dharmak&acirc;ya. As they firmly believe in suchness, they can have a partial insight into it, and understand that the Body of the Tath&acirc;gata is not departing, is not coming, is free from arrest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> [i.e., the Tath&acirc;gata's work is eternal and constant], that every thing is but a reflected shadow of the mind, not independent of suchness. But these Bodhisattvas have not yet freed themselves from the finest form of particularisation, because they have not yet entered into the order of the Dharmak&acirc;ya.</p>  
<p>Bodhisattvas at the stage of pure-heartedness are able to recognise the finer form of the activity [of the Dharmak&acirc;ya]. Their insight is more penetrating than the former. When they reach the height of Bodhisattvahood their insight becomes perfect.</p>  
<p>By the finer form of the activity we understand</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the Body of Bliss (<i>sambhogak&acirc;ya</i>). As long as they are possessed by the activity-consciousness, they would conceive the Body of Bliss.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> But when they are liberated from it, all traces of individuation would become obliterated. Because all Tath&acirc;gatas come from [one and the same] Dharmak&acirc;ya, have no distinction of this-ness and that-ness, have no corporeal forms that are characterised by reciprocal limitation.</p>  
<p>A question arises here: If the Dharmak&acirc;ya of Buddhas is devoid of variously differentiated corporeal forms, how is it that it can manifest itself in various corporeal forms at all?</p>  
<p>In reply we say: The Dharmak&acirc;ya can manifest itself in various corporeal forms just because it is the real essence of them. Matter (<i>r&ucirc;pa</i>) and mind (<i>citta</i>) from the very beginning are not a duality. So we speak of [the universe as] a system of rationality (<i>praj&ntilde;ak&acirc;ya</i>), seeing that the real nature of matter just constitutes the norm of mind. Again we speak of [the universe as] a system of materiality (<i>dharmak&acirc;ya</i>), seeing that the true nature of mind just constitutes the norm of matter.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Now depending on the Dharmak&acirc;ya, all Tath&acirc;gatas manifest themselves in bodily forms and are incessantly</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></p>  
<p>present at all points of space.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And Bodhisattvas in the ten quarters, according to their capabilities and wishes, are able to manifest infinite Bodies of Bliss and infinite lands of ornamentation, each one of which, though stamped with the marks of individuality, does not hinder the others from being fused into it, and this [mutual fusion] has no interruption.</p>  
<p>But the manifestation of the Dharmak&acirc;ya in [infinite] bodily forms is not comprehensible to the thought and understanding of common-people; because it is the free and subtlest activity of suchness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Again, in order that all beings might be induced to step forward from the gate of birth-and-death to that of suchness, we endeavor to let them understand that those modes of existence such as matter (<i>r&ucirc;pa</i>), etc. [i.e., the five skandhas]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are imperfect.</p>  
<p>Why are they imperfect?</p>  
<p>When we divide some gross [or composite] matter, we can reduce it to atoms (<i>anu</i>). But as the atom will also be subject to further division, all forms of material existence, whether gross or fine, are nothing but the shadow of particularisation produced by a subjective mind, and we cannot ascribe any degree of [absolute, or independent] reality to them.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Let us next go over to and examine the other skandhas [that have temporal existence]. We find there too that we can gradually reduce them to kshanas [i.e., infinitesimal divisions of time], whose nature, however closely scrutinised, does not give any sign of [indivisible] oneness.</p>  
<p>It is even the same with the objects of non-aggregate (<i>asamskrta-dharma</i>).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> They cannot have their own existence independent of the universe (<i>dharmadh&acirc;tu</i>). Be it therefore understood that the same may be said in regard to all objects without exception in the ten quarters of space.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>As a lost man who takes the east for the west,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A></p>  
<p>while the quarter is not changed on account of his confusion, so all beings, because of their misleading ignorance, imagine that the mind is being disturbed, while in reality it is not.</p>  
<p>But when they understand that the disturbance of the mind [i.e., birth-and-death] is [at the same time] immortality [viz., suchness], they would then enter into the gate of suchness.</p>

To quote his own words: "Als Natur aber erscheint ein Produkt der Kunst dadurch, dass zwar alle P&uuml;nktlichkeit in der Uebereinkunft mit Regeln, nach denen allein das Produkt das werden kann, was es sein soll, angetroffen wird, aber ohne Peinlichkeit, d. i., ohne eine Spur zu zeigen, dass die Regel dem K&uuml;nstler vor Augen geschwebt und seinen Gem&uuml;thskr&auml;ften Fesseln angelegt habe."
