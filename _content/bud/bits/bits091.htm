<P ALIGN="center"><SMALL>Translated from the Anguttara-Nik&acirc;ya (iii.18).</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If wandering ascetics, O priests, members of another sect, were to say to you, 'Sirs, is it in order to be reborn in the world of the gods that the monk Gotama leads a holy life?' would ye not, O priests, if that question were put to you, be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe the idea?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Reverend Sir."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it appears, O priests, that ye are distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe the idea of life in heaven, heavenly beauty, heavenly happiness, heavenly glory; that ye are distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe the idea of heavenly power. But much more, O priests, should ye be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the body; be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the voice; be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the mind."</P>
