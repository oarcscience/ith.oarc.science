<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time a certain priest had been killed by the bite of a snake, and when they announced the matter to The Blessed One, he said:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely now, O priests, that priest never suffused the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness. For if, O priests, that priest had suffused the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness, that priest, O priests, would not have been killed by the bite of a snake. And what are the four royal families of the snakes? The Vir&ucirc;pakkhas are a royal family of snakes; the Er&acirc;pathas are a royal family of snakes; the Chaby&acirc;puttas are a royal family of snakes; the Kanh&acirc;gotamakas are a royal family of snakes. Surely, now, O priests, that priest did not suffuse the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness. For surely, O priests, if that priest had suffused the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness, that priest, O priests, would not have been killed by the bite of a snake. I enjoin, O priests, that ye suffuse these four royal families of the snakes with your friendliness; and that ye sing a song of defence for your protection and safeguard. After this manner, O priests, shall ye sing:</P>
