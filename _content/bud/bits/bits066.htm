<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the king, "Bhante N&acirc;gasena, how far is it hence to the Brahma-world?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your majesty, it is a long way hence to the Brahma-world. If a rock of the size of a pagoda were to fall thence, and descend forty-eight thousand leagues in a day and a night, it would reach the earth in four months' time."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante N&acirc;gasena, you priests say as follows: 'As quickly as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm, or might bend his stretched-out arm, even so a priest who possesses magical power and has obtained the mastery over his mind, can disappear from the continent of India and reappear in the Brahma-world,' This I cannot believe, that he should go so very quickly so many hundreds of leagues."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the elder, "Your majesty, in what country were you born?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante, there is an island named Alexandria, and there was I born."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your majesty, how far is it hence to Alexandria?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante, it is about two hundred leagues."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call to mind, your majesty, something you may have done there."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, bhante, I am doing so."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your majesty, you have gone those two hundred leagues very nimbly."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an able man, bhante N&acirc;gasena."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the king, "Bhante N&acirc;gasena, if two men were to die here, and one of them were to be reborn in the Brahma-world and the other in Cashmere, which would arrive first?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your majesty, they would take the same length of time."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give an illustration."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your majesty, in what city were you born?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante, there is a town called Kalasi, and there was I born."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your majesty, how far is it hence to the town of Kalasi?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante, it is about two hundred leagues."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your majesty, how far is it hence to Cashmere?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante, it is twelve leagues."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be so good, your majesty, as to think of the town of Kalasi."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante, I have thought of it."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your majesty, be so good as to think of Cashmere."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante, I have thought of it."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your majesty, which took the longer to think of?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante, it took the same length of time."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In exactly the same way, your majesty, if two men were to die here, and one of them were to be reborn in the Brahma-world and the other in Cashmere, it would take them the same length of time."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give another illustration."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say to this, your majesty? Two birds are flying through the air; one settles on a high tree, and the second on a low one. If now they have alighted at the same time, which one's shadow will first reach the ground?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bhante, both shadows will reach the ground at the same time."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In exactly the same way, your majesty, if two men were to die here, and one of them were to be reborn in the Brahma-world and the other in Cashmere, it would take them the same length of time."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are an able man, bhante N&acirc;gasena."</P>
