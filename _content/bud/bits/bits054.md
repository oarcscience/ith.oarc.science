§ 54. FRIENDSHIP.

{The Sâketa Birth-Story}

<span class="small">Translated from the Jâtaka (i.308<sup>24</sup>), and
constituting Birth-Story 68.</span>

   "*On whom the heart instinctive rests*." This was related by The
Teacher while dwelling in Añjana Wood, which is in the vicinity of
Sâketa; and it was concerning a certain Brahman.

   It appears that, as The Blessed One, surrounded by the congregation
of the priests, was about to enter Añjana Wood, which is in the vicinity
of Sâketa, a certain aged Brahman, a citizen of Sâketa, came out from
that city and saw The One Possessing the Ten Forces in the gate-way.
Falling at his feet, the Brahman seized him firmly by the ankles, and
said,

   "O my dear boy! Should not parents in their old age be taken care of
by their sons? Why, in all this long time, have you not shown yourself
to us? And now that I have seen you, come and let your mother see you
also." And with that he took The Teacher home with him.

   When The Teacher arrived there, he sat down with the

congregation of the priests, taking the seat that was spread for him.

   Then came also the Brahman's wife, and fell at The Teacher's feet.

   "O my dear boy!" said she, weeping. "Where have you been gone so
long? Should you not have paid your respects to your aged father and
mother?" And she made her sons and her daughters do him obeisance,
saying, "Come, do obeisance to your brother."

   The Brahman and his wife, in great delight, gave a liberal repast,
and at the close of breakfast, The Teacher preached to these two persons
the Discourse on Old Age. At the close of the discourse, both the
Brahman and his wife had become established in the fruit of never
returning. The Teacher then rose from his seat, and returned to Añjana
Wood.

   And it came to pass, that when the priests were convened in the
lecture-hall, they raised a discussion:

   "Brethren, the Brahman knows the father of The Tathâgata to be
Suddhodana, and his mother Mahâ-Mâyâ. Notwithstanding, both he and his
wife call The Tathâgata their son, and The Teacher consents to it. What
now is the reason?"

   When The Teacher heard their discussion, he said,

   "Priests, they call me son who am their son." So saying, he related
the occurrences of by-gone existences:--

 

   "Priests, in past time this Brahman was for five hundred successive
existences my father, and for five hundred successive existences my
uncle, and for five hundred successive existences my grandfather. And
also this Brahman's wife was for five hundred successive existences my
mother, and for five hundred successive existences my aunt, and for five
hundred successive existences my grandmother. Thus for fifteen hundred
existences was I brought up by this Brahman, and for fifteen hundred
existences was I brought up by this Brahman's wife."

   Thus did The Buddha tell of three thousand existences, and then
pronounced the following stanza:

|                                   |                                                    |

*On whom the heart instinctive rests*:--On whatever individual the mind
rests securely at first sight.

*In whom the spirit finds delight*:--In whom the spirit delights, for
whom it feels tenderness, at first sight.

*With him, though one ne'er seen before*:--Strictly speaking, one never
seen before in this present existence.

*Safely in friendship one may dwell*:--On account of previous friendship
one may have thorough confidence in that individual: in other words,
that is the reason one does have confidence in him.

 

When The Teacher had given this doctrinal instruction, and had applied
the moral to the story, he identified the characters of the Birth-Story:

"In those existences the Brahman and the Brahman's wife were the Brahman
and the Brahman woman of this existence; the son was I myself."
