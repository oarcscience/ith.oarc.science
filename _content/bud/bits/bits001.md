END OF THE STORY OF SUMEDHA.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Next: § 2. A List of Former Buddhas](bits002)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_5">p. 5</span>

<span id="page_5_note_1"></span>[1](#page_5_fr_1) This entire story is
related by The Buddha to his disciples, and describes how, in his
long-ago existence as the Brahman Sumedha, he first resolved to strive
for the Buddhaship. In stanzas 12-16 he speaks of himself, that is, of
Sumedha, in the third person, but elsewhere in the first.

<span id="page_5_note_2"></span>[2](#page_5_fr_2) Only six of the ten
noises indicative of a flourishing town are here mentioned. For the
complete list, see [p. 101](bits012.htm#page_101).

<span id="page_5_note_3"></span>[3](#page_5_fr_3) Probably gold, silver,
pearls, gems (such as sapphire and ruby), cat's-eye, diamond, and coral;
or perhaps as given on [p. 101, note](bits012.htm#page_101_note_1).

<span id="footnotes_page_6">p. 6</span>

<span id="page_6_note_1"></span>[1](#page_6_fr_1) Lust, hatred, and
infatuation. Compare [page 59](bits006.htm#page_59), and also the
"Fire-sermon," [page 351](bits073.htm#page_351).

<span id="footnotes_page_8">p. 8</span>

<span id="page_8_note_1"></span>[1](#page_8_fr_1) The two eyes, ears,
and so forth, as enumerated at [page 298](bits062.htm#page_298).

<span id="page_8_note_2"></span>[2](#page_8_fr_2) The Himalaya
mountains. *Himâlaya* and *Himavant* are Sanskrit words of almost
identical signification. The former means "snow-abode," and is a
compound of *hima*, "snow," and *âlaya*, "settling-down place," or
"abode." *Hima-vant* means "snow-y."

<span id="footnotes_page_9">p. 9</span>

<span id="page_9_note_1"></span>[1](#page_9_fr_1) Native gloss: Jâtaka,
vol. i., p. 7, l. 14: *Exempted from the five defects*: The following
are the five defects in a walking-place: hardness and unevenness; trees
in the midst; dense underbrush; excessive narrowness; excessive width.
For if the walking-place be on hard and uneven ground, then any one who
uses it hurts and blisters his feet, so that he fails of concentration
of mind, and his meditation is broken up; while he who walks at ease on
a soft and even surface succeeds in meditation. Therefore hardness and
unevenness of surface are to be reckoned as one defect. If a
walking-place have trees in it, whether in the middle or at the end,
then any one who uses it is liable, if not careful, to strike his
forehead or his head against them. Therefore trees in the midst are a
second defect. If a walking-place be overgrown with a dense underbrush
of grass, vines, and so forth, any one who uses it in the dark is liable
to tread upon snakes and other creatures and kill them, or they may bite
and injure him. Thus a dense underbrush is a third defect. If a
walking-place be excessively narrow, say only a cubit or half a cubit
wide, then any one who uses it is liable to stumble at the borders and
stub his toes and break his toe-nails. Therefore excessive narrowness is
a fourth defect. If a walking-place be excessively wide, then any one
who uses it is liable to have his mind wander and fail of concentration.
Thus excessive width is a fifth defect. A walking-place should be a path
a cubit and a half in breadth, with a margin of a cubit on either side,
and it should be sixty cubits in length, and it should have a surface
soft and evenly sprinkled with sand.

<span id="page_9_note_2"></span>[2](#page_9_fr_2) Ibidem, l. 30. *And
having all the virtues eight*: Having the eight advantages for a monk.
The following are the eight advantages for a monk: it admits of no
storing-up of treasure or grain; it favors only a blameless
alms-seeking; there one can eat his alms in peace and quiet; there no
annoyance is experienced from the reigning families when they oppress
the kingdom with their levies of the precious metals or of leaden money;
no passionate desire arises for furniture and implements; there is no
fear of being plundered by robbers; no intimacies are formed with kings
and courtiers; and one is not shut in in any of the four directions.

<span id="page_9_note_3"></span>[3](#page_9_fr_3) Native gloss: Jâtaka,
vol. i., p. 8, l. 27: *For cloaks possess the nine defects*: . . . For
one who retires from the world and takes up the life of an anchorite,
there are nine defects inherent in garments of cloth. The great cost is
one defect; the fact that it is got by dependence on others is another;
the fact that it is easily soiled by use is another, for when it has
been soiled it must be washed and dyed; the fact that when it is much
worn it must needs be patched and mended is another; the difficulty of
obtaining a new one when needed is another; its unsuitableness for an
anchorite who has retired from the world is another; its acceptableness
to one's enemies is another, for it must needs be guarded lest the enemy
take it; the danger that it may be worn for ornament is another; the
temptation it affords to load one's self down with it in travelling is
another.

<span id="footnotes_page_10">p. 10</span>

<span id="page_10_note_1"></span>[1](#page_10_fr_1) The bast, or inner
bark of certain trees, was much used in India as cloth, to which indeed
it bears a striking resemblance.--Native gloss: Jâtaka, vol. i., p. 9,
l. 2: *Which is with virtues twelve endued*: Possessing twelve
advantages. For there are twelve advantages in a dress of bark. It is
cheap, good, and suitable; this is one advantage. You can make it
yourself; this is a second. It gets dirty but slowly by use, and hence
time is not wasted in washing it; this is a third. It never needs
sewing, even when much used and worn; this is a fourth. But when a new
one is needed, it can be made with ease; this is a fifth. Its
suitableness for an anchorite who has retired from the world is a sixth.
That it is of no use to one's enemies is a seventh. That it cannot be
worn for ornament is an eighth. Its lightness is a ninth. Its conducing
to moderation in dress is a tenth. The irreproachableness and
blamelessness of searching for bark is an eleventh. And the unimportance
of its loss is a twelfth.

<span id="page_10_note_2"></span>[2](#page_10_fr_2) Native gloss:
Jâtaka, vol. i., p. 9, l.11: *My hut of leaves I then forsook, So
crowded with the eight defects*: ...(L. 36) For there are eight evils
connected with the use of a leaf-hut. The great labor involved in
searching for materials and in the putting of them together is one evil.
The constant care necessary to replace the grass, leaves, and bits of
clay that fall down is a second. Houses may do for old men, but no
concentration of mind is possible when one's meditation is liable to be
interrupted; thus the liability to interruption is a third. The
protection afforded against heat and cold renders the body delicate, and
this is a fourth. In a house all sorts of evil deeds are possible; thus
the cover it affords for disgraceful practices is a fifth. The taking
possession, saying, "This is mine," is a sixth. To have a house is like
having a companion; this is a seventh. And the sharing of it with many
others, as for instance with lice, bugs, and house-lizards, is an
eighth.

<span id="page_10_note_3"></span>[3](#page_10_fr_3) Ibidem, p. 10, l. 9:
*And at the foot of trees I lived, For such abodes have virtues ten*:
...The following are the ten virtues. The smallness of the undertaking
is one virtue, for all that is necessary is simply to go to the tree.
The small amount of care it requires is a second; for, whether swept or
unswept, it is suitable for use. The freedom from interruption is a
third. It affords no cover for disgraceful practices; wickedness there
would be too public; thus the fact that it affords no cover for
disgraceful practices is a fourth. It is like living under the open sky,
for there is no feeling that the body is confined; thus the
nonconfinement of the body is a fifth. There is no taking possession;
this is a sixth. The abandonment of all longings for household life is a
seventh. When a house is shared with others, some one is liable to
say,"I will look after this house myself. Begone!" Thus the freedom from
eviction is an eighth. The happy contentment experienced by the occupant
is a ninth. The little concern one need feel about lodgings, seeing that
a man can find a tree no matter where he may be stopping,--this is a
tenth.

<span id="footnotes_page_11">p. 11</span>

<span id="page_11_note_1"></span>[1](#page_11_fr_1) Translated from the
prose of the Jâtaka, vol. i., p. 10, last line but one: At his
\[Dîpamkara's\] conception, birth, attainment of Buddhaship, and when he
caused the Wheel of Doctrine to roll, the entire system of ten thousand
worlds trembled, quivered, and shook, and roared with a mighty roar;
also the Thirty-Two Prognostics appeared. \[For the Thirty-Two

Jâtaka, vol. i., p. 13, l. 31: As he lay in the mud, he opened his eyes
again, and gazing upon the Buddha-glory of Dîpamkara, The Possessor of
the Ten Forces, he reflected as follows: "If I so wished, I might burn
up all my corruptions, and as novice follow with the congregation when
they enter the city of Ramma; but I do not want to burn up my
corruptions and enter Nirvana unknown to any one. What now if I, like
Dîpamkara, were to acquire the supreme wisdom, were to cause multitudes
to go on board the ship of Doctrine and cross the ocean of the round of
rebirth, and were afterwards to pass into Nirvana! That would be
something worthy of me!"

Jâtaka, vol. i., p. 14, l. 20: For it is only a human being that can
successfully wish to be a Buddha; a serpent, or a bird, or a deity
cannot successfully make the wish. Of human beings it is only one of the
male sex that can make the wish: it would not be successful on the part
of a woman, or of a eunuch, or of a neuter, or of a hermaphrodite. Of
men it is he, and only he, who is in a fit condition by the attainment
of saintship in that same existence, that can successfully make the
wish. Of those in a fit condition it is only he who makes the wish in
the presence of a living Buddha that succeeds in his wish; after the
death of a Buddha a wish made at a relic-shrine, or at the foot of a
Bo-tree, will not be successful. Of those who make the wish in the
presence of a Buddha it is he, and only he, who has retired from the
world that can successfully make the wish, and not one who is a layman.
Of those who have retired from the world it is only he who is possessed
of the Five High Powers and is master of the Eight Attainments that can
successfully make the wish, and no one can do so who is lacking in these
excellences. Of those, even, who possess these excellences it is he, and
only he, who has such firm resolve that he is ready to sacrifice his
life for The Buddhas that can successfully make the wish, but no other.
Of those who possess this resolve it is he, and only he, who has great
zeal, determination, strenuousness, and endeavor in striving for the
qualities that make a Buddha that is successful. The following
comparisons will show the intensity of the zeal. If he is such a one as
to think: "The man who, if all within the rim of the world were to
become water, would be ready to swim across it with his own arms and get
to the further shore,--he is the one to attain the Buddhaship; or, in
case all within the rim of the world were to become a jungle of bamboo,
would be ready to elbow and trample his way through it and get to the
further side,--he is the one to attain the Buddhaship; or, in case all
within the rim of the world were to become a terra firma of thick-set
javelins, would be ready to tread on them and go afoot to the further
side,--he is the one to attain the Buddhaship; or, in case all within
the rim of the world were to become live coals, would be ready to tread
on them and so get to the further side,--he is the one to attain the
Buddhaship,"--if he deems not even one of these feats too hard for
himself, but has such great zeal, determination, strenuousness, and
power of endeavor that he would perform these feats in order to attain
the Buddhaship, then, but not otherwise, will his wish succeed.

beings who, like Sumedha here, were to become Buddhas, and who were
therefore called Bodhi-sattas or "Future Buddhas." The certainty of
their ultimate "Illumination," or Buddhaship, was always foretokened by
certain presages. The "dwellers of ten thousand worlds" describe in the
following stanzas what these presages were, declare that they are
reappearing now, and announce to Sumedha their prophetic inference that
he will attain Buddhaship.
