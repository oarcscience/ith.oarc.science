§ 89. CAN THE SAINT SUFFER?

<span class="small">Translated from the Samyutta-Nikâya
(xxii.1<sup>18</sup>).</span>

   "And how, O householder, is one wretched of body but not wretched of
mind?

   "We may have, O householder, a learned and noble disciple, who is a
follower of noble disciples, conversant with the Noble Doctrine,
disciplined in the Noble Doctrine, a follower of good people, conversant
with the Doctrine held by good people, disciplined in the Doctrine held
by good people. He does not consider form in the light of an
Ego--neither the Ego as possessing form, nor form as comprised in the
Ego, nor the Ego as comprised in form--and is thus not possessed with
the idea, 'I am form; form belongs to the I.' And not being possessed
with the idea, 'I am form; form belongs to the I,' when form alters and
changes, the alteration and change of form do not cause sorrow,
lamentation, grief, and despair to arise in him.

   "He does not consider sensation . . . perception . . . the
predispositions . . . consciousness in the light of an Ego-- neither the
Ego as possessing consciousness, nor consciousness as comprised in the
Ego, nor the Ego as comprised in consciousness--and is thus not
possessed with the idea, 'I am consciousness; consciousness belongs to
the I.' And not being possessed with the idea, 'I am consciousness;
consciousness belongs to the I,' when consciousness alters and changes,
the alteration and change of consciousness do not cause sorrow,
lamentation, grief, and despair to arise in him.

   "Thus, O householder, is one wretched of body but not wretched of
mind."

   Thus spake the venerable Sâriputta, and the delighted householder
Nakulapitâ applauded the speech of the venerable Sâriputta.
