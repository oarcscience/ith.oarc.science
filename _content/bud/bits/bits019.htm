<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<I>What he sees he does not wish for.</I>" This was related by The Teacher while dwelling in Jetavana monastery, and it was concerning a certain wandering ascetic who ran away.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems this ascetic had not found any one throughout the whole continent of India to refute his propositions; and coming to S&acirc;vatthi, he inquired, "Who is able to debate with me?" On hearing it said, "The Supreme Buddha is able," he went to Jetavana monastery, surrounded by a crowd of people. There he saw The Blessed One in the midst of the four classes of his disciples teaching them the Doctrine; and he propounded to him his questions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then The Teacher answered him, and in return asked, "What constitutes a unit?" And he, being unable to reply, rose up and ran away.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they of the assembly said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reverend Sir, you silenced the wandering ascetic with the question concerning the unit."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said The Teacher,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not now for the first time, O lay disciples, have I silenced him with the question concerning the unit; formerly also did I do so."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, he related the by-gone occurrence:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was ruling at Benares, the Future Buddha was born in the family of a Brahman of that kingdom. When he was come of age, he renounced pleasures and adopted the life of a holy recluse, and dwelt for a long time in the Himalaya Mountains. And descending from the hills, he made his abode in a leaf-hut close by a market-village, at a bend of the Ganges.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a certain wandering ascetic who had not found any one throughout the whole continent of India to refute his propositions,</P>

<P>came to that market-village, and inquired, "Is there any one here able to debate with me?" And hearing that the Future Buddha was able, he went to his dwelling-place, surrounded by a crowd of people, and greeting him politely, sat down.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Future Buddha said to him,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will you have a drink of Ganges water, fragrant with the scent of the forest?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon the wandering ascetic began volubly to debate, saying,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the Ganges? Is the sand the Ganges? Is the water the Ganges? Is the hither bank the Ganges? Is the further bank the Ganges?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Future Buddha said to him,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you except the water, the sand, the hither bank, and the further bank, where can you find any Ganges?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wandering ascetic was confounded, and rose up and ran away.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was gone, the Future Buddha began teaching the Doctrine to the assembly that was seated about, and spoke</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the following stanzas:--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here:-</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>What he sees</I>:- The water etc. which he sees, he does not wish to regard as the Ganges.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>But something that he does not see</I>:--But he wishes for a Ganges he does not see, for one abstracted from water etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Methinks that he will wander long</I>:--Methinks thus: "This wandering ascetic, in his search for such a Ganges, will wander long; or if, in</P>

<P>the same manner as for this Ganges abstracted from water etc., he is in search of an Ego abstracted from form etc., he will wander a long time in the round of rebirth."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>And what he wishes, not obtain</I>:--Although he wander a long time, he will not find such a Ganges or Ego as he is looking for.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>What he gets</I>:--He is not pleased with the water, or the form etc., which he gets.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>No sooner gained, it meets his scorn</I>:--Being thus not pleased with what he gets, any longed-for success which he gains, this he scorns and despises, saying, "What do I care for this?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Insatiate are wishes all</I>: -Wish or desire is insatiate, as it continually seeks for a fresh object which it scorns as soon as obtained.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The wish-free, therefore, we adore</I>:--Therefore we adore The Buddhas and all others who are free from wishes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When The Teacher had given this instruction, he identified the characters in the Birth-Story: "The wandering ascetic of that existence was the wandering ascetic of this. The anchorite was I myself."</P>
