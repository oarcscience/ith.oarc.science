§ 91. HEAVEN NOT THE HIGHEST GOOD.

<span class="small">Translated from the Anguttara-Nikâya
(iii.18).</span>

   "If wandering ascetics, O priests, members of another sect, were to
say to you, 'Sirs, is it in order to be reborn in the world of the gods
that the monk Gotama leads a holy life?' would ye not, O priests, if
that question were put to you, be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe
the idea?"

   "Yes, Reverend Sir."

   "So it appears, O priests, that ye are distressed at, ashamed of, and
loathe the idea of life in heaven, heavenly beauty, heavenly happiness,
heavenly glory; that ye are distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe the
idea of heavenly power. But much more, O priests, should ye be
distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the body; be
distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the voice; be
distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the mind."
