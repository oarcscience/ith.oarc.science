§ 92. THE SAINTS SUPERIOR TO THE GODS.

<span class="small">Translated from the Anguttara-Nikâya
(iii.37).</span>

   In former times, O priests, Sakka, the leader of the gods, was
admonishing the Gods of the Suite of the Thirty-three, and on that
occasion pronounced the following stanza:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Come, tell me, where's the man like me,<br />
The fourteenth day, the fifteenth day,<br />
And eke the eighth of each half-month,<br />
To celebrate as days of fast,<br />
And keep the vows, in number eight,<br />
Through all the months of residence!"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   Now this stanza, O priests, which was sung by Sakka, the leader of
the gods, was inapposite, not apposite, ill-spoken, not well-spoken. And
why do I say so? Because Sakka, the leader

|                                   |                                       |

of the gods, O priests, was not free from passion, was not free from
hatred, was not free from infatuation. But that priest, O priests, who
is a saint, who has lost all depravity, who has led the holy life, who
has done what it behooved him to do, who has laid aside the burden, who
has achieved the supreme good, who has destroyed every fetter that binds
him to existence, who is released by perfect knowledge, such a priest, O
priests, can truly say,

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Come, tell me where 's the man like me,<br />
The fourteenth day, the fifteenth day,<br />
And eke the eighth of each half-month,<br />
To celebrate as days of fast,<br />
And keep the vows, in number eight,<br />
Through all the months of residence!"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

passion, is free from hatred, is free from infatuation.

the gods, was inapposite, not apposite, ill-spoken, not well-spoken. And
why do I say so? Because Sakka, the leader of the gods, O priests, is
not released from birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery,
grief, and despair; in short, he is not released from misery. But that
priest, O priests, who is a saint, who has lost all depravity, who has
led the holy life, who has done what it behooved him to do, who has laid
aside the burden, who has achieved the supreme good, who has destroyed

in short, he is released from misery.
