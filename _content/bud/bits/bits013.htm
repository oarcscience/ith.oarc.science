<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus have I heard.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at S&acirc;vatthi in Jetavana monastery in An&acirc;thapindika's Park. Now it happened to the venerable M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, being in seclusion and plunged in meditation, that a consideration presented itself to his mind, as follows:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These theories which The Blessed One has left unelucidated, has set aside and rejected,--that the world is eternal, that the world is not eternal, that the world is finite, that the world is infinite, that the soul and the body are identical, that the soul is one thing and the body another, that the saint exists after death, that the saint does not exist after death, that the saint both exists and does not exist after death, that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death,--these The Blessed One does not elucidate to me. And the fact that The Blessed One does not elucidate them to me does not please me nor suit me. Therefore I will draw near to The Blessed One and inquire of him concerning this matter. If The Blessed One will elucidate to me, either that the world is eternal, or that the world is not eternal, or that the world is finite, or that the world is infinite, or that the soul and the body are identical, or that the soul is one thing and the body another, or that the saint exists after death, or that the saint does not exist after death, or that the saint both exists and does not exist after death, or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, in that case will I lead the religious life under The Blessed One. If The Blessed One will not elucidate to me, either that the world is eternal, or that the world is not eternal, . . . or that the saint neither exists</P>

<P>nor does not exist after death, in that case will I abandon religious training and return to the lower life of a layman."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the venerable M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta arose at eventide from his seclusion, and drew near to where The Blessed One was; and having drawn near and greeted The Blessed One, he sat down respectfully at one side. And seated respectfully at one side, the venerable M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta spoke to The Blessed One as follows:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reverend Sir, it happened to me, as I was just now in seclusion and plunged in meditation, that a consideration presented itself to my mind, as follows: 'These theories which The Blessed One has left unelucidated, has set aside and rejected,--that the world is eternal, that the world is not eternal, . . . that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death,--these The Blessed One does not elucidate to me. And the fact that The Blessed One does not elucidate them to me does not please me nor suit me. I will draw near to The Blessed One and inquire of him concerning this matter. If The Blessed One will elucidate to me, either that the world is eternal, or that the world is not eternal, . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, in that case will I lead the religious life under The Blessed One. If The Blessed One will not elucidate to me, either that the world is eternal, or that the world is not eternal, . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, in that case will I abandon religious training and return to the lower life of a layman.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If The Blessed One knows that the world is eternal, let The Blessed One elucidate to me that the world is eternal; if The Blessed One knows that the world is not eternal, let The Blessed One elucidate to me that the world is not eternal. If The Blessed One does not know either that the world is eternal or that the world is not eternal, the only upright thing for one who does not know, or who has not that insight, is to say, 'I do not know; I have not that insight.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If The Blessed One knows that the world is finite, . . .'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If The Blessed One knows that the soul and the body are identical, . . .'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If The Blessed One knows that the saint both exists and does not exist after death, let The Blessed One elucidate to me that the saint both exists and does not exist after death; if The Blessed One knows that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, let The Blessed One elucidate to me that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death. If The Blessed One does not know either that the saint both exists and does not exist after death, or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, the only upright thing for one who does not know, or who has not that insight, is to say, 'I do not know; I have not that insight.'"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, did I ever say to you, 'Come, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, lead the religious life under me, and I will elucidate to you either that the world is eternal, or that the world is not eternal, . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death'?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, verily, Reverend Sir."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or did you ever say to me, 'Reverend Sir, I will lead the religious life under The Blessed One, on condition that The Blessed One elucidate to me either that the world is eternal, or that the world is not eternal, . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death'?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, verily, Reverend Sir."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you acknowledge, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, that I have not said to you, 'Come, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, lead the religious life under me and I will elucidate to you either that the world is eternal, or that the world is not eternal, . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death;' and again that you have not said to me, 'Reverend Sir, I will lead the religious life under The Blessed One, on condition that The Blessed One elucidate to me either that the world is eternal, or that the world is not eternal, . . . or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is as if, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, a man had been wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with poison, and his friends and companions, his relatives and kinsfolk, were to procure for him a physician or surgeon; and the sick man were to say, 'I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the man who wounded me belonged to the warrior caste, or to the Brahman caste, or to the agricultural caste, or to the menial caste.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or again he were to say, 'I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the bow which wounded me was a c&acirc;pa, or a kodannda.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or again he were to say, 'I will not have this arrow taken out until I have learnt whether the bow-string which wounded me was made from swallow-wort, or bamboo, or sinew, or maruva, or from milk-weed.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The religious life, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, does not depend on the dogma that the world is eternal; nor does the religious life, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, depend on the dogma that the world is not eternal.

<P>saint both exists and does not exist after death, or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, there still remain birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair, for the extinction of which in the present life I am prescribing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accordingly, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, bear always in mind what it is that I have not elucidated, and what it is that I have elucidated. And what, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, have I not elucidated? I have not elucidated, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, that the world is eternal; I have not elucidated that the world is not eternal; I have not elucidated that the world is finite; I have not elucidated that the world is infinite; I have not elucidated that the soul and the body are identical; I have not elucidated that the soul is one thing and the body another; I have not elucidated that the saint exists after death; I have not elucidated that the saint does not exist after death; I have not elucidated that the saint both exists and does not exist after death; I have not elucidated that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death. And why, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, have I not elucidated this? Because, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, this profits not, nor has to do with the fundamentals of religion, nor tends to aversion, absence of passion, cessation, quiescence, the supernatural faculties, supreme wisdom, and Nirvana; therefore have I not elucidated it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And what, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, have I elucidated? Misery, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, have I elucidated; the origin of misery have I elucidated; the cessation of misery have I elucidated; and the path leading to the cessation of misery have I elucidated. And why, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, have I elucidated this? Because, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, this does profit, has to do with the fundamentals of religion, and tends to aversion, absence of passion, cessation, quiescence, knowledge, supreme wisdom, and Nirvana; therefore have I elucidated it. Accordingly, M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta, bear always in mind what it is that I have not elucidated, and what it is that I have elucidated."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus spake The Blessed One; and, delighted, the venerable M&acirc;lunky&acirc;putta applauded the speech of The Blessed One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus have I heard.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a certain occasion The Blessed One was dwelling at S&acirc;vatthi in Jetavana monastery in An&acirc;thapindika's Park. Then drew near Vaccha, the wandering ascetic, to where The Blessed One was; and having drawn near, he greeted The Blessed One; and having passed the compliments of friendship and civility, he sat down respectfully at one side. And seated respectfully at one side, Vaccha, the wandering ascetic, spoke to The Blessed One as follows:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it, Gotama? Does Gotama hold that the world is eternal, and that this view alone is true, and every other false?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, Vaccha. I do not hold that the world is eternal, and that this view alone is true, and every other false."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But how is it, Gotama? Does Gotama hold that the world is not eternal, and that this view alone is true, and every other false?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, Vaccha. I do not hold that the world is not eternal, and that this view alone is true, and every other false."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it, Gotama? Does Gotama hold that the world is finite, . . ."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it, Gotama? Does Gotama hold that the soul and the body are identical, . . ."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it, Gotama? Does Gotama hold that the saint exists after death, . . ."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it, Gotama? Does Gotama hold that the saint both exists and does not exist after death, and that this view alone is true, and every other false?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, Vaccha. I do not hold that the saint both exists and does not exist after death, and that this view alone is true, and every other false."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But how is it, Gotama? Does Gotama hold that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, and that this view alone is true, and every other false?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, Vaccha. I do not hold that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, and that this view alone is true, and every other false."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it, Gotama, that when you are asked, 'Does the monk Gotama hold that the world is eternal, and that this view alone is true, and every other false?' you reply, 'Nay, Vaccha. I do not hold that the world is eternal, and that this view alone is true, and every other false'?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But how is it, Gotama, that when you are asked, 'Does the monk Gotama hold that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, and that this view alone is true, and every other false?' you reply, 'Nay, Vaccha. I do not hold that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, and that this view alone is true, and every other false'? What objection does Gotama perceive to these theories that he has not adopted any one of them?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vaccha, the theory that the world is eternal, is a jungle, a wilderness, a puppet-show, a writhing, and a fetter, and is coupled with misery, ruin, despair, and agony, and does not tend to aversion, absence of passion, cessation, quiescence, knowledge, supreme wisdom, and Nirvana.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vaccha, the theory that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death, is a jungle, a wilderness, a puppet-show, a writhing, and a fetter, and is coupled with misery, ruin, despair, and agony, and does not tend to aversion, absence of passion, cessation, quiescence, knowledge, supreme wisdom, and Nirvana.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the objection I perceive to these theories, so that I have not adopted any one of them."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But has Gotama any theory of his own?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Tath&acirc;gata, O Vaccha, is free from all theories; but this, Vaccha, does The Tath&acirc;gata know,--the nature of form, and how form arises, and how form perishes; the nature of sensation, and how sensation arises, and how sensation perishes; the nature of perception, and how perception arises, and how perception perishes; the nature of the predispositions, and how the predispositions arise, and how the predispositions perish; the nature of consciousness, and how consciousness arises, and how consciousness perishes. Therefore say I that The Tath&acirc;gata has attained deliverance and is free from attachment, inasmuch as all imaginings, or agitations, or proud thoughts concerning an Ego or anything pertaining to an Ego, have perished, have faded away, have ceased, have been given up and relinquished."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, Gotama, where is the priest reborn who has attained to this deliverance for his mind?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vaccha, to say that he is reborn would not fit the case."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, Gotama, he is not reborn."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vaccha, to say that he is not reborn would not fit the case."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, Gotama, he is both reborn and is not reborn."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vaccha, to say that he is both reborn and not reborn would not fit the case."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, Gotama, he is neither reborn nor not reborn."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vaccha, to say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I say to you, 'But, Gotama, where is the priest reborn who has attained to this deliverance for his mind?' you reply, 'Vaccha, to say that he is reborn would not fit</P>

<P>the case.' And when I say to you, 'Then, Gotama, he is not reborn,' you reply, 'Vaccha, to say that he is not reborn would not fit the case.' And when I say to you, 'Then, Gotama, he is both reborn and not reborn,' you reply, 'Vaccha, to say that he is both reborn and not reborn would not fit the case.' And when I say to you, 'Then, Gotama, he is neither reborn nor not reborn,' you reply, 'Vaccha, to say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case.' Gotama, I am at a loss what to think in this matter, and I have become greatly confused, and the faith in Gotama inspired by a former conversation has now disappeared."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough, O Vaccha! Be not at a loss what to think in this matter, and be not greatly confused. Profound, O Vaccha, is this doctrine, recondite, and difficult of comprehension, good, excellent, and not to be reached by mere reasoning, subtile, and intelligible only to the wise; and it is a hard doctrine for you to learn, who belong to another sect, to another faith, to another persuasion, to another discipline, and sit at the feet of another teacher. Therefore, Vaccha, I will now question you, and do you make answer as may seem to you good. What think you, Vaccha? Suppose a fire were to burn in front of you, would you be aware that the fire was burning in front of you?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gotama, if a fire were to burn in front of me, I should be aware that a fire was burning in front of me."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But suppose, Vaccha, some one were to ask you, 'On what does this fire that is burning in front of you depend?' what would you answer, Vaccha?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gotama, if some one were to ask me, 'On what does this fire that is burning in front of you depend?' I would answer, Gotama, 'It is on fuel of grass and wood that this fire that is burning in front of me depends.'"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, Vaccha, if the fire in front of you were to become extinct, would you be aware that the fire in front of you had become extinct?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gotama, if the fire in front of me were to become extinct, I should be aware that the fire in front of me had become extinct."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, Vaccha, if some one were to ask you, 'In which direction has that fire gone,--east, or west, or north, or south?' what would you say, O Vaccha?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The question would not fit the case, Gotama. For the fire which depended on fuel of grass and wood, when that fuel has all gone, and it can get no other, being thus without nutriment, is said to be extinct."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In exactly the same way, Vaccha, all form by which one could predicate the existence of the saint, all that form has been abandoned, uprooted, pulled out of the ground like a palmyra-tree, and become non-existent and not liable to spring up again in the future. The saint, O Vaccha, who has been released from what is styled form, is deep, immeasurable, unfathomable, like the mighty ocean. To say that he is reborn would not fit the case. To say that he is not reborn would not fit the case. To say that he is both reborn and not reborn would not fit the case. To say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case.</P>

The saint, O Vaccha, who has been released from what is styled consciousness, is deep, immeasurable, unfathomable, like the mighty ocean. To say that he is reborn would not fit the case. To say that he is not reborn would not fit the case. To say that he is both reborn and not reborn would not fit the case. To say that he is neither reborn nor not reborn would not fit the case."</P>
