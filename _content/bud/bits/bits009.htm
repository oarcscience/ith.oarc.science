<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then The Blessed One, during the first watch of the night, thought over Dependent Origination both forward and back:--</P>

<P>Thus does this entire aggregation of misery arise.

Thus does this entire aggregation of misery cease.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then The Blessed One, during the last watch of the night, thought over Dependent Origination both forward and back:--On ignorance depends karma. . . .

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then The Blessed One, after the lapse of seven days, arose from that state of exalted calm, and leaving the foot of the Bo-tree, drew near to where the Ajap&acirc;la (that is, the Goatherd's) banyan-tree was; and having drawn near, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the Ajap&acirc;la banyan-tree for seven days together, experiencing the bliss of emancipation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a certain Brahman, who was of a proud and contemptuous disposition, drew near to where The Blessed One</P>

<P>was; and having drawn near, he exchanged greetings with The Blessed One. And having passed with him the greetings of friendship and civility, he stood respectfully at one side. And standing respectfully at one side, the Brahman spoke to The Blessed One as follows:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gotama, what is it constitutes a Brahman? and what are the Brahman-making qualities?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then The Blessed One, concerning this, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>"The Brahman who his evil traits hath banished,<BR>
Is free from pride, is self-restrained and spotless,<BR>
Is learned, and the holy life hath followed,<BR>

With things of earth he hath no point of contact."<BR></TD></TR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then The Blessed One, after the lapse of seven days, arose from that state of exalted calm, and leaving the foot of the Ajap&acirc;la banyan-tree, drew near to where the Mucalinda tree was; and having drawn near, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the Mucalinda tree for seven days together, experiencing the bliss of emancipation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time a great cloud appeared out of season, and for seven days it was rainy, cloudy weather, with a cold wind. Then issued Mucalinda, the serpent-king, from his abode, and enveloping the body of The Blessed One seven times with his folds, spread his great hood above his head, saying,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let neither cold nor heat, nor gnats, flies, wind, sunshine, nor creeping creatures come near The Blessed One!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, when seven days had elapsed, and Mucalinda, the serpent-king, knew that the storm had broken up, and that the clouds had gone, he unwound his coils from the body of The Blessed One. And changing his natural appearance into that of a young man, he stood before The Blessed One, and with his joined hands to his forehead did reverence to The Blessed One.</P>
