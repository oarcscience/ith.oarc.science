§ 72. MÂRA AS PLOWMAN.

<span class="small">Translated from the Samyutta-Nikâya (iv.2.9).</span>

   Scene: Sâvatthi.

   Now at that time The Blessed One enlightened, incited, quickened, and
gladdened the priests by a sermon on Nirvana. And the priests, listening
to the discourse with attentive ears, became convinced, stored it up in
their thoughts, and seized upon it with their whole minds.

   Then it occurred to Mâra, the Wicked One, as follows:

   "This monk Gotama enlightens, incites, quickens, and gladdens the
priests by a sermon on Nirvana. And the priests, listening to the
discourse with attentive ears, become convinced, store it up in their
thoughts, and seize upon it with their whole minds. What if now I draw
near to where the monk Gotama is in order to perplex him."

   Then Mâra, the Wicked One, assumed the appearance of

a plowman. He shouldered an immense plow, took a long goad in his hand,
and with dishevelled hair, a tunic of coarse hempen cloth, and
mud-stained feet, he drew near to where The Blessed One was. And having
drawn near, he spoke to The Blessed One as follows:

   "Monk, didst thou see any oxen?"

   "What, O Wicked One, hast thou to do with oxen?"

   "Mine, O monk, is the eye; mine are forms; mine is the sense of
sight. Where, O monk, canst thou go to escape from me?

   "Mine, O monk, is the ear; mine are sounds; mine is the sense of
hearing. Where, O monk, canst thou go to escape from me?

   "Mine, O monk, is the nose; mine are odors; mine is the sense of
smell. Where, O monk, canst thou go to escape from me?

   "Mine, O monk, is the tongue; mine are tastes; mine is the sense of
taste. Where, O monk, canst thou go to escape from me?

   "Mine, O monk, is the body; mine are things tangible; mine is the
sense of touch. Where, O monk, canst thou go to escape from me?

   "Mine, O monk, is the mind; mine are ideas; mine is the thinking
faculty. Where, O monk, canst thou go to escape from me?"

   "Thine, O Wicked One, is the eye; thine are forms; thine is the sense
of sight. But where, O Wicked One, there is no eye, nor any forms, nor
sense of sight, there, O Wicked One, thou canst not come.

   "Thine, O Wicked One, is the ear; thine are sounds; thine is the
sense of hearing. But where, O Wicked One, there is no ear, nor any
Bounds, nor sense of hearing, there, O Wicked One, thou canst not come.

   "Thine, O Wicked One, is the nose; thine are odors; thine is the
sense of smell. But where, O Wicked One, there is no nose, nor any
odors, nor sense of smell, there, O Wicked One, thou canst not come.

   "Thine, O Wicked One, is the tongue; thine are tastes;

|                                   |                                                    |

thine is the sense of taste. But where, O Wicked One, there is no
tongue, nor any tastes, nor sense of taste, there, O Wicked One, thou
canst not come.

   "Thine, O Wicked One, is the body; thine are things tangible; thine
is the sense of touch. But where, O Wicked One, there is no body, nor
anything tangible, nor sense of touch, there, O Wicked One, thou canst
not come.

   "Thine, O Wicked One, is the mind; thine are ideas; thine is the
thinking faculty. But where, O Wicked One, there is no mind, nor any
ideas, nor thinking faculty, there, O Wicked One, thou canst not come."

Of what 't is said, 'These are the I,'<br />

Then, monk, thou shalt not me escape."<br />

Not so with me; they're not the I;<br />

   Then said Mâra, the Wicked One:

   "The Blessed One has recognized me. The Happy One has recognized me,"
and sorrowful and dejected, he straightway disappeared.
