§ 76. NIRVANA TO BE ATTAINED AT DEATH.

<span class="small">Translated from the Visuddhi-Magga (chap.
xxii.).</span>

   Just as, however, a man displeased with the flowers, fruit, etc. of a
tree, will pierce it on each of its four sides with the poisonous thorn
called the mandu-thorn, and then that tree, when its earth-extracted
juices and its sap have become exhausted by the application of that
poison, will arrive at a state of inability to bear fruit and not be
able to reproduce itself; in exactly the same way a youth of good
family, displeased with the existence of the groups, will, like the man
who applied poison to the tree on each of its four sides, begin to apply
the meditation of the Four Paths to the series of his groups. And then
the series of his groups, when the rebirth-causing corruptions have
become exhausted by the application of the poison of the Four Paths,
resolves itself into such bodily and other kinds of karma as constitute
barren action;<span id="page_380_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_380_note_1) and arriving at a state
of not being liable to be reborn in the future, and unable to reproduce
itself in the next existence, by the cessation of the last consciousness
becomes like a fire without fuel, and passes into Nirvana without
attachment.
