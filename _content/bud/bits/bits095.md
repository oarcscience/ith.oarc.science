   "*What man his rising anger*." This doctrinal instruction was given
by The Teacher while dwelling in the Aggâlava shrine; and it was
concerning a certain priest.

   For when The Teacher had given permission to the congregation of the
priests to use houses, and houses were being built for them by the
Râjagaha treasurer and others, a certain priest who dwelt in the forest,
in making for himself a house, saw a particular tree, and began to cut
it down. But the goddess who had been born therein and had a young son,
took the child on her hip, and stood and begged, saying,

   "My lord, do not cut down my mansion. I cannot, with my little son,
wander about with no place of abode."

   "It would not be possible for me to find another tree like this,"
thought the priest, and heeded not her request.

   "At least, consideration for the child will cause him to stop,"
thought the goddess, and placed her son on a bough of the tree; but the
priest was unable to check his uplifted axe, and cut off the child's
arm.

   The goddess, in a violent rage, had lifted up both her hands to smite
the priest dead, when she thought,

   "This priest observes the precepts: if I kill him, I shall go to
hell. And the other goddesses, also, when they see their trees cut down
by priests, will follow my example, and kill the priests, thinking, 'It
was thus that such and such a goddess killed a priest.' But this priest
has a master: I will tell it to his master."

   Then she lowered her uplifted hands, and went weeping to The Teacher.
And having done him obeisance, she stood respectfully at one side.

   Then said The Teacher, "What is it, goddess?"

   "Reverend Sir," said she, "your disciple did so and so to me. I,
however, when desirous of killing him, made such and such a reflection,
and have come hither without killing him." And she related the whole
story in full.

   "Well done, well done, goddess!" said The Teacher, when he had heard
her story. "You did well in keeping your mounting anger under control,
as one would a chariot circling hither and thither." And he pronounced
this stanza:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"What man his rising anger curbs,<br />
Like chariot circling o'er the plain,<br />
He, truly, is the charioteer--<br />
Holders of reins all other folk."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   <span class="small">*Other folk*:--By "other folk" are meant the
charioteers of the king, of the deputy king, and so on. These are called
*holders of reins*, but not charioteers in the highest sense.</span>

   At the end of this instruction, the goddess became established in the
fruit of conversion; and the instruction was of profit also to the
assembled throng.

   But the goddess, though converted, continued to weep.

   Then said The Teacher, "What is it, goddess?"

   "Reverend Sir," said she, "my mansion is destroyed. What am I now to
do?"

   "Nay, goddess, be not anxious. I will give you a mansion." And
indicating a tree the goddess of which had passed into another existence
on the previous day, and which was situated in the neighborhood of the
perfumed chamber of Jetavana monastery, he said to her, "In such and
such a spot is a deserted tree; go thither."

   And she went thither; and from that time on, even powerful goddesses
did not dare to come and attempt to expel her from a tree that had been
given her by The Buddha.

   The Teacher, when he had performed this benefaction, laid down for
the priests the precept concerning vegetation.
