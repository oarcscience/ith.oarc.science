   "*Of such as these, in virtues rich*." This doctrinal instruction was
given by The Teacher while dwelling at Bamboo Grove in the vicinity of
Râjagaha; and it was concerning the attainment of Nirvana by Godhika the
elder.

   This venerable man, while dwelling at Black Rock on the slopes of
Isigili, being vigilant, austere, and strenuous, attained release for
his mind in ecstatic meditation, and then through the power of a disease
which beset him, the trance was broken up. A second time, a third time,
up to the sixth time was his trance broken up.

   At the seventh time, he thought,

   "Six times has my trance been broken up, and doubtful is the fate of
those who fail in trance. This time I will resort to the knife."

   And taking a razor for shaving the hair, he lay down on a couch in
order to cut his windpipe.

   Mâra, the Slayer, perceived his intention, and thought,

   "This priest is about to use the knife; but they who do so are
indifferent to life, and such attain to insight and saintship. If I
should attempt to dissuade him, he would not heed me. I will get The
Teacher to dissuade him."

   Then he disguised himself, and drawing near to The Teacher, he spoke
as follows:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Thou Hero Great, profoundly wise,<br />
Whose magic power full brightly shines,<br />
Who hast o'ercome all sin and fear,<br />
Thy feet I worship, Seeing One.<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

|                                   |                                                  |
|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_382">p. 382</span> | <span class="small">\[Dhp.255<sup>9</sup></span> |

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Thy follower, O thou Hero Great,<br />
Although o'er death victorious,<br />
Doth long for death, and plotteth it;<br />
Dissuade him, O thou Radiant One.<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even" data-valign="top">
<td>"Pray, shall thy follower, Blessed One,<br />
Whose keen delight is in thy law<br />
With goal unreached, not perfect trained,<br />
So soon expire, O Chief of Men?"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   At this instant the elder used the knife.

   The Teacher recognized the Slayer, and pronounced the following
stanza:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Thus, verily, the valiant act,<br />
Nor think to hanker after life!<br />
Lo! Godhika uproots desire,<br />
And, dying, has Nirvana gained."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   Then The Blessed One, with a great number of priests, went to the
place where the elder had lain down and used the knife.

   At that moment the Slayer, the Wicked One, had become a pillar of
smoke, as it were, or a bunch of darkness; and wondering to himself,
"Where can it have fixed itself?" was searching in all directions for
the elder's rebirth-consciousness.

   The Blessed One pointed out to the priests the smoke and darkness,
and said,

   "That, O priests, is the Slayer, the Wicked One. He is searching for
the consciousness of the noble Godhika, to find out where it has fixed
itself. But the noble Godhika, O priests, has attained Nirvana, and his
consciousness has not fixed itself."

   The Slayer, being unable to find out where the elder's consciousness
was, assumed the appearance of a youth with a lute of the white wood of
the bel-tree, and drawing near to The Teacher, he said,

   "Where has Godhika gone? Though I search upwards

|                                   |                                                   |
|:----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------:|
| <span id="page_383">p. 383</span> | <span class="small">\[Dhp.255<sup>28</sup></span> |

and downwards, and to all the points and intermediate points of the
compass, I do not meet him."

   Then said The Teacher to him,

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Always in meditation found<br />
That brave, strong man his best delight;<br />
Each day and night he practised it,<br />
And recked not, cared not, for his life.<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even" data-valign="top">
<td>"Thus vanquished he Namuci's host;<br />
No more to rebirth he returns.<br />
Lo! Godhika uproots desire,<br />
And, dying, has Nirvana gained."<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>The Demon sorely mortified,<br />
Down from his side let fall the lute;<br />
And in a sore, dejected mood,<br />
He straightway disappeared from sight.<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   And The Teacher said:

   "O Wicked One, what have you to do with the place of rebirth of the
noble Godhika? A hundred or a thousand such as you could never detect
his place of rebirth." So saying, he pronounced the stanza,

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Of such as these, in virtues rich,<br />
Of vigilant and sober lives,<br />
With minds by perfect knowledge freed,<br />
No track or path the Slayer finds."<br />
</td>
</tr>
