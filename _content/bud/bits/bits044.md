§ 44. THE ROUND OF EXISTENCE.

<span class="small">Translated from the Milindapañha
(77<sup>8</sup>).</span>

   "Bhante Nâgasena," said the king, "when you say 'round of existence,'
what is that?"

   "Your majesty, to be born here and die here, to die here and be born
elsewhere, to be born there and die there, to die there and be born
elsewhere,--this, your majesty, is the round of existence."

   "Give an illustration."

   "It is as if, your majesty, a man were to eat a ripe mango, and plant
the seed; and from that a large mango-tree were to spring and bear
fruit; and then the man were to eat a ripe mango from that tree also and
plant the seed; and from that seed also a large mango-tree were to
spring and bear fruit; thus of these trees there is no end discernible.
In exactly the same way, your majesty, to be born here and die here, to
die here and be born elsewhere, to be born there and die there, to die
there and be born elsewhere, this, your majesty, is the round of
existence."

   "You are an able man, bhante Nâgasena."
