§ 64. LOVE FOR ANIMALS.

\[SUBLIME STATE OF FRIENDLINESS.\]

<span class="small">Translated from the Culla-Vagga (v.6.).</span>

   Now at that time a certain priest had been killed by the bite of a
snake, and when they announced the matter to The Blessed One, he said:

   "Surely now, O priests, that priest never suffused the four royal
families of the snakes with his friendliness. For if, O priests, that
priest had suffused the four royal families of the snakes with his
friendliness, that priest, O priests, would not have been killed by the
bite of a snake. And what are the four royal families of the snakes? The
Virûpakkhas are a royal family of snakes; the Erâpathas are a royal
family of snakes; the Chabyâputtas are a royal family of snakes; the
Kanhâgotamakas are a royal family of snakes. Surely, now, O priests,
that priest did not suffuse the four royal families of the snakes with
his friendliness. For surely, O priests, if that priest had suffused the
four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness, that priest, O
priests, would not have been killed by the bite of a snake. I enjoin, O
priests, that ye suffuse these four royal families of the snakes with
your friendliness; and that ye sing a song of defence for your
protection and safeguard. After this manner, O priests, shall ye sing:

   "'Infinite is The Buddha, infinite the Doctrine, infinite the Order!
Finite are creeping things: snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders,
lizards, and mice! I have now made my protection, and sung my song of
defence. Let all living beings retreat! I revere The Blessed One, and
the seven Supreme Buddhas!'"
