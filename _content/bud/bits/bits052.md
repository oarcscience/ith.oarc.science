§ 52. THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN.

{The Lion's-skin Birth-Story.}

<span class="small">Translated from the Jâtaka (ii.109<sup>17</sup>),
and constituting Birth-Story 189.</span>

   "*Nay, this is not a lion's roar.*" This also was related by The
Teacher concerning Kokâlika: and it was while dwelling in Jetavana
monastery. Kokâlika, at the time, was desirous of intoning a doctrinal
recitation before the congregation of the priests. When The Teacher
heard this, he related the following tale:--

 

   Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was reigning at Benares, the
Future Buddha, having been born in a farmer's family, and now come of
age, was making his living by husbandry. Now at that time, a certain
peddler went about selling his wares, which he carried on the back of an
ass. And at every place he came to, he would unload the ass, and
dressing him up in the skin of a lion, let him loose in some field of
rice or barley. And the field-watchers did not dare approach, as they
thought it was a lion. Now one day the peddler took up his abode at the
gate of a village, and while his breakfast was cooking, he dressed up
the ass in the lion's skin, and let him loose in a field of barley. The
field-watchers did not dare

|                                   |                                                   |

approach, as they thought it was a lion, but went home and announced the
news. Then all the inhabitants of the village took up arms, and blowing
conch-shells, and beating drums, went to the field and shouted, so that
the ass became afraid for his life, and brayed. Then the Future Buddha
knew it was an ass, and pronounced the first stanza:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Nay, this is not a lion's roar,<br />
Nor tiger, panther, gives its vent;<br />
But dressed up in a lion's skin,<br />
It is a wretched ass that brays."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   And also the inhabitants of the village knew it was an ass, and beat
him until his bones broke, and took the lion's skin away with them. Then
came the peddler, and seeing that his ass had come to grief, he
pronounced the second stanza:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="5">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Long might the ass have lived to eat<br />
The green and tender barley grain,<br />
Accoutred in the lion's skin,<br />
But that he brayed, and ruined all."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   And while he was thus speaking, the ass died, whereupon the peddler
left him and went his way.

 

   The Teacher, having given this doctrinal instruction, identified the
characters in the Birth-Story:

   "At that time the ass was Kokâlika, but the wise farmer was I
myself."
