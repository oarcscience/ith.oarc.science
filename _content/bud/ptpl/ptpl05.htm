<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> September, 1594, Ky&#333;nyo Sh&#333;nin resigned his position as "J&#363;shoku" (residing priest) of the Hongwanji at Horikawa, Nishi-Rokuj&#333;, in favor of his brother, Junnyo, while Ky&#333;nyo himself made his residence at the new Hongwanji built (1602) at Karasu-maru, Higashi-Rokuj&#333;, the site of which was donated by Tokugawa Iyeyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa Sh&#333;gunate government. Since then, the Hongwanji at Horikawa was designated the</p>  
<p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Western Hongwanji and the one at Karasu-maru the Eastern Hongwanji. With the co-existence of these two centers of power, the followers of the True Sect and their numerous local temples were naturally divided into two groups, alleging their loyalty to either of their two mother Hongwanjis. Those who went to the Eastern Hongwanji were called the Eastern Branch, and the other the Western. Ever since that time, these two branches of the Hongwanji have kept on their brotherly relations, each endeavoring to contribute to the prosperity of their common cause. In 1881, the Eastern Branch came to be known as the &#332;tani Branch, while the Western the Hongwanji Branch.</p>  
<p>After the division, those who successively occupied the position of J&#363;shoku ("residing priest") or Hosshu ("the chief abbot") at the Eastern Hongwanji were: Ky&#333;nyo, Sennyo. Takunyo, Jy&#333;nyo, Ichinyo, Shinnyo, Jy&#363;nyo, Tatsunyo,</p>  
<p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Gonnyo, and Gennyo. The present Hosshu is Sh&#333;nyo who is called K&#333;yen.</p>  
<p>Since its first establishment in 1602, the Eastern Hongwanji had suffered no disaster until 1788 when the great fire of Ky&#333;to consumed the greater parts of the city, and the temple too could not escape its devastating progress. It was rebuilt in 1798, but in 1823 it was again destroyed by a fire. The building was restored in 1835, and burned again in 1858 when Ky&#333;to suffered another great fire. Though a temporary hall was constructed in 1860, it met the same disaster as before, when a war broke out within the city in 1864. The present magnificent building was finished in 1895.</p>  
<p>The Eastern Branch, since its early history, has encouraged the study of its canonical writings and the education of able preachers; and it was during the Kwambun era (1661-1672) that the Lecture Hall of the Kwanzeon-ji was</p>  
<p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></A></p>  
<p>removed from Tsukushi, and the first school was established in Sh&#333;sei Garden, better known by the name of Kikoku-tei. In 1754, this school was <A HREF="errata.htm#8">transferred</A> to Takakura, Ky&#333;to, and the curriculum was prepared on an extended scale. This is what is known as the Takakura College. Among the many noted scholars that were educated at the College, there were the following: Yek&#363;, Yenen, Yerin, Zuiye, Jinrei, Senmy&#333;, Ton-ye, H&#333;kei, Git&#333;, H&#333;kai, Daigan, Tokury&#363;, Reiw&#333;, Reiy&#333;, Sh&#363;zon, Gijy&#333;, Ry&#363;won, Gid&#333;, Jing&#333;, Giten, Gy&#333;chy&#363;, Sengan, Senry&#363;, Kakuju, etc.</p>  
<p>By these savants, the philosophical foundations of not only the True Sect but all the other Buddhist sects were minutely investigated. Since the introduction of Western sciences into the Far East, the College granted the establishment of a new department where Buddhism as well as the sciences and</p>  
<p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></A></p>  
<p>philosophies of the East and West will be studied. In 1901, this new department was <A HREF="errata.htm#9">transferred</A> to Sugamo, T&#333;ky&#333;, and another enlargement and innovation was carried out in order to meet all the requirements of modern education. It can safely be said that this College at present offers a most complete course of study for investigators of Buddhism. After its removal to T&#333;ky&#333;, the College was first presided by Kiyozawa Mansi; and Nanj&#333; Buny&#363; was his successor.</p>  
<p>In 1911, this College was again <A HREF="errata.htm#10">transferred</A> to Takakura, Ky&#333;to, and the name of Shinsh&#363; Daigaku was changed to that of Shinsh&#363; &#332;tani Daigaku. It was first presided by &#332;tani Yeiry&#333;, younger brother of the present Hosshu, Sh&#333;nyo Sh&#333;nin. He was then the chief of the educational department of the Eastern Hongwanji. During his presidency, the present new buildings were completed at Oyama, in Kami-gamo, north of Ky&#333;to. In the last year, Nanj&#333; Buny&#363;</p>  
<p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></A></p>  
<p>became its president.</p>  
<p>Since 1888, the Eastern Hongwanji has been building schools for boys as well as for girls in various parts of Japan, the largest of which is now at Imakumano, Ky&#333;to, where are educated 700 boys belonging to the True Sect. One can judge from this how increasingly influential is growing the educational activity of the Eastern Hongwanji in these days.</p>  
<p>Several monthly periodicals are issued by this branch of the True Sect. "The Sh&#363;h&#333;" is the official organ containing the business reports of the Sect and the accounts of the missionary activities at home and abroad. The paper in which are published the results of scholarly investigation relating to religion and philosophy in general is called "The Mujint&#333;," while those periodicals which concern themselves with the practical side of religion are "The Seishinkai," "The Fuky&#333;kai," "The Ky&#363;d&#333;,"</p>  
<p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> "The Kwanren," "The Futoku," "The Shinfuky&#333;," "The Makoto," "The D&#333;h&#333;," "The H&#333;z&#333;," "The H&#333;wa," "The Hikari," "The Shinsekai no Tokuf&#363;," etc. Besides these, there are many important writings yearly coming from the pen of scholars belonging to the True Sect.</p>  
<p>The Eastern Branch of Hongwanji is at present showing the tendency to become a spiritual center of Japan. The Buddhist families belonging to this denomination amount to more than several millions, and it has over fifty Betsuin (or branch temples), some 8160 Matsuji (or local temples), and several hundreds of lecture halls (or in Japanese <i>Sekky&#333;jo</i>) distributed all over the country. The managers of these places are called either "Rimban," or "Jy&#363;shoku," or "Shunin"; and the Jy&#363;shoku of the local temple, that is, Matsuji, is hereditary as is the master (<i>hosshu</i>) of the mother Hongwanji.</p>  
<p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></A></p>  
<p>The followers of this Sect belong either to a branch temple (<i>betsuin</i>), or to a local temple (<i>matsuji</i>), or to a lecture hall (<i>sekky&#333;jo</i>); and they are called its "Danke" (supporters or donors) or "K&#333;j&#363;" (members or associates). The relation between the local temple and its supporters is close and cordial.</p>  
<p>Missionaries are regularly despatched from the headquarters, who will preach on fixed dates at a branch temple, or local temple or lecture hall. We have at present about 2500 of such travelling preachers. In the larger towns there are some stationary teachers whose mission is to visit factories, educational institutions, young men's associations, etc.; they may also respond to invitations from the <A HREF="errata.htm#11">military</A> post stationed there. There are about 120 stationary teachers. We have, further, several tens of the religious advisers who are sent to teach in the penitentiaries at the request of the government.</p>  
<p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></A></p>  
<p>The Eastern Hongwanji also spends much for philanthropy. One of its successful works attracting much public attention is the establishment of a free lodging station for the poor, in T&#333;ky&#333;.</p>  
<p>The building of a branch temple (<i>betsuin</i>) at Shanghai in 1876 marked the beginning of the foreign missionary work by the Eastern Hongwanji. Since then, the missionaries have been sent to several places in China, Korea, and other lands. These foreign missionaries are called Kaiky&#333;shi, meaning carriers of the Good Law throughout the world in order to bring our brethren to enlightenment.</p>
