### Chapter IV

### Discourse on Repentance <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3)

AT ONE TIME there was a large gathering of literary men and commoners
gathered from Kwong-chow, Shiu-chow and other places, to listen to the
Patriarch's words at his monastery of Tso-kai. The Patriarch ascended
his platform and delivered the following address:--

Come, good people. In Buddhism we should start from our Essence of Mind.
Let us purify our minds always and from one momentary sensation to
another. Let us follow the Path by our own effort, recognise our own
Essence-body, realise that our own mind is Buddha, and free ourselves by
a voluntary observance of the disciplinary rules,--then this gathering
will not be in vain. You have all come from distant places: and your
gathering here shows the affinity that exists among us. Let us now sit
down together in the Indian fashion for Dhyana, while I first lead you
in the ritual of Repentance (*Ksamayati*).

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

When they were seated the Patriarch continued:--The first is the Sila
Incense (Behavior), which symbolises that our minds are free from all
taint of misdeeds, evil, jealousy, avarice, anger, spoilation and
hatred. The second is Samadhi Incense, which symbolises that our mind is
serene under all circumstances--favorable or unfavorable. The third is
Prajna Incense, which means that our minds are free from all
impediments; that we constantly seek to realise our Mind-essence with
wisdom; that we refrain from all evil; that we do all kinds of good acts
with no attachment to the fruit of such action; and that we are
respectful toward our superiors, considerate of our inferiors, and
sympathetic for the destitute and those in trouble. The fourth is the
Incense of Liberation, which means that our minds are in such a
perfectly free state that they cling to nothing and bother themselves
neither with good nor evil. The fifth is the Incense of "Knowledge
gained because of the attainment of Liberation." When our minds cling to
neither good nor evil, we should take care not to let them go to the
other extreme of vacuity and remain in a state of inertia. At this point
we should study and seek to broaden our knowledge so that we can
understand our own minds, thoroughly understand the principles of
Buddhism, be considerate of others in our dealings with them, get rid of
the idea of "self" and "existence," and realise that up to the time when
we obtain enlightenment (*Bodhi*) our true nature (*Tathata*) is
immutable.

Learned Audience:--This five-fold Incense perfumes us from within; we
should not seek it without. Now I want to explain to you this Ritual of
Repentance

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

which is designed to expiate our sins whether committed in the present,
the past or future lives; and whether physical, or by word, or by
thought. (In Buddhist thought, sin is considered not in a legal sense as
something to be punished, or forgiven, or atoned for by sacrifice, but
in its cause-and-effect aspect of Karma and its maturing.)

Please follow me carefully and repeat together what I am going to say.
May we, disciples (from such and such a village), be always free from
the taint of ignorance and delusion. We repent of all our past, present
and future sins and evil deeds committed under delusion or in ignorance.
May their karma be expiated at once and may they never rise again.

May we, disciples (from such and such a village), be always free from
taint of arrogance and dishonesty. We repent of all our past, present
and future evil deeds done in an arrogant or dishonest spirit. May their
karma be expiated at once and may they never rise again.

May we, disciples (from such and such a village), be always free from
taint of envy and jealousy. We repent of all our past, present and
future evil deeds done in an envious or jealous spirit. May their karma
be expiated at once and may they never rise again.

As you will notice, there are two aspects to this repentance ritual: One
refers to repentance for past sin; we ought to repent for all our past
sins and evil deeds committed under delusion or ignorance, arrogance or
dishonesty, jealousy or envy, so as to put an end to all of them. This
is one aspect of repentance. The other aspect refers to future conduct.
Having realised the

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

evil nature of our transgression we make a vow that hereafter we will
put an end to all evil deeds committed under delusion or ignorance,
arrogance or dishonesty, envy or jealousy, and that we will never sin
again. This is the second aspect of repentance. On account of ignorance
and delusion, common people do not always appreciate that in repentance
they must not only feel sorry for their past sins, but must also refrain
from sinning in the future. Since they often take no heed as to their
future conduct, they commit the same sins over again almost before the
past ones are expiated. How can we call that repentance?

Learned Audience: Having repented of our sins, we should take the
following all-embracing vows: Listen very carefully:--

Our Mind-essence is potential of an infinite number of sentient beings.
We vow to bring them all unto deliverance.

We vow to get rid of the evil passions of our minds, inexhaustible
though they seem.

We vow to learn the countless systems of Dharma in our Mind-essence.

We vow to attain the Supreme Buddhahood of our Mind-essence.

We have now vowed to deliver an infinite number of sentient beings; but
what does that mean? It does not mean that I, Hui-neng is going to
deliver them. And who are these sentient beings, potential within our
minds? They are the delusive mind, the deceitful mind, the evil mind,
and such like--all these are sentient beings. Each of them has to be
delivered by oneself by means of his own Essence of Mind; only by his
own deliverance, is it genuine.

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

Now, what does it mean, "delivering oneself by one's own Essence of
Mind?' It means the deliverance of the ignorant, delusive, and the
vexatious beings that spring up within our own mind, by means of Right
Views. With the aid of Right Views and Prajna, the barriers thrown up by
these delusive and ignorant beings may be broken down; so that each of
us will be in a position to deliver himself by his own efforts. The
false will be delivered by truthfulness; the delusive by enlightenment;
the ignorant by wisdom; and the malevolent by benevolence; such is
genuine deliverance.

As to the vow; "to get rid of the inexhaustible evil passions," that
refers to the transcendence of our unreliable and illusive thinking
faculty by the transcendental Wisdom (Prajna) of our Mind-essence. As to
the vow: "to learn the countless systems of Dharma"; there will be no
true knowledge until we have been brought face to face with our Essence
of Mind, by our conforming to the orthodox Dharma on all occasions. As
to the vow, "to attain Supreme Buddahood"; I wish to point out that when
we are able to control our mind to follow the true and orthodox Dharma
on all occasions, and when Prajna always rises in our minds, so that we
can hold aloof from both ignorance and enlightenment, and can do away
with falsehood as well as truth, then we may consider ourselves as
having realised our Buddha-nature, or, in other words, having attained
Buddhahood.

Learned Audience: we should always bear in mind that we are following
the Path for thereby strength is added to our vows. Now, since we have
all taken the four-fold vows, I will teach you the Ritual of the
threefold Guidance.

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

We take "Enlightenment" as our Guide, because it is the fruit of both
merit (*Punya*) and Wisdom (*Prajna*).

We take "Orthodoxy" as our Guide, because it is the best way to get rid
of desire.

We take "Purity" as our Guide, because it is the noblest quality of
mankind.

Hereafter let Shakyamuni, the Enlightened One, be our guide and on no
account should we listen to the suggestions of Mara, the evil one, of
any heretic. We should testify to ourselves by constantly appealing to
the "Three Gems" or our Essence of Mind, in which I advise you to take
refuge. They are:

*Buddha, which stands for Enlightenment;  
Dharma, which stands for Orthodoxy;  
Sangha, which stands for Purity*.

To take refuge in Enlightenment so that evil and delusive notions do not
arise, so that desire decreases, discontent becomes unknown, and lust
and greed no longer bind us--this is the fruitage of Punya and Prajna.
To take refuge in Orthodoxy so that from momentary sensation to another
we will be free from wrong views--this is the best means of getting rid
of desires. To take refuge in Purity so that no matter under what
circumstance we may be, we will not become contaminated by wearisome
sense objects, by craving nor by desire--this is the noblest quality of
mankind. To practise the "Three-fold Guidance" as thus outlined means to
take refuge in one's Mind-essence. Ignorant people often take the
"Three-fold Guidance" without understanding it. They say that they take

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

refuge in Buddha: do they know where he is? If they cannot conceive
Buddha, how can they take refuge in him? Would not such an assertion
amount to self-deception? Each of you should examine this point for
himself, so that his energy may not be misapplied through ignorance. The
Sutra distinctly says that each should take refuge in the Buddha within
himself. It does not refer to any other Buddhas, hence if we do not take
refuge in the Buddha of our own Mind-essence, there is nowhere else for
us to go. Having cleared this point, let each of us take refuge in the
"Three jewels" of his own mind. Within, each should control his own
mind; without, each should be respectful toward others--this is the way
to take refuge within ourselves.

I have a stanza, the reciting and practising of which will at once
dispel the delusions and expiate the sins accumulated during many
kalpas. This is the stanza:--

*People under delusion accumulate tainted merit but tread not the
Path.  
They are under the illusion that to accumulate merit and to tread the
Path are one and the same thing.  
Their merit for alms-giving and offerings may be infinite,  
But they fail to realise that the ultimate source of sin lies in the
greed, hatred and infatuation within their own mind.  
They expect to expiate their sin by the accumulation of merit,  
Without knowing that the felicities to be gained thereby in future
lives*, <span id="page_264">p. 264</span>  
*Have nothing to do with expiation of sin.  
If we get rid of the sin within our own mind  
Then it is a case of true repentance.  
One who realises suddenly what constitutes true repentance in the
Mahayana sense,  
And who ceases to do evil and practises righteousness, is free from
sin*.

\*

*Essence of Mind* (Tathata) *is the real Buddha,  
While heretical views and the three poisonous elements are Mara.  
Enlightened by Right Views, we call forth the Buddha within us.  
When our nature is dominated by the three poisonous elements, as the
result of heretical views,  
We are said to be possessed by Mara;  
But when Right Views free our minds of these poison elements,  
Mara will, be transformed into a real Buddha.  
A follower of the Path who keeps constant watch on his Mind-essence  
Is in the same class with the many Buddhas.  
Our Patriarchs transmitted no other system but this of "Sudden
Enlightenment."  
If you are seeking Dharmakaya,  
Search for it apart from the world of things and phenomena,  
Then your mind will be pure and free.  
Exert yourself in order to come face to face with Mind-essence and relax
not;  
For death may come suddenly and put an end to your earthly existence*.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

Learned Audience:--All of you should recite this stanza and put it into
practice. If you succeed in realising Essence of Mind, then you may
think of yourselves as being in my presence though you may be a thousand
miles away. But should you be unable to do so, though we were face to
face with each other, we would really be thousands of miles apart. In
that case what is the use of your taking the trouble to come here from
such a long distance? Take good care of yourselves. I bid you good-bye.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[257:1](bb29.htm#fr_3) NOTE BY EDITOR. in the
text of the Discourse on Repentance there is a section on "The
Three-fold Body of Buddha" which is evidently out of place. In the first
place, the Discourse was delivered to a gathering of "Literary Men and
Commoners," while the Three-body Discourse, being very metaphysical, is
evidently intended for his advanced disciples. Moreover, while the prose
section of the Repentance section has its following stanza, the
Three-body section has none; hut strange to say, there is a stanza quite
appropriate to it inserted in the Patriarch's final words just before
his death, where it is entirely out of place. The editor has taken the
liberty of bringing the prose section and the stanza together in a
chapter by themselves, which will follow this chapter.
