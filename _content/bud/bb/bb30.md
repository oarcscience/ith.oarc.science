### Chapter V

### Discourse on the Three-Bodies of Buddha

SOME TIME after the foregoing Discourse on Repentance had been delivered
to "commoners" when the Patriarch had gathered his disciples together
for instruction, a senior disciple, Fat-hoi, said to the Patriarch,
"Sir, will you please leave to posterity certain instruction whereby
people under delusion may realise their Buddha-nature?"

"Listen to me," replied the Patriarch. It is possible for those who are
under delusion to realise their Buddha-nature, provided they acquaint
themselves with the nature of ordinary sentient beings. Without such
knowledge, to seek Buddhahood would be in vain, even if one spent aeons
of time in doing so.

First, let me show you how to get acquainted with the nature of the
sentient beings within your mind, whereby one can realise the
Buddha-nature latent in everyone. Knowing Buddha means nothing else than
knowing sentient beings. It is sentient beings who are blind to the fact
that they are potentially Buddhas, whereas a Buddha sees no difference
between himself and other beings. When sentient beings realise their
Essence of Mind, they are Buddhas. If a Buddha is under delusion as to
his Essence of Mind, he is then only an ordinary being. Seeing
everything as equal in Essence of Mind makes ordinary beings Buddhas.
Seeing inequalities in Essence of Mind transforms a Buddha into an
ordinary being. When one's mind is crooked or depraved, then he is only
an ordinary being

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

with Buddha-nature latent within him. On the other hand, if one
concentrates his mind on equality and straightforwardness, even for one
moment only, then he is a Buddha.

Within our mind there is Buddha, and that Buddha within is the real
Buddha. If Buddha is not to be found within our mind, then where shall
we seek for the real Buddha? Doubt not that Buddha is within your own
mind, apart from which nothing can exist. Since all things and phenomena
are the product of mind, the Sutra says: "When mental activity rises,
various things exist; when mental activity ceases, various things exist
not."

Our physical body may be likened to an inn where we can remain only
temporarily, we cannot make it a refuge. The Trikaya of Buddha is to be
found within our Mind-essence which is the common possession of
everybody. It is because the mind of an ordinary man labors under
delusion that he does not know his own inner nature, the result is that
he ignores the Trikaya that is within himself and seeks for it without.
Please listen; I am going to show you that you can realise the Trikaya
within yourself, which being a manifestation of Mind-essence cannot be
found anywhere else.

*Within our physical body we take refuge in the Pure Dharmakaya
(Essence-body) of Buddha;  
Within our physical body we take refuge in the Perfect Sambhoga-kaya
(the Empirical, or Bliss-body) of Buddha;  
Within our physical body we take refuge in the Myriad Nirmanakaya
(Bodies of transformation, or of incarnations of Buddha*.

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

What is the Pure Dharmakaya? Our Mind-essence is intrinsically pure,
that is, all things are manifestations of mind. Good deeds and evil
deeds are but the manifestation of good thoughts and evil thoughts
respectively. Thus within Essence of Mind all things, like the azure of
the sky and the radiance of the sun and moon which, when obscured by
passing clouds, may appear as if their brightness had been dimmed, but
as soon as the clouds are blown away, their brightness reappears and all
objects are again fully illuminated. Foolish thoughts may be likened to
the clouds, while sagacity and Wisdom are the moon and the Sun. When we
become attached to discriminated objects, our Mind-essence becomes
clouded by drifting thoughts which prevent sagacity and Wisdom from
sending forth their light. We were fortunate that we found learned and
pious teachers to make known the orthodox Dharma to us so that we may,
by our own effort do away with ignorance and delusion, and by so doing
we will become enlightened both within and without, and our true nature
within our Essence of Mind will manifest itself. This is precisely what
happens with those who come face to face with their Essence of Mind.
This is what is called the Pure Dharmakaya of Buddha.

To take refuge in the true Buddha is to take refuge in our own Essence
of Mind, He who takes refuge within himself must first get rid of the
evil-mind and the jealous-mind, the flattering and crooked-mind, deceit,
and falsehood, and fallacious views, egotism, snobbishness,
contemptuousness, arrogance, and all other evils that may arise at any
time, To take refuge

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

within ourselves is to be always on the alert to prevent our own
mistakes and to refrain from criticism of other's faults. He who is
humble and patient on all occasions and is courteous to every one, has
truly realised his Mind-essence, so truly in fact that his Path is free
from further obstacles. This is the way to take refuge in (the Buddha
of) oneself.

What is the Perfect Sambhogakaya? Let us take the illustration of a
lamp. Since the light of a lamp can dissipate darkness that has been
there for a thousand years, so a ray of Wisdom can do away with
ignorance that has lasted for ages. We need not bother about the past,
for the past is gone and is irrecoverable. What demands our attention is
the present and future, so let our thoughts, from one momentary
sensation to another, be clear and pure and let us see face to face our
Mind-essence. Goodness and evil are opposite to each other, but in
essence they cannot be dualistic. This non-dualistic nature is called
"true nature," it can neither be contaminated by evil, nor affected by
goodness. This is what is called the Sambhogakaya of Buddha. One single
evil thought clouding our Essence of Mind will undo the good merit
accumulated in aeons of time; while a good thought can expiate all our
sins though they be as many as the sands of the river Ganges. To realise
our Essence of Mind from one momentary sensation to another and without
intermission until we attain Supreme Enlightenment (Bodhi) so that we
are in a perpetual state of Right Mindfulness, is the Sambhogakaya.

Now, what is the Myriad Nirmanakaya? When we subject ourselves to the
least differentiation or particularisation,

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

transformation takes place: otherwise all things would be as void as
space, as they inherently are. By letting our minds dwell on evil
things, hell arises. By letting our minds dwell upon good acts, paradise
is manifested. Dragons and snakes are the transformations of venomous
hatred; while Bodhisattvas are compassionate thoughts made manifest. The
various heavens are the projection of Prajna; while underworlds are the
transformations of ignorance and infatuation. Un-numbered, indeed, are
the transformations of Mind-essence. People under delusion are as if
asleep; they do not understand; their minds naturally turn toward evil
and, as a rule, they practice evil. But should they turn their minds
from evil to righteousness, even for one moment, Prajna shines forth.
This is what is called the Nirmanakaya of the Buddha of Mind-essence.

The Dharmakaya is intrinsically self-sufficient. To see our own Essence
of Mind clearly and without interruption, is the Sambhogakaya of Buddha.
To let our mind dwell on the [Sambogahakaya](errata.htm#10), so that
Prajna radiates forth in manifestation is Nirmanakaya. To attain
enlightenment by one's own effort and to practise by one's self the
goodness that is inherent in our Essence of Mind, is a genuine case of
"taking refuge." Our physical body consisting of flesh and skin, etc.,
is nothing more than a tenement or an inn; it is no place of refuge. Let
us realise the Trikaya of our own Mind-essence, then we shall know the
Buddha of our own nature.

In closing let me leave with you a stanza, entitled: "The Real Buddha of
Mind-essence." Accordingly as

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

they heed it people of future generations who can understand its meaning
will realise their Mind-essence and attain Buddhahood. This is the
stanza:--

*Those who understand the Mahayana teaching  
And are thus able to realise Mind-essence  
Should reverently and fervently seek for a realisation of Dharmakaya.  
The Dharmakaya, the Sambhogakaya, the Nirmanakaya--  
These three Bodies [emanate](errata.htm#11) from Oneness.  
He who is able to realise this fact intuitively  
Has sown the seed and will reap the fruit of Enlightenment.  
It is from Nirmanakaya that our "pure nature" emerges;  
Within the former the latter is always to be found.  
Guided by its "pure nature" Nirmanakaya follows the right path,  
And will some day culminate In a Body of Bliss, perfect and infinite.  
Pure Nature is hidden by our sensual instincts;  
By getting rid of sensuality, we realise Pure Dharmakaya.  
When our temperament is such that we are no longer the slave of the five
sense-objects,  
And when we have realised Mind-essence, even for one moment, then
Tathata is known to us.  
Those who are so fortunate as to be followers of the Sudden School  
Shall suddenly, in this life, see the Blessed One in their own
Mind-essence*. <span id="page_273">p. 273</span>  
*He who has not realised Essence of Mind and seeks for Buddha without,  
Is on a wrong path and is acting foolishly.  
He who seeks Buddha by practising certain doctrines  
Knows not the place where the real Buddha is to be found.  
He who is seeking to realise Buddha within his own mind,  
He only is sowing the seed of Buddhahood*.
