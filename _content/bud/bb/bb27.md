### Chapter II

### Discourse on Prajna <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1)

ON THE FOLLOWING DAY Prefect Wai asked Patriarch to give another
address. Having taken his seat, the Patriarch asked the assembly to
first purify their minds (by a period of dhyana-silence) and then to
join in reciting the Maha Prajna-paramita Sutra, after which he gave the
following address:--

Learned Audience: Prajna, the Wisdom of Enlightenment, is inherent in
every one of us. It is because of the delusions under which our minds
labor that we fail to realise its presence, and that we have to seek the
advice and the guidance of the more highly enlightened before we can
realise it in our mind's Essence. You should know that as far as
Buddha-nature is concerned, there is no difference between an
enlightened man and an ignorant one. What makes the difference is that
one realises it and the other is ignorant of it. Let me speak

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

to you now about the Maha Prajna-paramita Sutra, so that each of you may
attain wisdom. Listen carefully while I speak.

Learned Audience: There are many people who recite the word, Prajna, the
whole day long, who do not seem to know that Prajna is inherent in their
own nature. The mere talking about food will not appease hunger, but
that is the very thing these people are doing. We may talk about the
"Doctrine of Voidness" for myriads of kalpas, but merely talking about
it will not enable one to realise it in his Mind-essence, and the
talking will serve no good purpose in the end.

The name, Maha Prajna-paramita, is Sanskrit and means, "great Wisdom to
reach the opposite shore." Now, what we ought to do with it is to carry
it into practice with our mind; whether we recite it or do not recite it
matters little. Mere reciting without mental practice, may be likened to
a phantasm, a magical delusion, a flash of lighting, or a dew-drop. On
the other hand, if we do both, then our mind will be in accord with what
we repeat orally. Our very self-nature is Buddha, and apart from this
nature there is no other Buddha.

What is Maha? Maha means, "great." The capacity of the mind is as great
as that of space. It is infinite, it is neither round nor square,
neither great nor small, neither green nor yellow, neither red nor
white, neither above nor below, neither long nor short, neither angry
nor happy, neither right nor wrong, neither good nor evil, neither first
nor last. All Buddha-lands are as void as space. Intrinsically our
transcendental nature is void and not a single dharma can be

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

attained. It is the same with Mind-essence which is a state of the
"voidness of non-voidity."

Learned Audience: when you hear me speak about the void, do not fall
into the idea that I mean vacuity. It is of the utmost importance that
we should not fall into that idea, because then when a man sits quietly
and keeps his mind blank he would be abiding in a state of the "voidness
of indifference." The illimitable void of the Universe its capable of
holding myriads of things of various shapes and form, such as the sun
and the moon, and the stars, worlds, mountains, rivers, rivulets,
springs, woods, bushes, good men, bad men, laws pertaining to goodness
and to badness, heavenly planes and hells, great oceans and all the
mountains of Mahameru. Space takes in all these, and so does the
voidness of our nature. We say that Essence of Mind is great because it
embraces all things since all things are within our nature. When we see
the goodness or the badness of other people, and are not attracted by
it, nor repulsed by it, nor attached to it, then the attitude of our
mind is as void as space. In that we see the greatness of our minds,
therefore we call Mind-essence, Maha.

Learned Audience: When ignorant people have ideas they merely talk about
them, but wise men keep them within their own minds and put them into
practice. There is also a class of foolish people who sit quietly and
try to keep their minds blank; they refrain from thinking of anything
and then call themselves "great." Concerning this heretical view, I have
no patience to speak. You should know that the capacity of the mind is
very great since it pervades the whole

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Universe wherever the domain of Law extends.
When we use the mind we can consider everything; when we use Mind to its
full capacity, we shall know all. All under one principle, one principle
in all. When Mind works without hindrance and is at perfect liberty to
come" or to "go," then Mind is Prajna.

Prajna comes from Mind-essence and not from any exterior source. Do not
have any mistaken notion about that. To cherish mistaken notions about
that is to make a "selfish use of True Nature." Once the "True Nature"
of Mind-essence is realised, one will be forever free from delusion.
Since the capacity of Mind is for great things, we should not busy it
with trivial acts. (That is, the mind that can realise Mind-essence
through the right practice of dhyana, ought not to be sitting quietly
with a blank mind nor wasting its resources on idle talk.) Do not talk
all day about "the void, without practising it in the mind. One who does
this may be likened to a self-styled king who is really a commoner.
Prajna can never be attained in that way and those who act like that are
not my disciples.

What is Prajna? It means, Transcendental Wisdom. If we steadily, at all
times and in all places, keep our thoughts free from foolish desire and
act wisely on all occasions, then we are practising the Paramita of
Prajna. One foolish notion is enough to shut-off Prajna; one wise
thought will bring it forth again. People in ignorance or under delusion
do not see this; they talk about it with their tongue but in their mind
they are ignorant of it. They are always saying that they practice
Prajna, and they talk incessantly about "vacuity," but they have not
realised the True Void.

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Prajna is Wisdom's Heart; it has neither form
nor characteristic. If we interpret it in this way, then it is, indeed,
the Wisdom of Prajna.

What is Paramita? It is a Sanskrit word (commonly translated, "ideal")
that means, "to the opposite shore." Figuratively it means, "beyond
existence and non-existence." By clinging to sense things, existence and
non-existence are like the ups and downs of the billowy sea. Such a
state, metaphorically is called, "this shore"; while beyond existence
and non-existence there is a state characterised by non-attachment that
has the undisturbed calmness of running water, that is called, "the
opposite shore." This is why Prajna is called, Paramita.

Learned Audience: People under illusion recite the Maha Prajna-paramita
with their tongue and, while they are reciting it, erroneous and evil
thoughts arise; but if they put it into practice unremittingly they will
come to realise its True Nature. To know this Dharma is to know the Law
of Prajna; and to practice it is to practice Ideal Wisdom. He who does
not practice it is an ordinary man; he who concentrates his mind on its
practice, even if it be but for a moment only, he is the equal of
Buddha. An ordinary man is Buddha! and defilement is Enlightenment
(Bodhi). A passing foolish thought makes one an ordinary man, while an
enlightened thought makes one a Buddha. A passing thought that clings to
sense-objects is defilement; a second thought that frees one from
attachment is Enlightenment.

Maha Prajna-paramita! The Great Transcendental-Wisdom Ideal, supreme,
most exalted, foremost. It

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

neither stays, nor goes, nor comes. By it Buddhas of the present, the
past and future generations attain Buddhahood. We should use this
Perfect Wisdom to break up the five bundles of aggregates that make up
our personality, and thus get rid of the pollutions and contaminations.
To follow such a practice ensures the attainment of Buddhahood. The
three poisonous elements (greed, anger and infatuation) will then be
turned into good conduct (*sila*) and self-realisation (*samadhi*) and
wisdom (*Prajna*). When one is free from defilement, Wisdom reveals
itself steadily and cannot be distinguished from Mind-essence. Those who
understand this Dharma will be free from idle thoughts. To be free from
discriminations, from clinging to desires, from illusions; to set free
one's true nature; to use Prajna for contemplation; to take an attitude
of neither indifference nor attachment towards all things--that is what
is meant by realising one's true Essence of Mind and (in its perfection)
is the attainment of Buddhahood.

Learned Audience: If you wish to penetrate the deepest mystery of the
Dharma-world and experience the deepest realisation (*samadhi*) of
Prajna, you should practice Prajna by reciting and studying the Diamond
Sutra (the *Vajrakkhedika*) which will enable you to realise Essence of
Mind . You should know that the merit for studying this Sutra is
distinctly set forth in the text in laudatory terms; it is immeasurable
and illimitable and cannot be enumerated in detail. This Sutra expounds
the highest thought of Buddhism and our Lord Buddha delivered it
specially for the very wise and quick-witted. The less wise and the
slow-witted

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

doubt its credibility. Why? For example: When it rains through the power
of the celestial Naga on the plains of India, cities, towns and villages
are drifted about as if they were only leaves of the date tree; but
should it rain on the great ocean, the level of the seas of the whole
world would not be affected by it. When the followers of the highest
school of Mahayana study the Diamond Sutra, their minds become
enlightened as they realise that Prajna is immanent in their own
Mind-essence. Since they have their own access to highest wisdom through
the constant practice of concentration and contemplation (dhyana and
samadhi) they realise that they no longer need to rely on scriptural
authority.

The Prajna immanent in the minds of every one may be likened to the
rain, the moisture of which refreshes every living thing, trees and
plants as well as sentient creatures. When rivers and streams reach the
sea, the water carried by them merges into the one body, which is a good
analogy. When rain falls in a deluge, plants which are not deep-rooted
are washed away and eventually they perish. It is the same with the
slow-witted when they hear about the teachings of the "Sudden School."
The Prajna immanent in them is exactly the same as that in very wise
men, but when the Dharma is made known to them they fail to enlighten
themselves. Why is it? It is because their minds are thickly veiled by
erroneous views and deeply rooted infections, just as the sun is often
thickly veiled by clouds and unable to show its splendor until the wind
blows the clouds away. Prajna does not vary with different persons; what
makes the seeming difference is

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

the question whether one's mind is enlightened or is beclouded. He who
does not realise his own Mind-essence, and rests under the delusion that
Buddhahood can be attained by outward religious rites, is rightly called
the slow-witted. He who knows the teachings of the "Sudden School," and
who attaches no importance to ritual, and whose mind al ways functions
under right views so that he is absolutely free of defilement and
contamination, such an one may be said to have realised his
Mind-essence.

Learned Audience: The mind should be framed in such a way that it will
be independent of external and internal things, at liberty to come and
go, free from attachment, thoroughly enlightened, without the least
obscuration. He whose mind is thus framed is able to measure up to the
standard of the Prajna Sutras. The sutras and the scriptures of both the
Mahayana and the Hinayana, as well as the twelve sections of the
canonical writings, were provided to suit the different needs and
temperaments of various people. It is upon the principle that Prajna is
latent in every man that the doctrines expounded in these scriptures are
established. If there were no human beings, there would be no teachings;
hence we know that all teachings are made for man and that all the
Sutras owe their existence to preachers. Some men are wise, the so
called superior men, and some are ignorant, the so called inferior men;
the wise preach to the ignorant when they are asked to do so. Through
this the ignorant may attain sudden enlightenment and their minds will
become illuminated thereby; then they are no longer different from wise
men. Without enlightenment there

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

would be a difference between a Buddha and any other living being; a
gleam of enlightenment is enough to make a living being the equal of a
Buddha. Since all truth (Dharmas) is immanent in our minds, there is no
reason why we should not realise intuitively the real nature of
Mind-essence (*tathata*). The Bodhisattva Sila Sutra says, "Our Essence
of Mind is intrinsically pure; if we knew our mind perfectly and
realised what our self-nature truly is, all of us would attain
Buddhahood." The Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra says, "At once they become
enlightened and regain their true mind."

When the Fifth Patriarch preached to me I became enlightened immediately
after he had spoken and spontaneously I realised the real nature of
Mind-essence (*tathata*). For this reason it is my particular object to
propagate the teaching of the "Sudden" School so that learners may know
enlightenment at once and realise their true nature by introspection of
mind. Should they fail to enlighten themselves they ought to ask some
very pious and learned Buddhist who understands the teachings of this
highest school to show them the right way. The office of a pious and
learned Buddhist who guides others to realise Essence of Mind, is an
exalted position. Through his assistance one may be initiated into all
meritorious Dharmas. The wisdom of Buddhas, past, present and future, as
well as the teachings of the twelve sections of the canon are immanent
in the mind, but in case we fail to enlighten ourselves, we have to seek
the guidance of the pious and learned. On the other hand those who
enlighten themselves need no extraneous help. It is wrong to insist upon
the idea that we cannot obtain liberation without

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

the assistance of the pious and learned. It is by our innate wisdom that
we enlighten ourselves, and even the extraneous help and instruction of
a pious and learned friend would be of no use so long as one is deluded
by false doctrines and erroneous views. As we introspect our minds with
Prajna, all erroneous views will disappear of themselves, and just as
soon as we realise Essence of Mind we will immediately arrive at the
Buddha stage.

When we use Prajna for introspection we are illuminated within and
without and are in position to know our own nature. To realise our own
nature is to obtain fundamental liberation. To obtain liberation is to
attain the Samadhi of Prajna, which is intuitive insight. What is
intuitive insight? Intuitive insight is to see and to realise all
dharmas (things as well as truths) with a mind free from attachment. In
action Prajna is everywhere present yet it "sticks" nowhere. What we
have to do is to so purify the mind that the six aspects of
consciousness (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, mentation) in passing
through their six sense-gates will neither be defiled by nor attached to
their six sense-objects. When our mind works freely without any
hindrance and is at liberty "to come" or "to go, "then we have attained
the intuitive insight of Prajna, which is emancipation. To enable one to
attain such a mental state of freedom is the function of intuitive
insight. To refrain from thinking of anything, in the sense that all
mental activity is suppressed, is to be Dharma-ridden; this is an
extremely erroneous view. (Discriminative thought which leads to desire
and attachment, or to aversion and defilement, is to be

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

controlled in the interests of intuitive thought which leads to
self-realisation and freedom.)

Those who understand the way of intuitive insight will know everything;
they will have the experience that all the Buddhas have had, and they
will attain Buddhahood. In the future, if an initiate of my school
should make a vow in company with his fellow-disciples to devote his
whole life without retrogression to the practice and commemoration of
the teachings of this "Sudden" School, in the same spirit as if he were
serving the Buddha, he would attain without failure the Path that leads
to Bodhisattvahood and Buddhahood. He should transmit from heart the
instructions handed down. from one Patriarch to another, and no attempt
should be made to conceal the orthodox teaching.

Learned Audience: I have a Stanza for all of you to recite. Both laity
and monks should put its teachings into practice, without which I t
would be useless to remember the words alone. Listen to this stanza:--

*A master of the Buddhist canon  
As well as the teachings of the Dhyana school  
Should teach nothing but the Dharma for realising Essence of Mind.  
We can hardly classify dharmas into "sudden" and "gradual,"  
But some men will attain enlightenment quicker than others.  
For example: this system for realising Essence of Mind  
Is beyond the comprehension of the ignorant.  
We may explain it in ten thousand ways*, <span id="page_246">p.
246</span>  
*But all these explanations may be traced back to one principle,  
To illumine our gloomy mind, stained by defilement,  
We should constantly set up the Sun of Wisdom.  
Erroneous views keep us in defilement,  
But right views remove us far from it.  
But when we are in a position to discard both defilement and purity  
Then are we absolutely free.  
Bodhi is immanent in our Mind-essence;  
Any attempt to look for it [elsewhere](errata.htm#7) is foolish.  
Within our defiled minds, purity is to be found,  
And once our mind is set right, we are free from the bonds  
Of defilement, of evil karma, of expiation.  
If we are treading the Path of Enlightenment,  
We need not be worried by stumbling-blocks.  
If we keep an eye constantly on our own faults,  
We cannot go far astray from the right path.  
Every species of life has its own way of salvation;  
They will not be antagonistic one to another.  
If we leave our own path and seek for another way  
Of salvation, we shall never find it.  
Though we plod on till death overtake us  
We shall find only penitence at the end.  
If one wishes to find the true way,  
Right action will lead him to it directly.  
If one has not a mind to aim at Buddhahood,  
One will grope in the dark and never find it.  
He who treads the Path in earnest  
Sees not the mistakes of the world.  
If we find fault with others*, <span id="page_247">p. 247</span>  
*We ourselves are also in the wrong;  
When other people are in the wrong we should ignore it;  
It is wrong for one to find fault with others.  
By getting rid of the habit of fault-finding,  
We get rid of one source of defilement.  
When neither hatred nor love disturb the mind,  
Serene and restful is our sleep.  
Those who intend to be teachers of others  
Should themselves be skillful in the various expedients that lead to
enlightenment.  
When the disciple is free from all doubts  
Then it indicates that his Mind-essence is unclouded.  
This world is the Buddha-world  
Within which enlightenment may be sought.  
To seek enlightenment by separating from this world  
Is as foolish as to search for a rabbit's horn.  
Right views are called "transcendental,"  
Erroneous views are called "worldly,"  
But when all views, both right and erroneous, are discarded,  
Then the essence of Wisdom manifests itself.  
Kalpa after kalpa a man may be under illusion,  
But once enlightened, it takes him but a moment to attain Buddhahood*.

\*

After hearing what the Patriarch had to say, Prefect Wai, the government
officials, Taoists, monks and laymen, were all enlightened. They made
obeisence in a body and exclaimed unanimously, "Well done! Well done!
Who would have expected that a Buddha would be born in Kwongtung?"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[235:1](bb27.htm#fr_1) NOTE BY EDITOR. The
Sanskrit word, *Prajna*, can be translated by "Transcendental Wisdom,"
but that gives a very inadequate idea of it. Bodhi is the word that is
commonly used for "wisdom"; *Prajna* is rather the Principle of Wisdom,
that is, *Prajna* is the Ultimate Principle of Intellection. But
*Prajna* is also the Ultimate Principle of Compassion, because Wisdom
and Love are One in Ultimate Principle. *Prajna* is rather the active
aspect of Ultimate Reality, and as such manifests itself in both
integration and differentiation; as both the unifying urge of
attraction, affection, sympathy, compassion, and the analysing urge of
intelligence and creative activity. If we consider *Prajna* as the
active aspect of the Dharmakaya, then Nirvana is the passive aspect,
while Buddhahood is each and both. Laotsu's Tao, and Bergson's *elan
vital* are perhaps only other names for *Prajna*.
