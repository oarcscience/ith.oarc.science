<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>1. Master of words and sophistry, clever and wise<BR>
Milinda tried to test great N&acirc;gasena's skill.<BR>
Leaving him not&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_321"></A><A HREF="#fn_313"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, again and yet again,<BR>
He questioned and cross-questioned him, until<BR>
His own skill was proved foolishness.<BR>
Then he became a student of the Holy Writ.<BR>
All night, in secrecy, he pondered o'er<BR>
The ninefold Scriptures, and therein he found<BR>
Dilemmas hard to solve, and full of snares.<BR>
And thus he thought: 'The conquering Buddha's words<BR>
Are many-sided, some explanatory,<BR>
Some spoken as occasion rose to speak,<BR>
Some dealing fully with essential points.<BR>
Through ignorance of what, each time, was meant<BR>
There will be strife hereafter as to what<BR>
The King of Righteousness has thus laid down<BR>
In these diverse and subtle utterances.<BR>
Let me now gain great N&acirc;gasena's ear,<BR>
And putting to him that which seems so strange<BR>
And hard--yea contradictory--get him<BR>
To solve it. So in future times, when men<BR>
Begin to doubt, the light of his solutions<BR>
Shall guide them, too, along the path of Truth.'</P>

<P>2. Now Milinda the king, when the night was turning into day, and the sun had risen, bathed, and with hands clasped and raised to his forehead, called to mind the Buddhas of the past, the present, and the future, and solemnly undertook the observance of the eightfold vow, saying to himself: 'For seven days from now will I do penance by taking upon myself the observance of the eight rules, and when my vow is accomplished will I go to the teacher and put to him, as questions, these dilemmas.' So Milinda, the king laid aside his usual dress, and put off his ornaments; and clad in yellow robes, with only a recluse's turban&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_322"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> on his head, in appearance like a hermit, did he carry out the eightfold abstinence, keeping in mind the vow--'For this seven days I am to decide no case at law. I am to harbour no lustful thought, no thought of ill-will, no thought tending to delusion. Towards all slaves, servants, and dependents I am to show a meek and lowly disposition. [<B>91</B>] I am to watch carefully over every bodily act, and over my six organs, of sense. And I am to fill my heart with thoughts of love towards all beings.' Keeping this eightfold vow, establishing his heart in this eightfold moral law, for seven days he went not forth. But as the night was passing into day, at sunrise of the eighth day, he took his breakfast early, and then with downcast eyes and measured words, gentle in manner, collected in thought, glad and pleased and rejoicing in heart, did he go to N&acirc;gasena. And bowing down at his feet, he stood respectfully on one side, and said:</P>
<P>3. 'There is a certain matter, venerable N&acirc;gasena,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A></P>
<P>that I desire to talk over with you alone. I wish no third person to be present. In some deserted spot, some secluded place in the forest, fit in all the eight respects for a recluse, there should this point of mine be put. And therein let there be nothing hid from me, nothing kept secret. I am now in a fit state to hear secret things when we are deep in consultation. And the meaning of what I say can be made clear by illustration. As it is to the broad earth, O N&acirc;gasena, that it is right to entrust treasure when occasion arises for laying treasure by, so is it to me that it is right to entrust secret things when we are deep in consultation.'</P>
<P>4. Then having gone with the master to a secluded spot he further said: 'There are eight kinds of places, N&acirc;gasena, which ought to be altogether avoided by a man who wants to consult. No wise man will talk a matter over in such places, or the matter falls to the ground and is brought to no conclusion. And what are the eight? Uneven ground, spots unsafe by fear of men, windy places, hiding spots, sacred places, high roads, light bamb&ucirc; bridges, and public bathing places.'</P>
<P>The Elder asked: 'What is the objection to each of these?'</P>
<P>The king replied: 'On uneven ground, N&acirc;gasena, [<B>92</B>] the matter discussed becomes jerky, verbose, and diffuse, and comes to nothing. In unsafe places the mind is disturbed, and being disturbed does not follow the point clearly. In windy spots the voice is indistinct. In hiding places there are eavesdroppers. In sacred places the question discussed is apt to be diverted to the serious surroundings. On a high road it is apt to become frivolous, on a</P>
<P><A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A></P>
<P>bridge unsteady and wavering, at a public bathing place the discussion would be matter of common talk. Therefore is it said&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Uneven ground, unsafe and windy spots,<BR>
And hiding places, and god-haunted shrines,<BR>
High roads, and bridges, and all bathing gh&acirc;ts--<BR>
These eight avoid when talking of high things."'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">____________________</P>
<P>5. 'There are eight kinds of people, N&acirc;gasena, who when talking a matter over, spoil the discussion. And who are the eight? He who walks in lust, he who walks in ill-will, he who walks in delusion, he who walks in pride, the greedy man, the sluggard, the man of one idea, and the fool.'</P>
<P>'What is the objection to each of these?' asked the Elder.</P>
<P>'The first spoils the discussion by his lust, the next by his ill-will, the third by his delusions, the fourth by his pride, the fifth by his greed, the sixth by his sloth, the seventh by his narrowness, and the last by his folly. Therefore is it said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"The lustful, angry, or bewildered man,<BR>
The proud, the greedy, or the slothful man,<BR>
The man of one idea, and the poor fool--<BR>
These eight are spoilers of high argument."'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">____________________</P>
<P>6. 'There are nine kinds of people, N&acirc;gasena, who let out a secret that has been talked over with them, and treasure it not up in their hearts. And who are the nine? The lustful man reveals it in obedience to some lust, the ill-tempered man in consequence</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A></P>
<P>of some ill-will, the deluded man under some mistake. [<B>93</B>] The timid man reveals it through fear, and the man greedy for gain to get something out of it. A woman reveals it through infirmity, a drunkard in his eagerness for drink, a eunuch because of his imperfection, and a child through fickleness. Therefore is it said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"The lustful, angry, or bewildered man,<BR>
The timid man, and he who seeks for gain,<BR>
A woman, drunkard, eunuch, or a child--<BR>
These nine are fickle, wavering, and mean.<BR>
When secret things are talked over to them<BR>
They straightway become public property."'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">____________________</P>
<P>7. 'There are eight causes, N&acirc;gasena, of the advance, the ripening of insight. And what are the eight? The advance of years, the growth of reputation, frequent questioning, association with teachers, one's own reflection, converse with the wise, cultivation of the loveable, and dwelling in a pleasant land. Therefore is it said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"By growth in reputation, and in years,<BR>
By questioning, and by the master's aid,<BR>
By thoughtfulness, and converse with the wise,<BR>
By intercourse with men worthy of love,<BR>
By residence within a pleasant spot--<BR>
By these nine is one's insight purified.<BR>
They who have these, their wisdom grows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">____________________</P>
<P>8. 'This spot, N&acirc;gasena, is free from the objections to talking matters over. And I am a model companion for any one desiring to do so. I can keep a</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A></P>
<P>secret, and will keep yours as long as I live. In all the eight ways just described my insight has grown ripe. It would be hard to find such a pupil as you may have in me.</P>
<P>[<B>94</B>] 'Now towards a pupil who conducts himself thus aright the teacher ought to conduct himself in accordance with the twenty-five virtues of a teacher. And what are the twenty-five? He must always and without fail keep guard over his pupil. He must let him know what to cultivate, and what to avoid; about what he should be earnest, and what he may neglect. He must instruct him as to sleep, and as to keeping himself in health, and as to what food he may take, and what reject. He should teach him discrimination&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (in food), and share with him all that is put, as alms, into his own bowl. He should encourage him, saying: "Be not afraid. You will gain advantage (from what is here taught you)." He should advise him as to the people whose company he should keep, and as to the villages and Vih&acirc;ras he should frequent. He should never indulge in (foolish) talk&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with him. When he sees any defect in him he should easily pardon it. He should be zealous, he should teach nothing partially, keep nothing secret, and hold nothing back&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. He should look upon him in his heart as a son, saying to himself: "I have begotten him in</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A></P>
<P>learning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_320"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." He should strive to bring him forward, saying to himself: "How can I keep him from going back? "He should determine in himself to make him strong in knowledge, saying to himself: "I will make him mighty." He should love him, never desert him in necessity, never neglect him in anything he ought to do for him, always befriend him--so far as he can rightly do so&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_321"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>--when he does wrong. These, Sir, are the twenty-five good qualities in a teacher. Treat me altogether in accordance therewith. Doubt, Lord, has overcome me. There are apparent contradictions in the word of the Conqueror. About them strife will hereafter arise, and in future times it will be hard to find a teacher with insight such as yours. Throw light for me on these dilemmas, to the downfall of the adversaries.'</P>
<P>9. Then the Elder agreed to what he had said, and in his turn set out the ten good qualities which ought to be found in a lay disciple: 'These ten, O king, are the virtues of a lay disciple. He suffers like pain and feels like joy as the Order does. He takes the Doctrine (Dhamma) as his master. He delights in giving so far as he is able to give. On seeing the religion (Dhamma) of the Conqueror decay, he does his best to revive it. He holds right views. Having no passion for excitement&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_322"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, he runs</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_144"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 144</FONT></A></P>
<P>not after any other teacher his life long. He keeps guard over himself in thought and deed. He delights in peace, is a lover of peace. He feels no jealousy, [<B>95</B>] and walks not in religion in a quarrelsome spirit. He takes his refuge in the Buddha, he takes his refuge in the Doctrine, he takes his refuge in the Order. These, great king, are the ten good qualities of a lay disciple. They exist all of them in you. Hence is it fit, and right, and becoming in you that, seeing the decay of the religion of the Conqueror, you desire its prosperity. I give you leave. Ask of me whatever you will.'</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">[ON HONOURS PAID TO THE BUDDHA.]</H3>
<P>10. <FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">Then Milinda the king, having thus been granted leave, fell at the feet of the teacher, and raising his clasped hands to his forehead, said: 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, these leaders of other sects say thus: "If the Buddha accepts gifts he cannot have passed entirely away. He must be still in union with the world, having his being somewhere in it, in the world, a shareholder in the things of the world; and therefore any honour paid to him becomes empty and vain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. On the other hand if he</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_145"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 145</FONT></A></P>
<P>be entirely passed away (from life), unattached to the world, escaped from all existence, then honours would not be offered to him. For he who is entirely set free accepts no honour, and any act done to him who accepts it not becomes empty and vain." This is a dilemma which has two horns. It is not a matter within the scope of those who have no mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, it is a question fit for the great. Tear asunder this net of heresy, put it on one side. To you has this puzzle been put. Give to the future sons of the Conqueror eyes wherewith to see the riddle to the confusion of their adversaries.'</P>
<P>'The Blessed One, O king,' replied the Elder, 'is entirely set free. And the Blessed One accepts no gift. Even at the foot of the Tree of Wisdom he abandoned all accepting of gifts, how much more then now when he has passed entirely away by that kind of passing away which leaves no root over (for the formation of a new existence). For this, O king, has been said by S&acirc;riputta, the commander of the faith&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Though worshipped, these Unequalled Ones, alike<BR>
By gods and men, unlike them all they heed<BR>
Neither a gift nor worship. They accept<BR>
It not, neither refuse it. Through the ages<BR>
All Buddhas were so, so will ever be&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!"'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_146"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 146</FONT></A></P>
<P>11. The king said: 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, a father may speak in praise of his son, or a son of his father. But that is no ground for putting the adversaries to shame. It is only an expression of their own belief, Come now! Explain this matter to me fully to the establishing of your own doctrine, [<B>96</B>] and to the unravelling of the net of the heretics.'</P>
<P>The Elder replied: 'The Blessed One, O king, is entirely set free (from life). And the Blessed One accepts no gift. If gods or men put up a building to contain the jewel treasure of the relics of a Tath&acirc;gata who does not accept their gift, still by that homage paid to the attainment of the supreme good under the form of the jewel treasure of his wisdom do they themselves attain to one or other of the three glorious states&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Suppose, O king, that though a great and glorious fire had been kindled, it should die out, would it then again accept any supply of dried grass or sticks?'</P>
<P>'Even as it burned, Sir, it could not be said to accept fuel, how much less when it had died away, and ceased to burn, could it, an unconscious thing, accept it?'</P>
<P>'And when that one mighty fire had ceased, and gone out, would the world be bereft of fire?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not. Dry wood is the seat, the basis of fire, and any men who want fire can, by the exertion of their own strength and power, such as resides in individual men, once more, by twirling the firestick, produce fire, and with that fire do any work for which fire is required.'</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_147"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147</FONT></A></P>
<P>'Then that saying of the sectarians that "an act done to him who accepts it not is empty and vain" turns out to be false. As that great and glorious fire was set alight, even so, great king, was the Blessed One set alight in the glory of his Buddhahood over the ten thousand world systems. As it went out, so has he passed away into that kind of passing away in which no root remains. As the fire, when gone out, accepted no supply of fuel, just so, and for the good of the world, has his accepting of gifts ceased and determined. As men, when the fire is out, and has no further means of burning, then by their own strength and effort, such as resides in individual men, twirl the fire-stick and produce fire, and do any work for which fire is required--so do gods and men, though a Tath&acirc;gata has passed away and no longer accepts their gifts, yet put up a house for the jewel treasure of his relics, and doing homage to the attainment of supreme good under the form of the jewel treasure of his wisdom, they attain to one or other of the three glorious states. [<B>97</B>] Therefore is it, great king, that acts done to the Tath&acirc;gata, notwithstanding his having passed away and not accepting them, are nevertheless of value and bear fruit.'</P>
<P>12. 'Now hear, too, another reason for the same thing. Suppose, O king, there were to arise a great and mighty wind, and that then it were to die away. Would that wind acquiesce in being produced again?'</P>
<P>'A wind that has died away can have no thought or idea of being reproduced. And why? Because the element wind is an unconscious thing.'</P>
<P>'Or even, O king, would the word "wind" be</P>
<P><A NAME="page_148"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 148</FONT></A></P>
<P>still applicable to that wind, when it had so died away?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir. But fans and punkahs are means for the production of wind. Any men who are oppressed by heat, or tormented by fever, can by means of fans and punkahs, and by the exertion of their own strength and power, such as resides in individual men, produce a breeze, and by that wind allay their heat, or assuage their fever.'</P>
<P>'Then that saying of the sectarians that "an act done to him who accepts it not is empty and vain" turns out to be false. As the great and mighty wind which blew, even so, great king, has the Blessed One blown over the ten thousand world systems with the wind of his love, so cool, so sweet, so calm, so delicate. As it first blew, and then died away, so has the Blessed One, who once blew with the wind so cool, so sweet, so calm, so delicate, of his love, now passed away with that kind of passing away in which no root remains. As those men were oppressed by heat and tormented with fever, even so are gods and men tormented and oppressed with threefold fire and heat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_328"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. As fans and punkahs are means of producing wind, so the relics and the jewel treasure of the wisdom of a Tath&acirc;gata are means of producing the threefold attainment. [<B>98</B>] And as men oppressed by heat and tormented by fever can by fans and punkahs produce a breeze, and thus allay the heat and assuage the fever, so can gods and men by offering reverence to the relics, and the</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A></P>
<P>jewel treasure of the wisdom of a Tath&acirc;gata, though he has died away and accepts it not, cause goodness to arise within them, and by that goodness can assuage and can allay the fever and the torment of the threefold fire. Therefore is it, great king, that acts done to the Tath&acirc;gata, notwithstanding his having passed away and not accepting them, are nevertheless of value and bear fruit.'</P>
<P>13. 'Now hear another reason. for the same thing. Suppose, O king, a man were to make a drum sound, and then that sound were to die away. Would that sound acquiesce in being produced again?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir. The sound has vanished. It can have no thought or idea of being reproduced. The sound of a drum when it has once been produced and died away, is altogether cut off. But, Sir, a drum is a means of producing sound. And any man, as need arises, can by the effort of power residing in himself, beat on that drum, and so produce a sound.'</P>
<P>'Just so, great king, has the Blessed One--except the teacher and the instruction he has left in his doctrine and discipline, and the jewel treasure of his relics whose value is derived from his righteousness, and contemplation, and wisdom, and emancipation, and insight given by the knowledge of emancipation--just so has he passed away by that kind of passing away in which no root remains. But the possibility of receiving the three attainments is not cut off because the Blessed One has passed away. Beings oppressed by the sorrow of becoming can, when they desire the attainments, still receive them by means of the jewel treasure of his relics and of his doctrine and discipline and teaching. Therefore is it, great king, that</P>
<P><A NAME="page_150"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 150</FONT></A></P>
<P>all acts done to the Tath&acirc;gata, notwithstanding his having passed away and not accepting, are nevertheless of value and bear fruit. And this future possibility, great king, has been foreseen by the Blessed One, and spoken of, and declared, and made known, when he said: "It may be, &Acirc;nanda, that in some of you the thought may arise: [<B>99</B>] 'The word of the Master is ended. We have no Teacher more!' But it is not thus, &Acirc;nanda, that you should regard it. The Truth which I have preached to you, the Rules which I have laid down for the Order, let them, when I am gone, be the Teacher to you&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." So that because the Tath&acirc;gata has passed away and consents not thereto, that therefore any act done to him is empty and vain--this saying of the enemy is proved false. It is untrue, unjust, not according to fact, wrong, and perverse. It is the cause of sorrow, has sorrow as its fruit, and leads down the road to perdition!'</P>
<P>14. 'Now hear another reason for the same thing. Does the broad earth acquiesce, O king, in all kinds of seeds being planted all over it?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Then how is it those seeds, planted without the earth's consent, do yet stand fast and firmly rooted, and expand into trees with great trunks and sap and branches, and bearing fruits and flowers?'</P>
<P>'Though the earth, Sir, gives no consent, yet it acts as a site for those seeds, as a means of their development. Planted on that site they grow, by</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A></P>
<P>its means, into such great trees with branches, flowers, and fruit.'</P>
<P>'Then, great king, the sectaries are destroyed, defeated, proved wrong by their own words when they say that "an act done to him who accepts it not is empty and vain." As the broad earth, O king, is the Tath&acirc;gata, the Arahat, the Buddha supreme. Like it he accepts nothing. Like the seeds which through it attain to such developments are the gods and men who, through the jewel treasures of the relics and the wisdom of the Tath&acirc;gata--though he have passed away and consent not to it--being firmly rooted by the roots of merit, become like unto trees casting a goodly shade by means of the trunk of contemplation, the sap of true doctrine, and the branches of righteousness, and bearing the flowers of emancipation, and the fruits of Sama<I>n</I>aship. [<B>100</B>] Therefore is it, great king, that acts done to the Tath&acirc;gata, notwithstanding his having passed away and not accepting them, are still of value and bear fruit.'</P>
<P>15. 'Now hear another and further reason for the same thing. Do camels, buffaloes, asses, goats, oxen, or men acquiesce in the birth of worms inside them?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Then how is it then, that without their consent worms are so born, and spread by rapid reproduction of sons and grandsons?'</P>
<P>'By the power of evil Karma, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Just so, great king, is it by the power of the relics and the wisdom of the Tath&acirc;gata, who has passed away and acquiesces in nothing, that an act done to him is of value and bears fruit.'</P>
<P><A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A></P>
<P>16. 'Now hear another and further reason for the same thing. Do men consent, O king, that the ninety-eight diseases should be produced in their bodies?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Then how is it the diseases come?'</P>
<P>'By evil deeds done in former births.'</P>
<P>'But, great king, if evil deeds done in a former birth have to be suffered here and now, then both good and evil done here or done before has weight and bears fruit. Therefore is it that acts done to the Tath&acirc;gata, notwithstanding his having passed away and not consenting, are nevertheless of value and bear fruit.'</P>
<P>17. 'Now hear another and further reason for the same thing. Did you ever hear, O king, of the ogre named Nandaka, who, having laid hands upon the Elder S&acirc;riputta, was swallowed up by the earth?'</P>
<P>'Yes, Sir, that is matter of common talk among men.'</P>
<P>'Well, did S&acirc;riputta acquiesce in that?'</P>
<P>[<B>101</B>] 'Though the world of gods and men, Sir, were to be destroyed, though the sun and moon were to fall upon the earth, though Sineru the king of mountains were to be dissolved, yet would not S&acirc;riputta the Elder have consented to any pain being inflicted on a fellow creature. And why not? Because every condition of heart which could cause him to be angry or offended has been in him destroyed and rooted out. And as all cause thereof had thus been removed, Sir, therefore could not S&acirc;riputta be angered even with those who sought to deprive him of his life.'</P>
<P><A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A></P>
<P>'But if S&acirc;riputta, O king, did not consent to it, how was it that Nandaka was so swallowed up?'</P>
<P>'By the power of his evil deeds.'</P>

Suppose, O king, a dart well burnished, free from rust, perfectly smooth, with a fine edge, straight, without a crook or a flaw in it, were to be set on a powerful crossbow.

<P>27. 'Now of these, O king, the last--the thinking powers of the omniscient Buddhas--altogether outclasses the other six, and is clear and active in its high quality that is beyond our ken. It is because the mind of the Blessed One is so clear and active that the Blessed One, great king, displays the double miracle. From that we may get to know, O king, how clear and active His mental powers are. And for those wonders there is no further reason that can be alleged. (Yet) those wonders, O king, [caused by means of the mind (alone) of the omniscient Buddhas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_351"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>] cannot be counted, or calculated, or divided, or separated, (For) the knowledge of the Blessed One, O king, is dependent upon reflection&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and it is on reflection that he knows whatever he wishes to know. (But) it is as when a man passes something he already has in one hand to the other, or utters a sound when his mouth is open, or swallows some food that he has already in his mouth, or opens his eyes when they are shut, or shuts them when open, or stretches forth his arm when it is bent in, or bends it in when stretched out--more rapid than that, great king, and more easy in its action, is the all-embracing knowledge of the Blessed One, more rapid than that his reflection. And although it is by reflection that they know whatever they want to know, yet even when they</P>

<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A></P>
<P>are not reflecting the Blessed Buddhas are not, even then, anything other than omniscient.'</P>
<P>'But, venerable N&acirc;gasena, reflection is carried on for the purpose of seeking (that which is not clear when the reflection begins). Come now. Convince me in this matter by some reason.'</P>
<P>'Suppose, O king, there were a rich man, great in wealth and property--one who had stores of gold and silver and valuables, and stores of all kinds of wheat, one who had rice, and paddy, and barley, and dry grain, and oilseed, and beans, and peas, and every other edible seed, who had ghee, and oil, and butter, and milk, and curds, and honey, and sugar, and molasses, [<B>107</B>] all put away in store-rooms in jars, and pots, and pans, and every sort of vessel. Now if a traveller were to arrive, one worthy of hospitality, and expecting to be entertained; and all the prepared food in the house had been finished, and they were to get out of the jar some rice ready for cooking, and prepare a meal for him. Would that wealthy man merely by reason of the deficiency in eatable stuff at that unusual time be rightly called poor or needy?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir. Even in the palace of a mighty king of kings there might be no food ready out of time, how much less in the house of an ordinary man.'</P>
<P>'Just so, great king, with the all-embracing knowledge of a Tath&acirc;gata when reflection only is wanting; but which on reflection grasps whatever he wants. Now suppose, O king, there were a tree in full fruit, with its branches bending this way and that by the weight of the burden of the bunches of its fruit, but no single fruit had fallen from it.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Could that tree rightly, under the circumstances of the case, be called barren, merely because of the want of a fallen fruit?'</P>
<P>'No, Sir. For though the falling of the fruit is a condition precedent to its enjoyment, yet when it has fallen one can take as much as one likes.'</P>
<P>'Just so, great king, though reflection is a necessary condition of the knowledge of the Tath&acirc;gata, yet on reflection it perceives whatever he wants to know.'</P>
<P>'Does that happen always, N&acirc;gasena, at the moment of reflection?'</P>
<P>'Yes, O king. just as when the mighty king of kings (the <I>K</I>akkavatti) calling to mind his glorious wheel of victory wishes it to appear, and no sooner is it thought of than it appears--so does the knowledge of the Tath&acirc;gata follow continually on reflection.'</P>
<P>'Strong is the reason you give, N&acirc;gasena, for the omniscience of the Buddha. I am convinced that that is so.'</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A></P>
<P>'Those six young nobles, O king, Bhaddiya and Anuruddha and &Acirc;nanda and Bhagu and Kimbila and Devadatta, [<B>108</B>] together with Up&acirc;li the barber as a seventh--they all, when the Master had attained to Buddhahood, left the S&acirc;kya home out of the delight they felt in him, and following the Blessed One renounced the world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. So the Blessed One admitted them all to the Order.'</P>
<P>'But was it not Devadatta who, after he had entered the Order, raised up a schism within it?'</P>
<P>'Yes. No layman can create a schism, nor a sister of the Order, nor one under preparatory instruction, nor a novice of either sex. It must be a Bhikkhu, under no disability, who is in full communion, and a co-resident&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_348"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</P>
<P>'And what Karma does a schismatical person gain?'</P>
<P>'A Karma that continues to act for a Kalpa (a very long period of time).'</P>
<P>'What then, N&acirc;gasena! Was the Buddha aware that Devadatta after being admitted to the Order would raise up a schism, and having done so would suffer torment in purgatory for a Kalpa?'</P>
<P>'Yes, the Tath&acirc;gata, knew that.'</P>
<P>'But, N&acirc;gasena, if that be so, then the statement that the Buddha was kind and pitiful, that he sought after the good of others, that he was the remover of that which works harm, the provider of that which works well to all beings--that statement must be wrong. If it be not so--if he knew not that Devadatta</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A></P>
<P>after he had been admitted to the Order would stir up a schism--then he cannot have been omniscient. This other double-pointed dilemma is put to you. Unravel this tough skein, break up the argument of the adversaries. In future times it will be hard to find Bhikkhus like to you in wisdom. Herein then show your skill!'</P>
<P>29. 'The Blessed One, O king, was both full of mercy and had all knowledge. It was when the Blessed One in his mercy and wisdom considered the life history of Devadatta that he perceived how, having heaped up Karma on Karma, he would pass for an endless series of Kalpas from torment to torment, and from perdition to perdition. And the Blessed One knew also that the infinite Karma of that man would, because he had entered the Order, become finite, and the sorrow caused by the previous Karma would also therefore become limited. [<B>109</B>] But that if that foolish person were not to enter the Order then he would continue to heap up Karma which would endure for a Kalpa. And it was because he knew that that, in his mercy, he admitted him to the Order.'</P>
<P>'Then, N&acirc;gasena, the Buddha first wounds a man and then pours oil on the wound, first throws a man down a precipice and then reaches out to him an assisting hand, first kills him and then seeks to give him life, first gives pain and then adds a subsequent joy to the pain he gave.'</P>
<P>'The Tath&acirc;gata, O king, wounds people but to their good, he casts people down but to their profit, he kills people but to their advantage. just as mothers and fathers, O king, hurt their children and even knock them down, thinking the while of their</P>
<P><A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A></P>
<P>good; so by whatsoever method an increase in the virtue of living things can be brought about, by that method does he contribute to their good. If Devadatta, O king, had not entered the Order, then as a layman he would have laid up much Karma leading to states of woe, and so passing for hundreds of thousands of Kalpas from torment to misery, and from one state of perdition to another, he would have suffered constant pain. It was knowing that, that in his mercy, the Blessed One admitted Devadatta to the Order. It was at the thought that by renouncing the world according to His doctrine Devadatta's sorrow would become finite that, in his mercy, he adopted that means of making his heavy sorrow light.</P>
<P>30. 'As a man of influence, O king, by the power of his wealth or reputation or prosperity or birth, when a grievous penalty has been imposed by, the king on some friend or relative of his, would get it made light by the ability arising from the trust reposed in him; [<B>110</B>] just so did the Blessed One, by admitting him to the Order, and by the efficacy of the influence of righteousness and meditation and wisdom and emancipation of heart, make light the heavy sorrow of Devadatta, who would have had to suffer many hundreds of thousands of Kalpas. As a clever physician and surgeon, O king, would make a grievous sickness light by the aid of a powerful medicinal drug, just so did the Blessed One, in his knowledge of the right means to an end, admit Devadatta to the Order and thus make his grievous pain light by the aid of the medicine of the Dhamma, strong by the power of mercy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

<P>the Blessed One guilty of any wrong in that he turned Devadatta from being a man of much sorrow into being a man of less sorrow?'</P>
<P>'No indeed, Sir. He committed no wrong, not even in the smallest degree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</P>
<P>'Then accept this, great king, to the full as the reason for which the Blessed One admitted Devadatta to the Order.'</P>
<P>31. 'Hear another and further reason, O king, for the Blessed One's having admitted Devadatta. Suppose men were to seize and hurry before the king some wicked robber, saying: "This is the wicked robber, your Majesty. Inflict upon him such punishment as you think fit!" And thereupon the king were to say to them: "Take this robber then, my men, outside the town, and there on the place of execution cut off his head." And they in obedience to his orders were to take that man accordingly towards the place of execution. And some man who was high in office near the king, and of great reputation and wealth and property, whose word was held of weight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and whose influence was great, should see him. And he were to have pity on him, and were to say to those men: "Stay, good fellows. What good will cutting off his head do to you? Save him alive, and cut off only a hand or a foot. I will speak on his behalf to the king." And they at the word of that influential person were to do so. Now would the officer who had acted so towards him have been a benefactor to that robber?'</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_167"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 167</FONT></A></P>
<P>'He would have saved his life, Sir. And having done that, what would he not have done?'</P>
<P>'But would he have done no wrong on account of the pain the man suffered [<B>111</B>] when his hand or foot was cut off?'</P>
<P>'The pain the thief suffered, Sir, was his own fault. But the man who saved his life did him no harm.'</P>
<P>'Just so, great king, was it in his mercy that the Blessed One admitted Devadatta, with the knowledge that by that his sorrow would be mitigated.'</P>
<P>32. 'And Devadatta's sorrow, O king, was mitigated. For Devadatta at the moment of his death took refuge in Him for the rest of his existences when he said:</P><DIR>

<P>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>'If you divide this Kalpa, O king, into six parts, it was at the end of the first part that Devadatta created schism in the Order.

<P>has caused him to attain to the state of a Pa<I>kk</I>eka-Buddha, what has he not done for him?'</P>
<P>'But inasmuch as Devadatta, O king, having made a schism in the Order, suffers pain in purgatory, has not therefore the Blessed One done him wrong?'</P>
<P>'No, Sir. That is Devadatta's own fault; and the Blessed One who mitigated his suffering has done him no harm.'</P>
<P>'Then accept this, O king, to the full as the reason for the Blessed One admitting Devadatta to the Order.</P>
<P>33. 'Hear another and further reason, O king, for his having done so. [<B>112</B>] Suppose in treating a wound full of matter and blood, in whose grievous hollow the weapon which caused it remained, which stank of putrid flesh, and was made worse by the pain that varied with constantly changing symptoms, by variations in temperature, and by the union of the three humours,--windy, bilious, and phlegmatic&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,--an able physician and surgeon were to anoint it with a rough, sharp, bitter, stinging ointment, to the end that the inflammation should be allayed. And when the inflammation had gone down, and the wound had become sweet, suppose he were then to cut into it with a lancet, and burn it with caustic. And when he had cauterised it, suppose he were to prescribe an alkaline wash, and anoint it with some drug to the end that the wound might heal up, and the sick man recover his health--now tell me, O king, would it be out of cruelty that the surgeon thus smeared with ointment, and cut with the lancet, and cauterised</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A></P>
<P>with the stick of caustic, and administered a salty wash?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir; it would be with kindness in his heart, and intent on the man's weal, that he would do all those things.'</P>
<P>'And the feelings of pain produced by his efforts to heal--would not the surgeon be guilty of any wrong in respect of them?'</P>
<P>'How so? Acting with kind intent and for the man's weal, how could he therein incur a wrong? It is of heavenly bliss rather that that kindly surgeon would be worthy.'</P>
<P>'Just so, great king, was it in his mercy that the Blessed One admitted Devadatta, to the end to release him from pain.'</P>
<P>34. 'Hear another and further reason, O king, why the Blessed One did so. Suppose a man had been pierced by a thorn. And another man with kindly intent and for his good were to cut round the place with another sharp thorn or with a lancet, and the blood flowing the while, were to extract that thorn. Now would it be out of cruelty that he acted so?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir. For he acted with kindly intent, and for the man's good. And if he had not done so the man might have died, or might have suffered such pain that he would have been nigh to death.'</P>
<P>'Just even so, great king, was it of his mercy that the Tath&acirc;gata admitted Devadatta, to the end to release him of his pain. If he had not done so [<B>113</B>] Devadatta would have suffered torment in purgatory through a succession of existences, through hundreds of thousands of Kalpas.'</P>

<P>'Yes, N&acirc;gasena, the Tath&acirc;gata turned Devadatta, who was being carried down with the flood, with his head against the stream; he again pointed out the road to Devadatta when he was lost in the jungle; he gave a firm foothold to Devadatta when he was falling down the precipice: he restored Devadatta to peace when he was swallowed up of desolation. But the reason and the meaning of these things could no one have pointed out, N&acirc;gasena, unless he were wise as you!'</P>

<P>36. 'The Blessed One made the statement you refer to, O king, and yet the earth shook seven times at Vessantara's largesse. But that was out of season, it was an isolated occurrence, it was not included in the eight usual causes, and was not therefore reckoned as one of them. just, O king, as there are three kinds of well-known rains reckoned in the world-that of the rainy season, that of the winter months, and that of the two months &Acirc;s&acirc;<I>lh</I>a and S&acirc;vana. If, besides these, any other rain falls, that is not reckoned among the usual rains, but is called "a rain out of season." And again, O king, just as there are five hundred rivers which flow down from the Him&acirc;layas, but of these ten only are reckoned in enumerations of rivers--the Ganges, the Jumna, the A<I>k</I>iravat&icirc;, the Sarabh&ucirc;, the Mah&icirc;, the Indus, the Sarasvat&icirc;, the Vetravat&icirc;, the V&icirc;ta<I>m</I>s&acirc;, and the <I>K</I>andabh&acirc;g&acirc;--the others not being included in the catalogue because of their intermittent flow of water. And again, O king, just as there are a hundred or two of officers under the king, but only six of them are reckoned as officers of state--the commander-in-chief, the prime minister, and the chief judge, and the high treasurer, and the bearer of the sunshade of state, and the state sword-bearer. And why? Because of their royal prerogatives. The rest are not reckoned, they are all called simply officers. [<B>115</B>] Just as in all these cases, great king, the seven times repeated earthquake at the largesse of Vessantara was, as an isolated and extra</P>
<P><A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A></P>
<P>ordinary occurrence, and distinct from the eight usual ones, not reckoned among those eight causes.'</P>
<P>37. 'Now have you heard, O king, in the history of our faith of any act of devotion being done so as to receive its recompense even in this present life, the fame of which has reached up to the gods?'</P>
<P>'Yes, Lord, I have heard of such. There are seven cases of such actions.'</P>
<P>'Who were the people who did those things?'</P>
<P>'Sumana the garland maker, and Eka-s&acirc;<I>t</I>aka the brahman, and Pu<I>nn</I>a the hired servant, and Mallik&acirc; the queen, and the queen known as the mother of Gop&acirc;la, and Suppiy&acirc; the devoted woman, and Pu<I>nn</I>&acirc; the slave-girl. It was these seven who did acts of devotion which bare fruit even in this life, and the fame of which reached even to the gods.'</P>
<P>'And have you heard of others, O king, who, even in their human body, mounted up to the blessed abode of the great Thirty-three?'</P>
<P>'Yes, I have heard, too, of them.'</P>
<P>'And who were they?'</P>
<P>'Guttila the musician, and S&acirc;dh&icirc;na the king, and king Nimi, and king Mandh&acirc;t&acirc;--these four. Long ago was it done, this glorious deed and difficult.'</P>
<P>'But have you ever heard, O king, of the earth shaking, either now or in the past, and either once or twice or thrice, when a gift had been given?'</P>
<P>'No, Sir, that I have not heard of.'</P>
<P>'And I too, O king--though I have received the traditions, and been devoted to study, and to hearing the law, and to learning by heart, and to the acquirements of discipleship, and though I have been ready to learn, and to ask and to answer questions, and to sit at the feet of teachers--I too have never heard</P>
<P><A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A></P>
<P>of such a thing, except only in the case of the splendid gift of Vessantara the glorious king. And between the times of Kassapa the Blessed One, and of the Blessed One the S&acirc;kya sage, there have rolled by hundreds of thousands of years, but in all that period I have heard of no such case. [<B>116</B>] It is at no common effort, O king, at no ordinary struggle, that the great earth is moved. It is when overborne by the weight of righteousness, overpowered by the burden of the goodness of acts which testify of absolute purity, that, unable to support it, the broad earth quakes and trembles and is moved. Then it is as when a wagon is overladen with a too heavy weight, and the nave and the spokes are split, and the axletree is broken in twain. Then it is as when the heavens, overspread with the waters of the tempest driven by the wind, and overweighted with the burden of the heaped-up rain-clouds, roar and creak and rage at the onset of the whirlwind. Thus was it, great king, that the broad earth, unable to support the unwonted burden of the heaped-up and wide-reaching force of king Vessantara's largesse, quaked and trembled and was moved. For the heart of king Vessantara was not turned in the way of lust, nor of ill-will, nor of dullness, nor of pride, nor of delusion, nor of sin, nor of disputation, nor of discontent, but it was turned mightily to generosity. And thinking: "Let all those who want, and who have not yet come, now arrive! Let all who come receive whate'er they want, and be filled with satisfaction!" it was on giving, ever and without end, that his mind was set. And on these ten conditions of heart, O king, was his mind too fixed--on self-control, and on inward calm, and on</P>
<P><A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A></P>
<P>long-suffering, and on self-restraint, and on temperance, and on voluntary subjugation to meritorious vows, and on freedom from all forms of wrath and cruelty, and on truthfulness, and on purity of heart. He had abandoned, O king, all seeking after the satisfaction of his animal lusts, he had overcome all craving after a future life, his strenuous effort was set only towards the higher life. He had given up, O king, the caring for himself, and devoted himself thenceforth to caring for others alone. His mind was fixed immovably on the thought: "How can I make all beings to be at peace, healthy, and wealthy, and long lived?" [<B>117</B>] And when, O king, he was giving things away, he gave not for the sake of rebirth in any glorious state, he gave not for the sake of wealth, nor of receiving gifts in return, nor of flattery, nor of long life for himself, nor of high birth, nor of happiness, nor of power, nor of fame, nor of offspring either of daughters or of sons--but it was for the sake of supreme wisdom and of the treasure thereof that he gave gifts so immense, so immeasurable, so unsurpassed. It was when he had attained to that supreme wisdom that he uttered the verse:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"<I>G</I>&acirc;li, my son, and the Black Antelope,<BR>
My daughter, and my queen, my wife, Madd&icirc;,<BR>
I gave them all away without a thought--<BR>

And at the raging of those winds, the waters little by little began to move, and at the movement of the waters the great fish and the scaly creatures were disturbed, and the waves began to roll in double breakers, and the beings that dwell in the waters were seized with fear and as the breakers rushed together in pairs the roar of the ocean grew loud, and the spray was lashed into fury, and garlands of foam arose, and the great ocean opened to its depths, and the waters rushed hither and thither, the furious crests of their waves meeting this way and that; and the Asuras, and Garu<I>l</I>as, and Yakkhas, and N&acirc;gas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> shook with fear, and thought in their alarm: "What now!

And as the water on which it rests&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> was troubled and agitated, then the broad earth began to shake, and with it the mountain ranges and the ocean depths, [<B>118</B>] and Sineru began to revolve, and its rocky mountain crest became twisted. And at the trembling of the earth, the serpents, and mungooses, and cats, and jackals, and boars, and deer, and birds became greatly distressed, and the Yakkhas of inferior power wept, while those of greater power were merry.</P>
<P>39.

Well spoken, venerable N&acirc;gasena. The doctrine of the Conqueror has been exalted, the perfection of the Conqueror has been glorified, the knot of the arguments of the adversaries has been unravelled, the jar of the theories of the opponents has been broken in pieces, the dilemma so profound has been made clear, the jungle has been turned into open country, the children of the Conqueror have received the desire of their hearts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_380"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

<P>his death, in response to the question put by Subhadda the recluse: "But if in this system the brethren live the perfect life, then the world would not be bereft of Arahats&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_394"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." This last phrase is absolute, inclusive; it cannot be explained away. If the first of these statements be correct, the second is misleading, if the second be right the first must be false. [<B>131</B>] This too is a double-pointed question, more confused than the jungle, more powerful than a strong man, more knotty than a knot. It is now put to you. Show the extent of the power of your knowledge, like a leviathan in the midst of the sea.'</P>
<P>56. 'The Blessed One, O king, did make both those statements you have quoted. But they are different one from the other both in the spirit and in the letter. The one deals with the limit of the duration of the doctrine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the other with the practice of a religious life--two things widely distinct, as far removed one from the other as the zenith is from the surface of the earth, as heaven is from purgatory, as good is from evil, and as pleasure is from pain. But though that be so, yet lest your enquiry should be vain, I will expound the matter further in its essential connection.'</P>
<P>57. 'When the Blessed One said that the good law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_388"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> would only endure for five hundred years, he said so declaring the time of its destruction, limiting the remainder of its existence. For he said: "The good law, &Acirc;nanda, would endure for a thousand years if no women had been admitted to the</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Order. But now, &Acirc;nanda, it will only last five hundred years." But in so saying, O king, did the Blessed One either foretell the disappearance of the good law, or throw blame on the clear understanding thereof?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Just so. It was a declaration of injury done, an announcement of the limit of what remained. As when a man whose income had been diminished might announce publicly, making sure of what remained: "So much property have I lost; so much is still left"--[<B>132</B>] so did the Blessed One make known to gods and men what remained when he announced what had been lost by saying: "The good law will now, &Acirc;nanda, endure for five hundred years." In so saying he was fixing a limit to religion. But when in speaking to Subhadda, and by way of proclaiming who were the true Sama<I>n</I>as, he said: "But if, in this system, the brethren live the perfect life, then the world would not be bereft of Arahats"--in so saying he was declaring in what religion consisted. You have confounded the limitation of a thing with the statement of what it is. But if you like I will tell you what the real connection between the two is. Listen carefully, and attend trustfully to what I say.'</P>
<P>58. 'Suppose, O king, there were a reservoir quite full of fresh cool water, overflowing at the brim, but limited in size and with an embankment running all round it. Now if, when the water had not abated in that tank, a mighty cloud were to rain down rain continually, and in addition, on to the water already in it, would the amount of water in the tank decrease or come to an end?'</P>
<P><A NAME="page_188"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 188</FONT></A></P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'But why not, O king?'</P>
<P>'Because of the Continual downpour of the rain.'</P>
<P>'Just so, O king, is the glorious reservoir of the good law of the teaching of the Conqueror ever full of the clear fresh cool water of the practice of duty and virtue and morality and purity of life, and continues overflowing all limits even to the very highest heaven of heavens. And if the children of the Buddha rain down into it continuously, and in addition, the rainfall of still further practice of duty and virtue and morality and purity of life, then will it endure for long, and the world will not be bereft of Arahats. This was the meaning of the Master's words when he said: "But if, Subhadda, in this system the brethren continue in perfectness of life, then will the world not be bereft of Arahats."'</P>
<P>59. 'Now suppose again, O king, that people were to continually supply a mighty fiery furnace with dried cow-dung, and dry sticks, and dry leaves--would that fire go out?'</P>
<P>[<B>133</B>] 'No indeed, Sir. Rather would it blaze more fiercely, and burn more brightly.'</P>
<P>'Just so, O king, does the glorious teaching of the Conqueror blaze and shine over the ten thousand world systems by the practice of duty and virtue and morality and purity of life. And if, O king, in addition to that, the children of the Buddha, devoting themselves to the five&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_389"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> kinds of spiritual exertion, continue zealous in effort--if cultivating a longing for the threefold discipline, they train themselves therein--</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_189"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 189</FONT></A></P>
<P>if without ceasing they carry out to the full the conduct that is right, and absolutely avoid all that is wrong, and practise righteousness of life--then will this glorious doctrine of the Conqueror stand more and more stedfast as the years roll on, and the world will not be bereft of Arahats. It was in reference to this, O king, that the Master spake when he said: "But if, Subhadda, in this system the brethren continue in perfectness of life, then will the world not be bereft of Arahats."'</P>
<P>60. 'Again, O king, suppose people were to continually polish with fine soft red powder a stainless mirror that was already bright and shining, well polished, smooth, and glossy, would dirt and dust and mud arise on its surface?'</P>
<P>'No indeed,--Sir. Rather would it become to a certainty even more stainless than before.'</P>
<P>'Just so, O king, is the glorious doctrine of the Conqueror stainless by nature, and altogether free from the dust and dirt of evil. And if the children of the Buddha cleanse it by the virtue arising from the shaking off, the eradication of evil, from the practice of duty and virtue and morality and purity of life, then will this glorious doctrine endure for long, and the world will not be bereft of Arahats. It was in reference to this that the Blessed One spake when he said: "But if, Subhadda, in this system the brethren continue in righteousness of life, then will not the world be bereft of Arahats." For the teaching of the Master, O king, has its root in conduct, has conduct as its essence, and stands fast so long as conduct does not decline&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_390"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</P>

<P>61. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, when you speak of the disappearance of the good law, what do you mean by its disappearance?'</P>
<P>'There are three modes of the disappearance, O king, of a system of doctrine. And what are the three? The decline of attainment to an intellectual grasp of it, the decline of conduct in accordance with it, and the decline of its outward form&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_399"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. [<B>134</B>] When the attainment of it ceases, then even the man who conducts himself aright in it has no clear understanding of it. By the decline of conduct the promulgation of the rules of discipline ceases, only the outward form of the religion remains. When the outward form has ceased, the succession of the tradition is cut off. These are the three forms of the disappearance of a system of doctrine.'</P>
<P>'You have well explained, venerable N&acirc;gasena, this dilemma so profound, and have made it plain. You have loosed the knot; you have destroyed the arguments of the adversary, broken them in pieces, proved them wrong--you, O best of the leaders of schools!'</P>

<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>62. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, had the Blessed One, when he became a Buddha, burnt out all evil in himself, or was there still some evil remaining in him?'</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_191"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 191</FONT></A></P>
<P>'He had burnt out all evil. There was none left.'</P>
<P>'But how, Sir? Did not the Tath&acirc;gata get hurt in his body?'</P>
<P>'Yes, O king. At R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha a splinter of rock pierced his foot&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_400"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and once he suffered from dysentery&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and once when the humours of his body were disturbed a purge was administered to him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_402"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and once when he was troubled with wind the Elder who waited on him (that is &Acirc;nanda) gave him hot water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_395"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.'</P>
<P>'Then, Sir, if the Tath&acirc;gata, on his becoming a Buddha, has destroyed all evil in himself--this other statement that his foot was pierced by a splinter, that he had dysentery, and so on, must be false. But if they are true, then he cannot have been free from evil, for there is no pain without Karma. All pain has its root in Karma, it is on account of Karma that suffering arises&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. This double-headed dilemma is put to you, and you have to solve it.'</P>
<P>63. 'No, O king. It is not all suffering that has its root in Karma. There are eight causes by which sufferings arise, by which many beings suffer pain. And what are the eight? Superabundance of wind, [<B>135</B>] and of bile, and of phlegm, the union of these humours, variations in temperature, the avoiding of</P>

<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_192"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 192</FONT></A></P>
<P>dissimilarities, external agency, and Karma. From each of these there are some sufferings that arise, and these are the eight causes by which many beings suffer pain. And therein whosoever maintains that it is Karma that injures beings, and besides it there is no other reason for pain, his proposition is false.'</P>
<P>'But, Sir, all the other seven kinds of pain have each of them also Karma as its origin, for they are all produced by Karma.'</P>
<P>'If, O king, all diseases were really derived from Karma then there would be no characteristic marks by which they could be distinguished one from the other. When the wind is disturbed, it is so in one or other of ten ways--by cold, or by heat, or by hunger, or by thirst, or by over eating, or by standing too long, or by over exertion, or by walking too fast, or by medical treatment, or as the result of Karma. Of these ten, nine do not act in a past life or in a future life, but in one's present existence. Therefore it is not right to say that all pain is due to Karma. When the bile, O king, is deranged it is so in one or other of three ways--by cold, or by heat, or by improper food. When the phlegm is disturbed it is so by cold, or by heat, or by food and drink. When either of these three humours are disturbed or mixed, it brings about its own special, distinctive pain. Then there are the special pains arising from variations in temperature, avoidance of dissimilarities, and external agency&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_405"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And there is the act that has Karma as its fruit, and the pain so brought about arising from the act done. So what</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_193"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 193</FONT></A></P>
<P>arises as the fruit of Karma is much less than that which arises from other causes. And the ignorant go too far [<B>136</B>] when they say that every pain is produced as the fruit of Karma. No one without a Buddha's insight can fix the extent of the action of Karma.'</P>
<P>64. 'Now when the Blessed One's foot was torn by a splinter of rock, the pain that followed was not produced by any other of the eight causes I have mentioned, but only by external agency. For Devadatta, O king, had harboured hatred against the Tath&acirc;gata during a succession of hundreds of thousands of births&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_406"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It was in his hatred that he seized hold of a mighty mass of rock, and pushed it over with the hope that it would fall upon his head. But two other rocks came together, and intercepted it before it had reached the Tath&acirc;gata; and by the force of their impact a splinter was torn off, and fell upon the Blessed One's foot, and made it bleed. Now this pain must have been produced in the Blessed One either as the result of his own Karma, or of some one else's act. For beyond these two there can be no other kind of pain. It is as when a seed does not germinate--that must be due either to the badness of the soil, or to a defect in the seed. Or it is as when food is not digested--that must be due either to a defect in the stomach, or to the badness of the food.'</P>
<P>65. 'But although the Blessed One never suffered pain which was the result of his own Karma, or brought about the avoidance of dissimilarity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_407"></A><A HREF="#fn_399"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, yet</P>
<P>

<P>he suffered pain from each of the other six causes. And by the pain he could suffer it was not possible to deprive him of life. There come to this body of ours, O king, compounded of the four elements&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_408"></A><A HREF="#fn_400"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, sensations desirable and the reverse, pleasant and unpleasant. Suppose, O king, a clod of earth were to be thrown into the air, and to fall again on to the ground. Would it be in consequence of any act it had previously done that it would so fall?'</P>
<P>'No, Sir. There is no reason in the broad earth by which it could experience the result of an act either good or evil. It would be by reason of a present cause [<B>137</B>] independent of Karma that the clod would fall to earth again.'</P>
<P>'Well, O king, the Tath&acirc;gata should be regarded as the broad earth. And as the clod would fall on it irrespective of any act done by it, so also was it irrespective of any act done by him that that splinter of rock fell upon his foot.'</P>
<P>66. 'Again, O king, men tear up and plough the earth. But is that a result of any act previously done?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Just so with the falling of that splinter. And the dysentery which attacked him was in the same way the result of no previous act, it arose from the union of the three humours. And whatsoever bodily disease fell upon him, that had its origin, not in Karma, but in one or other of the six causes referred to. For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One, by him who is above all gods, in the glorious collection called the Samyutta Nik&acirc;ya in</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_195"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 195</FONT></A></P>
<P>the prose Sutta, called after Moliya S&icirc;vaka: "There are certain pains which arise in the world, S&icirc;vaka, from bilious humour. And you ought to know for a certainty which those are, for it is a matter of common knowledge in the world which they are. But those Samanas and Brahmans, S&icirc;vaka, who are of the opinion and proclaim the view that whatsoever pleasure, or pain, or indifferent sensation, any man experiences, is always due to a previous act--they go beyond certainty, they go beyond knowledge, and therein do I say they are wrong. And so also of those pains which arise from the phlegmatic humour, or from the windy humour, or from the union of the three, or from variation in temperature, or from avoidance of dissimilarity, [<B>138</B>] or from external action, or as the result of Karma. In each case you should know for a certainty which those are, for it is a matter of common knowledge which they are. But those Samanas or Brahmans who are of the opinion or the view that whatsoever pleasure, or pain, or indifferent sensation, any man may experience, that is always due to a previous act--they go beyond certainty, they go beyond common knowledge. And therein do I say they are wrong." So, O king, it is not all pain that is the result of Karma. And you should accept as a fact that when the Blessed One became a Buddha he had burnt out all evil from within him.'</P>

'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, your people say that everything which a Tath&acirc;gata has to accomplish that had the Blessed One already carried out when he sat at the foot of the Tree of Wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_410"></A><A HREF="#fn_402"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. There was then nothing that he had yet to do, nothing that he had to add to what he had already done.

If the first statement be correct, then the second must be false. And if the second be right, then the first must be wrong. There is no need of any contemplation to him who has already accomplished his task. It is the man who still has something left to do, who has to think about it. [<B>139</B>] It is the sick man who has need of medicine, not the healthy; the hungry man who has need of food, not the man whose hunger is quenched.

And they did so in the same way as a man who had received high office from a king would, in the recollection of its advantages, of the prosperity he enjoyed by means of it, remain constantly in attendance on that king--in the same way as a man who, having been afflicted and pained with a dire disease, and having recovered his health by the use of medicine, would use the same medicine again and again, calling to mind its virtue.'</P>
<P>69. 'And there are, O king, these twenty and eight good qualities of meditation in the perception of which the Tath&acirc;gatas devoted themselves to it. And which are they? Meditation preserves him who meditates, it gives him long life, and endows him with power, it cleanses him from faults, it removes from him any bad reputation giving him a good name, it destroys discontent in him filling him with content, it releases him from all fear endowing him with confidence, it removes sloth far from him filling him with zeal, it takes away lust and ill-will and dullness, it puts an end to pride, it breaks down all doubt, it makes his heart to be at peace, it softens his mind, [<B>140</B>] it makes him glad, it makes him grave, it gains him much advantage, it makes him worthy of reverence, it fills him with joy, it fills him with delight, it shows him the transitory nature of all compounded things, it puts an end to rebirth, it obtains for him all the benefits of renunciation. These, O king, are the twenty and eight virtues of meditation on the perception of which the Tath&acirc;gatas devote themselves to it. But it is because</P>
<P><A NAME="page_198"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 198</FONT></A></P>
<P>the Tath&acirc;gatas, O king, long for the enjoyment of the bliss of attainment, of the joy of the tranquil state of Nirv&acirc;na, that they devote themselves to meditation, with their minds fixed on the end they aim at.</P>
<P>70. 'And there are four, reasons for which the Tath&acirc;gatas, O king, devote themselves to meditation. And what are the four? That they may dwell at ease, O king--and on account of the abundance of the advantages of meditation, advantages without drawback--and on account of its being the road to all noble things without exception-and because it has been praised and lauded and exalted and magnified by all the Buddhas. These are the reasons for which the Tath&acirc;gatas devote themselves to it. So it is not, great king, because they have anything left to do, or anything to add to what they have already accomplished, but because they have perceived how diversified are the advantages it possesses, that they devote themselves to meditation.'</P>

<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>71. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, it has been said by the Blessed One: "The Tath&acirc;gata, &Acirc;nanda, has thought out and thoroughly practised, developed, accumulated, and ascended to the very height of the four paths to saintship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_412"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and so mastered them as to be able to use them as a means of mental advancement, and as a basis for edification--and he therefore, &Acirc;nanda,</P>

And again he said: "At the end of three months from this time the Tath&acirc;gata will die&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_414"></A><A HREF="#fn_406"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>." If the first of these statements were true, then the limit of three months must have been false. If the second were true, [<B>141</B>] then the first must have been false. For the Tath&acirc;gatas boast not without an occasion, the Blessed Buddhas speak no misleading words, but they utter truth, and speak sincerely. This too is a double-headed dilemma, profound, subtle, hard to expound. It is now put to you. Tear in sunder this net of heresy, put it on one side, break in pieces the arguments of the adversary!'</P>
<P>72. 'Both these statements, O king, were made by the Blessed One. But Kalpa in that connection means the duration of a man's life. And the Blessed One, O king, was not exalting his own power when he said so, but he was exalting the power of Saintship. It was as if a king were possessed of a horse most swift of foot, who could run like the wind. And in order to exalt the power of his speed the king were to say in the presence of all his court-townsfolk and country folk, hired servants and men of war, brahmins, nobles, and officers: "If he wished it this noble steed of mine could cross the earth to its ocean boundary, and be back here again, in a moment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_415"></A><A HREF="#fn_407"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!"</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Now though he did not try to test the horse's speed in the presence of the court, yet it had that speed, and was, really able to go along over the earth to its ocean boundary in a moment. Just so, O king, the Blessed One spake as he did in praise of the power of saintship, and so spake seated in the midst of gods and men, and of the men of the threefold wisdom and the sixfold insight--the Arahats pure and free from stain--when he said: "The Tath&acirc;gata, &Acirc;nanda, has thought out and practised, developed, accumulated, and ascended to the very height of the four powers of saintship, and so mastered them as to be able to use them as a means of mental advancement, as a basis for edification. And he therefore, &Acirc;nanda, should he desire it, might remain alive for a Kalpa, or the part of a Kalpa that has yet to run." And there was that power, O king, in the Tath&acirc;gata, he could have remained alive for that time: and yet he did not show that power in the midst [<B>142</B>] of that assembly. The Blessed One, O king, is free from desire as respects all conditions of future life, and has condemned them all. For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One: "Just, O Bhikkhus, as a very small quantity of excrement is of evil smell, so do I find no beauty in the very smallest degree of future life, not even in such for the time of the snapping of the fingers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_416"></A><A HREF="#fn_408"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."

The exact time at which it was introduced into Buddhism is as yet unknown. It has not been found in the Pi<I>t</I>akas themselves, and is probably an incorporation of an older, pre-Buddhistic, belief. The person carrying it out is supposed to have some goodness, to call that virtue (and perhaps, as in the case of the quail, the goodness of the Buddhas also) to mind, and then to wish something, and that thing, however difficult, and provided there is nothing cruel in it, then comes to pass. It is analogous to the mystic power supposed to reside in names. Childers very properly points out that we have a very remarkable instance of an Act of Truth (though a very un-Buddhistic one) in the Hebrew book of the Kings II. i. 10. 'And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty: "If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty!" And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.' A great point, both in this legend and in the story of the quail, is that the power of nature to be overcome is one looked upon by the Brahmans as divine.</P>

Even in the later orthodox literature the period of meditation is still not three months, but only seven times seven days. See the passages quoted in Professor Oldenberg's note at p. 75 of the 'Vinaya Texts,' vol. i.</P>
