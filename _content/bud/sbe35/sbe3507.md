### BOOK II. CHAPTER 3.

15\. The king said: 'When those conditions (whose marks you have just
specified) have run together, is it possible, by bending them apart one
to one side and one to the other <span id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_234),
to make the distinction between them clear, so that one can say:,' This
is contact, and this sensation, and this idea, and this intention, and
this perception, and this reflection, and this investigation <span
id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_235)"?'

'No: that cannot be done.'

'Give me an illustration.'

'Suppose, O king, the cook in the royal household were to make a syrup
or a sauce, and were to put into it curds, and salt, and ginger, and
cummin seed <span id="fr_240"></span>[3](#fn_236), and pepper, and other
ingredients. And suppose the king were to say to him: "Pick out for me
the flavour of the curds, and of the salt, and of the ginger, and of the
cummin seed, and of the pepper, and of all the things you have put into
it." Now would it be possible, great king, separating off one from
another those flavours that had thus run together, to pick out each one,
so that one could say: "Here is the sourness, and here the saltness, and
here the pungency, and here the acidity, and here the astringency, and
here the sweetness <span id="fr_241"></span>[4](#fn_237)"?'

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

'No, that would not be possible \[**64**\]. But each flavour would
nevertheless be distinctly present by its characteristic sign.'

'And just so, great king, with respect to those conditions we were
discussing.'

'Very good, Nâgasena!'

16\. The Elder said: 'Is salt, O king, recognisable by the eye?'

'Yes, Sir, it is.'

'But be careful, O king.'

'Well then, Sir, is it perceptible by the tongue?'

'Yes, that is right.'

'But, Sir, is it only by the tongue that every kind of salt is
distinguished?'

'Yes, every kind.'

'If that be so, Sir, why do bullocks bring whole cart-loads of it? Is it
not salt and nothing else that ought to be so brought?'

'It is impossible to bring salt by itself. But all these
conditions <span id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_238) have run together into
one, and produced the distinctive thing called salt <span
id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_239). (For instance): salt is heavy, too. But
is it possible, O king, to weigh salt?'

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

'Certainly, Sir.'

Nay, great king, it is not the salt you weigh, it is the weight.'

'You are ready, Nâgasena, in argument.'

Here ends the questioning of Nâgasena by Milinda <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_234"></span>[97:1](sbe3507.htm#fr_238)
Vinibbhu*g*itvâ vinibbhu*g*itvâ. This question is identical with the one
asked of the Buddha at Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya 43, p. 293. Compare also p. 233
and Tela Ka*t*âha Gâthâ 59.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[97:2](sbe3507.htm#fr_239) This list differs
from that in II, 3, 8, by the addition of vi*ññ*â*n*a.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[97:3](sbe3507.htm#fr_240) *G*îraka. Compare
*G*âtaka I, 244; II, 181, 363. Hîna*t*i-kumburê translates it by duru,
and Hardy by "onions' (p. 439).

<span id="fn_237"></span>[97:4](sbe3507.htm#fr_241) This is the same
list as is found above, II, 3, 6; and below, III, 4, 2, and the items
are not intended to correspond with the condiments in the list above.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[98:1](sbe3507.htm#fr_242) Not saltness only,
but white colour, &c. &c.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[98:2](sbe3507.htm#fr_243) He means the king to
draw the conclusion that that distinct thing is only recognisable by the
tongue; so the senses are not interchangeable. In other words it is true
that salt seems to be recognised by the sight, as when people load it
into carts they do not stop to taste it. But what they see is not salt,
what they weigh is not salt, it is whiteness and weight. And the fact of
its being salt is an inference they draw. So, great king, your simile of
the soul being inside the body, and using the five senses, as a man
inside a house uses windows, does not hold good. See the conclusion
above of II, 3, 6, [p. 88](sbe3506.htm#page_88).

<span id="fn_240"></span>[99:1](sbe3507.htm#fr_244) This is again most
odd. One would expect, 'Here ends the questioning as to characteristic
signs.' See the note at the end of last chapter.
