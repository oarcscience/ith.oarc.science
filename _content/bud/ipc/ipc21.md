### CHAPTER XVIII

#### OPHIS AND THE SERPENTS

<span class="small">[Serpent](errata.htm#36) symbol everywhere in
S’iva-Buddhism—Unknown in early Buddhism—Legend of Buddha burning the
palace of the Naga king—On a bas relief of the Sanchi Tope—The Serpent
and the Lotus leaf—Valentinus—Dhyâni Buddhas—Saktis or Wives of the

and Serpent Worship—The Gnostic Kristos a Serpent—Cainites and
Naasseni—The "Thousand-eyed (Dasasatanayana)" in Alexandria.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> S’iva-Buddhism the serpent symbol is
everywhere; on the miniature Chaitya-domes, on the heads of Buddha, in
all the temple sculptures, on the altar. It is a striking and immensely
important fact that on the early topes, Sanchi and Bharhut, there is no
Serpent worship. One exception is noticed in Mr. Fergusson's Tree and
Serpent Worship. I reproduce it. ([Pl. 25](#img_pl25)). This bas relief
is to be seen at Sanchi. Sir Alexander Cunningham denies that it is
Serpent worship, but Mr. Fergusson points to the altar, and he makes one
very noticeable observation. The worshippers are not like the other
Buddhists of the sculptures. They have different dresses and different
caps. Mr. Fergusson calls them Dasyus.

I think if these writers had come across the legend of the burning of
the palace called Nangewenodenneye in the Cingalese records, their
conclusions would not have been antagonistic. I have given this story

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

already. Buddha visits Samana Deva Rajah in his palace in hell. He
frightens all his Nâgas to death by making fire issue from four sides of
the palace. The Nâgas are the ancient rulers of Ceylon, and the Nâgas
are to this day a sect of S’iva. Probably in early times it was a
generic title. The five-headed serpent ([Pl. 25](#img_pl25)) is the
Serpent King, with his fire altar and crowd of bullocks and other
victims, which include I fear, two little boys. There is wood piled, and
a second brazier is in the corner. Buddha's object, we must recollect,
was to secure the Minne Phalange, or "Seat of Supremacy." In one corner
of the Plate is Buddha working his magic under a Pan-sil. The Kûsa grass
mat of the ascetic was called the Throne of the Bodhi (Bodhi mandi).

The Fourth Gospel is judged by scholars to be much more recent than the
other three. Irenæus calls it the Gospel used by Valentinus and his
followers. He tells us that there were four Gospels used by the church;
Matthew's, which was the Gospel used by the Ebionites; Mark's, the
Gospel used by the Docetæ; Luke's, the Gospel used by the Marcionites;
and John's, the Gospel used by the Valentians! Does this mean that each
of the four principal sects had a version of the early Gospel, the
"Gospel according to the Hebrews," and that these were each altered by
them to suit their teachings?

Valentinus is placed by Matter at the head of the Gnostics. <span
id="fr_289"></span>[\*](#fn_287) He became prominent in the Church about
A.D. 136 on the death of Basilides. <span
id="fr_290"></span>[†](#fn_288)

In our last chapter we dealt with the distinction drawn by the Gnostics
between the visible and invisible portions of the universe. Valentinus
seems to have gone beyond Basilides, he made Buthos (the unmanifested

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

portion) into a God. Now one section of the Indian Swâbhâvikas also
worshipped a space turned into a God. The Prâjnikas, says Hodgson, made
Nirvritti into a God. And the other section of the Swâbhâvikas went
nearly as far. There was nothing, they said, but matter. It was called
Swayambhu (the Self-existent).

The Mortal Buddhas who ruled this space in S’iva-Buddhism, were changed
into Dhyâni Buddhas, that is, Buddhas that have never lived on earth at
all. This was, of course, nonsensical, but the strict pantheism of the
second school required all divine beings to descend in an unbroken chain
from Îs’wara. Valentinus took over these Dhyâni Buddhas, and called them
Æons (Eternals). With both they were "virtues," "powers," "emanations."
Also they increased and multiplied like mortals, for each had his sakti,
or female energy.

I will give the names of the Five Dhyâni Buddhas. They helped
[Îs’wara](errata.htm#37) to build up the universe.

Tertullian attacks these emanations of Valentinus, and their
ever-increasing list, in the writings of Secundus and Marcus. He derides
their "Fraternal nuptials," <span id="fr_291"></span>[\*](#fn_289) and
their "conjunctions of execrable and unseen embraces"; and he makes much
fun of the changes in conditions and alterations of domicile of the
various beings, human and divine, at the end of an age—Achamoth restored
to the Pleroma; the "Demiurge" promoted from the celestial Hebdomad to
the higher regions"; and the just of the earth dispersed amongst the
angels"—without anyone being allowed to carry away any of the matter of
the earth for a body. <span id="fr_292"></span>[†](#fn_290) Does he not
picture here the constant shuffling of cards in the Ceylon Pantheon, and
remind us that in the Mahayana there are at least seventeen distinct
Devas who each created the world? "With humorous irony," as the two
clerical translators put it, Tertullian describes how a "wonderful
puppet," Soter (the Saviour) is formed out of these Gnostic emanations,
although St. Paul practically says the same thing. Tertullian specially
attacks the gross deeds of "Sophia" and "Achamoth" called "left-handed"
deities <span id="fr_293"></span>[‡](#fn_291) he tells us. Noteworthy is
the fact that with these Gnostics Soter the Saviour had three natures:
the carnal or left-handed; the right-handed

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

balanced between the carnal and spiritual; and third, the
spiritual. <span id="fr_294"></span>[\*](#fn_292) This seems to show
that the [differentiation](errata.htm#38) between the active god and the
Unmanifested Supreme, or as Tertullian puts it, the "placid" and
"stupid" divinity, <span id="fr_295"></span>[†](#fn_293) was not as
closely insisted on as it is now. Padmapani wears his mask loosely, and
allows Trailinga Î'shwara's head to peep out. Serapis was also called
Soter.

Although the Buddhists and Gnostics differ in the choice of the virtues
and qualities with which they christen their Æons and Buddhas, the
analogy between them is sufficiently close.

Is there anything like all this in the Gospel that, according to
Irenæus, was viewed at one time as the Gospel of Valentinus.

"No man hath seen God at any time. Monogenes, who is in the bosom of
Propator, he hath declared him" (John i. i8).

Propator is "The Father" of the Fourth Gospel, and according to Matter,
Proarche (the Beginning) is another name for him. Then we see that
Monogenes made the world (John i. 3). He is the Phos, who lights up the
Pleroma, as Padmapani lights up the Pravritti (John viii. 12). And the
names of other Æons, Zoe, Aletheia, Logos, Ecclesia, figure in the
narrative.

Now this seems the teaching of Valentinus in epitome, <span
id="fr_296"></span>[‡](#fn_294) but here comes a bewilderment: Neander
calls St. John's Gospel an attack on the Gnostics.

This is a little remarkable. According to Irenæus, Valentinus at one
time believed that this gospel set forth his philosophy and teaching,
and yet at a subsequent time a writer, not without shrewdness,

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

can see nothing in the gospel but a fierce attack on Valentinus. It
seems plain that these two observers cannot have seen the same
document—or at any rate, the same document in the same condition.

Did Valentinus know anything of Serpent-Worship?

Irenæus declares that he held that the mighty Sophia, the Dharma, the
Wisdom of the Gnostics had for mother the Serpent Ennoia, and for father
Buthos, the void.

Ennoia brought forth two emanations—one perfect, the Christos, the other
imperfect, Sophia Achemoth. She descending into Chaos lost her way, and
became ambitious to create a world entirely for herself.

Sophia, as I have said, parented Ialdabaoth, and Ialdabaoth parented
Ophiomorphus, who had six sons:—Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloi, Oraios,
Aslaphaios, Iao.

"Ophis," says Matter, "was at once with the Ophites both Satan and
Christos." <span id="fr_297"></span>[\*](#fn_295) The Pneumatics cited
John iii. 14, 15, to prove the identity of the Saviour and the Serpent
Ophis. <span id="fr_298"></span>[†](#fn_296) "Serpentem magnificant
intantum ut ilium etiam Christo prœferant," says Tertullian. <span
id="fr_299"></span>[‡](#fn_297) The Ophites outdid the serpent petting
of Nâgpur in India:—

"They bred in their sanctuaries living serpents, and these were so
trained that during the celebration of the Holy Communion these
creatures issued from their cages, and came and "blessed" (by licking
it) the consecrated bread exposed on the holy table." <span
id="fr_300"></span>[§](#fn_298) When the Ophites and Marcionites joined
forces, and no live serpents were available, they had to be content,
according to Theodoret, with a brass serpent in their churches. <span
id="fr_301"></span>[+](#fn_299)

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

Amongst the Gnostics there was a good serpent and also a wicked serpent.
The Sethians and Paratæ worshipped a good Serpent. The Cainites
worshipped an evil Serpent, and so did the Ophites, according to Matter,
but Hippolytus identifies the latter with the Naasseni who professed to
have received their teaching from James, the brother of the Lord. They
held that "Jesus" represented three principles, the angelic, the
psychical and the earthly, in fact that he was apparently Trailinga
Î'shwara. Here is another curious point. According to Hippolytus the
Naasseni and Phrygians called the Father "the many named, thousand eyed,
Incomprehensible." <span id="fr_302"></span>[\*](#fn_300) Here we have
Dasasatanayana's name literally translated. S’iva as Sesh is the
"thousand-eyed" (Dasasatanayana).

Here is a passage in a hymn of the Naasseni:—

"Evoe, evan! Thou art Pan as thou art Bacchus, as thou art Shepherd of
brilliant stars." <span id="fr_303"></span>[†](#fn_301)

The Shepherd of the brilliant stars must be S’iva as Sesha, the shepherd
of the spangled serpents in the sky.

Also S’iva is the Bacchus and Pan of the Greeks.
