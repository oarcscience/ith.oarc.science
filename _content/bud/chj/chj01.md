### PREFACE

<span class="smallcaps">I can</span> only plead for my book that it is
the work of a pioneer, and every pioneer knows that his labours must
necessarily be crude and imperfect. I foresee all the strictures that
criticism will pass upon my labours, and shall be more than content if
what I have written stimulates others to further research.

More should have been said about the lives and teachings of Hōnen,
Shinran, and other leaders of the Jōdo or Pure Land sects. The omission
is due to the fact that I have already dealt with these thinkers in a
monograph entitled "Shinran and His Work," which I published in Tokyo
last year. Even with these omissions I fear this book will seem rather
bulky.

My best thanks are due to the Master of Peterhouse, who has put himself
to much trouble on my behalf.

A. LLOYD.
