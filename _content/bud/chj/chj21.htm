<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Buddhism during the Nara Period</span>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">from A.D. 621&#8211;782</span></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> activities of Kumaraj&#299;va seem to have led to the dismemberment of the Mah&#257;y&#257;na, which, in spite of the variety of doctrines it contained within its ample folds, had hitherto contrived to preserve a united front. The sectarianism of Chinese Buddhism was aided by the distracted state of the Chinese Empire, broken up into many kingdoms, each striving for the mastery; and we have seen some of these rival states casting about for supporters, and trying to enlist sympathy for themselves in the Korean peninsula and in Japan. We have seen Korea similarly divided into warring kingdoms, some of which&#8212;Kudara and Mim&#257;na&#8212;looked to Japan for aid, while Shiragi, relying on Chinese support from the kingdom of the Wei, boldly resisted Japanese intervention; and Koma, too weak for independent action, sat on a fence and vacillated between Japan and Shiragi, according to the interests of the hour. And, lastly, we have seen Japan under Sh&#333;toku Taishi gradually inclining more and more towards a following of China, and taking the Empire of the Sui (590&#8211;618) as its model, both in religion and in secular politics.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="green">p. 192</font></A></p>  
<p>Sh&#333;toku died in 621. Three years before his death, the dynasty of the Sui, in China, with its costly ambition and magnificence, had been obliged to make way for the family of the Tangs, who ruled till 907, and who inaugurated a period of greatness and prosperity such as China had not known since the downfall of the great House of Han in 220 A.D.</p>  
<p>The Tangs began badly for Buddhism. Kaotsu (618&#8211;627), their first ruler, broke up Buddhist monasteries right and left, and sent 100,000 bonzes back to lay life where they would be obliged to work, and neither his successor Taitsung nor his wife Ch&#8217;angsun&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> had any sympathies for the faith. But the Buddhists knew how to win their way back to favour in the course of a few years, and the Tangs had not been fifty years on the throne in China ere Buddhism was once more in full force, and on a far more splendid basis than before. Under the Tangs it became essentially a Chinese faith; it had, as it were, discarded its Indian waistcloth and adopted the flowing robes of the Celestial.</p>  
<p>In the selfsame year that Sh&#333;toku Taishi died, there was erected at Singanfu, at that time the capital, the first Zoroastrian temple ever built in China. The Tangs had owed very much to the support of the Turkish tribes on the western frontier of China in the days when they were busy winning their crown, and it was probably due to this</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="green">p. 193</font></A></p>  
<p>connection between the Empire and the tribes on its borders that the Magians took the opportunity of preaching in China itself. Singanfu, which lies in the province of Shensi, is not far removed from the then abodes of the Turkish tribes; indeed, it was once suggested to Kaotsu, by some pusillanimous advisers, that he should remove his capital to some safer spot in the province of Honan, where he would be free from the danger of incursions from the barbarians.</p>  
<p>The year of Sh&#333;toku's death was also the year of the Hejirah, the year in which Mohammed fled to Medina and announced his divine mission to the astonished world. Ten years later, Izdegerd, King of Persia, was fighting for his very existence against the victorious Arabs who had gone forth conquering and to conquer, and by the year 640 the whole of Persia, with Merv, Balkh, Herat, everything as far as the Indus and the Oxus, had submitted to the sword of the new-born enthusiasm. That Persia, in the pangs of her last crisis, appealed to China for help is known. After Izdegerd's death in 651, his son fled into Turkestan, from whence he made his way to China. He succeeded in persuading the Chinese to take over the administration of the whole country between their frontier and that of the Arabs, and it was as Chinese Viceroy of that district that he was attacked and defeated by the Arabs in 670, and obliged once more to flee to Singanfu.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Was it chance, or was it the design of Heaven, that, in the year 636, shortly after Izdegerd had entered upon his last fatal war against the Arabs, there arrived in Singanfu a Christian mission hailing from Persia?</p>  
<p>When the Nestorian protest against the use of the word Theotokos as applied to the mother of Our Lord</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="green">p. 194</font></A></p>  
<p>had been condemned by the Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431, the followers of Nestorius, finding themselves liable to unjust persecution in the Roman Empire, withdrew into Persia, where they were well received, and enabled to establish flourishing communities, not only in Persia, but in Balkh, Merv, Central Asia, and India. They were loyal to the country of their adoption, as well they might be; that country was now in distress, and was looking to China for help; a Christian mission in China might be productive of much good, both spiritually and politically. The mission was, therefore, sent;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> it arrived at Singanfu in 636, and was well received by the Emperor and his successors, some of whom issued edicts in favour of the faith, or gave money for building "temples of felicity," as they were called, whilst one went so far in his patronage that,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></A></p>  
<p>without becoming a Christian, he would still keep the Christmas festival with his Nestorian subjects. There were times of persecution, to be sure; but the Nestorian missions survived them all. In the year 1293 the Franciscans under John of Montecorvino arrived at Peking, and found the Nestorians in full force; in 1304, the Nestorian Patriarch of Baghdad, the head of the whole Nestorian Church, submitted himself to Rome, and the Chinese Nestorians seem to have thought it best to follow his example. In 1305, John de Montecorvino reported very large accessions to his flock, and the Nestorians of China disappear from history.</p>  
<p>There was also in Singanfu and its neighbourhood the zeal of Buddhism, aroused by the sense of its new dangers. The luxury of the Sui, and of many of the sovereigns of the illegitimate states, had been suffered by the Buddhists to go unreproved. Nay, they had profited by the distractions and evils of the times, and had secured for themselves wealth, position, and exemptions from taxation as the price of the support they gave to luxurious and ambitious princes. All these things had brought upon them the hatred and contempt of the lettered classes, and the undisguised hostility of powerful sovereigns, like Kaotsung and others, must have warned them to set their house in order if they would continue in their former prosperity. We can see many signs of this movement of reform produced by fear. The new school of translation inaugurated by Kumaraj&#299;va, the suggested amalgamation of Buddhism with Taoism, the new revelations (for they amounted to that) of the Hoss&#333; and the Kegon, and the wide-embracing system inaugurated by Chisha Daishi of the Tendai, all point to the same conclusion.</p>  
<p>Bodhidharma and Zend&#333;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> alone aimed at simplification,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></A></p>  
<p>but the former was not represented at the capital of the Sui and Tang. Zend&#333;, however, was there, and his preaching of salvation by faith was welcomed by the poor. He was the popular preacher of the hour, and the popularity of his preaching drew upon him the hostility of the other sects. Tendai, Hoss&#333;, Kegon have always been the enemies of the simple faith preached by Zend&#333;. They have always treated it as something alien to Buddhism, and so perhaps it was. At any rate, there it was in Singanfu, side by side with many alien faiths, during that momentous half-century which meant so very much for the religious development of the Far East.</p>  
<p>It was probably about this time also that the Manich&aelig;an missions reached China proper. They had long ere this time been in the Turfan and Khotan districts, but probably never reached China itself until the time of the Tangs. The recent discoveries of German and other explorers are likely in a short time to add so much to our knowledge of Manich&aelig;ism that it is not worth while here to dilate upon the subject. Let us content ourselves with noting that Manich&aelig;ism was in China, and was one of the rivals of Buddhism.</p>  
<p>Magians, Christians, Manich&aelig;ans, three rivals, and the old enemies to boot, Confucianism and Taoism. With Kaotsu and Taitsung on the throne of the united empire, and putting down Buddhist monasteries with a strong hand, things looked very dark indeed for the Chinese Mah&#257;y&#257;na. Hiouen Thsang was the man who saved it in this crisis. Born in 602, and admitted to the priesthood in 622, Hiouen Thsang determined to travel to India and collect accurate information and materials from the original home of Buddhism for the defence of the faith which he saw threatened from within and from without. It is quite possible that he mistrusted the Central Asian traditions.</p>  
<p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Starting in 629, he made a tour of such Buddhist countries in Central Asia as had not yet fallen a prey to the Arabs, and in India, where he was royally treated by the great king Siladitya Harsha, one of the last of its Buddhist sovereigns. When he returned to China, the movement hostile to Buddhism had for the time spent its strength, and when, about 646, he published translations of some of the new books he had brought with him, the Emperor himself deigned to write a preface.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Hiouen Thsang, the Max M&uuml;ller of his day, was in direct relations with Japan. In 655, about the time of the accession of the Empress Saimei, a priest from Kawachi, a S&#333;zu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of the name of D&#333;s&#333;, went over to China with the ambassadors sent to announce the new sovereign's accession, and there, meeting with Hiouen Thsang, learnt from him the Hoss&#333; or Dharma-lakshana doctrines, which the great doctor was preaching. Five years later, in the same reign, two more priests, Chits&#363; and Chitatsu, crossed to China in a ship of Shiragi, and were initiated into the Hoss&#333; mysteries by Hiouen Thsang and his coadjutor Jion daishi. In the third year of Taih&#333; (704), another batch of these priests went to China, armed with letters from their sovereign, and studied the doctrines</p>

<p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></A></p>  
<p>of the Unity (<i>Yuishiki</i>) under Chish&#333; Daishi. Thus three&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> distinct strains of Hoss&#333; teachings came to Japan, and blended there, and though the Hoss&#333; sect, qua sect, disappeared shortly after the close of the Nara age, it left permanent traces in the religious history of the country. For D&#333;s&#333; and Chitatsu had as their principal disciple the celebrated Gy&#333;gi Bosatsu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to whom is attributed the invention of the Ry&#333;bu Shint&#333;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> which made it possible for Buddhism to strike deep roots in the religious consciousness of Japan.</p>  
<p>If we trace back this teaching to its earliest origin we shall see what it meant, and how powerfully it was likely to affect the situation in Japan. We shall also see, incidentally, how far the Mah&#257;y&#257;na had by this time travelled from the simplicity of S&#8217;akyamuni's teachings.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></A></p>  
<p>The Hoss&#333; sect traced itself back to the brothers Asangha and Vasubandhu, whom we may place at the beginning of the fourth century A.D. It was an age of syncretism and eclecticism. Mani, the founder of Manich&aelig;ism, had already worked out his great religion, which was destined to spread so widely and to have so extended and varied an influence, and Mani had laboured in India, as well as studied in Alexandria and Babylon. The Buddhists in India, hard pressed by the arguments of Hindu philosophers, such as the doughty Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya, were casting about for new ways of putting their principles before the Hindu world. The Dharmalakshana or Hoss&#333; teachings of Asangha and Vasubandhu were intended to build a bridge between Hinduism and the Mah&#257;y&#257;na, of such a nature that the Buddhist might, as it were, invade the territory of Hinduism and conquer without seeming to do so.</p>  
<p>The teaching was based, as I have said, on a revelation or quasi-revelation. Whilst Asangha was lecturing in Ayodhya, the present Oude, in India, he received a heavenly visitor, the great Bodhisattva Maitreya,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the disciple of S&#8217;akyamuni, who had received the promise of becoming the future Saviour of the world, and who was waiting in the celestial regions for the fulness of the times to come. Maitreya, appearing in the lecture hall, expounded for Asangha a secret and mysterious doctrine which he had been commissioned to deliver. He had come from a Buddha greater and wiser than S&#8217;akyamuni, from the great Buddha <i>Loc&#8217;ana</i>, or <i>Roshana</i>, whose colossal statue is now known as the Daibutsu of Nara, and who is not to be confounded with the Vairoc&#8217;ana of the Shingon sect, introduced later by the Kegon doctors and Kob&#333;daishi;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="green">p. 200</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Roshana, said Maitreya, was the Supreme Being, invisible but all-powerful. When He showed Himself upon earth, it was through the personality of two great spiritual Beings, Maitreya Himself, and Manju&#347;ri, the potent Bodhisattva of China.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>One of the keynotes of the Hoss&#333; teaching (it would require a large volume to describe it all) is the doctrine of Oneness from which the other name of the sect, the <i>Yuishikiky&#333;</i>, or Oneness sect, is derived. A Christian would say, "God is One, and besides Him there is none other." But the Hoss&#333; sect (if we may use the word "God" for Buddhist speculations) would put it a little otherwise. "God is One, and besides Him there is nothing." The Universe, or God (for the two were treated as identical) was looked upon as a mighty ocean, unfathomable and unlimited, and the phenomena of nature and life, trees and plants, birds and beasts, sun and stars, men, angels, and even the gods whom men worshipped, were but the waves which appear for a moment on the surface, vanish, and reappear in a different shape. The wave I look at now is but a rearrangement of the drops in the wave which appeared in a different shape in another part of the bay. The god I worship now, on the Himalaya slopes, I call by the name of S&#8217;akyamuni; rearrange the particles that compose him, and he will appear presently on the plains of the Ganges as the Hindu Vishnu. The name and the form have been changed, the essence which is a part of the great Ocean of the Universe, which is God, is unchanged, and remains identically the same. Thus it came in India that men passed from one cult to</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="green">p. 201</font></A></p>  
<p>the other, and that the Hindus, to this day, look upon S&#8217;akyamuni as one incarnation of their god Vishnu.</p>  
<p>This was the doctrine which enabled Gy&#333;gi Bosatsu, and other leading priests of the Nara period, to propound the doctrine of Ry&#333;bu-Shinto (or <i>Ry&#333;bu-Bukky&#333;</i>, as it is also called). According to this doctrine, the ancient gods of Japan, Amaterasu, the goddess of the Sun, and the other divinities whom the Japanese had brought from their unknown original homes on the continent of Asia, were not independent spiritual Beings, but merely fresh incarnations of that same divine Essence which had moved for a while on the surface of things, as this or that one of the great Bodhisattvas and Buddhas of the Indian religion. Buddhism had not come to destroy the faith of Japan, but to strengthen it with the additional light that was shining forth from India and China. How far the movement was a popular one, may be doubted. The common people counted for very little in those days; it was an oracle, issuing from the Temple at Is&eacute;, that authoritatively proclaimed the identity of Amaterasu and Vairoc&#8217;ana.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> A few years before, in the year 616, the great god of Miwa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> had very obligingly let it be known throughout Japan that the proper ministers to take charge of funeral rites were the Buddhist clergy.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_251"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> This amounted practically to an endowment of Buddhism.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></A></p>  
<p>Another sect which made its appearance in Japan during the Nara period was the Kegon, or Avata&#7747;saka sect, which was introduced in 736. It was one of purely Chinese origin, though the books on which it was based came originally from India, and had been founded at the end of the Sui and beginning of the Tang dynasties, between 600 and 660, by a priest whose name the Japanese pronounce as Tojun (<A NAME="img_20200"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/20200.jpg">). It represented, when it arose, one of the latest developments of Chinese Buddhist thought (it came into prominence a little after the Hoss&#333;). The Japanese have always wanted to have the very latest in every department of human thought.</p>  
<p>Like the Hoss&#333;, the Kegon went back for its origin to the very beginnings of the Mah&#257;y&#257;na. When N&#257;g&#257;rjuna, in his wanderings, had reached the Himalayas, he was taken to the Dragon Palace under the Sea, out of which he fetched the wonderful book known as the Avatamsaka S&#363;tra,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_254"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> which was to form the basis of the new sect. It is a very difficult book, and very long: many translators in earlier times had tried their hands at it, but had only produced fragmentary versions of individual chapters.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_255"></A><A HREF="#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Now at last, in the Tang period, a version of the whole was accomplished. The enterprise had the warmest encouragement from the Court, and one of the Tang empresses early in the eighth century, not only sent to Khotan to procure a complete copy of the Sanskrit S&#363;tra,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></A></p>  
<p>but also wrote a preface for the Chinese version when it came out.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_254"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> It may have been that, in view of the close proximity once more of Christianity, Buddhism felt the need of advancing supernatural claims.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The Avata&#7747;saka S&#363;tra is full of the supernatural. In the days of S&#8217;akyamuni's life, immediately after he had, under the Bo-tree, attained to Enlightenment, he had (so it was said) remained in a trance of awe and wonder for the space of two weeks. It was now alleged that during that time he had in spirit ascended to the highest heaven, where, in a kind of Transfiguration, he had conversed with the two great Bodhisattvas&#8212;Manju&#347;ri and Samantabhadra&#8212;in the very presence of the Supreme and Everlasting Buddha Vairoc&#8217;ana.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> The doctrines thus delivered had been of a very deep and mysterious character, too deep for the ordinary mind of men to comprehend. S&#8217;akyamuni had therefore laid them aside for a while, and had not reverted to them again until towards the close of his ministry, when the disciples were sufficiently advanced to receive them.</p>  
<p>We have thus, as it were, three different Buddhist</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Trinities&#8212;the Trinity of the Hoss&#333;, namely, Roshana, Maitreya, and Manju&#347;ri; that of the Kegon, Vairoc&#8217;ana, Samantabhadra (<i>Fugen</i>), and Manju&#347;ri; that of the Pure Land, Amit&#257;bha, Kwannon, and Seishi&#8212;all claiming to come from the beginnings of the Mah&#257;y&#257;na, all supposed to have appeared simultaneously in China, just at the time when Christian missions first made their way to that empire, and all three brought over to Japan during the early years of the Nara period. At bottom the three sets meant pretty much the same thing, and the ethics of Buddhism were much the same whoever preached them; but the three represented sectarian differences, and there speedily appeared rivalries between jealous monks competing with one another for the favour of the court and nobility. This was one of the characteristics of the Nara age.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The student who has the time, inclination, and opportunity to prosecute further the study of this period, will find it full of very valuable historical material which throws a flood of light on the present life and thought of the Japanese people. Such a research lies far beyond the scope of the present work.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> We may, however, refer to one or two points of importance.</p>

<p>Amongst a number of sovereigns of no special importance K&#333;toku Tenn&#333; (645&#8211;654) is distinguished for the zeal with which he worked along the lines of political and civil reform laid down by Sh&#333;toku. The Taikwa reforms (so called from the <i>Nengo</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or year-period in which they were issued&#8212;an institution then first borrowed from China) brought the institutions of Japan very near to the Chinese models. The old offices of the <i>&#332;mi</i> and <i>&#332;muraji</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> were abolished, and three new officers, with Chinese titles, <i>Sadaijin</i>, <i>Udaijin</i>, <i>Naidaijin</i>, appointed to take their place. Exact reports were demanded from the governors of the provinces as to the conditions and needs of the people, a simple but (for the time) sufficient Court of Appeal was instituted, in the shape of a box placed at the palace gates to receive the complaints of the people, provincial boundaries were fixed, and the <i>Handen shuja-h&#333;</i> whilst providing that each peasant family should have a minimum allotment of rice land (two <i>tan</i> for a man, and a little more than one tan for a woman), also provided for the revenues of the State by taking one-twentieth of the produce for State purposes. Thus the State became the universal landlord, and the people paid a single tax inclusive of rent. The reforms were not carried out without opposition. Soga Ishikawamaro, who held the office of Udaijin, was falsely accused</p>

In estimating their value, it must be remembered that they are chronicles and not histories, and that, even so, the writers were obviously inspired with a desire to assert for Japan an antiquity, and consequently a dignity, equal to that claimed by the empire of the haughty Tangs. The lives of early sovereigns have therefore been in some cases extended beyond all bounds of probability, and</p>

<p>For the rest, the age was uncritical, superstitious, and therefore credulous. When the Kegon Scriptures were being expounded in the palace a pink cloud hovered over the building, which was taken to denote the presence of a celestial audience. A priest in the mountains of Tamba, who served a temple dedicated to Kwannon, was snowed up one winter's day, and, being cut off from access to the outer world for nearly a week, was in danger of starvation. As he prayed he heard a sound in the veranda, and, going out, found a joint of venison placed there. He ate it and lived, though by eating it he broke the laws of Buddhism. Some time after this, whilst cleaning his temple, he discovered the giver of the venison. From the thigh of the statue of Kwannon had been cut a piece of&#8212;wood, shall we call it? or flesh?&#8212;the exact size of the venison that had been placed on the veranda.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The deity himself, at the cost of a painful self-sacrifice, had saved the life of his worshipper.</p>  
<p>Wonder was in the air, and therefore when the Goddess of Is&eacute; proclaimed her identity with Amit&#257;bha, or Vairoc&#8217;ana, it was believed; and when the strange tales of the "Kojiki" came out, they also were accepted in faith. It is easy to sneer at the ages of credulity; it would be wiser, perhaps, to look back at the strange stories current in Europe during the same period, which our forefathers</p>

<p>believed with simple credulity. People who live in glass houses cannot afford to throw stones. At the same time no one could possibly hold up the Buddhism of the Nara age as a model for any one's admiration or imitation.</p>

<p>In the year 614 A.D. a boy was born in China. By what precise name his parents first knew him I do not know. Judging from the analogy of other men similarly situated, he had many names at different periods of his life. The name by which he was last known was Zend&#333; (<A NAME="img_20801"></A>

For the inland states on the Western frontiers were already looking to China for aid against the terror of the Arab, shortly to be kindled to victory by the enthusiasm of the new faith inspired by Mahomet, and only a few years were destined to elapse before Persia, at war with Constantinople, and overrun by the Arabs, should come to China in the vain hopes of an alliance against the new foe.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> To give another note of time, Sh&#333;toku Taishi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the greatest of Japan's early statesmen, and as</p>

<p>great in the religious world as he was in the political, was already busy with his celebrated reforms. The Constitution of the 17 Articles had already been in force some ten years when Zend&#333; was born; the ruler of Japan had already given offence to the vainglorious Sovereign of the Sui by the letter in which the "Eastern Emperor" sent his greeting, as an equal in rank, to his brother the "Emperor of the West," and Korea, which had already done so much for Japan in the way of religious and civilizing influences, was giving Japanese statesmen a good deal of political anxiety.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>In matters of religion, Confucianists and Taoists were apparently going on much as usual; but the Buddhist world, distracted partly by the immense volume and bulk of its own religious books, and partly by the multiplicity of the new ideas which the growing commercial activity of the people was importing from foreign countries, was in a state of apparently fermenting chaos.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Bodhidharma's attempts at reform (A.D. 520)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> were already a century old, and his way had already lost some of its prestige: new sects,</p>

<p><i>e.g.</i> the Sanron, J&#333;jitsu, and Tendai, were already in process of formation, if not actually formed, and Hiouen Thsang had already (A.D. 611) entered the order of monks,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and was now preparing for the celebrated journey to India for the purpose of studying at first hand the doctrines of his faith.</p>  
<p>Some reform was certainly needed. In the year 618, the Duke of Tang deposed his master, and took his seat on the Imperial throne as Kaotsu, the Founder of the Tang dynasty. One of the most striking incidents of his reign was the presentation of a petition to the throne against Buddhism. It was presented by leading men among the <i>literati</i> and Confucianists, and was strongly worded.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Kaotsu accepted the petition and acted upon it. He ordered a general dissolution and suppression of Buddhist monasteries, and sent 100,000 monks and nuns back into lay life. It was probably a necessary measure. The monks were very numerous and very powerful, and they claimed exemption from State control. Abuses of many kinds are apt to spring up in institutions the members of which claim not to be placed on the same footing with ordinary citizens.</p>  
<p>Zend&#333; entered the Buddhist order at a very early age. I cannot find whether it was before or after the suppression of the monasteries by Kaotsu; but it was most probably before that event, and his teacher was a certain Sh&#333;sh&#333; (<A NAME="img_21100"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21100.jpg">) of Misshu (<A NAME="img_21101"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21101.jpg">), a prominent person in the then newly-formed Sanron sect. This sect, which is also called the <i>Ichi-dai-ky&#333;shu</i>, or "Sect of the Teachings of Buddha's whole life," made it a feature of its teachings that it professed to accept every one of the many thousand volumes of the Mah&#257;y&#257;na Canon as of equal authority, without assigning to any single one a pre-eminent place among its compeers. It aimed at the most complete and glorious comprehensiveness</p>

<p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="green">p. 212</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (a comprehensiveness, which, I fear, can only be attained by the sacrifice of the critical faculty). Zend&#333;'s Buddhist biographer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> adds that he also studied the Vinaya discipline (a fact which may be taken as showing traces of a somewhat practical turn of mind), and notices further that, during these student days, he was continually restless, that he sighed for greater definiteness, and expressed a longing for that simpler doctrine of Salvation by Faith in Amida, which has always had its exponents in China as well as in Japan.</p>  
<p>At last, weary of the confusion, he went into the library, prayed for guidance, closed his eyes, and put out his hand for the book which was to simplify his Creed. The same story is told of others in Chinese Buddhism: in Zend&#333;'s case, his hand fell upon the volume of the Kwangy&#333; (the Amitayurdhy&#257;ni S&#363;tra),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> which relates how S&#8217;akyamuni comforted Queen Vaidehi in her distress</p>

<p>by reminding her of the mercies of Amit&#257;bha, "who is ever near thee." Zend&#333; read and received comfort; but he could not understand all he read, and where he was there was none to explain it.</p>  
<p>But he heard that, south of the Yangtze, at Rozan (<A NAME="img_21300"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21300.jpg">) there were traditions and books which might explain what he wanted. It was here that Eon (<A NAME="img_21301"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21301.jpg">), who died A.D. 416, had worked for thirty years, and had founded, in connection with a body of friends known as the "eighteen sages of Rozan," a guild known as the White Lotus Society, which was the first association of Buddhist monks and laymen for the joint adoration of Amida Butsu. Zend&#333; learned all that he could at Rozan, and then recommenced his travels, consulting as many religious teachers as he found likely to be able to give him helpful advice and counsel. What he learned from these teachers induced him to adopt a rule of life, known as <i>han shu sammai</i> (<A NAME="img_21302"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21302.jpg">), which reads almost like the stern rule of some Christian ascetic, still more so, perhaps, of that of some Manich&aelig;an fanatic. <i>Mi tsune ni butsu wo raishi, kuchi tsune ni butsu wo tonae, kokoro tsune ni butsu wo omou</i>. "His body ceaselessly engaged in the worship of Buddha, his mouth ceaselessly engaged in the recital of Buddha's praises, his heart ceaselessly meditating Buddha." With this in mind he retired to the Temple of Goshinji (<A NAME="img_21303"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21303.jpg">) in Shunnan, where, amidst beautiful mountain scenery, and in the solitude of retirement, he "beat out his music." It is quite evident that this retirement, which lasted for some years, was of great value in the formation of his religious ideas. The name of the temple signifies, not inaptly, the "Temple for the Instruction of Truth." He remained here until his 29th year, returning to Singanfu in the year A.D. 643.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="green">p. 214</font></A></p>  
<p>His stay, however, was for a short time only. Ever since his first conversion to Amidaism in the library, he had evidently been searching for any traces he could find of Amida followers in China. He had been to Rozan to examine Eon's literary remains and to get into touch with the White Lotus Society. We may presume that the Goshinji to which he retired was a place at which he would find persons in sympathy with his religious sentiments. Now he heard that D&#333;shaku (<A NAME="img_21400"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21400.jpg">), the monk who is reckoned as Zend&#333;'s predecessor in the list of Shinshu patriarchs, was teaching in the district of Shiny&#333; (<A NAME="img_21401"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21401.jpg">, Chinyang in Kiangsi), and he set off at once to visit the aged man.</p>  
<p>D&#333;shaku, who is reckoned by the J&#333;do Buddhist as the fourth patriarch of the Amida Doctrines, and therefore as Zend&#333;'s immediate predecessor, was born in Heish&#363; (<A NAME="img_21402"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21402.jpg">) in the year A.D. 553, and died in 636. He had experienced the persecution which the Buddhists had undergone during the reign of Wu-ti of the Chow (<A NAME="img_21403"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21403.jpg">) Dynasty,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and he was one of the few brave ones who remained faithful in spite of the violence of the storm. His predecessor, the third patriarch, Donran,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> had taught with considerable</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="green">p. 215</font></A></p>  
<p>effect in the district in which D&#333;shaka was born, and though he had been dead twenty years when D&#333;shaku came into the world, his influence was still felt in the neighbourhood. It was kneeling before the stone pillar erected to Donran's memory that D&#333;shaku made his vow to propagate the Doctrine of Salvation by Faith in Amida. D&#333;shaku was forty-eight years of age when he thus enrolled himself as a posthumous pupil of Donran's; but he is said to have developed the doctrine beyond what Donran had done. Donran had been drawn by the hope of eternal life, and it was this hope, set before him by the Indian monk Bodhiruci, that had made him burn his Taoist books of magic and set himself to the study of Amidaism. In D&#333;shaku's hands the Amida doctrine had developed in the direction of personality. He taught (if we may believe his latest biographer, Mr. Tada)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that Amida must be considered to be a personal Being and not a mere abstract ideal, and the book which he placed in Zend&#333;'s hands was the Larger Sukh&#257;vati Vy&#363;ha, the book which gives the account of Amida's life, of His Incarnation in the person of H&#333;z&#333; Biku, His labours undertaken for the Salvation of men, the successful accomplishment of His Great Vow, and His return to glory as King of His Western Paradise. This doctrine Zend&#333; accepted and preached. He may be said to have carried the doctrine a stage further. The followers of H&#333;nen Sh&#333;nin (otherwise known as Genk&#363;) form three communities: (i) the Shinshu, founded by Shinran, and (ii and iii) the two sub-sects of the older J&#333;do sect, the Chinsei-ha and the Seizan-ha.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The Chinsei-ha, agreeing in this respect with the Shinshu, differ from the Seizan-ha in the matter of reciting the Nembutsu. The latter community treat the Nembutsu as an act of adoration addressed to all the Buddhas; the Chinsei-ha and Shinshu treat it as addressed to Amida alone, as being the only Buddha, and the one to whom everything else is subordinate and subservient; and this practice, according to Murakami.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is due to the teachings of Zend&#333;. To Zend&#333;, therefore, the doctrine of faith became a doctrine involving a belief in a single Being, without beginning of days or end of life, unbounded</p>

<p>in every <A HREF="errata.htm#7">respect</A>, who, for man's salvation, had become a man, had accomplished a scheme of salvation, and had returned to his original glory.</p>  
<p>Zend&#333;'s biographers relate how, when the patriarch was on the way to visit D&#333;shaku, his road lay through forests and mountains, so rough and impassable that, at last, worn out with fatigue, he had to lie down to rest in a cave. He was fainting with hunger and weariness, and it was two days before he could raise himself. Then it seemed to him that a voice sounded in his ears: "Pull yourself together, and struggle on: your difficulties will disappear." We may perhaps inquire what these difficulties were and how they disappeared.</p>  
<p>D&#333;shaku is said to have died in the year A.D. 637. The date cannot be implicitly trusted, for it is also said that Zend&#333; was twenty-nine years old when he visited D&#333;shaku and accepted Amidaism, an impossible age, if Zend&#333; was born in A.D. 614. The explanation probably will be found in another statement to the effect that D&#333;shaku died five years after the visit of Zend&#333;. That would make Zend&#333; twenty-three years old when he visited D&#333;shaku, and we may easily believe that the conversion to Amidaism, as he came to learn it, may have been a slow process, not fully accomplished for several years. But, whichever way we look at it, the conversion of Zend&#333; to the full faith in Amida must have taken place about the year A.D. 636 (if anything a little later than that year), and in, or near, the capital city of Singanfu. From that date, and in that city, he began his preaching activity.</p>  
<p>China under the Tang dynasty had many dealings with Central Asia. The ruling family, as dukes of the dependent principality of Tang, had been much mixed up with Tartar and Turkish tribes, and it was apparently by their help that the family had been seated on the throne of China. From the moment, therefore, that the Dynasty was established, the new Empire became the cynosure of Central Asian eyes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> A Persian mission was sent by Chosroes II. praying for an alliance, and in 621 the first Zoroastrian temple was erected in Singanfu. The leader of this mission seems to have been a Magian of the name of Holu ("le fils du feu," as P. Gaubil calls him), who was very active in stirring up China against the Mahometans. Of Manich&aelig;ans in China proper there seems to be no mention for many years to come,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> but in 636,</p>

<p><a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 217</font></A></p>  
<p>almost synchronizing with the commencement of Zend&#333;'s preaching activity, arrived the Nestorian mission under Olopen, which has left behind it an enduring memorial in stone. Is it possible that the "difficulties" with which Zend&#333; was troubled, when he lay wearied in the cave on his way to D&#333;shaku, were difficulties connected with the relations between the Buddhist Faith and the Faith which the Nestorians preached?</p>  
<p>We can trace the development of Zend&#333;'s thought. Confused by the multiplexity of the popular Buddhism of his day, he turns to the scripture in which S&#8217;akyamuni is represented as comforting</p>  
<p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Vaidehi with the proximity and tender watchfulness of Amida. Then he goes south of Rozan, to the remnants of Eon and his White Lotus Guild, after which, in the solitude of the Goshinji Temple, he works out his problem. In the meantime he hears of Christianity (by no means an impossibility if we remember the story of the introduction of silkworms into Europe a century before). What is he to do or say? He goes to D&#333;shaku to resolve his doubts, and D&#333;shaku tells him of "Eternal Life," and gives him the Sukh&#257;vati Vyuha, which tells of Amida as a Person who came down upon Earth, who opened the door of salvation, and has gone to the place He has prepared for us.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></A></p>  
<p>After 636, then, we find, in Singanfu, two men preaching almost similar doctrines, the one preaching them in connection with Christ, the other in connection with Amida. It is further said of Zend&#333;'s activity that he was constantly helped by a mysterious priest who came to visit him every evening and helped him with his commentaries (see Tada, "Shoshingek&#333;wa," p. 359). This mysterious collaborator may have been a Christian, and if so, the strange coincidences, the almost Pauline echoes, which are constantly to be found in Zend&#333;'s writings, would be amply accounted for. Nor is the supposition a baseless one; for we have one clear instance of such collaboration between a Buddhist and Nestorian about a century later, when the Nestorian priest King Tsing (or Adam, as he is called on the Singanfu monument) collaborated with the Indian monk Prajna in the translation of a book on the Six Cardinal Virtues (<i>Shat Par&#257;mit&#257; Sutra</i>).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The original was not in Sanskrit, but in the Hu (<A NAME="img_21900"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21900.jpg">), <i>i.e.</i> the Persian, or, more probably, the Uigur language. At any rate, not much came of this attempted collaboration, which probably caused much jealousy and opposition. It was after a while forbidden by the Emperor Taitsung, who, in a published decree, ordered the Nestorian King Tsing to confine himself to the teachings of <i>Mishiho</i>, and to leave the followers of S&#8217;akyamuni to propagate the teachings of their master.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The suggestion of opposition raised against such collaboration, on the part of friendly disposed believers of the two religions, by more strait-laced partisans, brings me to another point of contact between Zend&#333; and the Nestorians. It is said (my authority again is Mr. Tada) that great opposition was made against Zend&#333; for his preaching. A butcher, whose customers had left him to turn</p>

And not only did persons of low degree set themselves against them. The <i>literati</i> persecuted him and his followers, as did also the priests of the other Buddhist sects. When the Emperor Kaotsung died in 684, the reins of the Government fell into the hands of the Empress-Dowager Wu-hu, who was under the influence of a Buddhist monk named Hwai-yi, a monk of one of the sects opposed to Zend&#333;'s teaching, and Hwai-yi in 694 caused much popular discontent among the lower classes by burning a favourite temple, which may have been Zend&#333;'s. For the common people heard Zend&#333; gladly, and it was his preaching of a Gospel to the poor and outcast that annoyed the literati and the "Salvation-by-knowledge" Schools of Buddhists.</p>  
<p>Strange to say, the Nestorians, well received and honourably treated by Taitsung and Kaotsung, fall into disgrace, and are persecuted, as soon as Kaotsung's death leaves the supreme power in the hands of the Empress-Dowager Wu-hu, and her adviser Hwai-yi. The persecution of the Nestorians is instigated by the same people as that against the followers of Zend&#333;, and much the same pretexts are alleged. Moreover, the persecution of the two bodies goes on for the same time, and relief comes to them simultaneously. Of the Nestorians we read that Huantsung (723&#8211;756), succeeding Wu-hu, rebuilds the "Temple of Felicity," as the Nestorian Church is called, that Huantsung's successor, Sutsung (756&#8211;763), coming into a disordered inheritance recovers Singanfu which was in the hands of rebels, and erects "luminous" temples in various parts of his Empire, and finally that the Emperor Taitsung (763&#8211;780), the same who discouraged the</p>

<p>collaboration of King Tsing and Prajn&#257;, not only celebrated the Bon Festival with the Buddhists in the seventh month, but kept Christmas in the twelfth with the Nestorians, "burning incense" in a "luminous temple" with the "luminous multitude." As to Zend&#333;'s followers, we find them gathering round a teacher named Ekan, not very long after the master's death. Ninety years after that event, a monk named Hoss&#333; is mentioned as acquiring great fame, and in 793 Sh&#333;k&#333; makes Ury&#363;san (<A NAME="img_22100"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/22100.jpg">) the headquarters of the teachings promulgated by Zend&#333;. But by that time the Emperor Taitsung was already dead (ob. 780), and the collaboration between Amidaist and Christian had already been prohibited.</p>  
<p>When the Nestorian mission first arrived in China in A.D. 636, they procured from the Emperor Teitsung a decree authorizing the erection of a <i>Tatsin</i> (<i>i.e.</i> a Syrian) temple. This name, however, may have led to confusion, for both Zoroastrians and Manich&aelig;ans might conceivably have claimed the title (loosely construed), and in fact did so. When Huantsung, soon after 713, rebuilds the Nestorian Church, it is called a "Temple of Felicity." When Sutsung, in 756, recovers Singanfu, the Nestorian Churches are "luminous (<A NAME="img_22101"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/22101.jpg">) temples," and this name has come to be identified with Nestorianism ever since, both in China and Japan.</p>  
<p>When Zend&#333; died, the Emperor Kaotsung (650&#8211;683) granted to the temple in which he resided the honorific title of K&#333;my&#333;ji (<A NAME="img_22102"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/22102.jpg">), which is only another form of "luminous temple." The popular explanation of this name is obviously a fanciful one. Bright rays of light do not come out of the mouths of even the most eloquent preachers of any faith, nor do books, however holy and mouldy, glow with a phosphorescent light. Yet that was what Sh&#333;k&#333; is said to have seen issuing from the works of Zend&#333; preserved in the library at the White Horse Monastery.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_290"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Kaotsung was an enlightened monarch, and if he gave the title of K&#333;my&#333;ji, it must have been for the quality of the doctrine and not by reason of any doubtful miracle. But it is quite probable that "luminous temple" and <i>K&#333;my&#333;ji</i> may have been used as alternative titles to describe the Faith in One Saviour as taught, both by the Nestorians and the children of Zend&#333;, during the period of collaboration, and that later, when Taitsung ordered the two to keep apart, the name of K&#333;my&#333;ji was taken by the Buddhist section</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></A></p>  
<p>of the "movement" as their own specific designation, the Manich&aelig;ans distinguishing their temple by the title <i>Dai-un-k&#333;my&#333;ji</i>.</p>  
<p>This view receives considerable support from Japanese history. Sh&#333;toku Taishi, whom the Shinshu honour as the first of their <i>Zenchishiki</i> or Saints, died in 621, shortly after the commencement of the Tang Dynasty. Buddhism was, therefore, in full swing in Japan when, in 636, the Nestorian Mission arrived at Singanfu, and Zend&#333; began his preaching, and there were many Japanese students being sent yearly to China for purposes of study.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Not only so, but there were many Chinese families residing in Japan and naturalized there (<i>ayabito</i>), and it has been noticed that most of K&#333;toku Tenn&#333;'s Taikwa Reforms (A.D. 645&#8211;654) were worked out for him by these <i>ayabito</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The whole of the Nara period was an age in which Japan was peculiarly sensitive to Chinese influences, and especially to the influences of Chinese Buddhism.</p>  
<p>This influence seems to have reached its maximum during the reign of Sh&#333;mu Tenn&#333; (724&#8211;748) and his Consort K&#333;my&#333; K&#333;g&#333; (the very name, a posthumous one, is in itself significant). Sh&#333;mu Tenn&#333; was a very zealous Buddhist. He founded hospitals and charitable institutions, and his Empress distinguished herself by personally undertaking the nursing of lepers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>&#8212;a truly Christian work. Japan was in no position at the time to undertake hospital work unaided. Foreign doctors had to be employed, and the industry of Japanese students has recently shown us the presence in Japan, at the Court, of a Nestorian Christian (the Nestorian Christians were famous all</p>

<p>over the East for their skill in medicine).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Here, therefore, we have possibly two instances of simultaneous collaboration, Buddhist and Christian uniting in the production of books in China, and in works of charity in Japan.</p>  
<p>In 781, the Singanfu monument is erected, and shortly before, or afterwards, the Chinese Emperor finds reason for prohibiting the collaboration. In 782 the Emperor Kwammu comes to the throne of Japan. The Buddhists have been giving themselves airs for some time, and the ambitious priest D&#333;ky&#333;, intriguing with the Empress Sh&#333;toku (765&#8211;769), has assumed the title of H&#333; &#332;, or "religious emperor," a kind of pope! Kwammu determines to put an end to the political intrigues of the Nara clergy, removes his capital to Kyoto, and sends K&#333;b&#333; and Dengyo to China to investigate religion. They come back, the one with the Shingon, the</p>

<p>other with the Tendai. Again it is significant that these sects, and especially the Tendai, which became practically the State religion of Japan for many centuries, were the very sects which had organized the persecution against Zend&#333;, when he first began to preach his doctrine of Salvation by Faith in Amida.</p>  
<p>But the light still shone, in spite of the opposition of the Tendai. Zend&#333;'s books came over to Japan, Mr. Tada tells us, at different times between 796 and 858, and several monks, such as K&#363;ya and Eikwan, kept alive the faith in Amida, invoking His Name on Hieizan, or wandering, disguised as travelling priests or horsedealers (<i>umakata</i>), from province to province, preaching a simple faith to country peasants.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And finally, the great H&#333;nen (Genial), breaking with the Tendai, as so many others had done, in order to return to the teaching of Zend&#333;, founds at Kurodani a temple, still known as <i>Konkai K&#333;my&#333;ji</i>, "the Illustrious Temple of the Golden Precept," which is to this day one of the chief seats of the Chinsei sub-division of the J&#333;do sect. And it is this Chinsei-ha which preserves Zend&#333;'s rule of making the Nembutsu an invocation of the Great Amida alone, to the exclusion of all the rest.</p>

<p>That the Nestorian mission was as much political as religious may e seen in the fact that an <i>Olopen</i> (was it a name or a title?) visited the court of the great Indian ruler Siladitya Harsha in 636. It is clear that the Nestorians, making common cause with their Persian protectors and friends, were actively engaged in trying to procure allies for them in their warfare against the Arabian invaders. Many Nestorian dioceses were destroyed when the Arabs annexed Merv, Balkh, Herat, etc., in A.D. 644. Hiouen Thsang, the Chinese traveller, was also in India at the time, returning to China in A.D. 645. It is also noteworthy that from this date both Siladitya Harsha and Taitsung now become more favourable to Buddhism. Neumann ("Asiatische Studien," i. 166) quotes, out of a Chinese work published about A.D. 502, a description of Persia, in which it is stated that there were many Buddhist temples in the Persian capital. Buddhist survivals are still to be traced in the doctrines of the Shiite, and still more so in those of the Sufite, sect of Mahometanism. It is quite probable that both Zoroastrianism and Manich&aelig;ism were looked upon as legitimate variants of Buddhism. There were Nestorians in China before Olopen&#8212;some are mentioned as early as A.D. 508.</P>

<p>One of the natural consequences of the adoption of the system known as <i>Ry&#333;bu</i> ("two parts") was that, by treating the native gods of Japan as merely incarnations of one or other of the Buddhas, and as therefore entitled to the worship of the Buddhists, the Japanese were enabled to introduce into their Buddhism many non-Buddhist elements. Thus Amida and. Vairoc&#8217;ana, both of them symbolized by the Sun, came to be identified with <i>Tensh&#333;k&#333;daijin</i>, the "Heaven-shining-mighty goddess," from whom the Imperial house claims descent. (The change of sex is unimportant, for many of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, <i>e.g.</i> Kwannon, are bisexual.) Thus, too, Buddhism, which absolutely forbids the taking of life, gained a Buddhified god of war in Hachiman, and Buddhist monks, who worshipped the god of war, could with quiet consciences take to fighting. Nichiren ("Seigoroku," p. 132) speaks of Tensh&#333;daijin and Hachiman as the true lords of Japan, revealed in later times as Buddhas, and Hideyoshi, who openly avowed his desire for deification, built for himself a temple in which he intended to be worshipped after his death as Shin Hachiman, the new god of war.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_253"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_255">202:2</A> The list of Avatamsaka S&#363;tras given by Nanjo gives us some data for fixing the age of N&#257;g&#257;rjuna. One of the chapters was translated by Lokaraksha of the Han Dynasty who reached Loyang in A.D. 147. It would follow that N&#257;g&#257;rjuna must have lived before that date. Again, all Buddhist authorities in Japan place him 600 years after the Parinirvana. If we fix that at about 500 B.C. we get N&#257;g&#257;rjuna's date about 100 A.D., which agrees very well both with the translation of the chapter by Lokaraksha and with the year assigned by Eusebius and other writers for the <i>terminus a quo</i> of Gnosticism.</P>

Between them they made a translation of the "Shatpar&#257;mit&#257; S&#363;tra," which they offered to the Emperor Tetsung. The Emperor, however, refused to receive it, saying that King Ching should devote himself to preaching the doctrines of <i>Meshiho</i> (Messiah), leaving the Buddhists to propagate the teachings of S&#8217;akyamuni. The book therefore appears in Prajn&atilde;'s name only.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_256"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_258">203:3</A> Vairoc&#8217;ana is said to be distinct from the Roshana of the Hoss&#333;, though in practice he is almost always identified with him.

<P><A NAME="fn_257"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_259">204:1</A> It is very interesting to trace chronologically the workings of the different Buddhist sects in the early years of Japanese Buddhism. Of the rival Trinities, the first to reach Japan is undoubtedly that which has Amit&#257;bha as its central figure. A century later comes the Trinity of Roshana, and still later again that of Vairoc&#8217;ana. For a while syncretism prevails, and an attempt is made to treat the three as identical. Geshin is the first to see that this syncretism is impossible. Finally, H&#333;nen and Shinran, in the twelfth century, get the courage of their convictions, and proclaim Amida as the True and only Refuge of the Buddhist believer.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_258"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_260">204:2</A> I would call the attention of the European reader to the very suggestive work "Le Japon," by M. de la Mazeli&egrave;re, of which, I believe, three volumes have appeared. The author brings out very clearly the <a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="green">p. 205</font></A> points of Japan's indebtedness to China and India for the materials of much of her religious thought.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_259"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_261">205:1</A> The practice of reckoning time by certain periods of years arbitrarily fixed from time to time, for the purpose of worrying the historian, had been long in vogue in China. K&#333;toku introduced it in Japan, and there have been over 240 such periods since that time.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_260"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_262">205:2</A> The &#332;mi and &#332;muraji were in ancient times the ministers of the Emperor. The offices were hereditary. The new offices were not so in intention, but the Japanese is an oligarch by constitution, and the new offices gradually came to be monopolized by certain families.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_267"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_269">208:1</A> The Sui dynasty ruled in China from 589&#8211;619 A.D. They came to power at the close of a long period of division, the Empire having been previously divided into many small kingdoms, with Chinese rulers south of the Yangtse, and Tartar or Turkish chieftains in the northern districts. Such were the Wei (Tartars), the Hsia (Hun), the Northern Yen (Tartar), the Western Liang (Turkish), and the Western Tsin&nbsp; (Thibetan). These smaller kingdoms are of great importance in the History of Buddhism, for it was in them rather than in China proper that Buddhism flourished before the Tang period. The Sui family had but two Sovereigns&#8212;Wenti (589&#8211;606), who united China and carried the Chinese name far among the Turks in the North and East; and Yangti (605&#8211;617), a man of violent temper, prone to debauchery and extravagance, who brought the Empire to the verge of ruin. He was overthrown by Li-y&uuml;an of the Tang family, who ascended the throne in A.D. 618, as Kaotsu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_268"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_270">209:1</A> It will be well to remember that under the earlier Tang Emperors, Chinese Viceroyalties extended as far as the frontiers of the Persian Empire, and that even monarchs like Siladitya Harsha of Kanauj acknowledged Chinese influence. It must also be remembered that Kaotsu suppressed Buddhist monasteries, sending 100,000 bonzes and nuns about their business, being stimulated thereto by petitions from Chinese literati. Buddhism had many enemies: <i>e.g.</i> in India, where Harsha's predecessor had likewise (in 601) dissolved the Buddhist monasteries, and even uprooted the famous Bodhi-tree. V. A. Smith, "Early History of India."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_269"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_271">209:2</A> It will be well to keep a few dates in mind. The first Persian Temple (whether Zoroastrian or Manich&aelig;an is not quite clear) was erected at Singanfu, in 621, three years after Kaotsu's accession. The Persian Empire, under Chosroes II., was at the time at war with Rome (or rather Constantinople), a Persian army was on the Bosphorus. This war was a great strain on the Persian dominions, and there were other causes for anxiety. Mahomet, born 570, had announced himself as a prophet in 610, and the Hejira, from which all Mahometans date their years, took place in 622. Siladitya Harsha, whose Indian Empire extended over the whole basin of the Ganges, and who began as a warlike monarch, came to the throne A.D. 606. He, too, received an Embassy from the Persians, which he housed in a monastery near Multan, and massacred after entertaining them liberally. This must have been before his conversion to Buddhism, which seems to have been about 645 (V. A. Smith," Early History of India"). The Persians were evidently looking everywhere for helpful allies.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_270"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_272">209:3</A> Sh&#333;toku Taishi's political activity may be said to have begun with <a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></A> the battle of Shikisen in 587, when the Shinto supporters were crushed. He became Crown Prince in 593, proclaimed Buddhism in 595, promulgated his Constitution of 17 Articles in 604, sent his celebrated letter to the "Emperor of the West" (Yangti of Sui) in 609, and died in 621. With him may be said to end the Korean period of Japanese Buddhism.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_271"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_273">210:1</A> Korea, divided into several small states, was fluctuating in allegiance between China and Japan. Yangti of Sui sent an expedition to Korea (A.D. 615), and Sh&#333;toku was much concerned to preserve Japanese influence in the peninsula.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_272"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_274">210:2</A> With a few exceptions, the early books translated by the Buddhist missionaries of the Han period (ended A.D. 220) and of the era of confusion which followed, were so badly done as to be practically unintelligible. Kumaraj&#299;va, a native of Karachar, with apparently both Chinese and Indian blood in his veins, arrived at Changan in A.D. 406, and inaugurated a new era of translation. Amongst the books of which he provided fresh translations were the Sukh&#257;vati Vy&#363;has and the Hokeky&#333;. Kum, therefore marks a new period in the history of the Chinese Buddhism.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_273"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_275">210:3</A> Not even with Kumaraj&#299;va's efforts could Buddhism in China be brought into a satisfactory condition. Bodhidharma's efforts were devoted to introducing a form of Buddhism which should not depend upon books, but teach men by contemplation to get straight to the Heart of Buddha.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_274"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_276">211:1</A> Hiouen Thsang, born A.D. 602, enters the Order 622, about the time of Kaotsu's edict against the monasteries; unable to satisfy his mind, starts for India, 629, meets Silabhadra in India and enters the Nalanda monastery in 638, returns to China 645. The Emperor Teitsung writes a preface for his translation in 648. Hiouen Thsang is regarded as the founder of the Hosso sect, and it shows how close was the connection between Japan and China that the same sect appears in Japan 653, having been brought over by D&#333;sh&#333;, a student under Hiouen Thsang. It is noteworthy that H. T. did not bring Amidaism of the Zend&#333; type back from India. Perhaps he did not find it there.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_277"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_279">212:2</A> The Kwangy&#333;, which is the second longest of the three J&#333;do books, was not translated into Chinese until A.D. 424, its translator being Kalayasas, a contemporary of Kum&#257;rajiva. The Larger Sukh&#257;vati Vy&#363;ha was translated as early as A.D. 147, by Anshikao and also by one of his companions, there being two later translations, one in 252 by Sanghavarman, and one of the Smaller Sukh. Vy. by Kum&#257;rajiva about 420. This would seem to point to the fact that Eon's teaching must have been based entirely on the earlier translations of the Larger Sukh&#257;vati Vy&#363;ha, if, indeed, it was based on the present Amida books at all. Eon's spiritual father was D&#333;an (d. 390), a native of Ch&#8217;angshan in Chekiang, who moved to J&#333;y&#333; (<A NAME="img_21200"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21200.jpg">), where he was besieged and taken prisoner by a king named Fu Ken (<A NAME="img_21201"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21201.jpg">), who ruled over one of the Central Asian principalities. During D&#333;an's lifetime, the Tsin Emperor Hiao-wu-ti was converted to Buddhism, chiefly owing <A HREF="errata.htm#5">to</A> Tangut influences. D&#333;an professed to have the aid of Pindola (Jap. Bindzuru), and was devoted to all the Buddhas, though perhaps especially to Amida, as may be inferred from his nickname <i>Miten no D&#333;an</i>, "Doan of Mida's Heaven." Eon, who followed him, seems to have been entirely devoted to Amida, as was also the Society which ho founded, and which, there is some reason to suppose, was Manich&aelig;an. In the lifetime of Eon and Man began the streams of Chinese pilgrims to India, Fahian being the first. It is noteworthy that none of these pilgrims seem to have brought back anything definite about Amida from India. This is especially noticeable in the case of Hiouen Thsang, and it seems to point to the Central Asian origin of the Amida cult.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_278"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_280">213:1</A> It is said of Eon that he was so strict in his observance of <A HREF="errata.htm#6">Buddhist</A> discipline that when, on his deathbed, he was ordered to take honey, he first set his pupils to find out whether the Buddhist rule permitted it. While they were still examining, he died. Once he broke his rule of retirement by mistake, being so engrossed in conversation that he inadvertently went outside the bounds of his hermitage. This is a favourite theme for artists. We may here mention another theme, frequently found in Buddhist pictures, which may be called the "Narrow Way." A pilgrim, pursued by wild beasts, demons, and evil spirits, arrives at the edge of a precipice. In front of him are two lakes, the one of water, filled with sharks and other monsters of the deep, the other of fire and peopled with devils. Between the two is <a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="green">p. 214</font></A> a very narrow strip of precipitous rock, necessitating the wariest of walking, the first false step meaning instant destruction on the one side or the other. It is dark; but on the other side of the narrow pathway stands Amida, who has accomplished salvation. A ray of light issues from him, and the legend above him is <i>Namu Amide Butsu</i>, which Zend&#333; taught men to translate "Trust ME, for I will save you"&#8212;the meaning of the word <i>Jesus</i>, but not that of the Buddhist legend.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_280"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_282">214:2</A> <i>Donran</i> died in 533. Like all the Amidaists, he was not a pure Chinaman, but a subject of one of the small northern kingdoms. Wu-ti, of the Liang, <i>circ</i>. A.D. 528, was a great admirer of Donran's. It is interesting to note that shortly after Donran's death, within the lifetime both of D&#333;shaku and Zend&#333;, an attempt was made (the forerunner of the Ryobu Shinto in Japan) to amalgamate Buddhism with Taoism). I quote it to show that this was an age of syncretic aspirations, Donran may almost have been a contemporary of Vasubhandhu. Some trace of the tendency to make common cause with Taoism may be perhaps found in the syllable D&#333; (<A NAME="img_21404"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21404.jpg">) in the assumed names of <i>D&#333;an</i>, or <i>D&#333;shaku</i>. Donran was certainly a Taoist before becoming a Buddhist. The <i>D&#333;</i> in Zend&#333;'s name is slightly different (<A NAME="img_21405"></A>

<P><A NAME="fn_285"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_287">216:2</A> Acc. to the authors of <i>Mem. Conc. la Chine</i> (see xvi. 227, also <a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 217</font></A> Kaeuffer, ii. 663) the first mention of <i>Moni</i> or Manich&aelig;an monks among the Tartar tribes occurs in 786. I am indebted to my friend Mr. S. Tachibana for the following data concerning the Manich&aelig;ans, which somewhat modify these statements. In the fifth year of the J&#333;kwan (Chih Kwan) period of the Tang dynasty, <i>i.e.</i> A.D. 632, a Manich&aelig;an named Boku-go-ka-roku obtained from the Emperor Taitsung permission to erect a Tatsin Temple (Jap. <i>Taishinji</i>) at Singanfu. Tatsin was a generic name for Persia and Syria, and the name Taishinji was at first applied indifferently to all temples, Christian, Manich&aelig;an, or Zoroastrian, devoted to the propagation of faiths coming from those regions. In 734, the Emperor Hi&uuml;an Tsung ordered the destruction of all Manich&aelig;an Temples (probably of all Tatsin Temples), and forbade the promulgation of Manich&aelig;anism. In 746, the same emperor removed the prohibition and ordered that all temples belonging to religions of Persian nationality should be called Taishinji, whether in the two capitals or in the neighbouring country districts. In the third year of Daireki (Chin. Ta-lai), <i>i.e.</i> 768, Taitsung authorized Persian subjects to erect <i>Dai Un K&#333;my&#333;ji</i> (<A NAME="img_21700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21700.jpg">), evidently as something distinct from the <A HREF="errata.htm#8">Taishinji</A>, also as distinct from Buddhism. Again, in the third year of the Emperor Wutsung, A.D. 843, all Manich&aelig;an Temples were closed and many of their priests, nuns, and laity put to death or sent into exile. In the meantime the K&#333;my&#333; doctrine had reached Japan. It had been brought to China in the reign of the Empress <i>Wu</i>, in the first year of Yen Tsai, in 694 by a Persian of the name of <i>Pu-ta-tan</i> (<A NAME="img_21701"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21701.jpg">). The Empress Jito was then on the throne. She was a zealous Buddhist. In the year 692, she received from the Chinese Ambassador a statue of Amida, and copies of a S&#363;tra called <i>Son K&#333;my&#333; Ky&#333;</i>, which she caused to be preached throughout her empire. It is difficult not to connect this with the Faith that Zend&#333; had preached. (Mr. Tachibana quotes from <i>Bussot&#333;ki</i>, fasc. 39&#8211;42. See also Haas, "Annalen des Japanischen Buddhismus," p. 318, and D&eacute;v&eacute;ria, <i>Journal Asiatique</i>, ix.&#8211;x. p. 445).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_286"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_288">218:1</A> I would like to call attention to an excellent article entitled the "Mystery of Fulin," by Dr. Hirth, of Columbia, which has just appeared in vol. xxx., part 1, of the <i>Journal of the Am. Oriental Society</i>. Dr. Hirth has long maintained (and gives reasons for so doing) that this embassy came from the Patriarch of Antioch as head of the Nestorian Church. There is also a great deal of information in Mrs. Gordon's recent work on the Messiah, a book which, despite its superabundant mysticism, is full of valuable information and most suggestive in the many hints and indications it gives for further investigation and research. It is interesting to observe that Olopen and his missionaries emphasize the fact that they come, not from the King of Persia or any political power, but from the Patriarch of Antioch, a purely spiritual personage with no political influence at all. Perhaps they did this on purpose to avoid being mixed up with Manich&aelig;ans and Zoroastrians, who were more closely connected with the Persian State. Dr. Grierson, in his article on Bhakti-marga, in vol. ii. of Hasting's "Encyclopedia of Religions," shows us the same Olopen, three years later, in India, at the Court of Siladitya Harsha, whore he is well received. This will show us how Nestorianism was at work, quietly and unobtrusively, in India as in China. We know that there were Christians in China before Olopen, for the Emperor Justinian (527&#8211;565) received a present of silkworms brought to him by monks who had been living for some years either in Singanfu or in Nanking, These missionaries can scarcely have been Nestorians, seeing that Justinian had a great dislike to that body of Christians. On the Singanfu monument, erected 781, Olopen is described as Daitoku (<A NAME="img_21800"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/21800.jpg">). In the year 771, the Emperor Taitsung appointed ten Daitoku, men of recognized virtue and merit. The erectors of the monument would scarcely have ventured to give Olopen this title unless it had been (posthumously perhaps) conferred on him by the Emperor (see Murakami, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 804; and E. A. Parker, "Notes on the Nestorians," <i>J.R.A.S</i>, North China Branch, vol. xxiv. p. 297).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_287"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_289">219:1</A> It is to be found in the Buddhist Canon. See Nanjo's Catalogue, No. 1004.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_288"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_290">219:2</A> Prof. Takakusu called attention to Prajna in his Translation of I-Tsing's "Record of the Buddhist Religion," (Oxford, 1896). <i>Mishiho</i> is Messiah. Among the Jews in Kaifongfu, in Honan, are preserved portions of the prophets Zechariah and Malachi. A phrase which Zend&#333; uses more than once is <i>Fushi S&#333;g&#333;</i>, "the turning of the hearts of parents and children to one another," a phrase which at once suggests Malachi to the mind. Zend&#333;'s phrase was later made the title of the well-known Japanese J&#333;do book, the <i>Fushi S&#333;g&#333;</i>. I am much indebted to Dr. Haas, of Heidelberg, for calling my attention to this matter.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_289"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_291">220:1</A> Tada says that Zend&#333;'s preaching was so persuasive that many of his hearers committed suicide by burning themselves alive. Mr. Tada rightly feels called upon to apologize for this; but no student of the Hokeky&#333; will need to be reminded that to make a holocaust of oneself is set forth in the Hokeky&#333; as the highest form of grateful adoration. But the word "holocaust" is also a good Christian expression, spiritually interpreted, and I venture to suggest that the holocausts in Zend&#333;'s time may have been of this kind. I am encouraged to think this by the fact that in the short biography of Zend&#333; which appears in <i>Shinshu Seikun</i>, the word <i>ny&#363;j&#333;</i> (<A NAME="img_22000"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/22000.jpg">) is used to describe the occurrence. <i>Ny&#363;j&#333;</i> literally means "to enter into the state of determination," though Hepburn in his Dictionary, explains it as meaning voluntary suicide by fire.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_290"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_292">221:1</A> See Nanjo, "Short History of the Twelve Buddhist Sects," p. 107.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_291"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_293">222:1</A> See Haas, <i>op. cit.</i> I am much indebted to this work. I have already shown, in notes on Hiouen Thsang and the Manichees, how quickly Japan, at this particular period, was moved by any new religious movement in the capital of the Tangs.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_292"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_294">222:2</A> See "Melanges Japonais," vol. iii. p. 287.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_293"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_295">222:3</A> Murakami, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 145&#8211;6. A little point, worthy of remark, is the following. In 639, Olopen, having established his missionaries at Singanfu, goes on to India and visits the court of Siladitya Harsha, at Kanauj. Shortly after this, wo read of Harsha's zeal for works of charity, leper hospitals, etc., institutions which Buddhism had scarcely known since the days of As&#8217;oka, but which have constantly been a conspicuous element in all Christian work. In Japan, what I may call the <i>K&#333;my&#333;</i> doctrines find their way into the country under Jit&#333; and Mommu (637&#8211;697). Here also they are followed by a period of enthusiasm for works of charity which continues for a while, until the tares spring up and choke the good seed, and the Tendai, the ancient enemies of Zend&#333;, get the upper hand.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_294"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_296">223:1</A> The following are the data known about the Nestorian doctor Rimitsu. In the year A.D. 739 there arrived from China a ship-load of distinguished persons. (1) Kibi Mabi, who had been studying in China since 716, and who brought back with him the art of embroidery, the game of <i>go</i>, the <i>biwa</i>, and the Katakana alphabet. (2) D&#333;sen, the founder in Japan of the Kegon (or Avatamsaka) sect. (3) A Brahman priest, Bodhisena, from India. (4) A musician named Fat Triet (Buttetsu) from Cambodia; and (5) a Nestorian physician of Persian nationality named Rimitsu. The party were received on behalf of the Government by Gyogi, at Naniwa, and Gyogi was able to display his learning by conversing with the Indian Brahman in Sanskrit. A month later, a member of the Japanese Embassy in China returned to Japan with three Chinese and another Persian. The whole party were taken to court and the Emperor conferred official rank upon them, especial mention being made of Rit&#333;ho, a Chinaman, and Rimitsu. In 736 Sh&#333;mu was in the midst of his hospital schemes, and Rimitsu was evidently a distinguished physician. The Japanese must have been very different from what they are now if they neglected the opportunity of sucking his brains! Mr. Tachibana, who has furnished me with the materials for this note, bases his information on an article by Dr. Takakusu in "Shigakuzasshi," vol. iii. No. 7, and on Dr. Kume's "History of the Nara Epoch." That Rimitsu was a Christian was shown some time ago by Mr. Saeki. Ho could not have been a Manich&aelig;an, seeing that the Manich&aelig;ans discouraged doctors.</p>  
<p>Gyogi Bosatsu was the spiritual director of Sharma and his Empress K&#333;my&#333;. He was an advocate of K&#333;my&#333; doctrines, very practical, very charitable. He was a syncretist, and first originated the Ry&#333;bu doctrine in Japan, stimulated thereto by the example of the Buddhists and Taoists in China.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_295"></A><A HREF="chj21.htm#fr_297">224:1</A> It is said of Zend&#333; that he and his disciples were much given to itinerant preaching. So were the Nestorians. The Greek merchant Cosmas Indicopleustes, who was in India A.D. 535, mentions a Nestorian order of itinerant preachers named Periodeut&aelig;, or wanderers, who were busy in his days evangelizing in N. W. India. Olopen himself. may have been one; we find him in China and then in India. It is possible that K&#363;ya and Eikwan may have been itinerant preachers after this type, having learned the value of it from Zend&#333;. So also may have been the mysterious personage who, in 1095, appeared to Ryonin, the founder of the Y&#363;dz&#363;nembutsu, and told him of the "One man that stood for all men, and the one religious act that embraced all others." Ippen (1239&#8211;1239), the founder of the Ji Sect, wandered in his allegiance from the Tendai to the Seizanha of the J&#333;do, and finally founded a sect of his own. He was a great student of Zend&#333;, both as a teacher and as an artist, and his sect was intended to be a reproduction of Zend&#333;'s teachings. His nickname was Y&#363;gy&#333; Sh&#333;nin, "the itinerating preacher," and to this day, the head of the Ji sect is supposed to be always travelling about the country preaching.</P>
