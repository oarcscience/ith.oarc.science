<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">I can</span> only plead for my book that it is the work of a pioneer, and every pioneer knows that his labours must necessarily be crude and imperfect. I foresee all the strictures that criticism will pass upon my labours, and shall be more than content if what I have written stimulates others to further research.</p>  
<p>More should have been said about the lives and teachings of H&#333;nen, Shinran, and other leaders of the J&#333;do or Pure Land sects. The omission is due to the fact that I have already dealt with these thinkers in a monograph entitled "Shinran and His Work," which I published in Tokyo last year. Even with these omissions I fear this book will seem rather bulky.</p>  
<p>My best thanks are due to the Master of Peterhouse, who has put himself to much trouble on my behalf.</p>
