<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Buddhism of Kamakura</span></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kamakura</span> is connected with Yoritomo and the Regents of the H&#333;j&#333; family. Yoritomo, the first of the Minamoto Sh&#333;guns (1147&#8211;1199), was the son of that Yoshitomo who, after leaguing himself with the Taira against his own clan, and bearing arms against his own father, ended by breaking with the Taira for their want of gratitude, and perished miserably at the hands of one of his own retainers, who hoped to earn the favour of Kiyomori by sending him the head of his misguided master.</p>  
<p>His wife, Tokiwa Gozen, who had once been a consort of the Emperor Konoe, and had escaped with her three children from the massacre in which her husband had perished, sacrificed her own person to the vindictive Kiyomori, in order thereby to save the three children whom she had borne to Yoshitomo. One of these children was Yoritomo; the other was Yoshitsune, the favourite hero of Japanese history and romance.</p>  
<p>Yoritomo was about thirteen years old when his father died. His mother's self-sacrifice induced Kiyomori to spare him; but he was banished to Izu, where he did not behave very well; though he managed to secure the affections of his guardian's daughter, the beautiful and capable Masa-ko, who ran away from home to join her lover on the outbreak of his war against the Taira, and who may be said to have laid the foundations of the H&#333;j&#333;</p>  
<p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="green">p. 276</font></A></p>  
<p>family, by procuring for her father the nomination to the office of Regent (Shikken). Yoritomo's arms were successful; he and his associates defeated the Taira partisans at Ichi-no-tani (1184), at Yashima (1184), and finally at Dan-no-ura (1185), after which he found himself practically master of Japan, being invested in 1192 with the title of <i>Sei-i-tai Sh&#333;gun</i>, a title which for seven successive centuries continued to designate the personage in whose hands nominally lay the practical administrative and military power in Japan.</p>  
<p>But long before that, in the early part of his campaigns, after his defeat at Ishibashiyama in 1181, he had (under H&#333;j&#333; Tokimasa's advice) made Kamakura his headquarters, and had there organized the <i>samurai</i> who rallied round the Minamoto standard into a compact military body, which assured to him the victory over his rivals throughout Japan. The Kamakura Bakufu&#8212;a state within a state&#8212;organized by the genius of H&#333;j&#333; Tokimasa&#8212;was to the rest of Japan in those days what Prussia was to the rest of Germany in 1866, better organized, better drilled, better disciplined, and it was thanks to the H&#333;j&#333; genius that the Minamoto secured the hegemony of the Empire.</p>  
<p>When Yoritomo died, in 1199, his widow, Masako, who knew the impetuous stormy character of the Minamoto family, took precautions to preserve from destruction the system which her father at Kamakura had elaborated with so much care and forethought. Yoritomo's son, Yoriie, was indeed put in his father's place, and in 1202 invested with the title of Sei-i-tai-sh&#333;gun; but he was restricted in his liberty by a Council of State, appointed to assist him in his functions, and the chairman of that Council was H&#333;j&#333; Tokimasa, who now received the title of Shikken, or Regent. The Sh&#333;gunate soon passed out</p>  
<p><a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="green">p. 277</font></A></p>  
<p>of the feeble hands of Yoritomo's descendants; but the H&#333;j&#333; Regents still continued to exercise their power in the name of the puppet-Sh&#333;guns, whom they themselves nominated. Japan thus beheld the spectacle of an Emperor the whole of whose administrative powers had devolved upon a Sh&#333;gun, who, again, was but a puppet, with all his functions usurped by a Regent who ruled in the Sh&#333;gun's name. Theoretically, nothing could be conceived more hopeless than this extremely anomalous arrangement of the government. Practically, the system worked with fair smoothness for over a century, from A.D. 1200 to 1333. The H&#333;j&#333; Regents were on the whole men of ability, power, and uprightness (as uprightness was reckoned in those difficult days), and brought the ship of State to a safe haven through some most dangerous storms. But they had nothing to recommend them except their own personal qualities. Takatoki, the ninth and last of the Regents, was weak and dissolute, and his enemies promptly seized the opportunity to overthrow the H&#333;j&#333; house. The Emperor Godaigo was a strong man, and powerfully supported by the Tendai monks from Hieizan. For a brief space the Imperial House became the ruling power; the Regency was abolished, the puppet-Sh&#333;guns disappeared, and a new succession of actual Sh&#333;guns (of the Ashikaga House) was inaugurated in 1338, residing once more in Ky&#333;to. The day of Kamakura was over.</p>  
<p>The H&#333;j&#333; Regents were by no means indifferent to the claims of religion. But theirs was a military organization, supported by all that was best and most practical among the military classes of Japan, and neither Tendai, Shingon, nor J&#333;do was robust enough to attract the spirit of a true soldier (for the term "soldier" could scarcely be applied to the fighting men who fattened on the revenues of the Hieizan and similar temples, and fought the battles</p>  
<p><a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="green">p. 278</font></A></p>  
<p>of the worldly priests). The H&#333;j&#333; found in the Zen sects the particular form of Buddhism that suited them best.</p>  
<p>The Zen sects (there are three in Japan) derive their separate existence from a celebrated Indian priest, Bodhidharma, who arrived in China in the year 526 A.D., just two years before the foundation of the Benedictine Order in Europe.</p>  
<p>It was in India a period of religious strife and confusion. The Hindus were protesting, vigorously and successfully, against Mah&#257;y&#257;na and H&#299;nay&#257;na alike, and were gradually absorbing into their own systems all that was good in the Buddhist religion.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_386"></A><A HREF="#fn_384"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> A great opposition (we might better call it a persecution&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_387"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>) was being raised against the "sons of S&#8217;akyamuni," and many Buddhist priests found it convenient to leave India and seek refuge abroad. Many of them found their way to China, which was then divided into two rival kingdoms, of the north under the Wei, of the south under the Sung, with several minor principalities. Both dynasties favoured the Buddhist religion, partly, it may be presumed, for political reasons, and many embassies came from India and Central Asia to ask for the assistance of China, the leading Buddhist power in Asia. The prince of the Wei, like Sh&#333;toku Taishi, lectured publicly on Buddhism, but his Confucianist subjects observed that his Buddhist principles did not prevent him from waging an active war against the neighbouring principality of the Liang. In the early years of the sixth century it was estimated</p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="green">p. 279</font></A></p>  
<p>that there were over three thousand refugee Indian missionaries at work in China. It was observed with concern that there was a tremendous multiplication of Mah&#257;y&#257;na books, many of them evidently spurious, and the rapid spread of magical arts among the Buddhists was very rightly viewed as a matter of very ill omen. The early "harmonists" (as they may be called) were trying to bring order out of the chaos by constructing schemes of S&#8217;akyamuni's life and ministry which might embrace the whole of this wide cycle of doctrines and scriptures. The predecessors of Chisha Daishi, the founder of the Chinese Tendai, were already hard at work in framing their philosophy of religion. But the temporal authorities of the time had other and more drastic measures. In A.D. 515 the rulers of the Wei put to death a number of Chinese Buddhist priests for practising magical arts; in 518 the Wei Government dispatched two commissioners to India to report on religion and bring back authentic books; and in 526 Bodhidharma arrived to put things in order.</p>  
<p>Bodhidharma was no ordinary priest. He was esteemed amongst the Buddhists as the twenty-eighth Patriarch of their Church, as the legitimate successor of the first Apostles of S&#8217;akyamuni, the rightful occupant of the chair in which Mah&#257;ka&#347;yapa had sat in the first Council immediately after the Master's death. Troubles in India had undoubtedly something to do with Bodhidharma's visit to China; but, apart from that, he had undoubtedly also come to fulfil a mission of reform. His visit to China had very much the same significance as would have that of an Archbishop of Canterbury who should undertake a "mission of help" to the Anglican Missions in Japan.</p>  
<p>He was a man of strong will and character. He did</p>  
<p><a name="page_280"><font size="1" color="green">p. 280</font></A></p>  
<p>not stoop to flatter kings. When he first met the Emperor Wu of the Sung Dynasty, the Emperor began to speak of the good works that he had done. "I have built many temples," he said, "and endowed thousands of priests. What merit have I acquired?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_388"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> "None at all," was the priest's blunt reply. The man who would thus address an Emperor was not likely to spare his own religious household. He sat in the Chair once occupied by As&#8217;vaghosha, N&#257;g&#257;rjuna, Vasubandhu, and the great Doctors whose names have come before us so often in the course of this history, but he would not recognize as genuine the many works that claimed to come from their pens.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_389"></A><A HREF="#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> "You cannot get Buddhism from books," was his contention. "If you want Enlightenment you must get it as S&#8217;akyamuni did, as the great Ka&#347;yapa did, as N&#257;g&#257;rjuna and Vasubandhu did&#8212;by meditation. Books will only tell you about it&#8212;meditation and contemplation will <i>procure</i> it for you." And he established a discipline of contemplation which may be compared with the spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius Loyola.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> <i>Zazen</i>, as the Japanese call it, is a very difficult course of contemplations, with suggestions from the spiritual director which furnish topics and hints, but no more. When the postulant has got through the course, he may have obtained Enlightenment, or he may not; he has, at any rate, gone through a course of mental discipline which has given him to some extent the mind of a soldier.</p>  
<p>Such was the Buddhism which the H&#333;j&#333; Regents called to their aid when they were engaged in making Kamakura the military centre of a reformed Japan. The Contemplative Teaching had, it is true, been for some time in the country, under the name of the Busshinsh&#363;, or Sect of Buddha's Heart, but it had been too Puritanic to find favour with the courtiers of Nara or Ky&#333;to. In the year 1201, when Yoriie, the son of Yoritomo, was Sh&#333;gun, with his widowed mother Masako as the power behind the throne, and her father H&#333;j&#333; Masamune as Regent and Head of the Kamakura Bakufu, Eisai Zenshi, the founder of the Rinzai Sect of the Zen, was invited to establish himself, first in Ky&#333;to at the Kenninji, and afterwards at Kenk&#333;ji in Kamakura. A few years later, between 1222 and 1232, Sh&#333;y&#333; Daishi, or D&#333;gen, as he was known to his contemporaries, founded the sister sect of the S&#333;t&#333; which has its headquarters in the province of Echizen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_390"></A><A HREF="#fn_388"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The <i>Rinzai</i> and the <i>S&#333;t&#333;</i>, both of which came to Japan from the south of China, differ in this, that the former depends wholly and entirely on contemplation as the sole means of obtaining saving Enlightenment, while the latter adds the use of books as subsidiary aids. A translation of the chief manual used by the Zen will be found in the published transactions of the Oxford Congress of the</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> History of Religions (1908); when, some twenty-five years ago, I asked a S&#333;t&#333; priest to give me instruction, he began his lectures by a course of expositions of the Hannya Shingy&#333;, or <i>Par&#257;mita Hridaya S&#363;tra</i>. Nearly all the S&#333;t&#333; priests whom I have known have been learned men; I think I may say the same of all the Rinzai priests with whom I have become acquainted. It is difficult to talk with them on purely spiritual issues, because they hold that Truth is not communicated orally from mouth to ear, but, without the intermediary of words, by a kind of wireless telegraphy from heart to heart. <i>Zen wa zeni nashi, Monto mono wo shiradzu</i>. "The Zen priests have no money," says the proverb, "the Monto (Shinshu) priests no understanding."</p>  
<p>The Zen sects have always been more or less influenced by Confucianism. Indeed, I have heard them described as being more Confucianist than Buddhist&#8212;au obvious exaggeration of facts. But the Zen monks sat loose to the teachings of the S&#363;tras, which their: first Founder had taught them to look on with suspicion, and in their office as teachers they required some mental food to take the place of the discredited books.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_391"></A><A HREF="#fn_389"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Confucianism had never been looked upon in Japan as being antagonistic to Buddhism, and K&#333;b&#333; Daishi (even if it was not Sh&#333;toku) had spoken of Buddhism, Taoism (Shinto), and Confucianism as the three legs of the tripod on which rested the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_283"><font size="1" color="green">p. 283</font></A></p>  
<p>religious and temporary welfare of Japan. Confucianism had from the earliest times in historical Japan been looked upon as the religious philosophy of the man-at-arms or the man of affairs, and the bid which, under the patronage of the H&#333;j&#333; Regents, the Zenshu teachers made for the suffrages of the samurai was likely to be all the more acceptable if it came strongly seasoned with a Confucianist flavour. The establishment of the Zen corresponded with the entry into China of the improved and refined Confucianism of the Chinese reformer Ch&#363;hi, or Shushi (to give him his Japanese name), and the two systems may be said to have made common cause in their attempts to influence the religious thought of the military and governing classes.</p>  
<p>Perhaps the most picturesque figure in the Zen world is that of H&#333;j&#333; Tokiyori, the fifth of the Kamakura Regents, who held office from 1246 to 1256, and then retired into a monastery, being henceforth known as Saimy&#333;ji Ny&#363;d&#333;. But his retirement was not in the least like those of the poor Emperors and Sh&#333;guns at Ky&#333;t&#333;, who were dropped from the ship for fear they should want to take part in the management of the vessel of State. Tokiyori knew that, as Regent, it was very difficult for him to learn the true state of the country. He could only make State progresses along roads carefully swept and cleaned for his reception, to see just what the local authorities wanted him to see. And the times made it imperative for the men at the helm of State to have accurate and trustworthy knowledge. Tokiyori accordingly resigned his Regency in favour of his young son Tokimune, whom he left in the care of trustworthy ministers,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_390"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> donned</p>

<p><a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="green">p. 284</font></A></p>  
<p>the priestly habit, and started off on an unofficial tour of inspection. He learned a very great deal, and, returning to Kamakura, placed the information he had gained at the disposal of his son and successor. The information was most valuable, for Japan was about to pass through one of the most severe crises in her national history&#8212;a crisis of which I shall speak in a subsequent chapter.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The Zen system touches the philosophic thought of India very closely. It has also many points of contact with Confucianism. It recognizes a supreme Being; but absolutely refuses to personify Him. To personify God, says the Zenshuist, whether as Vairoc&#8217;ana, as Amida, as S&#8217;akyamuni, or as Jehovah, is to limit Him. He cannot be tied up to any form; He transcends the widest, highest, deepest conceptions of the human mind. Yet the Zen does not blame those who thus personify God and by personifying limit Him. It recognizes that for certain minds personification is a necessity. The Infinite mind must become Finite, in order that the Finite mind may grasp it. But a personified God is nothing but a h&#333;ben, an adaptation of the Truth to the weakness of the human intellect. Such personification, it has been observed, always serves to narrow the mind and make it intolerant. The Jew, the Mahometan, the Christian, the worshipper of Amida, of S&#8217;akyamuni, of Vairoc&#8217;ana&#8212;all in turn have become dogmatic, intolerant, uncharitable, and all for the same reason. They start from a personal, and therefore an imperfect, conception of God.</p>  
<p>In the same way, the Zen possesses no Canon of Scripture. The Christian has his Bible, the Mahometan his Koran, every sect of Buddhism has formed its own little Canon of Holy Books out of the unwieldy mass of the Tripitaka. The formation of a canon leads to loss of</p>  
<p><a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="green">p. 285</font></A></p>  
<p>charity. Certain books are taken as representing a divine revelation; all other books of religion are judged by this arbitrary standard, and whatever does not agree with it is rejected. The letter of Scripture has always proved to be a fruitful mother of controversy and dissension. The Zen has no special list of Sacred Books. It does not reject any S&#363;tras or Abhidharmas; it reads and values them for all the truths they contain, but it sets up no books as being infallible or beyond criticism. It criticizes freely all the Sacred Books of Buddhism; and it accepts, with equal freedom and reverence, the good books of all countries.</p>  
<p>It has been said already that Zen, whilst rejecting a personal God, accepts with reverence a Something Beyond Knowledge, which lies at the back of phenomenal existence. We can never know that Being in its entirety, but we can reach to Him in three ways&#8212;"feeling after Him, and, haply, finding Him." We may look into our own hearts, by introspection and meditation, and there we shall find Him. We may look into the hearts of others by means of the Word, spoken or written, and there we shall find Him. We may look at Nature, in all its manifestations, romantic or commonplace, and there we shall find Him. For my heart is Buddha; and the heart of my brother whose books I read, is Buddha; and Nature in its entirety, the Infinitely Great, the Infinitely Small, every star or comet, every mountain range or ocean, every insect, every leaf, is Buddha.</p>  
<p>Such is the faith of the Zenshuist. For his daily conduct he accepts no infallible guide but his own enlightened conscience, which is one with the enlightened conscience of the universe. For the details, however, of his behaviour he will follow Confucius, S&#8217;akyamuni, Epictetus, anything that will help him to lead his daily life in a manner worthy of a religious philosopher.</p>  
<p><a name="page_286"><font size="1" color="green">p. 286</font></A></p>  
<p>The Zen, as taught by its Japanese founders, Eisai and D&#333;gen, and as fostered by the wise counsels of the H&#333;j&#333; regents, was quite a different religion from the miracle-mongering, worldly, intriguing parody of religion which the Hoss&#333;, Kegon, Tendai, and Shingon had been palming off on the country to the obvious disgust of the warrior and the man of action. It was very different, again, from the pietistic solifidianism of Honen and Shinran, with its contempt for this world and its fixed gaze upon the joys of the Western Paradise. The Zen fired the imagination of the warrior, the statesman, the man of letters, and if Japanese art drew its inspiration from the wild fancies of Kegon and Shingon Buddhology, Japanese poetry drew it from the solid quietude of the Zen monasteries, where it was taught to look "within," into the heart and into the innermost shrine of Nature, and there to be comforted by the One, Omnipresent, Heart of Buddha, whom man can feel but not know.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_393"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
