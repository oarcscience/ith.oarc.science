<p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> first five of these commandments&#8212;not to take life, not to steal, not to commit unchastity, not to tell lies, not to drink intoxicants&#8212;are binding on all laymen. The whole ten are binding on the brotherhood, and in their case the third rule means absolute celibacy. But the pious layman may take upon himself three more in addition to the first five. Those three&#8212;not eating after noon, not witnessing dancing, shows, and plays, not using ornaments, scents, and unguents&#8212;are usually taken on the fast-days, and are only binding for the day on which they are assumed. Details as to the rules and organization of the Order will be found in <i>The Way of the Buddha</i> of Mr. H. Baynes in the same series as the present volume.</small></p>
