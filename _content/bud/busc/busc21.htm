<p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">As</span> Buddhism did not deny the gods, but only their eternity, so it did not deny the existence of the other superhuman beings of Indian mythology. Such beings in the older Hinduism, like the guardian angels and ministering spirits of Christianity, might exert great influence over an individual's life. All round him the Buddhist saw the power of magic which could ward off enemies, cure diseases, or bring good luck; and he did not succeed in casting off all belief in spells and incantations. By appealing to the spirits in the name of the Triple Jewel&#8212;Buddha, the Doctrine, and the Order&#8212;he might win their good influence, and even conversion, and, by making offerings to them as alms, would certainly acquire merit.</small></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">All</span> spirits whatever that are here assembled,<br> That haunt the earth, or through the air are passing,<br> Let all those spirits be well-disposed and kindly,<br> So may they hear this utterance with attention.</p>  
<p>Therefore attend and hearken, all ye spirits,<br> Show kindness to the race of human beings,<br> Who bring by day and night to you their offerings,<br> Therefore with vigilance grant them your protection.</p>  
<p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></A></p>  
<p>Whatever wealth there may be here or yonder,<br> Or any perfect jewel in the heavens,<br> In no wise is it equal to the Buddha&#8212;<br> In the Buddha is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>Absence of lust, desire, the immortal, perfect<br> Doctrine the Sakya Sage attained, the perfect one,<br> Nought verily is there equal to that Doctrine&#8212;<br> In the Doctrine is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>The purity which the best of Buddhas lauded,<br> The meditation called uninterrupted,<br> Nought is there equal to that meditation&#8212;<br> In the Doctrine is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>The persons eight,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> commended by the righteous,<br> Who form four pairs, worthy are they of offerings.<br> They hear the teaching of the blessed Master,<br> Great is the fruit of gifts to them presented&#8212;<br> In the Order is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>They who with firm mind have applied themselves,<br> Free from desire, to Gotama's instructions,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></A></p>  
<p>Their end attained, have gone to the immortal,<br> Taking the free gift, and enjoy Nirvana&#8212;<br> In the Order is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>Like as a pillar at a city's threshold,<br> Firm in the ground, by the four winds unshaken,<br> So I affirm is the good man unshaken,<br> Who pondering on the noble truths perceives them<br> In the Order is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>They who the noble truths have comprehended,<br> The truths well-taught by the profoundly Wise One,<br> They, even though they be exceeding slothful,<br> Not to the eighth re-birth will be subjected&#8212;<br> In the Order is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>He verily, when he attains to insight,<br> Three things he wholly leaves behind and loses:<br> False theory of the self, uncertainty,<br> And all there is of ceremonial practice.<br> From the four hells that person is delivered,<br> Nor can he then the six great crimes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> commit&#8212;</p>

<p>In the Order is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>Whatever act of wickedness the bhikkhu<br> In deed, or word, or thinking, has committed,<br> Impossible for him is its concealment,<br> Impossible for him who has seen the path&#8212;<br> In the Order is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>As in a forest grove with tops in flower<br> In the first month, and in the first hot season,<br> So did he teach the best supremest doctrine,<br> The highest truth that leadeth to Nirvana&#8212;<br> In the Buddha is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>The Best One, he who knows, gives, brings the best,<br> The Highest taught the best supremest doctrine&#8212;<br> In the Buddha is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>  
<p>"Destroyed is the old,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the new has not arisen."<br> They with their thought not set on future being,<br> The seeds destroyed, desire not germinated,<br> Like as this lamp the wise are thus extinguished&#8212;<br> In the Order is this jewel of perfection,<br> So through this truth to us may there be welfare.</p>
