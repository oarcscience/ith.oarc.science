### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_4">p. 4</span>

<span id="page_4_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_4_fr_*) Avoid *or* abandon.

<span id="footnotes_page_6">p. 6</span>

<span id="page_6_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_6_fr_*) སོ་བ་ = a watchman.
སོ་བ་མཁན་ is said to be one who watches or looks after something, hence
(here) a gardener.

<span id="page_6_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_6_fr_dagger) Such
five-line verses are rare in this book. སྨད་འཚོང་ = selling the lower
(part of the body), hence prostitution.

<span id="footnotes_page_10">p. 10</span>

<span id="page_10_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_10_fr_*) This refers to the
story of a man who was threading pearls in a room on the wall of which
there was a painting of a peacock. The peacock came out of the picture
and swallowed the pearls but no one would believe his story. (D.S.).

<span id="page_10_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_10_fr_dagger) The
Tibetans say that this is still done by hunters.

<span id="page_10_note_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_10_fr_ddagger) A
synonym for ཡིད་བཞིན་ནོར་བུ the usual name of the wishing gem. (Ge-she).

<span id="footnotes_page_12">p. 12</span>

<span id="page_12_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_12_fr_*) D.S. prefers "Pride
and violence."

<span id="page_12_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_12_fr_dagger) i.e., he
is risking his life.

<span id="page_12_note_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_12_fr_ddagger) The
Ge-she Ka-chen Töndrup says that this is read to mean "May I not see"
etc.

<span id="footnotes_page_14">p. 14</span>

<span id="page_14_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_14_fr_*) The last two lines
are obscure. They are compressed into one line in the S.C.D. edition but
now stand as given in the P.T.

<span id="page_14_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_14_fr_dagger) He prefers
the life of a hermit.

<span id="page_14_note_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_14_fr_ddagger) The last
two lines are obscure. The translation given above is my own, based on
the text as it stands. The Ge-she considers that the text is corrupt and
proposes to alter the third line to འཛད་དང་མཁྲས་ etc., and translate
these lines as--

Exhaustion, substraction and want of development.  
(Therefore) remain in forgetfulness in the midst of it all.

བགཡ་ངས་ is now used colloquially to mean forgetfulness but I am inclined
to think that it must be taken to mean 'modest' here.

<span id="footnotes_page_16">p. 16</span>

<span id="page_16_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_16_fr_*) Cf. the story in
the འངུལ་བ་ volume ག་ leaf 165. The fox bit the bow string and was
killed by the poisoned arrow.

<span id="page_16_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_16_fr_dagger) The two
last lines of this verse are very obscure. They are possibly a reference
to some story. The Ge she's explanation is to the effect that the curds
are a reference to churning, and that the lines mean that a man who
churns pays no heed to the butter already produced, but thinks of the
butter to come.

<span id="footnotes_page_18">p. 18</span>

<span id="page_18_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_18_fr_*) This refers to a
story of Sanskrit origin. The noise caused by the fall of the 'bel'
fruit frightened the smaller animals who communicated their fear to the
larger, thus causing the forest to be deserted.

<span id="page_18_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_18_fr_dagger) i.e. he
remains on his guard.

<span id="footnotes_page_20">p. 20</span>

<span id="page_20_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_20_fr_*) For བསྒྲུངས་ read
གྲུང་ clever or pushing. The first form is unknown the dictionares.

<span id="page_20_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_20_fr_dagger) i.e.
whatever you do you cannot please everybody.

<span id="footnotes_page_22">p. 22</span>

<span id="page_22_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_22_fr_*) i.e. really of
