| 48\. And one of the leech                                         | "       | 19  |
| 49\. And three of the serpent                                     | "       | 20  |

### 1. THE ASS.

2\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the harsh-voiced ass which
you say he ought to take, which is that?'

'Just, O king, as the ass, wheresoever he may lie down--whether on a
dust heap, or in the open space where four roads meet, or three <span
id="fr_685"></span>[1](#fn_676), or at the entrance to a village, or on
a heap of straw--\[**366**\]--nowhere is he given to resting long; just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort <span
id="fr_686"></span>[2](#fn_677), wheresoever he may spread out his mat
for repose--whether on strewed grass, or leaves, or on a bed of thorns,
or on the bare earth--nowhere should he be given to sloth. This is the
one quality of the ass he ought to have. For this has been said, O king,
by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:

Sleeping on pillows of chaff, my disciples, O brethren,  
Keep themselves earnest and ardent in strenuous fight <span
id="fr_687"></span>[3](#fn_678)."

 

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

'And this too, O king, was said by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander
of the Faith:

"If it but raineth not knee-deep on him  
When sitting in high meditations plunged--  
What cares the man on Arahatship intent for ease <span
id="fr_688"></span>[1](#fn_679)!"

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 2. THE COCK.

3\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of the cock which you say
he ought to take, what are they?'

'Just, O king, as a cock goes early and betimes to roost; so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, early and betimes sweep
out the open space around the Dâgaba, and having got ready <span
id="fr_689"></span>[2](#fn_680) the drinking-water for the day's use,
and dressed himself <span id="fr_690"></span>[3](#fn_681), and taken his
bath, he should bow

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

down in reverence before the Dâgaba, and then pay visits to the senior
Bhikshus, and, on his return, enter in due time into the chamber of
solitude. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the cock he
ought to have.

4\. 'And again, O king, as a cock rises early and betimes; so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rise early and betimes
to sweep out the open space around the Dâgaba, and get ready the
drinking-water for the day's use, and dress himself, and pay his daily
reverence to the Dâgaba, and enter into the chamber of solitude. This, O
king, is the second of the qualities of the cock he ought to have.

5\. 'And again, O king, as the cock is unremitting in scratching the
earth to pick up what he can find to eat; so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, practise continual
self-examination and circumspection in taking any nourishment he may
find to eat, reminding himself: \[**367**\] "I eat this, seeking not
after pleasure, nor after excitement, nor after beauty of body, nor
after elegance of form, but merely for the preservation of my body, to
keep myself alive, as a means of appeasing the pain of hunger, and of
assisting me in the practice of the higher life. Thus shall I put an end
to all former sorrow, and give no cause for future sorrow to arise;
therein shall I be free from blame, and dwell at ease." This, O king, is
the third of the qualities of the cock he ought to have. For it has been
said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:

"Like child's flesh in the desert wild,  
Or smearing grease upon the wheel, <span id="page_282">p. 282</span>  
Solely to keep himself alive,  
Does he, when feeling faint, take food <span
id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_682)."

6\. 'And again, O king, as the cock, though it has eyes, is blind by
night; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
though he is not blind, be as one blind. Whether in the woods, or on his
daily walk for alms in search of food, blind should he be and deaf and
dumb to all delights of form, or sound, or taste, or smell, or touch,
should not make them the objects of his thought, should pay no special,
detailed, attention to them <span id="fr_692"></span>[2](#fn_683). This,
O king, is the fourth of the qualities of the cock he ought to have. For
it was said, O king, by Mahâ Ka*kk*âyana, the Elder:

"Let him with eyes be as one blind,  
And he who hears be as the deaf, <span id="page_283">p. 283</span>  
   He who can speak be as the dumb,  
   The man of strength as were he weak.  
As each new object rises to his ken,  
On the sweet couch of blest Nirvâ*n*a's peace  
       Let him lie down and rest <span id="fr_693"></span>[1](#fn_684)."

7\. 'And again, O king, as the cock, even though persecuted <span
id="fr_694"></span>[2](#fn_685) with clods and sticks and clubs <span
id="fr_695"></span>[3](#fn_686) and cudgels, will not desert his home;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort,--whether he be engaged in robemaking or in building-work, or in
any of his daily duties, or in teaching, or in receiving
instruction <span id="fr_696"></span>[4](#fn_687)--never give up his
presence of mind. For that, O king--his presence of mind--is the home in
which he dwells. This, O king, is the fifth of the qualities of the cock
he ought to have. \[368\] And this, O king, has been said by the Blessed
One, the god over all gods <span id="fr_697"></span>[5](#fn_688):

"And which, O Bhikshus, is the Bhikshu's resort, the realm which is his
own by right?--it is this, the four modes of being mindful and
thoughtful <span id="fr_698"></span>[6](#fn_689)."

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

'And this too, O king, has been said by Sâriputta, the Elder, the
Commander of the Faith:

"The elephant distinguishes good food  
From bad, he knows what gives him sustenance,  
And even when asleep he guards his trunk <span
id="fr_699"></span>[1](#fn_690)--  
So let each Buddha's son, earnest in zeal,  
Never do violence to the Conqueror's word,  
Nor injury to his self-possession, best of gifts <span
id="fr_700"></span>[2](#fn_691)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 3. THE SQUIRREL.

8\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the squirrel which you say
he ought to take, which is that?'

'Just as the squirrel, O king, when an enemy falls upon him, beats his
tail on the ground till it swells, and then with his own tail as a
cudgel drives off the foe; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when his enemy, sin, falls upon him, beat
the cudgel of his self-possession till it swells, and then by the cudgel
of self-possession drive all evil inclinations off. This, O king, is the
one quality of the squirrel which he ought to have. For it was said, O
king, by *K*ulla Panthaka, the Elder:

"When sins, those fell destroyers of the gains  
Gained by the life of recluse, fall on us,  
They should be slain, again and yet again,  
By resolute self-possession as a club <span
id="fr_701"></span>[3](#fn_692)."'

 

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

### 4. THE PANTHER (FEMALE) <span id="fr_702"></span>[1](#fn_693).

9\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the female of the panther
which you say he ought to take, which is that?'

'Just, O king, as the female of the panther conceives only once, and
does not resort again and again to the male <span
id="fr_703"></span>[2](#fn_694); just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort,--seeing how future conceptions and births
involve a period of gestation and a fall from each state as it is
reached, and dissolution and death and destruction, seeing the horrors
of transmigration and of rebirths in evil states, the annoyance of them,
the torment of them,--he should stedfastly resolve never to enter upon
any future life. \[**369**\] This, O king, is the one quality of the
female panther which he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the
Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Sutta Nipâta, in the Sutta of
Dhaniya the cowherd:

"Like a strong bull who's burst the bonds that bound him,  
Or elephant who's forced his way through jungle,  
Thus shall I never more enter the womb--  
And now, if it so please you, god, rain on <span
id="fr_704"></span>[3](#fn_695)!"'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 5. THE PANTHER (MALE).

10\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the panther which you
say he ought to take, which are they?'

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

'Just, O king, as the panther, lying in ambush in wild places, behind a
thicket of long grass or brushwood, or among the rocks, catches the
deer; so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
resort to solitary places in the woods, at the foot of a tree, on
mountain heights, in caves and grottoes, in cemeteries, in forests,
under the open sky, on beds of straw, in quiet, noiseless spots, free
from strong winds, and hid from the haunts of men. For the strenuous
Bhikshu, O king, earnest in effort, who frequents such solitudes, will
soon become master of the six forms of transcendent insight. This, O
king, is the first of the qualities of the panther he ought to have. For
it was said, O king, by the Elders who collected the scriptures:

"As the panther by lying in ambush catches the deer,  
So the sons of the Buddha, with insight and earnestness armed,  
By resorting to solitudes gain that Fruit which is best <span
id="fr_705"></span>[1](#fn_696)."

11\. 'And again, O king, as the panther, whatever may be the beast he
has killed, will never eat it if it has fallen on the left side; just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, not partake
of any food that has been procured by gifts of bamboos, or palms'
leaves, or flowers, or fruits, or baths <span
id="fr_706"></span>[2](#fn_697), or chunam, or tooth-sticks, \[**370**\]
or water for washing; or by flattery, or by gaining the laity over by
sugared

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

words (literally by pea-soup-talk), suppressing the truth and suggesting
the false <span id="fr_707"></span>[1](#fn_698), or by petting their
children <span id="fr_708"></span>[2](#fn_699), or by taking messages as
he walks from house to house <span id="fr_709"></span>[3](#fn_700), or
by doctoring them, or by acting as a go-between, or as a messenger on
matters of business or ceremony <span id="fr_710"></span>[4](#fn_701),
or by exchanging with them things he has received as alms, or by giving
back again to them as bribes robes or food once given to him <span
id="fr_711"></span>[5](#fn_702), or by giving them hints as to lucky
sites, or lucky days, or lucky signs (on their children's bodies at
birth), or by any other of those wrong modes of obtaining a livelihood
that have been condemned by the Buddha <span
id="fr_712"></span>[6](#fn_703)--no food so procured should he eat, as
the panther will not eat any prey that has fallen on its left side. This
is the second of the qualities of the panther he ought to have. For it
was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:

"This food, so sweet, has been procured  
Through intimation given by speech.  
Were I, then, to partake thereof,  
My mode of livelihood would be blamed. <span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

Now though by hunger dire oppressed  
My stomach seem to rise, to go,  
Ne'er will I break my rule of life,  
Not though my life I sacrifice <span id="fr_713"></span>[1](#fn_704)."'

### 6. THE TORTOISE.

12\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of the tortoise which you
say he ought to take, what are they? '

'Just, O king, as the tortoise, which is a water animal, keeps to the
water; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
let his heart go out over the whole wide world with pity and with
love--mighty, abounding, beyond measure, free from every feeling of
hatred or of malice--towards all creatures that have life <span
id="fr_714"></span>[2](#fn_705). This, O king, is the first of the
qualities of the tortoise he ought to have.

13\. 'And again, O king, just as the tortoise, when, as he swims on the
water and raises his head, he catches sight of any one, that moment
sinks, and dives into the depths, lest they should see him again; just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when evil
inclinations fall upon him, sink into the waters of meditation, dive
down into the deeps thereof, lest those evil inclinations should catch
sight of him again. This, O king, is the

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

second of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have.

14\. \[**371**\] 'And again, O king, just as the tortoise gets up out of
the water, and suns himself; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when he rouses himself (withdraws his mind)
out of meditation,--whether taken sitting, or lying down, or standing,
or walking up and down,--sun his mind in the Great Struggle against evil
dispositions. This, O king, is the third of the qualities of the
tortoise he ought to have.

15\. 'And again, O king, just as the tortoise, digging a hole in the
ground, dwells alone; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu,
earnest in effort, giving up worldly gain and honour and praise, take up
his abode alone, plunging into the solitudes of empty lonely places in
the groves and woods and hills, in caves and grottoes, noiseless and
quiet. This, O king, is the fourth of the qualities of the tortoise he
ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upasena, the Elder, of the
sons of the Va<u>n</u>gantas:

"Lonely and quiet places, haunts  
   Of the deer, and of wild beasts,  
Should the Bhikshu seek as his abode,  
   For solitude's sweet sake <span id="fr_715"></span>[1](#fn_706)."

16\. 'And again, O king, as the tortoise, when on his rounds he sees any
one, draws in at once all his head and limbs into his shell, and hiding
them there, keeps still in silence to save himself; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, wheresoever forms, or
sounds, or odours, or tastes,

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

or feelings strike upon him, shut to the gate of self-restraint at the
six doors of his senses, cover up his mind in self-control, and continue
constant in mindfulness and thoughtfulness to save his Samanaship. This,
O king, is the fifth of the qualities of the tortoise he ought to have.
For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in
the most excellent Sa*m*yutta Nikâya, in the Sutta of the parable of the
tortoise:

"As the tortoise withdraws his limbs in his shell,  
Let the Bhikshu bury the thoughts of his mind,  
Himself Independent, injuring none,  
Set free himself, speaking evil of none <span
id="fr_716"></span>[1](#fn_707)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 7. THE BAMBOO.

17\. \[**372**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the bamboo
which you say he ought to take, which is it?,

'Just, O king, as the bamboo, whithersoever the gale blows, to that
quarter does it bend accordingly, pursuing no other way of its own; just
so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, conduct
himself in accordance with the ninefold teaching of the Master, the word
of the Buddha, the Blessed One, and stedfastly keeping to all things
lawful and blameless, he should seek after the qualities of the
Sama*n*aship itself. This, O king, is the one quality of the bamboo he
ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Râhula, the Elder:

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

"In accord alway with Buddha's ninefold word  
And stedfast in all lawful, blameless acts,  
I have passed beyond rebirth in evil states <span
id="fr_717"></span>[1](#fn_708)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 8. THE BOW.

18\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the bow which you say he
ought to have, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as a well-made and balanced bow bends equally from end to
end, and does not resist stiffly, like a post; just so, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, bend easily in accord with all
his brethren--whether elders, juniors, of medium seniority, or of like
standing with himself--and not repel them. This, O king, is the one
quality of the bow he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the
Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Vidhura Pu*nn*aka *G*âtaka:

"Let the wise bend as the bow, yield as the reed,  
Not be contrary. He shall dwell in the home of kings <span
id="fr_718"></span>[2](#fn_709)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 9. THE CROW.

19\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the crow that you say
he ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the crow goes about full of apprehension and
suspicion, \[**373**\] always on watch and guard; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, go about full of
apprehension and suspicion, always on watch and guard,

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

in full self-possession, with his senses under control. This, O king, is
the first of the qualities of the crow he ought to have.

20\. 'And again, O king, as the crow, whatever food he catches sight of,
eats it, sharing with his kind; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never omit to share with virtuous
co-religionists, and that without distinction of person or deliberation
as to quantity <span id="fr_719"></span>[1](#fn_710), whatever lawful
gifts he may have lawfully received, down even to the contents of his
begging-bowl. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the crow
he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the
Commander of the Faith:

"Whate'er they may present to me, austere in life,  
All that, just as it comes, do I divide  
With all, and I myself then take my food <span
id="fr_720"></span>[2](#fn_711)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 10. THE MONKEY.

21\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the monkey which you
say he ought to have, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the monkey, when about to take up his abode does so in
some such place as a mighty tree, in a lonely place covered all over
with branches, a sure place of refuge; just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, choose as the teacher under whom
to live a man modest, amiable, righteous, of beauty of character,
learned in tradition and in the scriptures, lovable, venerable, worthy
of

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

reverence, a speaker of profitable things, meek, clever in admonition,
in instruction, and in education, able to arouse, to incite, to
gladden <span id="fr_721"></span>[1](#fn_712)--such a friend should he
choose as teacher. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the
monkey he ought to have.

22\. 'And again, O king, as the monkey wanders about, and stands and
sits, always on trees, and, if he goes to sleep, spends the night on
them; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
stand and walk up and down thinking, \[**374**\] and lie down, and
sleep, in the forest, and there enjoy the sense of self-possession.
This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the monkey he ought to
have. For it has been said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the
Commander of the Faith:

"Walking, or standing, sitting, lying down,  
'Tis in the forest that the Bhikshu shines.  
To dwell in wildernesses far remote  
Has been exalted by the Buddhas all <span
id="fr_722"></span>[2](#fn_713)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here ends the First Chapter <span id="fr_723"></span>[3](#fn_714).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_673"></span>[277:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_682) The published text
carries the details of these similes no further than this. See the
remarks in the Introduction, pp. xxiv, xxv.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[278:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_683) *G*ambuka-sigâliyâ.
In *G*âtaka, No. 294, of Fausböll, the jackal is male. The reference
therefore here is to a kind of jackal named after the *G*ambu fruit.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[278:2](sbe3609.htm#fr_684)
*K*a<u>n</u>gavârakassa. See Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 142-4, and *G*âtaka,
V, 186, in both of which passages the Burmese MSS. read *k*a<u>n</u>ka-.
The Si*m*halese, p. 540, has perahan ka*d*ê.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[279:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_685) *K*atukke and
singhâ*t*ake. I follow Hîna*t*i-kumburê in the distinction he makes
between the meaning of these terms--satara and tun ma*m* sandhiyehi (p.
540).

<span id="fn_677"></span>[279:2](sbe3609.htm#fr_686) Yogî yogava*k*aro.
The rendering of these words is quite adequate, and has given me much
trouble. Neither 'yogee' nor 'devotee' can be used, for they both have
acquired connotations contradictory to what was in our author's mind. He
means the Buddhist Bhikshu belonging to that class among the Bhikshus
(by no means the majority) who had devoted themselves to a life of
systematic effort according to the Buddhist scheme of self-training. But
I have found it impossible to put into any English phrase sufficiently
short for the constant repetition of the two Pâli words any full and
accurate representation of all that they imply. See the note above on p.
43 of the Pâli, and *G*âtaka, vol. i, p. 303.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[279:3](sbe3609.htm#fr_687) Not traced as yet.
Mr. Trenckner prints the passage as <span id="page_280">p. 280</span>
prose, but it is clearly two verses with a slight corruption in the
first line. The point of the verses lies in the untranslateable pun of
the words upadhâna, 'pillow,' and padhâna, 'strenuous fight.' The word
etarahi seems to me suspect, and some such reading as
ka*l*i<u>n</u>garopadhânâ va would restore the metre, and at the same
time bring the play on the words more into prominence.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[280:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_688) This verse is found
in the Thera Gâthâ, No. 985. Hîna*t*i-kumburê takes the na in the first
line as a negative to abhivassati, and translates, 'So long as it does
not rain knee-deep on him, when sitting in meditation, what cares the
Bhikshu, who is bent on attaining Nirvâ*n*a, for ease!'--and this is, I
think, preferable to Mr. Trenckner's division of the words.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[280:2](sbe3609.htm#fr_689) That is,
'filtered;' perahâ nagâ tabâ, says the Si*m*halese, p. 541.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[280:3](sbe3609.htm#fr_690) Sarîra*m*
pa*t*i*g*aggitvâ, 'rested a little to remove the weariness of his body,'
says the Si*m*halese here, but adds below, § 4, siwuru hœnda.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[282:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_691) Not traced as yet.
The verse is a riddle based on two parables. Of these the first is
already published in the Samyutta Nikâya XII, 63, 5-8. It tells of a
father and mother who in the desert (and of course only with the object
of keeping themselves alive) ate their only child. The other is not yet
published, but Mr. Trenckner points out that it occurs in the 34th
Samyutta. Oiling wheels is done solely to keep the cart going. Compare
the dying Buddha's comparison of himself to a worn-out cart, which can
only with difficulty be made to move along. Like that, the body of the
Tathâgata can only with difficulty be kept a little longer going
('Buddhist Suttas,' p. 37).

As to the last word, I take it, with Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 542, to be
mu*kkh*ito, and not amu*kkh*ito as is printed in the text. That is also
the reading adopted by Fausböll at *G*âtaka II, 294, where the verses
are quoted.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[282:2](sbe3609.htm#fr_692) Na nimitta*m*
gahetabba*m* nânubya*ñg*ana*m* gahetabba*m*. On these common expressions
compare A<u>n</u>guttara I, 2, 6, &c.; Puggala Pa*ññ*atti II, 17, IV,
24, &c.; Dîgha II, 64, &c.; and Buddhaghosa as quoted in 'Vinaya Texts,'
II, 9. Hîna*t*i-kumburê only repeats the first, but explains the second
by nœwata nœwata wimasîme*m*.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[283:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_693) From Thera Gâthâ.
The Si*m*halese supports Mr. Trenckner in reading *g*ivhâv' in line
three, but on the other hand has (twice) mana-sâyika*m* for
mata-sâyika*m*. For the last line, of which a literal translation is
impossible, it says, 'Let him make his couch on, fix his attention on,
that Nirvâ*n*a which is mana-sâyika-*k*itta.' I think mata is the right
reading, and that very possibly a riddle or pun is intended on the two
meanings of that word.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[283:2](sbe3609.htm#fr_694) Paripâtiyanto. See
above, p. 279 of the Pâli, and *G*âtaka II, 208. The Si*m*halese, p.
543, has he*l*anu labanneya.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[283:3](sbe3609.htm#fr_695) Laku*t*a. See
above, pp. 255, 301 of the Pâli, and compare the Hindî.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[283:4](sbe3609.htm#fr_696) Hîna*t*i-kumburê
expands all these details.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[283:5](sbe3609.htm#fr_697) In the Sa*m*yutta
Nikâya XLVI, 7. See Mr. Trenckner's note.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[283:6](sbe3609.htm#fr_698) The four
Satipa*tth*ânas. Compare above, p. 343 of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[284:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_699) As he does in war,
according to Ma*ggh*ima I, 415.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[284:2](sbe3609.htm#fr_700) Not traced as yet.
It is not included in the collection of Sâriputta's verses preserved in
the Thera Gâthâ.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[284:3](sbe3609.htm#fr_701) Not in the
published texts.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[285:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_702) Dîpinî, perhaps
'leopardess.' The Si*m*halese has 'tigress,' which is certainly wrong.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[285:2](sbe3609.htm#fr_703) Because it realises
the pains and sorrows of cub-bearing, says the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_695"></span>[285:3](sbe3609.htm#fr_704) Sutta Nipâta I, 2,
12.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[286:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_705) That is, of course,
Arahatship. The lines are not to be found in the published texts.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[286:2](sbe3609.htm#fr_706) Sinâna-dâneria;
omitted by the Sutta Vibhanga and by Hîna*t*i-kumburê (who quotes the
Pâli of this passage).

<span id="fn_698"></span>[287:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_707) Muggasuppatâ. So
Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 546. The Sutta Vibha<u>n</u>ga omits both this word
and the next.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[287:2](sbe3609.htm#fr_708) Pâribha*tt*akatâ.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[287:3](sbe3609.htm#fr_709)
*G*a<u>n</u>gha-pesaniyena. The Sutta Vibhanga I, 185, on which our
whole paragraph here is based, reads -pesanikena. I have differentiated
the three sorts of messages according to the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[287:4](sbe3609.htm#fr_710) Hîna*t*i-kumburê,
both in his transcription of the Pâli (p. 546) and in his translation
(p. 547), reads pahîna-gamana.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[287:5](sbe3609.htm#fr_711) Anuppadâna. Compare
*G*âtaka III, 205. At Sigâlovâda Sutta, p. 307, and Milinda, p. 315, it
means simply providing a person with things he wants. Childers's
rendering, 'giving,' is inadequate in all the passages.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[287:6](sbe3609.htm#fr_712) Referring to the
Sîlas.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[288:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_713) Not traced as yet.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê gives a long account of the circumstances under which
these verses were spoken. Sâriputta was ill. Moggallâna asked him what
would be good for him to take. Sâriputta told him. His friend then, by
intervention of the king of the gods, procured it. But Sâriputta refused
to make use of it.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[288:2](sbe3609.htm#fr_714) The Brahmâ-vihâras

<span id="fn_707"></span>[290:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_716) The parable is in
the 46th Samyutta. The verses are already published at vol. i, p. 7 of
M. Feer's edition for the Pâli Text Society.

verse 159.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[292:1](sbe3609.htm#fr_719) So Hîna*t*i-kumburê
understands this, his version agreeing with the quotation given by Mr.
Trenckner from Buddhaghosa.
