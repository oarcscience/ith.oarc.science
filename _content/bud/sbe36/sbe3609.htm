<P><A NAME="fn_673"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_682">277:1</A> The published text carries the details of these similes no further than this. See the remarks in the Introduction, pp. xxiv, xxv.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_674"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_683">278:1</A> <I>G</I>ambuka-sig&acirc;liy&acirc;. In <I>G</I>&acirc;taka, No. 294, of Fausb&ouml;ll, the jackal is male. The reference therefore here is to a kind of jackal named after the <I>G</I>ambu fruit.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_675"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_684">278:2</A> <I>K</I>a<U>n</U>gav&acirc;rakassa. See Ma<I>ggh</I>ima Nik&acirc;ya I, 142-4, and <I>G</I>&acirc;taka, V, 186, in both of which passages the Burmese MSS. read <I>k</I>a<U>n</U>ka-. The Si<I>m</I>halese, p. 540, has perahan ka<I>d</I>&ecirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_676"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_685">279:1</A> <I>K</I>atukke and singh&acirc;<I>t</I>ake. I follow H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; in the distinction he makes between the meaning of these terms--satara and tun ma<I>m</I> sandhiyehi (p. 540).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_677"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_686">279:2</A> Yog&icirc; yogava<I>k</I>aro. The rendering of these words is quite adequate, and has given me much trouble. Neither 'yogee' nor 'devotee' can be used, for they both have acquired connotations contradictory to what was in our author's mind. He means the Buddhist Bhikshu belonging to that class among the Bhikshus (by no means the majority) who had devoted themselves to a life of systematic effort according to the Buddhist scheme of self-training. But I have found it impossible to put into any English phrase sufficiently short for the constant repetition of the two P&acirc;li words any full and accurate representation of all that they imply. See the note above on p. 43 of the P&acirc;li, and <I>G</I>&acirc;taka, vol. i, p. 303.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_678"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_687">279:3</A> Not traced as yet. Mr. Trenckner prints the passage as <A NAME="page_280"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 280</FONT></A> prose, but it is clearly two verses with a slight corruption in the first line. The point of the verses lies in the untranslateable pun of the words upadh&acirc;na, 'pillow,' and padh&acirc;na, 'strenuous fight.' The word etarahi seems to me suspect, and some such reading as ka<I>l</I>i<U>n</U>garopadh&acirc;n&acirc; va would restore the metre, and at the same time bring the play on the words more into prominence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_679"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_688">280:1</A> This verse is found in the Thera G&acirc;th&acirc;, No. 985. H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; takes the na in the first line as a negative to abhivassati, and translates, 'So long as it does not rain knee-deep on him, when sitting in meditation, what cares the Bhikshu, who is bent on attaining Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, for ease!'--and this is, I think, preferable to Mr. Trenckner's division of the words.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_680"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_689">280:2</A> That is, 'filtered;' perah&acirc; nag&acirc; tab&acirc;, says the Si<I>m</I>halese, p. 541.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_681"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_690">280:3</A> Sar&icirc;ra<I>m</I> pa<I>t</I>i<I>g</I>aggitv&acirc;, 'rested a little to remove the weariness of his body,' says the Si<I>m</I>halese here, but adds below, &#167; 4, siwuru h&#156;nda.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_682"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_691">282:1</A> Not traced as yet. The verse is a riddle based on two parables. Of these the first is already published in the Samyutta Nik&acirc;ya XII, 63, 5-8. It tells of a father and mother who in the desert (and of course only with the object of keeping themselves alive) ate their only child. The other is not yet published, but Mr. Trenckner points out that it occurs in the 34th Samyutta. Oiling wheels is done solely to keep the cart going. Compare the dying Buddha's comparison of himself to a worn-out cart, which can only with difficulty be made to move along. Like that, the body of the Tath&acirc;gata can only with difficulty be kept a little longer going ('Buddhist Suttas,' p. 37).</P>
<P>As to the last word, I take it, with H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;, p. 542, to be mu<I>kkh</I>ito, and not amu<I>kkh</I>ito as is printed in the text. That is also the reading adopted by Fausb&ouml;ll at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka II, 294, where the verses are quoted.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_683"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_692">282:2</A> Na nimitta<I>m</I> gahetabba<I>m</I> n&acirc;nubya<I>&ntilde;g</I>ana<I>m</I> gahetabba<I>m</I>. On these common expressions compare A<U>n</U>guttara I, 2, 6, &amp;c.; Puggala Pa<I>&ntilde;&ntilde;</I>atti II, 17, IV, 24, &amp;c.; D&icirc;gha II, 64, &amp;c.; and Buddhaghosa as quoted in 'Vinaya Texts,' II, 9. H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; only repeats the first, but explains the second by n&#156;wata&nbsp;n&#156;wata wimas&icirc;me<I>m</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_684"></A><A HREF="sbe3609.htm#fr_693">283:1</A> From Thera G&acirc;th&acirc;. The Si<I>m</I>halese supports Mr. Trenckner in reading <I>g</I>ivh&acirc;v' in line three, but on the other hand has (twice) mana-s&acirc;yika<I>m</I> for mata-s&acirc;yika<I>m</I>. For the last line, of which a literal translation is impossible, it says, 'Let him make his couch on, fix his attention on, that Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a which is mana-s&acirc;yika-<I>k</I>itta.' I think mata is the right reading, and that very possibly a riddle or pun is intended on the two meanings of that word.</P>
