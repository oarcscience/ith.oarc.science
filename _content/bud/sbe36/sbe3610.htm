<P>[<B>375</B>] 'Just, O king, as the lotus, though it is born in the water, and grows up in the water, yet remains undefiled by the water (for no water adheres to it); just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, remain undefiled by the support that he receives, or by the following of disciples that he obtains, or by fame, or by honour, or by veneration, or by the abundance of the requisites that he enjoys. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the lotus that he ought to have.</P>
<P>3. 'And again, O king, as the lotus remains lifted up far above the water; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, remain far above all worldly things. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the lotus that he ought to have.</P>
<P>4. 'And again, O king, as the lotus trembles when blown upon by the slightest breeze; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, exercise self-control in respect of the least of the evil dispositions, perceiving the danger (in the least offence).

<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>5. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, those two qualities of seed which you say he ought to have, which are they?'</P>
<P>'Just, O king, as seed, tiny though it be, yet if sown in good soil, and if the god rains aright, will give abundant fruit; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, so conduct himself aright that the righteousness of his life may give abundantly of the fruits of Samanaship. This, O king, is the first quality of seed which he ought to have.</P>
<P>6. 'And again, O king, as seed planted in well-weeded soil comes quickly to maturity; just so, O king, will his mind, when well-mastered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_727"></A><A HREF="#fn_718"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and well-purified in solitude, if it be cast by the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, into the excellent field of self-possession, come quickly to maturity. This, O king, is the second quality of seed which he ought to have. [<B>376</B>] For it was said, O king, by Anuruddha, the Elder:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"If seed be sown on a well-weeded field,<BR>
Its fruit, abounding, will rejoice the sower.<BR>
So the recluse's heart, in solitude made pure,<BR>

<P>'Just, O king, as the Sal-tree grows within the ground to the depth of a hundred cubits or more; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, perfect in solitude the four Fruits of Samanaship, the four Discriminations, the six forms of transcendental Insight, and all the qualities befitting a recluse. This, O king, is the one quality of the Sal-tree he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by R&acirc;hula, the Elder:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"The tree that's called the Sal-tree grows above the earth,<BR>
And shoots beneath, a hundred cubits deep.<BR>
As in the fullness of time, and at its highest growth<BR>
That tree shoots in one day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_729"></A><A HREF="#fn_720"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a hundred cubits high,<BR>

<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>8. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, those three qualities of the ship that you say he ought to take, which are they?'</P>
<P>'Just, O king, as a ship, by the combination of the quantity of the different kinds of timber of which it is composed, conveys many folk across; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, cross the whole world of existence, whether in heaven, or on earth, by the combination of a number of qualities arising out of good conduct, righteousness, virtue, and the performance of duty.</P>

This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the ship he ought to have.</P>
<P>10. 'And again, O king, as the ship journeys over the great ocean, immeasurable and infinite though it be, without a further shore, unshaken in its depths, roaring with a mighty noise, and filled with crowds of fish and monsters and dragons of all sorts; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, make his mind journey through to penetration into the four Truths in their triple order, in their twelvefold form&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_730"></A><A HREF="#fn_721"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>11. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, those two qualities of the anchor which you say he ought to take, which are they?'</P>
<P>'Just, O king, as the anchor, even in the mighty sea, in the expanse of waters agitated by the crowding of ever-varying waves, will fasten the ship, and keep it still, not letting the sea take it in one direction or another; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep his mind stedfast in the mighty struggle of thoughts, in the waters of the waves of lust and malice and dullness, not letting them divert it in one direction or another. This, O king, is the first quality of the anchor he ought to have.</P>
<P>12. 'And again, O king, as the anchor floats not, but sinks down, and even in water a hundred cubits deep holds the ship fast, brings it to rest; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when he receives support, and fame, and honour, and veneration, and reverence, and offerings, and praise, [<B>378</B>] be not lifted up on the summit of the support or the fame, but keep his mind fixed on the idea of merely keeping his body alive. This, O king, is the second quality of the anchor he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by S&acirc;riputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</P><DIR>

<P><A NAME="fn_735"></A><A HREF="sbe3610.htm#fr_744">303:3</A> Sil&acirc;. Mr. Trenckner prints the passage as if sa<U>n</U>khasil&acirc; were to be taken together. But the use of the nominatives sa<U>n</U>kho sil&acirc; in the corresponding list at <I>K</I>ullavagga IX, 1, 3, 4 shows that by sil&acirc;, 'rock,' some kind of gem. is meant. And that our author does not intend to deviate from the earlier authority is clear from his own work (above, p. 267 of the P&acirc;li), where he also gives the two nominatives in a similar, though longer, list of gems. What may be the particular gem referred to under the name 'rock' is doubtful. H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;, p. 561, merely repeats the word sil&acirc;; and Clough, besides 'rock,' gives as special meaning only 'arsenic.' At <I>K</I>ullavagga ('Vinaya Texts,' III, 304) I have rendered it 'rock,' but 'quartz' now seems to me preferable.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_736"></A><A HREF="sbe3610.htm#fr_745">304:1</A> It is very characteristic of our author that his interpretation of the gems into ethical conceptions is quite different from that of the <I>K</I>ullavagga, and much more mystic. In the older passage they are translated into the seven constituent characteristics of Arahatship. (See 'Vinaya Texts,' loc. cit., p. 305.) Compare also Divy&acirc;vad&acirc;na, pp. 115, 229.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_738"></A><A HREF="sbe3610.htm#fr_747">305:1</A> Dev&acirc;tidevena. It is not known when this epithet, which our author so constantly applies to the Buddha, first came into use. It is not found in the Pi<I>t</I>akas, and the Milinda is the oldest book in which it has been traced. It is given in the Mah&acirc;vyutpatti, page 1, as a recognised epithet, but not in the corresponding P&acirc;li list of epithets in the Abhidh&acirc;na Pad&icirc;pik&acirc; (though deva-deva occurs there). The origin of the appellation is solemnly explained in the Divy&acirc;vad&acirc;na, p. 391. It is there said to have been first bestowed on the Buddha (when, as a child, he was presented in the temple), because all the gods bowed down before him. There is nothing about this in the corresponding passage of the Lalita Vistara, pp. 136-138. The epithet is used of the Buddha in an inscription of Toram&acirc;na Sh&acirc;hi ('Epigraphia Indica' for October, 1889). It occurs also in a verse preserved in the commentaries on the Dhammapada and the <I>G</I>&acirc;taka (<I>G</I>&acirc;taka IV, 158 = Dhammapada 148)--a verse not found in the Pi<I>t</I>aka versions of the same episode--and is used in a kind of pun in the Mah&acirc;vamsa, chap. i, verse 56. But these three passages are all of the fifth century A.D.</P>
