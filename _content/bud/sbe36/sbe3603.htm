<P>Now, venerable N&acirc;gasena, if the former of these two passages was really spoken by the Tath&acirc;gata, then the second must be wrong.

<P>3. 'But when the Blessed One said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Have pleasant dwelling-places built,<BR>
And lodge there learned men,"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>that was said with respect to two matters only. And what are those two? The gift of a dwelling-place (Wih&acirc;ra) has been praised and approved, esteemed and highly spoken of, by all the Buddhas. And those who have made such a gift shall be delivered from rebirth, old age, and death. This is the first of the advantages in the gift of a dwelling-place. And again, if there be a common dwelling place (a Wih&acirc;ra) the sisters of the Order will have a clearly ascertained place of rendezvous, and those who wish to visit (the brethren of the Order)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> will find it an easy matter to do so. Whereas if there were no homes for the members of the Order it would be difficult to visit them. This is the second of the advantages in the gift of a dwelling-place (a Wih&acirc;ra). It was with reference to these two matters only that it was said by the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Have pleasant dwelling-places built,<BR>

<P>[<B>213</B>] 'And it does not follow from that that the sons of the Buddha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> should harbour longings after the household life.'</P>

He who has no self-control as regards the stomach, O king, will destroy living creatures, will take possession of what has not been given to him, will be unchaste, will speak lies, will drink strong drink, will put his mother or his father to death, will slay an Arahat, will create a schism in the Order, will even with malice aforethought wound a Tath&acirc;gata.

BAKKULA'S SUPERIORITY TO THE BUDDHA.]</P>
<P>8. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, it was said by the Blessed One:</P>
<P>"A Brahman am I, O brethren, devoted to self-sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, pure-handed at every time; this body that I bear with me is my last, I am the supreme Healer and Physician&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>."</P>

<P>'Now it is well known that diseases arose several times in the body of the Blessed One. So that if, N&acirc;gasena, the Tath&acirc;gata was supreme, then the statement he made about Bakkula's bodily health must be wrong.

<P>9. 'Both the quotations you have made, O king, are correct&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But what the Blessed One said about Bakkula was said of those disciples who had learnt by heart the sacred words, and studied them, and handed down the tradition, which in reference to the characteristics (each of them in some one point) had in addition to those which were found in him himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. [<B>216</B>] For there were certain of the disciples of the Blessed One, O king, who were "meditators on foot," spending a whole day and night in walking up and down in meditation. But the Blessed One was in the habit of spending the day and night in meditation, not only walking up and down but also sitting and lying down. So such, O king, of the disciples as were "meditators on foot&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>" surpassed him in that particular. And there were certain of the disciples of the Blessed One, O king, who were "eaters at one sitting," who would not, even to save their lives, take more than one meal a day. But the</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Blessed One was in the habit of taking a second, or even a third. So such, O king, of the disciples as were "eaters at one sitting" surpassed him in that particular. And in a similar way, O king, a number of different things have been told, each one of one or other of the disciples. But the Blessed One, O king, surpassed them all in respect of uprightness, and of power of meditation, and of wisdom, and of emancipation, and of that insight which arises out of the knowledge of emancipation, and in all that lies within the scope of a Buddha. It was with reference to that, O king, that he said:</P>
<P>"A Brahman am I, O brethren, devoted to self-sacrifice, pure-handed at every time; this body that I bear with me is my last, I am the supreme Healer and Physician."</P>
<P>10. 'Now one man, O king, may be of good birth, and another may be wealthy, and another full of wisdom, and another well educated, and another brave, and another adroit; but a king, surpassing all these, is reckoned supreme. just in that way, O king, is the Blessed One the highest, the most worthy of respect, the best of all beings. And in so far as the venerable Bakkula was healthy in body, that was by reason of an aspiration (he had formed in a previous birth)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. For, O king, when Anoma-dass&icirc;, the Blessed One, was afflicted with a disease, with wind in his stomach, and again when Vipass&icirc;, the Blessed One, and sixty-eight thousand of his disciples, were afflicted with a disease, with greenness of blood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A></P>
<P>being at those times an ascetic, had cured that disease with various medicines, and attained (thereby) to such healthiness of body (in this life) that it was said of him:</P>
<P>"The chief, O brethren, among those who are disciples of mine, in the matter of bodily health, is Bakkula."</P>
<P>11. 'But the Blessed One, O king, whether he be suffering, or not suffering from disease; whether he have taken, or not taken, upon himself the observance</P>
<P><A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A></P>
<P>of special vows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,--there is no being like unto the Blessed One. [<B>217</B>] For this, O king, has been said by the Blessed One, the god of gods, in the most excellent Sa<I>m</I>yutta Nik&acirc;ya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:</P>
<P>"Whatsoever beings, O brethren, there may be whether without feet, or bipeds, or four-footed things, whether with a body, or without a body, whether conscious or unconscious, or neither conscious nor not--the Tath&acirc;gata is acknowledged to be the chief of all, the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme."'</P>

<P>'If, N&acirc;gasena, the Tath&acirc;gata be the discoverer of a way not previously found out, then it must be wrong that it was an ancient way that he perceived, an ancient path along which previous Buddhas walked. But if the way he perceived were an ancient way, then the statement that it was unknown must be wrong. This too is a double-edged problem, now put to you, which you have to solve.'</P>
<P>13. 'Both the quotations you make, O king, are accurate. And both the statements so made are correct. When the previous Tath&acirc;gatas, O king, had disappeared, then, there being no teacher left, their way too disappeared.

<P>"Now I perceived, O brethren, the ancient way, the ancient path along which previous Buddhas walked."</P>
<P>'And it was a way which--there being, through the disappearance of previous Tath&acirc;gatas, no teacher left--was a way then broken up, crumbled away, gone to ruin, closed in, and lost to view, that the Tath&acirc;gata made now passable again. And therefore is it that he said:</P>
<P>"The Tath&acirc;gata, O brethren, the Arahat, the Buddha supreme, is the discoverer of a way that was unknown."</P>
<P>14. 'Suppose, O king, that on the disappearance of a sovran overlord, the mystic Gem of Sovranty lay concealed in a cleft on the mountain peak, and that on another sovran overlord arriving at his supreme dignity, it should appear to him.

And therefore is it that he said:</P>
<P>"The Tath&acirc;gata, O brethren, the Arahat, the Buddha supreme, is the discoverer of a way that was unknown."</P>
<P>15. 'It is, O king, as when a mother brings forth from her womb the child that is already there, and the saying is that the mother has given birth to the child.

<P>'Now, N&acirc;gasena, if it is true what the Buddha said, that, in his former births as a man, he inflicted no hurt on living beings, then the saying that, as Lomasa Kassapa, he had hundreds of living creatures slain must be false. But if he had, then the saying that he inflicted no hurt on living beings must be false. This too is a double-edged problem, now put to you, which you have to solve.'</P>
<P>17. 'The Blessed One did say, O king, that already in former births, when he was a man, he had acquired the habit of inflicting no hurt on living beings. And Lomasa Kassapa, the Rishi, did have hundreds of living creatures slain, and offered the great sacrifice, the "Drink of Triumph." [<B>220</B>] But that was done when he was out of his mind through lust, and not when he was conscious of what he was doing.'</P>
<P>'There are these eight classes of men, N&acirc;gasena, who kill living beings--the lustful man through his lust, and the cruel man through his anger, and the dull man through his stupidity, and the proud man through his pride, and the avaricious man through his greed, and the needy man for the sake of a livelihood, and the fool in joke, and the king in the way of punishment. These, N&acirc;gasena, are the eight classes of men who, kill living beings. The Bodisat, venerable N&acirc;gasena, must have been acting in accordance with his natural disposition when he did so.'</P>
<P>'No, it was not, O king, an act natural to him that the Bodisat did then. If the Bodisat had been led, by natural inclination, to offer the great sacrifice, he would not have uttered the verse:</P>

<P>'What punishment is due to a madman? We should order him to be beaten and set free. That is all the punishment he would have.'</P>
<P>'So then, O king, there is no punishment according to the offence of a madman. It follows that there is no sin in the act done by a madman, it is a pardonable act.

It was when thus out of his mind, confused and agitated, that he, with his thoughts all perplexed, scattered and wandering, thus offered the great sacrifice, the "Drink of Triumph,"--and mighty was the outpour of blood from the necks of the slaughtered beasts!

This too is a double-edged problem, now put to you, which you have to solve.'</P>

And Kassapa the Blessed One, the Arahat, the Buddha supreme, was abused and reviled by Gotip&acirc;la the young Brahman with vile and bitter words, with the epithets of shaveling and good-for-nothing monk. But that was owing to his birth and family surroundings. For <I>G</I>otip&acirc;la, O king, was descended from a family of unbelievers, men void of faith. His mother and father, his sisters and brothers, the bondswomen and bondsmen, the hired servants and dependents in the house, were worshippers of Brahm&acirc;, reverers of Brahm&acirc;; and harbouring the idea that Brahmans were the highest and most honourable among men, they reviled and loathed those others who had renounced the world.

<P>'And that the rain fell upon the Tath&acirc;gata's hut happened out of consideration for the great masses of the people.

<P>'Because all evil qualities, not productive of merit, are in the Tath&acirc;gata suppressed, abandoned, put away, dispelled, rooted out, destroyed, come to an end, gone out, and ceased, therefore is it that the Tath&acirc;gata is called a Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

A Brahman, O king, means one who carries on the line of the tradition of the ancient instructions concerning the learning and the teaching of sacred writ, concerning the acceptance of gifts, concerning subjugation of the senses, self-control in conduct, and performance of duty. And it is because the Tath&acirc;gata carries on the line of the tradition of the ancient rules enjoined by the Conquerors&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> regarding all these things, that therefore also is he called a Brahman. [<B>226</B>] A Brahman, O king, means one who enjoys the supreme bliss of the ecstatic meditation. And it is because the Tath&acirc;gata does this, that therefore also is he called a Brahman. A Brahman, O king, means one who knows the course and revolution of births in all forms of existence. And it is because the Tath&acirc;gata knows this, that therefore also is he called a Brahman. The appellation "Brahman," O king, was not given to the Blessed One by his mother, nor his father, not by his brother, nor his sister, not by his friends, nor his relations, not by spiritual teachers of any sort, no, not by the gods. It is by reason of their emancipation that this is the name of the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones.

<P>with its hundreds of ribs fashioned out of the highest wisdom, with its handle firm and strong through long suffering,--the symbol of his mighty fame and glory. That too is the reason why the Tath&acirc;gata is called a king. A king is one who is held worthy of homage by the multitudes who approach him, who come into his presence. And the Blessed One, O king, is held worthy of homage by multitudes of beings, whether gods or men, who approach him, who come into his presence. That too is the reason why the Tath&acirc;gata is called a king. A king is one who, when pleased with a strenuous servant, gladdens his heart by bestowing upon him, at his own good pleasure, any costly gift the officer may choose&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

That too is the reason why the Tath&acirc;gata is called a king.

And so, O king, the man who, in shamelessness or discontent, transgresses the command of the Blessed One, as laid down in the rules of his Order, that man, despised, disgraced and censured, is expelled from the religion of the Conqueror. That too is the reason why the Tath&acirc;gata is called a king. A king is one who in his turn proclaiming laws and regulations according to the instructions laid down in succession by the righteous kings of ancient times, and thus carrying on his rule in righteousness, becomes beloved and dear to the people, desired in the world, and by the force of his righteousness establishes his dynasty long in the land. And the Blessed One, O king, proclaiming in his turn laws and regulations according to the instructions laid down in succession by the Buddhas of ancient times, and thus in righteousness being teacher of the world,--he too is beloved and dear to both gods and men, desired by them, and by the force of his righteousness he makes his religion last long in the land. That too is the reason why the Tath&acirc;gata is called a king.</P>
<P>'Thus, O king, so many are the reasons why the Tath&acirc;gata should be both Brahman and also king, that the ablest of the brethren could scarcely in an &aelig;on enumerate them all. Why then should I dilate any further? Accept what I have said only in brief.'</P>

<P>into the foreground. But if he did rightly in so emphasizing the giving of gifts, then it is not true that he accepted no gifts earned by the utterance of sacred words. And why so? Because if any one worthy of offerings should praise to the laity the good results to them of the bestowal of alms, they, hearing that discourse, and pleased with it, will proceed to give alms again and again. And then, whosoever enjoy that gift, they are really enjoying that which has been earned by the utterance of sacred words. This too is a double-edged problem, now put to you, which you have to solve.'</P>

But this is the custom of all the Tath&acirc;gatas--first by discourse on almsgiving to make the hearts of hearers inclined towards it, and then afterwards to urge them to righteousness. This is as when men, O king, give first of all to young children things to play with--[<B>229</B>] such as toy ploughs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, tip-cat sticks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, toy wind-mills&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, measures made of leaves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, toy carts,</P>

Or it is as when a physician first causes his patients to drink oil for four or five days in order to strengthen them, and to soften their bodies; and then afterwards administers a purge. The supporters of the faith, O king, the lordly givers, have their hearts thus softened, made tender, affected. Thereby do they cross over to the further shore of the ocean of transmigration by the aid of the boat of their gifts, by the support of the causeway of their gifts.

And again, O king, suppose any member of the Order, in going his round for alms, should stand where there is no room, and stretch out his neck like a peacock on the gaze, in the hope: "Thus will the folk see me"--that too is a bodily intimation which is wrong. True brethren will not accept an alms so asked for, and he who thus acts is regarded like the last. And again, O king, suppose any member of the Order should make a sign with his jaw, or with his eyebrow, or with his finger--[<B>230</B>] that too is a bodily intimation which is wrong.

In case, O king, a brother intimate his wish for a number of things, requisites of a member of the Order--robes and bowls and bedding and medicine for the sick--that is a verbal intimation which is wrong. Things so asked for the true members of the Order (Ariy&acirc;) will not accept; and in the religion of the Noble Ones the individual who acts thus is despised, looked down upon, not respected, held blameworthy, disregarded, not well thought of--reckoned rather as one who has broken his (vows as to) means of livelihood. And again, O king, in case a brother should, in the hearing of others, speak thus: "I am in want of such and such a thing;" and in consequence of that saying being heard by the others he should then get that thing--that too is a verbal intimation which is wrong. True members of the Order will not use a thing so obtained, and he who acts thus is regarded like the last.

<P>'So that, N&acirc;gasena, just as if an archer, or an archer's pupil, who had practised archery for many days with the object of fighting, should, when the day of the great battle had come, draw back--just so did the Tath&acirc;gata, who through countless ages had gradually matured his omniscience for the sake of bringing safe to the shore (of salvation) the great masses of the people, turn back, on the day when that omniscience had been reached, from proclaiming the Truth. just as if a wrestler who through many days had practised wrestling should, when the day of the wrestling match&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> had come, draw back--just so did the Tath&acirc;gata, who through countless ages had gradually matured his omniscience for the sake of bringing safe to the shore (of salvation) the great masses of the people, turn back, on the day when that omniscience had been reached, from proclaiming the Truth.</P>

And therefore, at the thought: "When so powerful and glorious, so famous and renowned, so high and mighty a one has shown himself inclined (to the Dhamma), then will the whole world of gods and men become inclined to it, hold it fitting, have faith in it"--on this ground, O king, the Tath&acirc;gatas preached the Dhamma when requested to do so by Brahm&acirc;.

<P><A NAME="fn_30"></A><A HREF="sbe3603.htm#fr_30">1:1</A> This is the opening verse of the Muni Sutta (in the Sutta Nip&acirc;ta I, 12). It is quoted again below, p. 385 of the P&acirc;li text. The second line is, in the original, enigmatically terse, and runs simply, 'From a home dust arises.' This Fausb&ouml;ll renders (in the S. B. E., vol. x, part ii, p. 33), 'From household life arises defilement,' the word for dust (ra<I>g</I>o) being often used figuratively in the sense of something that disfigures, is out of place in the higher life. It is the distracting effect of household cares that the recluse has to fear.</P>

The first half of it occurs in a different connection at Dhammapada, verse 168, which I have rendered (at 'Buddhism,' p. 65), 'Rise up and loiter not!' without any reference at all to food. This was in accordance with the view taken of the passage, both by Prof. Fausb&ouml;ll, who renders it (p. 31 of his edition of the P&acirc;li), 'Surgat, ne sit socors,' and by Prof. Max M&uuml;ller, who renders it (S. B. E, vol. x, part i, p. 47), 'Rouse thyself, do not be idle!' And I still think (especially noting such passages as Dhammapada, verses 231, 232, and the verse quoted in the Commentary, p. 126 of Fausb&ouml;ll, from <I>G</I>&acirc;taka IV, 496, &amp;c.) that this was the original meaning in that connection. But here the words must clearly be taken as referring to food, and it is very remarkable that the commentator on the Dhammapada (see p. 335 of Fausb&ouml;ll's edition) takes them in that sense also even in the other connection. It is a striking instance of the way in which commentators impart a purely technical sense into a general ethical precept.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_45"></A><A HREF="sbe3603.htm#fr_45">7:2</A> This is much more than a mere injunction not to gild refined gold. It comes very near to the enunciation of the dangerous doctrine that the holy man is above the law, and that nothing he does can be wrong. It is curious how frequently one finds this proposition cropping up in the most unexpected places, and the history of religious belief is full of instances of its pernicious effect on the most promising movements. When one considers the great influence of our author's work, it becomes especially interesting to note how the doctrine has never, among the orthodox Buddhists, who read the P&acirc;li Scriptures, been extended from the Buddha himself to his followers, and from moderation in food to matters of more vital import in the life of a church. And this is the more remarkable as the Tantra works of the corrupt Buddhism of Nepal and Tibet show how fatal has been the result of the doctrine among those Buddhists who had lost the guiding support of the older Scriptures.</P>

He translates agam&acirc;na<I>m</I> and the two following words, as relative compounds, by agama-dh&acirc;ri-w&ucirc;, &amp;c., and in this I have followed him. But he supplies an 'and' after the last, thus taking them as accusatives in dependence on sandh&acirc;ya, and that cannot be right.

But pupphaka at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka III, 541, means blood, and the disease may <A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A> be so called because the blood was turned by it to the colour of grass (ti<I>n</I>a). H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; (who gives these legends of the previous births of Bakkula at much greater length, adding others from the time of the Buddhas Padumuttara and Kassapa, and giving the story also of his present birth) says that the disease arose from contact with wind which had been poisoned through blowing over a Upas tree (p. 296 of the Si<I>m</I>halese version). But he does not explain the name of the disease, which occurs only here.</P>
<P>In his present birth Bakkula is said to have been born at Kos&acirc;mb&icirc;, in a wealthy family. His mother, understanding that to bathe a new-born child in the Jumna would ensure him a long life, took him down to the river. Whilst he was there being bathed, a huge fish swallowed him. But the fish, caught at Benares, was sold to a wealthy but childless man there, and on being cut open, the babe was found in it unhurt.</P>
<P>The mother hearing the news of this marvel, went in great state and with haste to Benares and claimed the child. Thereupon an interesting lawsuit arose, and the king of Benares, thinking it unjust to deprive the purchaser of a fish of anything inside it, and also unjust to deprive a mother of her child, decided that the child belonged equally to both. So he became the heir of both families, and was therefore called Bak-kula, 'the two-family-one' (Bak = Ba = Dv&acirc;). On the real derivation of Bakkula, see Dr. Morris in the 'Journal of the P&acirc;li Text Society,' 1886, pp. 94-99. We need not quarrel with a false etymology which shows us so clearly the origin of the legend. Then Bakkula enjoys great prosperity in the orthodox three palaces, and at eighty years of age, being still in vigorous health, enters the Order.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_56"></A><A HREF="sbe3603.htm#fr_56">12:3</A> This piece of casuistry is not so entirely at variance with the context of the second passage (quoted from the A<U>n</U>guttara I, 14) as would seem at first sight. The answer practically amounts to this, that though each of many disciples may be superior to the Buddha in certain bodily qualities, or even in the special vows known as Dhutangas, yet he surpasses them in the 'weightier matters of the law.' It is true that one of the instances given, that of the <I>th</I>&acirc;na-ka<U>n</U>kamik&acirc;, is not included in the list of Dhutangas, and in the long enumeration in the A<U>n</U>guttara of those of the disciples who were 'chief' in any way, 'weightier matters of the law' are not overlooked. But 'meditation on foot' is of the same nature as the acknowledged Dhutangas, and none of the five special points in which N&acirc;gasena places especially the superiority of the Buddha (uprightness, &amp;c.), is mentioned in the A<U>n</U>guttara.
