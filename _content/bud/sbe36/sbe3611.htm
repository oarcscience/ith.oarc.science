<P>'Just, O king, as water is firmly fixed (in pools, wells, &amp;c.), shakes not, and (in its ordinary state) is not disturbed, and is pure by nature; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, putting away hypocrisy, and whining, and intimating their wants, and improper influences of all sorts, be fixed, unshaken, undisturbed, and pure in nature.

'And again, O king, as the sovran overlord allows no robber bands to form in his realm; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never allow lustful or angry or cruel ideas to arise within him.

<P><A NAME="fn_744"></A><A HREF="sbe3611.htm#fr_753">308:2</A> The Si<I>m</I>halese (pp. 563, 564) gives the whole story. She was the daughter of An&acirc;thapi<I>nd</I>ika (Sudatta), the famous supporter of the Buddha, and builder of the <I>G</I>etavana at S&acirc;vatthi. On her marriage to a rich merchant at S&acirc;keta (Audh) named K&acirc;laka, he invited the Brahman naked ascetics of his sect, the &Acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;vakas, and asked her to go and entertain 'the Arahats.' Hearing the word Arahat she went quickly and full of delight to do so; and was shocked beyond measure to find a number of disorderly fakirs, with neither modesty in their hearts, nor decency in their outward behaviour. So she fled from the hall, and on her husband remonstrating, was indignant. He then asked her what the recluses <A NAME="page_309"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 309</FONT></A> of her sect were like, and she told him. Another verse from her description is quoted below, p. 387 of the P&acirc;li. The above story has been often repeated.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_745"></A><A HREF="sbe3611.htm#fr_754">309:1</A> Not traced. H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; reads eka<I>&ntilde;</I> <I>k</I>e b&acirc;ha<I>m</I> (twice) and m&acirc;naso, pamodito; and he is no doubt right.</P>

Professor Fausb&ouml;ll reads ma<I>m</I> kate, but the Si<I>m</I>halese (pp. 566, 567) confirms Mr. Trenckner's reading, ma<I>m</I> k&acirc;na, ma<I>m</I> niss&acirc;ya, ma<I>m</I> anattha-k&acirc;mat&acirc;ya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_749"></A><A HREF="sbe3611.htm#fr_758">312:1</A> Not traced as yet exactly in these words. But the passage at Ma<I>ggh</I>ima Nik&acirc;ya I, 424, lines 3-6, agrees with it throughout, except that for akusal&acirc; dhamm&acirc; here we have there manap&acirc;-man&acirc;pa phass&acirc;, which comes to much the same thing. As the words are there addressed to R&acirc;hula, and as our passage here is introduced with the same formula as the quotation below (p. 388 of the P&acirc;li) which is certainly taken from the same page of the Ma<I>ggh</I>ima, I think the above (M. I, 424, lines 3-6) is most probably the passage our author now intended to quote. If so, we have here a real case of difference in reading.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_757"></A><A HREF="sbe3611.htm#fr_766">318:1</A> &Acirc;gam&acirc;dhigame. These are two, not one. &Acirc;gama adhigama dekhi da says the Si<I>m</I>halese, p. 573.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_758"></A><A HREF="sbe3611.htm#fr_767">318:2</A> U<I>l</I>&acirc;r&acirc;dhipati. Dr. Morris in the 'Journal of the P&acirc;li Text Society' (1880, p. 107) ingeniously proposes to read u<I>l</I>ur&acirc;g&acirc;dhipati, 'king and lord over the u<I>l</I>u's, the lunar mansions! In that case the u<I>l</I>&acirc;ra in the latter clause of the sentence would be a play upon words. But Mr. Trenckner's reading is confirmed by the Si<I>m</I>halese, which has <I>k</I>andra diwya-r&acirc;<I>g</I>a tema mahatw&ucirc; sisira-gu<I>n</I>aye<I>m</I> adhipati w&ucirc;yeya, 'the moon, that heavenly king, is a lord by reason of his great coldness.' And the reading may well stand, for the mention, in the latter part of the clause, of the thing over which the Bhikshu is to be lord does not necessarily require a corresponding word in the first part. We have numerous instances in these similes of the ethical interpretation of the physical simile being an addition, with nothing corresponding to it in the type discussed. The moon was a god, lord over other things besides the lunar mansions.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_319"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 319</FONT></A></P>
<P>This, O king, is the second quality of the moon he ought to have.</P>
<P>33. 'And again, O king, as the moon wanders at night; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be given to solitude. [<B>389</B>] This, O king, is the third quality of the moon he ought to have.</P>
<P>34.

This, O king, is the fourth quality of the moon he ought to have.</P>
<P>35. 'And again, O king, as the moon rises when begged and prayed to do so; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, frequent for alms those families who have asked and invited him to do so&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_769"></A><A HREF="#fn_760"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. This, O king, is the fifth quality of the moon he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Samyutta, Nik&acirc;ya:</P>
<P>"Like the moon, O brethren, let your visits be paid to the laity. Drawing back alike in outward demeanour and in inward spirit, be ye always, as strangers on their first visit, retiring in the presence of the laity. [As the man who looks down a deep</P>

'Has his mansion, forty-nine yo<I>g</I>anas in extent, as his banner,' says H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;. (A yo<I>g</I>ana is seven miles.) Vim&acirc;na does not mean lunar mansion, but the palace which every deity, and therefore also the moon, is supposed to inhabit.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_760"></A><A HREF="sbe3611.htm#fr_769">319:2</A> The Si<I>m</I>halese, p. 573, has the exact opposite. 'As the moon rises whether begged to do so or not, so should the Bhikshu visit the laity whether invited to do so or not.' But the P&acirc;li must be right, as the subsequent quotation shows.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_761"></A><A HREF="sbe3611.htm#fr_770">320:1</A> Samyutta, XVI, 3, 2, 3. The sentence in brackets is added from H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;, who gives here, p. 274, the P&acirc;li text. Apakassa, the gerund of ava-karsh, and naviy&acirc;, 'new-comers,' are only found in this passage. In three cases M. L&eacute;on Feer has here gone wrong, as he has so often elsewhere done, by putting the readings of the Si<I>m</I>halese MSS. only in the notes, and adopting the Burmese readings in the text. He should have read, as H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; does, ni<I>kk</I>am naviy&acirc; . . . . . . gambh&icirc;r&ucirc;dap&acirc;na<I>m</I>, . . . . . . nad&icirc;-dugga<I>m</I>.</P>

Vitakka, which, in accord with the context and with H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;, is rendered above 'evil thoughts,' and by Professor Max M&uuml;ller 'doubts,' really means simply 'thoughts,' and is sometimes used without any bad connotation. In the P&acirc;li the word M&acirc;ru, which spoils the metre, may possibly be an ancient gloss introduced by mistake into the text.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_766"></A><A HREF="sbe3611.htm#fr_775">324:3</A> Mr. Trenckner points out that this passage is taken from the A<U>n</U>guttara X, 5, 8. H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;, who gives the P&acirc;li, prints it as verse, and translates the context at some length.</P>
