# BOOK V.

### THE PROBLEM OF INFERENCE.

\[**329**\] 1. Now Milinda the king went up to the place where Nâgasena
was, and bowed down before him, and took his seat on one side. And when
so seated he, longing to know, to hear, and to remember, and longing to
make the light of knowledge arise and to break in pieces his ignorance,
roused up in himself courage and zeal, and, full of self-possession and
thoughtfulness, spake thus to Nâgasena:

2\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, tell me, have you ever seen the Buddha <span
id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_486)?'

'No, O king.'

'Then have your teachers ever seen the Buddha?'

'No, Sire.'

'So you say, venerable Nâgasena, that you have never seen the Buddha,
and that your teachers have never seen the Buddha. Therefore, Nâgasena,
the Buddha did not exist. There is no clear evidence, in that case, of a
Buddha.'

'But did those Kshatriyas of old exist, who were the founders of the
line of kings from which you come?'

'Certainly, Sir. How can there be any doubt about that?'

'Well, O king. Have you ever seen them?'

'No, Sir.'

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

'And those who instructed you--the family chaplains, and officers of the
staff, and those who lay down the law, and ministers of state--have they
ever seen those Kshatriyas of old?'

'No, Sir.'

'If then neither have you seen them, nor your teachers, where are they?
There is no clear evidence, in that case, of those Kshatriyas of old!'

3\. 'But, Nâgasena, the royal insignia they used are still to be
seen--\[**330**\] the white sunshade of state, and the crown, and the
slippers, and the fan with the yak's tail, and the sword of state, and
the priceless throne--and by these can we know and believe that the
Kshatriyas of old lived once.'

'Just so, O king, can we know that Blessed One and believe in him. For
there is a reason for our knowledge and belief that the Blessed One was.
And what is that reason?--The royal insignia used by that Blessed One,
by him of knowledge and insight, the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme, are
still to be seen-the four Means of keeping oneself ready and mindful,
and the fourfold Great Struggle, and the four steps to Iddhi, and the
five Organs of the moral sense, and the five moral Powers, and the seven
forms of the wisdom of the Arahats, and the Noble Eightfold Path <span
id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_487)--and by these can the whole

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

world of gods and men know and believe that that Blessed One existed
once. By this reason, on this ground, by this argument, through this
inference, can it be known that the Blessed One lived.

He who, himself set free in that bless'd state  
In which the Upadhis have ceased to be,  
--Lusts, sin, and Karma,--has brought safe ashore,  
Saved from the sea of woe, great multitudes--  
Only by inference can it be known  
That he, the best of men, existed once <span
id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_488)."'

4\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, give me an illustration.'

'Just, O king, as the architect of a City <span
id="fr_492"></span>[2](#fn_489), when he wants to build one, would first
search out a pleasant spot of ground, with which no fault can be found,
even, with no hills or gullies in it, free from rough ground and rocks,
not open to the danger of attack. And then, when he has made plain any
rough places there may still be on it, he would clear it thoroughly of
all stumps and stakes, and would proceed to build there a city fine and
regular, measured out into suitable quarters <span
id="fr_493"></span>[3](#fn_490), with trenches and ramparts thrown up
around it <span id="fr_494"></span>[4](#fn_491), with strong gateways,
watch-towers, and battlements, with wide squares and open places and
junctions (where two roads meet) and cross-ways (where four

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

roads meet) <span id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_492), with cleanly and even
high roads <span id="fr_496"></span>[2](#fn_493), with regular lines of
open shops (bazaars), well provided with parks, and gardens, and lakes,
and lotus-ponds, and wells, adorned with many kinds of temples to the
gods, free from every fault. And then when the city stood there in all
its glory, he would go away to some other land. And in course of time
that city might become mighty and prosperous, filled with stores of
food, \[**331**\] peaceful, glorious, happy, free from distress and
calamity, the meeting-place of all sorts and conditions of men. Then
nobles and brahmans, merchants and work-people; soldiers mounted on
elephants, and on horses, and on chariots; infantry, and bowmen, and
swordsmen; standard-bearers, officers, and camp-followers <span
id="fr_497"></span>[3](#fn_494); highborn warriors whose delight is in
war, fighting champions, men mighty as elephants, heroes, men who fight
in buckskin <span id="fr_498"></span>[4](#fn_495), devoted fighting-men
born of slaves in great houses or of the privates in the royal
army <span id="fr_499"></span>[5](#fn_496); troops of professional
wrestlers <span id="fr_500"></span>[6](#fn_497);

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

cooks and curry makers, barbers and bathing attendants, smiths and
florists, workers in gold and silver and lead and tin and copper and
brass <span id="fr_501"></span>[1](#fn_498) and iron, and jewellers;
messengers; potters, salt gatherers <span
id="fr_502"></span>[2](#fn_499), tanners, carriage builders, carvers in
ivory <span id="fr_503"></span>[3](#fn_500), rope makers, comb makers,
cotton-thread spinners, basket makers, bow manufacturers, bowstring
makers, arrow fletchers, painters, dye manufacturers, dyers, weavers,
tailors, assayers of gold <span id="fr_504"></span>[4](#fn_501), cloth
merchants <span id="fr_505"></span>[5](#fn_502), dealers in perfumes,
grass cutters \` hewers of wood, hired servants <span
id="fr_506"></span>[6](#fn_503), people who live by gathering flowers
and fruits and roots in the woods, hawkers of boiled rice, sellers of
cakes, fishmongers, butchers, dealers in strong drinks, play actors,
dancers, acrobats <span id="fr_507"></span>[7](#fn_504), conjurors,
professional bards <span id="fr_508"></span>[8](#fn_505), wrestlers

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (boxers), corpse burners, casters out of rotten
flowers <span id="fr_509"></span>[1](#fn_506), savages <span
id="fr_510"></span>[2](#fn_507), wild men of the woods <span
id="fr_511"></span>[3](#fn_508), prostitutes, swingers and jumpers <span
id="fr_512"></span>[4](#fn_509), and the slave girls of bullies--people
of many countries, people from Scythia, Bactria, China, and Vilâta;
people of U*gg*eni, of Bhâruka*kkh*a, of Benares, of Kosala, and of the
border lands; people from Magadha, and Sâketa, and Sura*tth*a, and the
West; from Ko*t*umbara and Madhura, from Alexandria, Kashmîr, and
Gandhâra <span id="fr_513"></span>[5](#fn_510),--all these coming to
take up their residence there, and finding the new city to be regular,
faultless, perfect, and pleasant, would know: "Able indeed must that
architect have been by whom this city was built!"

5\. 'Just so, O king that Blessed One, peerless, unequalled,
unapproached, incomparable, admirable beyond all measure by weight or
calculation, of infinite virtue, full of virtue and perfection,
boundless in wisdom and glory and zeal and power, who, when he had
attained to the summit of all the perfections

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

of the Buddhas, \[**332**\] overthrew Mâra and all his hosts,--he,
bursting asunder the net of heresy, and casting aside ignorance, and
causing wisdom to arise, and bearing aloft the torch of Truth, reached
forward to Buddhahood itself, and so, unconquered and unconquerable in
the fight, built this city of Righteousness. And the Blessed One's City
of Righteousness, O king, has righteousness for its rampart, and fear of
sin for its moat, and knowledge for the battlement over its city gate,
and zeal for the watch-tower above that, and faith for the pillars at
its base, and mindfulness for the watchman at the gate, and wisdom for
the terrace above, and the Suttantas for its market-place, and the
Abhidhamma for its cross-ways, and the Vinaya (the Canon Law) for its
judgment hall, and constant self-possession for its chief street. And in
that street, O king, these bazaars are open--a flower bazaar, and a
fruit bazaar, and an antidote bazaar, and a medicine bazaar, and an
ambrosia bazaar, and a bazaar for precious stones, and a bazaar for all
manner of merchandise.'

6\. 'But what, venerable Nâgasena, is the flower bazaar of the Blessed
One, the Buddha?'

'There are certain subjects for meditation, O king, that have been made
known by the Blessed One, by him of knowledge and insight, by the
Arahat, the Buddha Supreme. And they are these. The idea of the
impermanence (of every thing and of every being), the idea of the
absence of any abiding principle (any soul in any thing or any being),
the idea of the impurity and the idea of the danger connected with the
body, the idea of getting rid of evil dispositions, the idea of freedom
from passion, the idea of peace, the idea of dissatisfaction with the

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

things of the world, the idea of the transitory nature of all
conditions, the idea of ecstatic trance, the ideas of a corpse in the
various stages of decay, the ideas of a place of execution in all its
various horrors, the idea of love to all beings, the idea of pity for
all beings, the idea of sympathy with all beings, the idea of equanimity
in all the changing circumstances of life, the idea of death, and the
idea of the body <span id="fr_514"></span>[1](#fn_511). These, O king,
are the subjects for meditation prescribed by the Blessed One. And of
these, whoever, longing to be delivered from old age and death, takes
any one as the subject of his meditation, by that meditation does he
become set free from passion, set free from malice, set free from
dullness, set free from pride, set free from wrong views, by that does
he cross the ocean of Sa*m*sâra, and stem the torrent of cravings, and
cleanse himself of the threefold stain <span
id="fr_515"></span>[2](#fn_512), and destroy within himself all evil;
and so, entering that glorious city, spotless and stainless, pure and
white, \[**333**\] ageless and deathless, where all is security and calm
and bliss--the city of Nirvâ*n*a--he emancipates his mind in Arahatship!
And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's bazaar of
flowers."

"Take with you Karma as the price,  
And go ye up to that bazaar,  
Buy there an object for your thought,  
Emancipate yourselves. Be free <span id="fr_516"></span>[3](#fn_513)!"'

 

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

7\. 'And what, venerable Nâgasena, is the perfume bazaar of the Blessed
One, the Buddha?'

'There are certain categories of virtue, O king, that have been made
known by the Blessed One, and anointed by the perfume of that
righteousness the children of the Blessed One fill with the fumes of the
fragrant incense of the perfume of goodness the whole world of gods and
men, in every direction, and to windward and to leeward, continuing to
pervade it again and yet again. And which are those categories? The
virtue of taking refuge <span id="fr_517"></span>[1](#fn_514),

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

the virtue that is fivefold and eightfold and tenfold <span
id="fr_518"></span>[1](#fn_515), and the virtue of self-restraint
tabulated in the five recitations that compose the Pâtimokkha <span
id="fr_519"></span>[2](#fn_516). And this, O king, is what is called
"The Blessed One's bazaar of perfumes." For it has been said, O king, by
the Blessed One, the god over all gods:

"No flower's scent can go against the wind,  
Not sandal wood's, nor musk's, nor jasmine flower's:  
But the sweet perfume of the good doth go  
Against the wind, and the good man pervades,  
On every side, the sweetness of his life <span
id="fr_520"></span>[3](#fn_517)."

"Red sandal wood, musk, and the lotus, and jasmine--  
The perfume of goodness surpasseth them all.  
Abundant the sweet scent of musk and of sandal wood--  
Still stronger, the scent of the good mounts to heaven <span
id="fr_521"></span>[4](#fn_518)!"'

8\. 'And what, venerable Nâgasena, is the fruit bazaar of the Blessed
One, the Buddha?'

'Certain fruits have been made known, O king, by the Blessed One. And
they are these:--The fruit of the first stage of the Excellent Way
(conversion),

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

and of the second stage, and of the third stage, and of the fourth
(Arahatship) <span id="fr_522"></span>[1](#fn_519),--the fruit of the
attainment of emptiness <span id="fr_523"></span>[2](#fn_520)--the fruit
of the attainment of the absence of the three signs (of an unconverted
life, lust, malice, and dullness)--and the truth of the attainment of
that state in which no low aspirations survive. \[**334**\] And
whosoever desires any one of these, he gives his Karma as the price, and
buys the fruit he longs for--either conversion or any other.

9\. 'Just, O king, as any man who has a mango-tree bearing fruit all the
year round, he does not knock down the fruits until buyers come. But
when a buyer has come, and the fruit-grower has taken the price, then he
says: "Come, my good man, this tree is always in bearing (it has
therefore fruits in all stages of growth), take from it the kind of
fruit you prefer, whether unripe, or decayed <span
id="fr_524"></span>[3](#fn_521), or hairy <span
id="fr_525"></span>[4](#fn_522), or sour, or ripe <span
id="fr_526"></span>[5](#fn_523)." And the buyer, for the price paid,
takes the kind he likes the best-if that be unripe fruit then he takes
that, if it be decayed fruit then that, if it be hairy fruit then that,
if it be sour fruit then that, if it be ripe fruit then he takes a ripe
one. Just so, O king, whosoever desires any one of those other fruits,
he gives his Karma as the price, and buys the fruit he longs for-

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

either conversion or any other. And this, O king, is what is called "The
Blessed One's bazaar of fruits."

"Men give their Karma as the price,  
And buy the fruit ambrosia;  
And happiness is theirs, and peace,  
Who've bought the fruit ambrosia <span id="fr_527"></span>[1](#fn_524)."

10\. 'And what, venerable Nâgasena, is the antidote bazaar of the
Blessed One, the Buddha?'

'Certain drugs, O king, have been made known by the Blessed One; drugs
by which the Blessed One delivers the whole world of gods and men from
the poison of evil dispositions. And what are these drugs? The four
Noble Truths made known by the Blessed One, that is to say, the truth as
to sorrow, and the truth as to the origin of sorrow, and the truth as to
the cessation of sorrow, and the truth as to that path which leads to
the cessation of sorrow <span id="fr_528"></span>[2](#fn_525). And
whosoever, longing for the highest insight (the insight of
Arahatship) <span id="fr_529"></span>[3](#fn_526), hear this doctrine of
the four truths, they are set quite free from rebirth, \[**335**\] they
are set quite free from old age, they are set quite free from death,
they are set quite free from grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and
despair. And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's bazaar
of antidotes."

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

"Of all the drugs, in all the world,  
The antidotes of poison dire,  
Not one equals that Doctrine sweet.  
Drink that, O brethren. Drink and live <span
id="fr_530"></span>[1](#fn_527)!"'

11\. 'And what, venerable Nâgasena, is the medicine bazaar of the
Blessed One, the Buddha?'

'Certain medicines, O king, have been made known by the Blessed One,
medicines by which he cures the whole world of gods and men. And they
are these:--"The four Means of keeping oneself ready and mindful, and
the fourfold Great Struggle, and the four Steps to Iddhi, and the five
Organs of the moral sense, and the five moral Powers, and the seven
Forms of the Wisdom of the Arahats, and the Noble Eightfold Path <span
id="fr_531"></span>[2](#fn_528)." By these medicines the Blessed One
purges men of wrong views, purges them of low aspirations, purges them
of evil speaking, purges them of evil deeds, purges them of evil modes
of livelihood, purges them of wrong endeavours, purges them of evil
thoughts, purges them of erroneous meditation; and he gives emetics to
the vomiting up of lusts, and of malice, and of dullness, and of doubt,
and of self-righteousness, and of sloth of body and inertness of mind,
and of shamelessness and hardness of heart, and of all evil. And this, O
king, is what is called "The Blessed One's bazaar of medicine."

Of all the medicines found in all the world,  
Many in number, various in their powers,  
Not one equals this medicine of the Truth.  
Drink that, O brethren. Drink, and drinking, live! <span
id="page_219">p. 219</span>

For having drunk that medicine of the Truth,  
Ye shall have past beyond old age and death,  
And--evil, lusts, and Karma rooted out--  
Thoughtful and seeing, ye shall be at rest <span
id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_529)!"'

12\. 'And what, venerable Nâgasena, is the ambrosia bazaar of the
Blessed One, the Buddha?'

'An ambrosia, O king, has been made known by the Blessed One, that
ambrosia with which he besprinkles the whole world of gods and men--as
men anoint a king on his coronation day--\[**336**\] and men and gods,
when sprinkled with that ambrosia, are set free from rebirths, old age,
disease, and death, from grief, and lamentation, and pain, and sorrow,
and despair. And what is that ambrosia? That meditation which consists
in active attention to, and leads to a true grasp of, the real
conditions of corporeal things <span id="fr_533"></span>[2](#fn_530).
For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:

"They, O brethren, feed on ambrosia who feed on active attention
directed to corporeal things <span id="fr_534"></span>[3](#fn_531)."
This, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's ambrosia bazaar."

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

"He saw mankind afflicted with disease,  
He opened freely his ambrosia shop;  
Go, then, O brethren, give your Karma for it,  
And buy, and feed on, that ambrosial food <span
id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_532)."'

13\. 'And what, venerable Nâgasena, is the jewel bazaar of the Blessed
One, the Buddha?'

'Certain jewels, O king, have been made known by the Blessed One, and
adorned with those jewels the children of the Blessed One shine forth in
splendour, illuminating the whole world of gods and men, brightening it
in its heights, in its depths, from horizon to horizon, with a brilliant
glory. And those jewels are these--the jewel of right conduct, and the
jewel of meditation, and the jewel of knowledge, and the jewel of
emancipation, and the jewel of the insight which arises from the
assurance of emancipation, and the jewel of discrimination, and the
jewel of the sevenfold wisdom of the Arahats <span
id="fr_536"></span>[2](#fn_533).

14\. 'And what, O king, is the Blessed One's jewel of right
conduct <span id="fr_537"></span>[3](#fn_534)? The right conduct which
follows on self-restraint according to the rules of the Pâtimokkha, the
right conduct which follows on

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

restraint of the bodily organs and the mind <span
id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_535), the right conduct which results from a
pure means of livelihood, the right conduct in relation to the four
requisites of a recluse <span id="fr_539"></span>[2](#fn_536), the right
conduct presented in the Short, and Middle, and Long Summonses <span
id="fr_540"></span>[3](#fn_537), the right conduct of those who are
walking in the Path, and the right conduct of those who have attained
each of the various fruits thereof (beginning at conversion and ending
at Arahatship) <span id="fr_541"></span>[4](#fn_538). And all the beings
in the world, O king, gods <span id="fr_542"></span>[5](#fn_539) and
men, and the Mâras too (the spirits of evil), and the Brahmas (the very
highest of the gods), and Samanas and Brahmans are filled with longing
and desire for a man who wears, as his ornament, this jewel of right
conduct. And the Bhikkhu, O king, who puts it on shines forth in glory
all around, upwards and downwards, and from side to side, surpassing in
lustre all the jewels to be found from the Waveless Deep <span
id="fr_543"></span>[6](#fn_540), below to the highest heavens above,
excelling them all, overwhelming them all. Such, O king, are the jewels
of right conduct set out for sale in the Blessed One's bazaar of gems.
And this is what is called "The Blessed One's jewel of righteousness."

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

"Such are the virtues sold in that bazaar,  
The shop of the Enlightened One,  
the Blest; Pay Karma as the price, O ye ill-clad!  
Buy, and put on, these lustrous Buddha-gems!"

\[**337**\] 15. 'And what, O king, is the Blessed One's jewel of
meditation? The meditation that consists of specific conceptions, and of
investigation regarding them <span id="fr_544"></span>[1](#fn_541);--the
meditation that consists of reflection only, specific conceptions being
lost sight of <span id="fr_545"></span>[2](#fn_542);--the meditation
that continues after specific conceptions and reflection on them have
both ceased <span id="fr_546"></span>[3](#fn_543);--the meditation that
is void (of lusts, evil dispositions, and Karma);--the meditation from
which three signs (of an unconverted life-lust, malice, and dullness)
are absent;--the meditation in which no low aspirations remain <span
id="fr_547"></span>[4](#fn_544). And when a Bhikkhu, O king, has put on
this jewel of meditation (Samâdhi), then ideas of lust, and ideas of
anger, and ideas of cruelty, and all the various bad thoughts that have
their basis in the evil dispositions of pride, self-righteousness,
adhesion to wrong views, and doubt--all these, since they come into
contact with meditation, flow off from him, disperse, and are dispelled,
they stay not with him, adhere not to him. just, O king, as when water
has fallen on a lotus leaf it flows off from it, is dispersed and
scattered

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

away, stays not on it, adheres not to it <span
id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_545)--so when a Bhikkhu has put on this jewel
of meditation, then ideas of lust, and ideas of anger, and ideas of
cruelty, and all the various bad thoughts that have their basis in the
evil dispositions of pride, self-righteousness, obstinacy in wrong
views, and doubt--these all, as soon as they come in contact with
meditation, flow off, disperse, and are dispelled, stay not with him,
adhere not to him. And why not? Because of the exceeding purity of the
habit of meditation. This, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's
jewel of meditation," and such are the jewels of meditation set out for
sale in the Blessed One's bazaar of gems.

"Bad thoughts can ne'er arise beneath the brow  
Encircled by this coronet of gems.  
It charms away perplexed and wandering thought.  
Make it your own, buy it, put on the crown!"

16\. 'And what, O king, is the Blessed One's jewel of knowledge? That
knowledge by which the disciple of the noble ones knows thoroughly what
is virtue, and what is not; what is blameworthy, and what is not; what
should be made a habit of, and what should not; what is mean, and what
is exalted; \[**338**\] what is dark, and what is light, and what is
both dark and light;--the knowledge by which he truly knows what sorrow
is, and what the origin of sorrow is, and what the cessation of sorrow
is, and what is the path that leads thereto. This, O king, is what is
called "The Blessed One's jewel of knowledge."

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

"He who has knowledge as his jewelled wreath,  
Will not continue long in outward form <span
id="fr_549"></span>[1](#fn_546).  
Soon will he reach Nirvâ*n*a, in rebirth  
In any world <span id="fr_550"></span>[2](#fn_547) no longer take
delight!

17\. 'And what, O king, is the Blessed One's jewel of emancipation?
Arahatship is called the jewel of emancipation, and the Bhikkhu who has
reached Arahatship is said to have decked himself with the jewel of
emancipation. And just as a man, O king, who is decorated with ornaments
made of strings of pearls, of diamonds and gold and corals; whose limbs
are anointed with akalu <span id="fr_551"></span>[3](#fn_548), and with
frankincense <span id="fr_552"></span>[4](#fn_549), and with Talis <span
id="fr_553"></span>[5](#fn_550), and with red sandal wood; who is
adorned with a garland of Ironwood blossoms, and Rottleria flowers, and
flowers from the Sal tree, and the Sa*l*ala <span
id="fr_554"></span>[6](#fn_551), and the champak, and yellow
jasmines <span id="fr_555"></span>[7](#fn_552), and Atimuttaka
flowers <span id="fr_556"></span>[8](#fn_553), and

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

trumpet flowers, and lotuses, and white and Arabian jasmines <span
id="fr_557"></span>[1](#fn_554)--just as, with all this finery of
garlands and perfumes and jewelry, he would outshine all other men,
overwhelming them with brilliant glory and splendour--just so, O king,
does he who has attained to Arahatship, he in whom the Great Evils
(lusts, and becoming, delusion, and ignorance) are rooted out, he who
has put on the diadem of emancipation of heart, just so does he outshine
all other Bhikkhus from the lowest in attainment up to those even who
are themselves emancipated <span id="fr_558"></span>[2](#fn_555),
overwhelming them in brilliant glory and splendour. And why is that so?
Because, O king, there is one diadem that is the chief of all, and that
is this diadem of emancipation of heart! And this, O king, is what is
called "The Blessed One's jewel of emancipation."

"All the people that dwell in a house look up  
To their Lord when he wears his crown of gems--  
The wide world of the gods and of men looks up  
To the wearer of Freedom's diadem!"

18\. 'And what, O king, is the Blessed One's jewel of the insight that
follows on the assurance of emancipation? The knowledge arising out of
looking back over the course <span id="fr_559"></span>[3](#fn_556)--that
knowledge by

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

which the disciple who is walking along the Excellent Way passes, from
time to time, both the Way itself and the Fruits thereof up to
Nirvâ*n*a, in review, and is aware what evil dispositions he has got rid
of, and what evil dispositions remain to be conquered--that is what
\[**339**\] is called "The jewel of the assurance that follows on the
knowledge of emancipation."

"The knowledge by which the Noble Ones know  
The stages they've passed, and the road yet untrod;--  
Strive, O ye sons of the Conqueror, strive  
That jewel--'Assurance'--yourselves to obtain!"

19\. 'And what, O king, is the Blessed One's jewel of discrimination?
The discrimination of the sense of, and the discrimination of the deeper
truths underlying the sense of the sacred writ, and the discrimination
of philological peculiarities, and the discrimination of correct and
ready exposition <span id="fr_560"></span>[1](#fn_557). And the Bhikkhu,
O king, who is adorned with these four jewels of discrimination,
whatsoever company he enters into, whether of nobles, or brahmans, or
merchants, or workpeople, enters it in confidence, neither put out nor
shy; undaunted and undismayed, he enters the assembly without excitement
or fear. just, O king, as a warrior, a hero in the fight, when accoutred
in all his harness

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

of war <span id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_558), goes down undismayed to
the battle, in the confident thought: "If the enemy should remain afar
off I can knock them down with my arrows, should they come thence
towards me I can hit them with my javelins, should they come yet nearer
I can reach them with my spear, should they come right up I can cleave
them in two with my sabre <span id="fr_562"></span>[2](#fn_559), should
they come to close quarters I can pierce them through and through with
my dagger <span id="fr_563"></span>[3](#fn_560)"--just so, O king, does
the Bhikkhu, when he wears the fourfold jewel of discernment, enter any
assembly undismayed, in the confident thought: "Should any one put to me
a puzzle turning on the discrimination of the sense, I shall be able to
explain it, comparing sense with sense, explanation with explanation,
reason with reason, argument with argument <span
id="fr_564"></span>[4](#fn_561)--and thus shall I resolve his doubts,

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

dispel his perplexity, and delight him by my exposition of the problem
raised. Should any one put to me a puzzle turning on discrimination of
the deeper truths, I shall be able to explain it by comparing truth with
truth, and the various aspects and phases of Arahatship each with
each <span id="fr_565"></span>[1](#fn_562), \[**340**\] and thus his
doubts too shall I be able to resolve, and, dispelling his perplexity,
to delight him with my exposition of the problem raised. Should any one
put to me a puzzle turning on the discrimination of philological
peculiarities, I shall be able to explain it by comparing derivation
with derivation <span id="fr_566"></span>[2](#fn_563), and word with
word, and particle with particle, and letter with letter, and one
modification of a letter by contact (sandhi) with another, and consonant
with consonant, and vowel with vowel, and accent (intonation) with
accent, and quantity with quantity, and rule with rule, and idiom with
idiom;--and thus his doubts too shall I be able to resolve, and,
dispelling his perplexity, to delight him with my exposition of the
problem raised. Should anyone put to me a puzzle turning on the
discrimination of expositions, I shall be able to explain it by
comparing metaphor with metaphor, and characteristic with
characteristic <span id="fr_567"></span>[3](#fn_564), and sentiment with
sentiment--and thus his doubts too shall I be able to resolve, and,
dispelling his perplexity, to delight him with my exposition of the

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

problem raised. And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's
jewel of discrimination."

First buy the jewel of discrimination,  
Then cut <span id="fr_568"></span>[1](#fn_565) it with your knowledge
and your skill;  
So, free from all anxiety and fear,  
Shall you illuminate both earth and heaven!

20\. 'And what, O king, is the Blessed One's jewel of the sevenfold
wisdom of the Arahats? It is self-possession, and investigation of the
system of doctrine, and zeal, and joy, and tranquillity, and
contemplation, and equanimity <span id="fr_569"></span>[2](#fn_566). And
the Bhikkhu, O king, who is adorned with this sevenfold jewel of the
divisions of the higher wisdom <span id="fr_570"></span>[3](#fn_567)
shines forth over the whole world of gods and men, brightens it,
illuminates it, and dispersing the darkness makes the light arise. This,
O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's jewel of the sevenfold
wisdom."

"The gods and men in reverence stand up  
To him who wears this wisdom-diadem.  
Show your good actions then,--that is the price,--  
And buy, and wear, this wisdom-diadem!"'

\[**341**\] 21. 'And what, venerable Nâgasena, is the bazaar for all
manner of merchandise set up by the Blessed One, the Buddha?'

'The Blessed One's bazaar for all manner of

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

merchandise, O king, is the ninefold word of the Buddha; and the relics
remaining of his body, and of the things he used; and the sacred mounds
(*K*etiyâni, Dâgabas) erected over them <span
id="fr_571"></span>[1](#fn_568); and the jewel of his Order. And in that
bazaar there are set out by the Blessed One the attainment (in a future
birth) of high lineage, and of wealth, and of long life, and of good
health, and of beauty, and of wisdom, and of worldly glory, and of
heavenly glory, and of Nirvâ*n*a. And of these all they who desire
either the one or the other, give Karma as the price, and so buy
whichever glory they desire. And some buy with it a vow of right
conduct, and some by observance of the Uposatha day, and so on down to
the smallest Karma-price they buy the various glories from the greatest
to the least. just, O king, as in a trader's shop, oil, seed, and peas
and beans can be either taken in barter for a small quantity of rice or
peas or beans, or bought for a small price decreasing in order according
to requirement--just so, O king, in the Blessed One's bazaar for all
manner of merchandise advantages are to be bought for Karma according to
requirement. And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's
bazaar of all manner of merchandise."

"Long life, good health, beauty, rebirth in heaven,  
High birth, Nirvâ*n*a-all are found for sale--  
There to be bought for Karma, great or small--  
In the great Conqueror's world-famed bazaar.  
Come; show your faith, O brethren, as the price,  
Buy and enjoy such goods as you prefer <span
id="fr_572"></span>[2](#fn_569)!"

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

22\. 'And the inhabitants that dwell in the Blessed One's City of
Righteousness, O king, are such as these: Masters in the Suttantas, and
masters in the Vinaya, and masters in the Abhidhamma; preachers of the
faith; repeaters of the Gâtakas, and repeaters of the Dîgha, and
repeaters of the Ma*ggh*ima, \[**342**\] and repeaters of the Samyutta,
and repeaters of the A<u>n</u>guttara, and repeaters of the Khuddaka
Nikâya;--men endowed with right conduct, men accomplished in meditation,
men full of knowledge, men taking delight in contemplation of the
sevenfold wisdom of the Arahats, men of insight <span
id="fr_573"></span>[1](#fn_570);--men who frequent the woods for
meditation, or sit at the roots of trees, or dwell in the open air, or
sleep on heaps of straw, or live near cemeteries, or lie not down to
sleep,--men who have entered the Excellent Way <span
id="fr_574"></span>[2](#fn_571), men who have attained one or more of
the four fruits thereof, men who are still learners (have not yet
reached Arahatship, but are close upon it), men enjoying the Fruits,
that is, either Sotâpannas, or Sakadâgâmins, or Anâgâmins, or
Arahats;--men of the threefold wisdom <span
id="fr_575"></span>[3](#fn_572), men of the sixfold transcendental
wisdom <span id="fr_576"></span>[4](#fn_573), men of the power of Iddhi,
men who have reached perfection in knowledge, men

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

skilled in the maintenance of constant self-possession, in the Great
Struggle, in the Steps to Iddhi, in the Organs of their moral sense, in
the sevenfold wisdom, in the Excellent Way, in *Gh*âna, in Vimokkha, and
in the attainment of the exalted and tranquil bliss that is independent
of form or the absence of form--yea! like a forest full of bamboos, full
of reeds, that City of Righteousness has been ever crowded and
frequented by such Arahats as these! For it is said <span
id="fr_577"></span>[1](#fn_574):

\(1\) "Men devoid of passion, and of malice, and of dullness, men in
whom the Great Evils (lust, becoming, delusion, and ignorance) are not,
men who have neither craving thirst, nor grasping desires,--these are
they who dwell in the City of Righteousness.

\(2\) "Men whose home is the forest, men who have taken on themselves
the extra vows, men full of joy, men who are wearing rough garments, men
rejoicing in solitude, heroes--these are they who dwell in the City of
Righteousness.

\(3\) "Men who sleep sitting, or on any sleeping-place that comes, or
spend their time standing or walking up and down in meditation, men who
clad themselves in cast-off raiment--all these dwell in the City of
Righteousness.

\(4\) "Men wearing the full set of three robes, tranquil, with a skin
for the fourth, who rejoice in taking but one meal each day, the
wise-these are they who dwell in the City of Righteousness.

\(5\) "The earnest and prudent, heroes who feed on little and know no
greed, content whether they receive an alms or receive it not-these are
they who dwell in the City of Righteousness.

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

\(6\) "The meditative, delighting in *Gh*âna, heroes of tranquil minds,
and stedfast, looking forward to Nirvâ*n*a--these are they who dwell in
the City of Righteousness.

\(7\) "Men walking in the path, and standing in the fruits thereof,
those who have attained some fruits thereof but are yet learners as to
the last, whose hope is directed to the utmost goal--these are they who
dwell in the City of Righteousness.

\(8\) "Those who have entered the stream, and those who, free from
stains, will only be reborn once more on earth, those who will never
return again, and Arahats--these are they who dwell in the City of
Righteousness.

\(9\) "Those skilled in the means of attaining undisturbed
self-possession, and rejoicing in contemplation on the sevenfold wisdom,
those who are full of insight, and bear the words of the Dharma in their
hearts--these are they who dwell in the City of Righteousness.

\[**343**\] (10) "Those skilled in the Steps to Iddhi, and rejoicing in
the meditations of Samâdhi, those who are devoted to the Great
Struggle--these are they who dwell in the City of Righteousness.

\(11\) "Those perfect in the sixfold wisdom of the Abhi*ññ*âs,
delighting in the sphere that is theirs by rightful inheritance <span
id="fr_578"></span>[1](#fn_575), those having the power of flying
through the air--these are they who dwell in the City of Righteousness.

\(12\) "Those of downcast eyes, and measured speech, the doors of whose
senses are guarded, who

are self-restrained, who are well trained according to the supreme
Dhamma--these are they who dwell in the City of Righteousness.

\(13\) "Those of the threefold wisdom, and of the sixfold wisdom, those
who have become perfect in Iddhi and perfect in knowledge--these are
they who dwell in the City of Righteousness."

23\. 'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus who carry in their
hearts the words of the excellent knowledge that is immeasurable, who
are free from bonds, whose goodness and fame and power and glory no man
can weigh, who (in imitation of their Master) <span

kingdom of righteousness rolling on, who have reached perfection in
knowledge-such Bhikkhus are called, O king, "The Commanders of the Faith

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus, who have the power of
Iddhi, who have learned the discriminations <span

without support, who can shake the broad earth and the waters on which
it rests, who can touch the sun and the moon, who are skilful in
transforming themselves and in making stedfast resolutions and high
aspirations, who are perfect in Iddhi--such Bhikkhus are called, O king,
"The royal chaplains in the Blessed One's City of Righteousness."

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus who have taken upon
themselves the extra vows,

who desire little and are content, who would loathe any breach of the
regulations as to the manner of seeking an alms <span
id="fr_581"></span>[1](#fn_578), and beg straight on from hut to hut, as
a bee smells flower after flower <span id="fr_582"></span>[2](#fn_579),
and then go away into the loneliness of the woods, those who are
indifferent as to their body and as to life, those who have attained to
Arahatship, those who place the highest value on the virtues of the
practice of the extra vows--such Bhikkhus are called, O king, "The
judges in the Blessed One's City of Righteousness."

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus who are pure and
stainless, in whom no evil dispositions are left, who, skilful in the
knowledge of the fall and rise of beings <span

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus who are learned in the
Vinaya (Rules of the Order, Canon Law), wise in the Vinaya, skilled in
detecting the source of offences. <span id="fr_587"></span>[3](#fn_584),

highest and best and most exceeding excellent of all conditions, who are
loved and longed for by the great multitudes--such Bhikkhus are called,
O king, "Flower-sellers in the Blessed One's City of Righteousness."

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus who have penetrated to
the comprehension of the four Truths, and have seen them with their
eyes, who are wise in the teaching, who have passed beyond doubt as to
the four fruits of Sama*n*aship, who having attained to the bliss
thereof, share those fruits with others who have entered the paths <span

"Fruit-dealers in the Blessed One's City of Righteousness."

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus who, being anointed with
that most excellent perfume of right conduct, are gifted with many and
various virtues, and are able to dispel the bad odour of sin and evil
dispositions--such Bhikkhus are called, O king, "Perfume dealers in the
Blessed One's City of Righteousness."

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus whose delight is in the
Dhamma, and whose converse is pleasant, who find exceeding joy in the
higher subtleties of the Dharma and the Vinaya <span

foot of trees, or in empty

places, drink the sweet sap of the Dharma, who plunging themselves, as
it were, in body, speech, and mind into the sweet juice <span
id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_590) of the Dharma, excel in expounding it,
in seeking and in detecting the deeper truths in the various doctrines,
who--wheresoever and whensoever the discourse is of wishing for little,
of contentment, of solitude, of retirement, of the exertion in zeal, of
right conduct, of meditation, of knowledge, of emancipation, of the
insight arising from the assurance of emancipation\[**345**\] thither do
they repair, and drink in the sweet savour of that discourse-such
Bhikkhus are called, O king, "Thirsty and drunkards in the Blessed One's
City of Righteousness."

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus who are addicted to the
habit of wakefulness from the first watch of the night to the last, who
spend day and night in sitting, standing, or walking up and down in
meditation, who, addicted to the habit of contemplation, are devoted to
their own advancement by the suppressing of evil dispositions--such
Bhikkhus are called, O king, "Watchmen in the Blessed One's City of
Righteousness."

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus who in the spirit and in
the letter, in its arguments and explanations, in its reasons and
examples, teach and repeat, utter forth and recapitulate the ninefold
word of the Buddha-such Bhikkhus are called, O king, "Lawyers (dealers
in Dharma <span id="fr_594"></span>[2](#fn_591)) in the Blessed One's
City of Righteousness."

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus who are wealthy and rich
in the wealth of the treasures of the Doctrine, in the wealth of the
traditions, and the text, and the learning thereof, who comprehend the
signs, and vowels, and consonants thereof, in all their details,
pervading all directions with their knowledge--such Bhikkhus are called,
O king, "Bankers of the Dhamma <span id="fr_595"></span>[1](#fn_592) in
the Blessed One's City of Righteousness."

'And furthermore, O king, those of the Bhikkhus who have penetrated to

subtler points of training <span id="fr_596"></span>[2](#fn_593)--Such
Bhikkhus are called, O king, "Distinguished masters of law in the
Blessed One's City of Righteousness."

24\. 'Thus well planned out, O king, is the Blessed One's City of
Righteousness, thus well built, thus well appointed, thus well
provisioned, thus well established, thus well guarded, thus well
protected, thus impregnable by enemies or foes. And by this explanation,
O king, by this argument, by this reason, you may by inference know that
the Blessed One did once exist.

\(I\) "As when they see a pleasant city, well planned out,  
Men know, by inference, how great the founder was;  
So when they see our Lord's 'City of Righteousness'  
They know, by inference, that he did once exist.

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

\[**346**\] (2) "As men, seeing its waves, can judge, by inference,  
The great extent and power of the world-embracing sea;  
So may they judge the Buddha when they see the waves  
That he set rolling through the world of gods and men--  
He who, unconquered in the fight, allays all griefs,  
Who rooted out, in his own heart, Craving's dread power,  
And set his followers free from the whirlpool of rebirths--  
'Far as the waves of the Good-Law extend and roll,  
So great, so mighty, must our Lord, the Buddha, be.'

\(3\) "As men, seeing its mighty peaks that tower aloft,  
Can judge, by inference, Himâlaya's wondrous height;  
So when they see the Buddha's Mount-of-Righteousness--  
Stedfast, unshaken by fierce passion's stormy blasts,  
Towering aloft in wondrous heights of calm and peace,  
Where lusts, evil, and Karma cannot breathe or live,--  
They draw the inference: 'Great as this mountain high  
That mighty Hero's power upon whose word it stands.'

 

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

\(4\) "As men, seeing the footprint of an elephant king,  
Can judge, by inference: 'How great his size must be!'  
So when they see the footprint of the elephant of men,  
Buddha, the wise, upon the path that men have trod,  
They know, by inference: 'How glorious Buddha was <span
id="fr_597"></span>[1](#fn_594)!'

\(5\) As when they see all living things crouching in fear,  
Men know: ''Tis the roar of the king of the beasts that frightens
them.'  
So, seeing other teachers break and fly in fear,  
They know: ''Tis a king of the truth hath uttered words sublime!'

\(6\) Seeing the earth smiling, well watered, green with grass,  
Men say: 'A great and pleasant rain hath fallen fast.'  
So when they see this multitude rejoicing, peaceful, blest,  
Men may infer: 'How sweet the rain that stilled their hearts!'

\(7\) Seeing the wide earth soaked, boggy, a marsh of mud,  
Men say: 'Mighty the mass of waters broken loose. <span id="page_242">p.

So, when they see this mighty host, that once were dazed  
With the mud of sin, swept down in Dhamma's stream, and left  
In the wide sea of the Good-Law, some here, some there,  
All, gods and men alike, plunged in ambrosial waves,  
They may infer, and say: 'How great that Dhamma is!'

\(8\) \[**347**\] "As when men, travelling, feel a glorious perfume
sweet  
Pervading all the country side, and gladdening them, infer at once,  
'Surely, 'tis giant forest trees are flowering now!'  
So, conscious of this perfume sweet of righteousness  
That now pervades the earth and heavens, they may infer:  
'A Buddha, infinitely great, must once have lived!'"

25\. 'And it would be possible, O king, to show forth the Buddha's
greatness, by a hundred or a thousand such examples, such reasons, such
arguments, such metaphors. just, O king, as a clever garland maker will,
from one heap of all kinds of flowers, both following the instruction of
his teacher, and also using his own individuality as a man, make many
variegated and beautiful bouquets,--just so, O king, that Blessed One
is, as it were, an infinite, immeasurable, heap of variegated flowers of
virtue. And I now, a garland maker, as it were in the

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

church of the Conqueror, stringing those flowers together,--both
following the path of our teachers of old, and also using such power of
wisdom as in me is,--could show forth by inference the power of the
Buddha in innumerable similes. But you, on the other hand, must show a
desire to hear them <span id="fr_598"></span>[1](#fn_595).'

'Hard would it be, Nâgasena, for any other men thus to have shown by
inference, drawn from such examples, the power of the Buddha. I am
filled with satisfaction, venerable Nâgasena, at your so perfectly
varied exposition of this problem.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_486"></span>[206:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_489) A similar question
has been already asked above, III, 5, 1 109).

<span id="fn_487"></span>[207:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_490) These are the
famous thirty-five constituent qualities that make up Arahatship (that
is, that state of mind which, from another point of view and by another
of its numerous names, is also called Nirvâ*n*a). They formed the
subject of the last discourse delivered by Gotama before his death to
his disciples ('Book of the Great Decease,' III, 61), and on my
translation of that passage ('Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 60-63) I have added
a note giving all the details.

It is perhaps worthy of remark that both here and twice else <span
id="page_208">p. 208</span> where, at pp. 37, 335 (of the Pâli), our
author reverses the order of Nos. 4 and 5--the five moral Powers and the
five Organs (of the higher sense)--which are really only the same mental
qualities looked at from two different points of view.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[208:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_491) These verses have
not been traced as yet in the Pi*t*akas.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[208:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_492) There is another
parable of the architect above, p. 34 of the Pâli (I, 53 of the
translation).

<span id="fn_490"></span>[208:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_493) Bhâgaso mita*m*, an
expression constantly recurring.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[208:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_494) Ukki*nn*a. See
*G*âtaka IV, 106.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[209:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_495) According to the
dictionaries each of those four words (ka*kk*ara, *k*atukka, sandhi, and
singhâtaka) means either a square, or a place where four roads meet. The
Si*m*halese has âpana-*k*atushka-sandhi œti, omitting the last and
certainly inexact in its rendering of the first word. Sandhi I have only
met with here in this sense.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[209:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_496) Râga-magga*m*;
literally 'the king's highways,' which also only occurs here.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[209:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_497) For pi*nd*a-dâvikâ
Hîna*t*i-kumburê (who at p. 475 gives the Pâli of all this) reads
pi*nd*a-dayakâ.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[209:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_498) Vammino yodhino.
But both Hîna*t*i-kumburê here, and the parallel passage in the
Sama*ññ*a Phala Sutta (D. II, 14), read *K*amma-yodhino.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[209:5](sbe3607.htm#fr_499) For Bha*tt*i-putta
Hîna*t*i-kumburê reads Bha*t*a-puttâ.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[209:6](sbe3607.htm#fr_500) These two
(Bha*tt*i-putta and Malla-ga*n*â) are omitted in the Dîgha.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[210:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_501) Va*tt*akârâ. See
the note above on IV, 7, 11 (p. 267 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_499"></span>[210:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_502) Lo*n*akârâ, 'salt
makers.' But Hîna*t*i-kumburê reads lohakârâ and translates lokuruwo,
'workers in metal.'

<span id="fn_500"></span>[210:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_503) 'Dantakârâ, which
in the Si*m*halese is simply repeated. There is no such word in Clough.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[210:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_504) Hera*ññ*ikâ.
Childers says 'royal treasurer,' and Hîna*t*i-kumburê 'coiners of silver
mâsakas' (ran masu tanannoya), but Subhûti (in his Simhalese gloss on
Abhidhâna Padîpikâ, verse 343) renders it 'judgers of gold' (ran
balannâ); and that this is right is shown by the context in the passage
of the Suma<u>n</u>gala Vilâsinî (p. 315), where the probably identical
word he*ññ*aka is used.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[210:5](sbe3607.htm#fr_505) Dussika.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê renders this word here by pili welendo,
'cloth-sellers,' but above (p. 262 of the Pâli) by sâyam kârako, 'dice
manufacturers.'

<span id="fn_503"></span>[210:6](sbe3607.htm#fr_506) It is instructive
that men working for hire are put here among the lowest sort of
work-people, while the slave born in the house stands in the best
company.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[210:7](sbe3607.htm#fr_507) La<u>n</u>ghakâ.
Pinu*m* kârayo, 'turners of summersets' in the Simhalese. See *G*âtaka
I, 431, and above, pp. 31, 191 of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[210:8](sbe3607.htm#fr_508) Vetâlikâ.
Vetâliyehi ma<u>n</u>galâsh*t*aka kiyannâwû in <span id="page_211">p.
211</span> the Si*m*halese (Wandi-bha*tt*ayo according to Subhûti on
Abhidhâna Padîpikâ 369).

<span id="fn_506"></span>[211:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_509) Puppha*kkh*adakâ. A
well-known low caste whose duty it was to remove flowers offered on the
shrines of the gods after they had faded. At Thera Gâthâ, verse 620,
this is called one of the meanest of occupations.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[211:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_510) Ve*n*â.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê has 'lute makers,' but this must be wrong.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[211:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_511) The Si*m*halese
says simply Weddahs (Wœddas), the well-known interesting wild men of
Ceylon.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[211:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_512) Lâsikâ, 'those,'
says the Si*m*halese, 'who as if intoxicated with joy jump about and
leap and dance.' But I think it is connected with the ancient usages to
which the lascivious swinging of the *S*aivites and Vallabhâ*k*âryas
owes its origin.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[211:5](sbe3607.htm#fr_513) On all these names
see the Introduction to part I, pp. xliii, xliv. Aparântaka and
Pâtheyyaka might there have been added, as well as puratthimo *g*anapado
(from p. 42).

<span id="fn_511"></span>[213:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_514) Hîna*t*i-kumburê
devotes a paragraph to each of these subjects for meditation.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[213:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_515) Of râga, dosa, and
moha.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[213:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_516) This stanza has not
yet been found in the Pi*t*akas. In the first line it does not seem
quite clear at first sight why Karma, of all things, should be the
price. That Indian word being too <span id="page_214">p. 214</span> full
of meaning to be translateable, is necessarily retained, and hence the
phrase 'taking Karma as the price' may convey no meaning at all. If so,
in trying to escape Scylla the unhappy translator has fallen into
Charybdis. But it must mean one of two things, either something to be
abandoned, given up; or something good which the buyer possesses, and
may exchange for the good he wants to buy. If our author means the first
it must be Karma (as one of the Upadhis), as a basis for continued
individuality, and be much the same as egoism. If he means the other,
then Karma, though standing alone, must be here used in the sense of
kusala-kamma, good Karma, that is, the effect of good deeds done in a
former life. Now our author never elsewhere uses kamma, without any
qualifying adjective, in the sense of good Karma. On pp. 7, 20, 67, 108
foll., 134, 151, 189, 302 of the Pâli the unqualified word means
throughout bad Karma, the effect of bad deeds done in a former birth. In
a few passages it is used of former deeds in a way that apparently
includes both good and bad. See especially pp. 3, 10, 146, 268. Now a
buyer, in the case put, could not give up either the bad or the good
deeds he had already done in a former life--that would be beyond his
power. He could only offer, in exchange for the good he wanted to buy,
good Karma (that is, in the sense of good deeds) either in the present,
or in the immediate future. Below, V, 21 (p. 341 of the Pâli), will be
found instances given by our author himself. It is forced, no doubt, to
call this 'a price,' but it is probably the sense intended, and so
Hîna*t*i-kumburê takes it.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[214:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_517) Taking the
threefold refuge in the Buddha, the Doctrine (Dharma), and the Order.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[215:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_518) These are
respectively the first five, the first eight, and the whole ten, of the
Precepts set out in my 'Buddhism,' p. 160.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[215:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_519) The whole of this
text is translated in vol. xiii of the 'Sacred Books of the East.' The
sîlas here enumerated are only the lower morality. The higher ethics
come below in § 12.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[215:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_520) From
A<u>n</u>guttara Nikâya III, 79. The verse is quoted in the Dhammapada,
verse 54, and also in the *G*âtaka Book, III, 291.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[215:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_521) It is not known
where these lines originally stood. But they are quoted in the
Dhammapada, verses 55, 56, and also in the *G*âtaka Book loc. cit., and
in the Suma<u>n</u>gala Vilâsinî, p. 56.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[216:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_522) The details of
these 'fruits' will be found in 'Buddhism,' pp. 108-110.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[216:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_523) As to in respect of
what, see the note above on IV, 8, 69 (p. 219 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_521"></span>[216:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_524) Dovila*m*, nilâta
says the Si*m*halese, p. 484.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[216:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_525) Kesika.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê merely repeats this word.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[216:5](sbe3607.htm#fr_526) The mango is used
in all stages--when ripe for eating, and for pickles, curries, &c., in
other stages.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[217:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_527) These lines have
not been traced as yet in the Pi*t*akas, and are probably not meant as a
quotation. 'Ambrosia' is of course the ambrosia of Arahatship.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[217:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_528) For the full text
of these 'Truths' see 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 148-150.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[217:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_529) A*ññ*â. The
Si*m*halese, p. 486, has awabodhaya. The word is rare, but it occurs at
*G*âtaka I, 140; II, 333; and at Dhammapada, verses 57, 96, always in
this sense.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[218:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_530) Not traced as yet.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[218:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_531) See the note above
on V, 3 (p. 330 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_529"></span>[219:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_532) Nibbutâ, with
allusion to the freedom and calm of Nirvâ*n*a. The verses have not been
traced as yet in the Pi*t*akas.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[219:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_533)
Kâya-gatâ-sati-bhavanâ, where each term really requires a long
commentary.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[219:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_534) It will be noticed
that Nâgasena is here really going an inch beyond his text. In that text
(which has not been traced) amata, ambrosia, means no doubt as
elsewhere, the ambrosia of Nirvâ*n*a. And the text does not say that the
active attention and the ambrosia are the same, but only that they who
feed on the one feed also on the other. Even if we translate 'are
feeding' instead of 'feed' (which is grammatically possible) a similar
argument would hold good. But though it is impossible to say for
certain, without knowing the context of the passage, the rendering above
is more in accord with Pâli usage, and more likely therefore to be
right.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[220:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_535) Not traced as yet.
All these stanzas seem to belong together, and will doubtless be found
in the same Sutta or poem.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[220:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_536) These seven jewels
(or treasures, ratanâni) of the Buddha are intended of course to
correspond to the seven treasures (also ratanâni) of the king of kings
(the *k*akkavattî). They are different from the seven Treasures of the
Noble Ones' (Ariyadhanâni) which are ethical qualities, whereas these
jewels are means to the attainment of Arahatship.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[220:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_537) Sîla, a most
difficult word to translate, as it includes so much that in English
would be expressed by the varying phrases: goodness, virtue,
righteousness, uprightness, morality, &c.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[221:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_538) Indriya; no doubt
here the six organs, that is the usual five, and bhava<u>n</u>go or mano
as the sixth.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[221:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_539) Clothing, food.,
lodging, and medicine for the sick.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[221:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_540) Translated in
'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 189-200.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[221:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_541) What we have here
are the two higher stages of the three into which Buddhist ethics
naturally falls. The morality of laymen has been included above, V, 7,
where it already passes over into that of the ordinary, unconverted
member of the Order. Here we begin with that, starting with the last
item of the previous list, and go on, through the sîlas, to the highest
ethics of Arahatship.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[221:5](sbe3607.htm#fr_542) The devas, those
gods dwelling in Sakka's heaven, and, I think, the devatâs also
(fairies, nyads, dryads, &c.).

<span id="fn_540"></span>[221:6](sbe3607.htm#fr_543) Avî*k*i, the lowest
of the purgatories.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[222:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_544) I think the first
*Gh*âna (see 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 272) is meant.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[222:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_545) Apparently the
passage over from the first to the second *Gh*âna.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[222:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_546) But insight, and
the resulting bliss, remain. Compare above, II, 2, 3 (I, 67).

<span id="fn_544"></span>[222:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_547) Compare above, V,
8, on the last three.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[223:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_548) See the note upon
IV, 8, 65.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[224:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_549) Bhavo here equal to
pa*ñk*a skandha, according to Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 491.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[224:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_550) Bhave, here
tri-widha-bhawa in the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[224:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_551) Akalu; only found
here. The Si*m*halese has agaru kalu, and agaru according to Clough is
Dalbergia.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[224:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_552) Tagara. Agil
tuwaralâ, 'logwood frankincense.'

<span id="fn_550"></span>[224:5](sbe3607.htm#fr_553) Tâlîsaka. Clough
says the Talis tree is Flacourtia cataphracta.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[224:6](sbe3607.htm#fr_554) Not in the Pâli
dictionaries. But it is mentioned in Buddhava*m*sa II, 51 (there spelt
sa*l*ala). This verse is quoted at *G*âtaka I, 13, verse 51, and the
word is there spelt sala*l*a. The Si*m*halese has salala, and the
Sanskrit lexicons have sarala. Clough identifies it, no doubt wrongly,
with the last, the Anglo-Indian Hal tree, which the botanists call the
Shorea robusta.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[224:7](sbe3607.htm#fr_555) Yûthikâ; sînidda,
says Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 492, and Clough thinks this is oleander. But
Böhtlingk-Roth say a sort of jasmine, Jasminum auriculatum.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[224:8](sbe3607.htm#fr_556) Yohombu in the
Si*m*halese. Clough says this is a creeper called Borago Zeylanica. But
does that grow in the North-West of India? According to Böhtlingk-Roth,
Atimuttaka is the <span id="page_225">p. 225</span> name of three
plants, one of which is the Gaertnera Racemosa, much cultivated for the
beauty and perfume of its flowers.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[225:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_557) The last four are
the Pâ*t*alî, Uppala, Vassika, and Mallikâ, all of which are well known.
Our author's flora and fauna are so numerous that one ought, if one had
the necessary knowledge, to be able to draw conclusions as to his own
'habitat.'

<span id="fn_555"></span>[225:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_558) On the use of
upâdây' upâdâya see above, p. 182, and below, p. 341 of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[225:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_559)
Pa*kk*avekkhana-*ñ*â*n*a*m*. That is, in looking back over the <span
id="page_226">p. 226</span> course he has followed along the Excellent
Way, he becomes conscious of having got beyond each of the obstacles
(the Sa*m*yo*g*anas) that can beset him. It is the doctrine of 'final
assurance' from the Buddhist point of view. Compare *ñ*â*n*adassana at
Dîgha II, 83.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[226:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_560) 1 Pa*t*isambhidâ.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê merely repeats the ambiguous technical terms of the
Pâli. Childers, sub voce, gives the various interpretations of other
authorities. Compare above, I, 29, 34) 36. The third and fourth seem to
me to be doubtful.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[227:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_561) Pa*ñk*âvudho;
literally 'with the five weapons on.' The expression is not infrequent;
compare pa*ñk*âvudha-sannaddha, used of a hunter, at *G*âtaka III, 467;
IV, 283, 437; and sannaddha-pa*ñk*âvudhâ, used of sailors fighting, at
*G*âtaka IV, 160. But it is quite possible that weapons different from
those here described are there meant, as they are not suited, for
instance, to the hunter.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[227:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_562) Hîna*t*i-kumburê
translates this weapon (ma*nd*alagga) simply by ka*d*uwa, sword; but
'bent blade' must mean a sabre.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[227:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_563) *Kh*urikâ. Childers
has only 'knife.' The Si*m*halese, p. 493, has kirisaya, which is not in
Clough, but is doubtless the Malay kreese. These five weapons are not
mentioned elsewhere, and as three of the five words are rare, are
probably those in special use in the country where our author lived. In
this respect it is noteworthy that the Sanskrit kshurikâ is only
mentioned, according to Böhtlingk-Roth, in the Râ*g*a Tara<u>n</u>ginî
of Kashmir, and in the title of a late Upanishad. We shall therefore
scarcely go far wrong if we understand by our author's *kh*urikâ the
famous Afghan knife.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[227:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_564) Arthayen arthaya
ga*l*apâ, &c., says the Si*m*halese. He <span id="page_228">p.
228</span> will reply by adducing parallel passages, much in the style
of modern scholarship.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[228:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_565) He gives the
principal ones, as set out in his previous arguments.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[228:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_566) Nirutti.
Hîna*t*i-kumburê unfortunately simply repeats all these technical terms.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[228:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_567) Lakkhana. As for
instance above, I. 51-62.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[229:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_568) Phaseyya; literally
'he who having bought pa*t*isambhidâ shall touch it with his *ñ*â*n*a.'
The Si*m*halese, p. 494, has spar*s*ako*t*a, which does not help us.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[229:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_569) The Si*m*halese
again only repeats these seven technical terms, except the second
Dhamma-vi*k*aya, which it renders by pra*gñ*â.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[229:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_570) Bodhi. Childers
says, 'the supreme knowledge of a Buddha.' But this is wrong, as is
evident even from the context here. The whole exposition is of
Arahatship, not Buddhahood.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[230:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_571) Hîna*t*i-kumburê,
characteristically enough for a Ceylon man, adds, 'and the Footprint and
the Bo-tree.'

<span id="fn_569"></span>[230:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_572) The first line only
of these verses is in the Sa*m*yutta III, 2, 7.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[231:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_573) Vipassakâ, not
necessarily the insight of the Arahats, as Childers says. We have seen
Vipassanâ ascribed above, p. 16 (of the Pâli), to a Sotâpanno.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[231:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_574) Pa*t*ipannakâ; so
the Si*m*halese, p. 496 (but see otherwise below, V, 21, p. 344 of the
Pâli).

<span id="fn_572"></span>[231:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_575) Tevi*gg*â, having
the pubbe-nivâsânussati-*ñ*â*n*a, the *k*etopa-riya-*ñ*â*n*a, and the
âsavâna*m* khaya-*ñ*â*n*a. See Dîgha Nikâya II, 91-94 and 97.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[231:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_576) These are the last
three, and besides them the so-called Divine Eye, and Divine Ear, and
also the power of Iddhi. See Dîgha Nikâya II, 87-90, 95-96.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[232:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_577) It is not known in
what text.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[233:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_578) Pettike go*k*are
ratâ. That is in the four Sati-pa*tth*ânas. See the passage quoted below
at VII, 1, 7, p. 368 of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[234:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_579) Anuppavattakâ. See
below, p. 363 of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[234:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_580) See above, V, 19.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[235:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_581) Importunity, or
even attracting attention in any way. See above, p. 229 of the Pâli.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[235:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_582) Compare Sigalovâda
Sutta, p. 365, and Dhammapada, verse 49: 'As a bee, injuring not the
flower or its colour or its scent, flies away, taking the nectar, so let
a sage go through the village.'

<span id="fn_580"></span>[235:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_583) That is the fall of
beings from one state of existence--their death in that state in other
words--and their rise, their rebirth, in another.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[235:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_584) *G*otaka, as a city
official, is something akin to torchbearer, lamplighter.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[236:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_585) These are six out
of the ten divisions of Vya*ñg*ana-vuddhi, mentioned in the verse at
Suma<u>n</u>gala Vilâsinî I, 177. Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 501, merely
repeats the words.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[236:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_586) Dhamma-rakkhâ,
'dharmikawû âraksha-graha*n*ayehi niyuktawû' in the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[236:3](sbe3607.htm#fr_587)
Nidâna-pa*th*ana-kusalâ; 'Âpatti ge*n*a hœra dœkwîmehi dakshawû,' says
the Si*m*halese.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[236:4](sbe3607.htm#fr_588) One word,
vu*tth*âna, is here doubtful.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[236:5](sbe3607.htm#fr_589) See Mahâvagga IX,
4, 9. 10, &c.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[236:6](sbe3607.htm#fr_590) Literally 'skilled
in form, shape, beauty.' The Si*m*halese repeats this ambiguous
expression, adding the qualification amâtyayo, 'ministers, officials.'
One would think that these would have been the judges, but our author
has already made the Arahats the judges in his Dhamma-nagara. This only
leaves him some minor official post to give away to those learned in
Canon Law, and he has chosen one as unintelligible in Ceylon as it is to
me.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[237:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_591) Pa*t*ipannâ, which
Hîna*t*i-kumburê takes here to mean Arahats, but see the note above, V,
20 (p. 341 of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_589"></span>[237:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_592) Abhidhamme
abhivinaye. A phrase very instructive as to the correct rendering of the
much misunderstood word abhidhamma. As I pointed out already in the
'Hibbert Lectures' for 1881, it is a blunder to translate it, as is
usually done, by 'metaphysics.' The whole context is taken from the
Sangîti Sutta.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[238:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_593) 'The ambrosia of
the Saddharma,' says Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 502.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[238:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_594) Dhammâpa*n*ikâ. The
Si*m*halese has Dhârmikâpa*n*ikayo.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[239:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_595) Dhamma-se*tth*ino,
which the Si*m*halese repeats.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[239:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_596) Adhisîla,
adhi*k*itta, and adhipaññâ, says Hîna*t*i-kumburê.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[241:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_597) It is perhaps such
poetical figures as this that have afforded foundation for the legend of
Buddha's footprint.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[243:1](sbe3607.htm#fr_598) The Si*m*halese is
here much expanded.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[243:2](sbe3607.htm#fr_599) Mr. Trenckner reads
'Anumâna pa*ñ*ha*m*,' the Si*m*halese has 'Mahâ Anumâna Pra*s*nayayi.'
