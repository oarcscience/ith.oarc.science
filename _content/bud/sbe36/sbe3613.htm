<P>'Just, O king, as the lion is of a clear, stainless, and pure light yellow colour; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be clear, stainless, and pure light in mind, free from anger and moroseness. This, O king, is the first quality of the lion he ought to have.</P>
<P>2. 'And again, O king, as the lion has four paws as his means of travelling, and is rapid in his gait; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, move along the four paths of saintship. This, O king, is the second quality of the lion he ought to have.</P>
<P>3. 'And again, O king, as the lion has a beautiful coat of hair, pleasant to behold; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, have a beautiful coat of righteousness, pleasant to behold. This, O king, is the third quality of the lion he ought to have.</P>
<P>4. 'And again, O king, as the lion, even were his life to cease, bows down before no man; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, even though he should cease to obtain all the requisites of a recluse--food and clothing and lodging and medicine for the sick--never bow down</P>

<P>6. 'And again, O king, as the lion is not a storer up of what he eats, and when he has once eaten of his prey returns not again to it; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never be a storer up of food. This is the sixth quality of the lion he ought to have.</P>

This, O king, is the seventh quality of the lion he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Samyutta Nik&acirc;ya, when he was exalting Mah&acirc; Kassapa, the Elder:</P>
<P>"This Kassapa, O Bhikshus, is content with such food as he receives, he magnifies the being content with whatever food one gets, he is not guilty of anything improper or unbecoming for the sake of an alms, if he receive none, yet is he not alarmed, and if he does then does he eat it without craving, without faintness, without sinking, conscious of danger, with full knowledge of the right object in taking food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_804"></A><A HREF="#fn_795"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>."'</P>

<P>'Just, O king, as the house-pigeon, while dwelling in the abode of others, of men, does not become enamoured of anything that belongs to them, but remains neutral, taking notice only of things pertaining to birds; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, while resorting to other people's houses, never become enamoured of women or of men, of beds, or chairs, or garments, or jewelry, or things for use or enjoyment, or various forms of food that are there, but remain neutral always, addicted only to such ideas as become a recluse.

Both these forms are to be derived, I venture to think, from <I>G</I>Y&Acirc; (or its more primitive form <I>G</I>&Icirc;), and not from <I>G</I>I. It is true that Childers gives <I>g</I>in&acirc;ti as third person singular of <I>G</I>I, and that (through the influence of the <A NAME="page_342"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 342</FONT></A> common word <I>G</I>ina) there has really, perhaps, been some confusion in P&acirc;li writers between the two roots, closely allied as they are both in form and meaning. But whether or not that be so elsewhere, we have here at least another instance of the frequent association of a simple verb with its own causal. <I>G</I>&acirc;peti, which occurs three times in the Milinda, and is always explained by H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; in the same way (see my notes above on pp. 171, 227 of the P&acirc;li; here he has artha-h&acirc;ni no karaw&acirc; da), i neither for <I>gh</I>&acirc;peti (as Dr. Edward M&uuml;ller suggests in his grammar, p. 37) nor for <I>g</I>&acirc;payati, but for <I>g</I>y&acirc;payati. For the apparent confusion between <I>G</I>I, <I>g</I>ayati, 'conquer,' and <I>G</I>Y&Acirc;, gin&acirc;ti, (1) 'overcome, bring into subjection,' (2) 'oppress, extort,' see the commentary on <I>g</I>ine at Dhammapada, verse 103 (quoted also at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka I, 314), which runs <I>g</I>initv&acirc;na <I>g</I>aya<I>m</I> &acirc;hareyya; and on gaya<I>m</I> at Verse 201 (taken from Samyutta III, 2, 4, 7), which is explained by <I>g</I>inanto, and at verse 104 where <I>g</I>ita<I>m</I> is explained by <I>g</I>in&acirc;ti. But in Pi<I>t</I>aka texts I know of no instance where the two roots cannot be kept quite distinct; and it is quite possible that the Dhammapada commentator, while interpreting the one root by the other, is still conscious of the difference between them. <I>G</I>&icirc;na (the p. p. p. of <I>g</I>in&acirc;ti) is not given at all by Childers, but occurs <I>G</I>&acirc;taka III, 153, 223, 335; V, 99.</P>

Childers translates ase<I>k</I>ana by 'charming,' &amp;c., apparently on the authority of Subh&ucirc;ti's English gloss on Abhidh&acirc;na Pad&icirc;pik&acirc; 597. But that meaning is rather the point of union between all the synonyms given in the verse, and not the exact meaning of each of them.
