<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>1. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, that quality of the white ant which you say he ought to have, which is it?'</P>
<P>'Just, O king, as the white ant goes on with his work only when he has made a roof over himself, and covered himself up; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, on his round for alms, cover up his mind with righteousness and self-restraint as a roof. For in so doing, O king, will he have passed beyond all fear. This, O king, is the one quality of the white ant he ought to have. [<B>393</B>] For it was said, O king, by Upasena Va<U>n</U>gantaputta, the Elder:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"The devotee who covers up his mind,<BR>
Under the sheltering roof of righteousness<BR>
And self-control, untarnished by the world<BR>

<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>2. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, those two qualities of the cat you say he ought to have, which are they?'</P>
<P>'Just, O king, as the cat, in frequenting caves and holes and the interiors of storied dwellings, does so only in the search after rats; just so, O king, should</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_327"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 327</FONT></A></P>
<P>the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, whether he have gone to the village or to the woods or to the foot of trees or into an empty house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_778"></A><A HREF="#fn_769"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, be continually and always zealous in the search after that which is his food, namely self-possession.

<P>3. 'And again, O king, as the cat in pursuing its prey always crouches down&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_779"></A><A HREF="#fn_770"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, continue conscious of the origin and end&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_780"></A><A HREF="#fn_771"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of those five groups of the characteristic marks of individuality which arise out of clinging to existence, thinking to himself: "Such is form, such is its origin, such its end. Such is sensation, such is its origin, such its end. Such are ideas, such is their origin, such their end.

<P>'Just, O king, as the rat, wandering about backwards and forwards, is always smelling after food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_773"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; just so, O king, [<B>394</B>] should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be ever in his wanderings to and fro, bent upon thought.

<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>6. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, that one quality of the mungoose you say he ought to take, which is it?'</P>
<P>'Just, O king, as the mungoose, when attacking a snake, only does so when he has covered his body with an antidote; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when going into the world where anger and hatred are rife, which is under the sway of quarrels, strife, disputes, and enmities, ever keep his mind anointed with the antidote of love. This, O king, is the quality of the mungoose he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by S&acirc;riputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'Just, O king, as the old male jackal, whatever kind of food he finds, feels no disgust, but eats of it as much as he requires; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, eat without disgust such food as he receives with the sole object of keeping himself alive. This, O king, is the first quality of the old male jackal he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mah&acirc; Kassapa, the Elder:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Leaving my dwelling-place, I entered once<BR>
Upon my round for alms, the village street.<BR>
A leper there I saw eating his meal,<BR>
And, as was meet, deliberately, in turn,<BR>
I stood beside him too that he might give a gift.<BR>
He, with his hand all leprous and diseased,<BR>
Put in my bowl--'twas all he had to give--<BR>
A ball of rice; and as he placed it there<BR>
A finger, mortifying, broke and fell.<BR>
Seated behind a wall, that ball of food<BR>
I ate, and neither when I ate it, nay,<BR>
Nor afterwards, did any loathing thought<BR>
Arise within my breast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_776"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."</P></DIR>

'And again, O king, as the old male jackal, when he gets any food, does not stop to examine it; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never stop to find out whether food given to him is bitter or sweet, well-flavoured or ill--just as it is should he be satisfied with it.

<DIR>

<P>"Bitter food too should he enjoy,<BR>
Nor long for what is sweet to taste.<BR>
The mind disturbed by lust of taste<BR>

<P>'Just, O king, as the deer frequents the forest by day, and spends the night in the open air; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, pass the day in the forest, and the night under the open sky. This, O king, is the first quality of the deer he ought to have. [<B>396</B>] For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the exposition called the Lomaha<I>m</I>sana Pariy&acirc;ya:</P>

This, O king, is the second quality of the deer he ought to have.</P>
<P>11.

<P>'Just, O king, as the bull never forsakes its own stall; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never abandon his own body on the ground that its nature is only the decomposition, the wearing away, the dissolution, the destruction of that which is impermanent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_791"></A><A HREF="#fn_782"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

'Bar&acirc;nda,' which is not in Clough, I take to be simply 'verandah,' and the whole to mean: 'or goes into the interior of a mansion with an upper story to it on which is a verandah.' Buddhaghosa on <I>K</I>ullavagga, VI, 1, 2, (putting only k&ucirc;<I>t</I>&acirc;g&acirc;ra, 'peaked chamber,' for bar&acirc;nda,) has the same explanation. Ten or twelve years is allowed in <I>K</I>ullavagga VI, 17, 1, for the building of such a pr&acirc;s&acirc;da. See also Mah&acirc;vagga I, 30, 4, and VI, 33, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_770"></A><A HREF="sbe3612.htm#fr_779">327:2</A> &Acirc;sanne is Mr. Trenckner's reading. But H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;, who translates deyat tab&acirc; hind&icirc;me<I>m</I> ma, 'sitting with its forepaws stretched out,' evidently read &acirc;sanena.</P>

But the Si<I>m</I>halese in the first clause (p. 589, last line) has patami<I>m</I> ma, 'hoping for, seeking for,' and in the second (p. 590, line 2) p&#156;t&icirc;me<I>m</I> ma, which is the same thing (from pr&acirc;rthan&acirc;, which confirms Mr. Trenckner's reading).</P>

To quote this passage here as an authority the Bhikshu ought still to follow, is a striking instance of <A NAME="page_332"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 332</FONT></A> the fatal habit of quoting texts of Scripture apart from their context. As it stands, it seems as if it supported the proposition of our author. But it is really just the contrary. For it occurs in the description given by Gotama of what he had done before he arrived at insight, when he was carrying out that system of penance which he afterwards abandoned as useless, and indeed worse than useless.</P>
