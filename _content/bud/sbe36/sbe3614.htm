<P>'Just, O king, as the road spider weaves the curtain of its net on the road, and whatsoever is caught therein, whether worm, or fly, or beetle, that does he catch and eat; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, spread the curtain of the net of self-possession over the six doors (of his six senses), and if any of the flies of evil are caught therein, there should he seize them. This, O king, is the quality of the road spider he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Anuruddha, the Elder:</P><DIR>

<P>"His heart should he shut in, at its six doors,<BR>
By self-possession, best and chief of gifts,<BR>
Should any evil thoughts be caught within,<BR>

<P>just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, adhere to his own good, and in everything--in teaching, in asking and answering questions, in the conduct of life, in the habit of solitude, in association with his teachers, in the cultivation of the friendship of the good--should he act with knowledge of the Truth. This, O king, is the quality of the child at the breast he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the D&icirc;gha Nik&acirc;ya, in the Suttanta of the Great Decease:</P>

H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;, p. 614, renders this, 'shall I arrive at the advantage of the attainment of the fruits of the path.' And he may be right, as the word uttari<I>m</I> is used. But the context seems to imply the rendering I have ventured to give, which preserves the usual connotation in this connection of the other two words of the phrase. A Bhikshu, for instance, on seeing a faded flower, will try to realise, to conjure up before his mind, the real fact of the transitoriness of all earthly (and of all heavenly) things. That is the specific idea of which he is in search, the deer he has to catch. No doubt it is only an intermediate step to the realisation of the fruits of the path. But as visesa<I>m</I> adhiga<I>kkh</I>ati is the technical term for success in such meditation, I cannot but think that the mind of our author was directed to the intermediate, rather than to the later stage of the Bhikshu's endeavour. The Si<I>m</I>halese has, perhaps, been guided by the verse, but there the word visesa<I>m</I> is omitted.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_837"></A><A HREF="sbe3614.htm#fr_846">362:3</A> This passage will be found of the greatest importance for the history of the development of early Buddhist belief. In the present state of our knowledge--or rather of our ignorance--of that subject, its obscure allusions are no doubt unintelligible. But they will not always remain so. And, when rightly understood, they will be expressly valuable inasmuch as they refer to that department of Buddhist belief of which we know, from other sources, the least. The development--or degeneration, if the expression be preferred--of Buddhist doctrine took place along three principal lines. Firstly, in the doctrine as to the person of the Buddha; secondly, in the pushing of Arahatship into the background and the elevation, in its place, of Bodisatship into the ideal; and thirdly, in the doctrine of the relation of man to the universe. We know a good deal of the growth of the legend of the Buddha, and of the change in the ethical standpoint. Of the evolution of the philosophic conceptions we know at present but little. It is on this last point that our author here lets us somewhat behind the scenes. The theses he <A NAME="page_363"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 363</FONT></A> condemns are to some extent the same as those the discussion of which is condemned in the well-known passages in the Pi<I>t</I>akas, where similar lists occur. In other respects they are evidence of a different and later stage of thought than appears in those parts of the Pi<I>t</I>akas at present accessible. And on the positive side, in the closing words, though the author has evidently enough the old Arahatship in view, yet he chooses expressions which became the germ of the much later nihilism of the M&acirc;dhyamika school, which has had so much influence in the more corrupt Buddhisms, more especially in China. As these later views never penetrated into Ceylon (or at least never had any vogue there, and were forgotten when H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; wrote), it is not surprising that the Si<I>m</I>halese scholar should be at fault in his interpretation of this difficult passage. Sanskrit Buddhist texts will be here the best commentary.</P>
