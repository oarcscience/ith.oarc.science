# BOOK VII. CHAPTER 6.

## THE SIMILES (continued).

### 51. THE ROAD SPIDER.

1\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the road spider you say he
ought to have, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the road spider weaves the curtain of its net on the
road, and whatsoever is caught therein, whether worm, or fly, or beetle,
that does he catch and eat; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, spread the curtain of the net of
self-possession over the six doors (of his six senses), and if any of
the flies of evil are caught therein, there should he seize them. This,
O king, is the quality of the road spider he ought to have. For it was
said, O king, by Anuruddha, the Elder:

"His heart should he shut in, at its six doors,  
By self-possession, best and chief of gifts,  
Should any evil thoughts be caught within,  
Them by the sword of insight should he slay <span
id="fr_826"></span>[1](#fn_817)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 52. THE CHILD AT THE BREAST.

2\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the child at the breast you
say he ought to take, \[**408**\] which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the child at the breast sticks to its own advantage,
and if it wants milk, cries for it;

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, adhere
to his own good, and in everything--in teaching, in asking and answering
questions, in the conduct of life, in the habit of solitude, in
association with his teachers, in the cultivation of the friendship of
the good--should he act with knowledge of the Truth. This, O king, is
the quality of the child at the breast he ought to have. For it was
said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Dîgha
Nikâya, in the Suttanta of the Great Decease:

"Be zealous, rather, I beseech you, Ânanda, in your own behalf. Devote
yourselves to your own good. Be earnest, all aglow, intent on your own
good <span id="fr_827"></span>[1](#fn_818)!"'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 53. THE LAND TORTOISE <span id="fr_828"></span>[2](#fn_819).

3\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, that one quality of the land tortoise which you
say he ought to take, which is it?'

'Just, O king, as the land tortoise, being afraid of the water,
frequents places far from it, and by that habit of avoiding water its
length of life is kept undiminished; just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, seeing the danger in the want of
earnestness, be mindful of the advantages that distinguish earnestness.
For by that perception of

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

danger in carelessness, his Samanaship fades not away, but rather does
he go forward to Nirvâ*n*a itself. This, O king, is the quality of the
land tortoise he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed
One, the god over all gods, in the Dhammapada:

"The Bhikshu who in earnestness delights,  
Who sees the danger of indifference,  
Shall fall not from his high estate away,  
But in the presence of Nirvâ*n*a dwell <span
id="fr_829"></span>[1](#fn_820)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 54. THE MOUNTAIN HEIGHT.

4\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of the mountain height you
say he ought to have, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the mountain height is a hiding-place for the wicked;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep
secret the offences and failings of others, revealing them not. This, O
king, is the first of the qualities of the mountain height he ought to
have.

5\. 'And again, O king, just as the mountain height is void of many
people; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, \[**409**\]
earnest in effort, be void of lust, angers, follies, and pride, of the
net of (wrong) views <span id="fr_830"></span>[2](#fn_821), and of all
evil dispositions. This, O king,

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

is the second quality of the mountain height he ought to have.

6\. 'And again, O king, just as the mountain height is a lonely spot,
free from crowding of men; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be given to solitude, and free from evil,
unworthy qualities, from those that are not noble. This, O king, is the
third quality of the mountain height he ought to have.

7\. 'And again, O king, just as the mountain height is clean and pure;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be
good and pure, happy, and without self-righteousness. This, O king, is
the fourth quality of the mountain height he ought to have.

8\. 'And again, O king, just as the mountain height is the resort of the
noble ones; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, be sought after by the noble ones. This, O king, is the fifth
quality of the mountain height he ought to have. For it was said, O
king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent
Sa*m*yutta Nikâya:

"With solitary men, those noble ones,  
Whose minds, on Arahatship strictly bent,  
Rise easily to contemplation's heights,  
Stedfast in zeal and wise in holy writ--  
With such should he resort, with such commune <span
id="fr_831"></span>[1](#fn_822)."'

 

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

### 55. THE TREE.

9\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the tree you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the tree bears fruits and flowers; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, bear the flowers of
emancipation and the fruits of Sama*n*aship <span
id="fr_832"></span>[1](#fn_823). This, O king, is the first quality of
the tree he ought to have.

10\. 'And again, O king, as the tree casts its shadow over the men who
come to it, and stay beneath it; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, receive with kindness, both as regards their
bodily wants and their religious necessities, those that wait upon him,
and remain near by him. This, O king, is the second quality of the tree
he ought to have.

11\. 'And again, O king, just as the tree makes no kind of distinction
in the shadow it affords; \[**410**\] just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, make no distinctions between all
men, but nourish an equal love to those who rob, or hurt, or bear enmity
to him, and to those who are like unto himself, This, O king, is the
third quality of the tree he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by
Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:

"Devadatta, who tried to murder him;  
A<u>n</u>gulimâla, highway robber chief;  
The elephant set loose to take his life;  
And Râhula, the good, his only son--  
The sage is equal-minded to them all <span
id="fr_833"></span>[2](#fn_824)."'

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

### 56. THE RAIN.

12\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those five qualities of the rain you say he
ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the rain lays any dust that arises; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, lay the dust and dirt
of any evil dispositions that may arise within him. This, O king, is the
first quality of the rain he ought to have.

13\. 'And again, O king, just as the rain allays the heat of the ground;
just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, soothe
the whole world of gods and men, with the feeling of his love. This, O
king, is the second quality of the rain he ought to have.

14\. 'And again, O king, as the rain makes all kinds of vegetation to
grow; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
cause faith to spring up in all beings, and make that seed of faith grow
up into the three Attainments, not only the lesser attainments of
glorious rebirths in heaven or on earth, but also the attainment of the
highest good, the bliss of Arahatship <span
id="fr_834"></span>[1](#fn_825). This, O king, is the third quality of
the rain he ought to have.

15\. 'And again, O king, just as the rain-cloud, rising up in the hot
season, affords protection to the grass, and trees, and creepers, and
shrubs, and medicinal herbs, and to the monarchs of the woods that grow
on the surface of the earth; just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort,

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

cultivating the habit of thoughtfulness, afford protection by his
thoughtfulness to his condition of Samanaship, for in thoughtfulness is
it that all good qualities have their root. This, O king, is the fourth
quality of the rain he ought to have.

16\. \[**411**\] 'And again, O king, as the rain when it pours down
fills the rivers, and reservoirs, and artificial lakes, the caves, and
chasms, and ponds, and holes, and wells, with water; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, pour down the rain of
the Dhamma--according to the texts handed down by tradition, and so fill
to satisfaction the mind of those who are longing for instruction. This,
O king, is the fifth quality of the rain he ought to have. For it was
said, O king, by Sâriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:

"When the Great Sage perceives a man afar,  
Were it a hundred or a thousand leagues,  
Ripe for enlightenment, straightway he goes  
And guides him gently to the path of Truth <span
id="fr_835"></span>[1](#fn_826)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 57. THE DIAMOND.

17\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those three qualities of the diamond you say
he ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the diamond is pure throughout; just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be perfectly pure in
his means of livelihood. This, O king, is the first quality of the
diamond he ought to have.

18\. 'And again, O king, as the diamond cannot

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

be alloyed with any other substance; just so, O king, should the
strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never mix with wicked men as
friends. This, O king, is the second quality of the diamond he ought to
have.

19\. 'And again, O king, just as the diamond is set together with the
most costly gems; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest
in effort, associate with those of the higher excellence, with men who
have entered the first or the second or the third stage of the Noble
Path, with the jewel treasures of the Arahats, of the recluses, of the
threefold Wisdom, or of the sixfold Insight. This, O king, is the third
quality of the diamond he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the
Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Sutta Nipâta:

"Let the pure associate with the pure,  
Ever in recollection firm;  
Dwelling harmoniously wise  
Thus shall ye put an end to griefs <span
id="fr_836"></span>[1](#fn_827)."'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 58. THE HUNTER.

20\. \[**412**\] 'Venerable Nâgasena, those four qualities of the hunter
you say he ought to have, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the hunter is indefatigable, so also, O king, should
the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be indefatigable. This, O
king, is the first quality of the hunter he ought to have.

21\. 'And again, O king, just as the hunter keeps his attention fixed on
the deer; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, keep his

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

attention fixed on the particular object which is the subject of his
thought. This, O king, is the second quality of the hunter he ought to
have.

22\. 'And again, O king, just as the hunter knows the right time for his
work; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
know the right time for retirement, saying to himself: "Now is the right
time to retire. Now is the right time to come out of retirement." This,
O king, is the third quality of the hunter he ought to have.

23\. 'And again, O king, just as the hunter on catching sight of a deer
experiences joy at the thought: "Him shall I get!" just so, O king,
should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rejoice at the sight of
an object for contemplation, and experience joy at the thought: "Thereby
shall I grasp the specific idea of which I am in search <span
id="fr_837"></span>[1](#fn_828)." This, O king, is the fourth quality of
the hunter he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mogharâ*g*a,
the Elder:

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

"The recluse who, with mind on Nirvâ*n*a bent,  
Has acquired an object his thoughts to guide,  
Should be filled with exceeding joy at the hope:  
'By this my uttermost aim shall I gain <span
id="fr_838"></span>[1](#fn_829).'"'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### 59. THE FISHERMAN.

24\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the fisherman you say
he ought to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the fisherman draws up the fish on his hook; just so,
O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, draw up by his
knowledge, and that to the uttermost, the fruits of Samanaship. This, O
king, is the first quality of the fisherman he ought to have.

25\. 'And again, O king, just as the fisherman by the sacrifice of a
very little comes to great gain <span id="fr_839"></span>[2](#fn_830);
just so, O king, \[**413**\] should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in
effort, renounce the mean baits of worldly things; then by that
renunciation will he gain the mighty fruits of Samanaship. This, O king,
is the second quality of the fisherman he ought to have. For it was
said, O king, by Râhula, the Elder:

"Renouncing the baits of the world he shall gain  
The state that is void of lust, anger, and sin,--  
Those conditions of sentient life--and be free,  
Free from the cravings that mortals feel,  
And the fruits of the stages of th' Excellent Way  
And the six modes of Insight shall all be his <span
id="fr_840"></span>[3](#fn_831)."'

 

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

### 60. THE CARPENTER.

26\. 'Venerable Nâgasena, those two qualities of the carpenter he ought
to take, which are they?'

'Just, O king, as the carpenter saws off the wood along the line of the
blackened string (he has put round it to guide him) <span
id="fr_841"></span>[1](#fn_832); just so, O king, should the strenuous
Bhikshu, earnest in effort, standing on righteousness as a basis, and
holding in the hand of faith the saw of knowledge, cut off his evil
dispositions according to the doctrine laid down by the Conquerors.
This, O king, is the first quality of the carpenter he ought to have.

27\. 'And again, O king, just as the carpenter, discarding the soft
parts of the wood <span id="fr_842"></span>[2](#fn_833), takes the hard
parts; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort,
forsaking the path of the discussion of useless theses, to wit:--the
everlasting life theory--the let-us-eat-and-drink-for-tomorrow-we-die
theory <span id="fr_843"></span>[3](#fn_834)--the theory that the soul
and the body are one and the same--that the soul is one thing, the body
another--that all teachings are alike

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

excellent <span id="fr_844"></span>[1](#fn_835)--that what is not done
is of no avail--that men's actions are of no importance--that holiness
of life does not matter--that on the destruction of beings nine new
sorts of beings appear--that the constituent elements of being are
eternal <span id="fr_845"></span>[2](#fn_836)--that he who commits an
act experiences the result thereof--that one acts and another
experiences the result of this action--and other such theories of Karma
or wrong views on the result of actions--forsaking, I say, all such
theses, paths which lead to heresy, he should learn what is the real
nature of those constituent elements of which each individuality is, for
the short term of its individuality, put together, and so reach forward
to that state which is void of lusts, of malice, and of dullness, in
which the excitements of individuality are known no more, and which is
therefore designated the Void Supreme <span
id="fr_846"></span>[3](#fn_837).

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

This, O king, is the second quality of the carpenter he ought to have.
For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in
the Sutta Nipâta:

"Get rid of filth <span id="fr_847"></span>[1](#fn_838)! Put aside
rubbish from you!  
Winnow away the chaff <span id="fr_848"></span>[2](#fn_839), the men who
hold  
Those who are not so, as true Sama*n*as!  
Get rid of those who harbour evil thoughts,  
Who follow after evil modes of life!  
Thoughtful yourselves, and pure, with those resort,  
With those associate, who are pure themselves <span
id="fr_849"></span>[3](#fn_840)!"'

Suttanta V, 24, translated in 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 91. The beginning of
the exhortation has been already quoted above, p. 177 (of the Pâli).

<span id="fn_819"></span>[352:2](sbe3614.htm#fr_828)
*K*ittaka-dhara-kummassa, literally 'of the tortoise who wears the
sectarian mark (on his forehead).' The Si*m*halese repeats this phrase,
which clearly distinguishes this tortoise from the other, the water
tortoise, of VII, 1, 12.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[353:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_829) Dhammapada, verse
32. The source from which the verse is taken is unknown now, and was
also evidently unknown to our author. With the closing words nibbânass
eva santike, compare verse 372, sa ve nibbâna-santike. Santike,
immediate, close,' is always used with the connotation of being in the
very presence of. The local qualification, 'near,' is upanissaya,
avidûre.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[353:2](sbe3614.htm#fr_830) Di*tth*i-*g*âla,
the net of delusions, those relating to the permanence <span
id="page_354">p. 354</span> of any individuality, and the separateness
of oneself from others, as well those now living as those in the future
and the past.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[354:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_831) This is a favourite
stanza. It occurs in the Sa*m*yutta XIV, 16-18, and is included in the
verses ascribed, in the Thera Gâthâ, to the Arahats Somamitta and Vimala
(verses 148, 266).

<span id="fn_823"></span>[355:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_832) The Si*m*halese, p.
610, is here greatly expanded.

<span id="fn_824"></span>[355:2](sbe3614.htm#fr_833) This stanza has
only been traced at present in commentaries,<span id="page_356">p.
356</span> where it is quoted with some variation. See the Commentary on
the Dhammapada, p. 147.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[356:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_834) In my note above,
I, 146, I might have referred to this passage.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[357:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_835) Not traced as yet.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[358:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_836) Sutta Nipâta II, 6,
10 (verse 282).

<span id="fn_828"></span>[359:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_837) Uttari*m* visesa*m*
udhiga*kkh*issâmi. Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 614, renders this, 'shall I
arrive at the advantage of the attainment of the fruits of the path.'
And he may be right, as the word uttari*m* is used. But the context
seems to imply the rendering I have ventured to give, which preserves
the usual connotation in this connection of the other two words of the
phrase. A Bhikshu, for instance, on seeing a faded flower, will try to
realise, to conjure up before his mind, the real fact of the
transitoriness of all earthly (and of all heavenly) things. That is the
specific idea of which he is in search, the deer he has to catch. No
doubt it is only an intermediate step to the realisation of the fruits
of the path. But as visesa*m* adhiga*kkh*ati is the technical term for
success in such meditation, I cannot but think that the mind of our
author was directed to the intermediate, rather than to the later stage
of the Bhikshu's endeavour. The Si*m*halese has, perhaps, been guided by
the verse, but there the word visesa*m* is omitted.

<span id="fn_829"></span>[360:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_838) Not traced as yet.
There are stanzas of Mogha-râ*g*a's both in the Sutta Nipâta and the
Thera Gâthâ, but this is not one of them.

<span id="fn_830"></span>[360:2](sbe3614.htm#fr_839) By putting a small
fish on his hook catches a big one.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[360:3](sbe3614.htm#fr_840) Not traced as yet.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[361:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_841) *K*â*l*a-sutta*m*.
See Dr. Morris's note in the 'Journal of the Pâli Text Society,' 1884,
pp. 76-78, where he compares Mahâ Vastu, p. 17, and other passages.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[361:2](sbe3614.htm#fr_842) Pheggu*m*. See
above, p. 267 (of the Pâli), and Ma*ggh*ima Nikâya I, 198, 434, 488,
from which it is clear that pheggu is a technical term applied to the
softer portions of every tree, no doubt the outside portions. Sâra, on
the other hand, means not pith, but heart of a tree. The Si*m*halese
words are sambulu and ara*t*uwa. Compare the ebony tree, the outside of
which is as soft and white as deal, whereas the inside is black and
hard.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[361:3](sbe3614.htm#fr_843) Sassata*m* and
U*kkh*eda*m*. See 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 149. Hîna*t*i-kumburê, p. 615,
omits these two, and is very confused in his version of the others.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[362:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_844) Tad uttama*m*
a*ññ*ad uttama*m*. The Si*m*halese omits the second uttama*m*.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[362:2](sbe3614.htm#fr_845) The Si*m*halese
takes all the four previous phrases as qualifying this last one.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[362:3](sbe3614.htm#fr_846) This passage will
be found of the greatest importance for the history of the development
of early Buddhist belief. In the present state of our knowledge--or
rather of our ignorance--of that subject, its obscure allusions are no
doubt unintelligible. But they will not always remain so. And, when
rightly understood, they will be expressly valuable inasmuch as they
refer to that department of Buddhist belief of which we know, from other
sources, the least. The development--or degeneration, if the expression
be preferred--of Buddhist doctrine took place along three principal
lines. Firstly, in the doctrine as to the person of the Buddha;
secondly, in the pushing of Arahatship into the background and the
elevation, in its place, of Bodisatship into the ideal; and thirdly, in
the doctrine of the relation of man to the universe. We know a good deal
of the growth of the legend of the Buddha, and of the change in the
ethical standpoint. Of the evolution of the philosophic conceptions we
know at present but little. It is on this last point that our author
here lets us somewhat behind the scenes. The theses he <span
id="page_363">p. 363</span> condemns are to some extent the same as
those the discussion of which is condemned in the well-known passages in
the Pi*t*akas, where similar lists occur. In other respects they are
evidence of a different and later stage of thought than appears in those
parts of the Pi*t*akas at present accessible. And on the positive side,
in the closing words, though the author has evidently enough the old
Arahatship in view, yet he chooses expressions which became the germ of
the much later nihilism of the Mâdhyamika school, which has had so much
influence in the more corrupt Buddhisms, more especially in China. As
these later views never penetrated into Ceylon (or at least never had
any vogue there, and were forgotten when Hîna*t*i-kumburê wrote), it is
not surprising that the Si*m*halese scholar should be at fault in his
interpretation of this difficult passage. Sanskrit Buddhist texts will
be here the best commentary.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[363:1](sbe3614.htm#fr_847) Kâra*nd*ava*m*. In
Childers, 'a sort of duck,' in the Si*m*halese, 'excrement.'

<span id="fn_839"></span>[363:2](sbe3614.htm#fr_848) Palâpe vâhetha.
Chaff is so often used in Pâli of frivolous talk that it is given in the
dictionaries as having that meaning. Hîna*t*i-kumburê takes it here in
the sense of men of low caste, leprous *K*a*nd*âlas.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[363:3](sbe3614.htm#fr_849) Not traced as yet.
It is not in the Sutta Nipâta. This is the only passage in which our
author gives the name of a book as the source from which he takes a
passage, when the passage cannot be found in it. See Introduction, I,
xliii.
