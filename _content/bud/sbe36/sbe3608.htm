And far away from men, keeping hard vows.<BR>
And then he saw too householders, at home,<BR>
Eating the sweet fruits of the Noble Path&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.<BR>
Considering both of these, deep doubts he felt.<BR>
'If laymen also realise the Truth<BR>
Then surely vowing vows must be in vain.<BR>
Come! let me ask that best of teachers, wise<BR>
In the threefold basket of the Buddha's words,<BR>
Skilled to o'erthrow the arguments of the foe.<BR>
He will be able to resolve my doubts!'</P></DIR>

<P>2. Now Milinda the king went up to the place where N&acirc;gasena was, and bowed down before him, and took his seat on one side. And when so seated, he said to N&acirc;gasena: 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, is there any layman living at home, enjoying the pleasures of sense, occupying a dwelling encumbered with wife and children, enjoying the use of sandal wood from Benares, and of garlands, perfumes, and ointments, accepting gold and silver, with an embroidered head-dress on, set with diamonds and pearls and gold-is there any such who has seen face to face the calm, the supreme good, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a</P>

<P>3. 'Then, O king, I will explain it. All those passages in the ninefold word of the Buddha that deal with holiness of life, [<B>349</B>] and attainment of the path, and the divisions of the excellent habit of living under vows, shall be brought to bear in this connection&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_604"></A><A HREF="#fn_601"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Just, O king, as water which has rained down upon a country district, with both low-lying and high places, level land and undulations, dry ground and wet, will-all of it-flow off thence and meet together in the ocean of great waters; so will all those passages meet together, and be brought into connection, here. And a manifestation of reasons out of my experience and knowledge shall be also brought to bear.

It will be, O king, as when an able writing-master, on exhibiting, by request, his skill in writing, will supplement the written signs by an explanation of reasons out of his experience and knowledge, and thus that writing of his becomes finished, perfect, without defect. So will I also bring to bear a manifestation of reasons out of my experience and knowledge; and thus shall this matter be thoroughly analysed, its beauty shall be brought out, it shall be exhausted, set at rest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</P>

'In the city of S&acirc;vatthi, O king, about fifty millions of the disciples of the Blessed One, devout men and devout women, were walking in the paths, and out of those three hundred and fifty-seven thousand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> were established in the fruit of the third path.

And all of those who were gods, O king, were laymen. They had not entered the Order. So these and many other billions of gods, O king,--even while they were yet laymen, living at home, enjoying the pleasures of sense,--saw face to face (realised in themselves) the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_637"></A><A HREF="#fn_628"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</P>
<P>5. 'If so, venerable N&acirc;gasena,--if laymen, living at home and enjoying the pleasures of sense, can see Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a,--what purpose then do these extra vows serve? That being so, rather must [<B>351</B>] the vows be workers of mischief. For, N&acirc;gasena, if diseases would abate without medicine, what would be the advantage of weakening the body by emetics, by purges, and other like remedies?--if one's enemies could be subdued with one's fists only, where would be the need of swords and spears, of javelins and bows and cross-bows, of maces and of clubs?--if trees could be climbed by clambering up them with the aid of the knots and of the crooked and hollow places in them, of the thorny excrescences and creepers and branches growing on them, what would be the need of going in quest of ladders long and strong?--if sleeping on the bare ground gave</P>

<P>ease to the limbs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_638"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, why should one seek after fine large beds, soft to the touch?--if one could cross the desert alone, inaccessible though it be, and full of danger and fear, why need one wait for a grand caravan, well armed and well equipped?--if a man were able by his own arms to cross a flowing river, what need he care for firm dykes or boats?--if he could provide board and lodging for himself out of his own property, why should he trouble to do service to others, to flatter with sweet words, to run to and fro?--when he can get water from a natural pool, why should he dig wells and tanks and artificial ponds? And just so, venerable N&acirc;gasena, if laymen, living at home and enjoying the pleasures of sense, can realise in themselves the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, what is the need of taking upon oneself these vows?'</P>
<P>6. 'There are, O king, these twenty-eight good qualities in the vows, virtues really inherent in them; and on account of these all the Buddhas alike have longed for them and held them dear. And what are the twenty-eight? The keeping of the vows, O king, implies a mode of livelihood without evil, it has a blissful calm as its fruit, it avoids blame, it works no harm to others, it is free from danger, it brings no trouble on others, it is certain to bring with it growth in goodness, it wastes not away, it deludes not, it is in itself a protection&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_639"></A><A HREF="#fn_630"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, it works the satisfaction of desires and the taming of all beings, it is good for self-control,</P>
<P>

<P>

<P><A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A></P>
<P>it is appropriate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_640"></A><A HREF="#fn_631"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, (he who keeps the vows) is self-dependent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_641"></A><A HREF="#fn_632"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, is emancipated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_642"></A><A HREF="#fn_633"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the keeping of them is the destruction of lust; and of malice, and of dullness; it is the pulling away of pride, the cutting off of evil thoughts, the removal of doubts, the suppression of sloth, the putting away of discontent; it is long-suffering, its merit is beyond weight, and its virtue beyond measure, and it is the path that leads to the end of every grief. These, O king, are the twenty-eight good qualities in the vows; [<B>352</B>] and it is on account of these that all the Buddhas alike have longed for them and held them dear.</P>
<P>7. 'And whosoever, O king, thoroughly carry out the vows, they become completely endowed with eighteen good qualities. What are these eighteen? Their walk is pure, their path is accomplished, well guarded are they in deed and word, altogether pure are they in manners and in mind, their zeal flags not, all their fears are allayed, all delusions (as to the permanence and as to the degree) of their individuality have been put away, anger has died away while love (to all beings)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_643"></A><A HREF="#fn_634"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> has arisen in their hearts, in taking nourishment they eat it with the three right views regarding food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_644"></A><A HREF="#fn_635"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, they are honoured of</P>

<P>all men, they are temperate in eating, they are full of watchfulness, they need no home, wheresoever is a pleasant spot there do they dwell, they loathe to do ill, they take delight in solitude, they are in earnest always. These, O king, are the good qualities with which they who carry out the vows are completely endowed.</P>
<P>8. 'And these ten, O king, are the individuals worthy of those advantages inherent in the vows--the man full of faith, ashamed to do wrong, full of courage, void of hypocrisy, master of himself, not unstable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_645"></A><A HREF="#fn_636"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, desirous to learn, glad to undertake the task that is hard, not easy to take offence, of a loving heart. These, O king, are the ten individuals worthy of those advantages inherent in the vows.</P>
<P>9. 'And all they, O king, who as laymen, living at home and in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense, realise in themselves the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a,--all they had in former births accomplished their training, laid the foundation, in the practice of the thirteen vows, had purified their walk and conduct by means of them; and so now, even as laymen, living at home and in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense, do they realise in themselves the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a. Just, O king, as a clever archer first in regular succession teaches his pupils at the training ground the different kinds of bows, the manner of holding the bow up, and of keeping it in a firm grasp, and of bending the fingers, and of planting the feet, and of taking up the arrow, and of placing it on</P>
<P>

<P><A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A></P>
<P>the string, and of drawing it back, and of restraining it, and of aiming at the mark, and thus of hitting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_646"></A><A HREF="#fn_637"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a man of straw, or targets made of the <I>Kh</I>a<I>n</I>aka plant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_647"></A><A HREF="#fn_638"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, or of grass, or of straw, or of masses of clay, or of shields&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_648"></A><A HREF="#fn_639"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>--and after that, introducing them to the service of the king, he gains the reward of high-bred chargers and chariots and elephants and horses and money and corn and red gold and slave girls and slaves and wives and lands. [<B>353</B>] Just so, O king, all they who as laymen, living at home in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense, realise in themselves the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a,--all they had in former births accomplished their training, laid the foundation, in the practice of the thirteen vows, had purified their walk and conduct by means of them; and so now, even as laymen, and living at home in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense, do they realise in themselves the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a.</P>
<P>10. 'And there is no realisation of Arahatship, O king, in one single life, without a previous keeping of the vows. Only on the utmost zeal and the most devoted practice of righteousness, and with the aid of a suitable teacher, is the realisation of Arahatship attained. just, O king, as a doctor or surgeon first procures for himself a teacher, either by the payment of a fee or by the performance of service, and then</P>

<P>thoroughly trains himself in holding the lancet, in cutting, marking, or piercing with it, in extracting darts, in cleansing wounds, in causing them to dry up, in the application of ointments, in the administration of emetics and purges and oily enemas, and only when he has thus gone through training, served his apprenticeship, made himself skilful, does he visit the sick to heal them. Just so, O king, all they who as laymen, living at home in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense, realise in themselves the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a,--all they had in former births accomplished their training, laid the foundation, in the practice of the thirteen vows, had purified their walk and conduct by means of them; and so now, even as laymen, and living at home in the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense, do they realise in themselves the condition of Peace, the Supreme Good, Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a.</P>
<P>11. 'And there is no perception of the truth to those who are not purified by the virtues that depend on the keeping of the vows. just as without water no seed will grow, so can there be no perception of the truth to those not purified by the practice of the vows. just as there is no rebirth in bliss to those who have done no meritorious actions, no beautiful deeds, so is there no perception of the truth for those not purified by the practice of the vows.</P>
<P>12. 'Like the broad earth, O king, is the character resulting from the keeping of the vows, to serve as a basis to those who desire to be pure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_649"></A><A HREF="#fn_640"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Like water is it, O king, to wash away the stain of all things</P>

<P>evil in those who desire to be pure. Like the fire is it, O king, to burn out the lust of all evil in those who desire to be pure [<B>354</B>]. Like the wind is it, O king, to carry away the dust of all evil in those desiring to be pure. Like medicine is it, O king, to allay the disease of evil in those desiring to be pure. Like ambrosia is it, O king, to act as an antidote to the poison of evil in those desiring to be pure. Like arable land is it, O king, on which to grow the crop of 'all the virtues of renunciation to those desiring to be pure. Like a wishing-gem&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_650"></A><A HREF="#fn_641"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is it, O king; for conferring all the high attainments they long and crave for upon those who desire to be pure. Like a boat is it, O king, for carrying to the further shore of the mighty ocean of transmigration all those who desire to be pure. Like a place of refuge is it, O king, where those who desire to be pure can be safe from the fear of old age and death. Like a mother is it, O king, to comfort those who desire to be pure when afflicted with the sorrows of sin. Like a father is it, O king, to raise up in those who desire to be pure and to increase in goodness all the good qualities of those who have renounced the world. Like a friend is it, O king, in not disappointing those who desire to be pure in their search after the good qualities of those who have renounced the world. Like a lotus flower, O king, is it, in not being tarnished by the stain of evil. Like costly perfume (of saffron and of jasmine and the Turkish incense and the Greek)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_651"></A><A HREF="#fn_642"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></P>

<P>is it, O king, for counteracting the bad odour of evil for those who desire to be pure. Like a lofty mountain range is it, O king, for protecting those who desire to be pure from the onslaught of the winds of the eight conditions to which men are subject in this world (gain and loss, and fame and dishonour, and praise and blame, and happiness and woe)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_652"></A><A HREF="#fn_643"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Like the space of heaven is it, O king, in the freedom from all obstruction, in the magnitude, in the great expanse and breadth it gives to those who desire to be pure. Like a stream is it, O king, in washing away for those who desire to be pure the stain of all evil. Like a guide is it, O king, in bringing safe out of the desert of rebirths, out of the jungle of lusts and sins, those who desire to be pure. Like a mighty caravan is it, O king, for bringing those who desire to be pure safe into that most blessed city of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, peaceful and calm, where no fear dwells, [<B>355</B>] Like a well-polished spotless mirror is it, O king, for showing to those who desire to be pure the true nature of the constituent elements of all beings. Like a shield is it, O king, for warding off from those who desire to be pure the clubs and the arrows and the swords of evil dispositions. Like a sunshade is it, O king, for warding off from those who desire to be pure the scorching heat of the threefold fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_653"></A><A HREF="#fn_644"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

<P>the moon is it, O king, as being longed and hoped for by those who desire to be pure. Like the sun is it, O king, as dispelling the blackness of the darkness of ignorance for those who desire to be pure. Like the ocean is it, O king, as causing to arise in those desiring to be pure the costly treasures of the virtues of those who have renounced the world, and by reason too of its immensity, of its being beyond measure and beyond count,</P>
<P>13.

<P><A NAME="fn_598"></A><A HREF="sbe3608.htm#fr_601">245:1</A> I take this to mean, 'Not to speak of comparatively small numbers who have experienced Abhisamaya, an innumerable host of laymen have reached Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a--that is, have reached, and during their lives remained in, the third stage of the Path, and attained Arahatship just before they died. Abhisamaya is used either absolutely or in composition. M&acirc;n&acirc;bhisamaya (A. IV, 38, 5 = M. I, 12) certainly, and perhaps Atth&acirc;bhisamaya, is used of Arahats, but they do not occur in our author. He uses occasionally Dhamm&acirc;bhisamaya (see pp. 255, 350, &amp;c., of the P&acirc;li) and <I>K</I>atu-sa<I>kk</I>&acirc;bhisamaya (see pp. 171, 334, &amp;c.), but more frequently Abhisamaya absolutely. Dhamm&acirc;bhisamaya, 'penetration into, clear understanding of, the Dhammas or Dhamma,' may refer to the four Dhammas of A<U>n</U>guttara IV, i (= M. P. S., IV, 2, 3), or to the comprehension of the qualities (Dhammas) of things, or (what is very much the same) to the comprehension of the principal doctrine (Dhamma) of the impermanence of all things. In the last case it would be the same thing, looked at from a slightly different point of view, as the Dhamma-<I>k</I>akkhu, the Eye for the Truths (see Suma<U>n</U>gala Vil&acirc;sin&icirc; I, 237), or as that insight (Vipassan&acirc;) which is the entrance to the Path. But the four Truths (as to sorrow, &amp;c.) are also important Dhammas, and as the expression Katu-sa<I>kk</I>&acirc;bhisamaya clearly refers to them and them only, this may also be the meaning of dhamm&acirc;bhisamaya, or at any rate of abhisamaya standing above. So at least I take the latter here. We know that the 'Eye for the Dhamma,' the perception of the first only of the t&icirc;<I>n</I>i lakkha<I>n</I>&acirc;ni (impermanence), implies and involves the entrance into the Path. Oddly enough there is as yet no evidence to show whether the perception of the cardinal doctrine of the four Truths necessarily does so too; or can do so alone, without the Dhamma<I>k</I>akkhu. If the latter, then there are two gates to the Path. And this is not only quite possible, but is the inference one might fairly draw from the constant phrase 'After the exposition of the Truths had concluded so and so attained to' one or other of the phal&acirc;ni.</P>

Above, at p. 10 of the P&acirc;li, the rendering is quite different, 'p&acirc;<I>d</I>am d&icirc; samuge<I>n</I>a.' The only translation that fits the context in both of these places (the only ones in which the idiom has, so far, been found) is 'lay before you (proofs of my) mastery (over the subject),' or something of that sort. It is a disappointing satisfaction to find that the phrase was as unintelligible in Ceylon as it is to us. In my version above I should now prefer to write instead of 'repeated his lesson to his teacher for the last time,' 'gave his teacher proofs that he had understood what he had taught him.'</P>

One explanation of this term is the knowledge of the three limitations of individuality,--its impermanence, the pain involved in the struggle to maintain it, and the absence of any permanent principle (any soul) in any individual. But it is also explained in the A<U>n</U>guttara Nik&acirc;ya III, 58, as meaning the knowledge firstly of one's own former births, secondly of other people's former births, and thirdly of the nature, the origin, and the right method of subduing sorrow and the &acirc;savas (that is, lust, individuality, delusion, and ignorance). The first triplet is identical with the three lakkha<I>n</I>as, the second with the last three of the Dasabalas, the ten powers of a Buddha. So in the Sutta Vibha<U>n</U>ga (P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika I, 1-8) the last of these three is called tatiy&acirc; vi<I>gg</I>a. Compare also 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 162.</P>

This was more especially the case where mutilation or a death sentence was concerned. Minor punishments the judges could, no doubt, order without reference to the king. See jolly, 'Beitr&auml;ge zur indischen Rechts-geschichte,' in the 'Zeitschrift der deutschen morg. Gesellschaft,' 1890, pp. 344 foll.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_663"></A><A HREF="sbe3608.htm#fr_672">268:1</A> The Si<I>m</I>halese, pp. 525-531, goes at great length into the details of all these vows, each of which it divides into stages of greater or less severity, specifying the practice to be followed in each stage. As a matter of fact the members of the Buddhist Order have not observed them in any completeness. Like the Buddha himself, the majority have undertaken only the second of the thirteen-the wearing of three robes; and the others have only been occasionally practised, and then usually only one or more at a time, by isolated members. It is true that the <I>G</I>&acirc;taka Commentary (Fausb&ouml;ll, vol. ii, p. 449) says that Upasena Vangantaputta kept the whole thirteen of the Dhuta<U>n</U>gas. But this is at variance with the older text (in the Vinaya, Nissaggiya, No. XV) giving that account of the same episode on which the story in the <A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A><I> G</I>&acirc;taka Commentary is based. The thirteen vows are not referred to at all in the rules of the Order, as translated in the three volumes of the Vinaya Texts, nor are they mentioned as a whole in any Pi<I>t</I>aka text yet published. But the thirteen names are given together in a different order in a passage twice repeated in the Pariv&acirc;ra, a late book, probably written in Ceylon (pp. 131, 193). It is there declared of each of the thirteen vows that five sorts of people undertake them--those who do so from stupidity, those who do so from vain desire, those who are mad, those who do so because the vows have been exalted by the Buddhas and their followers, those who do so from high motives. It is clear therefore that our author's doctrine of the thirteen Dhuta<U>n</U>gas is at variance with primitive Buddhism. It would require, however, a separate note on each of the thirteen to show the exact degree of this variance. The basis on which each of these observances rests can be found in the older teaching, and nearly all of them have been praised or followed, in a greater or less degree, from very early times,--not indeed as general rules binding on all members of the Order, but as supplementary or extra vows, conducive, but subsidiary to the ethical self-culture of the Arahat.</P>
