<P ALIGN="CENTER">Here ends the fifth riddle, the riddle of the archer.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">____________________________</P>
<P>Here end the two hundred and sixty-two questions of Milinda, as handed down in the book in its six parts, adorned with twenty-two chapters. Now those which have not been handed down are forty-</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>two&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_872"></A><A HREF="#fn_862"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Taking together all those that have been, and those that have not been, handed down, there are three hundred plus four, all of which are reckoned as 'Questions of Milinda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_873"></A><A HREF="#fn_863"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</P>
<P>19. On the conclusion of this putting of puzzles and giving of solutions between the king and the Elder, this great earth, eighty-four thousand leagues in extent, shook six times even to its ocean boundary, the lightnings flashed, the gods poured down a rainfall of flowers from heaven, Mah&acirc; Brahm&acirc; himself signified his applause, and there was a mighty roar like the crashing and thundering of a storm in the mighty deep. And on beholding that wonder, the five hundred high ministers of the king, and all the inhabitants of the city of S&acirc;gala who were there, and the women of the king's palace, bowed down before N&acirc;gasena, the great teacher, raising their clasped hands to their foreheads, and departed thence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_874"></A><A HREF="#fn_864"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>20. [<B>420</B>] But Milinda the king was filled with joy of heart, and all pride was suppressed within him. And he became aware of the virtue that lay in the religion of the Buddhas, he ceased to have any doubt at all in the Three Gems&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_875"></A><A HREF="#fn_865"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, he tarried no longer in the jungle of heresy, he renounced all obstinacy; and pleased beyond measure at the high</P>

<P>qualities of the Elder, at the excellence of his manners befitting a recluse, he become filled with confidence, and free from cravings, and all his pride and self-righteousness left his heart; and like a cobra deprived of its fangs he said: 'Most excellent, most excellent, venerable N&acirc;gasena! The puzzles, worthy of a Buddha to solve, have you made clear. There is none like you, amongst all the followers of the Buddha, in the solution of problems, save only S&acirc;riputta, the Elder, himself, the Commander of the Faith. Pardon me, venerable N&acirc;gasena, my faults. May the venerable N&acirc;gasena accept me as a supporter of the faith, as a true convert from to-day onwards as long as life shall last!'</P>
<P>21. Thenceforward the king and his mighty men continued in paying honour to N&acirc;gasena. And the king had a Wih&acirc;ra built called 'The Milinda Wih&acirc;ra,' and handed it over to N&acirc;gasena, the Elder, and waited upon him and all the multitude of the Arahat Bhikshus of whom he was the chief with the four requisites of the Bhikshu's life. And afterwards, taking delight in the wisdom of the Elder, he handed over his kingdom to his son, and abandoning the household life for the houseless state, grew great in insight, and himself attained to Arahatship! Therefore is it said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'Wisdom is magnified o'er all the world,<BR>
And preaching for the endurance of the Faith.<BR>
When they, by wisdom, have put doubt aside<BR>
The wise reach upward to that Tranquil State.<BR>
That man in whom wisdom is firmly set,<BR>
And mindful self-possession never fails,<BR>
He is the best of those who gifts receive,<BR>
The chief of men to whom distinction's given. <A NAME="page_375"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 375</FONT></A><BR>

[S&icirc;na<I>t</I>i is merely the Elu form of the Si<I>m</I>halese word H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i, which is the name of a plant, coryza sativa; and H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; is the locative of the name of the place, H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-field, where he was born. Every unn&acirc;ns&ecirc; in Ceylon has such a local name in addition to his religious name. And the religious names being often identical (there are, for instance, many Suma<U>n</U>galas), the Bhikkhus are usually spoken of by the former, and not by the latter.]</P></P><P><HR>
