VESSANTARA'S GIVING&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.]</P>
<P>1. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, do all the Bodisats give away their wives and children, or was it only Vessantara the king who did so?'</P>
<P>'All of them do so, not Vessantara only.'</P>
<P>[<B>275</B>] 'Do they then give them away with their own consent?'</P>
<P>'The wife, O king, was a consenting party. But the children, by reason of their tender age, lamented. Had they thoroughly understood, they too would have approved.'</P>
<P>'A hard thing, N&acirc;gasena, was it that the Bodisat carried out, in that he gave away his own children, his only ones, dearly beloved, into slavery to the Brahman. And this second action was harder still, that he bound his own children, his only ones, and dearly beloved, young and tender though they were, with the jungle rope, and then, when he saw them being dragged along&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by the Brahman,--their hands</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A></P>
<P>bruised by the creeper,--yet could look on at the sight. And this third action was even harder still, that when his boy ran back to him, after loosing the bonds by his own exertion, then he bound him again with the jungle rope and again gave him away. And this fourth action was even harder still, that when the children, weeping, cried: "Father dear, this ogre is leading us away to eat us!" he should have appeased them by saying: "Don't be afraid." And this fifth action was even harder still, that when the prince, <I>G</I>&acirc;li, fell weeping at his feet, and besought him, saying: "Be satisfied, father dear, only keep Ka<I>n</I>h&acirc;gin&acirc; (his little sister). I will go away with the ogre. Let him eat me!"--that even then he would not yield. And this sixth action was even harder still, that when the boy <I>G</I>&acirc;li, lamenting, exclaimed: "Have you a heart of stone then, father, that you can look upon us, miserable, being led away by the ogre into the dense and haunted jungle, and not call us back?"--that he still had no pity. And this seventh action was even harder still, that when his children were thus led away to nameless horrors until they passed gradually to their bitter fate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, out of sight--that then his heart did not break, utterly break! What, pray, has the man who seeks to gain merit to do with bringing sorrow on others! Should he not rather give himself away?'</P>
<P>2. 'It is because what he did, O king, was so</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></P>
<P>difficult, that the sound of the fame of the Bodisat was spread abroad among gods and men through the ten thousand world systems--[<B>276</B>] that the gods exalt him in heaven; and the Titans in the Titan-world, and the Garu<I>d</I>as in their abodes, and the N&acirc;gas in the N&acirc;ga-world, and the Yakshas where they dwell--that through the ages the reputation of this his glory has been handed down by successive tradition--till now, to-day, it has reached to this meeting of ours, at which we sitting are, forsooth, disparaging and casting a slur on that gift&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, debating whether it were well given or ill! But that high praise, O king, shows forth the ten great qualities of the intelligent, and wise, and able, and subtle-minded Bodisats. And what are the ten? Freedom from greed, the not clinging (to any worldly aim), self-sacrifice, renunciation, the never turning back again (to the lower state), the equal delicacy and greatness, the incomprehensibility, the rarity, and the peerlessness of Buddhahood. In all these respects is it that the fame of that giving shows forth the great qualities of the Bodisats.'</P>
<P>3. 'What, venerable N&acirc;gasena? he who gives gifts in such a way as to bring sorrow upon others--does that giving of his bring forth fruit in happiness, does it lead to rebirth in states of bliss?'</P>
<P>'Yes, O king. What can be said (to the contrary)?'</P>
<P>'I pray you, N&acirc;gasena, give me a reason for this.'</P>
<P>'Suppose, O king, there were some virtuous Sama<I>n</I>a or Brahman, of high character, and he were</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A></P>
<P>paralysed, or a cripple&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, or suffering from some disease or other, and some man desirous of merit were to have him put into a carriage, and taken to the place he wished to go to. Would happiness accrue to that man by reason thereof, would that be an act leading to rebirth in states of bliss?'</P>
<P>'Yes, Sir. What can be said (to the contrary)? That man would thereby acquire a trained elephant, or a riding-horse, or a bullock-carriage, on land a land-vehicle and on water a water-vehicle, in heaven a vehicle of the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_298"></A><A HREF="#fn_296"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and on earth one that men could use,--from birth to birth there would accrue to him that which in each would be appropriate and fit,--and joys appropriate would come to him, and he would pass from state to state of bliss, and by the efficacy of that act mounting on the vehicle of Iddhi he would arrive at the longed-for goal, the city of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a itself.'</P>
<P>'But then, O king, a gift given in such a way as to bring sorrow upon others does bring forth fruit in happiness, does lead to rebirth in states of bliss [<B>277</B>],--inasmuch as that man by putting the cart-bullocks to pain would attain such bliss.</P>
<P>4. 'And hear another reason, O king, for the same thing. Suppose some monarch were to raise from his subjects a righteous tax, and then by the issue of a command were to bestow thereout a gift, would that monarch, O king, enjoy any happiness on that account, would that be a gift leading to rebirth in states of bliss</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A></P>
<P>'Certainly, Sir. What can be said against it? On that account the monarch would receive a hundred thousandfold, he might become a king of kings, a god above the gods, or Brahm&acirc; lord of the Brahm&acirc; gods, or a chief among the Samanas, or a leader of the Brahmans, or the most excellent among the Arahats.'</P>
<P>'Then, O king, a gift given in such a way as to bring sorrow upon others does bring forth fruit in happiness, does lead to rebirth in states of bliss--inasmuch as that monarch by giving as a gift what was gained by harassing his people with taxation would enjoy such exceeding fame and glory.'</P>
<P>5. 'But, venerable N&acirc;gasena, what was given by Vessantara the king was an excessive gift; in that he gave his own wife as wife to another man, and his own children, his only ones, into slavery to a Brahman. And excessive giving is by the wise in the world held worthy of censure and of blame. Just, N&acirc;gasena, as under too much weight the axle-tree of a cart would break, or a ship would sink, as his food would disagree with him who ate too much, or the crops would be ruined by too heavy rain, or bankruptcy would follow too lavish generosity, or fever would come from too much heat, or a man would go mad from excessive lust, or become guilty of an offence through excessive anger, or fall into sin through excessive stupidity, or into the power of robbers through too much avarice, or be ruined by needless fear, or as a river would overflow through excessive inflow, or a thunderbolt fall through too much wind, or porridge boil over through too hot a fire, or a man who wandered</P>
<P><A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A></P>
<P>about too much&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_299"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> would not live long-just, so, N&acirc;gasena, is excessive giving held by the wise in the world as worthy of censure and of blame. And as king Vessantara's gift was excessive [<B>278</B>] no good result could be expected from it.'</P>
<P>6. 'Giving exceedingly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_300"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, O king, is praised, applauded, and approved by the wise in the world; and they who give away anything as a gift just as it may occur to them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_301"></A><A HREF="#fn_299"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, acquire fame in the world as very generous givers. Just, O king, as when a man has taken hold of a wild root which by its extraordinary virtues is divine, that moment he becomes invisible even to those standing within arm's length--just as a medicinal herb by the exceeding power of its nature will utterly kill pain, and put an end to disease--just as fire burns by its exceeding heat, and water puts that fire out by its exceeding cold--just as by its exceeding purity a lotus remains undefiled by water or by mud--just as a (magic) gem by the extraordinary virtue inherent in it procures the granting of every wish--just as lightning by its marvellous quick sharpness cleaves asunder even the diamonds, pearls, and crystals--just as the earth by its exceeding size can support men, and snakes, and wild beasts, and birds, and the waters,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></P>
<P>and rocks, and hills, and trees--just as the ocean by its exceeding greatness can never be quite filled--just as Sineru by its mighty weight remains immoveable, and space by the greatness of its wide extent is infinite, and the sun by its mighty glory dissipates the darkness--just as the lion in the greatness of its lineage is free from fear--just as a wrestler in the greatness of his might easily lifts up his foe-just as a king by the excellence of his justice becomes overlord, and a Bhikkhu by reason of his very righteousness becomes an object of reverence to N&acirc;gas, and Yakshas, and men, and M&acirc;ras--just as a Buddha by the excellence of his supremacy is peerless--just so, O king, is exceeding generosity praised, applauded, and approved by the wise in the world; and they who give away anything as a gift, just as it may occur to them, acquire in the world the fame of being nobly generous. And by his mighty giving Vessantara the king, O king, was praised, and lauded, and exalted, and magnified, and famous throughout the ten thousand world systems, and by reason, too, of that mighty giving is it that he, the king Vessantara, has, now in our days, become the Buddha, the chief of gods and men.</P>
<P>7. 'And now, O king, tell me--is there anything in the world which should be withheld as a gift, and not bestowed, when one worthy of a gift, one to whom it is one's duty to give&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is there?'</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A></P>
<P>'There are ten sorts of gifts, N&acirc;gasena, in the world that are commonly disapproved of as gifts. And what are the ten? Strong drink, N&acirc;gasena, and festivals in high places&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_303"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and women, and buffaloes, and suggestive [<B>279</B>] paintings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and weapons, and poison, and chains, and fowls, and swine, and false weights and measures. All these, N&acirc;gasena, are disapproved of in the world as gifts, and those who give such presents become liable to rebirth in states of woe.'</P>
<P>'I did not ask you, O king, what kinds of gifts are not approved of. But this, O king, I asked: "Is there anything in the world which ought to be withheld, and not bestowed as a gift, if one worthy of a gift were present?"'</P>
<P>'No, Sir. When faith arises in their hearts some give food to those worthy of gifts, and some give clothes, and some give bedding, and some give dwellings, and some give mats or robes, and some give slave girls or slaves, and some give fields or premises, and some give bipeds or quadrupeds, and</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A></P>
<P>some give a hundred&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or a thousand or a hundred thousand, and some give the kingdom itself, and some give away even their own life.'</P>
<P>'But then, O king, if some give away even their own lives, why do you so violently attack&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Vessantara, that king of givers, for the virtuous bestowal of his child and wife? Is there not a general practice in the world, an acknowledged custom, according to which it is allowable for a father who has fallen into debt, or lost his livelihood, to deposit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> his son in pledge, or sell him?'</P>
<P>'Yes, that is so.'</P>
<P>'Well, in accordance therewith was it that Vessantara, O king, in suffering and distress at not having obtained the insight of the Omniscient Ones, pledged and sold his wife and children for that spiritual treasure. So that he gave away what other people had given away, he did what other people had done. Why then do you, O king, so violently attack him, the king of givers?'</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A></P>
<P>8. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, I don't blame him for giving, but for not having made a barter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with the beggar, and given away himself rather, instead of his wife and children.'</P>
<P>[<B>280</B>] 'That, O king, would be an act of a wrong doer, to give himself when he was asked for his wife and children. For the thing asked for, whatever it is, is that which ought to be given. And such is the practice of the good. Suppose, O king, a man were to ask that water should be brought, would any one who then brought him food have done what he wanted?'</P>
<P>'No, Sir. The man who should have given what he first asked to be brought would have done what he wanted.'</P>
<P>'Just so, O king, when the Brahman asked Vessantara the king for his wife and children, it was his wife and children that he gave. If the Brahman, O king, had asked for Vessantara's body, then would Vessantara have not saved his body, he would neither have trembled nor been stained (by the love of self), but would have given away and abandoned his own body. If, O king, any one had come up to Vessantara the king, and asked of him, saying: "Become my slave," then would he have given away and abandoned his own self, and in so giving would he have felt no pain.</P>
<P>9. 'Now the life of king Vessantara, O king, was a good thing shared in by many--just as meats when cooked are shared in by many, or as a tree covered with fruit is shared in by many flocks of</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A></P>
<P>birds. And why so? Because he had said to himself: "Thus acting may I attain to Buddhahood." As a man in need, O king, who is wandering about in his search after wealth, will have to pass along goat-tracks, and through jungles full of stakes and sticks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_309"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and doing merchandise by sea and land, will devote his actions, words, and thoughts to the attainment of wealth--just so, O king, did Vessantara, the king of givers, who was longing for the treasure of Buddhahood, for the attainment of the insight of the Omniscient Ones, by offering up to anyone who begged of him his property and his corn, his slave girls and his slaves, his riding animals and carriages, all that he possessed, his wife and children and himself, seek after the Supreme Enlightenment. Just, O king, as an official who is anxious for the seal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_310"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and for the office of the custody thereof [<B>281</B>], will exert himself to the attainment of the seal by sacrificing everything in his house--property and corn, gold and silver, everything--just so, O king, did Vessantara, the king of givers, by giving away all that he had, inside his house and out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_311"></A><A HREF="#fn_309"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, by giving even his life for others, seek after the Supreme Enlightenment.</P>
<P>10. 'And further, O king, Vessantara, the king of givers, thought thus: "It is by giving to him precisely what he asks for, that I shall be of service</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A></P>
<P>to the Brahman:" and therefore did he bestow upon him his wife and children. It was not, O king, out of dislike to them that he gave them away, not because he did not care to see them more, not because he considered them an encumbrance or thought he could no longer support them, not (in annoyance) with the wish of being relieved of what was not pleasant to him--but because the jewel treasure of omniscience was dear to him, for the sake of the insight of the Omniscient Ones, did he bestow that glorious gift,--immeasurable, magnificent, unsurpassed--of what was near and dear to him, greatly beloved, cherished as his own life, his own children and his wife! For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god of gods, in the <I>K</I>ariy&acirc; Pi<I>t</I>aka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_312"></A><A HREF="#fn_310"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"'Twas not through hatred&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_313"></A><A HREF="#fn_311"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of my children sweet,<BR>
'Twas not through hatred of my queen, Madd&icirc;,<BR>
Thraller of hearts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="#fn_312"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>--not that I loved them less--<BR>
But Buddhahood more, that I renounced them all."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A></P>
<P>'Now at that time, O king, Vessantara, when he had given away his wife and children, entered the leaf hut, and sat down there. And heavy grief fell upon him distressed by his exceeding love for them, and his very heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_315"></A><A HREF="#fn_313"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> became hot, and hot breath, too much to find its way through the nose, came and went through his mouth, and tears rolled in drops of blood from his eyes. Such was the grief, O king, with which Vessantara gave to the Brahman his wife and children in the thought that his practice of giving should not be broken in upon. But there were two reasons, O king, why he thus gave them away. What are those two? That his practice of giving should not be interrupted was one; the other was that as a result of his so doing his children, distressed by living with him only on wild roots and fruits, should eventually be set free by their new master. [<B>282</B>] For Vessantara knew, O king: "No one is capable of keeping my children as slaves. Their grandfather will ransom the children, and so they will come back to me." These are the two reasons why he gave his children away to the Brahman.</P>
<P>12. 'And further, O king, Vessantara knew:</P>
<P>"This Brahman is worn out, aged, well stricken in years, weak and broken, leaning on a stick, he has drawn near the end of his days, his merit is small, he will not be capable of keeping my children as</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A></P>
<P>slaves." Would a man be able, O king, by his ordinary power, to seize the moon and the sun&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_316"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A></P>
<P>mighty and powerful as they are, keeping them in a basket or a box, to use them, deprived of their light, as plates?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Neither, O king, could any one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of Vessantara, who were to the world like the moon and the sun in glory.</P>
<P>13. 'And hear another reason, O king, for the same thing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. That wondrous gem, O king of a sovran overlord, bright and beautiful, with its eight facets so well cut, four cubits in thickness, and in circumference&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_318"></A><A HREF="#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> as the nave of a cart-wheel, could no man, wrapping it up in a cloth and putting it into a basket, keep and use as a hone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_319"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to grind his scissors&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> upon. And neither, O king, could any one soever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of Vessantara, like to the jewels of the lord of the world in glory.</P>
<P>14. 'And hear, O king, another reason. just as the elephant king Uposatha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_321"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, gentle and handsome, eight cubits in height and nine in girth and length, showing the signs of rut in three places on his body, all white, sevenfold firm&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_322"></A><A HREF="#fn_320"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, could never by any one</P>

<P>15. 'And hear, O king, another reason. Just, O king, as the mighty ocean is great in length and breadth, and deep, not to be measured, and hard to cross, impossible to fathom or to cover up, and no one could close it in and make use of it as a single ferry, just so could no one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of Vessantara, as esteemed in the world as the mighty ocean.</P>

<P>mighty bonfire burning on a mountain top would be visible afar off in the darkness and the gloom of night, so was Vessantara the king well known among men, and therefore could no one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of so distinguished a man--for just as at the time of the flowering of the N&acirc;ga trees&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the Him&acirc;laya mountains, when the soft winds (of spring)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are blowing, the perfume of the flowers is wafted for ten leagues, or for twelve [<B>284</B>], so was the sound of the fame of king Vessantara noised abroad, and the sweet perfume of his righteousness wafted along for thousands of leagues, even up to the abodes of the Akani<I>tth</I>a, (the highest of all) gods, passing on its way the dwelling places of the gods and Asuras, of the Garudas and Gandhabbas, of the Yakshas and R&acirc;kshasas, of the Mahoragas and Kinnaras, and of Indra the monarch of the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!

<P>17. 'And the young prince <I>G</I>&acirc;li, O king, was instructed by his father, Vessantara, in these words: "When your grandfather, my child, shall ransom you with wealth that he gives to the Brahman, let him buy you back for a thousand ounces of gold&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and when he ransoms your sister Ka<I>n</I>h&acirc;<I>g</I>in&acirc; let him buy her back for a hundred slaves and a hundred slave girls and a hundred elephants and a hundred horses and a hundred cows and a hundred buffaloes and a hundred ounces of gold.

For all the Buddhas are exactly alike in all the Buddha-qualities.'</P>
<P>'But if, N&acirc;gasena, that be so, what is the reason that it was only the Gotama Bodisat who carried out the penance?'</P>
<P>'Gotama the Bodisat had gone forth from the world, O king, when his knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> was immature, and his wisdom was immature. And it was when he was bringing that immature knowledge to maturity that he carried out the penance.'</P>
<P>19. 'Why then, N&acirc;gasena, was it that he thus went forth with knowledge and with wisdom immatured? Why did he not first mature his knowledge, and then, with his knowledge matured, renounce the world?'</P>
<P>'When the Bodisat, O king, saw the women of his harem all in disorder&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, then did he become disgusted,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A></P>
<P>and in him thus disgusted discontent sprang up. And on perceiving that his heart was filled with discontent, a certain god of those that wait on Death (M&acirc;ra) thought: "This now is the time to dispel that discontent of his heart," and standing in the air he gave utterance to these words: "O honourable one! O fortunate one! Be not thou distressed. On the seventh day from this the heavenly treasure of the Wheel shall appear to thee, with its thousand spokes, its tire, and its nave, complete and perfect; and the other treasures, those that walk on earth and those that travel through the sky, shall come to thee of their own accord; and the words of command of thy mouth shall bear sway over the four great continents and the two thousand dependent isles; and thou shalt have above a thousand sons, heroes mighty in strength to the crushing out of the armies of the foe; and with those sons surrounding thee thou, master of the Seven Treasures, shalt rule the world!" [<B>286</B>] But even as if a bar of iron, heated the livelong day and glowing throughout, had entered the orifice of his ear, so was it that those words, O king, entered the ear of the Bodisat. And to the natural distress he already felt there was added, by that utterance of the god, a further emotion, anxiety, and fear. just as a mighty fiery furnace, were fresh fuel thrown on it, would the more furiously burn--just as the broad earth, by nature moist, and already swampy through the water dripping on it from the vegetation and the grass that have arisen on it, would become more muddy still when a great rain cloud had poured out rain upon it--so to the distress that he already felt there was</P>
<P><A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A></P>
<P>added, by that utterance of the god, a further emotion, anxiety, and fear.'</P>
<P>20. 'But tell me, N&acirc;gasena, if the heavenly Wheel-treasure had, on the seventh day, appeared to the Bodisat, would he, the Wheel having appeared, have been turned back from his purpose?'</P>
<P>'No Wheel-treasure appeared, O king, on the seventh day to the Bodisat. For rather that was a lie that was told by that god with the object of tempting him. And even had it appeared, yet would not the Bodisat have turned aside. And why not? Because the Bodisat, O king, had firmly grasped (the facts of) the impermanence (of all things, of) the suffering (inherent in existence as an individual, of) the absence of a soul (in any being made up of the five Skandhas), and had thus arrived at the destruction of the attachment (to individuality which arises from lust, or from heresy, or from dependence upon outward acts, or from delusions as to the possession of a permanent soul)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The water, O king, which flows into the river Ganges from the Anottata lake, and from the Ganges river into the great ocean, and from the great ocean into the openings into the</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A></P>
<P>regions under the earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--would that water, after it had once entered that opening, turn back and flow again into the great ocean, and from the great ocean into the Ganges river, and from the Ganges river into the Anottata lake?'</P>
<P>[<B>287</B>] 'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'In the same way, O king, it was for the sake of that last existence of his that the Bodisat had matured merit through the immeasurable aeons of the past. He had now reached that last birth, the knowledge of the Buddhas had grown mature in him, in six years he would become a Buddha, all-knowing, the highest being in the world. Would then the Bodisat, for the sake of the Wheel-treasure, turn back?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'No! Though the great earth, O king, with all its peaks and mountain ranges, should turn back, yet the Bodisat would not before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though the water of the Ganges should flow backwards up the stream, yet the Bodisat would not turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though the mighty ocean with its immeasurable waters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> should dry up like the water in the footprint of a cow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, yet would not the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though Sineru, the king of the mountains,</P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A></P>
<P>should split up into a hundred or a thousand fragments, yet would not the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though the sun and moon with all the stars should fall, like a clod, upon the ground, yet would not the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though the expanse of heaven should be rolled up like a mat, yet would not the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood! And why not? Because he had torn asunder every bond.'</P>
<P>21. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, how many bonds are there in the world?'</P>
<P>'There are these ten bonds in the world, O king, bound by which men renounce not the world, or turn back again to it. And what are the ten? A mother, O king, is often a bond, and a father, and a wife, and children, and relations, and friends, and wealth, and easy income, [<B>288</B>] and sovranty, and the five pleasures of sense. These are the ten bonds common in the world, bonds bound by which men renounce not the world or turn back to it. And all these bonds had the Bodisat, O king, burst through. And therefore could he not, O king, turn back.'</P>
<P>22. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, if the Bodisat, on discontent arising in his heart at the words of the god, though his knowledge (of the four Truths) was yet imperfect, and his insight of a Buddha not mature, did nevertheless go forth into renunciation of the world, of what advantage was penance to him then? Ought he not rather, awaiting the maturity of his knowledge, to have lived in the enjoyment of all (suitable) foods?'</P>
<P>'There are, O king, these ten sorts of individuals who are despised and contemned in the world,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A></P>
<P>thought shameful, looked down upon, held blameworthy, treated with contumely, not loved. And what are the ten? A woman without a husband, O king, and a weak creature, and one without friends or relatives, and a glutton, and one dwelling in a disreputable family, and the friend of sinners, and he whose wealth has been dissipated, and he who has no character, and he who has no occupation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and he who has no means. These are the ten despised and contemned in the world, thought shameful, looked down upon, held blameworthy, treated with contumely, not loved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. It was on calling these conditions to mind, O king, that this idea occurred to the Bodisat: "Let me not incur blame among gods and men as being without occupation or without means! Let me as a master in action, held in respect by reason of action, one having the supremacy which arises from action, one whose conduct is based upon action, one who carries action (into every concern of life)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, one who has his dwelling in action, be constant in earnestness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_350"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>." That was the spirit, O king, in which the Bodisat, when he was bringing his knowledge to maturity, undertook the practice of penance.'</P>

<P>twenty-five qualities, O king, which are causes of weakness of mind, weakened by which the mind cannot successfully be devoted to the destruction of the &Acirc;savas. (And of these it was) hunger and thirst, O king, which had then seized hold of the body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the Bodisat. And his body being thus, as it were, "possessed," his mind was not rightly devoted to the destruction of the &Acirc;savas. Now the Bodisat, O king, through the immeasurable &aelig;ons of the past, had followed after the perception of the Four Noble Truths through all of his successive births. Is it then possible that in his last existence, in the birth in which that perception was to arise, there should be any confusion in his mind as to the way? But nevertheless there arose, O king, in the Bodisat's mind the thought: "May there not now be some other way to the wisdom (of a Buddha)?" And already before that, O king, when he was only one month old, when his father the Sakya was at work (ploughing), the Bodisat, placed in his sacred cot for coolness under the shade of the <I>G</I>ambu tree, sat up crosslegged, and putting away passion, free from all evil conditions of heart, he entered into and remained in the first <I>Gh</I>&acirc;na--a state of joy and ease, born of seclusion, full of reflection, full of investigation, [<B>290</B>] and so into the second, and so into the third, and so into the fourth <I>Gh</I>&acirc;na&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</P>

And so still vice must be the more powerful, not virtue. just, N&acirc;gasena, as the strong man who, when he enters into a terrible battle, is able the most quickly to get hold of his enemies' heads under his armpit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_380"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and dragging them along to bring them prisoners to his lord, that is the champion who is regarded, in the world, as the ablest hero--just as that surgeon who is able the most quickly to extract the dart, and allay the disease, is considered the most clever--just as the accountant who is able with the greatest speed to make his calculations, and with most rapidity to show the result, is considered the cleverest counter--just as the wrestler who is able the most quickly to lift his opponent up, and make him fall flat on his back, is considered the ablest hero--just so, N&acirc;gasena, it is that one of these two things--virtue and vice--which most quickly reaches its end that is, in the world, the more powerful of the two.'</P>
<P>'The Karma of both the two, O king, will be made evident in future births; but vice besides that will by reason of its guilt be made evident at once, and in this present life. The rulers (Kshatriyas)</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_150"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 150</FONT></A></P>
<P>of old, O king, established this decree: "Whosoever takes life shall be subject to a fine, and whosoever takes to himself what has not been given, and whosoever commits adultery,, and whosoever speaks lies, and whosoever is a dacoit, and whosoever is a highwayman, and whosoever cheats and swindles. Such men shall be liable to be fined or beaten or mutilated or broken&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_381"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or executed." And in pursuance thereof they held repeated enquiry, and then adjudged one or other punishment accordingly. But, O king, has there ever been by any one a decree promulgated: "Whosoever gives gifts, or observes a virtuous life, or keeps Uposatha, to him shall wealth be given, or honours?" And do they make continued enquiry, and bestow wealth or honours accordingly, as they do stripes or bonds upon a thief?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Well, if they did so then would virtue too be made evident even in this life. [<B>294</B>] But as they neither make such enquiry concerning givers, nor bestow wealth and honours upon them, therefore is virtue not manifested now. And this is the reason, O king, why vice is made known in this life, whereas he (the giver) receives the more abundantly in the lives to come. And therefore it is virtue which, through the destructions brought about by Karma, is by far the more powerful of the two&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_379"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">[DILEMMA THE SEVENTY-FOURTH.<BR>
OFFERINGS TO THE DEAD.]</P>
<P>29. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, these givers when they bestow their offerings, devote them specifically to former (relatives) now departed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_380"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, saying: "May this gift benefit such and such." Now do they (the dead) derive any benefit therefrom?'</P>
<P>'Some do, O king, and some do not.'</P>
<P>'Which then are they that do, and which do not?'</P>
<P>'Those who have been reborn in purgatory, O king, do not; nor those reborn in heaven; nor those reborn as animals. And of those reborn as Pretas three kinds do not-the Vant&acirc;sik&acirc; (who feed on vomit), the Khuppip&acirc;sino (who hunger and thirst.), the Ni<I>ggh</I>&acirc;ma-ta<I>n</I>hik&acirc; (who are consumed by thirst). But the Paradatt&ucirc;pa<I>g</I>&icirc;vino (who live on the gifts of others) they do derive profit, and those who bear them in remembrance do so too.'</P>
<P>'Then, N&acirc;gasena, offerings given by the givers have run to waste&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_384"></A><A HREF="#fn_381"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and are fruitless, since those</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A></P>
<P>for whose benefit they are given derive no profit therefrom.'</P>
<P>'No, O king. They run not to waste, neither are fruitless. The givers themselves derive profit from them.'</P>
<P>'Then convince me of this by a simile.'</P>
<P>'Suppose, O king, people were to get ready fish and meat and strong drinks and rice and cakes, and make a visit on a family related to them. If their relatives should not accept their complimentary present, would that present be wasted or fruitless?'</P>
<P>No, Sir, it would go to the owners of it.'</P>
<P>'Well, just so the givers themselves derive the profit. Or just, O king, [<B>295</B>] as if a man were to enter an inner chamber, and there were no exit in front of him, how would he get out?'</P>
<P>'By the way he entered.'</P>
<P>'Well, just so the givers themselves derive the profit.'</P>
<P>30. 'Let that pass, N&acirc;gasena. That is so, and I accept it as you say. We will not dispute your argument. But, venerable N&acirc;gasena, if the offerings made by such givers do advantage certain of the departed, and they do reap the result of the gifts, then if a man who destroys living creatures and drinks blood and is of cruel heart, were after committing murder or any other dreadful act, to dedicate it to the departed, saying: "May the result of this act of mine accrue to the departed"--would it then be transferred to them?'</P>
<P>'No, O king.'</P>
<P>'But what is the reason, what is the cause, that a good deed can accrue to them, and not an evil one?'</P>
<P><A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A></P>
<P>'This is really not a question you should ask, O king. Ask me no foolish question, O king, in the idea that an answer will be forthcoming. You will be asking me next why space is boundless, why the Ganges does not flow up stream, why men and birds are bipeds, and the animals quadrupeds!'</P>
<P>'It is not to annoy you that I ask this question, N&acirc;gasena, but for the sake of resolving a doubt. There are many people in the world who are left-handed or squint&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_385"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. I put that question to you, thinking: "Why should not also these unlucky ones have a chance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_386"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of bettering themselves?"'</P>
<P>'An evil deed, O king, cannot be shared with one who has not done it, and has not consented to it. People convey water long distances by an aqueduct. But could they in the same way remove a great mountain of solid rock?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Well, just in that way can a good deed be shared, but a bad one cannot. And one can light a lamp with oil, but could one in the same way, O king, light it with water?'</P>
<P>[<B>296</B>] 'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'Well, so is it that a good deed can be shared, but not an evil one. And husbandmen take water from a reservoir to bring their crops to maturity, but could they for the same purpose, O king, take water from the sea?'</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A></P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>
<P>'So again is it that though a good deed can be shared, an evil one cannot.'</P>
<P>31. 'But, venerable N&acirc;gasena, why is that? Convince me of this by a reason. I am not blind, or unobservant. I shall understand when I have heard.'</P>
<P>'Vice, O king, is a mean thing, virtue is great and grand. By its meanness vice affects&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_387"></A><A HREF="#fn_384"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> only the doer, but virtue by its grandeur overspreads the whole world of gods and men.'</P>
<P>'Show me this by a metaphor.'</P>
<P>'Were a tiny drop of water to fall on the ground, O king, would it flow on over ten leagues or twelve?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not. It would only have effect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_388"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on that very spot of ground on which it fell.'</P>
<P>'But why so?'</P>
<P>'Because o its minuteness.'</P>
<P>'Just so, O king, is vice minute. And by reason of its littleness it affects the doer only, and cannot possibly be shared. But if a mighty rain cloud were to pour out rain satisfying the surface of the earth, would that water spread round about?'</P>
<P>'Certainly, Sir. That thunderstorm would fill up the depressions in the ground and the pools and ponds, and the gullies and crevices and chasms, and the lakes and reservoirs and wells and lotus-tanks, and the water would spread abroad for ten leagues or for twelve&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_389"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A></P>
<P>'But why so, O king?'</P>
<P>'Because of the greatness of the storm.'</P>
<P>'Just so, O king, is virtue great. And by reason of its abundance it can be shared by gods and men.</P>
<P>'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, why is it that vice is so limited, [<B>297</B>] and virtue so much more wide-reaching?'</P>
<P>'Whosoever, O king, in this world gives gifts, and lives in righteousness, and keeps Uposatha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_390"></A><A HREF="#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he, glad, right glad, joyful, cheerful, happy, becomes filled with a sweet sense of trust and bliss, and bliss ruling in his heart his goodness grows still more and more abundantly. Like a deep pool of clear water, O king, and into which on one side the spring pours, while on the other the water flows away; so as it flows away it comes again, and there can be no failure there--so, O king, does his goodness grow more and more abundantly. If even through a hundred years, O king, a man were to keep on transferring&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_391"></A><A HREF="#fn_388"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to others (the merit of) any good he</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A></P>
<P>had done, the more he gave it away the more would his goodness grow, and he would still be able to share it with whomsoever he would. This, O king, is the reason why virtue is so much the greater of the two.</P>
<P>32. 'But on doing evil, O king, a man becomes filled with remorse&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_389"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the heart of him who feels remorse cannot get away (from the thought of the evil he has done), it is forcibly bent back on it, thrown back on it, obtains no peace&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_393"></A><A HREF="#fn_390"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; miserable, burning, abandoned of hope, he wastes away, and gaining no relief from depression&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_394"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, he is, as it were, possessed with his woe! just, O king, as a drop of water, falling on a dry river bed with its mighty sandbanks rising and falling in undulations along its crooked and shifty course, gains not in volume, but is swallowed up on the very spot where it fell, just so, O king, is a man, when he has done wrong, overcome with remorse, and the heart of him who feels remorse cannot get away from the thought of the evil he has done, it is forcibly bent back on it, thrown back on it, obtains no peace; miserable, burning, abandoned of hope, he wastes away, and gaining no release from his depression, he is, as it</P>

DREAMS.]</P>
<P>33. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, men and women in this world see dreams pleasant and evil, things they have seen before and things they have not, things they have done before and things they have not, [<B>298</B>] dreams peaceful and terrible, dreams of matters near to them and distant from them, full of many shapes and innumerable colours. What is this that men call a dream, and who is it who dreams it?'</P>
<P>'It is a suggestion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, O king, coming across the path of the mind which is what is called a dream. And there are six kinds of people who see dreams--the man who is of a windy humour&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, or of a bilious one, or of a phlegmatic one, the man who dreams&nbsp;dreams by the influence of a god, the man who does so by the influence of his own habits, and the man who does so in the way of prognostication&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. And</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A></P>
<P>of these, O king, only the last kind of dreams is true; all the rest are false.'</P>
<P>34. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, when a man dreams a dream that is a prognostication, how is it? Does his own mind set out itself to seek the omen, or does the prognostication come of its own accord into the path of his mind, or does some one else come and tell him of it?'</P>
<P>'His own mind does not itself seek the omen, neither does any one else come and tell him of it. The prognostication comes of its own accord into his mind. It is like the case of a looking-glass, which does not go anywhere to seek for the reflection; neither does any one else come and put the reflection on to the looking-glass. But the object reflected comes from somewhere or other across the sphere over which the reflecting power of the looking-glass extends.'</P>
<P>35. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, does the same mind which sees the dream also know: "Such and such a result, auspicious or terrible, will follow?"'</P>
<P>'No, that is not so, O king. After the omen has occurred he tells others, and then they explain the meaning of it.'</P>
<P>'Come, now, N&acirc;gasena, give me a simile to explain this.'</P>
<P>'It is like the marks, O king, and pimples, and cutaneous eruptions which arise on a man's body to his profit or loss, to his fame or dishonour, to his praise or blame, to his happiness or woe. [<B>299</B>] Do</P>
<P><A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A></P>
<P>in that case the pimples come because they know: "Such and such is the event which we shall bring about?"'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir. But according to the place on which the pimples have arisen, the fortune-tellers, making their observations, give decision, saying: Such and such will be the result."'</P>
<P>'Well, in the same way, O king, it is not the same mind which dreams the dream which also knows: "Such and such a result, conspicuous or terrible, will follow." But after the omen has occurred he tells others, and they then explain the meaning of it.'</P>
<P>36. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, when a man dreams a dream, is he awake or asleep?'</P>
<P>'Neither the one, O king; nor yet the other. But when his sleep has become light&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_395"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and he is not yet fully conscious&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_399"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, in that interval it is that dreams are dreamt. When a man is in deep sleep, O king, his mind has returned home (has entered again into the Bhava<U>n</U>ga)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_400"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and a mind thus shut in does not act, and a mind hindered in its action knows not the evil and the good, and he who knows not&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> has no dreams. It is when the mind is active that dreams are dreamt. just, O king, as in the darkness and gloom, where no light is, no shadow will fall even on the most burnished mirror, so when a man is in deep sleep his mind has returned into itself, and</P>
<P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A></P>
<P>a mind shut in does not act, and a mind inactive knows not the evil and the good, and he who knows not does not dream. For it is when the mind is active that dreams are dreamt. As the mirror, O king, are you to regard the body, as the darkness sleep, as the light the mind. Or again, O king, just as the glory of a sun veiled in fog is imperceptible, as its rays, though they do exist, are unable to pierce through, and as when its rays act not there is no light, so when a man is in deep sleep his mind has returned into itself, and a mind shut in does not act, and a mind inactive knows not the evil and the good, and he who knows not does not dream. For it is when the mind is active that dreams are dreamt. As the sun, O king, are you to regard the body, as the veil of fog sleep, [<B>300</B>] as the rays the mind.</P>
<P>37. 'Under two conditions, O king, is the mind inactive though the body is there--when a man being in deep sleep the mind has returned into itself, and when the man has fallen into a trance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_402"></A><A HREF="#fn_399"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The mind of a man who is awake, O king, is excited, open, clear, untrammelled, and no prognostication occurs to one whose mind is so. Just, O king, as men seeking concealment avoid the man who is open, candid, unoccupied, and unreserved,--just so is it that the divine intention is not manifested to the wakeful man, and the man who is awake therefore sees no dream. Or again, O king, just as the qualities which lead to wisdom are found not in that brother whose mode of livelihood and conduct are wrong, who is the friend of sinners, wicked, insolent, devoid</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A></P>
<P>of zeal,--just so is it that the divine intention is not manifested to the wakeful man, and the man who is awake, therefore, sees no dream.'</P>
<P>38. 'Venerable N&acirc;gasena, is there a beginning, a middle, and an end in sleep?'</P>
<P>'Yes, O king, there is.'</P>
<P>'Which then is the beginning, which the middle, and which the end?'</P>
<P>'The feeling of oppression and inability&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_400"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the body, O king, of weakness, slackness, inertness--that is the beginning of sleep. The light "monkey's sleep" in which a man still guards his scattered thoughts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_401"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>--that is the middle of sleep. When the mind has entered into itself--that is the end of sleep. And it is in the middle stage, O king, in the "monkey's sleep" that dreams are dreamt. Just, O king, as when a man self-restrained with collected thoughts, stedfast in the faith, unshaken in wisdom, plunges deep into the woods far from the sound of strife, and thinks over some subtle matter, he there, tranquil and at peace, will master the meaning of it--just so a man still watchful, not fallen into sleep, but dozing in a "monkey's sleep," will dream a dream. [<B>301</B>] As the sound of strife, so, O king, are you to regard wakefulness, and as the lonely wood the "monkey's sleep." And as that man avoiding the sound of strife, keeping out of sleep, remaining in the middle stage, will master the meaning of that subtle matter, so the still watchful man, not fallen into sleep, but dozing in a "monkey's sleep," will dream a dream.'</P>

<P>'And again, O king, some woman or some man of believing heart, able, intelligent, wise, endowed with insight, may deliberately take perfumes, or a garland, or a cloth, and place it on the Ketiya, making the resolve: "May such and such a wonder take place!"

But what is the reason why an infant, one under seven years of age, should not, even though he regulate his life aright, attain to insight? Therein there is still a puzzle left. For is it not admitted that in a child there is not passion, neither malice, nor dullness, nor pride, nor heresy, nor discontent, nor lustful thoughts? Being undefiled by sin, that which we call an infant is fit and ready (to the attainment</P>

<P>'The following is the reason, O king, for my saying [<B>311</B>] that an infant, even though he regulate his life aright, cannot attain to insight. If, O king, one under seven years of age could feel passion about things exciting to passion, could go wrong in things leading to iniquity, could be befooled in matters that mislead, could be maddened as to things that infatuate, could understand a heresy, could distinguish between content and discontent, could think out virtue and vice, then might insight be possible to him. But the mind of one under seven years of age, O king, is powerless and weak, mean, small, slight, obscure, and dull, whereas the essential principle of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a is transcendental, important, weighty, wide-reaching, and extensive. Therefore is it, O king, that the infant, with so imperfect a mind, is unable to grasp an idea so great. It is like the case of Sineru, O king, the king of the mountains, heavy and ponderous, wide-reaching and mighty as it is,--could now a man, by his ordinary strength and power and energy, root that mountain up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?'</P>
<P>'Certainly not, Sir.'</P>

But all those who are joyful and happy in the world take delight in, are devoted to, the five pleasures of sense--they practise and delight their eyes in many kinds of pleasurable forms, such as at any time they like the best--they practise and delight their ears in many kinds of pleasurable sounds of revelry and song, such as at any time they like the best--they practise and delight their sense of smell with many kinds of perfumes of flowers, and fruits, and leaves, and bark, and roots, and sap, such as at any time they like the best--they practise and delight their tongue with many kinds of pleasurable tastes of hard foods and of soft, of syrups, drinks, and beverages, such as at any time they like the best--they practise and delight their sense of touch with many kinds of pleasurable feelings, tender and delicate, exquisite and soft, such as at any time they like the best--they practise and delight their minds with many sorts of conceptions and ideas, pure and impure, good and bad, such as at any time they like the best.

<P>59. 'Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, O king, has no pain in it. It is bliss unalloyed. When you, O king, maintain that Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a is painful, that which you call "painful" is not Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a. It is the preliminary stage to the realisation of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, it is the process of seeking after Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a. Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a itself is bliss pure and simple, there is no pain mixed with it. And I will give you an explanation of this. Is there such a thing, O king, as the bliss of sovranty which kings enjoy?'</P>
<P>'Most certainly.'</P>
<P>'And is there no pain, O king, mingled with that bliss?'</P>
<P>'No, Sir.'</P>

<P>'That, venerable N&acirc;gasena, is not what is called the bliss of sovranty. It is only the preliminary stage in the pursuit of that bliss. It is after they have thus, in pain, sought after sovranty, that they enjoy the bliss thereof.

<P>'Just so, O king, is Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a all bliss, and there is no pain mingled with it. Those who are in quest of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a afflict their minds and bodies it is true, restrain themselves in standing, walking, sitting, lying, and in food, suppress their sleep, keep their senses in subjection, abandon their very body and their life.

<P>'Well, is that bliss of knowledge alloyed with pain?'</P>
<P>'No.'</P>
<P>'What then, O king, is the good of their afflicting</P>

<P>'That, N&acirc;gasena, is not the bliss of knowledge, it is a preliminary stage in the pursuit thereof. It is after the teachers have, in pain, sought after knowledge, that they enjoy its bliss. Thus is it, N&acirc;gasena, that the bliss of knowledge is unalloyed with pain. For that bliss of knowledge is one thing, and the pain another.'</P>

It was an idea that was common ground to our Buddhist apologist, and to the Brahman opponents whom he always has in view, that there were certain people to whom gifts ought to be given, and the being worthy was one of the conditions precedent to belonging to this class. Of course the <A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A> Brahmans held that to be a Brahman was another condition, but the Buddhist, who inherited the idea from them, had discarded this part of the conception.

<P><A NAME="fn_314"></A><A HREF="sbe3606.htm#fr_316">127:1</A> <I>K</I>andima-suriye. We should say 'the sun and the moon,' and I cannot think the difference of phraseology is entirely without significance. While the Brahmans put their own caste and order first, the Buddhist texts talk of 'Samanas and Brahmans,' 'Khattiyas and Brahmans.' This has, and no doubt rightly, been held significant of the opinion of the authors. Why should the fact of their always referring, in similar compounds, to the moon before the sun, and to women before men, be less so? Now it is almost always taken for granted that the Buddhists were reformers, as opposed to the Brahmans, who wanted to run still in the ancient grooves. But there is another side of the question that has been entirely overlooked. There is ample evidence in their literature that (at least in certain directions, more especially of religious thought) the Brahmans had been constantly progressive, and their Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as are really the result of reform following on reform. To use a parallel drawn from modern politics, Buddhists are to Brahmans much more like Socialists to Liberals than like Liberals to Conservatives. The Brahmans had worked out in their minds no new complete system, and when they reformed they left the roots of the old order of things in the ground. But in the momentous change from matriarchate to patriarchate they threw all their power and influence on the side of the newer conception. And when, like Kronos to Jupiter, the old gods gave place to the new, it was they who worked out the newer set of ideas--more especially heaven or sun-worship as against moon-worship and all that it involved. We must not forget that a change of dynasty, or of precedence, among the gods was of more importance to men in those times than a change of dynasty among earthly kings. And though the Buddhists it is true, as we ourselves now, cared for none of these things, and were busied with other discussions than the precedence of the sun and moon, they quite quietly and naturally, when they had to choose, adopted the form of words which did not imply an acceptance of the Brahman position, whose system in other matters they were trying, if not to storm, at least to turn.</P>
<P>We are here in the midst of questions too vast to be discussed with profit in a note. But Buddhism certainly arose among those sections of the community least influenced by the reforms the Brahmans supported. And there is evidence, in the precedence the <A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A> Buddhists gave to women and to the moon, that the older ideas had not, even then, died out.</P>

I am told that these so-called flowers are not flowers at all, botanically speaking, but young shoots. But it is one of the most beautiful sights in a Ceylon landscape to see this splendid forest tree, lofty and wide-spreading as it is, one mass of what look like red blossoms from crown to root. For at the 'bloom time' it casts all its green leaves, and has the appearance of a scarlet bell. No wonder that this was thought supernatural, and that the tree should be called the N&acirc;ga tree. Its timber is so valuable that in Anglo-Indian the tree is called the 'Iron-wood' tree. But it may be regretted that the commercial spirit of the European has substituted this hard name for the 'Fairy tree' of the native languages.</P>

Now the Bodisat theory has never been thoroughly worked out in detail. It is clear from the statements given in pp. 38-58 of my 'Buddhist Birth Stories' that the Bodisat who became Gotama the Buddha was held to have been in existence throughout the whole period in which the former twenty-four Buddhas appeared, and this is probably the 'period' intended. H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;'s version (p. 421) is as ambiguous as the P&acirc;li. Spence Hardy gives at p. 87 of his 'Manual of Buddhism' what purports to be a translation of our passage. But it is only a loose paraphrase, and he interprets this 'period-difference' as simply <A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A> identical with the next one in the list, the 'length-of-life-difference'--which must be wrong.</P>
<P>It must be remembered that the Bodisats referred to throughout this dilemma are exclusively men--not those mentioned in the <I>G</I>&acirc;takas (who are all Bodisats of the historical Buddha), but only those Bodisats who became Buddhas in the same life--that is, the Buddhas themselves before they reached Buddhahood.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_330"></A><A HREF="sbe3606.htm#fr_333">133:1</A> &Acirc;yu-vemattat&acirc;. This may be due to either of two causes--in the first place they may be born as creatures whose allotted period of life varies. Thus the Bodisat was twenty times Sakka, the king of the gods; and his life would then have lasted hundreds of thousands of years. But he was 106 times an animal of some kind, and then his life would have been of course much shorter. Again, in his births as a man (more than 350 times, see the table in my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. ci), the average duration of men's lives will have varied, according to Buddhist theory, from many centuries down to only a few years. It is in this second sense only that (with H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;) we must suppose the phrase &acirc;yu-vemattat&acirc; to be used--thus excluding all the Bodisats except such as were men. But in the <I>G</I>&acirc;taka stories the average age of man is (with one or two exceptions) normal.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_331"></A><A HREF="sbe3606.htm#fr_334">133:2</A> Pam&acirc;<I>n</I>a-vemattat&acirc;, which we must also understand to refer only to the varying average size of mankind, which, according to Buddhist theory, is very great at the commencement, and very small at the close, of a Kalpa. For it is only the men-Bodisats, and only in each series the last man-Bodisat (just before he became 'Buddha'), concerning whom this question of penance could arise.</P>

They are the confidence that no one--Sama<I>n</I>a or Brahman, God or M&acirc;ra--can reprove him by saying: (1) 'The qualities which you maintain to be those of a Buddha have not been attained by you;' or (2) 'The Great Evils which you maintain to have ceased in an Arahat have not ceased in you;' or (3) 'The qualities which you say are dangerous (in the higher life) are not really dangerous to one who practises them;' or (4) 'The aim which you held before others in preaching your Dhamma will not lead him who follows it to the destruction of sorrow.' The list will be found in the A<U>n</U>guttara Nik&acirc;ya IV, 8 (where it is probably a quotation from one of the conversational Suttas). But the punctuation in Dr. Morris's edition should be corrected by putting full stops after each vihar&acirc;mi. Childers gives a different explanation under ves&acirc;ra<I>gg</I>a, but his interpretation must be altered to that here given, which is the only correct one.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_334"></A><A HREF="sbe3606.htm#fr_337">134:2</A> These have not been found in any Pi<I>t</I>aka text, but Burnouf gives them in a note to the 'Lotus de la Bonne Loi' (p. 781) from the <I>G</I>in&acirc;la<U>n</U>k&acirc;ra. He says the expression dasabalo is found as applied to the Buddha '&agrave; chaque instant dans les textes,' but this is not the case, so far at least as the older texts are concerned. In one of the old verses preserved at the Mah&acirc;vagga I, 22, 13, and quoted in the <I>G</I>&acirc;taka (vol. i, p. 84), dasabalo occurs as an epithet of the Buddha, but among the numerous epithets applied in the Buddhavamsa to the various Buddhas the term does not occur, nor have I been able to find it in the published portions of any of the great Nik&acirc;yas. (Ten N&acirc;ga-balas are ascribed to the Buddha in Buddhavamsa, p. 39, but these seem to be different.) Buddha-rakkhita, the author of the <I>G</I>in&acirc;la<U>n</U>k&acirc;ra, probably lived at about the eleventh or twelfth century A.D., and Hardy's paraphrase of his interpretations (in the 'Manual of Buddhism,' pp. 380, 381) is throughout inaccurate. As therefore it is precisely the growth of ideas about the Buddha that is of prime importance in the history of Buddhism, I give here Buddha-rakkhita's explanation, adding the Sanskrit names as given in the Mah&acirc;vyutpatti, &#167; 8:--</P></FONT>

It is noteworthy that this famous word, which plays so great a part in the later philosophies, and which is often supposed <A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A> to express a fundamental conception of the Buddhists, has not yet been traced, and will probably never be found, in the Pi<I>t</I>akas, in any other than this subordinate and purely ethical sense. So when Mr. Gough in his 'Philosophy of the Upanishads' says, p. 186, that 'pessimism, metempsychosis, and m&acirc;y&acirc; (the primitive world fiction) are retained in Buddhism' he is as wrong about m&acirc;y&acirc; as he is about metempsychosis. He is evidently still under the delusion that Buddhism teaches the transmigration of souls, and that it has inherited from such schoolmen as <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kar&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya the theory of the m&acirc;y&acirc;. This is as funny as the astounding blindness which makes him say (pp. 267, 268) 'there is no quest of verity of an active law of righteousness (in Buddhism), but only a yearning after a lapse into the void'(!). The converse proposition would be nearer to the actual fact, and the Buddhist Avi<I>gg</I>&acirc; is quite different from the M&acirc;y&acirc; of the later Ved&acirc;ntists. How absolutely different is the world in which the thoughts of a Buddhist would move is shown by H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc;'s gloss: 'The m&acirc;y&acirc; of concealing faults one has' (tam&acirc;ge &#156;ti agu<I>n</I>a sa<I>m</I>gawana m&acirc;y&acirc;).</P>

But throughout this discussion there is an underlying reference to a very beautiful Buddhist conception that a man can transfer to others the merit of any good deed he has done. Thus at the end of a palm-leaf manuscript the copyist often adds the pious wish: 'May the merit of my having made this copy redound to the advantage of all men,' or words to that effect. And the preceding metaphor would seem to show that this must be the secondary sense here attached to I causing to bend towards;'--the more he <A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A> spends (as it were) his virtue, the more remains, just as however much the water flows away from the spring, still quite as much remains, and he can still share with others that which is left.

<P>Though I had pointed this out already in 1876 the animistic interpretation of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a is still the prevalent one, and still continues to lead to endless confusion. Why is it then, the reader may ask, that our author does not contradict the Christian interpretation of the Buddhist summum bonum in so many words? Simply because it never occurred to him as possible. It was probably even as inconceivable to him as the Buddhist interpretation of it seems to be to most Western writers.</P>

The translation is difficult. In our passage here H&icirc;na<I>t</I>i-kumbur&ecirc; (p. 464) renders it, as applied both to space and to Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, by 'having no &acirc;<I>s</I>rawa.'

It is literally 'break this dart of guilt within.' The meaning is clear enough (except as to whether the guilt is the speaker's or 'this people's'). To break a dart in a wound would be no kindness, and that cannot have been the author's idea.
