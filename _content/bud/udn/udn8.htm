<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of An&acirc;thapindika.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time the Blessed One was instructing, arousing, animating and gladdening the Bhikkhus with a religious discourse on the subject of Nirvana.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these Bhikkhus grasping the meaning, thinking it out and accepting with their hearts the whole doctrine, listened attentively.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed one, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is, O Bhikkhus, a state where there is neither earth, nor water, nor heat nor air, neither infinity of space, nor infinity of consciousness, nor nothingness, nor perception, nor non-perception, neither this world nor that world, both sun und moon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, O Bhikkhus, I term neither coming nor going, nor standing, neither death nor birth. It is without stability, without procession, without a basis: that is the end of sorrow".</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_5"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>5</FONT>. Thus have I heard. At that time the Blessed One

<A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A>

in company with the Brotherhood, passing through the Malla country, arrived at P&acirc;v&acirc;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One tarried at P&acirc;v&acirc;, in the mango grove of Cunda, the potter's son.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cunda, the potter's son, heard that the Blessed One, on his way through the Malla country, had arrived at P&acirc;v&acirc;, and was staying in his mango grove.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cunda, the potter's son, went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart, and the Blessed One instructed, aroused, animated and gladdened, with religious discourse, Cunda, the potter's son.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cunda, the potter's son, instructed, aroused, animated and gladdened by the religious discourse of the Blessed One said: "May it please the Blessed One and the Brotherhood to take their morrow's meal with me".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One assented by his silence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cunda, the potter's son, perceiving that the Blessed One had assented, arose from his seat and saluted the Blessed One, and passing round keeping his right side to him, departed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cunda, the potter's son, at the end of that night having prepared in his own house sweet food, both hard and soft and a quantity of <I>S&ucirc;karamaddava</I>,<A NAME="page_113_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_113_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> announced to the Blessed One: "Sire, the time is come, the meal is ready."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, robing himself in the forenoon, and taking his alms-bowl and tunic, went together with

<!------------------------page 114------------------------>

<A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A>

the Brotherhood, to the house of Cunda, the potter's son and when he arrived there, sat down on the appointed seat. And while thus seated he called Cunda, the potter's son, to him and said: "The <I>S&ucirc;karamaddava</I> you have prepared, Cunda, give to me and the other food, soft and hard, present to the Brethren."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so, Sire," said Cunda, the potter's son, in assent to the Blessed One, and he gave the <I>S&ucirc;karamaddava</I> which he had prepared, to the Blessed One, and the other food, both hard and soft, to the Brethren.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One called Cunda, the potter's son, to him and said: "Bury, Cunda, what remains of the <I>S&ucirc;karamaddava</I> in a hole in the ground, for there is no one I know of in the worlds of M&acirc;ra or Brahma, or amongst the Samanas or Brahmanas, or in the world of gods and men who can assimilate such food, except the Perfect One."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so, Sire"; said Cunda, the potter's son, in assent to the Blessed One, and having buried what remained of the <I>S&ucirc;karamaddava</I> in a hole, he went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near, he saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One having instructed, aroused, animated and gladdened Cunda, the potter's son, with religious discourse, arose from his seat and departed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One after partaking of the food provided by Cunda, the potter's son, was seized with a severe malady, and dire pains followed by hemorrhage, even unto death, came upon him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the Blessed One, ever mindful and intent, endured the pains without a murmur.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One called the venerable Ananda to

<!------------------------page 115------------------------>

<A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A>

him and said: "Let us go, Ananda; we will proceed to Kusin&acirc;ra."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so, Sire;" said the venerable Ananda in assent to the Blessed One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thus have I heard. He took of the food of Cunda, the the potter's son:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fortitude he bore the grievous, deadly pains:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the master partaok of the S&ucirc;karamaddava,</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe sickness came upon him:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After relief, the Blessed One said: 'I will set out for the city of Kusin&acirc;ra'."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, leaving the road, went and sat down at the foat of a tree, and calling the venerable Ananda to him, he said: "I pray thee, Ananda, make ready the four-fold cloth, I am weary and would sit down. And the Blessed One sat down on the appointed seat, and thus sitting he called the venerable Ananda to him and said: "I pray thee, Ananda, bring me some water, I am thirsty and would drink, Ananda."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these words had been spoken the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "Just now, Sire, about 500 wagons have passed over, and the shallow water, disturbed by the wheels, flows turbid and muddy. There is, Sire, not far off, the Kukuttha stream, whose waters are clear, refreshing, cool, pellucid, full to the brim and lovely. There the Blessed One may drink of the waters and cool his limbs."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second time the Blessed One called the venerable Ananda to him and said: "Bring me, I pray thee, Ananda, some water, I am thirsty and would drink, Ananda."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second time the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "Just now, Sire, some 500 wagons have passed over, and

<!------------------------page 116------------------------>

<A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A>

the shallow water, disturbed by the wheels, flows turbid and muddy. There is, Sire, not far off the Kukuttha stream whose waters are clear, refreshing, cool, pellucid, full to the brim and lovely. There the Blessed One may drink and cool his limbs."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third time the Blessed One called the venerable Ananda to him and said: "Bring me, Ananda, I pray thee, some water: I am thirsty and would drink, Ananda."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so, Sire"; said the venerable Ananda in assent to the Blessed One and taking his bowl he went to the river.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that river, whose shallow waters had been disturbed by the wheels and become a turbid and muddy stream, on the arrival of Ananda, was flowing clear, lucent and untainted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ananda thought: "How strange, how astonishing is the great strength and mighty power of the Perfect One! This stream, whose shallow waters disturbed by the wheels were muddy and polluted, on my arrival, flows pure, lucent and untainted"; and filling his bowl with water he went to where the Blessed One was, and drawing near, said: "How strange, Sire, how astonishing is the great strength and mighty power of the Perfect One! This stream, whose waters etc. [as above] is now pure, lucent and untainted. Drink, O Exalted One, of the water, drink, O Happy One, of the water."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One drank of the water.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One with a great company of the brethren went to the Kukuttha stream, and when he arrived there, he entered the stream and bathed and drank; and when he had come out, he repaired to the Mango-grove and calling the venerable Cundaka to him, said: "I pray thee, Cundaka,

<!------------------------page 117------------------------>

<A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A>

spread out for me the four-fold cloth, I am weary, Cundaka, and would lay me down."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so, Sire"; said the venerable Cundaka in assent to the Blessed One and he spread out the four-fold cloth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One lay down on his right side, as a lion does, placing one foot upon the other, mindful and consious, and dwelling upon the thought of arising.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the venerable Cundaka sat there in front of the Exalted One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the pure, joy-giving, pellucid river Kukuttha went the Buddha;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erweary, the Master, the Perfect One, the Unequalled in this world, plunged into the stream:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master bathed and drank of the waters;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crossed over preceding the throng of disciples.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master, the Exalted One, who set forth the Doctrine, went to the Mango-grove.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke to Cunda, the monk: 'Spread out for me the four-fold cloth.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cunda heeded the Holy One, he spread out at once the four-fold cloth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master, the weary One, laid himself down;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cunda sat there beside him."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One called the venerable Ananda to him and said: "It may happen, Ananda, that some one may cause Cunda, the potter's son to suffer remorse by saying: 'It is a loss to you, brother Cunda, it is a disadvantage to you, brother Cunda, that the Perfect One should pass away from existence, having received his last meal at you hands.' Any remorse of this kind that may arise in Cunda, the potter's son, should be removed in this

<!------------------------page 118------------------------>

<A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A>

wise: 'It is a gain, brother Cunda, it is an advantage to you, brother Cunda, that the Perfect One should pass away from existence, having received his last meal at your hands. Thus have I heard, brother Cunda, in his very presence, these words have I received from the very mouth of the Blessed One: 'there are two alms of the highest profit, of the greatest advantage to me, exceeding all other alms, more fruitful, more replete with result. What are these two? The alms-food of which the Perfect One partook when he awakened to supreme enlightenment, and the alms-food of which he partook, when he was about to pass away from existence, in that utter passing away in which 'attachment' is extinct. These are the two alms, the most perfect in result, the most complete in their consequence, exceeding all other alms, greater in profit, greater in fruition. The venerable Cunda, the potter's son, has laid up Karma, conducing to length of life, to praise, to heaven, to fame, and to that influence which induces men to follow virtue. Any remorse, Ananda, that may arise in Cunda, the potter's son, should thus be removed'."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_6"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>6</FONT>. Thus have I heard. At that time the Blessed One, in company with a number of the brethren, wandering through the Magadha country, arrived at P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma.</P>

<P>

<!------------------------page 119------------------------>

<A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lay-disciples of P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma heard the report that the Blessed One, in company with a number of the brethren, after wandering through the Magadha county had repaired to P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lay-disciples of P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near they saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart, and while thus sitting the lay-disciples of P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma said to the Blessed One: "May it please the Blessed One to come to our house."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One assented by his silence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lay-disciples of P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma perceiving that the Blessed One had assented, they arose from their seats and saluted the Blessed One, and passing round with their right sides to him, they returned to their rest-house. And when they arrived there, they set the house in order, arranging the seats, providing water vessels, and putting up oil-lamps. And when they had done this, they went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near, they saluted the Blessed One and stood respectfully apart, and while thus standing the lay-disciples of P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma said to the Blessed One: "Sire, the rest-house is set in order, the seats are arranged, the water vessels provided and the oil-lamps put up. May the Blessed One now do as he pleases."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, robing himself in the forenoon and taking his alms-bowl and tunic, went, together with the Brethren, to the rest-house. And when the Blessed One arrived there, having washed his feet, he entered the rest-house and sat down near the centre pillar, facing the East, and the Brethren, also, having washed their feet, entered the rest-house and sat down near the centre wall, facing the East, the Blessed One being in front of them;

<!------------------------page 120------------------------>

<A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A>

and the lay-disciples of P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma, having washed their feet, entered the rest-house and sat down near the Eastern wall with their faces to the West, the Blessed One in front of them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One thus addressed the lay-disciples of P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five losses, O housholders, result to the wrong-doer through his want of rectitude. What are these five?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In this world, O housholders, the wrong-doer failing in rectitude, in consequence of sloth, suffers great loss of property. This is the first loss to the wrong-doer through want of rectitude.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Further, O housholders, in the case of the wrong-doer, who fails in virtue, an evil repute arises. This is the second loss to the wrong-doer who fails in virtue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Further, O housholders, whenever a wrong-doer, failing in virtue, approaches assemblies, whether of Khattiyas, or Brahmanas, or lay men, or Samanas, he feels ashamed and troubled in their presence. This is the third loss to a wrong-doer who fails in virtue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Further, O housholders, the wrong-doer who fails in virtue, dies in a state of unrest. This is the fourth loss to a wrong-doer who fails in virtue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Further, O housholders, the wrong-doer, wanting in rectitude, on the dissolution of the body, after death, is born into a state of punishment, of suffering, of torment, in hell. This is the fifth loss to a wrong-doer through want of rectitude.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, O housholders, are the five losses to the wrong-doer, through want of rectitude.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five gains, O housholders, to the virtuous

<!------------------------page 121------------------------>

<A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A>

man, through the practise of virtue. What are these five?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In this world, O housholders, the upright man who practises virtue, by means of diligence acquires abundant possessions. This is the first gain to an upright man who practises virtue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Further, O housholders, in the case of an upright man who practises virtue, there arises a fair repute. This is the second gain to an upright man who practises virtue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Further, O housholders, whenever an upright man who practises virtue, approaches assemblies whether of Khattiyas, or Brahmanas, or laymen, or Samanas, he is not ashamed or troubled when he approaches them. This is the third gain to the upright man who practises virtue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Further, O housholders, the upright man who practises virtue, dies peacefully. This is the fourth gain to an upright man, who practises virtue.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Further, O housholders, the upright man who practises virtue, on the dissolution of the body after death, is born into a state of happiness, in heaven. This is the fifth gain to an upright man who practises virtue. These, O housholders, are the five gains to the upright man who practises virtue."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One having instructed, aroused, animated and gladdened the lay-disciples with this religious discourse, dismissed them, saying: "The night, O housholders, is far spent. Do now as seemeth fit to you."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lay-disciples of P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma, having praised the words of the Blessed One, and given thanks, arose from their seats, and passing round keeping their right sides to him, took their departure.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, soon after the departure of the

<!------------------------page 122------------------------>

<A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A>

lay-disciples of P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma, entered his private apartments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time the Sun&icirc;dhavassak&acirc;ras, the ministers of Magadha, had built a fortress at P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma, to repel the Vajjis. And at that time also, a great number, some thousands of Devas, haunted the dwellings at P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma. Wherever the most powerful Devas haunted the houses, in that place they induced the most powerful kings and king's ministers to build dwelling places. Wherever the lesser Devas haunted the houses, there they induced the lesser kings and king's ministers to build dwelling places, and wherever the lowest Devas haunted the houses, there they induced the lowest kings and king's Ministers to build dwelling places.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, with his divine, clear sight, surpassing that of men, beheld these thousands of Devas who haunted the houses at P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma, and wherever the most powerful Devas, etc. [as above. <I>Transl</I>.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, in the dawn following that night, called the venerable Ananda to him and said: "Who, Ananda, built this fortress at P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma"?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sun&icirc;dhavassak&acirc;ras, the ministers of Magadha, built this fortress at P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma, to repel the Vajjis."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems, Ananda, as if the Sun&icirc;dhavassak&acirc;ras, the Ministers of Magadha, after consulting with the Tavatimsa gods, had thus, Ananda, built this fortress at P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma, to repel the Vajjis. I have just seen, Ananda, with my divine and clear sight, surpassing that of men, this large number of thousands of Devas who haunt the houses at P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma. Wherever the most powerful Devas etc. [as above. <I>Transl</I>.].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever, Ananda, famous places, centres of trade may

<!------------------------page 123------------------------>

<A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A>

be, this fortified city will be chief among them, an emporium of commerce. But, Ananda, three disasters will befall P&acirc;t&acirc;lig&acirc;ma, by fire and water and internal dissensions."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Sun&icirc;dhivassak&acirc;ras, the ministers of Magadha went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near they exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One, and when they had exchanged with him the compliments of friendship and civility, they stationed themselves respectfully apart, and while thus standing the Sun&icirc;dhavassak&acirc;ras, the ministers of Magadha said to the Blessed One: "May it please the Lord Gotama, and the Brethren to take their meal with us to-day."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blessed One assented by his silence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Sun&icirc;dhavassak&acirc;ras, the ministers of M&acirc;gadha, perceiving that the Blessed One had assented, went to their own house, and when they arrived there, gave orders for the preparation of sweet food, both hard and soft, and they announced to the Blessed One, that the time had come; "Lord Gotama, the time is come, the meal is ready."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, robing himself in the forenoon and taking his alms-bowl and tunic, went, in company with the Brethren, to the house of the Sun&icirc;dhavassak&acirc;ras; and when they arrived there, they sat down on the appointed seats.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Sun&icirc;dhivassak&acirc;ras, with their own hands, served and offered sweet food, both hard and soft, to the Brethren with the Buddha at their head.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the Blessed One had withdrawn his hand from the bowl and finished his meal, the Sun&icirc;dhivassak&acirc;ras having taken a lower place, sat down apart, and the Blessed One, as they sat thus, gladdened the Sun&icirc;dhivassak&acirc;ras with these verses:</P>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, when he had gladdened the Sun&icirc;dhavassak&acirc;ras with these verses, arose from his seat and departed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time the Sun&icirc;dhivassak&acirc;ras followed the Blessed One, step by step, saying: "The gate by which the Samana Gotama this day departs, shall be called the Gotama gate, the ford by which he crosses the Ganga river, shall be called the Gotama ford.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gate, by which the Blessed One passed out was called the Gotama gate.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One came to where the river Ganga was. Now at that time, the river was full, up to the bank, so that a crow could have drunk from it. Some men, eager to cross, were in search of a boat, some in search of a raft, others were engaged in constructing a raft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, just as if a strong man should out-stretch his bent arm or bend back his out-stretched arm, even so he vanished from the hither bank of the river Ganga and stood upon the opposite bank with the Brethren.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One beheld those men, eager to cross,

some in search of a boat, some in search of a raft, and others engaged in constructing a raft.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the venerable N&acirc;gasam&acirc;la observed on the way that the road diverged, and seeing this, he said to the Blessed One; "Sire, this is the way, let us go in this direction."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these words had been spoken, the Blessed One said to the venerable N&acirc;gasam&acirc;la: "This is the way, N&acirc;gasam&acirc;la, let us go in this direction."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Repetition of speech and reply. <I>Transl</I>.].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third time the venerable N&acirc;gasam&acirc;la said to the Blessed One: "This, Sire, is the way, let us go in this direction." And the venerable N&acirc;gasam&acirc;la threw down on the ground the bowl and tunic of the Blessed One, saying: "There, Sire, are your bowl and tunic."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the venerable N&acirc;gasam&acirc;la proceeded on the road, robbers came and assaulted him with their hands and feet, broke his alms-bowl and tore his garments. And the venerable N&acirc;gasam&acirc;la, with broken bowl and torn garments

went to where the Blessed One was, and drawing near he saluted the Blessed One and sat down respectfully apart and while thus sitting he said to the Blessed One: "Just now, Sire, as I was proceeding on the road, robbers came and assaulted me with their hands and feet, broke my alms-bowl and tore my garments."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time, the dearly loved grandson of Vis&acirc;kha-mig&acirc;ram&acirc;ta died.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vis&acirc;kha-mig&acirc;ram&acirc;ta went at unseasonable hours, with hands and hair wet (with tears)<A NAME="page_126_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_126_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>, to where the Blessed One was and drawing near she saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sire, my dearly loved grandson is dead; that is why I come here, at unseasonable hours, with hands and hair wet (with tears)."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you find, O Vis&acirc;kha, that there are sons and grandsons

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I find, Blessed One, that there are sons and grandsons in proportion to the number of men."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And how many men of Savatthi, Vis&acirc;kha, die daily?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes, Sire, ten men of Savatthi die daily, sometimes nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two; sometimes, Sire, only one man dies in the day. Of men dying in Savatthi, there is no lack, Sire."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What think you, Vis&acirc;kha; have you found at any time or anywhere, men whose garments have been unwetted (by tears), whose hair has been unwetted (by tears)?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the venerable Dubba Mallaputta went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near he saluted the Blessed One and sat down respectfully apart, and while thus sitting he said to the Blessed One: "The time, O Happy One, for my passing away from existence has come."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do, O Dubba, as seemeth right."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the venerable Dubba Mallaputta, got up from his seat and saluted the Blessed One and having passed round keeping his right side to him, he rose into the air, sitting cross-legged in the firmament, and when he had attained to that state of mystic meditation induced by fixed attention on one predominant idea (in this case that of fire), he rose still higher and finally passed into Nirvana.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the venerable Dubba Mallaputta had thus risen into the air; sitting cross-legged in the firmament, and attaining to that state of mystic meditation induced by fixed attention on one predominant idea (in this case, that of fire) and rising still higher passed into Nirvana, of his body which was burnt and consumed by flames, there was no residue either of ashes or soot to be seen.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of butter or oil when they are burnt and consumed by flames, there is no residue either of ashes or soot, so was it with the venerable Dubba Mallaputta, when his body was burnt and consumed by fire, there was no residue of ashes or soot to be seen, after he had risen into the air and sat cross-legged in the firmament, having attained to that state of mystic meditation induced by fixed attention on one predominant idea (that of fire) and when arising still higher passed into Nirvana.</P>
