## CHAPTER VI.

### Jaccandha.

 

   <span id="pp_1"></span>1. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Vesali, in the Mahavana, in the Pagoda Hall.

   And the Blessed One, having robed himself in the forenoon, and taking
his alms-bowl and tunic entered Vesali for alms. And when he had
returned from his rounds and finished his meal, he called the venerable
Ananda to him and said: "Take up, Ananda, the mat, I will pass the heat
of the day at the Câpâla shrine."

   "Be it so, Sire" said the venerable Ananda in assent to the Blessed
One, and taking up the mat, he followed the Blessed One step by step.

   And the Blessed One went to where the Câpâla shrine was, and drawing
near, he sat down on the appointed seat, and while thus sitting he
called the venerable Ananda to him and said: "Delightful, Ananda, is the
Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine, delightful is the
Bahuputta shrine, delightful is the Sarandada shrine, delightful is the
Câpâla shrine! Whoever, Ananda, has dwelt upon, enlarged, made use of as
a vehicle, objectified, taken as a foundation, amalgamated, and most
thoroughly striven with the constituents of magic power, if he should so
wish, is able to remain in this world a Kalpa,<span
id="page_87_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_87_note_1) or the remainder of a
<span id="page_88">p. 88</span> Kalpa. The Perfect One, Ananda, has
dwelt upon, enlarged, made use of as a vehicle, objectified, taken as a
foundation, amalgamated, and most thoroughly striven with the
constituents of magic power, and if he so wish, can remain in this world
a Kalpa, or the remainder of a Kalpa."

   And the venerable Ananda failing to penetrate the meaning of the
palpable sign made and the clear hint given by the Blessed One, did not
beseech the Blessed One and say: "May it please the Blessed One to
remain in this world a Kalpa, may it please the Happy One to remain a
Kalpa for the welfare of many, for the happiness of many, in compassion
for the people, for the benefit, the advantage, the delight of men and
gods--so possessed was the heart of Ananda by the Wicked One.

   A second time the Blessed One called the venerable Ananda to him and
said etc. (repetition as above. *Transl*.\].

   A third time etc. \[repetition as above *Transl*.\]

   And the Blessed One called the venerable Ananda to him and said: "Go
now, Ananda, and do as you like."

   "Be it so, Sire," said the venerable Ananda in assent to the Blessed
One and rising from his seat, he saluted the Blessed One, and passing
round keeping his right side to him, he went and sat down, not far off,
at the foot of a tree.

   And soon after the departure of the venerable Ananda, Mâra, the Evil
One, came to where the Blessed One was, and drawing near, he stood
respectfully apart and while thus standing Mâra the Evil One said to the
Blessed One: "Pass away now, Exalted One, let the Happy One now die: now
is the time for the Exalted One to pass away from existence, for the
Exalted One has spoken these words: <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> 'I
shall not pass away from existence, thou Wicked One, until I shall have
gained monks as my disciples, who are wise and disciplined, well
trained, secure in the Doctrine, erudite, versed in the Law, experts in
the higher and lower doctrines, correct in their conduct, practised in
the lesser duties, to proclaim, teach, make known, elucidate, analyze,
and make clear what they have learned from their Master, to refute and
demolish by their knowledge any defamation of the doctrine, and to
spread the wonder-working truth abroad'. Now, Sire, the Exalted One has
gained monks as disciples who are wise and disciplined etc. \[as above.
*Transl*.\]: Pass away now, Exalted One, from existence: let the Happy
One now die: now is the time for the Exalted One to pass away from
existence. And the Exalted One, moreover has spoken these words: 'I
shall not pass away from existence, thou Wicked One, until I have gained
nuns as my disciples. \[repetition as above. *Transl*.\].

   Until I have gained male votaries etc. d°. d°.

   Until I have gained female votaries etc. d°. d°.'

   The Exalted One moreover has said: 'I shall not pass away from
existence, thou Wicked One, until the 'holy life' is successful,
prosperous, wide-spread among all sections of humanity, and thoroughly
made manifest to gods and men.' Now, Sire, the 'holy life' spoken of by
the Exalted One, is successful, prosperous, wide-spread among all
sections of humanity, and thoroughly made manifest to gods and men. Pass
away now from existence, Exalted One, let the Happy One now die, now is
the time for the Exalted One to enter into Nirvana."

   When these words had been spoken, the Blessed One said to Mâra, the
Evil One: "Be not anxious, thou Wicked <span id="page_90">p. 90</span>
One; soon will the Perfect One pass away from existence: three months
hence the Perfect One will enter Nirvana."

   And the Blessed One, there in the Câpâla shrine, mindful and
conscious, relinquished the natural term of life, and when the Blessed
One relinquished the natural term of life, the earth quaked, and
thunder, horror-fraught and terrible, burst forth from heaven.

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

<tr class="odd">

   <span id="pp_2"></span>2. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Eastern monastery, in the
pavilion of Migaramâta.

   Now at that time, the Blessed One, having arisen at eventide from his
solitary communings was sitting outside in the portico.

   And the King Pasenadi Kosala went to where the Blessed One was and
drawing near saluted the Blessed One and sat down respectfully apart.

   Now at that time, seven ascetics with long matted hair, seven
Niganthas,<span id="page_90_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_90_note_2) seven Acelas,<span
id="page_90_fr_2"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">2</span></sup>](#page_90_note_2) seven wearing only one
garment, and seven wandering monks with overgrown nails and hair,
carrying with them various requisites of monks, were passing by, not far
from the Blessed One.

   And when the King Pasenadi Kosala beheld these seven <span
id="page_91">p. 91</span> ascetics, etc. \[as above. *Transl*.\] passing
by close to the Blessed One, he arose from his seat and placing his
upper robe upon one shoulder only (leaving the other bare), he knelt
with his right knee on the ground and clasping his hands, three times
proclaimed his name to the ascetics: "I am, reverend Sirs, the King
Pasenadi Kosala."

   Soon after the departure of the ascetics, the King Pasenadi Kosala
went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near he saluted the
Blessed One and sat down apart and while thus sitting the King Pasenadi
Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Are these ascetics, Sire, among those
who are reckoned in this world as saints, or as having entered the path
that leads to Saintship?"

   "Hard is it, Great King, for you, in the enjoyment of a housholder's
life, living surrounded by sons, using the powder of sandal wood from
Benares, wearing perfumed garlands and in the possession of gold and
silver, to tell if these ascetics are saints or on the path that leads
to Saintship. Only by living with them, Great King, for a long time, can
their virtues be ascertained and this requires much reflection, thought,
wisdom and knowledge. Only by associating, Great King, for a long time
with them in their modes of life can their integrity be ascertained, and
this requires \[as above.\]. etc. Only by associating with them, Great
King, for a long time in their troubles can their persistence be
ascertained, and this requires etc. \[as above\].

   Only by conversing with them, Great King, for a long time can their
wisdom be ascertained, and this requires much reflection, thought,
wisdom and knowledge."

   "Wonderful, Sire, marvellous are the words so well spoken by the
Blessed One: 'Hard is it, etc. \[as above\]."

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

   There are, Sire, certain of my people going about the country, who
may be likened to robbers, for they receive alms without having
renounced the world. When these have entered the 'path', I will do
likewise.<span id="page_92_fr_1"></span>[<sup><span
class="small">1</span></sup>](#page_92_note_1) As yet, Sire, these
people have not removed the dust-heap (of desire), and go about,
anointed with oil; with head and beard shorn, in white garments,
possessed of and endowed with the 'five pleasures of sense'."

   And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed
forth this solemn utterance:

   <span id="pp_3"></span>3. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika.

   Now at that time the Blessed One was sitting, looking back upon the
various evil and wicked conditions abandoned by him, and contemplating
the many good conditions fulfilled.

   <span id="pp_4"></span>4. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion,
the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika.

   Now at that time a large number of Samanas, Brahmanas and wandering
monks of various heretical sects, holding a variety of views, doubters
on many points, having many diverse aspirations, and recourse to that
which relates to various heresies, entered Savatthi for alms.

   Some of these Samanas and Brahmanas held that the world is eternal
and contended that this view was true and every other false.

   Some said: the world is not eternal.

   Some said: the world is finite.

   Some said: the world is infinite.

   Some said: the soul and the body are identical.

   Some said: the soul and the body are not identical.

   Some said: the Perfect One continues to exist after death.

   Some said: The Perfect One does not continue to exist after death.

   Some said: The Perfect One exists and does not exist after death.

   Some said: The Perfect One neither exists nor does not exist after
death.

   Each contending their view was true and every other false.

   These quarrelsome, pugnacious, cavilling monks wounded one another
with sharp words (lit. mouth-javelins) declaiming: "such is the truth,
such is not the truth: the truth is not such, such is the truth."

   And a number of Bhikkhus, robing themselves in the forenoon and
taking their alms-bowls and tunics, entered Savatthi for alms and when
they had returned from their <span id="page_94">p. 94</span> rounds and
finished their meal, they went to where the Blessed One was and drawing
near, they saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart, and while thus
sitting they said to the Blessed One: "Just now, Sire, a large number of
Samanas and Brahmanas and wandering monks holding varions heresies
entered Savatthi for alms, and they are disputing among themselves,
saying: "'This is the truth, such is not the truth etc. \[as above.
*Transl*.\]"

   "These heretical monks, O Bhikkhus, are blind, eyeless, they know not
what is right, they know not what is wrong, they know not what is true,
they know not what is false. These monks not perceiving what is right,
not perceiving what is wrong, not perceiving what is true, not
perceiving what is false, become disputations, saying: 'such is the
truth, such is not the truth' etc. \[as above. *Transl*.\]

   In former times, O Bhikkhus, there was a King in this town of
Savatthi. And the King, O Bhikkhus, called a man to him and said: "Go,
thou, and collect all the men born blind in Savatthi and bring them
here."

   "Be it so, Lord" said that man in assent to the King and he went to
Savatthi and he brought all the men born blind in Savatthi to where the
King was and drawing near he said to the King: "Lord, all the men blind
from their birth in Savatthi are present."

   "Pray, then, bring an elephant before them."

   "Be it so, Lord" said that man in assent to the King and he brought
an elephant into the presence of the blind men and said: "This, O blind
men, is an elephant."

   To some of the blind men he presented the head of the elephant,
saying, 'Such, O blind men, is an elephant.'

   To some he presented the body, saying: 'such is an elephant.'

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

   To some he presented the feet, saying: 'Such is an elephant.'

   To some he presented the back, saying: 'Such is an elephant.'

   To some he presented the tail, saying: 'Such is an elephant.'

   To some he presented the hairy tuft of the tail, saying: 'Such is an
elephant.'

   The show-man, O Bhikkhus, having presented the elephant to these
blind ones, went to where the King was and drawing near said to the
King: "The elephant, Lord, has been brought before the blind men, do now
as seems fit."

   And the King went to where the blind men were, and drawing near said
to them: "Do you now know what an elephant is like?"

   "Assuredly, Lord: we now know what an elephant is like."

   "Tell me then, O blind men, what an elephant is like."

   And those blind men, O Bhikkhus, who had felt the head of the
elephant, said: 'An elephant, Sir, is like a large round jar .

   Those who had felt its ears, said: 'it is like a winnowing basket.'

   Those who had felt its tusks, said: 'it is like a plough-share.'

   Those who had felt its trunk, said: 'it is like a plough.'

   Those who had felt its body, said: 'it is like a granary:

   Those who had felt its feet, said: 'it is like a pillar.'

   Those who had felt its back, said: 'it is like a mortar.'

   Those who had felt its tail, said: 'it is a like a pestle.'

   Those who had felt the tuft of its tail, said: 'it is like a broom.'

   And they all fought amongst themselves with their fists, declaring,
'such is an elephant, such is not elephant, an elephant is not like
that, it is like this.'

   And the King, O Bhikkhus, was highly delighted.

   In exactly the same way, O Bhikkhus, do these heretical <span
id="page_96">p. 96</span> people, blind and without insight, dispute
among themselves saying 'this doctrine is true, every other is false'."

   Now at that time a great number of wandering monks, Samanas and
Brahmanas, belonging to various heretical sects, holding a variety of
views, doubters on many points, with diverse aspirations and having
recourse to that which relates to diverse heresies, entered Savatthi for
alms.

   These Samanas and Brahmanas held various views, such as:

   The self and the world are eternal.

   The self and the world are both finite and infinite.

   The self and the world are neither finite nor infinite.

   The self and the world are self-produced.

   The self and the world are both self-produced and other-produced.

   The self and the world are neither self-produced nor other-produced.

   The self and the world spring into existence without a cause.

   The self and the world, ease and discomfort are eternal.

   The self and the world, ease and discomfort, are not eternal.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

   (The above) are both finite and infinite.

   (The above) are self-produced.

   (The above) are other-produced.

   (The above) are both self-produced and other-produced.

   (The above) are both not self-produced and not other-produced, nor
have they sprung into existence without a cause.

   Thus they disagreed, each one declaring 'this view is true, every
other false.'

   And a number of Bhikkhus etc. went to where the Blessed One was and
said: 'Just now, Sire, a number of Samanas and Brahmanas etc. \[as
before. *Transl*.\] saying 'this view is true, every other false.'

   "This people are possessed with the notions, 'I am the doer,'
'another is the doer.' They do not understand (that these are two
heresies). They see no harm in them. He who perceives the harm in them,
does not entertain the ideas, 'I am the doer', 'another is the doer.'

   This people, given to pride, stubborn in pride, in bondage <span

the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of
Anâthapindika.

   Now at that time the venerable Subhuti was sitting not far from the
Blessed One, in a cross-legged position, with body erect, having entered
into a state of thoughtless trance. And the Blessed One saw the

the Blessed One dwelt at Râjagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, in
Kalandikanivapa.

   Now at that time there were two men of Râjagaha deeply enamoured of
and in love with a certain courtezan.

   They quarrelled, argued and disputed, and attacked each other with
trowels, with clods of earth, with sticks and with swords. In this cause
they were prepared to face death and the pangs of death.

   And a large number of Bhikkhus, robing themselves in the forenoon and
taking their alms-bowls and tunics entered Râjagaha for alms and when

attanied, or is to attain is sprinkled over with evil. There are those

\[the aim\] of him who argues thus.

   And there is a second ideal: to wit, that there is no harm in lusts.
Both these ideals of life--that of despair of good, and that of the
sensualist--enlarge the realm of death, and that \[in its turn\] tends
to the increase of speculation. Some, not understanding \[the real
nature of\] these ideals, stick to them, some get beyond them. Those who
see through them, are not in them, do not think that way, their
revolution is beyond perception \[that is, they do not revolve in
Samsara, they attain Nirvana in this life and are not subject to
rebirths and redeaths."\]
