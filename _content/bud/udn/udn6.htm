<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion the Blessed One dwelt at Vesali, in the Mahavana, in the Pagoda Hall.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, having robed himself in the forenoon, and taking his alms-bowl and tunic entered Vesali for alms. And when he had returned from his rounds and finished his meal, he called the venerable Ananda to him and said: "Take up, Ananda, the mat, I will pass the heat of the day at the C&acirc;p&acirc;la shrine."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so, Sire" said the venerable Ananda in assent to the Blessed One, and taking up the mat, he followed the Blessed One step by step.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One went to where the C&acirc;p&acirc;la shrine was, and drawing near, he sat down on the appointed seat, and while thus sitting he called the venerable Ananda to him and said: "Delightful, Ananda, is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine, delightful is the Bahuputta shrine, delightful is the Sarandada shrine, delightful is the C&acirc;p&acirc;la shrine! Whoever, Ananda, has dwelt upon, enlarged, made use of as a vehicle, objectified, taken as a foundation, amalgamated, and most thoroughly striven with the constituents of magic power, if he should so wish, is able to remain in this world a Kalpa,<A NAME="page_87_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_87_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> or the remainder of a

Kalpa. The Perfect One, Ananda, has dwelt upon, enlarged, made use of as a vehicle, objectified, taken as a foundation, amalgamated, and most thoroughly striven with the constituents of magic power, and if he so wish, can remain in this world a Kalpa, or the remainder of a Kalpa."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the venerable Ananda failing to penetrate the meaning of the palpable sign made and the clear hint given by the Blessed One, did not beseech the Blessed One and say: "May it please the Blessed One to remain in this world a Kalpa, may it please the Happy One to remain a Kalpa for the welfare of many, for the happiness of many, in compassion for the people, for the benefit, the advantage, the delight of men and gods--so possessed was the heart of Ananda by the Wicked One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second time the Blessed One called the venerable Ananda to him and said etc. (repetition as above. <I>Transl</I>.].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third time etc. [repetition as above <I>Transl</I>.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One called the venerable Ananda to him and said: "Go now, Ananda, and do as you like."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so, Sire," said the venerable Ananda in assent to the Blessed One and rising from his seat, he saluted the Blessed One, and passing round keeping his right side to him, he went and sat down, not far off, at the foot of a tree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon after the departure of the venerable Ananda, M&acirc;ra, the Evil One, came to where the Blessed One was, and drawing near, he stood respectfully apart and while thus standing M&acirc;ra the Evil One said to the Blessed One: "Pass away now, Exalted One, let the Happy One now die: now is the time for the Exalted One to pass away from existence, for the Exalted One has spoken these words:

<!------------------------page 89------------------------>

<A NAME="page_89"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 89</FONT></A>

'I shall not pass away from existence, thou Wicked One, until I shall have gained monks as my disciples, who are wise and disciplined, well trained, secure in the Doctrine, erudite, versed in the Law, experts in the higher and lower doctrines, correct in their conduct, practised in the lesser duties, to proclaim, teach, make known, elucidate, analyze, and make clear what they have learned from their Master, to refute and demolish by their knowledge any defamation of the doctrine, and to spread the wonder-working truth abroad'. Now, Sire, the Exalted One has gained monks as disciples who are wise and disciplined etc. [as above. <I>Transl</I>.]: Pass away now, Exalted One, from existence: let the Happy One now die: now is the time for the Exalted One to pass away from existence. And the Exalted One, moreover has spoken these words: 'I shall not pass away from existence, thou Wicked One, until I have gained nuns as my disciples. [repetition as above. <I>Transl</I>.].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until I have gained male votaries etc. d&deg;. d&deg;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until I have gained female votaries etc. d&deg;. d&deg;.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Exalted One moreover has said: 'I shall not pass away from existence, thou Wicked One, until the 'holy life' is successful, prosperous, wide-spread among all sections of humanity, and thoroughly made manifest to gods and men.' Now, Sire, the 'holy life' spoken of by the Exalted One, is successful, prosperous, wide-spread among all sections of humanity, and thoroughly made manifest to gods and men. Pass away now from existence, Exalted One, let the Happy One now die, now is the time for the Exalted One to enter into Nirvana."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these words had been spoken, the Blessed One said to M&acirc;ra, the Evil One: "Be not anxious, thou Wicked

<!------------------------page 90------------------------>

<A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A>

One; soon will the Perfect One pass away from existence: three months hence the Perfect One will enter Nirvana."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, there in the C&acirc;p&acirc;la shrine, mindful and conscious, relinquished the natural term of life, and when the Blessed One relinquished the natural term of life, the earth quaked, and thunder, horror-fraught and terrible, burst forth from heaven.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="10">

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_2"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT>. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Eastern monastery, in the pavilion of Migaram&acirc;ta.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time, the Blessed One, having arisen at eventide from his solitary communings was sitting outside in the portico.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King Pasenadi Kosala went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near saluted the Blessed One and sat down respectfully apart.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time, seven ascetics with long matted hair, seven Niganthas,<A NAME="page_90_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_90_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> seven Acelas,<A NAME="page_90_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_90_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> seven wearing only one garment, and seven wandering monks with overgrown nails and hair, carrying with them various requisites of monks, were passing by, not far from the Blessed One.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the King Pasenadi Kosala beheld these seven

<!------------------------page 91------------------------>

<A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A>

ascetics, etc. [as above. <I>Transl</I>.] passing by close to the Blessed One, he arose from his seat and placing his upper robe upon one shoulder only (leaving the other bare), he knelt with his right knee on the ground and clasping his hands, three times proclaimed his name to the ascetics: "I am, reverend Sirs, the King Pasenadi Kosala."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the departure of the ascetics, the King Pasenadi Kosala went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near he saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart and while thus sitting the King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Are these ascetics, Sire, among those who are reckoned in this world as saints, or as having entered the path that leads to Saintship?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hard is it, Great King, for you, in the enjoyment of a housholder's life, living surrounded by sons, using the powder of sandal wood from Benares, wearing perfumed garlands and in the possession of gold and silver, to tell if these ascetics are saints or on the path that leads to Saintship. Only by living with them, Great King, for a long time, can their virtues be ascertained and this requires much reflection, thought, wisdom and knowledge. Only by associating, Great King, for a long time with them in their modes of life can their integrity be ascertained, and this requires [as above.]. etc. Only by associating with them, Great King, for a long time in their troubles can their persistence be ascertained, and this requires etc. [as above].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only by conversing with them, Great King, for a long time can their wisdom be ascertained, and this requires much reflection, thought, wisdom and knowledge."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wonderful, Sire, marvellous are the words so well spoken by the Blessed One: 'Hard is it, etc. [as above]."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, Sire, certain of my people going about the country, who may be likened to robbers, for they receive alms without having renounced the world. When these have entered the 'path', I will do likewise.<A NAME="page_92_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_92_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> As yet, Sire, these people have not removed the dust-heap (of desire), and go about, anointed with oil; with head and beard shorn, in white garments, possessed of and endowed with the 'five pleasures of sense'."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time a large number of Samanas, Brahmanas and wandering monks of various heretical sects, holding a variety of views, doubters on many points, having many diverse aspirations, and recourse to that which relates to various heresies, entered Savatthi for alms.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these Samanas and Brahmanas held that the world is eternal and contended that this view was true and every other false.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said: the world is not eternal.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said: the world is finite.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said: the world is infinite.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said: the soul and the body are identical.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said: the soul and the body are not identical.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said: the Perfect One continues to exist after death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said: The Perfect One does not continue to exist after death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said: The Perfect One exists and does not exist after death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some said: The Perfect One neither exists nor does not exist after death.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each contending their view was true and every other false.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These quarrelsome, pugnacious, cavilling monks wounded one another with sharp words (lit. mouth-javelins) declaiming: "such is the truth, such is not the truth: the truth is not such, such is the truth."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a number of Bhikkhus, robing themselves in the forenoon and taking their alms-bowls and tunics, entered Savatthi for alms and when they had returned from their

<A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A>

rounds and finished their meal, they went to where the Blessed One was and drawing near, they saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart, and while thus sitting they said to the Blessed One: "Just now, Sire, a large number of Samanas and Brahmanas and wandering monks holding varions heresies entered Savatthi for alms, and they are disputing among themselves, saying: "'This is the truth, such is not the truth etc. [as above. <I>Transl</I>.]"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These heretical monks, O Bhikkhus, are blind, eyeless, they know not what is right, they know not what is wrong, they know not what is true, they know not what is false. These monks not perceiving what is right, not perceiving what is wrong, not perceiving what is true, not perceiving what is false, become disputations, saying: 'such is the truth, such is not the truth' etc. [as above. <I>Transl</I>.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In former times, O Bhikkhus, there was a King in this town of Savatthi. And the King, O Bhikkhus, called a man to him and said: "Go, thou, and collect all the men born blind in Savatthi and bring them here."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so, Lord" said that man in assent to the King and he went to Savatthi and he brought all the men born blind in Savatthi to where the King was and drawing near he said to the King: "Lord, all the men blind from their birth in Savatthi are present."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray, then, bring an elephant before them."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so, Lord" said that man in assent to the King and he brought an elephant into the presence of the blind men and said: "This, O blind men, is an elephant."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some of the blind men he presented the head of the elephant, saying, 'Such, O blind men, is an elephant.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some he presented the body, saying: 'such is an elephant.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some he presented the tail, saying: 'Such is an elephant.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some he presented the hairy tuft of the tail, saying: 'Such is an elephant.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The show-man, O Bhikkhus, having presented the elephant to these blind ones, went to where the King was and drawing near said to the King: "The elephant, Lord, has been brought before the blind men, do now as seems fit."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King went to where the blind men were, and drawing near said to them: "Do you now know what an elephant is like?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assuredly, Lord: we now know what an elephant is like."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me then, O blind men, what an elephant is like."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those blind men, O Bhikkhus, who had felt the head of the elephant, said: 'An elephant, Sir, is like a large round jar .</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who had felt its ears, said: 'it is like a winnowing basket.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who had felt its tusks, said: 'it is like a plough-share.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who had felt its trunk, said: 'it is like a plough.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who had felt its body, said: 'it is like a granary:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who had felt its feet, said: 'it is like a pillar.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who had felt its back, said: 'it is like a mortar.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who had felt its tail, said: 'it is a like a pestle.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who had felt the tuft of its tail, said: 'it is like a broom.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they all fought amongst themselves with their fists, declaring, 'such is an elephant, such is not elephant, an elephant is not like that, it is like this.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King, O Bhikkhus, was highly delighted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exactly the same way, O Bhikkhus, do these heretical

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Samanas and Brahmanas held various views, such as:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the venerable Ananda went to where the Blessed One was and having saluted him, sat down apart, and while thus sitting, the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "Until, Sire, the Perfect Ones, the Saints, the Supreme Buddhas are born in the world, the heretical sects and wandering monks are held in honour, worshipped, esteemed and reverenced, and are recipients of the requisites of monks, such as, robes, alms, sleeping places, and drugs in case of sickness, but when the Perfect Ones, the Saints, the Supreme Buddhas appear on earth then these heretical sects and wandering monks are not held in honour, worshipped, esteemed and reverenced and are not recipients of the requisites of monks, such as, robes, alms, sleeping places and drugs in case of sickness.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:</P>
