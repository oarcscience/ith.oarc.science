<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="pp_1"></A><FONT COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT>. Thus have I heard. On a certain occasion the Blessed One dwelt at Savatthi, in the Jetavana, the garden of An&acirc;thapindika.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time the venerable S&acirc;riputta was instructing, arousing, animating and gladdening the venerable Dwarf Bhaddiya with manifold religious discourses.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus instructed, aroused, animated and gladdened by the mainfold religions discourses of the venerable Sariputta, the heart of the venerable Dwarf Bhaddiya was set free from 'attachment' and the sins.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One perceived that the heart of the venerable Bhaddiya was set free from 'attachment' and the sins, through the manifold religious discourses of the venerable S&acirc;riputta.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One perceived the venerable S&acirc;riputta instructing, arousing, animating and gladdening the venerable Dwarf Bhaddiya (whom he thought yet a novice) with manifold religious discourses.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time a number of men were living at Savatthi and all of them were in bondage to the passions, inflamed, glutted, seized and infatuated to excess with lust, falling into sin and impregnated with lust.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a number of Bhikkhus, robing themselves in the forenoon and taking their alms-bowls and tunics entered Savatthi for alms, and when they had returned from their rounds in Savatthi and finished their meal, they went to where the Blessed One was, and drawing near, they saluted the Blessed One and sat down apart and while

thus sitting they said to the Blessed One: "at this time, Sire, a number of men are passing their days in Savatthi, in bondage to the passions etc. [as above. <I>Transl</I>.]."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time a number of men were living at Savatthi, and all of them were in bondage to the passions, inflamed, glutted, seized and infatuated to excess with lust, falling into sin, blinded and impregnated with lust.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, robing himself in the forenoon and taking his alms-bowl and tunic entered Savatthi for alms.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One beheld these men living at Savatthi and all of them in bondage to the passions, inflamed etc. [as above. <I>Transl</I>.].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that time the venerable dwarf Bhaddiya, following step by step in the wake of a large number of Bhikkhus, came to where the Blessed One was.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the Blessed One beheld the venerable dwarf Bhaddiya, coming along in the wake of the Bhikkhus, ill-favored, evil to behold, lowly in gait and despised by the majority of the Bhikkhus, he called the Bhikkhus to him and said: "Behold, O Bhikkhus, this mendicant approaching from afar, ill-favored, evil to behold, lowly in gait, and despised by the majority of Bhikkhus,"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even so, Sire."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This mendicant, O Bhikkhus, is mighty in power, great in strength: this state of perfection, not formerly attained by this Bhikkhu, is not easily attained; for the sake of which scions of noble family abandon their homes for homelessness and by themselves in this very existence, through the higher knowledge, realize and attain to that supreme consummation, the holy life."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, in this connection, on that occasion, breathed forth this solemn utterance:</P>

country and he came to Thuna, a Brahman village, in the Malla country.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Brahman housholders of Thuna, on hearing that the Samana Gotama--he who had gone forth from a Sakya family--was traversing the Malla country in company with the Brotherhood and had arrived at Thuna, they filled up the well to the brim with grass and straw, so that these shaven monks, as they called them, should not obtain water to drink.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blessed One, leaving the road, went to the foot of a tree and drawing near sat down on the appointed seat and while thus sitting he said to Ananda: "Bring me, I pray, Ananda, some water from that well."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these words had been spoken, the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "That well, Sire, has been filled up to the brim with grass and straw by the Brahman housholders of Thuna, so that we, shaven monks, as they call us, may not obtain water to drink."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second time the Blessed One said to the venerable Ananda: "Bring me, I pray thee, Ananda, some water from that well."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second time the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: 'That well, Sire, has been filled up etc. [as above. <I>Transl</I>.].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third time the Blessed One said to the venerable Ananda: "Bring me, I pray thee, Ananda, some water from that well."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So be it, Sire" said the venerable Ananda in assent to the Blessed One and he went to the well, taking with him a bowl.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he arrived at the well he found that all the grass and straw had been removed and that it was full

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thought occurred to the venerable Ananda: "How astonishing, how marvellous is the mighty power and great strength of the Perfect One, that on my arrival all the grass and straw were removed and the well was full to the brim, even to overflowing, of clear, pure, translucent water."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taking some water in the bowl, he went to where the Blessed One was and said to the Blessed One: "How astonishing, how marvellous, is the mighty power and great strength of the Perfect One, by which the grass and straw was removed etc. [as above. <I>Transl</I>.].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink, Exalted One, of the water: Drink, Happy One, of the water."</P>

Whither have these female votaries departed, and what will be their future condition?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are, O Bhikkhus, some lay disciples who have entered the stream, some who return (to this world) once again, some who never return. All these lay disciples who perished are not without reward."</P>
