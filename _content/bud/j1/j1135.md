"*Wise counsels heeding*."--This story was told by the Master while at
Jetavana about the Sutta concerning the Temptation by the Daughters of
Māra <span id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_188) at the Goat-herds'
Banyan-tree. The Master quoted the Sutta, beginning with its opening
words:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

In all their dazzling beauty on they came,  
--Craving and Hate and Lust. Like cotton-down  
Before the wind, the Master made them fly.

</div>

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

After he had recited the Sutta right through to the end, the Brethren
met together in the Hall of Truth and spoke of how the Daughters of Māra
drew near in all their myriad charms yet failed to seduce the
All-Enlightened One. For he did not as much as open his eyes to look
upon them, so marvellous was he! Entering the hall, the Master asked,
and was told, what they were discussing. "Brethren," said he, "it is no
marvel that I did not so much as look upon the Daughters of Māra in this
life when I have put sin from me and have won enlightenment. In former
days when I was but in quest of Wisdom, when sin still dwelt within me,
I found strength not to gaze even upon loveliness divine by way of lust
in violation of virtue; and by that continence I won a kingdom." So
saying, he told this story of the past.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was the youngest of a hundred brothers, and his adventures are to be
detailed here, as above \[470\] in the Takkasilā-Jātaka <span
id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_189). When the kingdom had been offered to
the Bodhisatta by the people, and when he had accepted it and been
anointed king, the people decorated the town like a city of the gods and
the royal palace like the palace of Indra. Entering the city the
Bodhisatta passed into the spacious hall of the palace and there seated
himself in all his godlike beauty on his jewelled throne beneath the
white umbrella of his Kingship. Round him in glittering splendour stood
his ministers and brahmins and nobles, whilst sixteen thousand nautch
girls, fair as the nymphs of heaven, sang and danced and made music,
till the palace was loud with sounds like the ocean when the storm
bursts in thunder on its waters <span id="fr_191"></span>[2](#fn_190).
Gazing round on the pomp of his royal state, the Bodhisatta thought how,
had he looked upon the charms of the ogresses, he would have perished
miserably, nor ever have lived to see his present magnificence, which he
owed to his following the counsels of the Pacceka Buddhas. And as these
thoughts filled his heart, his emotion found vent in these verses:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Wise counsels heeding, firm in my resolve,  
With dauntless heart still holding on my course,  
I shunned the Sirens' dwellings and their snares,  
And found a great salvation in my need.

</div>

\[471\] So ended the lesson which these verses taught. And the Great
Being ruled his kingdom in righteousness, and abounded in charity and
other good works till in the end he passed away to fare according to his
deserts.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "I was the
prince of those days who went to Takkasilā and won a kingdom."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_188"></span>[288:1](j1135.htm#fr_189) See pp. 78 and 79 of
Volume I. of the text for the temptation. I have not been able to trace
the Palobhana Sutta referred to.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[289:1](j1135.htm#fr_190) Apparently the
reference is to No. [96](j1099.htm#an_j096). For a like confusion of
title see note [1](j1045.htm#fn_100), [p. 112](j1045.htm#page_112).

<span id="fn_190"></span>[289:2](j1135.htm#fr_191) Or is the meaning
'like the vault of heaven filled with thunder-clouds'? Cf. *arṇava* in
the Rigveda.
