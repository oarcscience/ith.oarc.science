"*’Twas greed*."..Ṭhis story was told by the Master while at Jetavana,
about another hypocrite.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was King of the Rats and dwelt in the forest. Now a fire broke out in
the forest, and a jackal who could not run away put his head against a
tree \[462\] and let the flames sweep by him. The fire singed the hair
off his body everywhere, and left him perfectly bald, except for a tuft
like a scalp-knot <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_185) where the crown
of his head was pressed against the tree. Drinking one day in a rocky
pool, he caught sight of this top-knot reflected in the water. "At last
I've got wherewithal to go to market," thought he. Coming in the course
of his wanderings in the forest to the rats' cave, he said to himself,
"I'll hoodwink those rats and devour them;" and with this intent he took
up his stand hard by, just as in the foregoing story.

On his way out in quest of food, the Bodhisatta observed the jackal and,
crediting the beast with virtue and goodness, came to him and asked what
his name was.

"Bhāradvāja <span id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_186), Votary of the
Fire-God."

"Why have you come here?"

"In order to guard you and yours."

"What will you do to guard us?"

"I know how to count on my fingers, and will count your numbers both
morning and evening, so as to be sure that as many came home at night,
as went out in the morning. That's how I'll guard you."

"Then stay, uncle, and watch over us."

And accordingly, as the rats were starting in the morning he set about
counting them "One, two, three;" and so again when they came back at
night. And every time he counted them, he seized and ate the hindmost.
Everything came to pass as in the foregoing story, except that here the
King of the Rats turned and said to the jackal, "It is not sanctity,

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhāradvāja, Votary
of the Fire-God, but gluttony that has decked your crown with that
top-knot." So saying, he uttered this stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

’Twas greed, not virtue, furnished you this crest.  
Our dwindling numbers fail to work out right;  
We've had enough, Fire-votary, of you.

His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "This
Brother was the jackal of those days, and I the King of the Rats."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_185"></span>[283:1](j1132.htm#fr_186) The Buddhist
'Brother' shaves his crown, except for a tuft of hair on the top, which
is the analogue of the tonsure of Roman Catholic priests.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[283:2](j1132.htm#fr_187) Bhāradvāja was the
name of a clan of great Rishis, or religious teachers, to whom the sixth
book of the Rigveda is ascribed.
