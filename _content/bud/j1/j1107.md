"*From four to eight*."--This story was told by the Master while at
Jetavana, concerning an unruly Brother. The incidents are the same as
those in the previous story of Mittavindaka <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_165), but belong to the days of the Buddha
Kassapa.

\[414\] Now at that time one of the damned who had put on the circlet
and was suffering the tortures of hell, asked the Bodhisatta--"Lord,
what sin have I committed?" The Bodhisatta detailed the man's evil deeds
to hire and uttered this stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

From four to eight, to sixteen thence, and so  
To thirty-two insatiate greed doth go,  
--Still pressing on till insatiety  
Doth win the circlet's griding misery <span
id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_166).

So saying he went back to the Realm of Devas, but the other abode in
hell till his sin had been purged from him. Then he passed thence to
fare according to his deserts.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "This
unruly Brother was then Mittavindaka and I the Deva."
