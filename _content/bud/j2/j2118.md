"*When many a bow*," *etc*.--This story the Master told in Jetavana,
about a Brother who had lost all energy. The Master asked, was it true
that this Brother had lost his energy. Yes, he replied. "Why," asked he,
"have you slackened your energy, after embracing this doctrine of
salvation? In days of yore, wise men were energetic even in matters
which do not lead to salvation;" and so saying he told an old-world
tale.

Once on a time, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
was born into the family of a forester. When he grew up, he took the
lead of a band of five hundred foresters, and lived in a village at the
entrance to the forest. He used to hire himself out to guide men through
it.

Now one day a man of Benares, a merchant's son, arrived at that village
with a caravan of five hundred waggons. Sending for the Bodhisatta, he
offered him a thousand pieces to be his guide through the forest. He
agreed, and received the money from the merchant's hand; and as he took
it, he mentally devoted his life to the merchant's service. Then he
guided him into the forest.

In the midst of the forest, up rose five hundred robbers. As for the
rest of the company, no sooner did they see these robbers, than they
grovelled upon their belly: the head forester alone, shouting and
leaping and dealing blows, put to flight all the five hundred robbers,
and led the merchant across the wood in safety. Once across the forest,
the merchant encamped his caravan; \[336\] he gave the chief forester
choice meats of every kind, and himself having broken his fast, sat
pleasantly by him, and talked with him thus: "Tell me," said he, "how it
was that even when five hundred robbers, with arms in their hands, were
spread all around, you felt not even any fear in your heart?" And he
uttered the first stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When many a bow the shaft at speed let fly--  
Hands grasping blades of tempered steel were nigh--  
When Death had marshalled all his dread array--  
Why, 'mid such terror, felt you no dismay?"</span>

</div>

On hearing this the forester repeated the two verses following:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"When many a bow the shaft at speed let fly--  
Hands grasping blades of tempered steel were nigh--  
When Death had marshalled all his dread array--  
I felt a great and mighty joy this day.

"And this my joy gave me the victory;  
I was resolved to die, if need should be;  
He must contemn his life, who would fulfil  
Heroic deeds and be a hero still."

</div>

\[337\] Thus did he send forth his words like a shower of arrows; and
having explained how he had done heroically through being free from the
desire to live, he parted from the young merchant, and returned to his
own village; where after giving alms and doing good he passed away to
fare according to his deserts.

When the Master had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths, and
identified the Birth:--at the conclusion of the Truths the disheartened
Brother attained to Sainthood:--"At that time I was the chief of the
foresters."
