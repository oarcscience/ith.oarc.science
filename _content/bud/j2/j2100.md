### PĀDAÑJALI-JĀTAKA.

"*Surely this lad*," *etc*.--This story the Master told while dwelling
in Jetavana, about the Elder Lāḷudāyi.

One day, it is said, the two chief disciples were discussing a question.
The Brethren who heard the discussion praised the Elders. Elder
Lāḷudāyi, who sat amongst the company, curled his lip with the
thought--"What is their knowledge compared with mine?" When the Brethren
noticed this, they left him. The company broke up.

The Brethren were talking about it in the Hall of Truth. "Friend, did
you see how Lāḷudāyi curled his lip in scorn of the two chief
disciples?" On hearing which the Master said, "Brethren, in olden days,
as now, Lāḷudāyi had no other answer but a curl of the lip." Then he
told them an old-world tale.

\[264\] Once upon a time, when king Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares,
the Bodhisatta was his adviser in things spiritual and temporal. Now the
king had a sun, Pādañjali by name, an idle lazy loafer. By and bye the
king died. His obsequies over, the courtiers talked of consecrating his
son Pādañjali to be king. But the Bodhisatta said,

"’Tis a lazy fellow, an idle loafer,--shall we take and consecrate him
king?"

The courtiers held a trial. They sat the youth down before them, and
made a wrong decision. They adjudged something to the wrong owner, and
asked him, "Young sir, do we decide rightly?"

The lad curled his lip.

"He is a wise lad, I think," thought the Bodhisatta; "he must know that
we have decided wrongly:" and he recited the first verse:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Surely the lad is wise beyond all men.  
He curls his lip--he must see through us, then!"</span>

</div>

Next day, as before, they arranged a trial, but this time judged it
aright. Again they asked him what he thought of it.

Again he curled his lip. Then the Bodhisatta perceived that he was blind
fool, and repeated the second verse:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Not right from wrong, nor bad from good he knows:  
He curls his lip--but no more sense he shows."</span>

</div>

The courtiers became aware that the young man Pādañjali was a fool, and
they made the Bodhisatta king.

When the Master had ended this discourse, he identified the Birth:
"Lāḷudāyi was Pādañjali, and I was the wise courtier."
