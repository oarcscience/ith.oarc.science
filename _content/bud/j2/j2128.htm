<p>[365] "<i>Who is this pretty Crane</i>," etc.--This story the Master told at Jetavana about some greedy Brother. The two stories are just the same as the last. And these are the verses:--</p>  
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Who is this pretty Crane, and why<br> Does he in my Crow's basket lie?<br> An angry bird, my friend the Crow!<br> This is his nest, I'd have you know!"</p>  
<p>"Do you not know me, friend, indeed?<br> Together we were used to feed!<br> I would not do as I was told,<br> So now I'm plucked, as you behold."</p>  
<p>"You'll come to grief again, I know--<br> It is your nature to do so.<br> When people make a dish of meat<br> &#8217;Tis not for little birds to eat."</small></div></p>  
<p>As before, the Bodhisatta said--"I can't live here any more," and flew away some whither.</p>  
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>  
<p>When this discourse was ended, the Master declared the Truths and identified the Birth:--at the conclusion of the Truths, the greedy Brother attained the Fruit of the Third Path:--"The greedy Brother was the Crow, and I was the Pigeon."</p>
