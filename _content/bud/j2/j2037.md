### GIRIDANTA-JĀTAKA.

\[98\] "*Thanks to the groom*," *etc*.--This story the Master told while
staying in Veḷuvana Park, about keeping bad company. The circumstances
have been already recounted under the Mahilāmukha Jātaka <span
id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63). Again, as before, the Master said: "In
former days this Brother kept bad company just as he does now." Then he
told an old story.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, there was a king named Sāma, the Black, reigning in
Benares. In those days the Bodhisatta was one of a courtier's family,
and grew up to be the king's temporal and spiritual adviser. Now the
king had a state horse named Paṇḍava, and one Giridanta was his trainer,
a lame man. The horse used to watch him as he tramped on and on in
front, holding the halter; and knowing him to be his trainer, imitated
him and limped too.

Somebody told the king how the horse was limping. The king sent
surgeons. They examined the horse, but found him perfectly sound; and so
accordingly made report. Then the king sent the Bodhisatta. "Go,
friend," said he, "and find out all about it." He soon found out that
the horse was lame because he went about with a lame trainer. So he told
the king what it was. "It's a case of bad company," said he, and went on
to repeat the first stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thanks to the groom, poor Paṇḍava is in a parlous
state:  
No more displays his former ways, but needs must imitate."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

"Well, now, my friend," said the king, "what's to be done?" "Get a good
groom," replied the Bodhisatta, "and the horse will be as good as ever."
Then he repeated the second stanza:--\[99\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Find but a fit and proper groom, on whom you can
depend,  
To bridle him and exercise, the horse will quickly mend;  
His sorry plight will be set right; he imitates his friend."</span>

</div>

The king did so. The horse became as good as before. The king showed
great honour to the Bodhisatta, being pleased that he knew even the ways
of animals.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Master, when this discourse was ended, identified the
Birth:--"Devadatta was Giridanta in those days; the Brother who keeps
bad company was the horse; and the wise counsellor was I myself."
