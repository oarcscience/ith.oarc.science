"*Ripe are the figs*," *etc*.--This story the Master told at Jetavana,
about a certain Brother, who had made a hermitage to live in at a
certain village on the frontier. This delightful dwelling stood upon a
flat rock; a little well-swept spot, with enough water to make it
pleasant, a village close at hand to go your rounds in, and friendly
people to give food. A Brother on his rounds arrived at this place. The
Elder who lived in it did the duties of host to the new arrival, and
next day took him along with him for his rounds. The people gave him
food, and invited him to visit them again next day. After the new-comer
had thus fared a few days, he meditated by what means he could oust the
other \[445\] and get hold of the hermitage. Once when he had come <span
id="fr_238"></span>[2](#fn_237) to wait upon the Elder, he asked, "Have
you ever visited the Buddha, friend?" "Why no, Sir; there's

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

no one here to look after my hut, or I should have gone before." "Oh,
I'll look after it while you are gone to visit the Buddha," said the
new-comer; and so the owner went, after laying injunctions upon the
villagers to take care of the holy Brother until his return. The
new-comer proceeded to backbite his host, and hinted to the villagers
all sorts of faults in him. The other visited his Master, and returned;
but the new-corner refused him harbourage. He found a place to abide in,
and next day went on his rounds in the village. But the villagers would
not do their duty by hire. He was much discouraged, and went hack to
Jetavana, where he told the Brethren all about it. They began to discuss
the matter in their Ball of Truth: "Friend, Brother So-and-so has turned
Brother So-and-so out of his hermitage, and taken it for himself!" The
Master came in, and wanted to know what they were discussing as they sat
there. They told him. Said he, "Brethren, this is not the first time
that this man turned the other out of his dwelling;" and he told them an
old-world tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once on a time, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta
became a Tree-spirit in the woods. At that time during the rainy season
rain used to pour down seven days on a stretch. A certain small
red-faced Monkey lived in a rock-cave sheltered from the rain. One day
he was sitting at the mouth of it, in the dry, quite happy. As he sat
there, a big black-faced Monkey, wet through, perishing with cold, spied
him. "How can I get that fellow out, and live in his hole?" he wondered.
Puffing out his belly, and making as though he had eaten a good meal, he
stopped in front of the other, and repeated the first stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ripe are the figs, the banyans good,  
And ready for the Monkey's food.  
Come along with me and eat!  
Why should you for hunger fret?"</span>

</div>

\[446\] Redface believed all this, and longed to have all this fruit to
eat. So he went off, and hunted here, and hunted there, but no fruit
could he find. Then he came back again; and there was Blackface sitting
inside his cave! He determined to outwit him; so stopping in front he
repeated the second stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Happy he who honour pays  
To his elders full of days;  
Just as happy I feel now  
After all that fruit, I vow!"</span>

</div>

The big monkey listened, and repeated the third:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of
war;  
A monkey scents a monkey's tricks afar.  
Even a young one were too sharp by half;  
But old birds never can be caught with chaff."</span>

</div>

The other made off.

When the Master ended this discourse, he summed up the birth-tale: "At
that time the owner of the hut was the little monkey, the interloper was
the big black monkey, but the Tree-spirit was I myself."
