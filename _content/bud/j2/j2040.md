"*Sit and sing*," *etc*.--This story the Master told while staying at
Jetavana, about an old Brother. Once, we are told, two of the chief
disciples were sitting together, questioning and answering; when up came
au old Brother, and

made a third. \[107\] Taking a seat, he said, "I have a question too,
Sirs, which I should like to ask you: and if you have any difficulty,
you may put it to me." The Elders were disgusted; they rose up and left
him. The congregation who listened to the discourse of the Elders, after
the meeting broke up, came to the Master; he asked what brought them
there untimely and they told him what had happened. He replied, "This is
not the first time, Brethren, that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have been
disgusted with this man, and left him without a word; it was just the
same in olden days." And he proceeded to tell a story of the past.

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta
became a tree-sprite that lived in a forest. Two young Geese flew down
from Mount Cittakūṭa and perched upon this tree. They flew about in
search of food, returned thither again, and after resting flew back to
their mountain home. As time went on and on, the sprite struck up a
friendship with them. Coming and going, they were great friends, and
used to talk of religion to one another before they parted.

It happened one day as the birds sat on the treetop, talking with the
Bodhisatta, that a Jackal, halting at the foot of the tree, addressed
the young Geese in the words of the following stanza:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sit and sing upon the tree  
If in private you would be.  
Sit upon the ground, and sing  
Verses to the beasts' own king!"</span>

</div>

Filled with disgust, the young Geese took wing and flew back to
Cittakūṭa. When they were gone, the Bodhisatta repeated the second
stanza for the Jackal's benefit:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Fairwing here to fairwing sings,  
God to god sweet converse brings;  
Perfect beauty <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69), you must then  
Back into your hole again!"</span>

</div>

\[108\] When the Master had ended this discourse, he identified the
Birth:--"In those times the old man was the Jackal, Sāriputta and
Moggallāna the two young Geese, and I myself was the tree-sprite."

<span id="fn_69"></span>[74:1](j2040.htm#fr_69) Lit. 'lovely in four
points,' *i.e.* as the schol. explains 'in form, in birth, in voice, in
quality': said sarcastically.
