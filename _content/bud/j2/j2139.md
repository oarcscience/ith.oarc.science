\[419\] "*Envy not what Celery eats*" *etc*.--This story the Master told
in Jetavana, about the temptation springing from a fat girl. The
circumstances will be explained in the Cullanāradakassapa <span
id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_217) story. So the Master asked this brother
whether it was true he had fallen in love. Yes, he said. "With whom?"
the Master asked. "With a fat girl." "That woman, brother," said the
Master, "is your bane; long ago, as now, you became food for the crowd
through your desire to marry her." Then at the request of the brethren
he told an old-world tale.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta
was an ox named Big Redcoat, and he had a young brother called Little
Redcoat. Both of them worked for a family in some village.

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

There was in this family a grown-up girl, who was asked in marriage by
another family. Now in the first family a pig called Sālūka or
Celery <span id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_218), was being fatted, on
purpose to serve for a feast on the wedding-day; it used to sleep in a
sty <span id="fr_220"></span>[2](#fn_219).

One day, Little Redcoat said to his brother, "Brother, we work for this
family, and we help them to get their living. Yet they only give us
grass and straw, while they feed you pig with rice porridge, and let it
sleep in a sty; and what can it do for them?"

"Brother," said Big Redcoat, "don't covet his porridge. They want to
make a feast of him on our young lady's wedding-day, that's why they are
fattening him up. Wait a few days, and you'll see him dragged out of his
sty, killed, chopped into bits, and eaten up by the visitors." So
saying, he composed the first two stanzas: \[420\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Envy not what Celery eats;  
Deadly is the food he gets.  
Be content and eat your chaff:  
It means long life on your behalf.

"By and bye the guest will come,  
With his gossips all and some.  
All chopt up poor Celery  
With his big flat snout will lie."

</div>

A few days after, the wedding guests came, and Sālūka was killed and
made a meal of. Both oxen, seeing what became of him, thought their own
chaff was the best.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The Master, in his perfect wisdom, repeated the third stanza by way of
explanation:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When they saw the flat-snout lie  
All chopt up, poor Celery,  
Said the oxen, Best by half  
Surely is our humble chaff!"</span>

</div>

When the Master had finished this discourse, he declared the Truths, and
identified the Birth:--at the conclusion of the Truths, the Brother in
question attained the fruition of the First Path:--"At that time, the
stout girl was the same, the lovesick brother was Sālūka, Ānanda was
Little Redcoat, and I was Big Redcoat myself." '
