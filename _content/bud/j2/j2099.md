"*The wicked kills*," *etc*.--This is a story which the Master told
while staying in his gabled chamber near Vesāli, about Sīhasenāpati.

It is said that this man, after he had fled to the Refuge, offered
hospitality and then gave food with meat in it. The naked ascetics on
hearing this were angry and displeased; they wanted to do the Buddha a
mischief; "The priest Gotama," sneered they, "with his eyes open, eats
meat prepared on purpose for him."

The Brethren discussed this matter in their Hall of Truth: "Friend,
Nāthaputta the Ascetic <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_149) goes about
sneering, because, he says, 'Priest Gotama eats meat prepared on purpose
for him, with his eyes open'." Hearing this, the Master rejoined:--"This
is not the first time, Brethren, that Nāthaputta has been sneering at me
for eating meat which was got ready for me on purpose; he did just so in
former times. And he told them an old-world tale.

Once on a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was
born a brahmin. When he came of age he embraced the religious life.

He came down from Himalaya to get salt and seasoning, and next day
walked the city, begging alms. A certain wealthy man designed to annoy
the ascetic. So he brought him to his dwelling, and pointed out a seat,
and then served him with fish. After the meal, the man sat on one side,
and said,

"This food was prepared on purpose for you, by killing living creatures.
Not upon my head is this wrong, but upon yours!" And he repeated the
first stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The wicked kills, and cooks, and gives to eat:  
He is defiled with sin that takes such meat."</span>

</div>

\[263\] On hearing this, the Bodhisatta recited the second stanza:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The wicked may for gift slay wife or son,  
Yet, if the holy eat, no sin is done <span
id="fr_150"></span>[2](#fn_150)."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

And the Bodhisatta with these words of instruction rose from his seat
and departed.

This discourse ended, the Master identified the Birth: "Nāthaputta, the
Naked Ascetic was this wealthy man, and I was the ascetic."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_149"></span>[182:1](j2099.htm#fr_149) He is one of the six
*titthiyas* (Heretics), and generally called *Nātaputta* (which is
probably the right spelling here). The 'naked ascetics' were probably
the Jains.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[182:2](j2099.htm#fr_150) "..Ṭhose who take
life are in fault, but not the persons who eat the flesh; my priests
have permission to eat whatever food it is customary to eat in any place
or country, so that it be done without the indulgence of the appetite,
or evil desire." Hardy, *Manual*, p. 327.
