<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE PERIOD [OF THE LAW, DHARMAPARY&Acirc;YA].</H1>
<P>Thereupon the Lord S&acirc;kyamuni, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., rose from his pulpit, collected the Bodhisattvas, took their right hands with his own right hand, which had become strong by the exercise of magic, and spoke on that occasion as follows: Into your hands, young men of good family, I transfer and transmit, entrust and deposit this supreme and perfect enlightenment arrived at by me after hundred thousands of myriads of kotis of incalculable &AElig;ons. Ye, young men of good family, do your best that it may grow and spread.</P>
<P>A second time, a third time the Lord spoke to the host of Bodhisattvas after taking them by the right hands: Into your hands, young men of good family, I transfer and transmit, entrust and deposit this supreme and perfect enlightenment arrived at by me after hundred thousands of myriads of kotis of incalculable &AElig;ons. Receive it, young men of good family, keep, read, fathom, teach, promulgate, and preach it to all beings. I am not avaricious, young men of good family, nor narrow-minded; I am confident and willing to impart Buddha-knowledge, to impart the knowledge of the Tath&acirc;gata, the knowledge of the Self-born. I am a bountiful giver, young men of good family, and ye, young men of good family, follow my example; imitate me in liberally showing this knowledge of the Tath&acirc;gata, and in skilfulness, and preach this Dharmaparyaya to the young men and young ladies of good family who successively shall gather round you. And as to unbelieving persons, rouse them to accept this law. By so doing, young men of good family, you will acquit your debt to the Tath&acirc;gatas.</P>
<P>So addressed by the Lord S&acirc;kyamuni, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., the Bodhisattvas filled with delight and joy, and with a feeling of great respect they lowered, bent, and bowed their body towards the Lord, and, the head inclined and the joined hands stretched out, they spoke in one voice to the Lord S&acirc;kyamuni, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., the following words: We shall do, O Lord, what the Tath&acirc;gata commands; we shall fulfil the command of all Tath&acirc;gatas. Let the Lord be at ease as to this, and perfectly quiet. A second time, a third time the entire host of Bodhisattvas spoke in, one voice the same words: Let the Lord be at ease as to this, and perfectly quiet. We shall do, O Lord, what the Tath&acirc;gata commands us; we shall fulfil the command of all Tath&acirc;gatas.</P>
<P>Thereupon the Lord S&acirc;kyamuni, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., dismissed all those Tath&acirc;gatas, &amp;c., who had come to the gathering from other worlds, and wished them a happy existence, with the words: May the Tath&acirc;gatas, &amp;c., live happy. Then he restored the St&ucirc;pa of precious substances of the Lord Prabh&ucirc;taratna, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., to its place, and wished him also a happy existence.</P>
<P>Thus spoke the Lord. The incalculable, innumerable Tath&acirc;gatas, &amp;c., who had come from other worlds and were sitting on their thrones at the foot of jewel trees, as well as Prabh&ucirc;taratna, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., and the whole host of Bodhisattvas headed by Visishtak&acirc;ritra, the innumerable, incalculable Bodhisattvas Mah&acirc;sattvas who had issued from the gaps of the earth, the great disciples, the four classes, the world, including gods, men, demons, and Gandharvas, in ecstasy applauded the words of the Lord.</P>
