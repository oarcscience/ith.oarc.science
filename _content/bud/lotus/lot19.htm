<P>The Lord then addressed the Bodhisattva Mahisattva Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta. In a similar way, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, one may infer from what has been said that he who rejects such a Dharmapary&acirc;ya as this, who abuses monks, nuns, lay devotees male or female, keeping this S&ucirc;tra, insults them, treats them with false and harsh words, shall experience dire results, to such an extent as is impossible to express in words. But those that keep, read, comprehend, teach, amply expound it to others, shall experience happy results, such as I have already mentioned: they shall attain such a perfection of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind as just described.</P>
<P>In the days of yore, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, at a past period, before incalculable &AElig;ons, nay, more than incalculable, immense, inconceivable, and even long before, there appeared in the world a Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., named Bh&icirc;shmagargitasvarar&acirc;ga, endowed with science and conduct, a Sugata, &amp;c. &amp;c., in the &AElig;on Vinirbhoga, in the world Mah&acirc;sambhava. Now, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, that Lord Bh&icirc;shmagargitasvarar&acirc;ga, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., in that world Vinirbhoga, showed the law in the presence of the world, including gods, men, and demons; the law containing the four noble truths and starting from the chain of causes and efferts, tending to overcome birth, decrepitude, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, woe, grief, despondency, and finally leading to Nirv&acirc;na, he showed to the disciples; the law connected with the six Perfections of virtue and terminating in the knowledge of the Omniscient, after the attainment of supreme, perfect enlightenment, he showed to the Bodhisattvas. The lifetime of that Lord Bh&icirc;shmagargitasvarar&acirc;ga, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., lasted forty hundred thousand myriads of kotis of &AElig;ons equal to the sands of the river Ganges. After his complete extinction his true law remained hundred thousands of myriads of kotis of &AElig;ons equal to the atoms (contained) in Gambudv&icirc;pa, and the counterfeit of the true law continued hundred thousands of myriads of kotis of &AElig;ons equal to the dust-atoms in the four continents. When the counterfeit of the true law of the Lord Bh&icirc;shmagargitasvarar&acirc;ga, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., after his complete extinction, had disappeared in the world Mah&acirc;sambhava, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, another Tath&acirc;gata Bh&icirc;shmagargitasvarar&acirc;ga, Arhat, &amp;c., appeared, endowed with science and conduct. So in succession, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, there arose in that world Mah&acirc;sambhava twenty hundred thousand myriads of kotis of Tath&acirc;gatas, &amp;c., called Bh&icirc;shmagargitasvarar&acirc;ga. At the time, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, after the complete extinction of the first Tath&acirc;gata amongst all those of the name of Bh&icirc;shmagargitasvarar&acirc;ga, Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., endowed with science and conduct, &amp;c. &amp;c., when his true law had disappeared and the counterfeit of the true law was fading; when the reign (of the law) was being oppressed by proud monks, there was a monk, a Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva, called Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta. For what reason, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, was that Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva called Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta? It was, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, because that Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva was in the habit of exclaiming to every monk or nun, male or female lay devotee, while approaching them: I do not contemn you, worthies. You deserve no contempt, for you all observe the course of duty of Bodhisattvas and are to become Tath.&acirc;gatas, &amp;c. In this way, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, that Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva, when a monk, did not teach nor study; the only thing he did was, whenever he descried from afar a monk or nun, a male or female lay devotee, to approach them and exclaim: I do not contemn you, sisters. You deserve no contempt, for you all observe the course of duty of Bodhisattvas and are to become Tath&acirc;gatas, &amp;c. So, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, the Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva at that time used to address every monk or nun, male or female devotee. But all were extremely irritated and angry at it, showed him their displeasure, abused and insulted him: Why does he, unasked, declare that he feels no contempt for us? just by so doing he shows a contempt for us. He renders himself contemptible by predicting our future destiny to supreme, perfect enlightenment; we do not care for what is not true. Many years, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, went on during which that Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva was being abused, but he was not angry at anybody, nor felt malignity, and to those who, when he addressed them in the said manner, cast a clod or stick at him, he loudly exclaimed from afar: I do not contemn you. Those monks and nuns, male and female lay devotees, being always and ever addressed by him in that phrase gave him the (nick)name of Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta.</P>
<P>Under those circumstances, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, the Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta happened to hear this Dharmapary&acirc;ya of the Lotus of the True Law when the end of his life was impending, and the moment of dying drawing near. It was the Lord Bh&icirc;shmagargitasvarar&acirc;ga, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., who expounded this Dharmapary&acirc;ya in twenty times twenty hundred thousand myriads of kotis of stanzas, which the Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta heard from a voice in the sky, when the time of his death was near at hand. On hearing that voice from the sky, without there appearing a person speaking, he grasped this Dharmapary&acirc;ya and obtained the perfections already mentioned: the perfection of sight, hearing, smell, taste, body, and mind. With the attainment of these perfections he at the same time made a vow to prolong his life for twenty hundred thousand myriads of kotis of years, and promulgated this Dharmapary&acirc;ya of the Lotus of the True Law. And all those proud beings, monks, nuns, male and female lay devotees to whom he had said: I do not contemn you, and who had given him the name of Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta, became all his followers to hear the law, after they had seen the power and strength of his sublime magic faculties, of his vow, of his readiness of wit, of his wisdom. All those and many hundred thousand myriads of kotis of other beings were by him roused to supreme, perfect enlightenment.</P>
<P>Afterwards, Mah&acirc;sthamapr&acirc;pta, that Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva disappeared from that place and propitiated twenty hundred kotis of Tath&acirc;gatas, &amp;c., all bearing the same name of Kandraprabh&acirc;svarar&acirc;ga, under all of whom he promulgated this Dharmapary&acirc;ya. By virtue of his previous root of goodness he, in course of time, propitiated twenty hundred thousand myriads of kotis of Tath&acirc;gatas, &amp;c., all bearing the name of Dundubhisvarar&acirc;ga, and under all he obtained this very Dharmapary&acirc;ya of the Lotus of the True Law and promulgated it to the four classes. By virtue of his previous root of goodness he again, in course of time, propitiated twenty hundred thousand myriads of kotis of Tath&acirc;gatas, &amp;c., all bearing the name of Meghasvarar&acirc;ga, and under all he obtained this very Dharmapary&acirc;ya of the Lotus of the True Law and promulgated it to the four classes. And under all of them he was possessed of the afore-mentioned perfectness of sight, hearing, smell, taste, body, and mind.</P>
<P>Now, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, that Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta, after having honoured, respected, esteemed, worshipped, venerated, revered so many hundred thousand myriads of kotis of Tath&acirc;gatas, and after having acted in the same way towards many hundred thousand myriads of kotis of other Buddhas, obtained under all of them this very Dharmapary&acirc;ya of the Lotus of the True Law, and owing to his former root of goodness having come to full development, gained supreme, perfect enlightenment. Perhaps, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, thou wilt have some doubt, uncertainty, or misgiving, and think that he who at that time, at that juncture was the Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva called Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta was one, and he who under the rule of that Lord Bhishmagargitasvarar&acirc;ga, the Tath&acirc;gata, &amp;c., was generally called Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta by the four classes, by whom so many Tath&acirc;gatas were propitiated, was another. But thou shouldst not think so. For it is myself who at that time, at that juncture was the Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta. Had I not formerly grasped and kept this Dharmapary&acirc;ya, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, I should not so soon have arrived at supreme, perfect enlightenment. It is because I have kept, read, preached this Dharmapary&acirc;ya (derived) from the teaching of the ancient Tath&acirc;gatas, &amp;c., Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, that I have so soon arrived at supreme, perfect enlightenment. As to the hundreds of monks, nuns, male and female lay devotees, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, to whom under that Lord the Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta promulgated this Dharmapary&acirc;ya by saying: I do not contemn you; you all observe the course of duty of Bodhisattvas; you are to become Tath&acirc;gatas, &amp;c., and in whom awoke a feeling of malignity towards that Bodhisattva, they in twenty hundred thousand myriads of kotis of .&AElig;ons never saw a Tath&acirc;gata, nor heard the call of the law, nor the call of the assembly, and for ten thousand &AElig;ons they suffered terrible pain in the great hell Av&icirc;ki. Thereafter released from the ban, they by the instrumentality of that Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva were all brought to full ripeness for supreme, perfect enlightenment. Perhaps, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;mapr&acirc;pta, thou wilt have some doubt, uncertainty, or misgiving as to who at that time, at that juncture were the persons hooting and laughing at the Bodhisattva Mah&acirc;sattva. They are, in this very assembly, the five hundred Bodhisattvas headed by Bhadrap&acirc;la, the five hundred nuns following Simhakandr&acirc;, the five hundred lay devotees following Sugataketan&acirc;,who all of them have been rendered inflexible in supreme, perfect enlightenment. So greatly useful it is to keep and preach this Dharmapary&acirc;ya, as it tends to result for Bodhisattvas Mah&acirc;sattvas in supreme, perfect enlightenment. Hence, Mah&acirc;sth&acirc;maprapta, the Bodhisattvas Mah&acirc;sattvas should, after the complete extinction of the Tath&acirc;gata, constantly keep, read, and promulgate this Dharmapary&acirc;ya.</P>
<P>And on that occasion the Lord uttered the following stanzas:</P>
<P>1. I remember a past period, when king Bh&icirc;shmasvara, the Gina, lived, very mighty, and revered by gods and men, the leader of men, gods, goblins, and giants.</P>
<P>2. At the time succeeding the complete extinction of that Gina, when the decay of the true law was far advanced, there was a monk, a Bodhisattva, called by the name of Sad&acirc;paribh&ucirc;ta.</P>
<P>3. Other monks and nuns who did not believe but in what they saw, he would approach (and say): I never am to contemn you, for you observe the course leading to supreme enlightenment.</P>
<P>4. It was his wont always to utter those words, which brought him but abuse and taunts from their part. At the time when his death was impending he heard this S&ucirc;tra.</P>
<P>5. The sage, then, did not expire; he resolved upon a very long life, and promulgated this S&ucirc;tra under the rule of that leader.</P>
<P>6. And those many (persons) who only acknowledged the evidence of sensual perception were by him brought to full ripeness for enlightenment. Then, disappearing from that place, he propitiated thousands of kotis of Buddhas.</P>
<P>7. Owing to the successive good actions performed by him, and to his constantly promulgating this S&ucirc;tra, that son of Gina reached enlightenment. That Bodhisattva then is myself, S&acirc;kyamuni.</P>
<P>8. And those persons who only believed in perception by the senses, those monks, nuns, male and female lay devotees who by the sage were admonished of enlightenment,</P>
<P>9. And who have seen many kotis of Buddhas, are the monks here before me,-no less than five hundred,-nuns, and female lay devotees.</P>
<P>10. All of them have been by me brought to complete ripeness, and after my extinction they will all, full of wisdom, keep this S&ucirc;tra.</P>
<P>11. Not once in many, inconceivably many kotis of &AElig;ons has such a S&ucirc;tra as this been heard. There are, indeed, hundreds of kotis of Buddhas, but they do not elucidate this S&ucirc;tra.</P>
<P>12. Therefore let one who has heard this law exposed by the Self-born himself, and who has repeatedly propitiated him, promulgate this S&ucirc;tra after my extinction in this world.</P>
