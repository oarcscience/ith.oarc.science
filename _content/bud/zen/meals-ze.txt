The Zen Buddhist texts listed below  have been translated from Japanese and rendered into
 a thoughtful English by the Diamond Sangha members, Honolulu, Hawaii headed by Robert 
Aitken Roshi. Although the basic work was done in the 1970s and the 1980s translations
 of some of the texts are not final as they tend to continue to be improved on and refined. 
These texts are used with gratitude and delight by members of several affiliated Zen
 centers and communities, including California Diamond Sangha, Santa Rosa and Berkeley,
 USA (headed by John Tarrant Roshi);  Sydney Zen Center, Australia, and the Zen Group 
of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.

[The final authoritative version of the sutras - as translated in Dec 1991 by Robert Aitken 
Roshi can be now found in the document called: diamond-sangha-zen-sutras.txt available
from the coombspapers at the above internet address.]

Buddha, born at Kapilavastu,
Attained the way at Magadha, preached at Varanasi,
Entered Nirvana at Kusinagara.
Now as we spread the bowls of Buddha Tathagatha
We make our vows together with all beings.
We and this food and our eating are vacant.

      Porridge is effective in ten ways
     To aid the student of Zen.
     No limit to the good result,
     Consumating eternal happiness.

***
     These three virtues and six flavours
     Are offered to the Buddha and Sangha
     May all beings of the universe
     Share alike this nourishment.

***

First, we consider in detail the merit of this food
and remember how it came to us;
Second, we evaluate our own virtue and practice,
lacking or complete, as we receive this offering;
Third, we are careful about greed, hatred and ignorance,
to guard our minds and to free ourselves from error;
Fourth, we take this good medicine to save our bodies
from emaciation;
Fifth, we accept this food to achieve the Way of the
Buddha.

***

()h, all you demons and spirits,
We now offer this food to you.
May all of you everywhere
Share it with us together.

***

The first portion is for the Three Treasures,
The second is for the Four Blessings;
The third is for the Six Paths;
Together with all we take this food.
The first taste is to cut off all evil,
The second is to practice all good,
The third is to save all beings;
May we all attain the Way of the Buddha.

We wash our bowls in this water,
It has the flavour of ambrosial dew.
We offer it to all demons and spirits;
May all be filled and satisfied.
OM  MAKULASAI  SVAHA

The world is like an empty sky,
The lotus does not adhere to water.
Our minds, surpassing that in purity,
We bow in veneratlon to thee most Exalted One.
