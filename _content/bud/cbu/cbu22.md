THE first fixing of the Buddhist canon was at the Councils of Rajagriha
and Pataliputra. The Northern and Southern Buddhists held together till
the Council of Pataliputra, under Ashôka. When an immense missionary
development followed on the meeting of this Council, the separation was
a natural result, because of the vast extent of country over which
Buddhism shortly became the prevalent religion.

The origin of the primitive Buddhist books which are Common to the
Northern and Southern Buddhists is, then, anterior to B.C. 246; and the
addition to the canon of the Mahayana books containing the legends of
Kwan-yin and of the Western heaven with its Buddha, Amitabha, was

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

also previous to the Council of Cashmere, a little before the beginning
of our era.

When the first books were translated into Chinese from Sanscrit, it was
before the time of the introduction of paper. Bamboo tablets were still
employed, and they were painted on with a brush. Paper-making soon came
into use, and in the fourth century the present system of Chinese
writing was fully in use. From that time till the invention of printing,
seven hundred years later, copies of the sacred books would be made from
time to time in the monasteries. As in countries where the palm grows
the monks have continued to write on the palm-leaf, so in China, till
printing was known, transcribed copies of all needed books would be made
and preserved in monasteries.

The library of the larger Buddhist monasteries consists of a complete
collection—presented by some former emperor—of the "books of the
religion" (*tsang-king*). The visitor will see them in eight or ten
large bookcases. In many instances they are preserved with great care
and are highly valued. Even if worm-eaten and injured by damp, the
priests always express unwillingness to part with any portions of them.
Though they seldom make use of this library themselves, they consider
that it would be an offence against the emperor to allow any of the
books it contains to be removed.

The preface to one of the last imperial editions is dated A.D. 1410, in
the *Yung-lo* period of the third emperor of the Ming dynasty. In
addition to the erection of the porcelain tower at Nanking, previous to
the removal of his residence from that place to Peking, he further
signalised his zeal for Buddhism by causing blocks to be cut for the
first time for the entire series of Buddhist books. They reached the
number of 6771 *kiuen* or "sections." A little more than three-fourths
of this extensive literature consists of translations from Sanscrit.
According to a rough calculation, the whole work of the Hindoo
translators in China, together with that of Hiuen-tsang the

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

traveller, amounts to about seven hundred times the size of the New
Testament in Chinese form. In this estimate lost translations, which are
numerous, are not included.

One of these works, the *Maha Prajna paramita* (*Ta-poh-je-king*),
consists of a hundred and twenty volumes. It is perhaps the most
extensive single book ever translated in any age or country, being about
eighty times as large as the New Testament. The celebrated Chinese
translator, Hiuen-tsang, was engaged on it four years.

The edition of Buddhist books printed in the period Yung-lo is called
*Nan-tsang*, the "Southern collection." There was another made in the
time of Wan-li in the closing part of the sixteenth century. The
imperial residence having been already removed from Nanking to Peking,
this edition was called the *Pei-tsang* or "Northern collection."

A new set of blocks was cut at the expense of private persons from this
last, by a priest called Tsï-pe to-shï, not many years after. They were
placed in the Leng-yen monastery at Kia-hing near Hang-chew, and were
still there before the T‘ai-ping rebellion.

In 1723, a former governor of Che-kiang repaired the blocks, and wrote a
preface to a catalogue of these books under the title of
*Pei-tsang-mu-lu*. It contains a reprint of the imperial preface to the
first complete edition dating in the seventh century (T‘ang
Chung-tsung). This document alludes to the labours of the successive
translators, and dwells especially on the adventures of Hiuen-tsang who
had recently returned from his twenty years’ travels in India, and had
come to be regarded, on account of his successful journey and literary
labours, as the most remarkable of all the Chinese Buddhists.

The primary division of the Buddhist books is into three parts, *King*,
*Lü*, *Lun*, or "Sutra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma." The first contains the
immediate instructions of Buddha on dogma. It details those present as
listeners,

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

any remarkable circumstances that occurred, the conversations that took
place between Buddha and any of his audience, and the direct
instructions that he communicated to them. The Vinaya relates the
discipline appointed by Buddha for his followers, and the circumstances
that led to the establishment of particular rules and observances. The
scene, audience, and conversations are detailed much in the manner of
the Sutras or works of the first class. The word *king* is indeed often
applied to works that are placed in the Vinaya division. The third part,
Abhidharma, consists of discussions, in many instances by known authors,
on the Buddhist creed and on heresies. They are not then like the works
found in the first and second classes, necessarily spoken—according to
Buddhist faith—by Shakyamuni; but include many that were written, in the
first centuries after his death, by the more distinguished of his
followers.

After Buddha's entrance into the Nirvâna, we are told his disciples met
to agree on the books that should be regarded as the true traditions of
their master's instructions. Kashiapa assembled them at the mountain
*Gi-ja-ku-ta* (Gridhrakuta). They came there by the exercise of
miraculous power. Ananda, who was young, had not yet attained to the
rank of Arhan when the meeting began, but just at this time he was
raised to the necessary elevation and took his seat with the rest.
Kashiapa then said: "The 'Bikshu Ananda' (*O-nan Pi-Neu*) has great
wisdom. Like a vessel receiving water, he imbibed the doctrine of
Buddha, retaining no more and no less than what the teacher uttered. Let
him be invited to compile the *Sutra Pitaka* (Collection of the king or
discourses of Shakyamuni)." The assembly remained silent. Kashiapa then
addressed Ananda: "It is for you now to promulgate the 'eye of the
doctrine' (*fa-yen*)." Ananda assented, and after observing the
countenances of the audience, said: "Bikshus and all here present.
Without Buddha nothing is noble or beautiful, as in the expanse

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

above, the stars cannot spare the moon." He then bowed to the assembly,
and ascended the rostrum. He began: "Thus have I heard—At a certain
time, when Buddha was a certain place, he delivered such instructions."
In each instance Kashiapa asked the Bikshus if such were really the
words of Buddha, and they all replied, "They were just these
words." <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109)

A similar account is retained by the Singhalese of the origin of the
Sutras. <span id="fr_110"></span>[2](#fn_110) The Vinaya division of the
books was, according to their traditions, prepared by Upali, and the
Shastras or Abhidharma by Kashiapa.

So far as this threefold arrangement of the books, the Northern and
Southern Buddhists are at one. But for the literature of the North a
further division must now be noticed. The distinction of *Mahayana*
(*Ta-ch’eng*), or "Great Development," and *Hinayana* (*Siau-ch’eng*),
or "Lesser Development," runs through the works of all the three classes
above described. The works of the "Lesser Development" (or vehicle)
there can be little doubt are the original books of Buddha, for their
dogmas and legends agree with the religion as it is still professed in
Ceylon and by all the Southern Buddhists. The Mahayana is, on the other
hand, unknown there. Burnouf attributes the books of the Lesser
Development to the first Buddhist council already described, and those
of the Greater Development to another held a little more than four
hundred years after Shakyamuni's death. It is his opinion that the
Mahayana books were composed in Cashmere, in the reign of
Kanishka, <span id="fr_111"></span>[3](#fn_111) a king of Northern India
(Cabul). A council—the third or fourth—was then called to decide what
books should be canonical, and it was then that these extensive
additions to the *Tripitaka* or "Three collections" were agreed upon.
The same learned writer

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

interposes another council a hundred and ten years after the first, in
the reign of Ashôka also called Piyadasi. This prince, from his
extensive empire and his patronage of Buddhism, is called a wheel-king,
*i.e.*, a Buddhist king to whom the world is subject, and who causes the
wheel of the holy doctrine to be kept turning.

There need be no hesitation in adopting Burnouf's view, for we know the
names and many of the writings of influential Buddhists who lived at the
time and place indicated, and whose opinions and qualifications were
such as to render them fitted for the authorship of the *Ta-ch’eng* or
"Mahayana" books, and much presumptive evidence of the fact will be
found to exist.

Among them were—(1.) *Ma-ming*, or "Ashwagosha," the twelfth patriarch,
who wrote *K‘i-sin-lun*, the "Shastra for awakening faith." <span
id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112) (2.) *Lung-shu*, or "Nagarjuna," the
fourteenth patriarch, author of *Vibhasha-lun*, *Chung-lun*,
*Ta-chï-tu-lun*, *Prajna-teng-lun*, *Shï-er-men-lun*, and several other
works, including the most venerated of all the Buddhist books in China,
the *Hwa-yen-king*. (3.) *T‘ien-ts‘in*, or "Vasubandu." It is said of
him, that when he first became a monk he was a bitter enemy of the
Mahayana books, and destroyed them whenever he had opportunity. By the
influence of his elder brother Asengha, <span
id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_113) he was brought to change his views. His
remorse was such that he would have wrenched out his tongue, but Asengha
said to him, "as he had formerly used his tongue to revile the Great
Development books, he should now employ it to praise them. This would be
an expiation for his fault." After this he wrote more than a hundred
works, which were placed in the third division of the sacred
books. <span id="fr_114"></span>[3](#fn_114)

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

(4.) *Wu-cho*, or "Asengha," brother of the last. (5.) *Hu-fa*, or
"Dharmapara" (Protector of the law). He was born in the Dravida country
in South India. He wrote the Shastra *Ch‘eng-wei-shï-lun*. (6.)
Maitreya. (7.) Deva. (8.) Sheng-t‘ien. These and one or two more are
mentioned among the authors of Shastras. All these persons are dignified
with the name of Bodhisattwa.

The authorship of the *Hwa-yen-king* may be ascribed to Lung-shu, on the
ground that he is said in a Chinese preface to have discovered it in the
"Dragon palace," and first promulgated it as one of the Mahayana Sutras,
or books of the "Great vehicle." He could not prefix his name to it as
to works of the third division, because it is essential to a Sutra that
it be a discourse of Buddha. In conformity with this principle, the
Great Development "Sutras," or as they are called in Chinese *King*, are
by a fiction ascribed to Shakyamuni, though their real authors were, as
there is every reason to suppose, the acute-minded Hindoos whose names
have just been given.

Two principal divisions of the Buddhist books, in reference to the time
of their composition, are thus obtained. The former belonging to the
fifth century B.C. contain, among other things, the monastic
institutions, the moral code, the ascetic life, the metempsychosis, and
the Nirvâna, of which the first two are Buddhist, and the latter three
common to the native religions of India. The whole is interwoven with
the fantastic notions of the Hindoos on geography, astronomy, and
supernatural beings.

The second division embraces later developments in metaphysics and
cosmogony. In the *Prajna paramita*, through a hundred and twenty
volumes, the favourite dogma of extreme idealism, the non-existence of
mind and matter in all their forms, is reiterated to satiety. In the
legends of the Eastern and Western paradise—that of Ach‘obhya and that
of Amitabha—and regarding the formation of various other vast worlds and
powerful divinities, the new mythological tendencies of this system

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

are exhibited. These books must be assigned to about the first century
B.C.

By help of the catalogue of Buddhist books published A.D. 730
(*K‘ai-yuen-shi-kiau-lu*), the earliest and most noted translators may
be divided between these two schools. Works of the *Siau-ch‘eng* or
"Lesser Development," *i.e.*, primitive Buddhism, were introduced by the
following persons:—

To assist in numbering and distinguishing the books belonging to the
great threefold collection, the characters contained in the "Book of a
Thousand Characters" (*Tsien-tsï-wen*) are made use of.

The first subdivision of the "Sutras" or *King* under the heading,
*Ta-ch’eng*, "Great Development," is that of "Prajna" (*Po-je*). It
contains the work *Maha-prajna-paramita* in six hundred chapters, to
mark which, sixty characters from the "Thousand Character Classic" are
employed. Eighteen other works are placed in the same subdivision.

These are followed by books containing the legends of Amitabha and
Ach‘obhya, the Western and Eastern Buddhas. These, with others, compose
the *Pau-tsi* subdivision. After this comes that called *Ta-tsi*, or
"Great Collection." Then succeed those called *Hwa-yen*, so named from
the common book of that title in eighty chapters. The fifth comprises
books on the Nirvâna. After these five chief subdivisions are arranged
the names of many others, whether translated once or oftener. With the
preceding they make in all five hundred and thirty-six Sutras of the
Great Development class.

Of the Smaller Development school two hundred and twenty-eight works are
contained in the collection, the chief of them belonging to the *Agama*
subdivision. There were added in the Sung and Yuen dynasties three
hundred altogether. Their names follow in the catalogue.

Many of these works are very small, ten or more being often placed
together under one letter.

Under the denomination "Vinaya" or *Lü*, "Discipline," twenty-five works
belong to the Great Development school, while fifty-nine are assigned to
the *Siau-ch’eng* department.

Among the works belonging to the third class, "Abhidharma" or *Lun*, are
ninety-three of the Great Development school, and thirty-seven of the
Lesser. To these twenty-three were added in the Sung and Yuen dynasties.

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

After this occur works by various Western authors, in number
ninety-seven, which do not admit of being classed with those that
precede. Many of these consist of liturgical regulations and biographies
of Hindoo Buddhists.

At the end of the collection are placed works by Chinese authors, in all
a hundred and ninety-six. These consist of commentaries, biographical
works, cyclopædias, travels in Buddhist countries, apologetic treatises,
liturgical works, and the original works of authors belonging to the
various native schools of Buddhism. Of these forty were appended in the
Ming dynasty—as in all such cases—by imperial order.

These numbers give a total of about sixteen hundred separate works, of
which fourteen hundred are translations from Sanscrit. Several hundred
others are lost.

Many productions of less importance, probably amounting to several
hundreds in number, by native authors, are commonly read. In an estimate
of the extent of Chinese Buddhist literature these should be included.
They consist of popular treatises, with anecdotes of the power of the
Buddhas and Bodhisattwas, and the benefits of chanting the sacred books.
Woodcuts are much used in these books, illustrative of the Buddhist
future state, of Shakyamuni instructing his disciples, and of the Hindoo
cosmogony and geography. Descriptions of remarkable monasteries and
sacred places, and many works on the various schools of this religion in
China, should be added to the list.

I place here some remarks on the councils held by the early Buddhists.

Professor Max Müller says: "The Northern Buddhists know but one Ashôka,
the grandson of Chandragupta, and but one council held in his reign,
viz., the Council of Pataliputra, under Dharmashôka, and this they place
a hundred and ten years after Buddha's death."

The Singhalese Buddhists speak of two Ashôkas, viz.,

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kalashôka and
Dharmashôka. Twelve kings intervened between them. A council was held
under each Ashôka.

If we admit the last, it must have taken place either B.C. 242 or B.C.
246 at Pataliputra.

The fourth council, under Kanishka, presided over by Vasumitra, was
probably a little before the Christian era. Nagarjuna's works and system
were recognised, and from this time the "Great Development" spread among
all the Northern Buddhists.

The attention of the student of Buddhism may be directed especially to
those works in the *San-tsang*, or "Three pitaka," of which translations
have been made.

Of these the most elaborate is that of the *Fa-hwa-king*, "Lotus of the
Good Law," by Eugene Burnouf. It is rendered from the Sanscrit, and
illustrated by a vast body of notes.

On comparing it with the Chinese version of Kumarajiva, I found
considerable lacunæ in the Chinese copy. Kumarajiva came under the
influence of the Chinese literati, to whom the ponderous verbosity and
extensive repetitions of the original were intolerable. He wisely cut it
down, and made a much shorter book of it. Burnouf would have been wise
to do so too.

The small books with a prominent moral element are extremely
interesting. Some of these are translated by Mr. Beal in his *Catena*.

The "Book of Forty-two Sections" was translated from Sanscrit by the
first Hindoo missionaries. An edition in five volumes, with very full
notes, by Sü Fa, and published a century and a half ago, is a signal
example of the industry and fulness of illustration and comment of a
Chinese scholar when editing an ancient book.

In this and other small but interesting works may be seen the principles
of primitive Buddhism as taught by Shakyamuni.

The monastic life is here portrayed, and the duties of those who entered
upon it are clearly pointed out.

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

But though vows of celibacy, and living in society with fellow-believers
in the Buddhist doctrine, or in solitude in woods and caves, were
recommended by Shakyamuni as the most suitable mode of carrying out his
system, he did not make them absolutely essential. In the "Wei-ma
Sutra," *Vimakita* (*Wei-mo-kie*), a layman native of Vaishali, living
in society, is represented as having made great progress in the
knowledge of the principles of Buddhism. He is contrasted with many who
had taken the vows, but were far inferior to him. "Manjusiri" (*Wen-shu
p‘u-sa*) and Vimakita are held up as equally good models of Buddhist
excellence: the one, as to form, being without a rival in the monastic
society; the other, as to action, being the most advanced student of the
Buddhist law outside the circle of those who had taken the vows.

Many of the Buddhist books are valuable, on account of the stories
illustrative of ancient life which they contain.

The following story of travellers killing a guide, to sacrifice to the
Devas of a certain place, reminds the reader irresistibly of the
narrative of Jonah.

“A company of merchants undertaking a journey selected a guide. With him
they set out across an uninhabited region. On the way they arrived at a
temple to the Devas, at which it was the custom, that a man must be
sacrificed before the travellers could pass on.

“They consulted as to what should be done, and said one to another: 'We
are all friends, neighbours, and relations. None of us can be
sacrificed. Only the guide can be.' When they had put him to death and
finished the offering, they proceeded and lost their way. Weary and
brokenhearted, all one by one died.

"So it is with men. They wish to enter the sea of doctrine in order to
get the pearls hidden in its depths. They must take virtue for their
guide. If they slander and destroy virtue they will be sure to lose
their way, and never emerge from the desert of life and death. Their
sufferings must last for long ages."

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

A story of the shadow of gold in water is told to illustrate how
ignorant men seek for golden doctrine in places where they will never
find it. The story says that "formerly a foolish man went to a lake and
saw at the bottom of the water a shadow of what seemed true gold. He
called out, 'Here is gold.' He then went into the water and sought it in
vain till he was tired and the water grew muddy. He sat down and waited
till the water was clear, when he saw it again, and once more he tried
fruitlessly to get it. At last the father came to look for his son, and
asked him why he was so weary. On learning, he said, after seeing the
shadow, 'This gold is on the tree above. A bird must have taken it in
his beak and placed it there.' The son climbed the tree and found it."

To illustrate the difficulty of creating, a story is told against the
Brahmans, who ascribe creation to Brahma. They call him Maha Brahma
Deva, and say that he is the father of the world, and can create all
things. The story states that "this so-called creator had a disciple who
said he could create all things. He was foolish, but thought himself
wise. He said one day to Brahma, 'I desire to create all things.' Brahma
replied, 'Do not think of it. You cannot create. Without being able to
use the language of the Devas, you have the desire to create things.'
Brahma saw what his disciple had made, and noticed that the head was too
large and the crown too small, or the hand too large and the arm too
small, or the foot too large and the leg too small. In fact, it was like
the Pishâcha demons." <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115)

"We thus learn," continues the narrator, "that what every one brings
into existence is not the creation of Brahma."

THE STORY OF THE BRAHMAN WHO KILLED HIS SON.

"Once there was a Brahman, who, according to his own statement, was
extremely wise, and knew all the arts of

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

astrologers and jugglers. Wishing to show his powers he went to another
country, carrying his son in his arms, and weeping. When asked, 'Why do
you weep?' he replied, This young child is to die in seven days. I mourn
over his short life.' The people of the country remarked, 'It is hard to
know when men will die. It is easy to err in such calculations. Wait
till the seven days are past, and perhaps he will not die. Why weep
now?' The Brahman answered, 'The sun and moon may be darkened, the stars
may fall, but what I have said cannot fail of fulfilment.' On the
seventh day, for the sake of fame and profit, the Brahman killed his son
to confirm the truth of his own words. When men heard that the Brahman's
son was dead precisely seven days after the time of the prediction, they
all admired the wisdom of the Brahman, whose words proved true, and came
to listen to his instructions. It is so among the four classes of
Buddha's disciples, with those who for gain say they have attained
eminent enlightenment. By their foolish doctrine they destroy the son of
the good, falsely assume a benevolent character, and must in consequence
endure much suffering. They resemble the Brahman who killed his son."

The book proceeds to speak of the Buddhas and their teaching. They are
not liable to the errors of such men. The Buddhas in giving instruction
keep a middle path, without encroachment on either side. They are
neither too constant on the one hand, nor are they too interrupted and
inconstant on the other. There is in their actions and teaching no
disproportion. Various pretenders, however, try to imitate them, and
fall into the errors of boasting, lying, and extravagance. Men, in
exhibiting the form of the law, fail to present to view the true law.

These extracts are taken from the "Book of a Hundred Parables,"
*Pe-yü-king*, chapter ii., translated by Gunabidi.

There is a book of moral instructions, arranged in the form of the
*Gâtha*, with headings, such as teaching, conversation, mercy, &c. It is
called *Fa-kü-king*, "Book of

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

the Dharma in Sentences." There are five hundred of these sentences. In
India every student read this book at the beginning of his course. If he
did not read this among the many books of his religion, he omitted the
preface.

The sentences are of the following nature:—When rising in the morning
you should think, "My life will not last long. It is like the vessel of
the potter, easily broken. He who dies does not return." On this is
grounded an appeal to men to learn Buddha's law.

It was translated from the work of *Tau-lio* by Kumarajiva. There are
some other works specially devoted to fables and parables, such as
*Tsa-yü-king*, "Book of Miscellaneous Parables."

Among works specially deserving attention is *Fan-wang-king*. This book
on the "Discipline" or *Vinaya*, is the Brahmajala, "Net of Brahma."

Mr. Gogerly, in the *Ceylon Friend*, published a brief translation of
the work. See Beal in *Second Congress of Orientalists*, p. 134. It
states the rules which guide the Bodhisattwa.

The Chinese *Fo-pen-hing-tsi-king* is in Sanscrit "Abhinishkramana
Sûtra." It has been translated by Beal, who thinks the narratives it
contains will explain the "Sanchi topes," the inscriptions on which are
hard to identify in any books. It is a life of Buddha, with many
episodes, which may also illustrate the inscriptions at Bharhut,
Amravati, &c.

Mr. Beal finds in the *Chan-tsï-king* the "Sâma Jâtaka," which contains
part of the story of Dasaratha and Rama, and refers to an allusion in
the travels of Fa-hien, to a festival in Ceylon, which may have light
thrown on it by this book.

Sâma was Shakyamuni Buddha in a former life, living in a forest with his
father and mother, who were blind. He fed them with fruits, fetched
water for them, and was

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

beloved by the deer and other wild animals of the woods. At last the
king came on a hunting expedition, shot an arrow into a large herd of
(leer by the water side, and killed Sâma with it, who happened to be in
the middle of the herd. Sâma died, and the king was most penitent, while
the parents wept over their son. The gods seeing this sad spectacle—the
parents lamenting over their son, and the sympathising Raja—came and
restored him to life.

The work *Pratimoksha* is mentioned in the last instructions of Buddha.
It contains the rules of discipline for the disciples of Buddha. He left
this, when dying, in the hands of his followers, as their guide for holy
conduct.

A translation of the first chapter of the *Leng-yen-king* and of a short
Shastra here follow.

The *Leng-yen-king* is praised by Chu Hi and other Confucianists as the
best worth reading of the Buddhist sacred books.
