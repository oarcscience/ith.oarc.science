<p>1. At that time the Blessed One was staying at <I>G</I>etavana, in the grove of An&acirc;tha-pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ika.</p>

<p>your adversaries are) and do not you be afraid of them. We too will be on your side.' Thereby both disputes arose which had not arisen before; and disputes which had arisen grew hotter.</p>  
<p>2. Those Bhikkhus who were modest were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, How can the Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>uka and of Lohitaka act thus.' And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened an assembly of the Order of Bhikkhus, and inquired of the Bhikkhus: 'Is it true, as they say, Bhikkhus, that those Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>uka and Lohitaka,--who themselves (&amp;c., as in &sect; 1, down to the end)?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord!'</p>  
<p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'This is improper, O Bhikkhus, for those foolish persons, not according to rule, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama<I>n</I>a, unbecoming, and ought not to be done. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, who themselves (&amp;c., as in &sect; 1, down to the end). This will not conduce, O Bhikkhus, either to the conversion of the unconverted, or to the increase of the converted; but rather to those who have not been converted being not converted, and to the turning back of those who have been converted.'</p>  
<p>3. And when the Blessed One had rebuked those Bhikkhus in various ways,--speaking of the evils of being hard to satisfy in the matter of support or nourishment, of wishing for much, of discontent, of love of society, and of sloth; and speaking in praise of being easy to satisfy in the matter of support and nourishment, of wishing for little, of the</p>

<p>4. 'Now thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be carried out. In the first place the Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>uka and Lohitaka ought to be warned; when they have been warned, they ought to be reminded (of the Rule in the P&acirc;timokkha against which they have offended); when they have been reminded, they ought to be charged with the (particular) offence; when they have been charged with the offence, some discreet and able Bhikkhu ought to lay the matter before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, saying,</p>
