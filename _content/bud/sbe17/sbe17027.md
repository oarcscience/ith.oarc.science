### 13.

1\. Now at that time the venerable Pilindava*kkh*a had head-ache <span
id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_130).

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a little oil on the head.'

(The disease) became no better <span id="fr_133"></span>[3](#fn_131).

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the practice of taking up (medicine) through the
nose <span id="fr_134"></span>[4](#fn_132).'

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

The nose ran.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a nose-spoon <span
id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_133).'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus had various kinds of
nose-spoons--made of gold, and of silver. People were annoyed, murmured,
and became angry, saying, 'Like those who still live in the world.'

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'Various kinds of nose-spoons, O Bhikkhus, are not to be used. Whosoever
does so, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence. I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use
of such nose-spoons made of bone (&c., as in chap. 12. 1, down to:) or
of the chank-shell.'

2\. The nose took up the medicament in unequal proportions.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a double nose-spoon <span
id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_134).'

(The disease) became no better.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sniff up the aroma.'

They used to spread the drugs on a wick before they sniffed up the
aroma <span id="fr_137"></span>[3](#fn_135): and their throats got
burnt.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a pipe to conduct the aroma.'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus had various kinds of pipes
(&c., as in the last clauses of § 1, down to the end).

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

Now at that time the aroma-pipes came open: and worms got in.

I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a lid to the pipes.'

Now at that time the Bhikkhus carried the pipes about in their hands.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a bag to carry the aroma-pipes in.'

The aroma-pipes rubbed against one another.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a double bag.'

They had no shoulder strap.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a shoulder strap (by which to carry the
double bag), or of a thread (by which to sew it on).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_130"></span>[53:2](sbe17027.htm#fr_132) Sîsâbhitâpo,
literally 'heat in the head.'

<span id="fn_131"></span>[53:3](sbe17027.htm#fr_133) Compare
Mahâ-parinibbâna Sutta II, 31, and below, 13. 2; 14. 3.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[53:4](sbe17027.htm#fr_134) Natthu-kamma. In
the commentary on the Dhammapada, pp. 83 and foll., there is an example
of the way in which a physician administers medicinal oil in this manner
to a sick Bhikkhu.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[54:1](sbe17027.htm#fr_135) Natthu-kara*n*î,
that is, an instrument to hold up the nose, so that the medicinal oil
does not run out.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[54:2](sbe17027.htm#fr_136)
Yamaka-natthu-kara*n*î, that is, one that would go up both nostrils. The
last sentence of § 1 would come in better after this clause.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[54:3](sbe17027.htm#fr_137) They used to burn
the drugs by smearing them on wicks, and then inhale the smoke through
their nostrils.
