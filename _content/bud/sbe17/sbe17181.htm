<P><A NAME="fn_729"></A><A HREF="sbe17181.htm#fr_751">421:1</A> Parim&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;, the meaning of which is open to much doubt. The Samanta P&acirc;s&acirc;dik&acirc; merely says, Antar&acirc; sambahul&acirc; &acirc;pattiyo &acirc;pa<I>g</I><I>g</I>ati parim&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc; pa<I>t</I>i<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ann&acirc;yo ti &acirc;disu &acirc;patti-pari<I>k</I><I>kh</I>edavase parim&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;yo <I>k</I>&#8217; eva appa<I>t</I>i<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ann&acirc;yo <I>k</I>&acirc; &#8217;ti attho. The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the word is acc. fem. plur., and not an adverb. Compare chap. 33, below.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_730"></A><A HREF="sbe17181.htm#fr_752">421:2</A> The text has a full paragraph for each of these cases.</P>
