1\. Now at that time the venerable Bela*tth*asîsa, the superior of the
venerable Ânanda, had a disease of thick scabs; and by reason of the
discharge thereof his robes stuck to his body. The Bhikkhus moistened
those robes with water, and loosened them (from his body).

The Blessed One, as he was going on his rounds through the
sleeping-places, saw them \[doing so\], and going up to the place where
they were, he asked them:

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

'What is the matter, O Bhikkhus, with this Bhikkhu?'

'The venerable one has the disease of thick scabs; and by reason of the
discharge thereof his robes stick to his body. So we are moistening
those robes thoroughly with water, to loosen them (from his body).'

2\. Then the Blessed One on that occasion, after having delivered a
religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, to whomsoever has the itch, or boils, or a
discharge, or scabs, the use of an itch-cloth <span
