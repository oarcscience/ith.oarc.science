decoctions as medicine. They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of astringent decoctions as
medicine--the nimba <span id="fr_89"></span>[2](sbe17019.htm#fn_88), the
ku*t*aga <span id="fr_90"></span>[3](sbe17019.htm#fn_89), the
pakkava <span id="fr_91"></span>[4](sbe17019.htm#fn_90), the
nattamâla <span id="fr_92"></span>[5](sbe17019.htm#fn_91), and
whatsoever other astringent roots are used for medicine, which impart an
appetising flavour to foods, either hard or soft, which the sick
Bhikkhus could not otherwise eat. They may be received, and stored up
your life long; and, if there be necessity, they may be. eaten. If eaten
without necessity, (the Bhikkhu who uses them) is guilty of a dukka*t*a
offence.'
