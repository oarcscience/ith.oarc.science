<p>1. Now at that time the country people loaded much salt, and oil, and rice, and hard food on their carts, and making a laager in the outer enclosure of the &Acirc;r&acirc;ma, they waited there, saying, 'When it comes to our turn, we will provide a meal.' And a great storm-cloud arose. Then those people went to the place where the venerable &Acirc;nanda was; and when they had come there they said to the venerable &Acirc;nanda: 'We loaded a quantity of salt, and oil, and rice, and hard food on to our carts; and they stand there. Now a great storm-cloud has arisen. What are we now, &Acirc;nanda, Sir, to do with them?'</p>  
<p>Then the venerable &Acirc;nanda told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>2. 'In that case, &Acirc;nanda, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha decide upon some outside building as a kappiyabh&ucirc;mi (that is to say, a site, outside the actual dwelling, in which provisions can be kept or cooked without breaking the rule laid down in the last chapter) and keep the stores there (in a building) of any shape the Sa<I>m</I>gha chooses, such as vih&acirc;ra, a<I>d</I><I>dh</I>ayoga, p&acirc;s&acirc;da, hammiya, guh&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'And thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be resolved upon. A discreet and able Bhikkhu should proclaim the following <I>&ntilde;</I>atti before the Sa<I>m</I>gha: "Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Sirs, hear me. If the Sa<I>m</I>gha is ready, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha appoint the Vih&acirc;ra called N. N. to be our kappiya-bh&ucirc;mi. This is the <I>&ntilde;</I>atti. Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Sirs, hear me.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The Sa<I>m</I>gha appoints the Vih&acirc;ra called N. N. to be our kappiya-bh&ucirc;mi. Let any one of the venerable brethren who is in favour of appointing the Vih&acirc;ra (&amp;c., down to:) thus I understand."'</p>  
<p>3. Now at that time men in that place--the kappiya-bh&ucirc;mi duly chosen by resolution (of the Sa<I>m</I>gha)--boiled congey, and boiled rice, and mixed curries, and cut up meat, and split fire-wood. And when the Blessed One, as the night was passing away, rose up, he heard a great and loud noise, as of the cawing of crows. On hearing this he asked the venerable &Acirc;nanda: 'What now, &Acirc;nanda, may be this great and loud noise, as of the cawing of crows?'</p>  
<p>4. 'In that place, Lord,--the kappiya-bh&ucirc;mi duly chosen by resolution (of the Sa<I>m</I>gha),--men are now boiling congey, and boiling rice, and mixing curries, and cutting up meat, and splitting fire-wood. Thence, Lord, comes that great and loud noise, as of the cawing of crows.'</p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One, in that connection, and on that account, after he had delivered a religious discourse, said to the Bhikkhus</p>  
<p>'A kappiya-bh&ucirc;mi, O Bhikkhus, duly chosen, is not to be made use of. Whosoever shall so use it, is guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a offence. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a kappiya-bh&ucirc;mi of three kinds, one that has become so by means of a proclamation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,</p>

<p>an ox-stall&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and a building belonging to laymen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>5. Now at that time the venerable Yaso<I>g</I>a was sick, and drugs were brought for his use, and these the Bhikkhus put out of doors. Vermin ate them, and thieves carried them away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use a duly chosen kappiya-bh&ucirc;mi (to keep drugs in). I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a kappiya-bh&ucirc;mi of four kinds, one that has become so by means of a proclamation, an ox-stall, a building belonging to laymen, and a duly chosen one.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_218"></A><A HREF="sbe17047.htm#fr_222">119:1</A> On these five kinds of buildings, see above, I, 30, 4; II, 8, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_219"></A><A HREF="sbe17047.htm#fr_223">120:1</A> Buddhaghosa says on this word: 'When a Vih&acirc;ra is to be erected on piles, or the foundations of its walls are to be dug out, and the stones on which it is to rest are already laid, then when the first pile or the first stone of the walls is put upon them, the men standing round in a body proclaim, "Let us make a kappiyaku<I>t</I>&icirc;."' The proclamation cannot be made after the building has got further than the actual stage here described. Uss&acirc;van&acirc; is <A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A> therefore from uss&acirc;veti, 'to proclaim;' and antika is used here, as below in VII, 1, 7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_220"></A><A HREF="sbe17047.htm#fr_224">121:1</A> Gonis&acirc;dika. Compare Buddhaghosa's explanation of gonis&acirc;di-nivi<I>t</I><I>th</I>o g&acirc;mo at Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga, P&acirc;r. II, 3, as given by Minayeff, 'Pr&acirc;timoksha,' p. 66, lines 7, 8. Here Buddhaghosa says simply, 'There are two kinds of ox-stalls; &acirc;r&acirc;ma ox-stalls and vih&acirc;ra ox-stalls. Of these, when neither the &acirc;r&acirc;ma nor the dwellings are fenced in (parikkhitt&acirc;ni honti), that is an &acirc;r&acirc;ma ox-stall; when all or some of the dwellings are fenced in, and not the &acirc;r&acirc;ma, that is a vih&acirc;ra ox-stall. So both kinds depend upon the fencing in of the &acirc;r&acirc;ma.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_221"></A><A HREF="sbe17047.htm#fr_225">121:2</A> This seems to mean that stores could be kept for the Sa<I>m</I>gha on laymen's premises.</P>
