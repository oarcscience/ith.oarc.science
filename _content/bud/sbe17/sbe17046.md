### 32.

1\. Now at that time Vesâlî was well provided with food, the harvest was
good, alms were easy to obtain, one could very well get a living <span
id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_215) by gleaning, or through favour.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

And when the Blessed One had retired into solitude this consideration
presented itself to his mind: 'The things which I have prescribed for
the Bhikkhus in a time of scarcity, when the harvest is bad, and alms
are difficult to obtain--keeping food indoors, cooking it indoors,
cooking it of one's own accord, taking what they can pick up, eating
food brought from within, or received before meal-time, eating things
found in woods or in pools <span id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_216), those
things the Bhikkhus enjoy also now.'

And the Blessed One, in the evening, when he had left his solitude, said
to the venerable Ânanda: 'The things which (&c., as above, down to:) or
in pools--do the Bhikkhus enjoy those things now also?'

'They enjoy them, Lord.'

2\. Then the Blessed One, in that connection, and on that account, after
having delivered a religious discourse, said to the Bhikkhus:

'The things which I have prescribed (&c., as in § 1, down to:) or in
pools--those I do not allow from this day forth. You are not, O
Bhikkhus, to eat food kept indoors, or cooked indoors, or cooked of your
own accord; nor to take things (to eat) which you have picked up.
Whosoever shall do so, is guilty of a dukka*t*a offence. And you are
not, O Bhikkhus--after you have once finished eating, and have refused
food still offered--to eat food brought from within, or received before
meal-time, or found in the woods or pools, even if it be food which is
not the leavings of the meal of one who has eaten on invitation.
Whosoever shall so eat, shall be dealt with according to law <span
id="fr_221"></span>[2](#fn_217).'
