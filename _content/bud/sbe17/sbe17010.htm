<p>1. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Bhaddiya as long as he thought fit, he set out on a journey towards S&acirc;vatthi. And walking from place to place he arrived at S&acirc;vatthi. There the Blessed One dwelt at S&acirc;vatthi at the <I>G</I>etavana, An&acirc;tha-pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ika's Grove.</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to catch hold of the heifers crossing on the A<I>k</I>iravat&icirc; River by their horns, or ears, or dewlaps, or tails&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, or spring up upon their backs, or touch with lustful</p>

<p>thoughts their privy parts: and they used to duck the young calves and so kill them. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<I>n</I>as [act thus]? it is like men still enjoying the pleasures of the world.'</p>  
<p>And Bhikkhus heard them murmuring in annoyance and indignation: and those Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Is it true' (&amp;c., see chap. 4. 2)?</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
<p>He rebuked them, and having delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
<p align="justify'">'Heifers are not to be caught hold of, O Bhikkhus, by their horns, or their ears, or their dewlaps, or their tails. You are not to get up on their backs. Whosoever gets up on their backs, is guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a offence. And their privy parts, O Bhikkhus, are not to be touched with lustful thoughts. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a thulla<I>k</I><I>k</I>aya offence. And calves ought not to be killed. Whosoever kills them, let him be dealt with according to law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>

<p>'Do not have yourselves carried in vehicles, O Bhikkhus. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a offence.'</p>
