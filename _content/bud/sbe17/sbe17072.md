### 5.

1\. At that time people went to the Ârâma with robes <span

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhikkhus). They
found there no Bhikkhu who was to receive the robes; so they took them
back again. (In consequence of that) few robes were given (to the
Bhikkhus).

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you appoint a Bhikkhu possessed of the
following five qualities, to receive the robes (presented to the
Bhikkhus): (a person) who does not go in the evil course of lust, in the
evil course of hatred, in the evil course of delusion, in the evil
course of fear, and who knows what has been received and what has not.

2\. 'And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to appoint (such a Bhikkhu) in this way:
First, that Bhikkhu must be asked (to accept that commission). When he
has been asked, let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following
*ñ*atti before the Sa*m*gha: "Let the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear me.
If the Sa*m*gha is ready, let the Sa*m*gha appoint the Bhikkhu N. N: to
receive the robes (presented to the Bhikkhus). This is the *ñ*atti. Let
the Sa*m*gha, reverend Sirs, hear me. The Sa*m*gha appoints the Bhikkhu
N. N. to receive the robes (presented). Let any one of the venerable
brethren who is in favour of our appointing the Bhikkhu N. N. to receive
the robes (presented), be silent, and any one who is not in favour of
it, speak. The Bhikkhu N. N. has been appointed by the Sa*m*gha to
receive the robes (presented). The Sa*m*gha is in favour of it,
therefore are you silent; thus I understand."'

to remind the reader that here and in the following chapters *k*îvara
can mean both 'a robe' and 'cloth for making robes.'
