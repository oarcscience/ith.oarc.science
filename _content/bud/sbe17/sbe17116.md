### 5 <span id="fr_604"></span>[1](#fn_593).

1\. 'A Bhikkhu against whom the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma has been carried out
ought to conduct himself aright. And herein this is the right
conduct <span id="fr_605"></span>[2](#fn_594): he ought not to confer
the upasampadâ--he ought not to give a nissaya <span
id="fr_606"></span>[3](#fn_595)--he ought not to provide

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

himself with a sâma*n*era <span id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_596)--he
ought not to accept the office of giving exhortation to the nuns <span
id="fr_608"></span>[2](#fn_597)--and if he has accepted the office, he
ought not to exhort the nuns <span id="fr_609"></span>[2](#fn_597)--he
ought not to commit the offence for which the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma has been
carried out by the Sa*m*gha against him--nor any offence of a similar
kind--nor any worse offence--he ought not to find fault with the
proceeding (that has been carried out against him)--nor with (the
Bhikkhus) who have carried it out--he ought not to raise objection
against a regular <span id="fr_610"></span>[3](#fn_598) Bhikkhu's taking
part in the Uposatha ceremony <span id="fr_611"></span>[4](#fn_599)--or
in the Pavâra*n*â ceremony <span id="fr_612"></span>[5](#fn_600)--he
ought not to issue commands (to a junior inhibiting him from going
beyond the bounds <span id="fr_613"></span>[6](#fn_601), or summoning
him to come before the elders)--he ought not to set on foot a censure
against any other Bhikkhu <span id="fr_614"></span>[7](#fn_602)--he
ought not to ask another Bhikkhu to give him leave (to rebuke that
Bhikkhu <span id="fr_615"></span>[8](#fn_603))--he ought not to warn
(another Bhikkhu <span id="fr_616"></span>[9](#fn_604) whom he supposes
to be offending)--he ought

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

not to call upon another Bhikkhu to remember (whether he has or has not
committed an offence)--and he ought not to associate with the Bhikkhus.'

Here end the eighteen duties which follow on a Ta*gg*aniya-kamma.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_593"></span>[337:1](sbe17116.htm#fr_604) This chapter is
repeated below for the Nissaya-, Pabbâ*g*aniya-, and
Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-kammas (chapters 10, 15, and 21). The corresponding
rule for the first two Ukkhepaniya-kammas is different, and much more
stringent (chapter 27, repeated in chapter 31); but that for the third
(chapter 33) is again the same as the rule laid down in this chapter. In
the second Khandhaka(s, 2) the list of restrictions is again longer.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[337:2](sbe17116.htm#fr_605) Sammâvattanâ. See
Mahâvagga I, 26, 1; 27,1; 33, 1; 34, 1.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[337:3](sbe17116.htm#fr_606) Buddhaghosa says,
âgantukâna*m* nissayo na dâtabbo. The relation of a junior Bhikkhu
either to his upa*ggh*âya or to his â*k*ariya is alike called nissaya
(Mahâvagga I, 36, 1); but the term is more especially applied to the
latter (Mahâvagga I, 32, 2, whereas in the corresponding formula for the
upa*ggh*âya, Mahâvagga <span id="page_338">p. 338</span> I, 25, 7,-- the
word nissaya does not occur). In other words, nissaya means all that is
included in the phrase 'nissâya te vatthabba*m*' (*K*ullavagga I, 9, 2).

<span id="fn_596"></span>[338:1](sbe17116.htm#fr_607) Compare Mahâvagga
I, 36, 37.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[338:2](sbe17116.htm#fr_609) See below,
*K*ullavagga X, 9, 4, and also the 21st Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[338:3](sbe17116.htm#fr_610) Compare Minayeff,
Pâtimokkha, p. 63.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[338:4](sbe17116.htm#fr_611) Compare
Pâtimokkha*m* *th*apetu*m* at *K*ullavagga IX, 2.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[338:5](sbe17116.htm#fr_612) Compare Mahâvagga
IV, 16, 2.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[338:6](sbe17116.htm#fr_613) As, for example,
under the rule at Mahâvagga I, 27, 2. Buddhaghosa says, Na
sava*k*aniya*m* kâtabban ti aham âyasmanta*m* asmi*m* vatthusmi*m*
va*k*aniya*m* karomi imamhâ âvâsâ param pi mâ pakkâmi yâva na ta*m*
adhikara*n*a*m* vûpasanta*m* hotîti. He also gives a longer note, partly
to the same effect, on the corresponding passage in II, 1, 2, which will
be found in our note there, and from which we have taken the second
clause in the parentheses.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[338:7](sbe17116.htm#fr_614) See the note on
this word in the next chapter.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[338:8](sbe17116.htm#fr_615) Compare Mahâvagga
II, 16, 1.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[338:9](sbe17116.htm#fr_616) Compare
*K*ullavagga IX, 5
