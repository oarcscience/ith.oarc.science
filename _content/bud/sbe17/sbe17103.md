1\. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, there be no offence which a Bhikkhu should see
(or, acknowledge as committed by himself), and if the Sa*m*gha, or a
number of Bhikkhus, or a single person reprove him (and say): "You have
committed an offence, friend; do you see that offence?"--and he replies:
"There is no offence, friends, which I should see," and the Sa*m*gha
pronounces expulsion against him for his refusal to see that
offence,--this is an unlawful act.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_515"></span>[274:1](sbe17103.htm#fr_524) The
ukkhepaniyakamma âpattiyâ appa*t*inissagge (expulsion for a Bhikkhu's
refusal to atone for an offence) is spoken of here exactly in the same
terms as those in which the ukkhepaniyakamma âpattiyâ adassane
(expulsion for a Bhikkhu's refusal to see an offence) is spoken of in
the preceding clause. The brethren say to the pretended offender, 'You
have committed an offence, friend; atone for that offence'--which he
refuses to do.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[274:2](sbe17103.htm#fr_525) As above; the
Bhikkhus institute the ukkhepaniyakamma pâpikâya di*tth*iyâ
appa*t*inissagge (expulsion for a Bhikkhu's refusal to renounce a false
doctrine).

<span id="fn_517"></span>[275:1](sbe17103.htm#fr_526) As in § 2, the
first and second of the three cases given in § 1 are combined, so follow
now combinations of the first and third, the second and third, and of
the first, second, and third cases respectively.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[275:2](sbe17103.htm#fr_527) Here follow again
the cases of the ukkhepaniyakamma âpattiyâ appa*t*inissagge and pâpikâya
di*tth*iyâ appa*t*inissagge, and the combinations of the three cases as
above.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[275:3](sbe17103.htm#fr_528) Here follow the
two other cases, together with the combinations of the three, exactly as
above.
