<p>1. Now at that time the venerable Upananda of the Sakya race, having spent the rainy season at S&acirc;vatthi, went to take up his abode in a certain village. The Bhikkhus in that place assembled together with the object of dividing the robes. They said to him</p>  
<p>'These robes, friend, which are the property of the Sa<I>m</I>gha, are about to be divided. Will you accept a share of them?'</p>  
<p>'Yes, friends, I will,' said he; and taking his share, departed thence and took up his abode elsewhere.</p>  
<p>[The same thing happened there, and] he departed thence and took up his abode elsewhere.</p>  
<p>[The same thing happened there, and so] he returned to S&acirc;vatthi with a great bundle of robes.</p>

In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu spend the rainy season alone in two residences, thinking thus to obtain many robes, then, if he have spent exactly half the season in one place and half in another, a half portion of the robes due to him shall be given to him in one place, and a half in the other; but in whichever place of the two he have spent a greater part of the rainy season, thence shall the portions of robes due to him be given.'</p>

<p>'Yes, friends, that is so.'</p>  
<p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were indignant, murmured, and became annoyed, saying, 'How can the venerable Upananda spend the rainy season in one place, and accept a share of robes in another place?'</p>  
<p>They told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>
