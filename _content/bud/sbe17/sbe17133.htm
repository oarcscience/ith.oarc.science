<p>1. So the Sa<I>m</I>gha carried out the Pa<I>t</I>is&acirc;ra<I>n</I>iyakamma against Sudhamma the Bhikkhu, saying, 'You are to ask and obtain pardon of <I>K</I>itta the householder. And after he had been subjected by the Sa<I>m</I>gha to the Pa<I>t</I>is&acirc;ra<I>n</I>iya-kamma, though he went to Ma<I>k</I><I>k</I>kik&acirc;sa<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, he was unable, being greatly troubled in his mind, to ask and obtain pardon of <I>K</I>itta the householder, but returned again even to S&acirc;vatthi.</p>  
<p>Then the Bhikkhus asked him, 'Has <I>K</I>itta the householder been induced by you to give you his pardon?'</p>  
<p>'Indeed, though I went to Ma<I>k</I><I>k</I>kik&acirc;sa<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, I was unable, being greatly troubled in my mind, to ask and obtain pardon of <I>K</I>itta the householder.'</p>  
<p>'They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>2. 'Let, then, the Sa<I>m</I>gha, O Bhikkhus, appoint a companion messenger to Sudhamma the Bhikkhu, to ask and obtain pardon of <I>K</I>itta the householder.</p>  
<p>'Now thus, O Bhikkhu, should the companion messenger be appointed. In the first place the Bhikkhu (who is to be sent) is to be asked (whether he is willing to go). After he has been asked, let some discreet and able Bhikkhu lay the matter before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, as follows:</p>  
<p>'"Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. If the time seems meet to the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha appoint such and such a Bhikkhu as a companion messenger to Sudhamma the Bhikkhu, to ask and obtain pardon of <I>K</I>itta the householder.</p>  
<p>'"This is the motion (<I>&ntilde;</I>atti).</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_368"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 368</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'"Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. The Sa<I>m</I>gha hereby appoints such and such a Bhikkhu as a companion messenger to Sudhamma the Bhikkhu, to ask and obtain pardon of <I>K</I>itta the householder. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves of such and such a Bhikkhu being appointed as a companion messenger to Sudhamma the Bhikkhu, let him remain silent. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak.</p>  
<p>'"Such and such a Bhikkhu has been appointed by the Sa<I>m</I>gha. (&amp;c., as before). The Sa<I>m</I>gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."</p>  
<p>3. 'Then, O Bhikkhus, let Sudhamma the Bhikkhu go, together with the Bhikkhu who is the companion messenger, to Ma<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ik&acirc;sa<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, and ask pardon of <I>K</I>itta the householder, saying, Pardon me, O householder; I desire to gain once more thy good pleasure." If, when he thus speaks, he pardons him, it is well. If he pardon him not, the Bhikkhu who is the companion messenger should say, "Pardon him, O householder; he desires to gain once more thy good pleasure." If, when he thus speaks, he pardon him, it is well. If he pardon him not, the Bhikkhu who is the companion messenger should say, "Pardon him, O householder; I desire to gain thy good pleasure." If, when he thus speaks, he pardon him, it is well. If he pardon him not, the Bhikkhu who is the companion messenger should say, "Grant pardon, O householder, to this Bhikkhu, in the name of the Sa<I>m</I>gha (I ask it)." If (&amp;c., as before, down to). If he pardon him not, 'the Bhikkhu who is the companion messenger--without going out of sight, and without going out of hearing,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_360"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 360</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of <I>K</I>itta the householder--should make Sudhamma the Bhikkhu arrange his robe on one shoulder, and squat down on his heels, and stretch forth his two hands with the palms together, and so confess his fault.'</p>
