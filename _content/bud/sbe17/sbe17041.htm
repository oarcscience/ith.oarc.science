<p>And the Blessed One, wandering from place to place, came to R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha. There the Blessed One dwelt near R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha, in the Ve<I>l</I>uvana, at Kalandakaniv&acirc;pa. At that time the Bhikkhus at R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha had plenty of sugar. The Bhikkhus feared to offend (and thought): 'The Blessed One has allowed the eating of sugar only to the sick and not to the healthy,' and therefore they did not eat sugar.</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, to the sick the eating of sugar, and to the healthy the drinking of sugar-water.'</p>
