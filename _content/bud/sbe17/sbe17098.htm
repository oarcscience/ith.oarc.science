<p>1. Now at that time the venerable Revata sent a robe to the venerable S&acirc;riputta in charge of a certain Bhikkhu, saying, 'Give this robe to the' Thera.'

<p>Now the venerable Revata, on meeting with the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A></p>  
<p>venerable S&acirc;riputta, asked him, saying, 'I sent to the venerable Thera a robe. Did that robe come into his hands?'</p>  
<p>'I know nothing, friend, about that robe.'</p>  
<p>Then the venerable Revata said to that Bhikkhu: 'I sent a robe, my friend, in your charge to the Thera. Where is that robe?'</p>  
<p>'I took the robe myself, Lord, in trust upon you.'</p>  
<p>They told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>2. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu send a robe in charge of a Bhikkhu, saying, "Give this robe to such and such a Bhikkhu;" and he, whilst on the way, takes it himself in trust on the one who sends it--then it is rightly taken. But if he takes it himself in trust on the one to whom it was sent, it is wrongly taken.</p>  
<p>'[The same repeated, the latter case being put first, and the former case last.]</p>  
<p>'Moreover in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu send a robe in charge of a Bhikkhu, saying, "Give this robe to such and such a Bhikkhu;" and he, whilst on the way, hears that that Bhikkhu who sent it is dead;--then if he keeps the robe himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as the robe of a deceased Bhikkhu, it is rightly kept; if he takes it himself in trust on the one to whom it was sent, it is wrongly taken.</p>  
<p>'[In the same case], if he, whilst on the way, hears that that Bhikkhu to whom it was sent is dead--then if he keeps the robe himself as the robe of a deceased Bhikkhu, it is wrongly kept; if he takes</p>

<p>it himself in trust on the one who sent it, it is rightly taken.</p>  
<p>[In the same case, if he hears, whilst on the way, that both are dead--then if he keeps it himself as the robe of a deceased Bhikkhu, to wit, the one who sent it, it is rightly kept; if he keeps it himself as the property of a deceased Bhikkhu, to wit, the one to whom it was sent, it is wrongly kept.]</p>  
<p>3. 'Moreover in case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu send a robe in charge of a Bhikkhu, saying, "I give the robe to such and such a Bhikkhu"--then [in all the cases given in &sect; 2 the decision is reversed]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>
