### 12.

'A Bhikkhu intent on finding a comfortable place (to live in), after the
Ka*th*ina ceremony has been held, takes a robe, and goes away, thinking,
"I will go to such and such a residence; if it is comfortable there, I
will remain there if it is not, I will go to such and such a residence;
if it is comfortable there, I will remain there; if it is not, I will go
to such and such a residence; if it is comfortable there, I will remain
there; if it is not, I will go back."

'When he has got beyond the boundary, he thinks, "I will have the robe
made up here, and will never go back," &c. <span

cases as before, and then the two cases of the sîmâtikkantika

be seen from chap. 2. 2 (the two last cases there) or from chap. 9. 3.
