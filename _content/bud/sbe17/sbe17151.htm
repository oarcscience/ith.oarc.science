<p>[In this chapter the same rules for the M&acirc;natta, or Penance, are laid down word for word as those in chapter 1, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 3, and 4, for the probation, reading throughout 'Bhikkhus who are going through the M&acirc;natta discipline' for 'Bhikkhus who have been placed under probation.' There are, however, one or two minor points of difference, which are as follows:</p>  
<p>1. At the end of the announcements (chapter 1,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_395"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 395</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> &sect; 2) there is inserted the injunction, 'He ought to announce the fact every day.'</p>  
<p>2. In the passages about going from one residence to another (chapter 1, &sect; 3) read 'unless with the Sa<I>m</I>gha' instead of 'unless with a regular Bhikkhu.']&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_726"></A><A HREF="#fn_708"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_708"></A><A HREF="sbe17151.htm#fr_726">395:1</A> It will be seen, therefore, that there is very little, one might almost say no practical, difference between the Pariv&acirc;sa, which we have rendered 'probation,' and the M&acirc;natta, which we have usually left untranslated, and sometimes rendered 'penance.' Neither the one nor the other are at present enforced anywhere among the Buddhists.</P>
