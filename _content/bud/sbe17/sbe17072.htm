<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you appoint a Bhikkhu possessed of the following five qualities, to receive the robes (presented to the Bhikkhus): (a person) who does not go in the evil course of lust, in the evil course of hatred, in the evil course of delusion, in the evil course of fear, and who knows what has been received and what has not.</p>

When he has been asked, let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following <I>&ntilde;</I>atti before the Sa<I>m</I>gha: "Let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, reverend Sirs, hear me. If the Sa<I>m</I>gha is ready, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha appoint the Bhikkhu N. N: to receive the robes (presented to the Bhikkhus). This is the <I>&ntilde;</I>atti.

N. has been appointed by the Sa<I>m</I>gha to receive the robes (presented). The Sa<I>m</I>gha is in favour of it, therefore are you silent; thus I understand."'</p>
