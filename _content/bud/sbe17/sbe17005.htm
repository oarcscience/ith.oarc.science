<p>1. Now at that time the Blessed One walked up and down in the open air&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> unshod. Noticing that, 'The Master walks unshod,' the Elders (the Thera Bhikkhus) also went unshod when they were walking up and down&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. But though the Master and the Thera Bhikkhus went unshod, the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus walked up and down with coverings on their feet.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The temperate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'How can these <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus walk shod, when the Master and the Thera Bhikkhus walk unshod?'</p>  
<p>2. Then those Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Is it true, what they say, O Bhikkhus, that the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus walk shod, though the Master and the Elders walk unshod?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
<p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying,</p>  
<p>'How, O Bhikkhus, can these foolish persons walk shod, though (&amp;c., as in &sect;&sect; 1, 2). For even the lay-men, O Bhikkhus, who are clad in white, for the sake of some handicraft that may procure them a living, will be respectful, affectionate, hospitable to their teachers. [3.] Do you, therefore, O Bhikkhus, so let (your light) shine forth, that you having left the world (to enter into) so well taught a doctrine and discipline may be respectful, affectionate, hospitable to your teachers (&acirc;<I>k</I>ariyas), or those who rank as teachers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and to your superiors (upa<I>g</I><I>gh</I>&acirc;yas), or those who rank as superiors&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. This will not conduce, O Bhikkhus, to the conversion of the unconverted, and to the augmentation of the number of the converted:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>but it will result, O Bhikkhus, in the unconverted being repulsed (from the faith), and in many of the converted becoming estranged.' Having thus rebuked them, and having delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>  
<p>None of you, O Bhikkhus, is to walk shod, when your teachers or those who rank as teachers, or your superiors, or those who rank as superiors, are walking unshod. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a offence.</p>  
<p>'And no one of you, O Bhikkhus, is to wear shoes in the open &Acirc;r&acirc;ma. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a offence.'</p>
