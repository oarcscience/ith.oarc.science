<p>'And which is a person, O Bhikkhus, against whom, if expulsion had not been pronounced before, and the Sa<I>m</I>gha pronounces expulsion against him, expulsion has been pronounced unduly? In case, O Bhikkhus, there be a pure, guiltless Bhikkhu,--if the Sa<I>m</I>gha pronounces expulsion against him, expulsion has been pronounced unduly.

If restoration, O Bhikkhus, had not been granted before to a person, and the Sa<I>m</I>gha grants restoration to him, there are some to whom such restoration will have been granted duly, and others to whom it will have been unduly granted.</p>  
<p>'And which is a person, O Bhikkhus, to whom, &amp;c., restoration has been granted unduly? A eunuch, O Bhikkhus, to whom restoration had not been granted before, and whom the Sa<I>m</I>gha restores, has been restored unduly.
