<p>1. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had committed numerous Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa offences; but he was not aware of the degree of the offences&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_744"></A><A HREF="#fn_723"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and was not aware of the duration of the times&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_745"></A><A HREF="#fn_723"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; or he did not recollect the degree of the offences, and did not recollect the duration of the times; or he was uncertain as to the degree of the offences, and was uncertain as to the duration of the times.</p>  
<p>He told the Bhikkhus, saying, 'I have committed, &amp;c. . . . but I am not aware, &amp;c. . . . I do not recollect, &amp;c. . . . I am uncertain, &amp;c. . . . What now shall I do?'</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>Then let the Sa<I>m</I>gha, O Bhikkhus, impose upon that Bhikkhu a probation of complete purification</p>

Now in what cases is the probation of complete purification to be imposed? When he is not aware of the degree of the offences, nor of the duration of the times; when he does not recollect the degree of the offences, nor the duration of the times; and when he is not certain as to the degree of the offences, nor as to the duration of the times--then is the probation of complete purification to be imposed.</p>  
<p>'When he is aware of the degree of the offences, but not of the duration of the times; when he does recollect the degree of the offences, but not the duration of the times; when he is certain as to the degree of the offences, but not as to the duration of the times--then is the probation of complete purification to be imposed.</p>

<p>1. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu, whilst he was under probation, threw off the robes. After-wards he came back again, and asked the Bhikkhus for upasampad&acirc;. They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu throws off the robes whilst he is under probation, there can follow no probation to him, O Bhikkhus, so long as he is out of the Order. If he afterwards receive the upasampad&acirc;, the original probation (previously imposed upon him, still remains obligatory) upon him. A probation once imposed, is imposed for good; a probation once undergone, is undergone for good; if any (portion of the time) remain over, the probation must be again undergone (from the beginning).</p>  
<p>'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu, whilst he is undergoing probation, becomes a S&acirc;ma<I>n</I>era. There can happen no probation to him, O Bhikkhus, so long as he is a S&acirc;ma<I>n</I>era. If he afterwards receives the upasampad&acirc; (&amp;c., as in the last paragraph, down to the end).</p>  
<p>'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu, whilst he is undergoing probation, goes out of his mind . . . . be-comes weak in his mind . . . . diseased in his sensations . . . . is suspended for not acknowledging an</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_420"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 420</FONT></A></p>  
<p>offence . . . . for not atoning for an offence . . . . for not recanting a sinful doctrine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_749"></A><A HREF="#fn_727"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--there can happen no probation to him, O Bhikkhus, so long as he is out of his mind . . . . weak in his mind . . . . suspended, &amp;c. If he afterwards becomes not out of his mind . . . . becomes not weak in his mind . . . . is restored from the suspension, the original probation is still obligatory upon him. A probation once imposed (&amp;c., as in the first paragraph, down to the end).</p>  
<p>2. 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu, whilst he is liable to be thrown back to the commencement of his probation, throws off the robes (&amp;c., as in all the paragraphs of section 1, reading "liable to be thrown back," for "undergoing probation").'</p>  
<p>3. [The same for a Bhikkhu who throws off the robes, or becomes any of the seven things specified, whilst he is liable to be subjected to the M&acirc;natta discipline;</p>
