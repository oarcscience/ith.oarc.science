<p>1. Now at that time the venerable Pilindava<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a had head-ache&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a little oil on the head.'</p>  
<p>(The disease) became no better&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the practice of taking up (medicine) through the nose&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.'</p>

<p>The nose ran.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a nose-spoon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus had various kinds of nose-spoons--made of gold, and of silver. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'Like those who still live in the world.'</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Various kinds of nose-spoons, O Bhikkhus, are not to be used. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a offence. I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of such nose-spoons made of bone (&amp;c., as in chap. 12. 1, down to:) or of the chank-shell.'</p>  
<p>2. The nose took up the medicament in unequal proportions.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a double nose-spoon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>(The disease) became no better.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to sniff up the aroma.'</p>  
<p>They used to spread the drugs on a wick before they sniffed up the aroma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: and their throats got burnt.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a pipe to conduct the aroma.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus had various kinds of pipes (&amp;c., as in the last clauses of &sect; 1, down to the end).</p>

<p>Now at that time the aroma-pipes came open: and worms got in.</p>  
<p>I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a lid to the pipes.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus carried the pipes about in their hands.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a bag to carry the aroma-pipes in.'</p>  
<p>The aroma-pipes rubbed against one another.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a double bag.'</p>  
<p>They had no shoulder strap.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a shoulder strap (by which to carry the double bag), or of a thread (by which to sew it on).'</p>
