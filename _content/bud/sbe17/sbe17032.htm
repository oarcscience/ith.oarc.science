<p>1. Now at that time a certain Br&acirc;hman had received some fresh tila seeds, and some fresh honey. Now it occurred to that Br&acirc;hman: 'What if I were to give these fresh tila seeds, and this</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>fresh honey to the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha with the Buddha at their head.' And that Br&acirc;hman went to the place where the Blessed One was, and when he had come there, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One. And after he had exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and compliments of friendship and civility, he stood on one side. And, so standing, that Br&acirc;hman said to the Blessed One:</p>  
<p>'May the venerable Gotama grant me that the venerable Gotama shall take his morrow's meal at my home to-morrow with the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha.'</p>  
<p>The Blessed One consented by remaining silent. And when that Br&acirc;hman perceived that the Blessed One had consented he. went away.</p>  
<p>2. And that Br&acirc;hman, at the end of that night, when he had made ready sweet food, both hard and soft, had the time announced to the Blessed One (in the words), 'It is time, O Gotama, and the meal is prepared.'</p>  
<p>And the Blessed One, early in the morning, having put on his under robe, went duly bowled and robed to that Br&acirc;hman's residence. And when he had come there, he sat down on a seat prepared for him, and with him the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha.</p>  
<p>And that Br&acirc;hman satisfied with the sweet food, hard and soft, the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha with the Buddha at their head, and waited on them with his own hand. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and had washed his hands and his howl, the Br&acirc;hman took his seat on one side. And as he so sat the Blessed One instructed, and roused, and incited, and gladdened that Br&acirc;hman with religious discourse, and rose from his seat, and went away.</p>  
<p>3. Now not long after the Blessed One had gone</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></p>  
<p>it occurred to that Br&acirc;hman: 'The things for the sake of which I invited the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha with the Buddha at their head, thinking, "I will give them the fresh tila seeds and the fresh honey,"--those I have neglected to give. What if I were now to have the fresh tila seeds and the fresh honey taken, in pots and vessels, to the &Acirc;r&acirc;ma!'</p>  
<p>And that Br&acirc;hman had the fresh tila seeds and the fresh honey taken in pots and vessels, and went to the place where the Blessed One was. 'And when he had come there, he stood on one side; and so standing that Br&acirc;hman said to the Blessed One:</p>  
<p>4. 'The things for the sake of which I invited the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha with the Buddha at their head, thinking, "I will give them the fresh tila seeds and the fresh honey,"--those I have neglected to give. May the venerable Gotama receive of me the fresh tila seeds and the fresh honey.'</p>  
<p>'Very well then, Br&acirc;hman; give them to the Bhikkhus.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time, during the scarcity, people invited Bhikkhus to a slender meal, and they, counting the number (of those invited), refused (the invitation). And the whole Sa<I>m</I>gha was (once) invited; but the Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, did not accept the invitation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'Accept it, O Bhikkhus, and eat. I allow, O Bhikkhus, that a Bhikkhu who has eaten and who has refused food still offered may nevertheless eat food, if it be brought from within, even if it has not been left over&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_173"></A><A HREF="sbe17032.htm#fr_175">74:2</A> This is an exception to P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya 35. A Bhikkhu who has <A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A> finished, and has declared himself to have done so by declining further food, can still take 'leavings' without offending. By this rule he is also allowed to take food tato n&icirc;hata<I>m</I>, literally, 'brought out thence,' which seems to mean 'out of the store of the giver.' The expression recurs in VI, 32, I, and again in VI, 32, 2 (at the end), where the exceptions to P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya 35 laid down in this and the following rules are again, the scarcity having passed away, put aside by 'the Blessed One.'</P>
