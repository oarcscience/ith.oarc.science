### 21.

1\. Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'What is the limit for the size of a robe
up to which it ought to be handed over to another Bhikkhu <span
id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_420)?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, to hand over any robe which is in length eight
inches according to the accepted inch <span
id="fr_429"></span>[2](#fn_421).'

Now at that time a robe belonging to the venerable Mahâ Kassapa, which
had been made of cast-off pieces of cloth became heavy (by reason of the
weight of the new pieces tacked on to it <span
id="fr_430"></span>[3](#fn_422)).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to darn it roughly together with thread <span
id="fr_431"></span>[4](#fn_423).'

It was uneven at the end <span id="fr_432"></span>[5](#fn_424).

They told this thing to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to remove the unevenness <span
id="fr_433"></span>[6](#fn_425).'

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

The threads frayed out <span id="fr_434"></span>[1](#fn_426).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to put a braiding or a binding along or round
(the edge) <span id="fr_435"></span>[2](#fn_427):

Now at that time the ribbons <span id="fr_436"></span>[3](#fn_428) of
the under garment gave way <span id="fr_437"></span>[4](#fn_429).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make an eight-footed . . .  <span
id="fr_438"></span>[5](#fn_430).'

2\. Now at that time when a set of robes was being made for a certain
Bhikkhu it was impossible to make it entirely from torn pieces of
cloth <span id="fr_439"></span>[6](#fn_431).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to have two of the robes made of torn pieces
of cloth, and one of cloth not torn.'

It was impossible to make two of the robes of torn pieces of cloth, and
one of cloth not torn.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make two robes

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (out of the set)
of untorn pieces, and one of torn pieces.'

Even this was impossible.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make (each robe out of the set) half (from
torn pieces) and half <span id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_432) (from untorn
pieces). But a set of robes made entirely from untorn pieces is not to
be worn. Whosoever shall wear (a set of robes so made) is guilty of a
dukka*t*a.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_420"></span>[230:1](sbe17088.htm#fr_428) See VIII, 13, 8,
and our note on the 59th Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[230:2](sbe17088.htm#fr_429) See our note on
this word in the 92nd Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[230:3](sbe17088.htm#fr_430) So explains the
commentary, *Kh*inna-*tth*âne aggalâropanena garuko hoti.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[230:4](sbe17088.htm#fr_431) Suttalûkha*m*
kâtun ti sutten’ eva aggala*m* kâtun ti attho (B.). Compare above,
chapter 12. 2.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[230:5](sbe17088.htm#fr_432) Vika*nn*o ti
suttam a*ñk*itvâ sibbantâna*m* eko sa*m*ghâ*t*i-ko*n*o digho hoti, says
Buddhaghosa. Vika*nn*aka in the 233rd *G*âtaka seems to mean 'harpoon.'

<span id="fn_425"></span>[230:6](sbe17088.htm#fr_433) Vika*nn*am
uddharitun ti dîgha-ko*n*a*m* *kh*inditu*m* (B.).

<span id="fn_426"></span>[231:1](sbe17088.htm#fr_434) Okiratî (sic) ti
*kh*inna-ko*n*ato ga*l*ati (B.). Ga*l*ati at VI, r3, 1, is 'ran over,'
whereas okiriyanti at the corresponding passages VI, 12, 1, 2, is 'were
spilt.' Probably the above rendering is the real meaning here, as the
threads could not be literally spilt or sprinkled.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[231:2](sbe17088.htm#fr_435) On these difficult
technical terms Buddhaghosa provokingly says, anuvâta*m* paribha*nd*am
anuvâta*ñ* *k*’ eva paribha*nd*a*m*. Childers, under the first, has
merely 'with the wind,' and under the second, 'girdle.' The same
expressions occur also above, at VII, 1, 5, where Buddhaghosa, again
only explains the words by the words themselves.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[231:3](sbe17088.htm#fr_436) We probably ought
to read pa*tt*â, not pattâ; but what is meant by the ribbons of the
sa*m*ghâ*t*i is very doubtful. Buddhaghosa says nothing.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[231:4](sbe17088.htm#fr_437) For lu*gg*ati
compare palu*gg*ati.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[231:5](sbe17088.htm#fr_438) What this is is
again uncertain, and Buddhaghosa gives no help.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[231:6](sbe17088.htm#fr_439) See above, chapter
11, at the end.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[232:1](sbe17088.htm#fr_440) Anvâdhika*m*, on
which Buddhaghosa says nothing.
