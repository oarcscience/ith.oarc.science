<p>1. So the Sa<I>m</I>gha carried out the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma against the Bhikkhus who were followers of Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>uka and Lohitaka. And when they had been subjected by the Sa<I>m</I>gha to the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma and were conducting themselves aright in accordance thereto, they became subdued&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_618"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and they sought for release&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_619"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; and going up to the Bhikkhus they spake as follows: 'We, Sirs, have been subjected by the Sa<I>m</I>gha to the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma (&amp;c., down to) release. What now should. we do?'</p>  
<p>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha revoke the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma carried out against the followers of Pa<I>n</I><I>d</I>uka and Lohitaka.</p>

<p>when a Bhikkhu is characterised, a Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma ought not to be revoked for him; (that is to say), when he confers the upasampad&acirc;--when he gives a nissaya--when he provides himself with a s&acirc;ma<I>n</I>era--when he accepts the office of giving exhortation to the nuns--and when, having accepted that office, he exhorts the nuns. These are the five things, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) revoked for him.</p>  
<p>'There are other five things, O Bhikkhus, by which, when a Bhikkhu is characterised, a Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma ought not to be revoked for him; (that is to say), when he commits the offence for which the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma has been carried out by the Sa<I>m</I>gha against him--or any other offence of a similar kind--or any worse offence--when he finds fault with the proceeding that has been carried out against him--or with the Bhikkhus who have carried it out. These are five things, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) revoked for him.</p>  
<p>There are eight things, O Bhikkhus, by which, when a Bhikkhu is characterised, a Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma ought not to be revoked for him; (that is to say), when he raises objections against a regular&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_620"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Bhikkhu's taking part in the Uposatha ceremony--or in the Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; ceremony--when he inhibits a junior from going beyond the bounds--when he sets on foot a censure against any other Bhikkhu--when he asks another Bhikkhu to give</p>

<p>him leave to rebuke that Bhikkhu--when he warns another Bhikkhu whom he supposes to be offending--when he reminds another Bhikkhu of a rule against which he supposes that Bhikkhu to be offending--when he associates with the Bhikkhus. These are the eight things, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) revoked for him.'</p>

That our translation is correct is evident from the use of panna-lomo (at <I>K</I>ullavagga VII, 1, 6), that being simply the opposite of ha<I>t</I><I>th</I>a-lomo, which signifies 'having the hair of the body erect in consequence of the excitement produced by fear, joy, or amazement;' and hence simply 'troubled, excited.' The opposite of this is 'pacified, subdued.'</P>
