1\. Now at that time the venerable Bela*tth*asîsa, the superior of the
venerable Ânanda, had a disease of thick scabs; and by reason of the
discharge thereof his robes stuck to his body. The Bhikkhus moistened
those robes with water, and loosened them (from his body).

The Blessed One as he was wandering in search of a lodging-place for the
night saw them \[doing so\], and going up to the place where they were,
he asked them:

'What is the matter, O Bhikkhus, with this Bhikkhu?'

'The venerable one has the disease of thick scabs; and by reason of the
discharge thereof his robes stick to his body. So we moisten those robes
with water, and loosen them (from his body).'

2\. Then the Blessed One on that occasion, having delivered a religious
discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of chunam as a medicine by whomsoever has
the itch, or boils, or a discharge, or scabs, or whose body is
ill-smelling, and to those in health the use of dry dung <span
id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_113), and of clay, and of colouring
matter <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_114). I allow the use, O
Bhikkhus, of a pestle and mortar <span id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_115).'
