### 14.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Vesâlî as long as he
thought fit, he went onwards on his journey towards Benares. And in due
course he arrived at Benares, and there, at Benares, he stayed in the
hermitage in the Migadâya.

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu's under robe was torn. And that
Bhikkhu thought: 'The Blessed

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> One has ordained
the use of three robes, a double waist cloth, and a single upper robe,
and a single under-garment <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_390), and
this under-garment of mine is torn. What if I were to insert a slip of
cloth <span id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_391) so that the robe shall be
double all round and single in the middle.'

2\. So that Bhikkhu inserted a slip of cloth. And the Blessed One on his
way round the sleeping apartments saw him doing so, went up to the place
where he was, and said to him:

'What are you doing, O Bhikkhu?'

'I am inserting a slip of cloth, Lord.'

'That is very good, O Bhikkhu. It is quite right of you, O Bhikkhu, to
insert a slip of cloth.'

And the Blessed One on that occasion, when he had delivered a religious
*d*iscourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use a double waist cloth, and a single
upper robe, and a single under-garment, of cloths which are new, or as
good as new <span id="fr_397"></span>[3](#fn_392); and the use of a
fourfold waist cloth, and of a double upper robe, and of a double under
robe of cloth which has been worn for a long time. You are to make
endeavour to get sufficient material from rags taken from the
dust-heap <span id="fr_398"></span>[4](#fn_393), or from bits picked up
in the bazaar <span id="fr_399"></span>[4](#fn_393). I allow you, O
Bhikkhus, slips of cloth inserted bolt-like to hold a torn robe

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

together, patches <span id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_394), darns <span
id="fr_401"></span>[2](#fn_395), and small pieces of cloth sewn on by
way of marking <span id="fr_402"></span>[2](#fn_395), or of
strengthening <span id="fr_403"></span>[2](#fn_395) the robe.'
