### 3.

1\. 'There are three things, O Bhikkhus, by which, when a
Ta*gg*aniya-kamma is characterised, it is a proceeding in accordance
with the Dhamma, a proceeding in accordance with the Vinaya, and is easy
to be settled; (that is to say), when it has been carried out in a full
assembly of qualified persons, according to law, and in the presence of
the litigant parties--when it has been carried out after the accused
person has been heard--when it has been carried out after the accused
person has confessed himself guilty. A Ta*gg*aniya-kamma, O Bhikkhus,
characterised by these three things is in accordance with the Dhamma,
and in accordance with the Vinaya, and is easy to be settled.'

\[And in a similar way the opposite of each of the twelve propositions
in the last section is here laid down.\]

Here end the twelve cases of a proceeding (Kamma) which is according to
law.
