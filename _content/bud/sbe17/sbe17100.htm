<p>1. At that time the Bhikkhus of <I>K</I>amp&acirc; performed official acts in the following ways: they performed unlawful acts before an incomplete congregation; they performed unlawful acts before a complete congregation; they performed lawful acts before an incomplete congregation; they performed seemingly lawful acts before an incomplete congregation; they performed seemingly lawful acts before a complete congregation; a single Bhikkhu pronounced expulsion against a single one; a single Bhikkhu pronounced expulsion against two; a single Bhikkhu</p>

<p>2. Those Bhikkhus who were moderate, were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the Bhikkhus of <I>K</I>amp&acirc; perform official acts in the following ways: perform unlawful acts before an incomplete congregation (&amp;c., down to:) how can a Sa<I>m</I>gha pronounce expulsion against another Sa<I>m</I>gha?'</p>  
<p>These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Is it true, as they say, O Bhikkhus, that the Bhikkhus of <I>K</I>amp&acirc; perform official acts in the following ways, &amp;c.?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
<p>Then the blessed Buddha rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'It is improper, O Bhikkhus, what these foolish persons are doing; it is unbecoming, indecent, unworthy of Sama<I>n</I>as, unallowable, and to be avoided. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, perform official acts in the following ways, &amp;c. This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted.' Having thus rebuked them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>  
<p>3. 'If an official act, O Bhikkhus, is performed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_263"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 263</FONT></A></p>  
<p>unlawfully by an incomplete congregation, it is no real act&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and ought not to be performed. An official act performed unlawfully by a complete congregation is no real act and ought not to be performed (&amp;c., as in &sect; 1, down to:). A seemingly lawful act performed before a complete congregation is no real act and ought not to be performed. In case a single Bhikkhu pronounces expulsion against a single one,--this is no real act and ought not to be performed (&amp;c., down to:). In case a Sa<I>m</I>gha pronounces expulsion against another Sa<I>m</I>gha,--this is no real act and ought not to be performed.</p>  
<p>4. 'There are, O Bhikkhus, four kinds of official acts (which a Sa<I>m</I>gha can perform); an unlawful act performed by an incomplete congregation, an unlawful act performed by a complete congregation, a lawful act performed by an incomplete congregation, and a lawful act performed by a complete congregation.</p>  
<p>'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is unlawful and performed by an incomplete congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is objectionable and invalid on account of its unlawfulness and of the incompleteness (of the congregation). Such an act, O Bhikkhus, ought not to be performed, nor is such an act allowed by me.</p>  
<p>'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is unlawful and performed by a complete congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is objectionable and invalid on account of its unlawfulness. Such an act, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is lawful and performed by an incomplete congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is objectionable and invalid on account of</p>

<p><A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the incompleteness (of the congregation). Such an act, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>'If, O Bhikkhus, an act is lawful and performed by a complete congregation--such an act, O Bhikkhus, is unobjectionable and valid on account of its lawfulness and of the completeness (of the congregation). Such an act, O Bhikkhus, ought to be performed, and such an act is allowed by me.</p>  
<p>'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, you ought to train yourselves thus: "Lawful acts which are performed by complete congregations--such acts will we perform&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."'</p>
