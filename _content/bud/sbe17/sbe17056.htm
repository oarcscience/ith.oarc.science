<P><A NAME="fn_299"></A><A HREF="sbe17056.htm#fr_303">156:4</A> The new chapter should have begun here, and not with the next section as printed in the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_300"></A><A HREF="sbe17056.htm#fr_304">157:1</A> M&acirc;tik&acirc; &#8217;ti m&acirc;taro <I>g</I>anettiyo &#8217;ti attho(B.). So also in VIII, 14.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_301"></A><A HREF="sbe17056.htm#fr_305">157:2</A> The discussion of these eight grounds of the suspension of the five Ka<I>th</I>ina privileges is closely connected with the description in the 13th chapter of the two so-called Palibodhas. Palibodha seems to mean the continued existence of a claim on the Bhikkhu's side to a share in the distribution of the Ka<I>th</I>ina. Two conditions are necessary to the validity of this claim; the first touching the Bhikkhu's domicile (&acirc;v&acirc;sa), the second the state of his wardrobe (<I>k</I>&icirc;vara). He must remain within the boundary (s&icirc;m&acirc;) of the Sa<I>m</I>gha to whom the Ka<I>th</I>ina has been given; or if he has left it, then he must have the intention of returning, the animus revertendi. And secondly, he must be in actual want of robes. If either of these conditions fail, then the Bhikkhu is apalibodha in respect of the &acirc;v&acirc;sa or the <I>k</I>&icirc;vara respectively. If he is apalibodha in both respects, then there follows the suspension of the Ka<I>th</I>ina privileges, the ka<I>th</I>in-uddh&acirc;ra, or ka<I>th</I>in-ubbh&acirc;ra, so far as he is concerned.</p>  
<p>So the eight grounds of the suspension of the privileges referred to in our present section (chap. 1. 7) either refer to the Bhikkhu's domicile or to the state of his robes, or to ways in which his case falls within the general suspension of privileges of the whole Sa<I>m</I>gha, Each of the eight cases is explained in detail in the following sections, except the sixth ground, which is specially treated of afterwards in chapters 8 and 9. See the note on the title at the end of this chapter, and compare further our note on the first Nissaggiya P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya.</P>
