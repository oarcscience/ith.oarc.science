<P><A NAME="fn_474"></A><A HREF="sbe17096.htm#fr_482">248:3</A> Buddhaghosa says that the robes of the colours mentioned in this chapter may be worn if they have first been dyed, or may be used as coverlets, or may be cut up and used as parts of robes. So the robes with skirts to them may be worn if the forbidden skirts have first been torn or cut off.</P>
