<p>for not acknowledging, and for not atoning for, an offence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_670"></A><A HREF="#fn_656"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">25.</h3>  
<p>1. Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was dwelling at Kosamb&icirc;, in the Ghosita &Acirc;r&acirc;ma. And at that time the venerable <I>Kh</I>anna&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_671"></A><A HREF="#fn_657"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, when he had committed a fault, was not willing to acknowledge the fault. Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the venerable <I>Kh</I>anna act so?' And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, after he had convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha, asked the Bhikkhus:</p>  
<p>'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that <I>Kh</I>anna</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p><A NAME="page_371"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 371</FONT></A></p>  
<p>when he has committed a fault, is not willing to acknowledge the fault?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord!'</p>  
<p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'How, O Bhikkhus, can that foolish one act so? This will not conduce either to the conversion of the unconverted, or to the increase of the converted; but rather to those who have not been converted being not converted, and to the turning back of those who have been converted.'</p>  
<p>And when the Blessed One had so rebuked him, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus and said: 'Let therefore the Sa<I>m</I>gha, O Bhikkhus, carry out against <I>Kh</I>anna the Bhikkhu the &acirc;pattiy&acirc; adassane Ukkhepaniya-kamma (the Act of Suspension which follows on not acknowledging a fault) to the intent that he shall not eat or dwell together with the Sa<I>m</I>gha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_672"></A><A HREF="#fn_658"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'Now thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be carried out.' [Here follow the formal words of' the Kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc; as in chapter 1, 4, with the necessary alterations owing to the difference of the fault and of the K am ma following on it. And at the end of the Kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc; (after the words 'Thus I understand') the following sentence is added.]</p>  
<p>'And send a proclamation, O Bhikkhus, from residence to residence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_659"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; saying, "<I>Kh</I>anna the Bhikkhu has been subjected by the Sa<I>m</I>gha to the Ukkhepaniya-kamma for not acknowledging a fault."'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_656"></A><A HREF="sbe17136.htm#fr_670">370:1</A> There is no mention in the P&acirc;timokkha of any such proceeding. At the close of each of the four P&acirc;<I>t</I>idesaniya Rules there is a form of confession to be observed. It would seem from the following chapters, which are nowhere expressly confined to these four cases, that a similar confession was expected after the commission of an offence against any of the P&acirc;timokkha Rules. In the closing words of the Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa Rules, an older proceeding is mentioned, under which an offending Bhikkhu who has not confessed any breach of either of those thirteen Rules is to remain on probation for as many days he has allowed to go by without confessing,</P>
