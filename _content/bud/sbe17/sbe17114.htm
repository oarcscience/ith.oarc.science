'There are three things, O Bhikkhus, by which, when a Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma is characterised, it is a proceeding in accordance with the Dhamma, a proceeding in accordance with the Vinaya, and is easy to be settled; (that is to say), when it has been carried out in a full assembly of qualified persons, according to law, and in the presence of the litigant parties--when it has been carried out after the accused person has been heard--when it has been carried out after the accused person has confessed himself guilty. A Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma, O Bhikkhus, characterised by these three things is in accordance with the Dhamma, and in accordance with the Vinaya, and is easy to be settled.'</p>
