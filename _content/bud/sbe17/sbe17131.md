loss on the laity--when he goes about to do harm to the laity--when he
goes about to deprive the laity of their dwellings--when he reviles and
finds fault with the laity--when he brings about division between the
laity. These are the five things, O Bhikkhus, which (&c., as above, down
to) against him.

'There are other five things, O Bhikkhus, which when they characterise a
Bhikkhu, the Sa*m*gha, if it likes, should carry out the
Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-kamma against him; (that is to say), when he speaks to
the laity in dispraise of the Buddha--when he speaks to the laity in
dispraise of the Dhamma--when he speaks to the laity in dispraise of the
Sa*m*gha--when he puts laymen down, and lowers them by censure--when he
does not fulfil a promise made in accordance with the Rules to the
laity. These are the other five things, O Bhikkhus, which (&c., as
before, down to) against him.

'There are five kinds of Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, against whom the
Sa*m*gha, if it likes, should carry out the Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-kamma;
(that is to say), one who goes about to bring loss on the laity (&c., as
in the last paragraph, down to the end).'
