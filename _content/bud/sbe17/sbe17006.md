### 5.

1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had an eruption <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_40) on his feet. They used to carry that
Bhikkhu out when he wanted to ease himself. The Blessed One as he was
passing through the sleeping places (of the Bhikkhus) saw them (doing
so), and going up to them, he said:

2\. 'What is the disease, O Bhikkhus, from which this Bhikkhu suffers?'

This venerable brother has an eruption on his feet, Lord, and we are
carrying him out to ease himself.'

Then, on that occasion, the Blessed One, having delivered a religious
discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'I enjoin, O Bhikkhus, the use of foot coverings

by one whose feet hurt him, or are blistered, or who has an eruption on
his feet.'
