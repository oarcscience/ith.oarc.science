### 4.

1\. 'There are three things, O Bhikkhus, which, when they characterise a
Bhikkhu, the Sa*m*gha, if it likes, should carry out the
Ta*gg*aniya-kamma against him; (that is to say), when he is a maker of
strife, quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, and a
raiser of legal questions in the Sa*m*gha <span

faults, and devoid of merit--when he is living in lay society, in
unlawful

association with the world. There are three things, O Bhikkhus, which,
when the Sa*m*gha suspects (&c., as before, down to) against him.

There are other three things, O Bhikkhus, (&c., as before, down to)
against him; (that is to say), when he has failed in morality as regards
moral things--when he has failed in conduct as regards
transgression--when he has failed in opinion as regards the principal
matters of opinion <span id="fr_603"></span>[1](#fn_592). There are
three things, O Bhikkhus, (&c., as before, down to) against him.

There are other three things, O Bhikkhus, (&c., as before, down to)
against him; (that is to say), when he speaks in dispraise of the
Buddha--when he speaks in dispraise of the Dhamma--when he speaks in
dispraise of the Sa*m*gha. These are three things, O Bhikkhus, (&c., as
before, down to) against him.

2\. 'There are three kinds of Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, against whom, if the
Sa*m*gha likes, it should carry out the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma; (that is to
say), one who is a maker of strife (&c., as in § 1, down to) a raiser of
legal questions in the Sa*m*gha--one who is dull, stupid, full of
faults, and devoid of merit--and one who is living in lay society, in
unlawful association with the world. These are three kinds of Bhikkhus,
O Bhikkhus, (&c., as before, down to) the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma.

'There are other three kinds of Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, against whom, if
the Sa*m*gha likes, it should carry out the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma; (that is
to say), one who has failed in morality in regard to moral matters--one
who has failed in conduct

as regards transgression--one who has failed in opinion as regards the
principal matters of opinion. These are three kinds of Bhikkhus, O
Bhikkhus (&c., as before, down to) the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma.

'There are other three kinds of Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, against whom, if
the Sa*m*gha likes, it should carry out the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma; (that is
to say), one who speaks in dispraise of the Buddha--one who speaks in
dispraise of the Dhamma--one who speaks in dispraise of the Sa*m*gha.
These are three kinds of Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus (&c., as before, down to)
the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma.'
