<p>1. Nov the Blessed One having remained at R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha as long as he thought fit, proceeded on his way to S&acirc;vatthi. And wandering straight on from place to place he arrived at S&acirc;vatthi. And there, at S&acirc;vatthi, the Blessed One stayed at the <I>G</I>etavana, An&acirc;tha-pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ika's Grove.</p>  
<p>Now at that time the venerable S&acirc;riputta suffered from fever. And the venerable Mah&acirc; Moggall&acirc;na went to the place where the venerable S&acirc;riputta was; and when he had come there he said to the venerable S&acirc;riputta:</p>  
<p>You have lately had fever, friend S&acirc;riputta. By what means has it got well?'</p>  
<p>'By lotus stalks, my friend, of various kinds.'</p>  
<p>Then the venerable Mah&acirc; Moggall&acirc;na, as quickly as a strong man would stretch forth his arm, or draw it in again when it had been stretched forth, vanished from the <I>G</I>etavana and appeared on the bank of the Mand&acirc;kin&icirc; lake.</p>  
<p>2. And a certain N&acirc;ga saw the venerable Mah&acirc;</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Moggall&acirc;na coming from afar: and on seeing him he said to the venerable Mah&acirc; Moggall&acirc;na:</p>  
<p>'May my lord, the venerable Mah&acirc; Moggall&acirc;na, approach. Welcome to my lord, the venerable Mah&acirc; Moggall&acirc;na. What may my lord have need of? What shall I give to him?'</p>  
<p>'I want the edible stalks of the various lotuses.'</p>  
<p>Then that N&acirc;ga gave command to another N&acirc;ga, saying, 'Very well then, good friend, give the venerable one edible stalks of the lotuses.'</p>  
<p>And that N&acirc;ga plunged into the Mand&acirc;kin&icirc; lake, and plucked with his trunk edible stalks of the lotuses, and washed them thoroughly, and bound them in a bundle, and went to the place where the venerable Mah&acirc; Moggall&acirc;na was.</p>  
<p>3. Then the venerable Mah&acirc; Moggall&acirc;na as quickly (&amp;c., as in &sect; 1) vanished from the bank of the Mand&acirc;kin&icirc; lake, and appeared in <I>G</I>etavana. Then that N&acirc;ga also vanished from the bank of the Mand&acirc;kin&icirc; lake, and appeared in the <I>G</I>etavana. And when that N&acirc;ga had caused the venerable Mah&acirc; Moggall&acirc;na to receive those edible stalks of the lotuses he vanished from the <I>G</I>etavana, and appeared on the shore of the Mand&acirc;kin&icirc; lake.</p>  
<p>Then the venerable Mah&acirc; Moggall&acirc;na presented those edible stalks of the lotuses to the venerable S&acirc;riputta. And the fever abated on the venerable S&acirc;riputta when he had eaten the edible stalks of the lotuses. And many of them remained over.</p>  
<p>4. Now at that time, during the scarcity (&amp;c., as above, in chap. 18. 4, down to:) did not accept the invitation.</p>  
<p>'Accept it, O Bhikkhus, and eat. I allow a Bhikkhu who has eaten, and has refused food still</p>
