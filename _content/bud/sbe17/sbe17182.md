<span id="fn_732"></span>[422:2](sbe17182.htm#fr_754) The Samanta
Pâsâdikâ says, Pa*kkh*imasmi*m* âpattikkhandhe ti eko ’va so
âpattikkhandho, pa*t*i*kkh*âditattâ pana pa*kkh*imasmi*m* âpattikkhandhe

the last note.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[423:2](sbe17182.htm#fr_756) This section
should correspond to chap. 31, section 2, but as noted by H. O. in his
edition of the text, p. 312, there is very great confusion in the MSS.
We ought to have four cases of which the distinctions are as under.
Those offences

All these four cases are required to make up the one hundred <span
id="page_424">p. 424</span> cases mentioned in the title at the close of
chap. 30; but the first is altogether omitted in the text, and the
others are not properly discriminated. We have supplied the first in
brackets, and corrected the others accordingly.
