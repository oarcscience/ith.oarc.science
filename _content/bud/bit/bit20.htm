<P ALIGN="CENTER">Importance attributed to astrology.</P>
<P>THE Tibetans, like all primitive nations, attribute to the position of the sun in reference to the constellations, to the planets, to the direct active interference of gods and spirits, and such like, a very considerable influence upon the welfare of man in this and in future existences. To their priests, the Lamas, they ascribe the faculty of deciding what circumstances are to be considered as favourable, and what unfavourable, for counteracting the effect of influences prejudicial to man, and for obtaining the assistance of benevolent spirits. These ends they seek to</P>
<P>{p. 291}</P>
<P>attain by the performance of certain ceremonies and the presentation of various offerings; and nearly every individual case requires to be accompanied by a ceremony,[1] the efficacy of which does not, however, depend upon its being performed by any particular Lama, although the services of a Lama in great repute for sanctity are considered to increase the chances of the ceremony's producing the desired effect. But with respect to the science of "divination," having for object the determining of the character of a day, the residence for the time being of the gods, &amp;c., the Lamas are not held to be equally endowed, one as the other. Those who have made a particular study of astrology, are applied to in all important cases having reference to the public welfare, as well as on such occasions as the marriage or the death of men of rank and wealth; whilst for subjects of minor importance every Lama is considered well-informed enough to give the required decision. In every monastery there is at least one divining Lama, who is then styled "the astrologer;" and larger ones even have one of the famous Choichong astrologers.[2] These latter have a particular school in the monastery Garmakhy&aacute; at Lh&aacute;ssa, whilst the ordinary astrologers are instructed in the science by an elder priest; the principal part of their preparatory labours is the profound study of numerous mystical works.</P>
<P>The decisions of the astrologers are pretended to be</P>

<P>2. See p. 156.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 292}</P>
<P>the result of mathematical calculations, combined with due observation of the phenomena to be taken into consideration for the case in point. The corresponding phenomena and their value vary considerably; there are, however, certain rules respecting the different modalities, and the explanation of these rules forms the subject of numerous books on astrology. The deference paid to the Lamas in such things depends to a great extent upon the observance of secrecy with reference to the combinations employed and the ceremonies performed; these things are kept a perfect secret to Tibetans as well as to Europeans; and even Chibu Lama, who, in his intercourse with Europeans, had laid aside many a superstition, showed great reserve in communicating to my brother Hermann the clue to symbolical designs, or such like; although neither Chibu nor any other Lama ever showed any particular hesitation to sell such objects, when no detailed explanation was demanded. The St. Petersburg libraries, also, contain but few in which the rules for their interpretation are given. Even the different provinces have each its own peculiar principles of divination, and are but indifferently acquainted with the operations practised by, and the formularies in use among their neighbours. Many of the tables and symbolical diagrams described further on proved quite a novelty to the Lama Gombojew, when he was requested to transcribe for me into capital letters those sentences which in the original were written in the small characters.</P>
<P>To the difficulties of obtaining information was added that arising from the vagueness with which all natives</P>
<P>{p. 293}</P>
<P>speak when attempting any explanation, even of subjects far less mystical than astrology and divination. This may be offered as an excuse for the following details not being so complete and satisfactory as might be desired. And, besides, I could not well alter them much, as in their existing state they were best calculated to make us acquainted with the notions of the Tibetans concerning the natural phenomena and the functions of their gods.</P>
<P>Tables used for the following purposes shall be described:</P>
<P>1. Tables for indicating lucky and unlucky periods.</P>
<P>2. Tables of direction, to determine towards what part of the compass the face of a man is to be turned when praying, and what direction his feet must take when he is about to set out on an important undertaking.</P>
<P>3. Tables of destiny, consulted in cases of illness.</P>
<P>4. Tables of marriage, employed to arrive at a knowledge of the chances of happiness afforded by some proposed matrimonial alliance.</P>
<P>5. A soothsaying table, with numerous figures and sentences.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">1. <I>The elements and cyclic animals</I>.</P>
<P>Rules and regulations connected with or having reference to the calendar, as is the case with the table here described,</P>
<P>{p. 294}</P>
<P>are mostly combinations of the figures used in chronology, viz. the twelve cyclic animals and the five elements. The technical term for such a table is Gabtsis (see p. 274). In the present case their divinatory combination forms part of a large roll not unlike in form to the documents of classical antiquity, on which are also delineated most of the diagrams subsequently described. It came from Lh&aacute;ssa, and Hermann, meeting with it at Darj&iacute;ling, seized the opportunity and bought it. The Gabtsis is composed of eight lines.</P>

<P>Each number has a colour which is not a different one for every one of the nine numbers, but which is never changed for the same number; 1 is white; 9 is red; 8 is white; 7 is red; 6 is white; 5 is yellow; 4 is green; 3 is blue; 2 is black. These numerals so coloured are called "the nine blots," in Tibetan Meba gu, in Mongolian Mangga.[1] The succession of the Mebas is considered as important in many respects; its chief use is to indicate the years particularly dangerous to existence, which, according to the notions of the Tibetans return every tenth year; these are the years, they say, in which "the birth-meba has to consolidate." As birth-meba is taken that number in the fifth line (the second line of the series here detailed), which happens to be just beneath the animal in the sign of which a man has been born; and in the arrangement described this Meba returns every tenth year, and is also the central number of nine compartments, the single numbers of which are exactly identical with those of a group ten, twenty years, &amp;c., distant. The dangers of these critical years, coinciding with the "consolidations of the birth-meba," can be averted by the ceremony Ruibal chenpoi dokjed, "to turn back (the evils) in the name of the great tortoise,"[2]</P>

<P>In the <I>seventh line</I> thirty sentences had been written, but they had been almost entirely blotted out already when Hermann got the original.</P>
<P>In the <I>eighth line</I> the heads of the sixty animals are repeated, two in one compartment, to indicate the phases of the moon.</P>
<P>Another table for the same purpose obtained by Adolphe in Gn&aacute;ri Kh&oacute;rsum has the form of a square; round a tortoise in the Centre are grouped three times the twelve cyclic animals; in the first series each is repeated once, in the two other series they are repeated five times, to constitute the number of sixty. As a curious deviation from the list of the animals given above, I have to mention that, instead of the ox, we meet an elephant. Between the two spaces filled with the animals, are traced the 180 compartments, tinted with the colour of the Mebas and containing the corresponding numerals. In other divisions of the Square the symbols of the sun, the moon, and the planets Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn (see p. 289) are added, alternating with Squares containing the nine Mebas.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">2. <I>The spirits of the season</I>.</P>
<P>Amongst the causes of the luckiness and unluckiness of days are included the periodical migrations of the spirits inhabiting the regions above the earth. The two kinds of spirits, the good and evil ones, are supposed to shift their</P>
<P>{p. 299}</P>
<P>abodes, partly every day, partly contemporaneously with the phases of the moon, the commencement of a new season, &amp;c. They perform their migrations with unequal velocity, and therefore, the combination of the spirits varies for every day. It is very important to man, as is believed, to know which kind of spirits have arrived the very day on which he begins an undertaking; if the good spirits are more numerous than the bad ones, the day will be a lucky one, and the more so if the man's tutelary deity is amongst the good spirits. This belief naturally offers a wide field of intrigue to the Lamas, who alone are able to decide the actual movements of the spirits. Amongst the evil spirits particular attention is to be paid to the abode of four demons, who, in astrological maps of the sky, are typified by the following figures: a black dog; a monster with a human body and the tail of a dragon, meaning a Mah&ocirc;raga, in Tibetan Tophye chenpo; a man on horseback; and, finally, the fabulous bird Garuda. Their images are always encircled by a double square frame; the inner one is divided into twelve compartments, in each of which the name of a cyclic animal is written; the outer frame contains Dh&acirc;ran&icirc;s supposed to be able and willing to hinder obnoxious attempts of the evil spirits. To each of these demons also a season is assigned; the black dog rules the spring, the Mah&ocirc;raga the summer, the man on horseback the autumn, the bird Garuda the winter.</P>
<P>The linear arrangement of such a table is here given: the squares show the position of the respective four demons, the surrounding numbers the succession of the names of</P>
<P>{p. 300}</P>
<P>the twelve cyclic animals; the outer space is that containing the Dh&acirc;r&acirc;n&icirc;s.</P>
<P>###</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">3. <I>Figures and Oracles for the Character of a day</I>.</P>
<P>A day which, according to its number in the series of the days of a year, should be lucky, may for the individual man become fatal by circumstances originating from the time of his birth and other important epochs in his life. But there are days which are lucky under all circumstances, whilst others are invariably unfavourable. The stability as well as the variable character of the thirty days of each month is illustrated by tables divided into thirty principle compartments; the compartments show the symbolical figures of the single days, and below each is written a mystical sentence which reveals its character. Such a table allows one to predict whether the chances of an undertaking are increased by the character of the</P>
<P>{p. 301}</P>
<P>day, or whether man needs the assistance of a Lama, to tell him from which spirit or from what direction danger threatens, as also to indicate the means of averting it. The answer is considered to be derived from most complicated computations; the cyclic animals and the elements of the present year, the abode of the tutelary deity, the birth-meba, and many other things must be taken into consideration. Only the most expert astrologers are believed to have the necessary knowledge, and consequently the remuneration demanded for their assistance and cooperation is high; so that none but the great and wealthy possess the means of getting indicated the reasons which render one day lucky, another unlucky. Chibu Lama said that such tables were generally consulted only by Rajas, and that copies of the book in which this kind of calculation is detailed are very rare in every Buddhist country; no copy had to be was in S&iacute;kkim.</P>
<P>The table which will be here described also forms part of the great roll which was bought by Hermann during his travels in 1855, who even obtained some explanations about the general meaning of the sentences. When I continued the analysis, first by getting transcribed the sentences which in the original are written with small characters, which could be done but very imperfectly, as by the frequent use of the roll about one-half of the squares had become quite illegible by friction, I found, also here, so many words used not introduced into Tibetan literature as known hitherto, that all that could be deciphered with sufficient accuracy was</P>
<P>{p. 302}</P>
<P>some few words; these I add in brackets to the verbal native information.</P>
<P>I now give the description of the table. In the upper left-hand corner (in space No. I.) Manjusr&icirc;[1] is represented sitting upon a throne; in the opposite corner (in No. II.) is the sword of wisdom, an emblem of his superior knowledge. Each of these two figures occupies the longitudinal space of two squares and the breadth of ones. The rest of the plate is filled up by the following thirty figures and their corresponding sentences.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">TABLES FOR DIRECTION IN IMPORTANT UNDERTAKINGS.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">1. <I>The square tortoise</I>.</P>
<P>The essential figure of such tables is a tortoise, the feet of which are often drawn as hands (see Plates XIV., XV., XVI.); its shell is divided into numerous compartments, in each of which an allegorical figure is traced symbolizing</P>
<P>{p. 305}</P>
<P>some part or direction of the universe. The tortoise is considered by the Tibetan Buddhists to support the universe; and it is in allusion to this belief that it is generally drawn surrounded by water, signifying the ocean which washes the shores of the different continents. The legend having reference hereto, and which Pallas[1] also found to be spread amongst the Mongolian tribes, is this: As often as the universe, after its destruction, has to be re-moulded, the chaos, a fluid and incoherent mass, is somewhat dried by the winds, and the liquid ingredients separated from the solid. At the time of the creation of the present world, Manjusr&icirc; caused a tortoise of enormous size to emanate from him and to float in this chaos. Then considering, as god of wisdom, that the continents to be formed needed a solid basis, he rose up into the atmosphere and discharged a golden arrow, which struck the tortoise in its right side causing it to turn over and sink down through the chaotic mass, dropping blood from its wound, leaving behind its excrements, and vomiting fire, thus increasing the elementary parts dissolved in the waters; and when the consolidation took place, it furnished the basis of the universe, which now rests upon the flat under side of its shell.</P>
<P>This surface is quite distinctly characterised, in all representations I have before me, as the under shell, <I>not</I> as the back of the tortoise. The head is turned upwards to show the face, and what makes it more evident still,</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Compare Pallas, "Mongol. V&ouml;lkerschaften," Vol. II., p. 21. The fullest account of it was told by the Lamas to stand in the Tibetan book Shecha rabsal "history of science."]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 306}</P>
<P>the human hands connected with the tortoise, have distinctly a position of the thumb which shows the lower part to the observer. For astrological purposes this lower part of the tortoise-shell is drawn either square or circular, which necessarily also causes a very different arrangement of its component parts. The shell here described is a square one. The. accompanying sketch shows the distribution of the compartments; the numbers I have inserted have reference to the figures, which will be subsequently explained.</P>
<P>###</P>
<P>In the centre is traced a circle with eight Mebas in this order: ###; the central square is here empty, but in other diagrams of the tortoise it contains a numeral. A square frame surrounding the circle is the next division, and contains compartments with the twelve cyclic animals (their position is indicated in the sketch by the numerals from 1 to 12); it also contains the symbolical signs of the four principal corners of the universe: No. 13, fire (flames) = north; No. 14, iron (two angles meaning the Phurbu) = east; No. 15, water (waves) = south; No. 16, tree (leaves) = west. The rest of the shell is divided into eight principal divisions</P>
<P>{p. 307}</P>
<P>(No. 17 to 24 of the sketch), which are distinguished by a frame of double lines; each is subdivided again into nine compartments. In the central part of every one of these groups we find a mystical sign, one of the "eight symbolical forms," in Tibetan Parkha chakja chad, meaning one of the eight regions of the universe, of which there are ten in all.[1] For astrological purposes mystical names are given to them, and generally they are symbolized by the following signs (see also Plate XIV., XV.):</P>
<P>### North. Li, fire. (In No. 17.)</P>
<P>### North-east. Khon, earth. (In No. 18.)</P>
<P>### East. Da, iron. (In No. 19)</P>
<P>### South-east. Khen, heaven. (In No. 20.)</P>
<P>### South. Kham, water. (In No. 21.)</P>
<P>### South-west. Gin, mountain. (In No. 22.)</P>
<P>### West. Zin, tree. (In No. 23.)</P>
<P>### North-west. Zon, air. (In No. 24.)[2]</P>
<P>These signs, however, are not exclusively introduced in this form: other types may be occasionally considered</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See p. 126, 259.</P>
<P>2. Pallas, "Mongol . V&ouml;lkerschaften," Vol. II., p. 229, has likewise inserted the allegorical names for the eight corners of the universe: his names are the same as above, but the region they typify differs. I shall have occasion in the next pages to prove, by the place which they in a occuppy {<I>???</I>} compass, that in their explanation he is wrong.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 308}</P>
<P>to be more useful, or more damaging to the influence of evil spirits; and famous astrologers do not unfrequently invent quite new ones; a specimen of such a deviation is that printed on Plate XVI. where the signs are these:</P>

<P>The remaining eight figures in the smaller squares are in each group the same; they are likewise symbols of the eight regions, and have besides each a mystical meaning. The trident is the north; the Phurbu is the east; by five dots, ###, five of the dreaded demons are symbolized whose appearance causes "untimely death," and other misfortunes; they mean the south. The Dorje is the west. Amongst the other figures parts of the human body partly male partly female may still be particularly mentioned. Their relative position varies, and each different combination shows the region desired for a specific purpose, such as whither to direct the prayers and the Phurbu in order to ward off successfully the demons; what direction a bridegroom or a warrior must take on leaving the house, &amp;c.</P>

<P>In order to discover the region required, various circumstances have to be taken into consideration; of the numerous books in which they are detailed the greatest variety of rules is contained in the books Yangsal Domi (already quoted p. 280), Chungpa kundus tsis, and Thangshin-gi tsis. The astrologers are very reserved in communicating these laws; this would make their art too popular and would deprive it of the character of sublime mysticism and science, with which they now array it. All I can say is this: A quantity of numerals corresponding to the number of years of the questioner is inscribed successively in the nine compartments of a circle in the order in which the symbolical names of the quarters of the world are enumerated in the following verses:--</P><DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The centre means the nadir, the tenth of the regions of the universe which the Tibetans acknowledge (the ninth region, the zenith, is omitted). From the number which takes the place of the nadir, the succession of the others depends; which number has to occupy the centre I do not know, I have been only informed that attention must be paid to the sex, as the central number is one with males, another with females.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Tibetan text is printed sub No. I., 1, in Plate XVIII.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 310} When the central number has become known, the other numerals are grouped so that the next higher is written in the compartment heaven, the next higher in the compartment iron, and so on as detailed in the verses. If the number 9 is reached, it is not 10 which follows but the series is continued again with 1, 2, &amp;c., till the quantity of the numerals inscribed is identical with the number of years of the questioner. The highly mystical character of the rules concerning the distribution of the Mebas seems to be well illustrated by those respecting the influence of the sex upon the calculation; they are brought in the form of verses, and run thus:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"The year of man must be counted by the sign of the heaven, turning like Bon,<BR>
"The year of women like the doctrine (chos)."[1]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>For facilitating the correct inscription of the numerals in the succession required, such representations of the tortoise have not only in their own centre a circle with nine compartments and the numerals inscribed in due order, but beneath the tortoise an appendix of eight other circles is added, which show the due succession of the numerals in case any one of the nine numerals should fall into the central position. Also our large roll contains, in Tibetan characters, the following eight combinations bordered by circles:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">2. <I>Allegorical figures and dice</I>.</P>
<P>A rectangular table 6 inches long, and 4 inches broad, divided into 24 parts.</P>
<P>###</P>
<P>The squares 1, 2, 3, 4 are filled up by representations of the twelve cyclic animals, in groups so arranged that one animal is ridden by three others. They are considered here as introductory figures and have their particular importance when a marriage is contracted, but not in reference to sickness; they shall be explained in the subsequent section, IV. Squares 5 to 16 are the spaces which contain the objects and sentences consulted in illness; they are: 5. Two coniferous trees. 6. Buildings during inundation. 7. Two coniferous trees. 8. One tree. 9. Two sacred buildings. 10. Two eyes. The sentences in 10 to 16 are written in running-hand with abbreviations, so that a literal transliteration was not possible for square 12. These sentences' follow in the succession my diagram gives:--</P>
<P>11. The flourishing (green) tree of life will be broken now or later--No. 1.</P>
<P>12. [The golden tree will now be broken].--This, however, stands under the image of the buildings in inundation, in which no allusion to a tree could be discovered.</P>
<P>13. The tree of the blue colour of turquoise will be broken now or later--No. 2.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Number 12, of which the exact translation could not be given, is marked by brackets. In the other sentences the numerals after "No." have reference to the Tibetan text in Plate XVIII., II.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 315}</P>
<P>14. The tree <I>d</I>Pag-<I>b</I>sam-shing[1] will be broken now or later.--No. 3.</P>
<P>15. The celebrated houses and enclosures will be destroyed now or later.--No. 4.</P>
<P>16. Now or later the eyes of death shall meet you.--No. 5.[2]</P>
<P>The spaces 19 to 24 represent the six surfaces of a die. The dots upon dice used for soothsaying purposes show here. the following arrangment, one half of the dots being white, the other black.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">###</P>
<P>The dice are either cubes, like the European ones, or rectangular parallepidedons, sometimes comparatively very long. The latter, in consequence of their form, have two sides blank.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">IV.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TABLES FOR MARRIAGE.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">1. <I>Table with numerals</I>.</P>
<P>One diagram of this kind shows a table of nine squares, each divided again into nine spaces; the central is a rectangle, in which is inscribed a short sentence; the eight surrounding</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. It is a fabulous tree which accomplishes every wish. Schmidt, "Tibet. Lexicon."</P>
<P>2. A great number of similar oracles have been compiled in the book Jed-tho yangi zamatog "handbook of oracles."]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 316}</P>
<P>spaces contain each the number of a Meba. The arrangement of the numerals is as given in the accompanying figure.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">###</P>
<P>The sentences in the rectangles were explained to Hermann to run thus:[1]</P>
<P>I. Medicine of the sky, true.</P>
<P>II. Medicine of the sky, middle.</P>
<P>III. Medicine of the sky, partly true.</P>
<P>IV. Imaginarily true according to man's knowledge.</P>
<P>V. Of middle fortune, mediocre (the Lama said: Imaginarily true, but doubtful).</P>
<P>VI. Imaginarily true, and bad by imagination.</P>
<P>VII. Utterly bad.</P>
<P>VIII. Likely to be bad.</P>
<P>IX. A little better than the regular bad ones.</P>
<P>This table is consulted by the parents of the young people to be married, who throw a sacred seed upon it;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The inscriptions had been so much injured that I could only verify the fifth.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 317}</P>
<P>the inscription of the square upon which the seed rests, is taken as the general character of the answer as to the felicity of the ensuing marriage, but the answer allows a variety of interpretations, according to the birth Meba of the young people, and to the Meba of the square, if the seed happens to rest upon a numeral and not upon the inscription. Also the elements under which they were born, are taken into consideration. In this respect it is universally admitted that the circumstance, that the elements under which the young people were born are not the same would entail discord and strife, if the element which is superior in power were not neutralized by ceremonies which, of course, can only be performed with efficacy by the Lamas. The relations of the elements are detailed in the following sentences; their Tibetan text is given in Plate. XIX., II.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"The mother of wood is water, the son of wood fire;<BR>
"The enemy of wood is iron, the friend of wood earth;<BR>
"The mother of water is iron, the son of water wood;<BR>
"The enemy of water is earth, the friend of water fire;<BR>
"The mother of iron is earth, the son of iron water;<BR>
"The enemy of iron is fire, the friend of iron water;<BR>
"The mother of earth is fire, the son of earth iron;<BR>
The enemy of earth is wood, the friend of earth iron."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>These notions[1] are evidently founded upon considerations on the conditions of growth and decay of the existing objects; for wood, or the plants, grow in</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Comp. Pallas, 1. c., p. 236.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 318}</P>
<P>the earth and are fed by water; wood furnishes the material for fire, but wood, or trees, are felled by iron. Iron (shovels) are indispensable for irrigation-canals, to furnish the plants (wood) with the necessary water, of which, however, they are deprived to a certain extent by the earth, into which a part sinks and is lost.[1] Fire again renders possible the use of water for cooking, and thus increases its importance for man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">2. <I>Table with cyclic animals</I>.</P>
<P>All the tribes of Central Asia[2] suppose that the different natures of the elements which constitute the cycle of twelve years, cause mutual affection or aversity; the rules, however, which the Tibetans have established on this head, are very arbitrary; they believe, <I>e. g.</I> that the bird would pick the horse, &amp;c. They speak of six varieties of relative feelings, viz.: very great affection; mediocre affection; indifference; disinclination; great hatred; deadly hatred. Deadly hatred is incurable, and under such auspices young people should, properly, not be permitted to marry; but if the parties are wealthy and liberal, the hatred may be prevented from breaking out. All other relations of the animals can be modified--the influence of the unfavourable weakened or totally counteracted, that of the favourable strengthened and increased.</P>
<P>Diagrams in the divisions of which such groups of animals are formed, are very frequent; their arrangement</P>

<P>is either that the head of two animals are delineated within one division, or that their names are inscribed instead: occasionally also an animal is ridden by a monster in human shape with the heads of one or even more of the cyclic animals. Whether the hatred or disinclination will become fatal to the couple, is determined by the casting of dice.</P>

<P>Another combination shows the animals which <I>may</I> but do not necessarily prove unfavourable; it comprises four divisions, and in each is seen an animal ridden by a monster with the heads of three animals. In the first division the hog is ridden by the bird, serpent and dog; in the second the ape by the mouse, sheep, and tiger; in the third the tiger by the horse, ox and ape; in the fourth the serpent by the dragon, the hog and hare.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">A SOOTHSAYING TABLE WITH NUMEROUS FIGURES AND SENTENCES.</P>
<P>It was but after great hesitation on the part of the Lamas that Adolphe and Robert obtained this table at M&aacute;ngnang, in Gn&aacute;ri Kh&oacute;rsum; they were repeatedly assured that no other copy could be procured, except after much delay, direct from Lh&aacute;ssa. As my brothers did not succeed in obtaining information from the Lamas of M&aacute;ngnang concerning its application, I addressed myself to Mr. Schiefner, in order to obtain details about analogous objects; but though he inquired with his usual kindness about such materials, I remained limited to the translation of the inscriptions, and, for the interpretation of the figures, to the analogy of the forms with those on other tables.</P>
<P>{p. 321}</P>
<P>The original is 21 inches long, and 18 inches broad; its principal part is divided into 78 rectangles which contain either a figure, or a sentence, or both combined; some, however, are empty. Along its sides two vertical stripes are left to receive explanatory directions for the use of the table; of these, however, one is empty. In order to facilitate the explanation, I give as usual the outlines of the compartments; where a number is omitted, the space is empty.</P>

<P>Having arrived at the conclusion of the descriptive part of this volume, I may be allowed to add still a few remarks, though of a general bearing, in allusion to the contributions which the inquiries into Buddhism have afforded for the explanation of monumental remains in Europe, particularly in Norway, as well as for the interpretation of ancient mythological terminology. Prof. Holmboe of Stockholm, when comparing the tumuli and long walls extant in many parts of Norway with the Topes in India and Afghanistan and the Chortens and Manis of Tibet, found so many surprising analogies, that he at length declared that, in his opinion, it is highly probable, "the teachers of Buddhism advanced as far as Scandinavia, after having passed through the vast provinces</P>
<P>{p. 328}</P>
<P>of Russia."[1] And, what may be more unexpected still, even in Mexico Buddhism was discovered to have had followers as late as the 13th century, a circumstance made evident from the details and descriptions contained in a Chinese author of the end of the fifteenth century of our era concerning "the far distant land into which pious men and heavy storms had transferred the sacred doctrine."[2]</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. For details see Holmboe, "Traces de Buddhisme en Norv&egrave;ge," p. 69. Even the name of the god Odin, or Wodan, the highest god in German mythology, Holmboe says, may be referred to Buddhist terms and to the Sanskrit word <I>Budh</I> and its derivations <I>Buddha</I>, <I>Bodhin</I>, <I>Bodh&acirc;n</I>, <I>Bodhant</I>. The change of <I>b</I> into <I>v</I> has taken place already in Sanskrit, and the dropping of the <I>v</I> in the ancient language of Norway is said to be very frequent in words in which it is followed by <I>o</I> or <I>u</I>.--A brief summary, with critical remarks, of Holmboe's book is given by Rajendralal Mitra in Journ. As. Soc. Beng., Vol. XXVII., p. 46.</P>
<P>2 See Neumann, as quoted by Lassen, "Indische Alterthumskunde," Vol. IV., p. 749.--In the United States of America, too, artificial mounds have been found bearing such a curious analogy with the tumuli in Norway, that it has been suggested by American antiquarians, that a people coming from Norway discovered America already about the year 1000 of our era. Rafn, as quoted by Holmboe, p. 23.]</P>
