<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">TRANSLATION OF AN ADDRESS TO THE BUDDHAS OF CONFESSION</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TRANSLATION AND EXPLANATORY REMARKS.</P>
<P>IN the chapter on "Metempsychosis" I have already alluded to the various means of purification from sins, a very efficacious one, it will be remembered, consisting in .the supplication of the deities. I have likewise there referred to the addresses offered up to the Buddhas of confession, which are contained in various compilations of prayers. A sacred treatise of this nature forms the subject of the present chapter. The original I found concealed in a Chorten my brother Hermann had obtained from the Lama at Saimonb&oacute;ng, in S&iacute;kkim;[1] it is written in small characters (the Vumed) on two sheets</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Chorten stood on the altar in the Lama's praying-room already when Hooker was there. See the View of the interior of the house of the Lama at Saimonb&oacute;ng in his "Himalayan Journals."]</P>

<P>of unequal size. The larger is about four feet square, its height being two feet four inches, its breadth one foot nine inches; the smaller has the same breadth) but its height is only six inches, giving a surface of 7/8 square foot. These two sheets were lying one upon the other, but separated by grains of barley interposed between them. They were wound round a wooden four-sided obelisk which filled the central part of the Chorten. The four sides of this obelisk were covered with Dh&acirc;ran&icirc; inscriptions.</P>
<P>As the size of the two sheets does not allow of my reproducing here this invocation of the Buddhas of confession in the form. of a facsimile, I preferred giving it transcribed in the head characters in the ordinary form of Tibetan books, at the end of the chapter. The contents of the two parts are separated by a distance left between them; the beginning of the second part is besides also marked in the Tibetan text by the recurrence of the initial sign.[1]</P>
<P>Its full title runs thus: Digpa thamchad shagpar terchoi, "Repentance of all sins, doctrine of the hidden treasure."[2] The words ter-choi were illegible in the sentence at the head of the treatise, and it was only through their occurring at the foot of the larger leaf in connexion with the rest of the phrase that the hiatus could be filled up. Here also the other words preceding them had suffered considerable injury, but the general</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. In the English translation the words in parenthesis are rather explanatory paraphrases, than literal translations of the Tibetan.</P>
<P>2. <I>S</I>dig-pa "sin, vice;" tham<I>s</I>-chad "all;" <I>b</I>shags-pa "repentant confession;" <I>r</I>, the sign of the locative, is often used in stead of the genetive {<I>sic</I>} sign (comp. Foucaux, Grain. Tib., p. 94); <I>g</I>ter "a treasury;" chhos "the doctrine."]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 124}</P>
<P>context and the few letters still decipherable proved sufficient to remove all doubt that the title had been repeated. Another name for the petition, and one which we several times meet with in the text, is Digshag ser chi pugri, "the golden razor which takes away sins,"[1] this designation evidently signifying its extraordinary efficacy in delivering the sinner.</P>
<P>The larger leaf commences with a general laudation of the Buddhas--past, present, and to come--who are considered to have approached nearest to perfection; then fifty-one Buddhas are mentioned each by name; of some the region is Stated in which they dwell, to others is added the number of their births from the moment in which they entered the Buddha career down to the time when they obtained the Buddhaship. Sins are said to be annihilated by reading or uttering the names of these Buddhas, and the sins are specified from which each Buddha has the power to purify. The wickedness of the human race, which caused the destruction of the universe, is alluded to, and the prophecy is made that man shall have recourse to this treatise and derive from it great advantages.</P>
<P>The second, smaller leaf, begins with the words: "Enshrined in the sacred box at the time of the uttering of benedictions," which refer to the usual inauguration ceremonies of religious buildings, as also to the blessings pronounced on such solemn occasions. Their effects upon the salvation of man, and the advantages</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. <I>G</I>ser "gold;" kyi, chi, is the sign of the genitive me; <I>s</I>pu-gri "a razor."]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 125}</P>
<P>which the inhabitants of the monastery shall derive from repeating them, are also again noticed. It concludes with four Dh&acirc;ran&icirc;s.</P>
<P>The address styles itself a Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na S&ucirc;tra (in Tibetan, Thegpa chenpoi do), under which we should also have to class it from the nature of its contents.[1] The addressing of imaginary Buddhas and the admission of a magical influence of prayers upon the deity implored is particularly to be mentioned in evidence of its being written in this period of mystic modification of Buddhism.[2] We may also, with equal right, regard it as a translation from an ancient Sanskrit work, on account of the occurring of the title in Sanskrit.</P>
<P>The personal names of the Buddhas, and the Tibetan terms explained in the notes, are given in exact transliteration, and are not reprinted in the GLOSSARY OF TIBETAN TERMS, APPENDIX B., if they occur in the text; the native spelling of the other words may be looked for in this Glossary.</P>

<P>3. My original is injured in this place, and the Sanskrit name cannot be read--It is a curious custom, differing from translations in European languages, that books which have been translated from the Sanskrit have frequently two titles, the Sanskrit and the Tibetan one. Some larger works of the Kanjur also receive an additional title in the Tibetan dialect called Dulva zhi, "the basis of religious discipline." See Csoma, "Analysis," As. Res.. Vol. XX., p. 44.]</P>

Comp. pp. 4, 15.--In the sequel I shall translate De-<I>b</I>zhin-<I>g</I>sheg<I>s</I>-pa by its Sanskrit equivalent Tath&acirc;gata, the literal rendering of the passage making the phrase inconveniently long.</P>
<P>Similar sentences begin religious treatises; the Kanjur <I>e. g.</I> has in the first page three images representing S&acirc;kyamuni, with his son on his left, and one of his chief disciples on the right the following legends being written respectively under each: "Salutation to the prince of the Munis; salutation to the son of Sh&acirc;rik&acirc;; salutation to Grachen dzin (Sanskrit L&acirc;hula)." The title page of the work is followed by the Salutation to the three holy ones. Csoma, "Analysis of the Dulva class of the Kanjur," As. Res., Vol. XX., p. 45. Our historical document relating to the foundation of the H&iacute;mis monastery, an abreviated {<I>sic</I>} translation of which is appended to the chapter on monasteries, commences with the words: "Hail! praise and salutation to the teachers!"</P>
<P>2. The three periods are the past, the present and the future; the Buddhas of the past are those who had preached the law and have now returned to Nirv&acirc;na; the Buddha of the present time is S&acirc;kyamuni, the last of the Buddhas that have yet appeared; the Buddhas of the future time are the B&ocirc;dhisattvas, the candidates for Buddhaship. The Buddhas of the three periods include all the Buddhas.</P>

These ten quarters of the world are: north; north-east; east; south-east; south; south-west; west; north-west; the quarter above the zenith; the quarter below the nadir. Each region is inhabited by its own Buddhas and gods, and to know their feelings towards a particular man is considered of the greatest importance. Compare for details Chapter XVII. No. 2.--A totally different meaning must be attached to Sa-<I>b</I>chu-pa "the ten earths," a term equivalent to the Sanskrit Dasabh&ucirc;mi, referring to the ten regions or degrees of perfection which a B&ocirc;dhisattva has to pass in succession in order to attain the Buddha perfection.

When a Buddha leaves the earth, he loses the faculty of embodying himself again in human shape; the Nirm&acirc;nak&acirc;ya body (Tib. Prulpai ku) in which he has contributed to the welfare and salvation of mankind in the periods preceding the attainment of the Buddha perfection, dies with him, and does not enter Nirv&acirc;na.

<P>2. An allusion to the numerous descents of Sh&acirc;kya-thub-pa, or S&acirc;kyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, who, in common with all candidates for the Buddhaship previous to their final elevation, has passed through countless probationary stages, during which period greater merit is accumulated by most extraordinary works. The life of the Buddhas in anterior existences is related at large in the sacred books styled J&acirc;takas, not a few of these tales being identical with the fables of the Greek Aesop. Hardy, "Manual of Buddhism," p. 100; Burnouf, "Introduction," pp. 61, 555. The previous re-births of S&acirc;kyamuni are in most of the sacred books variously estimated from 500 to 550. Upham, "History and Doctrine of Buddhism," Vol. III., p. 296; Foucaux, "Rgy chher rol pa," Vol. II., p. 34; Hardy, "Manual," l. c. But there are also many phrases to be met with tending to establish their infinity, and the Buddha himself is reported to have said: "It is impossible to reckon the bodies I have possessed." Foe koue ki, pp. 67, 348; Hodgson, "Illustrations," p. 86. The number in the text is accordingly an instance rather of the latter belief, and the term khrag might be an abreviation {<I>sic</I>} from khrag-khrig, "a hundred thousand millions," which is also used to signify any indefinitely large number. See Csoma's Dictionary, <I>voce</I> Khrag-khrig.]</P>

This name, "the luminous" is applied to an imaginary Buddha who, according to Turner and Hardy, is said to have been the twenty-fourth teacher of the Buddha law previous to S&acirc;kyamuni, to whom he was the first to give a definite assurance of his future Buddhaship. Turner, "Extracts from the Attakata," Journ. As. Soc. Beng., Vol. VIII., p. 789; Hardy's Manual, p. 94. In Hodgson's list (Illustrations, p. 135), however, he is the first Buddha of the actual period and the ninth predecessor of S&acirc;kyamuni--Hardy's texts allege him to have lived 100,000 years; the Nippon Pantheon (by Hofmann in v.

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. These are Indian priests who were very celebrated for their zeal in the propagation of Buddhism; with the exception of Lugrub, the first of this series, they all took an active part in spreading its doctrines throughout Tibet. Lugrub, in Sanskrit N&acirc;g&acirc;rjuna, is regarded as the founder of the Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na system. See p. 30. Guru Padma is the famous teacher Padma Sambhava, who was sent for by king Thisrong de tsan, and is said to have reached Tibet A.D. 747. Bimala mitra also came to Tibet in accordance, with an invitation from this king. See Schmidt in "Ssanang Ssetsen," p. 356. Na-ro-va, who is enumerated before Bimala mitra, must doubtless have been contemporaneous with him and Padma Sambhava. Pandita Atisha, the last of the series, has a great reputation for re-establishing Buddhism after the persecutions of its followers under the reigns of Langdharma and big successors (902-71).</P>
<P>2. The Tibetan <I>b</I>la-ma-dam-pa-<I>b</I>rgyud, is an honorary title applied to the priests with whom originated a specific system of Buddhism. In a subsequent sentence, and also in the document relating to the foundation of the H&iacute;mis monastery, we shall find them called "Foundation-Lamas," in Tibetan <I>r</I>tsa-va'i-<I>b</I>la-ma.</P>
<P>3. In Tibetan <I>b</I>skal-ba-<I>s</I>nyig-ma, According to the notions of the Buddhists, as well as of the Brahmans, the universe, which is without beginning or end, is periodically destroyed and constructed again, these revolutions passing through four different periods, or Kalpas, viz.: the periods of formation, and of the continuance of formation; and those of the destruction, and disappearance of the universe, Here the Kalpa of destruction is referred to, and it is foretold that man shall obtain absolution from his sins by reading this book. The universe is dissolved and consumed by the powers of fire, water, and wind, which effect its entire destruction in sixty-four attacks upon its substance. The moral condition of man previous to the several agencies coming into action is stated as follows: "Before the destruction by water, cruelty or violence prevails in the world; before that by fire, licentiousness, and before that by wind, ignorance. When licentiousness has prevailed, men are cut off by disease; when violence, by turning their weapons against each other, and when ignorance, by famine." Hardy, "Manual of Buddhism," pp. 28-35; Schmidt, M&eacute;m. de l'Acad. de P&eacute;tersb., Vol. II., pp. 58-68.]</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This phrase is to be understood m a sort of prediction that the temples shall be desecrated by worldly negociations; {<I>sic</I>} for it is in the temples that are put up the three representatives (Tibetan Tensumni) of the Buddha, his precepts, and his mercy.</P>
<P>The Buddha is figured as a statue, a bas-relief, or a picture. The pictures hang down from the cross-beams of the roof, or are traced on the walls; the statues and bas-reliefs show him in a sitting attitude, and are placed behind the altar in a recess. The precepts which he bequeathed to man after his departure from earth, are symbolized by a book, which lies upon a lower step of the altar, or rests upon a shelf suspended from the roof. His mercy, or unlimited charity, which enabled him to obtain the sublime rank of a Buddha, in order to lead man to salvation, is signified by a Chorten, a pyramidal chest containing relies, which always occupies a prominent place upon the altar. See Csoma, "Grammar" p. 173, "Dictionary," <I>voce</I> <I>r</I>ten;--also Schmidt's Lexicon. For further details about images of gods see Chapter XIV.; for books, see p. 80; Chortens, Chapter XIII. For the place which these objects occupy in temples, I may refer to the Chapter on the temples, and to the view of the interior of the temple at Mangn&aacute;ng, in Gn&aacute;ri Kh&oacute;rsum, by my brother Adolphe in the Atlas to the "Results of a Scientific Mission."</P>
<P>2. The term <I>d</I>ge-slong is applied to ordained priests, who, however, are generally called by the more honourable title of Lama (<I>b</I>la-ma), a distinction strictly belonging only to the superiors of convents. The Gelongs must not care for riches or worldly prosperity; their breaking down inhabited places may mean, perhaps, their fighting against other monasteries or against rich men in general.</P>

<P>5. Deliverance from existence is only the consequence of good actions; but suicide is also in the opinion of the Buddhist a bad action, and has a re-birth in a lower degree as one of its consequences, since the sins for the expiation of which the present existence had to be endured, are not yet atoned for, and also a new crime is committed. In the period of misery alluded to in the text, however, also this moral law will be overlooked.</P>
<P>6. By Mani the famous six-syllable prayer Om mani padme hum, "O, the Jewel in the Lotus: Amen," is to be understood; this allusion in the text refers to its conversion into a popular song.</P>

The Dzos are one of the few mixed species which are capable of propagation, and they outnumber in some valleys the pare Yaks.</P>

<P>3. This phrase refers, as may be seen from the sequel, to the inferior signs of a Buddha's beauty. They are generally stated to be 80 in number, but other books, as <I>e. g.</I> the Rgya-chher-rol-pa (translated by Foucaux, Vol. II., p. 108) give 84, which, in the present treatise, have been multiplied by 1000. The number of 84,000 is a most favourite one in Buddhist cosmogony and seems to he used in the same way as Khrag-khrig, "a hundred thousand millions" (p. 130), and the Chinese Wan, or 10,000 (Ideler, "Ueber die Zeitrechnung der Chinesen," p. 10), as the designation of an infinite number. The extent, thickness, and diameter of the sakwalas can always be divided by 8; the prolongation of the age of mankind continues for 84,000 years.
