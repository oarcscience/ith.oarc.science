<p>Joshu asked Nansen: "What is the path?"</p>  
<p>Nansen said: "Everyday life is the path."</p>  
<p>Joshu asked: "Can it be studied?"</p>  
<p>Nansen said: "If you try to study, you will be far away from it."</p>  
<p>Joshu asked: "If I do not study, how can I know it is the path?"</p>  
<p>Nansen said: "The path does not belong to the perception world, neither does it belong to the nonperception world. Cognition is a delusion and noncognition is senseless. If you want to reach the true path beyond doubt, place yourself in the same freedom as sky. You name it neither good nor not-good."</p>  
<p>At these words Joshu was enlightened.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Nansen could melt Joshu's frozen doubts at once when Joshu asked his questions. I doubt though if Joshu reached the point  that Nansen did. He needed thirty more years of study.</p>
