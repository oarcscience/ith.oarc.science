### 7. Joshu Washes the Bowl

A monk told Joshu: "I have just entered the monastery. Please teach me."

Joshu asked: "Have you eaten your rice porridge?"

The monk replied: "I have eaten."

Joshu said: "Then you had better wash your bowl."

At that moment the monk was enlightened.

 

*Mumon's comment:* Joshu is the man who opens his mouth and shows his
heart. I doubt if this monk really saw Joshu's heart. I hope he did not
mistake the bell for a pitcher.

*It is too clear and so it is hard to see.  
A dunce once searched for a fire with a lighted lantern.  
Had he known what fire was,  
He could have cooked his rice much sooner*.
