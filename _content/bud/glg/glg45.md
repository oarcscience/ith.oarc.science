### 45. Who Is He?

Hoen said: "The past and future Buddhas, both are his servants. Who is
he?"

 

*Mumon's comment:* If you realize clearly who he is, it is as if you met
your own father on a busy street. There is no need to ask anyone whether
or not your recognition is true.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Do not fight with another's bow and arrow.  
Do not ride another's horse.  
Do not discuss another's faults.  
Do not interfere with another's work*.
