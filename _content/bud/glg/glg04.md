### 4. A Beardless Foreigner

Wakuan complained when he saw a picture of bearded Bodhidharma: "Why
hasn't that fellow a beard?"

 

*Mumon's comment:* If you want to study Zen, you must study it with your
heart. When you attain realization, it must be true realization. You
yourself must have the face of the great Bodhidharma to see him. Just
one such glimpse will be enough. But if you say you met him, you never
saw him at all.

*One should not discuss a dream  
In front of a simpleton.  
Why has Bodhidharma no beard?  
What an absurd question!*
