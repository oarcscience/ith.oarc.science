<p></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">7. Joshu Washes the Bowl</h3>  
<p>A monk told Joshu: "I have just entered the monastery. Please teach me."</p>  
<p>Joshu asked: "Have you eaten your rice porridge?"</p>  
<p>The monk replied: "I have eaten."</p>  
<p>Joshu said: "Then you had better wash your bowl."</p>  
<p>At that moment the monk was enlightened.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Joshu is the man who opens his mouth and shows his heart. I doubt if this monk really saw Joshu's heart. I hope he did not mistake the bell for a pitcher.</p>
