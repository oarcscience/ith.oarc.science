### 30. This Mind Is Buddha

Daibai asked Baso: "What is Buddha?"

Baso said: "This mind is Buddha."

 

*Mumon's comment:* If anyone wholly understands this, he is wearing
Buddha's clothing, he is eating Buddha's food, he is speaking Buddha's
words, he is behaving as Buddha, he is Buddha. This anecdote, however,
has given many a pupil the sickness of formality. If one truly
understands, he will wash out his mouth for three days after saying the
word Buddha, and he will close his ears and flee after hearing "This
mind is Buddha."

*Under blue sky, in bright sunlight,  
One need not search around.  
Asking what Buddha is  
Is like hiding loot in one's pocket and declaring oneself innocent*.
