### 15. Tozan's Three Blows

Tozan went to Ummon. Ummon asked him where he had come from.

Tozan said: "From Sato village."

Ummon asked: "In what temple did you remain for the summer?"

Tozan replied: "The temple of Hoji, south of the lake."

"When did you leave there?" asked Ummon, wondering how long Tozan would
continue with such factual answers.

"The twenty-fifth of August," answered Tozan.

Ummon said: "I should give you three blows with a stick, but today I
forgive you."

The next day Tozan bowed to Ummon and asked: "Yesterday you forgave me
three blows. I do not know why you thought me wrong."

Ummon, rebuking Tozan's spiritless responses, said: "You are good for
nothing. You simply wander from one monastery to another."

Before Ummon's words were ended Tozan was enlightened.

 

*Mumon's comment:* Ummon fed Tozan good Zen food. If Tozan can digest
it, Ummon may add another member to his family.

In the evening Tozan swam around in a sea of good and bad, but at dawn
Ummon crushed his nut shell. After all, he wasn't so smart.

Now, I want to ask: Did Tozan deserve the three blows? If you say yes,
not only Tozan but every one of you deserves them. If you say no, Ummon
is speaking a lie. If you answer this question clearly, you can eat the
same food as Tozan.

*The lioness teaches her cubs roughly;  
The cubs jump and she knocks them down.  
When Ummon saw Tozan his first arrow was light;  
His second arrow shot deep*.
