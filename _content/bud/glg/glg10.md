### 10. Seizei Alone and Poor

A monk named Seizei asked of Sozan: "Seizei is alone and poor. Will you
give him support?"

Sozan asked: "Seizei?"

Seizei responded: "Yes, sir."

Sozan said: "You have Zen, the best wine in China, and already have
finished three cups, and still you are saying that they did not even wet
your lips."

 

*Mumon's comment:* Seizei overplayed his hand. Why was it so? Because
Sozan had eyes and knew with whom to deal. Even so, I want to ask: At
what point did Seizei drink wine?

*The poorest man in China,  
The bravest man in China,  
He barely sustains himself,  
Yet wishes to rival the wealthiest*.
