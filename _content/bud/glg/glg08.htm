<p>Getsuan said to his students: "Keichu, the first wheel-maker of China, made two wheels of fifty spokes each. Now, suppose you removed the nave uniting the spokes. What would become of the wheel? And had Keichu done this, could he be called the master wheel-maker?"</p>

<p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> If anyone can answer this question instantly, his eyes will be like a comet and his mind like a flash of lightning.</p>
