<p>Zuigan called out to himself every day: "Master."</p>  
<p>Then he answered himself: "Yes, sir."</p>  
<p>And after that he added: "Become sober."</p>  
<p>Again he answered: "Yes, sir."</p>  
<p>"And after that," he continued, "do not be deceived by others."</p>  
<p>"Yes, sir; yes, sir," he answered.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Old Zuigan sells out and buys himself. He is opening a puppet show. He uses one mask to call "Master" and another that answers the master. Another mask says "Sober up" and another, "Do not be cheated by others." If anyone clings to any of his masks, he is mistaken,  yet if he imitates Zuigan, he will make himself fox-like.</p>
