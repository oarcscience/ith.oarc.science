### 43. Shuzan's Short Staff

Shuzan held out his short staff and said: "If you call this a short
staff, you oppose its reality. If you do not call it a short staff, you
ignore the fact. Now what do you wish to call this?"

 

*Mumon's comment:* If you call this a short staff, you oppose its
reality. If you do not call it a short staff, you ignore the fact. It
cannot be expressed with words and it cannot be expressed without words.
Now say quickly what it is.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Holding out the short staff,  
He gave an order of life or death.  
Positive and negative interwoven,  
Even Buddhas and patriarchs cannot escape this attack*.
