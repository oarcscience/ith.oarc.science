<p></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">10. Seizei Alone and Poor</h3>  
<p>A monk named Seizei asked of Sozan: "Seizei is alone and poor. Will you give him support?"</p>  
<p>Sozan asked: "Seizei?"</p>  
<p>Seizei responded: "Yes, sir."</p>  
<p>Sozan said: "You have Zen, the best wine in China, and already have finished three cups, and still you are saying that they did not even wet your lips."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>Mumon's comment:</i> Seizei overplayed his hand. Why was it so? Because Sozan had eyes and knew with whom to deal. Even so, I want to ask: At what point did Seizei drink wine?</p>
