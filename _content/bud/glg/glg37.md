### 37. A Buffalo Passes Through the Enclosure

Goso said: "When a buffalo goes out of his enclosure to the edge of the
abyss, his horns and his head and his hoofs all pass through, but why
can't the tail also pass?"

 

*Mumon's comment:* If anyone can open one eye at this point and say a
word of Zen, he is qualified to repay the four gratifications, and, not
only that, he can save all sentient beings under him. But if he cannot
say such a word of true Zen, he should turn back to his tail.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*If the buffalo runs, he will fall into the trench;  
If he returns, he will be butchered.  
That little tail  
Is a very strange thing*.
