### 40. Tipping Over a Water Vase

Hyakujo wished to send a monk to open a new monastery. He told his
pupils that whoever answered a question most ably would be appointed.
Placing a water vase on the ground, he asked: "Who can say what this is
without calling its name?"

The chief monk said: "No one can call it a wooden shoe."

Isan, the cooking monk, tipped over the vase with his foot and went out.

Hyakujo smiled and said: "The chief monk loses." And Isan became the
master of the new monastery.

 

*Mumon's comment:* Isan was brave enough, but he could not escape
Hyakujo's trick. After all, he gave up a light job and took a heavy one.
Why, can't you see, he took off his comfortable hat and placed himself
in iron stocks.

*Giving up cooking utensils,  
Defeating the chatterbox,  
Though his teacher sets a barrier for him  
His feet will tip over everything, even the Buddha*.
