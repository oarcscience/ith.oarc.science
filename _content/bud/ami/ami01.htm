<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps; font-size: 110%">Soon</span> after the time of A&ccedil;oka, the great Buddhist emperor of the third century before Christ, India became the theater of protracted invasions and wars. Vigorous tribes from the North conquered the region of the upper Pan jab and founded several states, among which the Kingdom of Gandh&acirc;ra became most powerful. Despoliations, epidemics, and famines visited the valley of the Ganges, but all these tribulations passed over the religious institutions without doing them any harm. Kings lost their crowns and the wealthy their riches, but the monks chanted their hymns in the selfsame way. Thus the storm breaks down mighty trees, but only bends the yielding reed.</p>  
<p>By the virtues, especially the equanimity and thoughtfulness, of the Buddhist priests, the conquerors in their turn were spiritually</p>  
<p><a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="green">p. 2</font></A></p>  
<p>conquered by the conquered, and they embraced the religion of enlightenment. They recognised the four noble truths taught by the Tath&acirc;gata: (1) the prevalence of suffering which is always in evidence in this world; (2) the origin of suffering as rising from the desire of selfishness; (3) the possibility of emancipation from suffering by abandoning all selfish clinging; and (4) the way of salvation from evil by walking in the noble eightfold path of moral conduct, consisting in right comprehension, right aspiration, right speech, right conduct, right living, right endeavor, right discipline, and the attainment of the right bliss.</p>  
<p>When the kingdom of Gandh&acirc;ra had been firmly established, commerce and trade began to thrive more than ever, while the vih&acirc;ras, or Buddhist monasteries, continued to be the home of religious exercises, offering an asylum to those who sought retirement from the turmoil of the world for the sake of finding peace of soul.</p>  
<p>It was in one of these vih&acirc;ras in the mountains near Purushaputra, the present Peshawur, that Charaka, a descendant of the Northern</p>  
<p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="green">p. 3</font></A></p>  
<p>invaders, had decided to join the brotherhood.<A HREF="ami16.htm#an_2">2</A> He was as yet little acquainted with the spirit and purpose of the institution; but being very serious and devoutly religious, the youth had decided, for the sake of attaining perfect enlightenment, to give up everything dear to him, his parents, his home, his brilliant prospect of a promising future, and the love that was secretly budding in his heart.</p>  
<p>The vih&acirc;ra which Charaka entered was excavated in the solid rock of an idyllic gorge. A streamlet gurgled by, affording to the hermits abundance of fresh water, and the monks could easily sustain their lives by the gifts of the villagers who lived near by, to which they added the harvest of fruit and vegetables which grew near their cave dwellings. In the midst of their small cells was a large chaitya, a hall or church, in which they assembled for daily services, for sermons, meditations, and other pious exercises.</p>  
<p>The chaitya, like the cells, was hewn out of the living rock; a row of massive columns on either side divided the hall into a central nave and two aisles.</p>  
<p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="green">p. 4</font></A></p>  
<p>The ornaments that covered the faces of the rocky walls, though the product of home talent, being made by the untrained hands of monk artists, did not lack a certain refinement and loftiness. The pictures exhibited scenes from the life of Buddha, his birth, his deeds, his miracles, illustrations of his parables, his sermons, and his final entry into Nirv&acirc;na.</p>  
<p>A procession of monks, preceded by a leader who swung a censer, filed in through the large portal of the chaitya. Two by two they moved along the aisles and solemnly circumambulated the dagoba, standing at the end of the nave in the apse of the hall, just in the place where idol worshipers would erect an altar to their gods It was in imitation of a tumulus destined to receive some relic of the revered teacher, and the genius of the architect had artfully designed the construction of the cave so that the rays of the sun fell upon the dagoba and surrounded its mysterious presence with a halo of light.</p>  
<p>The monks intoned a solemn chant, and its long-drawn cadences filled the hall with a spirit of sanctity, impressing the hearers as though Buddha himself had descended on its notes</p>  
<p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></A></p>  
<p>from his blissful rest in Nirv&acirc;na to instruct, to convert, and to gladden his faithful disciples.</p>  
<p>The monks chanted a hymn, of which the novice could catch some of the lines as they were sung; and these were the words that rang in his ears:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">"In the mountain hall we are taking our seats,<br> &nbsp;In solitude calming the mind;<br> &nbsp;Still are our souls, and in silence prepared<br> &nbsp;By degrees the truth to find."</div></p>  
<p>When they had circumambulated the dagoba, they halted in front of it where the novice now discovered an image of the Buddha in the attitude of teaching, and the monks spoke in chorus:</p>  
<p>"I am anxious to lead a life of purity to the end of my earthly career when my life will return to the precious trinity of the Buddha, the Truth and the Brotherhood."</p>  
<p>Then the chanting began again:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">"Vast as the sea<br> &nbsp;Our heart shall be,<br> &nbsp;And full of compassion and love.<br> &nbsp;Our thoughts shall soar <a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A><br> &nbsp;Forevermore<br> &nbsp;High. like the mountain dove.</p>  
<p>"We anxiously yearn<br> &nbsp;From the Master to learn,<br> &nbsp;Who found the path of salvation.<br> &nbsp;We follow His lead<br> &nbsp;Who taught us to read<br> &nbsp;The problem of origination.<A HREF="ami16.htm#an_3">3</A>"</div></p>  
<p>A venerable old monk who performed the duties of abbot now stepped forth and asked the assembled brethren whether any one had a communication to make that deserved the attention of the assemblage, and after the question had been repeated three times Subh&ucirc;ti, one of the older monks, said:</p>  
<p>"There is a young man with us who, having left the world, stayed with me some time for the sake of instruction and discipline. He is here and desires to be admitted to the brotherhood."</p>  
<p>The abbot replied: "Let him come forward."</p>  
<p>It was Charaka; and when he stepped into the midst of the brethren, the abbot viewed his tall figure with a kindly, searching glance and</p>  
<p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></A></p>  
<p>asked: "What is your name and what your desire?"</p>  
<p>Charaka knelt down and said with clasped hands: "My name is Charaka. I entreat the Brotherhood for initiation. May the Brotherhood receive me and raise me up to their height of spiritual perfection. Have compassion on me, reverend sirs, and grant my request."</p>  
<p>The abbot then asked the supplicant a series of questions as prescribed in the regulations of the brotherhood: whether he was free from contagious disease, whether he was a human being, a man, and of age, whether his own master and not a slave nor in the king's service; whether unencumbered with debts and whose disciple he was.</p>  
<p>When all the questions had been answered satisfactorily, the abbot submitted the case to the brotherhood, saying: "Reverend sirs, the Brotherhood may hear me. This man Charaka, a disciple of the venerable Subh&ucirc;ti, desires to receive the ordination. He is free from all obstacles to ordination. He has an alms-bowl and a yellow robe, and entreats the</p>  
<p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Brotherhood for ordination, with the reverent brother Subh&ucirc;ti as his teacher. Let those among the venerable brethren who are in favor of granting the ordination be silent. Let those who are opposed to it step forth and speak."</p>  
<p>These words were three times repeated, and as there was no dissenting voice, the abbot declared with solemnity: "The Brotherhood indicates by its silence that it grants to Charaka the ordination, with the reverend brother Subh&ucirc;ti as his teacher."</p>  
<p>Having completed the ceremony and having recited the rules of the order including the four great prohibitions, viz., that an ordained monk must abstain from carnal indulgence, from theft of any kind, from killing even the meanest creature, and from boasts of miraculous powers, the abbot requested the novice to pronounce the refuge formula, which Charaka repeated three times in a clear and ringing voice. Then the congregation again intoned a chant, and, having circumambulated the dagoba, left the assembly hall, marching in solemn procession along the aisles, each brother thereupon betaking himself to his cell.</p>
