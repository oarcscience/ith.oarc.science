<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps; font-size: 110%">Charaka</span> found by degrees and not without difficulties his mental equilibrium, which his friend Kanishka seemed to possess naturally. He unburdened his heart to the saintly old man and arrived at the conviction that he was not made for a monk and that his duties of life according to his disposition lay in other fields.</p>  
<p>In the meantime King Kanishka had sent a messenger to Matura his chancellor and vicegerent at Gandh&acirc;ra, to bring Princess Kamalavat&icirc; to Benares.</p>  
<p>Princess Kamalavat&icirc; arrived, and when her betrothal to Charaka was announced the happy events of our story reached their climax. A&ccedil;vaghosha solemnised the nuptials of both couples, Kanishka with Bhadra&ccedil;r&icirc;, and Charaka with Kamalavat&icirc;; and he read to them from the Dhammapada the famous stanza:</p>  
<p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></A></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;"><div style="font-size: 90%">"Sweet in the world is fatherhood,<br> &nbsp;And motherhood is sweet;<br> &nbsp;But sweeter is the thought of good,<br> &nbsp;If nobly our heart beat.</p>  
<p>"Sweeter, a life to old age spent<br> &nbsp;In truth and purity;<br> &nbsp;Sweeter, to reach enlightenment<br> &nbsp;And keep from evil free."<A HREF="ami16.htm#an_25">25</A></div></div></p>  
<p>When the marriage ceremony was over a feast was spread at the royal palace, and King Kanishka declared that he had a great respect for priests, but did not favor the idea that his friend, the physician royal, should resign his calling of wizard (as he was wont to call him) for the sake of becoming a monk. While there were plenty of good and honest men to wear the yellow robe, there was scarcely one man among a million who could perform miracles and save human lives, as Charaka had done.</p>  
<p>Charaka denied that he was a wizard. His art was no magic but consisted simply in observation and experiment, and it was nature whose forces he had learned to guide; but for all that he accomplished things which astounded</p>  
<p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></A></p>  
<p>the world. They were better than the miracles of magicians, for they were more useful and of enduring benefit to mankind.</p>  
<p>When his friends praised him, he replied: "My science is a beginning only and what I accomplish is the work of a tyro. The Tath&acirc;gata has preached the religion of enlightenment, he set the wheel rolling; it is now our duty to follow up his thought, to spread enlightenment, and to increase it. Amit&acirc;bha is infinite, and thus the possibilities of invention are inexhaustible. The wondrous things which man is able to do, and which he will do in the ages to come, can at present only be surmised by the wisest sages.</p>  
<p>"But greater than the greatest feats of invention will be the application of the Lord Buddha's maxim of loving-kindness in all fields of human intercourse, in family life, in politics, in labor and social affairs, in our dealings with friends and foes, with animals, and even with the degenerate and criminal. The enlightenment of our souls is most important. Therefore we praise the Tath&acirc;gata above all other things.</p>
