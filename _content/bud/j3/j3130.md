*"Wherever fruitful trees," etc.*—This story the Master dwelling at
Jetavana told concerning a certain Brother. The story goes that he lived
in a forest near a border village in the Kosala country, and received
instruction in forms of meditation from the Master. The people made him
a dwelling-place on a site where men continually passed to and fro,
providing him with day and night quarters, and attentively ministered to
him. In the very first month after he had entered upon the rainy season
the village was burned down and the people had not so much as a seed
left and were unable to supply his alms-bowl with savoury food; and
though he was in a pleasant place of abode, he was so distressed for
alms that he could not enter upon the Path or its Fruition. So when at
the end of three months he went to visit the Master, after words of
kindly greeting the Master hoped that though distressed for alms he had
a pleasant place to live in. The Brother told him how matters stood. The
Master on hearing that he had pleasant quarters said, "Brother, if this
is so, an ascetic ought to lay aside covetous ways, and be content to
eat whatever food he can get, and to fulfil all the duties of a priest.
Sages of old when born into the world as animals, \[491\] though they
lived on the powdered dust of the decayed

tree in which they had their abode, laid aside greedy desires and were
contented to stay where they were, and fulfilled the law of love. Why
then do you abandon a pleasant dwelling-place, because the food you
receive is scanty and coarse?" And at his request the Master told a
story of the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time many myriads of parrots lived in the Himālaya country
on the banks of the Ganges in a grove of fig-trees. A king of the
parrots there, when the fruit of the tree in which he dwelt had come to
an end, ate whatever was left, whether shoot or leaf or bark or rind,
and drank of water from the Ganges, and being very happy and contented
he kept where he was. Owing to his happy and contented state the abode
of Sakka was shaken. Sakka reflecting on the cause saw the parrot, and
to test his virtue, by his supernatural power he withered up the tree,
which became a mere stump perforated with holes, and stood to be
buffeted by every blast of wind, and from the holes dust came out. The
parrot king ate this dust and drank the water of the Ganges, and going
nowhere else sat perched on the top of the fig-stump, reeking nought of
wind and sun.

Sakka noticed how very contented the parrot was, and said, "After
hearing him speak of the virtue of friendship, I will come and give him
his choice of a boon, and cause the fig-tree to bear ambrosial fruit."
So he took the form of a royal goose, and preceded by Sujā in the shape
of an Asura nymph, he went to the grove of fig-trees, and perching on
the bough of a tree close by, he entered into conversation with the
parrot and spoke the first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Wherever fruitful trees abound,  
A flock of hungry birds is found:  
But should the trees all withered be,  
Away at once the birds will flee.

</div>

\[492\] And after these words, to drive the parrot thence, he spoke the
second stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Haste thee, Sir Redbeak, to be gone;  
Why dost thou sit and dream alone?  
Come tell me, prithee, bird of spring,  
To this dead stump why dost thou cling?

</div>

Then the parrot said, "O goose, from a feeling of gratitude, I forsake
not this tree," and he repeated two stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

They who have been close friends from youth,  
Mindful of goodness and of truth,  
In life and death, in weal and woe  
The claims of friendship ne’er forego.

I too would fain be kind and good  
To one that long my friend has stood;  
I wish to live, but have no heart  
From this old tree, though dead, to part.

</div>

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

Sakka on hearing what he said was delighted, and praising him wished to
offer him a choice, and uttered two stanzas:

\[493\] <span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I know thy friendship and thy grateful love,  
Virtues that wise men surely must approve.

I offer thee whate’er thou wilt for choice;  
Parrot, what boon would most thy heart rejoice?

</div>

On hearing this, the king parrot making his choice spoke the seventh
stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If thou, O goose, what most I crave wouldst give,  
Grant that the tree I love, again may live.  
Let it once more with its old vigour shoot,  
Gather fresh sweetness and bear goodly fruit.

</div>

Then Sakka, granting the boon, spoke the eighth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lo! friend, a fruitful and right noble tree,  
Well fitted for thy dwelling-place to be.  
Let it once more with its old vigour shoot,  
Gather fresh sweetness and bear goodly fruit.

</div>

\[494\] With these words Sakka quitted his present form, and manifesting
the supernatural power of himself and Sujā, he took up water from the
Ganges in his hand and dashed it against the fig-tree stump. Straightway
the tree rose up rich in branch, and stem, and with honey-sweet fruit,
and stood a charming sight, like unto the bare Jewel-Mount. The parrot
king on seeing it was highly pleased, and singing the praises of Sakka
he spoke the ninth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

May Sakka and all loved by Sakka blesséd be,  
As I to-day am blest this goodly sight to see!

</div>

Sakka, after granting the parrot his choice, and causing the fig-tree to
bear ambrosial fruit, returned with Sujātā to his own abode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In illustration of this story these stanzas inspired by Perfect Wisdom
were added at the close:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Soon as king parrot wisely made his choice,  
    The tree once more put forth its fruit again;  
    Then Sakka with his queen did fly amain  
To where in Nandana the gods rejoice.

</div>

The Master, his lesson ended, said, "Thus, Brother, sages of old though
born in animal forms were free from covetousness. Why then do you, after
being ordained under so excellent a dispensation, follow greedy ways? So
and dwell in the same place." And he gave him a form of meditation, and
thus identified the Birth:—The Brother went back and by spiritual
insight attained to Sainthood:—"At that time Sakka was Anuruddha, and
the parrot king was myself."
