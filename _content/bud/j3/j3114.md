*"The righteous king," etc.*—The Master told this tale while dwelling in
Jetavana, concerning the Kosala king's favour to a stranger. At one
time, the story goes, that king showed no favour to his old warriors who
came to him in the usual way, but gave honour and hospitality to
strangers coming for the first time. He went to fight in a disturbed
frontier province: but his old warriors would not fight, thinking that
the new-corners who were in favour would do so; and the new-corners
would not, thinking that the old warriors would. The rebels prevailed.
The king, knowing that his defeat was owing to the mistake he had made
in showing favour to new-comers, returned to Sāvatthi. He resolved to
ask the Lord of Wisdom whether he was the only king who had ever been
defeated for that reason: so after the morning meal he went to Jetavana
and put the question to the Master. The Master answered, "Great King,
yours is not the only case: former kings also were defeated by reason of
the favour they showed to new-corners," and so, at the king's request,
he told an old tale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time in the city of Indapattana, in the kingdom of the
Kurus, a king was reigning named Dhanañjaya, of the race of Yudhiṭṭhila.
The Bodhisatta was born in the house of his family priest. When he grew
up, he learned all the arts at Takkasilā. He returned to Indapattana,
and at his father's death he became family priest to the king and his
counsellor in things temporal and spiritual. His name was called
Vidhūrapaṇḍita.

King Dhanañjaya disregarded his old soldiers and showed favour to
new-comers. He went to fight in a disturbed frontier province: but
neither his old warriors nor the new-comers would fight, each thinking
the other party would see to the matter. The king was defeated. On his
return to Indapattana he reflected that his defeat was due to the favour
he had shown to new-comers. \[401\] One day he thought, "Am I the only
king who has ever been defeated through favour shown to new-corners, or
have others had the same fate before? I will ask Vidhūrapaṇḍita." So he
put the question to Vidhūrapaṇḍita when he came to the king's levee.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, declaring the reason of his question, spoke half a stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The righteous king Yudhiṭṭhila once asked Vidhūra wise,  
"Brahmin, dost know in whose lone heart much bitter sorrow lies?"

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hearing him, the Bodhisatta said, "Great king, your sorrow is but a
trifling sorrow. Of old, a brahmin goatherd, named Dhūmakāri, took a
great flock of goats, and making a pen in the forest kept them there: he
had a smoking fire and lived on milk and the like, tending his goats.
Seeing some deer of golden hue who had come, he felt a love for them,
and disregarding his goats he paid the honour due to them to the deer.
In the autumn the deer moved away to the Himālaya: his goats were dead
and the deer gone from his sight: so for sorrow he took jaundice and
died. He paid honour to new-comers and perished, having sorrow and
misery a hundred, a thousand times more than you." Bringing forward this
instance, he said,

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A brahmin with a flock of goats, of high Vasiṭṭha's race,  
Kept smoking fire by night and day in forest dwelling-place.

Smelling the smoke, a herd of deer, by gnats sore pestered, come  
To find a dwelling for the rains near Dhūmakāri's home.

The deer have all attention now; his goats receive no care,  
They come and go untended all, and so they perish there.

\[402\] But now the gnats have left the wood, the autumn's clear of
rain:  
The deer must seek the mountain-heights and river-springs again.

The brahmin sees the deer are gone and all his goats are dead:  
Jaundice attacks him worn with grief, and all his colour's fled.

So he who disregards his own, and calls a stranger dear,  
Like Dhūmakāri, mourns alone with many a bitter tear.

</div>

Such was the tale told by the Great Being to console the king. The king
was comforted and pleased, and gave him much wealth. From that time
onward he showed favour to his own people, and doing deeds of charity
and virtue, he became destined for heaven.

After the lesson, the Master identified the Birth: "At that time the
Kuru king was Ānanda, Dhūmakāri was Pasenadi, king of Kosala, and
Vidhūrapaṇḍita was myself."
