#### SUJĀTA-JĀTAKA.

*"Why haste to bring," etc.*—This story the Master, while dwelling at
Jetavana, told concerning a landowner who had lost his father. On the
death of his father, they say, he went about lamenting, quite unable to
shake off his grief. The Master perceived in the man a capacity to
attain to the Fruit of Salvation, and when he went his rounds in
Sāvatthi for alms, accompanied by an attendant priest, he came to his
house and sitting down on the seat prepared for him he bowed to his
host, who was also seated, and said, "Lay Brother, art thou grieving?"
and on his replying, "Yes, Reverend Sir, I am," he said, "Friend, sages
of old hearkened to the words of Wisdom, and when they lost a father,
they did not grieve." And at the request of his host he told a story of
the olden time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta came to life in the house of a landowner. And they called him
young Sujāta. When he was grown up, his grandsire died. Then his father
from the day of the old man's death was filled with sorrow, and taking
his bones from the place of cremation he erected an earth-mound in his
pleasure-garden, and depositing the remains there, whenever he visited

the place, adorned the tope with flowers and studiously lamented,
neither bathing nor anointing himself nor eating. Neither did he attend
to his business. The Bodhisatta, on observing this, thought, "My father
ever since the death of my grandfather goes about overwhelmed with
grief. And no one, I am sure, except myself has power to console him. I
will find a way to deliver him from his sorrow."

\[156\] So seeing a dead ox lying outside the city, he brought grass and
water and placing them before it said, "Eat and drink, eat and drink."
All that passed by on seeing this said, "Friend Sujāta, are you mad? Do
you offer grass and water to a dead ox?" But he answered not a word.

So they went to his father and said, "Your son has become mad. He is
giving grass and water to a dead ox." On hearing this the landowner
ceased to grieve for his father, and began to grieve for his son. And he
went in haste and cried, "My dear Sujāta, are you not in your sober
senses? Why do you offer grass and water to the carcase of an ox?" And
hereupon he spoke two stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Why haste to bring thy new-mown grass so sweet,  
And cry to lifeless beast, "Arise and eat”?

No food may raise to life an ox that's dead,  
Thy words are idle and of folly bred.

</div>

Then the Bodhisatta uttered two stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Methinks this beast may come to life again,  
Both head and tail and its four feet remain.

But of my grandsire head and limbs are gone:  
No fool weeps o’er his grave, but thou alone.

</div>

\[157\] On hearing this the father of the Bodhisatta thought: "My son is
wise. He knows the right thing to be done both for this world and for
the next. He did this to console me." And he said, "My dear and wise son
Sujāta, it is known to me that all existing things are impermanent.
Henceforth I will not grieve. Such a son as this must be every one that
would remove a father's grief." And singing the praises of his son he
said .—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As ghee-fed flame that blazes out amain  
Is quenched with water, so he quenched my pain.  
With sorrow's shaft my heart was wounded sore,  
He healed the wound and did my life restore.  
The barb extracted, full of peace and joy,  
I cease to grieve and hearken to my boy.  
Thus kindly souls wean mortals from their grief,  
As wise Sujāta brought his sire relief.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master having ended his discourse revealed the Truths and identified
the Birth:—At the conclusion of the Truths the landowner attained
fruition of the First Path:—"At that time I myself was Sujāta."
