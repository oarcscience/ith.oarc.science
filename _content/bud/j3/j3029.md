*"Why should I shed tears," etc.*—This story was told by the Master
while living at Jetavana, of a certain landowner who had lost his wife.
On her death, they say, he neither washed himself nor took food, and
neglected his farm duties. Overcome with grief he would wander about the
cemetery lamenting, while his predestination to enter the First Path
blazed forth like a halo about his head. The Master, early one morning,
casting his eye upon the world and beholding him said, "Save me there is
no one that can remove this man's sorrow and bestow upon him the power
of entering the First Path. I will be his refuge." So when he had
returned from his rounds and had eaten his meal, he took an attendant
priest and went to the door of the landowner's house. \[93\] And he on
hearing that the Master was coming went out to meet him, and with other
marks of respect seated him in the prescribed seat and came and sitting
on one side saluted him.

The Master asked, "Wherefore, lay brother, are you silent?"

"Reverend Sir," he replied, "I am grieving for her."

The Master said, "Lay brother, that which is breakable is broken, but
when this happens, one ought not to grieve. Sages of old, when they lost
a wife, knew this truth, and therefore sorrowed not." And then at his
request the Master told an old-world tale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The old legend will be found set forth in the Cullabodhi Birth <span
id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40) in the Tenth Book. Here follows a short
summary of it.

Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the
Bodhisatta was born into a brahmin family. And when he grew up, he
studied all the arts at Takkasilā and then returned to his parents. In
this Birth the Great Being became a holy young student. Then his parents
told him they would look out a wife for him.

"I have no desire for a married life," said the Bodhisatta. "When you
are dead, I will adopt the religious life of an ascetic."

And being greatly importuned by them, he had a golden image <span
id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41) made,

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

and said, "If you can find me a maiden like unto this, I will take her
to wife." His parents sent forth some emissaries with a large escort,
and bade them place the golden image in a covered carriage and go and
search through the plains of India, till they found just such a young
brahmin girl, when they were to give this golden image in exchange, and
bring the girl back with them. Now at this time a certain holy man
passing from the Brahma world was born again in the form of a young girl
in a town in the kingdom of Kāsi, in the house of a brahmin worth eighty
crores, and the name given her was Sammillabhāsinī. At the age of
sixteen she was a fair and gracious maiden, like to an Apsara, endued
with all the marks of female beauty. And since no thought of evil was
ever suggested to her by the power of sinful passion, she was perfectly
pure. \[94\] So the men took the golden image and wandered about till
they reached this village. The inhabitants on seeing the image asked,
"Why is Sammillabhāsinī, the daughter of such and such a brahmin, placed
there?" The messengers on hearing this found the brahmin family, and
chose Sammillabhāsinī for the prince's bride. She sent a message to her
parents, saying, "When you are dead, I shall adopt the religious life; I
have no desire for the married state." They said, "What art thou
thinking of, maiden?" And accepting the golden image they sent off their
daughter with a great retinue. The marriage ceremony took place against
the wishes of both the Bodhisatta and Sammillabhāsinī. Though sharing
the same room and the same bed they did not regard one another with the
eye of sinful passion, but dwelt together like two holy men or two
female saints.

By and bye the father and mother of the Bodhisatta died. He performed
their funeral rites and calling to him Sammillabhāsinī, said to her, "My
dear, my family property amounts to eighty crores, and yours too is
worth another eighty crores. Take all this and enter upon household
life. I shall become an ascetic."

"Sir," she answered, "if you become an ascetic, I will become one too. I
cannot forsake you."

"Come then," he said. So spending all their wealth in almsgiving and
throwing up their worldly fortune as it were a lump of phlegm, they
journeyed into the Himālaya country and both of them adopted the ascetic
life. There after living for a long time on wild fruits and roots, they
at length came down from the Himālayas to procure salt and vinegar, and
gradually found their way to Benares, and dwelt in the royal grounds.
And while they were living there, this young and delicate female
ascetic, from eating insipid rice of a mixed quality, was attacked by
dysentery and not being able to get any healing remedies, she grew very
weak. The Bodhisatta at the time for going his rounds to beg for alms,
took hold of her and carried her to the gate of the city and there laid
her on a bench in a certain hall, and himself went into the city for
alms. He had scarce

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

gone out when she expired. The people, beholding the great beauty of
this female ascetic, \[95\] thronged about her, weeping and lamenting.
The Bodhisatta after going his round of begging returned, and hearing of
her death he said, "That which has the quality of dissolution is
dissolved. All impermanent existences are of this kind." With these
words he sat down on the bench whereon she lay and eating the mixture of
food he rinsed out his mouth. The people that stood by gathered round
him and said, "Reverend Sir, what was this female ascetic to you?"

"When I was a layman," he replied, "she was my wife."

"Holy Sir," they said, "while we weep and lament and cannot control our
feelings, why do you not weep?"

The Bodhisatta said, "While she was alive, she belonged to me in some
sort. Nothing belongs to her that is gone to another world.: she has
passed into the power of others. Wherefore should I weep?" And teaching
the people the Truth, he recited these stanzas:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Why should I shed tears for thee,  
Fair Sammillabhāsinī?  
Passed to death's majority <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42)  
Thou art henceforth lost to me.

Wherefore should frail man lament  
What to him is only lent?  
He too draws his mortal breath  
Forfeit every hour to death.

Be he standing, sitting still,  
Moving, resting, what he will,  
In the twinkling of an eye,  
In a moment death is nigh.

Life I count a thing unstable,  
Loss of friends inevitable.  
Cherish all that are alive,  
Sorrow not shouldst thou survive.

</div>

\[97\] Thus did the Great Being teach the Truth, illustrating by these
four stanzas the impermanence of things. The people performed funeral
rites over the female ascetic. And the Bodhisatta returned to the
Himālayas, and entering on the higher knowledge arising from mystic
meditation was destined to birth in the Brahma-world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Master, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified
the Birth:—At the conclusion of the Truths, the landowner attained to
fruition of the First Path:—"At that time the mother of Rāhula was
Sammillabhāsinī, and I myself was the ascetic."
