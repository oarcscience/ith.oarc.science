#### BAKA-BRAHMA-JĀTAKA. <span id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_133)

*"Seventy and two," etc.*—The Master told this tale while dwelling in
Jetavana, concerning the brahma <span id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_134)
Baka. In him a false doctrine arose, namely, "This present existence is
perpetual, permanent, eternal, unchanging: apart from it there is no
salvation or release at all." In a former birth this brahma had once

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

practised meditation, so he was born in the Vehapphala heaven. Having
spent there an existence of five hundred kalpas, he was born in the
Subhakiṇṇa heaven; after sixty-four kalpas there he passed and was born
in the Ābhassara heaven, where existence is for eight kalpas. It was
there that this false doctrine arose in him. He forgot that he had
passed from higher Brahmaloka heavens and had been born in that heaven,
and perceiving neither of these things had taken up the false doctrine.
The Lord, understanding his reflections, \[359\] as easily as a strong
man can extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm, disappearing from
Jetavana, appeared in that Brahmaloka. The brahma, seeing the Lord,
said, "Come hither, my lord; welcome, my lord; it is a long time, my
lord, since thou hast taken this opportunity, even for coming hither;
this world, my lord, is perpetual, it is permanent, it is eternal, it is
absolute, it is unchanging; this world is not born, it decays not, it
dies not, it passes not away, it is not born again: apart from this
world there is no other salvation beyond." When this was said, the Lord
said to Baka the brahma, "Baka the brahma has come to ignorance, he has
come to ignorance, when he will say that a thing which is not permanent
is permanent, and so on, and that there is no other salvation apart from
this when there is another salvation." Hearing this the brahma thought,
"This one presses me hard, finding out exactly what I say," and as a
timid thief, after receiving a few blows, says, "Am I the only thief? so
and so and so and so are thieves too," showing his associates; so he, in
fear of the Lord's questioning, showing that others were his associates,
spoke the first stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Seventy and two, O Gotama, are we  
Righteous and great, from birth and age we're free:  
Our heaven is wisdom's home, there's nought above:  
And many others will this view approve.

</div>

Hearing his words, the Master spoke the second stanza:—

\[360\] <span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Short your existence in this world: ’tis wrong,  
Baka, to think existence here is long:  
A hundred thousand aeons past and gone  
All your existence well to me is known.

</div>

Hearing this, Baka spoke the third stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Of wisdom infinite, O Lord, am I:  
Birth, age, and sorrow, all beneath me lie:  
What should I do with good works, long ago?  
Yet tell me something, Lord, that I should know.

</div>

Then the Lord, relating and showing him things of past time, spoke four
stanzas:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

To many a man of old thou gavest drink  
For thirst and parching drought ready to sink:  
That virtuous deed of thine so long ago  
Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know.

\[361\] By Eṇi's bank thou sett’st the people free  
When chained and held in close captivity:  
That virtuous deed of thine so long ago  
Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know.

By Ganges' stream the man thou didst set free,  
Whose boat was seized by nāga, cruelly  
Lusting for flesh, and save him mightily:  
That virtuous deed of thine, so long ago  
Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know.

</div>

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

And I was Kappa, thy disciple true,  
Thy wisdom and thy virtues all I knew:  
And now those deeds of thine so long ago  
Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know.

</div>

\[363\] Hearing his own deeds from the Master's discourse, Baka gave
thanks and spoke this last stanza:—

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thou knowest every life that hath been mine:  
Buddha thou art, all wisdom sure is thine:  
And sure thy glorious majesty and state  
Even this Brahma world illuminate.

</div>

So the Master, making known his quality as Buddha and expounding the
Law, shewed forth the Truths. At the end the thoughts of ten thousand
brahmas were freed from attachments and sins. So the Lord became the
refuge of many brahmas, and going back from Brahmaloka to Jetavana
preached the law in the way described and identified the Birth: "At that
time Baka the brahma was the ascetic Kesava, Kappa the disciple was
myself."
