*"Since thou hast gained," etc.*—This story was told by the Master
whilst living at Jetavana, about the temptation of a Brother by the wife
of his unregenerate days. When the Brother confessed that it was owing
to the wife

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

that he had left, that he regretted having taken orders, the Master
said, "Not now only, Brother, did this woman do you a mischief. Formerly
too it was owing to her that your head was cut off." And at the request
of the Brethren he related a story of the past.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time in the reign of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, the
Bodhisatta was reborn as Sakka. At that time a certain young brahmin of
Benares acquired all the liberal arts at Takkasilā, and having attained
to proficiency in archery, he was known as the clever Little Archer.
Then his master thought, "This youth has acquired skill equal to my
own," and he gave him his daughter to wife. He took her and wishing to
return to Benares he set out on the road. Half way on his journey, an
elephant laid waste a certain place, and no man dared to ascend to that
spot. The clever Little Archer, though the people tried to stop him,
\[220\] took his wife and climbed up to the entrance of the forest. Then
when he was in the midst of the wood, the elephant rose up to attack
him. The Archer wounded him in the forehead with an arrow, which
piercing him through and through came out at the back of his head, and
the elephant fell down dead on the spot. The clever Archer after making
this place secure, went on further to another wood. And there fifty
robbers were infesting the road. Up to this spot too, though men tried
to stop him, he climbed till he found the regular place, where the
robbers killed the deer and roasted and ate the venison, close to the
road. The robbers, seeing him approach with his gaily attired wife, made
a great effort to capture him. The robber chief, being skilled in
reading a man's character, just gave one look at him, and recognizing
him as a distinguished hero, did not suffer them to rise up against him,
though he was single-handed. The clever Archer sent his wife to these
robbers, saying, "Go and bid them give us a spit of meat, and bring it
to me." So she went and said, "Give me a spit of meat." The robber chief
said, "He is a noble fellow," and bade them give it her. The robbers
said, "What! is he to eat our roast meat?" And they gave her a piece of
raw meat. The Archer, having a good opinion of himself, was wroth with
the robbers for offering him raw meat. The robbers said, "What! is he
the only man, and are we merely women?" And thus threatening him, they
rose up against him. The Archer wounded and struck to the ground fifty
robbers save one with the same number of arrows. He had no arrow left to
wound the robber chief. There had been full fifty arrows in his quiver.
With one of them he had wounded the elephant, and with the rest the
fifty robbers save one. So he knocked down the robber chief, and sitting
on his chest bade his wife bring him his sword in her hand to cut off
his head. At that very moment she conceived a passion for the robber
chief \[221\] and placed the hilt of the

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

sword in his hand and the sheath in that of her husband. The robber
grasping the hilt drew out the sword, and cut off the head of the
Archer. After slaying her husband he took the woman with him, and as
they journeyed together he inquired of her origin. "I am the daughter,"
she said, "of a world-famed professor at Takkasilā."

"How did he get you for his wife?" he said.

"My father," she said, "was so pleased at his having acquired from him
an art equal to his own, that he gave me to him to wife. And because I
fell in love with you, I let you kill my lawful husband."

Thought the robber chief, "This woman now has killed her lawful husband.
As soon as she sees some other man, she will treat me too after the same
sort. I must get rid of her."

And as he went on his way, he saw their path cut off by what was usually
a poor little shallow stream, but which was now flooded, and he said,
"My dear, there is a savage crocodile in this river. What are we to do?"

"My lord," she said, "take all the ornaments I wear, and make them into
a bundle in your upper robe, and carry them to the further side of the
river, and then come back and take me across."

"Very well," he said, and took all her adornments, and going down to the
stream, like one in great haste, he gained the other bank, and left her
and fled.

On seeing this she cried, "My lord, you go as if you were leaving me.
Why do you do this? Come back and take me with you." And addressing him
she uttered the first stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Since thou hast gained the other side,  
With all my goods in bundle tied,  
Return as quickly as may be  
And carry me across with thee.

</div>

The robber, on hearing her, as he stood on the further bank, repeated
the second stanza: <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_88)

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thy fancy, lady, ever roves  
From well-tried faith to lighter loves,  
\[222\] Me too thou wouldst ere long betray,  
Should I not hence flee far away.

</div>

But when the robber said, "I will go further hence: you stop where you
are," she screamed aloud, and he fled with all her adornments. Such was
the fate that overtook the poor fool through excess of passion. And
being quite helpless she drew nigh to a clump of cassia plants and sat
there weeping. At that moment Sakka, looking down upon the world, saw
her smitten with desire and weeping for the loss of both husband and
lover.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And thinking he
would go and rebuke her and put her to shame, he took with him Mātali
and Pañcasikha <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_89), and went and stood
on the bank of the river and said, "Mātali, do you become a fish,
Pañcasikha, you change into a bird, and I will become a jackal. And
taking a piece of meat in my mouth, I will go and place myself in front
of this woman, and when you see me there, you, Mātali, are to leap up
out of the water, and fall before me, and when I shall drop the piece of
meat I have taken in my mouth, and shall spring up to seize the fish, at
that moment, you, Pañcasikha, are to pounce upon the piece of meat, and
to fly up into the air, and you, Mātali, are to fall into the water."

Thus did Sakka instruct them. And they said, "Good, my lord." Mātali was
changed into a fish, Pañcasikha into a bird, and Sakka became a jackal.
And taking a piece of meat in his mouth, he went and placed himself in
front of the woman. The fish leaping up out of the water fell before the
jackal. The jackal dropping the piece of meat he held in his mouth,
sprang up to catch the fish. The fish jumped up and fell into the water,
and the bird seized the piece of meat and flew up into the air. The
jackal thus lost both fish and meat and sat sulkily looking towards the
clump of cassia. The woman seeing this said, "Through being too
covetous, he got neither flesh nor fish," \[223\] and, as if she saw the
point of the trick, she laughed heartily.

The jackal, on hearing this, uttered the third stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Who makes the cassia thicket ring  
With laughter, though none dance or sing,  
Or clap their hands, good time to keep?  
Fair one, laugh not, when thou shouldst weep.

</div>

On hearing this, she repeated the fourth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O silly jackal, thou must wish  
Thou hadst not lost both flesh and fish.  
Poor fool! well mayst thou grieve to see  
What comes of thy stupidity.

</div>

Then the jackal repeated the fifth stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Another's faults are plainly seen,  
’Tis hard to see one's own, I ween.  
Methinks thou too must count the cost,  
When spouse and lover both are lost.

</div>

\[224\] On hearing his words she spoke this stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

King jackal, ’tis just as you say,  
So I will hie me far away,  
And seek another wedded love  
And strive a faithful wife to prove.

</div>

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

Then Sakka, king of heaven, hearing the words of this vicious and
unchaste woman, repeated the final stanza:

<span class="small"></span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He that would steal a pot of clay  
Would steal a brass one any day:  
So she who was her husband's bane  
Will be as bad or worse again.

</div>

Thus did Sakka put her to shame and brought her to repent, and then
returned to his own abode.

The Master here ended his lesson and revealed the Truths, and identified
the Birth:—At the conclusion of the Truths the backsliding Brother
attained the fruit of the First Path:—" At that time the backsliding
Brother was the Archer, the wife he had left was that woman, and I
myself was Sakka, king of heaven."
