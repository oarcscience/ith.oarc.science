# SECRECY AND PUBLICITY

THE Buddha said: "Three things, O disciples, are characterized by
secrecy: love affairs, priestly wisdom, and all aberrations from the
path of truth. Women who are in love, O disciples seek secrecy and shun
publicity; priests who claim to be in possession of special revelation,
O disciples, seek secrecy and shun publicity; all those who stray from
the path of truth, O disciples, seek secrecy and shun publicity.

"Three things, O disciples, shine before the world and cannot be hidden.
What are the three? The moon, O disciples, illumines the world and
cannot be hidden; the sun, O disciples, illumines the world and cannot
be hidden; and the truth proclaimed by the Tathagata illumines the world
and cannot be hidden. These three things, O disciples, illumine the
world and cannot be hidden. There is no secrecy about them."
