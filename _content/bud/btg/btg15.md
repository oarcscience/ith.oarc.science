# THE BRAHMA'S REQUEST

THE Blessed One having attained Buddhahood while resting under the
shepherd's Nigrodha tree on the banks of the river Neranjara, pronounced
this solemn utterance:

"How sure his pathway in this wood,  
Who follows truth's unchanging call!  
How blessed, to be kind and good,  
And practice self-restraint in all!  
How light, from passion to be free,  
And sensual joys to let go by!  
And yet his greatest bliss will be  
When he has quelled the pride of 'I'.

"I have recognized the deepest truth, which is sublime and peace-giving'
but difficult to understand; for most men move in a sphere of worldly
interests and find their delight in worldly desires. The worldling will
not understand the doctrine, for to him there is happiness in selfhood
only, and the bliss that lies in a complete surrender to truth is
unintelligible to him. He will call resignation what to the enlightened
mind is the purest joy. He will see annihilation where the perfected one
finds immortality. He will regard as death what the conqueror of self
knows to be life everlasting. The truth remains hidden from him who is
in the bondage of hate and desire. Nirvana remains incomprehensible and
mysterious to the vulgar whose minds are beclouded with worldly
interests. Should I preach the doctrine and mankind not comprehend it,
it would bring me only fatigue and trouble."

Mara, the Evil One, on hearing the words of the Blessed Buddha,
approached and said: "Be greeted, thou Holy One. Thou hast attained the
highest bliss and it is time for thee to enter into the final Nirvana."

Then Brahma Sahampati descended from the heavens and, having worshiped
the Blessed One, said: "Alas! the world must perish, should the Holy
One, the Tathagata, decide not to teach the Dharma. Be merciful to those
that struggle; have compassion upon the sufferers; pity the creatures
who are hopelessly entangled in the snares of sorrow. There are some
beings that are almost free from the dust of worldliness. If they hear
not the doctrine preached, they will be lost. But if they hear it, they
will believe and be saved."

The Blessed One, full of compassion, looked with the eye of a Buddha
upon all sentient creatures, and he saw among them beings whose minds
were but scarcely covered by the dust of worldliness, who were of good
disposition and easy to instruct. He saw some who were conscious of the
dangers of lust and wrong doing. And the Blessed One said to Brahma
Sahampati: "Wide open be the door of immortality to all who have ears to
hear. May they receive the Dharma with faith."

Then the Blessed One turned to Mara, saying: "I shall not pass into the
final Nirvana, O Evil One, until there be not only brethren and sisters
of an Order, but also lay disciples of both sexes, who shall have become
true hearers, wise, well trained, ready and learned, versed in the
scriptures, fulfilling all the greater and lesser duties, correct in
life, walking according to the precepts-until they, having thus
themselves learned the doctrine, shall be able to give information to
others concerning it, preach it, make it known, establish it, open it,
minutely explain it, and make it clear-until they, when others start
vain doctrines, shall be able to vanquish and refute them, and so to
spread the wonderworking truth abroad. I shall not die until the pure
religion of truth shall have become successful, prosperous, widespread,
and popular in all its full extent-until, in a word, it shall have been
well proclaimed among men!"

Then Brahma Sahampati understood that the Blessed One had granted his
request and would preach the doctrine.
