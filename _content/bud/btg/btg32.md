# SUDDHODANA ATTAINS NIRVANA

WHEN Suddhodana had grown old, he fell sick and sent for his son to come
and see him once more before he died; and the Blessed One came and
stayed at the sick-bed, and Suddhodana, having attained perfect
enlightenment, died in the arms of the Blessed One.

And it is said that the Blessed One, for the sake of preaching to his
mother Maya-devi, ascended to heaven and dwelt with the devas. Having
concluded his pious mission, he returned to the earth and went about
again, converting those who listened to his teachings.
