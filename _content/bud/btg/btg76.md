# THE OUTCAST

WHEN Bhagavat dwelt at Savatthi in the Jetavana, he went out with his
alms-bowl to beg for food and approached the house of a Brahman priest
while the fire of an offering was blazing upon the altar. And the priest
said: "Stay there, O shaveling; stay there, O wretched samana; thou art
an outcast."

The Blessed One replied: "Who is an outcast? An outcast is the man who
is angry and bears hatred; the man who is wicked and hypocritical, he
who embraces error and is full of deceit. Whosoever is a provoker and is
avaricious, has evil desires, is envious, wicked, shameless, and without
fear to commit wrong, let him be known as an outcast. Not by birth does
one become an outcast, not by birth does one become a Brahman; by deeds
one becomes an outcast, by deeds one becomes a Brahman."
