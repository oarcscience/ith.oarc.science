# SARIPUTTA AND MOGGALLANA

AT that time Sariputta and Moggallana, two Brahmans and chiefs of the
followers of Sanjaya, led a religious life. They had promised each
other: "He who first attains Nirvana shall tell the other one."

Sariputta seeing the venerable Assaji begging for alms, modestly keeping
his eyes to the ground and dignified in deportment, exclaimed: "Truly
this samana has entered the right path; I will ask him in whose name he
has retired from the world and what doctrine he professes." Being
addressed by Sariputta, Assaji replied: "I am a follower of the Buddha,
the Blessed One, but being a novice I can tell you the substance only of
the doctrine."

Said Sariputta: "Tell me, venerable monk; it is the substance I want."
And Assaji recited the stanza:

"Nothing we seek to touch or see  
Can represent Eternity.  
They spoil and die: then let us find  
Eternal Truth within the mind."

Having heard this stanza, Sariputta obtained the pure and spotless eye
of truth and said: "Now I see clearly, whatsoever is subject to
origination is also subject to cessation. If this be the doctrine I have
reached the state to enter Nirvana which heretofore has remained hidden
from me." Sariputta went to Moggallana and told him, and both said: "We
will go to the Blessed One, that he, the Blessed One, may be our
teacher."

When the Buddha saw Sariputta and Moggallana coming from afar, he said
to his disciples, These two monks are highly auspicious." When the two
friends had taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, the
Holy One said to his other disciples: "Sariputta, like the first-born O
son of a world-ruling monarch, is well able to assist the king as his
chief follower to set the wheel of the law rolling."

Now the people were annoyed. Seeing that many distinguished young men of
the kingdom of Magadha led a religious life under the direction of the
Blessed One, they became angry and murmured: "Gotama Sakyamuni induces
fathers to leave their wives and causes families to become extinct."
When they saw the bhikkhus, they reviled them, saying: "The great
Sakyamuni has come to Rajagaha subduing the minds of men. Who will be
the next to be led astray by him?"

The bhikkhus told it to the Blessed One, and the Blessed One said: "This
murmuring, O bhikkhus, will not last long. it will last seven days. If
they revile you, answer them with these words: 'It is by preaching the
truth that Tathagatas lead men. Who will murmur at the wise? Who will
blame the virtuous? Who will condemn self-control, righteousness, and
kindness?" And the Blessed One proclaimed:

"Commit no wrong, do only good,  
And let your heart be pure.  
This is the doctrine Buddhas teach,  
And this doctrine will endure."
