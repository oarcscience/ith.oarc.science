# I. GATHAS AND PRAYERS

Gatha is a Sanskrit term meaning "verse" or "hymn". In Buddhist
literature it is used to designate the versified portion of the sutras.
Chinese scholars have adopted this word for their Versified
compositions, which are known as *chieh*, an abbreviation of
*chieh-t'o*, or as *chieh-sang*, which is the combination of the
Sanskrit and the Chinese. The gathas collected here are not exclusively
those of the Zen sect; some belong to general Buddhism.

# GATHAS AND PRAYERS

## I

## ON OPENING THE SUTRA

The Dharma incomparably profound and exquisite  
Is rarely met with, even in hundreds of thousands of millions of
kalpas;  
We are now permitted to see it, to listen to it, to accept and hold
it;  
May we truly understand the meaning of the Tathagata's words!

## II

## CONFESSION

All the evil karma ever committed by me since of old,  
On account of greed, anger, and folly, which have no beginning,  
Born of my body, mouth, and thought--  
I now make full open confession of it.

## III

## THE THREEFOLD REFUGE

I take refuge in the Buddha;  
I take refuge in the Dharma;  
I take refuge in the Sangha.  
I take refuge in the Buddha, the incomparably honoured one;  
I take refuge in the Dharma, honourable for its purity;  
I take refuge in the Sangha, honourable for its harmonious life.  
I have finished taking refuge in the Buddha;  
I have finished taking refuge in the Dharma;  
I have finished taking refuge in the Sangha.

## IV

## THE FOUR GREAT VOWS\[1\]

However innumerable beings are, I vow to save them;  
However inexhaustible the passions are, I vow to extinguish them;  
However immeasurable the Dharmas are, I vow to master them;  
However incomparable the Buddha-truth is, I vow to attain it.

\[1. These vows are recited after every service.\]

## V

## THE WORSHIPPING OF THE SARIRA

We prostrate ourselves in all humbleness before the holy Sarira
representing the body of Sakyamuni, the Tathagata, who is perfectly
endowed with all the virtues, who has the Dharmakaya as the ground of
his being, and Dharmadhatu as the stupa dedicated to him. To him we pay
our respect with due deference. Manifesting himself in a bodily form for
our sakes, the Buddha enters into us and makes us enter into him. His
power being added to us, we attain Enlightenment; and \[again\]
dependent on the Buddha's miraculous power, all beings are benefited,
become desirous for Enlightenment, discipline themselves in the life of
the Bodhisattva, and equally enter into perfect quietude where prevails
infinite wisdom of absolute identity. We now prostrate ourselves before
him.

## VI

## THE TEACHING OF THE SEVEN BUDDHAS

Not to commit evils,  
But to do all that is good,  
And to keep one's thought pure--  
This is the teaching of all the Buddhas.

## VII

## THE GATHA OF IMPERMANENCE\[1\]

All composite things are impermanent,  
They are subject to birth and death;  
Put an end to birth and death,  
And there is a blissful tranquillity.

\[1. For the sake of the second half of this gatha the Buddha is said to
have been willing to sacrifice his own life. For this reason this is
also known as the "gatha of sacrifice".\]

## VIII

## THE YEMMEI KWANNON TEN-CLAUSE SUTRA\[1\]

\[Adoration to\] Kwanzeon!  
Adoration to the Buddha!  
To the Buddha we are related  
In terms of cause and effect.  
Depending on the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha,  
\[Nirvana is possible which is\] eternal, ever-blessed, autonomous, and
free from defilements.  
Every morning our thoughts are on Kwanzeon,  
Every evening our thoughts are on Kwanzeon.  
Every thought issues from the Mind,  
Every thought is not separated from the Mind.

\[1. Yemmei means "Prolonging life"; when one daily recites this short
document in ten clauses relating to Kwannon, one's health is assured for
doing good not only for oneself but for the whole world.\]

## IX

## PRAYER ON THE OCCASION OF FEEDING THE HUNGRY GHOSTS

If one wishes to know all the Buddhas of the past, present, and future,
one should contemplate the nature of this Dharmadhatu essentially as the
creation of Absolute Mind.  
Adoration to the Buddhas in the ten quarters;  
Adoration to the Dharma pervading the ten quarters; Adoration to the
Sangha in the ten quarters;  
Adoration to Sakyamuni the Buddha who is our Master; Adoration to
Kwanzeon the Bodhisattva, who is the great compassionate and pitying
one, ready to save beings from afflictions;  
Adoration to Ananda the Arhat who is the expounder of the Teaching.  
Namu sabo totogyato boryakite, yen!  
Sammola sammola, un!  
Namu suryoboya totogyatoya tojito, yen!  
Suryo suryo boya suryo boya suryo, somoko!  
Namu samanda motonan, ban!\[1\]  
Adoration to Hoshin\[2\] the Tathagata;  
Adoration to Taho\[3\] the Tathagata;  
Adoration to Myoshishin\[4\] the Tathagata;  
Adoration to Kohashin\[5\] the Tathagata;  
Adoration to Rifui\[6\] the Tathagata;  
Adoration to Kanroo\[7\] the Tathagata;  
Adoration to Omito\[8\] the Tathagata.  
Namu omitoboya totogyatoya,  
Toniyato,  
Omiritsubomi,  
Omirito,  
Shitabomi,  
Omirito bigyaratei,  
Omirito bigyarato gyamini,  
Gyagyano shitogyari,

\[1. It is difficult to tell how this dharani came to be inserted here.
As most dharanis are, it is devoid of sense from the human point of
view; but it may not be necessarily so to the hungry ghosts, for whom
the prayer is offered.

Can this be restored to the original Sanskrit as follows?

Namah sarva-tathagatavalokite! Om!  
Sambala, sambala! Hum!  
Namah surupaya tathagataya!  
Tadyatha,  
Om, suru\[paya\], surupaya, surupaya, suru\[paya\], svaha!  
Namah samantabuddhanam, vam!

"Be adored! O all the Tathagatas who are regarded \[as our protectors\];
Om! Provision, provision! Hum! Adored be the Tathagata Beautifully
Formed! Namely: Om! To the Beautifully-formed One! To the Beautifully
formed One! To the Beautifully-formed One! Hail! Adored be all the
Buddhas! Vam!"

2\. "Jewel-excelled" (*ratnaketu*).

3\. "Abundant-in-jewel" (*prabhutaratna*).

4\. "Fine-form-body" (*surupakaya*).

5\. "Broad-wide-body" (*vipulakaya*).

6\. "Freed-from-fear" (*abhayankara*).

7\. "Nectar-king" (*amritaraja*).

8\. "Amida" (*amitabha*).\]

Somoko.\[1\]

By the supernatural power of this Dharani the food and drink is
purified, and this we offer to the spiritual beings as numerous as the
sands of the Ganga. We pray that they shall all be fully satisfied and
abandon their greed; that they shall all leave their abodes of darkness
and be born in the blissful paths of existence; and further that taking
refuge in the Triple Treasure they shall awaken the desire for supreme
enlightenment and finally come to the realization of it. The merit they
thus attain is inexhaustible and will continue on to the end of time,
making all beings equally share in this Dharma-food.

O you hosts of spiritual beings, we make this offering of food to you
all, which we pray will fill the ten quarters and that all beings of
your kind will partake of it.

By the practice of this meritorious deed we pray that we repay what we
owe to our parents, who have done all they could for our sakes. May
those who are still alive continue to enjoy their happy and prosperous
lives for ever, while those who are no more with us be released from
suffering and born in the land of bliss.

We pray that all sentient beings in the triple world who are recipients
of the fourfold benefaction, together with those beings suffering in the
three evil paths of existence and tormented with the eight kinds of
calamities, may repent of all their sins and be cleansed of all their
sores, so that they may all be released from the cycle of transmigration
and be born in the land of purity.

We pray to all the Buddhas, all the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas in the ten
quarters, of the past, present, and future, and to Mahaprajna-paramita,
that by virtue of this merit universally prevailing, not only we but all
beings shall equally attain Buddhahood.

\[1. Namo 'mitabhaya tathagataya! Tadyatha, amritodbhave, amritasiddhe,
(?)-bhave, amritavikrante, amrita-vikranta-gamine, gaganakirtikare!
Svaha!

"Adored be the Tathagata of Infinite Light! Namely: O Nectar-raising
one! O Nectar-perfecting one! \[O Nectar-\] producing one! O One who
makes nectar pervade! O One who makes nectar universally pervade! O One
who makes nectar known as widely as space! Hail!"\]

## X

## GENERAL PRAYER\[1\]

By the Bhikshus all present here  
The mystic formula of Surangama has been recited as above,  
Which is now dedicated to all the Nagas and Devas who are protectors of
the Dharma,  
And also to all the holy assemblies of the spiritual beings who are
guardians of this monastery and surrounding district.  
May all beings in the three evil paths of existence variously suffering
the eight kinds of disasters be thereby released from the afflictions!  
May all beings in the triple world who are recipients of the fourfold
benefaction thereby participate in the merit!  
May the state continue in peaceful prosperity with all its warlike
activities stopped!  
May the wind blow in time, the rain fall seasonably, and the people live
happily!  
May the entire congregation sharing in the exercise cherish the higher
aspirations!  
To go beyond the ten stages with a cap, and this without much
difficulty!  
May this monastery keep on its quiet life, free from disturbances.  
And the patrons and devotees grow not only in faith but in wisdom and
bliss!  
\[We pray this to\] all the Buddhas and Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas in the
ten quarters, of the past, present, and future, and to
Mahaprajna-paramita!

\[1. This is read, as can be inferred from the text, after the
recitation of the Surangama dharani.\]

## XI

## PRAYER OF THE BELL

Would that the sound of the bell might go beyond our earth,  
And be heard even by all the denizens of the darkness outside the Iron
Mountains (*cakravala*) !  
Would that, their organ of hearing becoming pure, beings might attain
perfect interfusion \[of all the senses\],  
So that every one of them might come finally to the realization of
supreme enlightenment!\[1\]

\[1. It is customary in the Zen monastery to recite the *Kwannongo*
while striking the big bell, which is done three times a day. The
present gatha is recited when the striking is finished. As will be seen
below, from Kwannon issues a sound which is heard by those who sincerely
believe in his power of releasing them from every form of disaster. Each
sound emitted by the bell is the voice of Kwannon calling on us to
purify our sense of hearing, whereby a spiritual experience called
"interfusion" will finally take place in us. See under the Ryogonkyo and
the Kwannongyo below.\]
