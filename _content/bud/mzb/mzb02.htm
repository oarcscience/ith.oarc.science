<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">II. THE DHARANIS</H1>
<P>Properly speaking, the dharani has no legitimate place in Zen. That it has nevertheless crept into its daily service is clue to the general characteristics of Chinese Buddhism of the Sung dynasty, when the Japanese Zen masters visited China and imported it as they found it then, together with the Shingon elements of Chinese Zen. In China the Shingon did not thrive very long but left its traces in Zen.</P>
<I><P>Dharani</I>, the root of which is <I>dhr</I>, "to hold" or "to convey", is ordinarily translated by the Chinese <I>tsung-ch'ih</I>, "general holder", at <I>neng-ch'ih</I>, "that which holds". A dharani is considered as holding magical power in it or bearing deep meaning. When it is pronounced, whatever evil spirits there are ready to interfere with the spiritual effect of a ritual, are kept away from it.</P>
<P>In the following pages the three most frequently read dharanis are given. When translated they convey no intelligent signification. They mostly consist of invocations and exclamations. The invocation is an appeal to the higher powers, and the exclamation is to frighten away the evil spirits. That the practical result of these utterances is not to be judged objectively goes without saying.</P>
