Adoration to all Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, &Acirc;ryas, <I>S</I>r&acirc;vakas, and Pratyekabuddhas, past, present, and to come, who dwell in the unlimited and endless Lok&acirc;dhatus of the ten quarters!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 1. Thus it was heard by me. At one time the Bhagavat[1] dwelt in R&acirc;<I>g</I>ag<I>ri</I>ha, on the mountain G<I>ri</I>dhrak&ucirc;<I>t</I>a, with a large assembly of Bhikshus,</P>

<P>with thirty-two thousands of Bhikshus, all holy (arhat), free from frailties and cares, who had performed their religious duties, whose thoughts had been thoroughly freed through perfect knowledge, with inquiring thoughts, who had broken the fetters of existence, who had obtained their desires, who had conquered, who had achieved the highest self-restraint, whose thoughts and whose knowledge were unfettered, Mah&acirc;n&acirc;gas (great heroes), possessed of the six kinds of knowledge, self-controlled, meditating on the eight kinds of salvation, possessed of the powers, wise in wisdom, elders, great disciples, viz. 1. &Acirc;<I>g&ntilde;</I>&acirc;takau<I>nd</I>inya, 2.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 2. Then the blessed &Acirc;nanda, having risen from his seat, having put his cloak on one shoulder, and knelt on the earth with his right knee, making obeisance with folded hands in the direction of the Bhagavat, spoke thus to the Bhagavat: 'Thy organs of sense, O Bhagavat, are serene, the colour of thy skin is clear, the colour of thy face bright and yellowish. As an autumn cloud is pale, clear, bright and yellowish, thus the organs of sense of the Bhagavat are serene, the colour of his face is clear, the colour of his skin bright and yellowish. And as, O Bhagavat, a piece of gold coming from the <I>G</I>&acirc;mb&ucirc; river, having been thrown into a furnace by a clever smith or by his apprentice, and well fashioned, when thrown on a pale cloth, looks extremely clear, bright and yellowish, thus the organs of sense of the Bhagavat are serene, the colour of his face is clear, and the colour of his skin bright and yellowish. Moreover, I do not know, O Bhagavat, that I have ever seen the organs of sense of the Tath&acirc;gata so serene, the colour of his face so clear, and the colour of his skin so bright and yellowish before now. This thought occurs to me, O Bhagavat: probably, the Tath&acirc;gata[1] dwells today in the state of a Buddha, probably the Tath&acirc;gata dwells to-day in the state of a <I>G</I>ina, in the state of omniscience, in the state of a Mah&acirc;n&acirc;ga; and he contemplates the holy and fully enlightened Tath&acirc;gatas of the past, future, and present.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these words, the Bhagavat thus spoke to the blessed &Acirc;nanda: 'Well said! well said! &Acirc;nanda. Did the gods suggest this matter to you? or the</P>

<P><SMALL>[1. That is, Buddha <I>S</I>&acirc;kyamuni.]</SMALL></P>

<!----------------------p. 4---------------------->

<P><A NAME="p. 4">{p. 4}</A></P>

<P>blessed Buddhas? Or do you know this through the philosophical knowledge which you possess?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these words the blessed &Acirc;nanda spoke thus to the Bhagavat: 'The gods, O Bhagavat, do not suggest this matter to me, nor the blessed Buddhas, but this thought occurs to me by my own philosophy alone, viz. that probably the Tath&acirc;gata dwells to-day in the state of a Buddha, probably the Tath&acirc;gata dwells to-day in the state of a <I>G</I>ina, in the state of omniscience, [in the state of a Mah&acirc;n&acirc;ga][1]; or he contemplates [the venerable Buddhas] of the past, future, and present.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these words the Bhagavat spoke thus to the blessed &Acirc;nanda: 'Well said! well said! &Acirc;nanda; excellent indeed is your question[2], good your philosophy, and beautiful your understanding! You, O &Acirc;nanda, have arrived for the benefit and happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the sake of the great body of men, for the benefit and happiness of gods and men, as you think it right to ask the Tath&acirc;gata this matter[3]: Thus, indeed, &Acirc;nanda might pile up[4] intellectual knowledge under immeasurable and innumerable blessed, holy, and fully enlightened Tath&acirc;gatas, and yet the knowledge of the Tath&acirc;gata would not be exceeded thereby. And why? Because, O &Acirc;nanda, one who possesses the knowledge of a Tath&acirc;gata possesses an intellectual knowledge of causes that cannot be</P>

<P>exceeded[1]. If[2] the Tath&acirc;gata wished, O &Acirc;nanda, he could live for a whole kalpa (age) on one alms-gift, or for a hundred kalpas, or for a thousand kalpas, or for a hundred thousand kalpas, to a hundred thousand niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of kalpas[3], nay, he could live beyond, and yet the organs of nature of the Tath&acirc;gata would not perish, the colour of his face would not be altered, nor would the colour of his skin be injured. And why? Because, O &Acirc;nanda, the Tath&acirc;gata has so fully obtained the P&acirc;ramit&acirc;s[4] which arise from Sam&acirc;dhi[5]. The appearance of fully enlightened Buddhas is very difficult to be obtained in this world, O &Acirc;nanda. As the appearance of Audumbara-flowers is very difficult to be obtained in this world; thus, O &Acirc;nanda, the appearance of Tath&acirc;gatas who desire welfare, wish for what is beneficial, are compassionate, and have arrived at the highest compassion, is very difficult to be obtained. But, O &Acirc;nanda, it is (owing to) the grace of the Tath&acirc;gata himself that you think that the Tath&acirc;gata should be asked this question, so that there may arise in this world beings who can be teachers of all the world, for the sake of noble-minded Bodhisattvas. Therefore, O &Acirc;nanda, listen, and take it well and rightly to heart! I shall tell you.'</P>

<P><SMALL>[1. I am not satisfied with this translation, but I do not think that <I>g&ntilde;</I>&acirc;na, even in Buddhist Sanskrit, could ever be used as a masculine, and I therefore take tath&acirc;gata<I>g&ntilde;</I>&acirc;na<I>h</I> as a Bahuvr&icirc;hi.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yes, O Bhagavat,' so did the blessed &Acirc;nanda answer the Bhagavat.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 3. The Bhagavat then spoke to &Acirc;nanda: 'At the time, O &Acirc;nanda, which was long ago in the past, in an innumerable and more than innumerable, enormous, immeasurable, and incomprehensible kalpa before now,--at that time, and at that moment, there arose in the world a holy and fully enlightened Tath&acirc;gata called 1.

And again during the time of the preaching of this holy and fully enlightened Tath&acirc;gata Loke<I>s</I>varar&acirc;<I>g</I>a, O &Acirc;nanda, there was a Bhikshu, Dharm&acirc;kara by name, richly endowed with memory, with understanding, prudence, and wisdom,--richly endowed with vigour, and of noble character.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 4. 'Then, O &Acirc;nanda, that Bhikshu Dharm&acirc;kara, having risen from his seat, having put his cloak on one shoulder, and knelt on the earth with his right knee, stretching forth his folded hands to where the Bhagavat Tath&acirc;gata Loke<I>s</I>varar&acirc;<I>g</I>a was, and, after worshipping the Bhagavat, he, at thar very time, praised him in his presence with these G&acirc;th&acirc;s[1]:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The form also is infinite in the best of beings[1]; thus also the voice of Buddha is of infinite sound; his virtue likewise, with meditation, knowledge[2], strength; like unto thee there is no one in this world. (2)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Law (dharma) is deep, wide, and subtle; the best of Buddhas is incomprehensible, like the ocean; therefore there is no further exaltation of the teacher; having left all faults, he is gone to the other shore[3]. (3)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then the best of Buddhas[4], of endless light, lights up all regions, he the king of kings; and I, having become Buddha, and a master of the Law, may I deliver mankind from old age and death! (4)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I, on the strength of generosity, equanimity, virtue, forbearance, power, meditation and absorption, undertake here the first and best duties, and shall become a Buddha, the saviour of all beings. (5)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I, seeking for the knowledge of the best of the Blessed Ones, shall always worship many hundred thousands of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of Buddhas, endless like the sand of the Gang&acirc;, the incomparable lords. (6)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beings[3] come hither from the ten quarters; having arrived there they quickly show my happiness. May Buddha there teach me the truth,--I form a desire full of true strength and vigour. (9)</P>

<P>unequalled. And may the Bhagavat proclaim those signs by which I may comprehend the perfection of all good qualities of a Buddha country."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'After this, O &Acirc;nanda, the Bhagavat Loke<I>s</I>varar&acirc;<I>g</I>a, the Tath&acirc;gata, thus spoke to that Bhikshu:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you by yourself, O Bhikshu, know the perfection of all excellences and good qualities of a Buddha country?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He said: "O Bhagavat, I could not do this, but the Bhagavat alone. Explain the perfection of the excellences and all the good qualities of Buddha countries of the other Tath&acirc;gatas, after hearing which we may fulfil every one of their signs."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Then, O &Acirc;nanda, the Tath&acirc;gata Loke<I>s</I>varar&acirc;<I>g</I>a, holy and fully enlightened, knowing the good disposition of that Bhikshu, taught for a full ko<I>t</I>&icirc; of years the perfection of all the excellences and good qualities of Buddha countries belonging to eighty-one hundred thousand niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of Buddhas, together with the signs, indication, and description, desiring welfare, wishing for benefits, compassionate, full of compassion, so that there might never be an end of Buddha countries, having conceived great pity for all beings. The measure of life of that Tath&acirc;gata was full forty kalpas.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 6. 'Then, O &Acirc;nanda, that Bhikshu Dharm&acirc;kara, taking the perfections of all the excellences and good qualities of those Buddha countries, of those eighty-one hundred thousand niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of Buddhas, and concentrating them all on one Buddha country, worshipped with his head the feet of the Bhagavat Loke<I>s</I>varar&acirc;<I>g</I>a, the Tath&acirc;gata, turned respectfully round him to the right, and walked away from the presence of this Bhagavat. And</P>

<P>afterwards, for the space of five kalpas, he thus concentrated the perfection of all the excellences and good qualities of the Buddha countries, such as had never been known before in the ten quarters of the whole world, more excellent, and more perfect than any, and composed the most excellent prayer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 7. 'Thus, O &Acirc;nanda, that Bhikshu concentrated in his mind a perfection of a Buddha country eighty-one times more immeasurable, noble, and excellent than the perfection of the eighty-one hundred thousand niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of Buddha countries that had been told him by the Bhagavat Loke<I>s</I>varar&acirc;<I>g</I>a, the Tath&acirc;gata. And then, proceeding to where the Tath&acirc;gata was, he worshipped the feet of the Bhagavat with his head, and said: "O Bhagavat, the perfection of all the excellences and good qualities of the Buddha countries has been concentrated by me."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'After this, O &Acirc;nanda, the Tath&acirc;gata Loke<I>s</I>varar&acirc;<I>g</I>a thus spoke to the Bhikshu: "Preach then, O Bhikshu;--the Tath&acirc;gata allows it. Now is the proper time, O Bhikshu. Delight the assembly, produce joy, let the lion's voice be heard, so that now and hereafter, noble-minded Bodhisattvas, hearing it, may comprehend the different subjects (or occasions) of the prayers for the perfection of the good qualities of a Buddha country."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Then, O &Acirc;nanda, that Bhikshu Dharm&acirc;kara thus spoke at that time to the Bhagavat: "May the Bhagavat thus listen to me, to what my own prayers are, and how, after I shall have obtained the highest perfect knowledge, my own Buddha country will then be endowed with all inconceivable excellences and good qualities.</P>

Then, performing the duties of a Bodhisattva, after having given up all speaking which, when spoken, serves to injure one's self or others or both, he employed only such speech as served the pleasure and benefit of himself, others, or both. And he was so wise that, when entering into capitals, kingdoms, countries, towns, cities, and villages, he was always perfectly restrained with regard to all objects of sense. Performing</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'By him, while he was thus performing the duties of a Bodhisattva, immeasurable and innumerable hundreds of thousands of niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of beings were established in perfect enlightenment, of whom it is not easy to know the limit by means of speech.

It is not easy to know the limit by pointing it out in words as to how many beings were established by him in the noble families of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, Kshatriyas, ministers, householders, and merchants.

So many immeasurable and innumerable Buddhas were honoured, revered, esteemed, and worshipped, and requested to turn the wheel of the Law, of whom it is not easy to know the limit by means of words.</P>

And there appeared also, streaming forth from the palms of his hands, all kinds of viands and drink, food, hard and soft, and sweetmeats, and all kinds of enjoyments and pleasures. Thus then that Bhikshu Dharm&acirc;kara, O &Acirc;nanda, had obtained the command of all necessaries, after performing the duties of a Bodhisattva.'</P>

There is not, O &Acirc;nanda, any case of likeness, by which the extent of the light of that Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha could be understood. Hence, O &Acirc;nanda, for that reason that Tath&acirc;gata is called Amit&acirc;bha (possessed of infinite light), and he is called Amitaprabha (possessed of infinite splendour), Amitaprabh&acirc;sa (possessed of infinite brilliancy), Asam&acirc;ptaprabha (whose light is never finished), Asangataprabha (whose light is not conditioned), Prabh&acirc;<I>s</I>ikhots<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>aprabha (whose light proceeds from flames of light), Sadivyama<I>n</I>iprabha, (whose light is that of heavenly jewels), Apratihatara<I>s</I>mir&acirc;gaprabha (whose light has the colour of unimpeded rays), R&acirc;<I>g</I>an&icirc;yaprabha (possessed of beautiful light), Prema<I>n</I>&icirc;yaprabha, (possessed of lovely light), Pramodan&icirc;yaprabha (possessed of delightful light), Sangaman&icirc;yaprabha (possessed of attractive light), Uposha<I>n</I>&icirc;yaprabha (possessed of pleasant light), Anibandhan&icirc;yaprabha[1] (possessed of light that cannot be stopped), Ativ&icirc;ryaprabha, (possessed of extremely powerful light), Atulyaprabha, (possessed of incomparable light), Abhibh&ucirc;yanarendr&acirc;bh&ucirc;trayendraprabha[2] (possessed of light greater than that of</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This splendour of the &Acirc;rya (noble) is pure, great, producing bodily pleasure, happiness of mind, producing happiness, delight, and joy for men and not-men, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, Garu<I>d</I>as, Gandharvas, Yakshas, N&acirc;gas, Asuras, and Devas; and producing the pleasure of beings of good disposition[1].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And in this manner, O &Acirc;nanda, the Tath&acirc;gata[2] might speak for a whole kalpa on the work of the Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha, beginning with his light, and yet he would not be able to reach the end of the virtues of that light of that Tath&acirc;gata, neither would there be any failure of the self-confidence in the Tath&acirc;gata himself. And why? Because, O &Acirc;nanda, both these things are immeasurable, innumerable, inconceivable, and endless, viz. first, the greatness of the excellence of the light of that Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha, the Bhagavat, and secondly, the unsurpassed light of the knowledge possessed by the Tath&acirc;gata (by myself).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 13. 'And, O &Acirc;nanda, the assembly of the hearers of that Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha is immeasurable, so that it is not easy to learn its measure, so as to be able to say, there are so many ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of the hearers, so many hundreds, thousands, hundred-thousands, kankaras, vimbaras, nayutas (niyutas?), ayutas, akshobhyas, viv&acirc;has (masc.), srotas (?), o<I>g</I>as[1], so many periods, called immeasurable, innumerable, countless, incomparable, inconceivable. Now, for instance, O &Acirc;nanda, the Bhikshu Maudgaly&acirc;yana having obtained miraculous power, might, if he wished, count[2] in one day and night, how many kinds of stars there are in the universal world. Then, let there be a hundred thousand niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of such men, endowed with miraculous powers, and let them do nothing else but count the first company (only) of the hearers of the Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha, during a hundred thousand niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of years, and yet by them thus counting even the hundredth part would not be counted, even the thousandth, even the hundred thousandth, nay, not even so far as the minutest part, or likeness, or approach[3] towards it would have been counted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thus, for instance, O &Acirc;nanda, a man might throw out from the great ocean, which is not to be measured across by less than eighty-four thousand yo<I>g</I>anas, one single drop of water by the sharp end of hair, which is divided a hundred times.

<P>sharp pointed hair divided a hundred times, or the mass of water left in the great ocean?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Acirc;nanda said: 'Even a thousand yo<I>g</I>anas, O Bhagavat, would be a small portion of the great ocean, how much more then one drop of water thrown out by the sharp pointed hair divided a hundred times!'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhagavat said: 'As that one drop of water, exactly so large (so small in proportion) was the first company of the hearers. And let there be reckoning made by those Bhikshus, who are like Maudgaly&acirc;yana, counting for a hundred thousand niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of years, and yet, as to the mass of water left in the great ocean, it would even then have to be considered as not counted. How much more with regard to the second, third, and the rest of the companies of the hearers! Therefore the mass of hearers of the Bhagavat is endless and boundless, and receives the name of "immeasurable and innumerable."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 14. 'And, O &Acirc;nanda, the length of the life of that Bhagavat Amit&acirc;bha, the Tath&acirc;gata, is immeasurable, so that it is not easy to know its length, so as to be able to say (that it comprises) so many hundreds of kalpas, so many thousands of kalpas, so many hundred thousands of kalpas, so many ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of kalpas, so many hundreds of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of kalpas, so many thousands of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of kalpas, so many hundred thousands of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of kalpas, so many hundred thousands of niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of kalpas. Therefore, O &Acirc;nanda, the limit of the measure of the life of that Bhagavat is immeasurable indeed. Therefore that Tath&acirc;gata is called Amit&acirc;yus.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And as, O &Acirc;nanda, the rule of making known the reckoning of kalpas exists here in this world, ten kalpas have passed now since Bhagavat Amit&acirc;yus,</P>

Then, O &Acirc;nanda, in that world there are neither hells, nor the brute creation, nor the realm of departed spirits, nor bodies of Asuras, nor untimely births[1].

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 16.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And, O &Acirc;nanda, the roots, trunks, branches, small branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits of all those trees are pleasant to touch, and fragrant. And, when those (trees) are moved by the wind, a sweet and delightful sound proceeds from them, never</P>

<P>tiring, and never disagreeable to hear. That Buddha country, O &Acirc;nanda, is always on every side surrounded by such trees made of the seven gems, by masses of Kadal&icirc; (banana) trees, and rows of palm-trees made of the seven gems, and entirely surrounded with golden nets, and wholly covered with lotus flowers, made of all kinds of gems.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are lotus flowers there, half a yo<I>g</I>ana in circumference.

And from each gem-lotus there proceed thirty-six hundred thousand ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of rays of light. And from each ray of light there proceed thirty-six hundred thousand ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of Buddhas, with bodies of golden-colour, possessed of the thirty-two marks of great men, who go and teach the Law to beings in the immeasurable and innumerable worlds in the eastern quarter. Thus also in the southern, western, and northern quarters, above and below, in the cardinal and intermediate points, they go their way to the immeasurable and innumerable worlds and teach the Law to beings in the whole world.</P>

And that Buddha country is level on every side, lovely, like the palm of the hand, with districts full of jewels and treasures of every kind.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, the blessed &Acirc;nanda spoke thus to the Bhagavat: 'But in that case, O Bhagavat, where</P>

<P><A NAME="p. 37">{p. 37}</A></P>

<P>do the gods consisting of the companies of the four Mah&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>as who dwell on the side of the Sumeru, and where do the Tr&acirc;yastri<I>ms</I>a gods who dwell on the top of the Sumeru, find their place?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O &Acirc;nanda, where do these other beings find their place, who in this world dwell above the king of mountains, Sumeru, namely, the Y&acirc;madevas, Tushitas, Nirm&acirc;<I>n</I>aratis, Paranirmitava<I>s</I>avartins, Brahmak&acirc;yikas, Brahmapurohitas, Mah&acirc;brahmans, as far as the Akanish<I>th</I>as?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Acirc;nanda replied: 'O Bhagavat, the result of works and the outcome of works are inconceivable' (i.e. I do not understand it).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhagavat said: 'Here, you see, the result of works and the outcome of works are inconceivable. But to the blessed Buddhas the position of Buddhas is not inconceivable, while to thee the holy and miraculous power of virtuous beings, whose stock of merit has become ripened, seems inconceivable.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Acirc;nanda said: 'I had no doubt on this, no difference of opinion, or hesitation; on the contrary, I ask only the Tath&acirc;gata about this matter in order to destroy the doubts, the differences of opinion, and the hesitations of future beings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhagavat said: 'All right, &Acirc;nanda, this is what you ought to do.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 18. 'In that world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;, O &Acirc;nanda, there flow different kinds of rivers; there are great rivers there, one yo<I>g</I>ana in breadth; there are rivers up to twenty, thirty, forty, fifty yo<I>g</I>anas in breadth, and up to twelve yo<I>g</I>anas in depth. All these rivers are delightful, carrying water of different sweet odour, carrying bunches of flowers adorned with various</P>

<!----------------------p. 38---------------------->

<P><A NAME="p. 38">{p. 38}</A></P>

<P>gems, resounding with sweet voices. [1]And, O &Acirc;nanda, there proceeds from an instrument which consists of hundred thousand ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of parts, which embodies heavenly music and is played by clever people, the same delightful sound which proceeds from those great rivers, the sound which is deep, unknown, incomprehensible, clear, pleasant to the ear, touching the heart, beloved, sweet, delightful, never tiring, never disagreeable, pleasant to hear, as if it always said, "Non-eternal, peaceful, unreal." Such a sound comes to be heard by these beings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And again, O &Acirc;nanda, the borders of those great rivers on both sides are filled with jewel trees of various scents, from which bunches of flowers, leaves, and branches of all kinds hang down. And if the beings, who are on the borders of those rivers, wish to enjoy sport full of heavenly delights, the water rises to the ankle only after they have stepped into the rivers, if they wish it to be so; or if they wish it, the water rises to their knees, to their hips, to their sides, and to their ears. And heavenly pleasures arise. Again, if the beings then wish the water to be cold, it is cold; if they wish it to be hot, it is hot; if they wish it to be hot and cold, it is hot and cold, according to their pleasure.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And those great rivers flow along, full of water scented with the best perfumes of the Uragas&acirc;ra sandal-wood, of Tagaras, K&acirc;l&acirc;nus&acirc;rin (dark, fragrant sandal-wood) trees, Agarus, and heavenly Tam&acirc;lapattras; covered with flowers of the white water-lilies, and heavenly Utpalas, Padmas, Kumudas, and Pu<I>nd</I>arikas; full of delightful sounds of peacocks,</P>

And when these beings there desire, thinking what kind of wishes should be fulfilled for them, then exactly such wishes are fulfilled for them according to the Law[2].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And, O &Acirc;nanda, the sound which rises from that water is delightful, and the whole Buddha country is aroused by it. And if beings, who stand on the borders of the river, wish that the sound should not come within their ear-shot, then it does not come within their ear-shot, even if they are possessed of the heavenly ear. And whatever sound a man wishes to hear, exactly that delightful sound he hears, as for instance, the sound "Buddha, Dharma (the Law), Sangha (the Church), the P&acirc;ramit&acirc;s (highest perfections), the Bh&ucirc;mis (stages), the Balas (powers), Vai<I>s</I>&acirc;radya (perfections), &Acirc;ve<I>n</I>ikabuddhadharma (freedom from attachment), Pratisa<I>m</I>vit (consciousness); <I>S</I>&ucirc;nyat&acirc; (emptiness), Animitta (unconditioned), Apra<I>n</I>ihita (free from desire), Anabhisa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ra (not made), A<I>g</I>&acirc;ta (not born), Anutp&acirc;da (without origin), Abh&acirc;va (not being), and Nirodha (cessation); <I>S</I>&acirc;nta, pra<I>s</I>&acirc;nta, and upa<I>s</I>&acirc;nta (peace); Mah&acirc;maitr&icirc; (great love), Mah&acirc;karu<I>n</I>&acirc; (great pity), Mah&acirc;mudit&acirc; (great rejoicing), and Mahopeksh&acirc; (great forgiveness); Anutpattikadharmaksh&acirc;nti</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And having heard these sounds, everybody feels the highest delight and pleasure accompanied by retirement, passionlessness, quiet, cessation, law, and a stock of merit leading to the perfect knowledge.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And, O &Acirc;nanda, there is nowhere in that Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc; world any sound of sin, obstacle, misfortune, distress, and destruction; there is nowhere any sound of pain, even the sound of perceiving what is neither pain nor pleasure is not there, O &Acirc;nanda, how much less the sound of pain. For that reason, O &Acirc;nanda, that world is called Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;, shortly, but not in full. For, O &Acirc;nanda, the whole kalpa would come to an end, while the different causes of the pleasure of the world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc; are being praised, and even then the end of those causes of happiness could not be reached.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 19. 'And again, O &Acirc;nanda, the beings, who have been and will be born in that world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;, will be endowed with such colour, strength, vigour, height and breadth, dominion, accumulation of virtue[1]; with such enjoyments of dress, ornaments, gardens, palaces, and pavilions; and such enjoyments of touch, taste, smell, and sound; in fact with all enjoyments and pleasures, exactly like the Paranirmitava<I>s</I>avartin gods.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And again, O &Acirc;nanda, in that world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;, beings do not take food consisting of gross materials of gravy or molasses; but whatever food they desire, such food they perceive, as if it were taken,</P>

<P>Buddha country is adorned on every side seven fathoms deep. As a clever man might spread out a flower-bed on the earth and make it even with both his hands, beautiful and charming, even thus with those flowers of various scents and colours that Buddha country is shining on every side seven fathoms deep. And these many flowers are soft, pleasant to touch, if one may use a comparison, like K&acirc;<I>k</I>ilindika (some kind of soft substance). If one puts one's foot on them, they sink down four inches; if one raises one's foot, they rise again four inches. When the time of the forenoon has gone again, those flowers vanish without leaving anything behind. Then that Buddha country is again clean, pleasant, beautiful, and without fading flowers. The winds blow again everywhere in the four quarters, and scatter down fresh flowers as before. And as it is in the forenoon, so it is at noon, at twilight, in the first, middle, and last watch of the night. And the beings, if touched by those winds which blow perfume with various scents, are as full of happiness as a Bhikshu (mendicant) who has obtained Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 22. 'And in that Buddha country, O &Acirc;nanda, no mention is ever made of the names of fire, sun, moon, planets, Nakshatras (constellations), and stars, or of blinding darkness. There is no mention even of day and night, except in the conversation of the Tath&acirc;gata. Nor is there any idea of predial property belonging to monasteries.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 23. 'And again, O &Acirc;nanda, in that world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc; at the proper time clouds full of heavenly perfumed water pour down heavenly flowers of all colours; heavenly seven jewels, heavenly sandalwood-powder, and heavenly umbrellas, flags, and</P>

<P>banners are poured down. And in the sky, the heavenly flowers of all colours, and heavenly canopies are held, likewise heavenly excellent umbrellas and all kinds of ornaments, heavenly musical instruments are played, and heavenly Apsarases dance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 24. 'And again, O &Acirc;nanda, in that Buddha country whatever beings have been born, and are being born, and will be born, are always constant in absolute truth, till they have reached Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a. And why is that? Because there is no room or mention there of the other two divisions (r&acirc;<I>s</I>is), such as beings not constant or constant in falsehood.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On this wise, O &Acirc;nanda, that world is briefly called Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;, not at full length.

The best thing, however, is to have faith in <I>G</I>ina, and to drive away all doubt. The Tibetan translator gives a translation of seven verses, but his translation also seems as obscure as the original.]</SMALL></P>

And why? Because all beings who hear the name of the blessed Amit&acirc;bha, and having heard it, raise their thought with joyful longing, even for once only, will not turn away again from the highest perfect knowledge.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 27. 'And before the eyes of those beings, O &Acirc;nanda, who again and again think of the Tath&acirc;gata reverently, and who make the great and unmeasured stock of good works grow, turning their thought towards Bodhi (knowledge), and who pray to be born in that world, Amit&acirc;bha, the Tath&acirc;gata, holy and fully enlightened, when the time of their death has approached, will appear, surrounded by many companies of Bhikshus and honoured by them. And then these beings, having seen the Bhagavat, their thoughts filled with joy, will, when they have died, be born in that world of Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;. And if, O &Acirc;nanda, any son or daughter of a good family should wish--What?--How then may I see that Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha visibly, then he must raise his thought on to the highest perfect knowledge, he must direct his thought with perseverance and excessive desire towards that Buddha country, and direct the stock of his good works towards being born there.</P>

'But before the eyes of those who do not care much about the Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha, and who do not vigorously increase the great and unmeasured stock of their good works, the Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha, holy and fully enlightened, will appear, at the time of death, with the company of Bhikshus, in breadth</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 29. 'And again, O &Acirc;nanda, those beings who meditate on the Tath&acirc;gata by giving him the ten thoughts, and who will direct their desire towards that Buddha country, and who will feel satisfaction when the profound doctrines are being preached, and who will not fall off, nor despair, nor fail, but will meditate on that Tath&acirc;gata, if it were by one thought only, and will direct their desire toward that Buddha country, they also will see the Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha, while they are in a dream, they will be born in the world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;, and will never turn away from the highest perfect knowledge.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 30. 'And, O &Acirc;nanda, after thus seeing the cause and effect, the Tath&acirc;gatas of the ten quarters, in immeasurable and innumerable worlds, glorify the name of the Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha, preach his fame, and proclaim his praise. And again, O &Acirc;nanda, in that Buddha country, Bodhisattvas equal in number to the sand of the Gang&acirc; approach, from the ten quarters, and in each quarter towards that Tath&acirc;gata Amit&acirc;bha, in order to see him, to bow before him, to worship him, to consult him, and likewise in order to see that company of Bodhisattvas, and the different kinds of perfection in the multitude of ornaments and excellences belonging to that Buddha country.'</P>

<P>to illustrate this matter in fuller measure, recited these verses[1]:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. 'These many Bodhisattvas having worshipped and revered the feet of Amitaprabha, and having walked round him respectfully, speak thus: "Oh, the country of Buddha shines wonderfully!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. 'And they cover him again with handfulls of flowers, with thoughts jubilant, with incomparable joy, and proclaim their wish before that lord: "May our country also be such as this."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. '"By us also all the gain has been well gained, because we have come to this Buddha country. See this dream-like country[1] how beautiful it is, which was made by the teacher during a hundred thousand kalpas.</P>

<P>sending forth the weapons of knowledge, possessed of purity, shining, free from faults and taints, endowed with memory, resting on serene knowledge. And such, O &Acirc;nanda, are the beings in that Buddha country, stated briefly. But if the Tath&acirc;gatas should describe them fully, even in a length of life that should last for a hundred thousand niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of kalpas, yet the end of the virtues of those good people would not be reached, and yet there would be no failure of the self-confidence of the Tath&acirc;gata. And why? Because, O &Acirc;nanda, both are indeed inconceivable and incomparable, viz. first, the virtues of those Bodhisattvas, and secondly, the unsurpassed light of knowledge of the Tath&acirc;gata[1].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 39. 'And now, O &Acirc;nanda, stand up, facing westward, and having taken a handful of flowers, fall down. This is the quarter where that Bhagavat Amit&acirc;bha, the Tath&acirc;gata, holy and fully enlightened, dwells, remains, supports himself, and teaches the Law, whose spotless and pure name, famed in every quarter of the whole world with its ten quarters, the blessed Buddhas, equal to (the grains of) the sand of the river Gang&acirc;, speaking and answering again and again without stopping, extol, praise, and eulogize.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, the blessed &Acirc;nanda said this to the Bhagavat: 'I wish, O Bhagavat, to see that Amit&acirc;bha, Amitaprabha, Amit&acirc;yus, the Tath&acirc;gata, holy and fully enlightened, and those noble-minded Bodhisattvas, who are possessed of a stock of merit amassed under many hundred thousand niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of Buddhas.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment this speech was spoken by the blessed &Acirc;nanda, and immediately that Amit&acirc;bha, the Tath&acirc;gata, holy and fully enlightened, let such a ray of light go out of the palm of his own hand, that even the most distant Buddha country was shining with the great splendour. And again at that time, whatever black mountains, or jewel-mountains, or Merus, great Merus, Mu<I>k</I>ilindas, great Mu<I>k</I>ilindas, <I>K</I>akrav&acirc;<I>d</I>as, great <I>K</I>akrav&acirc;<I>d</I>as, or erections, or pillars, trees, woods, gardens, palaces, belonging to the gods and men, exist everywhere in hundred thousand ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of Buddha countries; all these were pervaded and overcome by the light of that Tath&acirc;gata. And as a man, followed by another at a distance of a fathom only, would see the other man, when the sun has risen, exactly in the same manner the Bhikshus, Bhikshu<I>n</I>&icirc;s, Up&acirc;sakas (laymen), Up&acirc;sik&acirc;s (laywomen), gods, N&acirc;gas, Yakshas, R&acirc;kshasas, Gandharvas, Asuras, Garu<I>d</I>as, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, men and not-men, in this Buddha country, saw at that time that Amit&acirc;bha, the Tath&acirc;gata, holy and fully enlightened, like the Sumeru, the king of mountains, elevated above all countries, surpassing all quarters, shining, warming, glittering, blazing; and they saw that great mass of Bodhisattvas, and that company of Bhikshus, viz. by the grace of Buddha, from the pureness of that light. And as this great earth might be, when all covered with water, so that no trees, no mountains, no islands, no grasses, bushes, herbs, large trees, no rivers, chasms, water-falls, would be seen, but only the one great earth which had all become an ocean, in exactly the same manner there is neither mark nor sign whatever to be seen in that Buddha courtry, except <I>S</I>r&acirc;vakas,</P>

And that Bhagavat Amit&acirc;bha, the Tath&acirc;gata, holy and fully enlightened, overshadowing that mass of <I>S</I>r&acirc;vakas and that mass of Bodhisattvas, is seen, illuminating all quarters. Again at that time all those Bodhisattvas, <I>S</I>r&acirc;vakas, gods and men in that world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;, saw this world Sah&acirc; and <I>S</I>&acirc;kyamuni, the Tath&acirc;gata, holy and fully enlightened, surrounded by a holy company of Bhikshus, teaching the Law.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A<I>g</I>ita said: 'I see, O Bhagavat.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O A<I>g</I>ita, is there any difference between the gods called Paranirmitava<I>s</I>avartins, and men in the world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A<I>g</I>ita said: 'I do not, O Bhagavat, perceive even one difference, so far as the men in that world of Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc; are endowed with great supernatural powers.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bhagavat said: 'Do you see again, O A<I>g</I>ita, those men dwelling within the calyx of excellent lotus-flowers in that world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: 'As gods called Tr&acirc;yastri<I>m</I>sas or Y&acirc;mas, having entered into palaces of fifty or hundred or five hundred yo<I>g</I>anas in extent, are playing, sporting, walking about, exactly in the same manner I see, O Bhagavat, these men dwelling within the calyx of excellent lotus-flowers in the world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&sect; 41. 'Again there are, O Bhagavat, beings who, being born miraculously, appear sitting cross-legged in the lotus-flowers. What is there, O Bhagavat, the cause, what the reason, that some dwell within the calyx, while others, being born miraculously, appear sitting cross-legged in the lotus-flowers?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bhagavat said: 'Those Bodhisattvas, O A<I>g</I>ita, who, living in other Buddha countries, entertain doubt about being born in the world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;, and with that thought amass a stock of merit, for them there is the dwelling within the calyx.

And those noble-minded Bodhisattvas, O A<I>g</I>ita, who, living in other Buddha countries, raise their thought in order to see Amit&acirc;bha, the Tath&acirc;gata, holy and fully enlightened, who never entertain a doubt, believe in the perfect knowledge of Buddha and in their own stock of merit, for them, being born miraculously, and appearing cross-legged, there is, in one minute, such a body as that of other beings who have been born there long before. See, O A<I>g</I>ita, the excellent, immeasurable, unfailing, unlimited wisdom, that namely for their own benefit they are deprived during five hundred years of seeing Buddhas, seeing Bodhisattvas, hearing the Law, speaking about the Law (with others), and thus collecting a stock of merit; they are indeed deprived of the successful attainment of every stock of merit, and that through their forming ideas tainted with doubt.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And, O A<I>g</I>ita, there might be a dungeon belonging to an anointed Kshatriya king, inlaid entirely with gold and beryl, in which cushions, garlands, wreaths and strings are fixed, having canopies of different colours and kind, covered with silk cushions, scattered over with various flowers and blossoms, scented with excellent scents, adorned with arches, courts, windows, pinnacles, fire-places, and terraces, covered with nets of bells of the seven kinds of gems, having four angles, four pillars, four doors, four stairs; and the son of that king having been</P>

There he might be then either sitting or resting. And there might be brought to him much food and drink, of various kinds, pure and well prepared. What do you think, O A<I>g</I>ita, would the enjoyment be great for that prince?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A<I>g</I>ita said: 'Yes[2], it would be great, O Bhagavat.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bhagavat said: 'What do you think, O A<I>g</I>ita, would he even taste it there, and notice it, or would he feel any satisfaction from it?'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: 'Not indeed, O Bhagavat; but on the contrary, when he had been led away by the king and thrown into the dungeon, he would only wish for deliverance from there. He would seek for the nobles, princes, ministers, women[3], elders (rich merchants), householders, and lords of castles, who might deliver him from that dungeon.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bhagavat said: 'Thus, O A<I>g</I>ita, it is with those Bodhisattvas who, having fallen into doubt, amass a stock of merit, but doubt the knowledge of Buddha. They are born in that world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;,</P>

<P>through the hearing of Buddha's name, and through the serenity of thought only; they do not, however, appear sitting cross-legged in the flowers of the lotus, being born miraculously, but dwell only in the calyx of the lotus-flowers. Moreover for them there exist ideas of palaces and gardens[1]. There is no discharge, there is no phlegm or mucus, there is nothing disagreeable to the mind. But they are deprived of seeing Buddhas, hearing the Law, seeing Bodhisattvas, speaking about and ascertaining the Law, (gathering) any (new) stock of merit, and practising the Law, during five hundred years. Moreover they do not rejoice there or perceive satisfaction. But they wish to remove one another, and then they step out behind. And it is not known whether their exit takes place above, below, or across. See, O A<I>g</I>ita, there might be worshippings of many hundred thousand niyutas of ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of Buddhas during those five hundred years, and also many, immense, innumerable, immeasurable stocks of merit to be amassed. But all this they destroy by the fault of doubt. See, O A<I>g</I>ita, to how great an injury the doubt of the Bodhisattvas leads. Therefore now, O A<I>g</I>ita, after the Bodhisattvas without doubting have quickly raised their thoughts towards the Bodhi, in order to obtain power of conferring happiness for the benefit of all creatures, their stock of merit should be turned towards their being born in the world Sukh&acirc;vat&icirc;, where the blessed Amit&acirc;bha, the Tath&acirc;gata, holy and fully enlightened, dwells.'</P>

Because ko<I>t</I>&icirc;s of Bodhisattvas indeed, O A<I>g</I>ita, return from the highest perfect knowledge, on account of not hearing such treatises of the Law as this. Therefore, from a wish for this treatise of the Law, a great effort should be made to hear, learn, and remember it, and to study it for the sake of fully grasping it and widely making it known. A good copy of it should be kept, after it has been copied in a book, if only during one night and day, or even during the time necessary for milking a cow. The name of Master should be given to a teacher who desires to conduct quickly innumerable beings to the state of never returning from the highest perfect knowledge, namely, in order that they may see the Buddha country of that blessed Amit&acirc;bha, the Tath&acirc;gata, and to acquire the excellent perfection of the array of good qualities peculiar to his own Buddha country.</P>

And those also who, when they have heard it, shall obtain excellent delight and pleasure, and will learn, retain, recite and grasp, and wisely preach it to others, and be delighted by its study, or, having copied it at least, will worship it, will certainly produce much good work, so that it is difficult to count it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thus indeed, O A<I>g</I>ita, I have done what a Tath&acirc;gata ought to do. It is now for you to devote yourself to it without any doubt. Do not doubt the perfect and unfailing knowledge of Buddha. Do not enter into the dungeon made of gems built up in every way. For indeed, the birth of a Buddha, O A<I>g</I>ita, is difficult to be met with, so is the instruction in the Law, and also a timely birth[1]. O A<I>g</I>ita, the way to gain the perfection (p&acirc;ramit&acirc;) of all stocks of merit has been proclaimed by me. Do now exert yourselves and move forward.
