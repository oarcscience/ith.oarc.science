<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Then when the sun, the eye of the world, was just risen, he, the noblest of men, beheld the hermitage of the son of Bh<I>ri</I>gu,</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Its deer all asleep in quiet trust, its birds tranquilly resting,--seeing it he too became restful, and he felt as if his end was attained.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. For the sake of ending his wonder and to show reverence for the penances observed, and as expressing his own conformity therewith[1], he alighted from the back of his horse.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Having alighted, he stroked the horse, exclaiming, 'All is saved,' and he spoke well-pleased to <I>Kh</I>a<I>m</I>daka, bedewing him as it were with tears from his eyes:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. 'Good friend, thy devotion to me and thy courage of soul have been proved by thy thus following this steed whose speed is like that of T&acirc;rkshya[2].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. 'Bent even though I am on other business, I am wholly won in heart by thee,--one who has such a love for his master, and at the same time is able to carry out his wish.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. 'One can be able without affection, and affectionate though unable; but one like thee, at once affectionate and able, is hard to find in the world.</P>

<P><SMALL>[1. Sv&acirc;<I>m</I> <I>k</I>&acirc;numarit&acirc;<I>m</I> rakshan. [The Tibetan has the obscure ran&middot;gi rjes&middot;su bsrun&middot;va la=sva+anu+rakshan? H.W.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. 'I am pleased with this noble action of thine; this feeling is seen towards me, even though I am regardless of conferring rewards.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. 'Who would not be favourably disposed to one who stands to him as bringing him reward? but even one's own people commonly become mere strangers in a reverse of fortune[1].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. 'The son is maintained for the sake of the family, the father is honoured for the sake of our own (future) support; the world shows kindness for the sake of hope; there is no such a thing as unselfishness without a motive.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. 'Why speak many words? in short, thou hast done me a very great kindness; take now my horse and return, I have attained the desired wood.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Thus having spoken, the mighty hero in his desire to show perfect gentleness[2] unloosed his ornaments and gave them to the other, who was deeply grieved.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Having taken a brilliant jewel whose effect illumined his diadem, he stood, uttering these words, like the mountain Ma<I>m</I>dara with the sun resting on it:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. 'By thee with this jewel, O <I>Kh</I>a<I>m</I>da, having offered him repeated obeisance, the king, with his loving confidence still unshaken, must be enjoined to stay his grief.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. '"I have entered the ascetic-wood to destroy old age and death,--with no thirst for heaven, with no lack of love nor feeling of anger.</P>

<P><SMALL>[1. <I>G</I>an&icirc;bhavati may be a quaint expression for para<I>g</I>ano bhavati,--this seems the meaning of the Tibetan. Or we might read <I>g</I>anyo bhavati.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. '"Do not think of mourning for me who am thus gone forth from my home; union, however long it may last, in time will come to an end.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. '"Since separation is certain, therefore is my mind fixed on liberation; how shall there not be repeated severings from one's kindred?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. '"Do not think of mourning for me who am gone forth to leave sorrow behind; it is the thralls of passion, who are attached to desires, the causes of sorrow, for whom thou shouldst mourn.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. '"This was the firm persuasion of our predecessors,--I as one departing by a common road am not to be mourned for by my heir.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. '"At a man's death there are doubtless heirs to his wealth; but heirs to his merit are hard to find on the earth or exist not at all.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. '"Even though thou sayest, 'He is gone at a wrong time to the wood,'--there is no wrong time for religious duty (dharma), life being fragile as it is.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. '"Therefore my determination is, 'I must seek my supreme good this very day;' what confidence can there be in life, when death stands as our adversary?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. 'Do thou address the king, O friend, with these and such-like words; and do thou use thy efforts so that he may not even remember me.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. 'Yea, do thou repeat to the king our utter unworthiness; through unworthiness affection is lost,--and where affection is lost, there is no sorrow.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. Having heard these words, <I>Kh</I>a<I>m</I>da, overwhelmed with grief, made reply with folded hands, his voice choked by tears:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. 'At this state of mind of thine, causing affliction</P>

<!----------------------p. 65---------------------->

<P><A NAME="p. 65">{p. 65}</A></P>

<P>to thy kindred, my mind, O my lord, sinks down like an elephant in the mud of a river.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. 'To whom would not such a determination as this of thine cause tears, even if his heart were of iron,--how much more if it were throbbing with love?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. 'Where[1] is this delicacy of limb, fit to lie only in a palace,--and where is the ground of the ascetic forest, covered with the shoots of rough ku<I>s</I>a grass?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. 'When, on hearing thy resolve, I first brought thee this horse,--it was fate only, O my lord, which made me do it, mastering my will.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. 'But how could I, O king, by mine own will, knowing this thy decision,--carry back the horse to the sorrow of Kapilavastu?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. 'Surely thou wilt not abandon, O hero, that fond old king, so devoted to his son, as a heretic might the true religion?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. 'And her, thy second mother, worn with the care of bringing thee up,--thou wilt not surely forget her, as an ingrate a benefit?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. 'Thou wilt not surely abandon thy queen, endowed with all virtues, illustrious for her family, devoted to her husband and with a young son, as a coward the royal dignity within his reach?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34 'Thou wilt not abandon the young son of Ya<I>s</I>odhar&acirc;, worthy of all praise, thou the best of the cherishers of religion and fame, as a dissolute spendthrift his choicest glory?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35, 'Or even if thy mind be resolved to abandon thy kindred and thy kingdom, thou wilt not, O master, abandon me,--thy feet are my only refuge.</P>

<P><SMALL>[1. A common expression (which occurs also in Persian poetry) to imply the incompatibility of two things.]</SMALL></P>

<!----------------------p. 66---------------------->

<P><A NAME="p. 66">{p. 66}</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. 'I cannot go to the city with my soul thus burning, leaving thee behind in the forest as Sumitra[1] left the son of Raghu.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37. 'What will the king say to me, returning to the city without thee? or what shall I say to thy queens by way of telling them good news?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38. 'As for what thou saidst, "thou must repeat my unworthiness to the king"--how shall I speak what is false of thee as of a sage without a fault?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39. 'Or even if I ventured to speak it with a heart ashamed and a tongue cleaving to my mouth, who would think of believing it?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40. 'He who would tell of or believe the fierceness of the moon, might tell of or believe thy faults, O physician of faults.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41. 'Him who is always compassionate and who never fails to feel pity, it ill befits to abandon one who loves;--turn back and have mercy on me.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. Having heard these words of <I>Kh</I>a<I>m</I>da overcome with sorrow,--self-possessed with the utmost firmness the best of speakers answered:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43. 'Abandon this distress, <I>Kh</I>a<I>m</I>da, regarding thy separation from me,--change is inevitable in corporeal beings who are subject to different births.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44. 'Even if I through affection were not to abandon my kindred in my desire for liberation, death would still make us helplessly abandon one another.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45. 'She, my mother, by whom I was borne in the womb with great thirst and pains,--where am I now with regard to her, all her efforts fruitless, and where is she with regard to me?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46. 'As birds go to their roosting-tree and then</P>

<P><SMALL>[1. This is the Sumantra of the R&acirc;m&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a II, 57.]</SMALL></P>

<!----------------------p. 67---------------------->

<P><A NAME="p. 67">{p. 67}</A></P>

<P>depart, so the meeting of beings inevitably ends in separation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47. 'As clouds, having come together, depart asunder again, such I consider the meeting and parting of living things.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. 'And since this world goes away, each one of us deceiving the other,--it is not right to think anything thine own in a time of union which is a dream.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. 'Since the trees are parted from the innate colour of their leaves, why should there not still more be the parting of two things which are alien to each other?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50. 'Therefore, since it is so, grieve not, my good friend, but go; or if thy love lingers, then go and afterwards return.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. 'Say, without reproaching us, to the people in Kapilavastu, "Let your love for him be given up, and hear his resolve.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. '"Either he will quickly come back, having destroyed old age and death; or else he will himself perish, having failed in his purpose and lost hold of every support."'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. Having heard his words, Ka<I>m</I>thaka, the noblest of steeds, licked his feet with his tongue and dropped hot tears.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. With his hand whose fingers were united with a membrane and which was marked with the auspicious svastika, and with its middle part curved[1], the prince stroked him and addressed him like a friend:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. 'Shed not tears, Ka<I>m</I>thaka, this thy perfect</P>

<P><SMALL>[1. Professor Kielhorn suggests kakra-madhyena, 'with a wheel in its centre,' cf. VIII, 55.]</SMALL></P>

<!----------------------p. 68---------------------->

<P><A NAME="p. 68">{p. 68}</A></P>

<P>equine nature has been proved,--bear with it, this thy labour will soon have its fruit.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. Then seizing the sharp jewelled sword which was in <I>Kh</I>a<I>m</I>daka's hand, he resolutely drew out from the sheath the blade decked with golden ornaments, like a serpent from its hole.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. Having drawn it forth, dark blue like a blue lotus petal, he cut his decorated tiara and his hair, and he tossed it with its scattered muslin into the air as a grey goose into a lake.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. And the heavenly beings, with a longing to worship it, seized it respectfully as it was thrown up; and the divine hosts paid it due adoration in heaven with celestial honours.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. Having thus divorced his ornaments and banished all royal magnificence from his head, and seeing his muslin floating away like a golden goose, the stedfast prince desired a sylvan dress.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. Then a celestial being, wearing the form of a hunter, pure in heart, knowing his thoughts, approached near him in dark-red garments; and the son of the <I>S</I>&acirc;kya king thus addressed him:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. 'Thy red garments are auspicious, the sign of a saint; but this destructive bow is not befitting; therefore, my good friend, if there is no strong preference in the matter, do thou give me that dress and take this of mine.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. The hunter replied, 'It has given me my desire[1], O giver of desires, as by this I have inspired</P>

<P><SMALL>[1. I have taken &acirc;r&acirc;t as from &acirc; + r&acirc; but Professor Kielhorn suggests that it might mean 'near.' 'Although in this dress I make the deer come confidently close to me and then kill them, yet take it if you want it.' [The Tibetan seems to have read k&acirc;mas&acirc;r&acirc;t--<SUB>&deg;</SUB>dod&middot;pa s&ntilde;in&middot;po las, 'from essence of desire.']]</SMALL></P>

<!----------------------p. 69---------------------->

<P><A NAME="p. 69">{p. 69}</A></P>

<P>animals with confidence and then killed them; but if thou hast need of it, O thou who art like Indra, accept it at once and give me the white dress.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. With extreme joy he then took that sylvan dress and gave away the linen one; and the hunter, assuming his heavenly form, having taken the white garment, went to heaven.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. Then the prince and the attendant of the horse were filled with wonder as he was thus going, and forthwith they paid great honour anew to that sylvan dress.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. Then the great-souled one, having dismissed the weeping <I>Kh</I>a<I>m</I>da, and wearing his fame veiled by the sign of the red garment, went towards the hermitage, like the king of mountains wrapped in an evening cloud.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. While his master, thus regardless of his kingdom, was going to the ascetic-wood in mean garments, the groom, tossing up his arms, wailed bitterly and fell on the ground.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. Having looked again he wept aloud, and embraced the horse Ka<I>m</I>thaka with his arms; and then, hopeless and repeatedly lamenting, he went in body to the city, not in soul.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. Sometimes he pondered, sometimes he lamented, sometimes he stumbled, and sometimes he fell; and so going along, wretched through his devoted attachment, he performed all kinds of actions in the road without conscious will.</P>
