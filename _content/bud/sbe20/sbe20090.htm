<p>1. Now the venerable Up&acirc;li&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_855"></A><A HREF="#fn_841"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> went up to the Blessed One, and bowed down before him, and took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated, the venerable Up&acirc;li said to the Blessed One:</p>  
<p>'When a Bhikkhu, Lord, intends to take upon himself the conduct (of any matter that has to be</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_314"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 314</FONT></A></p>  
<p>decided)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_856"></A><A HREF="#fn_842"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, under what conditions should he take the conduct thereof upon himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_857"></A><A HREF="#fn_843"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?'</p>  
<p>'A Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, who intends to take upon himself the conduct of any matter, should take such conduct upon himself under five conditions.</p>  
<p>'(In the first place.) A Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, who intends to take the conduct of any matter upon himself, should thus consider: "The conduct of this matter which I intend to take upon myself; is it now the right time for the taking charge of the conduct thereof, or is it not?" If that Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, so considering, come to the conclusion that it is not the right time, he should not, Up&acirc;li, take charge of it.</p>  
<p>'(Secondly.) If that Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, so considering, come to the conclusion that it is the right time, he should, Up&acirc;li, further consider thus: "The conduct of this matter which I intend to take upon myself, is it just, or is it not?" If that Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, so considering, come to the conclusion that it would not be just, he should not take charge of it.</p>  
<p>'(Thirdly.) If that Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, so considering, come to the conclusion that it would be just, he should, Up&acirc;li, further consider thus: "The conduct of this matter which I intend to take upon myself; would it tend to advantage, or would it not?" If that Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, so considering, come to the conclusion that it would not tend to advantage, he should not, Up&acirc;li, take charge of it.</p>  
<p>'(Fourthly.) If that Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, so considering, come to the conclusion that it would tend to</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_315"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 315</FONT></A></p>  
<p>profit, he should, Up&acirc;li, further consider thus: "While I am taking the conduct of this matter upon myself, shall I find that the Bhikkhus who are my intimates and associates are on my side in accordance with the Dhamma and the Vinaya, or shall I not?" If that Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, so considering, come to the conclusion that he will not, he should not, Up&acirc;li, take charge of it.</p>  
<p>(Fifthly.) If that Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, so considering, come to the conclusion that he will find them so, he should further, Up&acirc;li, consider thus: "Whilst I am taking the conduct of this matter upon myself, will the Sa<I>m</I>gha, as a result thereof, fall into strife, quarrel, contention, or dispute, or will there arise a split in the Sa<I>m</I>gha, disunion in the Sa<I>m</I>gha, diversity of position in the Sa<I>m</I>gha, diversity of action in the Sa<I>m</I>gha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_858"></A><A HREF="#fn_844"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?" If that Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, so considering, come to the conclusion that that will happen, he should not take charge of it. But if that Bhikkhu, Up&acirc;li, thus considering, should come to the conclusion that that will not happen, he should take charge of it. The taking charge of a matter, Up&acirc;li, subject to these five conditions, will not give cause to subsequent remorse.'</p>
