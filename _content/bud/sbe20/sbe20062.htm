<p>1. Now at that time it had been settled that a certain high official at court, a follower of the &Acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;vakas, should provide the day's meal for the Sa<I>m</I>gha. And the venerable Upananda the S&acirc;kyan, coming late, but before the meal was over, made the Bhikkhu next (junior to him in seniority&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>) get</p>

<p>up out of his seat; and the dining-hall was thrown into confusion.</p>  
<p>Then that minister became indignant, murmured, and was annoyed: 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<I>n</I>as behave so! Is it not then lawful for any one, unless he have been seated, to eat as much as he requires?'</p>  
<p>And the Bhikkhus heard him murmuring, &amp;c. And they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Is it true as they say, &amp;c.?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One rebuked him, &amp;c., and he said to the Bhikkhus, 'A Bhikkhu is not, O Bhikkhus, to be made to get up out of his seat before the meal is over. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. And if any one causes another to get up, and be then invited to partake of the meal, he shall be ordered to go and fetch water. If he shall thus receive the place, it is well; if not, the other one shall first complete his swallowing of the rice, and shall then give up the place to his senior. But in no case, O Bhikkhus, do I say that a place properly belonging to a senior Bhikkhu is to be taken (by a junior). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus made sick Bhikkhus get up (from their seats). The sick men said, 'We cannot, Sirs, get up; for we are sick.'</p>  
<p>'We insist upon your getting up,' said they; and</p>

<p>seizing them, and pulling them up, they let them go as they were standing. The sick men, as soon as they were let go, fell down.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'A sick man, O Bhikkhus, is not to be made to get up. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, saying, 'We are sick, and cannot be turned out,' took possession of the best sleeping-places.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I enjoin, O Bhikkhus, that you allot to sick Bhikkhus suitable sleeping-places.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, on pretext of some slight indisposition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, took exclusive possession of sleeping-places.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to do so. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>
