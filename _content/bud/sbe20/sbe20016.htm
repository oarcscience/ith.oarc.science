<p>1. Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha, in the Bamboo Grove, in the Kalandaka Niv&acirc;pa. And at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, when bathing, used to rub&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> their bodies--thighs, and arms, and breast, and back--against wood. The people were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<I>n</I>as do so, like wrestlers, boxers, or shampooers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?' The Bhikkhus heard the people so murmuring, &amp;c.; and they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, having convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha, asked the Bhikkhus: 'Is this true, O Bhikkhus, what they say, that the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, when bathing, rub (&amp;c., as before)?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>

<p>The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'This is improper, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as usual, see I, 1, 2, down to the end).' And when he had rebuked them, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'A Bhikkhu, when bathing, is not, O Bhikkhus, to rub his body against wood. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus: when bathing, used to rub their bodies--thighs, and arms, and breast, and back--against a pillar--against a wall (&amp;c., as in last section, down to the end).</p>  
<p>3. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to bathe on an A<I>t</I><I>t</I>&acirc;na (a sort of shampooing stand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>). The people (&amp;c., as before). The Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before). Then the Blessed One (&amp;c., as before, down to) addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'You are not to bathe, O Bhikkhus, on an A<I>t</I><I>t</I>&acirc;na. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_120"></A><A HREF="sbe20016.htm#fr_123">66:1</A> Uggha<I>m</I>seti. The simple verb occurs below, V, 9, 2, 4, X, 10, 2, and at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka, vol. i, p. 190. It is the Sanskrit root gharsh.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_121"></A><A HREF="sbe20016.htm#fr_124">66:2</A> On malla-mu<I>t</I><I>th</I>ik&acirc; Buddhaghosa merely says mu<I>t</I><I>th</I>ika-mall&acirc;. His note on g&acirc;ma-poddav&acirc; (already given by H.O. at p. 3.15 of the edition to the text) says, 'town&#8217;s people given to adorning themselves by painting their skin' (on which compare below, V, 2, 5). But it is difficult to see how that fits in with the connection here.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_122"></A><A HREF="sbe20016.htm#fr_125">67:1</A> So Buddhaghosa loc. cit.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_123"></A><A HREF="sbe20016.htm#fr_126">67:2</A> A wooden instrument in the shape of a hand, which was firs; covered with chunam (fine lime), and then rubbed over the body. See Buddhaghosa's note at p. 315 of H.O.'s edition of the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_124"></A><A HREF="sbe20016.htm#fr_127">67:3</A> Apparently a string of beads which was first covered with the chunam made from Kuruvindaka stone (a ruby-coloured stone), and then held at both ends and rubbed over the body. See Buddhaghosa's note loc. cit.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_125"></A><A HREF="sbe20016.htm#fr_128">67:4</A> As Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., explains this by 'rubbing their <A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A> bodies up against each other'(!), vigayha has here probably nothing to do with g&acirc;h, but is simply vig<I>ri</I>hya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_126"></A><A HREF="sbe20016.htm#fr_130">68:1</A> A kind of back-scratcher, made according to Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., by placing together, by the roots, hooks made of the teeth of crocodiles (makara-dantaka; see V, 11, 6; VI, 3, 2), which had previously been split. Such hooks of split crocodiles' teeth are mentioned in the text itself below, V, 9, 2; and pins or hooks made of raga's teeth at V, 9, 5, and VI, 3, 5 (n&acirc;ga-dantaka), and V, It, 7 (n&acirc;ga-danta).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_127"></A><A HREF="sbe20016.htm#fr_131">68:2</A> Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., makes this phrase mean only 'made of teeth that had not been previously split.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_128"></A><A HREF="sbe20016.htm#fr_132">68:3</A> Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., explains this word by vattova<I>t</I><I>t</I>i; which is to us equally unintelligible.</P>
