### 2.

1\. The single Bhikkhu who speaks not in accordance with the right, the
many who speak not in accordance with the right, the Sa*m*gha which
speaks not in accordance with the right. The single Bhikkhu who speaks
in accordance with the right, the many who speak in accordance with the
right, the Sa*m*gha which speaks in accordance with the right <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_1)

Now (it may happen that) the one Bhikkhu who speaks not in accordance
with the right may point out (the right course) to a single Bhikkhu who
speaks in accordance with the right, or gives him to understand what it
is <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_2), or urges him to see or consider
the matter in that light <span id="fr_4"></span>[3](#fn_3), or teaches
him, or

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

instructs him, saying, 'This is the Dhamma, this the Vinaya, this the
teaching of the Master. Accept this, and approve this.' If the dispute
should be thus settled, it is settled contrary to the Dhamma, and with a
mere counterfeit of the Vinaya rule of procedure (that cases of dispute
must be settled before a duly constituted meeting of the Sa*m*gha, and
in the presence of the accused person) <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_4).

\[And in like manner, if he instruct the many, or the Sa*m*gha, who
speak according to the right;--or if the many or the Sa*m*gha who speak
not according to the right instruct the one, or the many, or the
Sa*m*gha who speak according to the right;-then the dispute is settled
contrary to the Dhamma (&c., as before).\]

End of the nine cases in which the wrong side decides.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[2:1](sbe20003.htm#fr_2) This short enumeration
of the different categories occurring in the subsequent paragraphs is
quite in the style of the Abhidhamma texts, in which such lists are
accustomed to be called mâtikâ; compare the expression mâtikâ-dharo as
applied to a learned Bhikkhu in the stock phrase at Mahâvagga X, 2, 1;
*K*ullavagga I, 11; IV, 14, 25, &c.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[2:2](sbe20003.htm#fr_3) The Samanta Pâsâdikâ
here says: ni*ggh*âpetîti yathâ so ta*m* attha*m* ni*ggh*âyati oloketi
eva*m* karoti.

Sammukhâ-vinaya-pa*t*irûpakena. The rule of procedure, called
Sammukhâ-vinaya, hereafter rendered 'Proceeding in Presence,' is one of
the seven modes of settling disputes already. referred to in the closing
chapter of the Pâtimokkha ('Vinaya Texts,' vol. 1, p. 68), and is more
fully described below in *K*ullavagga IV, 14, 16, and following
sections.

It will be seen below, from §§ IV, 14, 27-30, that it is involved in, or
rather is supposed to accompany, each of the other Proceedings mentioned
in this chapter.
