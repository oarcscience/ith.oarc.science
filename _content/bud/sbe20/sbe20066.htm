<P><A NAME="fn_587"></A><A HREF="sbe20066.htm#fr_597">208:2</A> On the meaning of paribhoga here compare VI, 18, 1. The doubt here expressed is curious, as a storeyed building (p&acirc;s&acirc;da) is one of the five kinds of abodes (len&acirc;ni) specially sanctioned by Mah&acirc;vagga I, 30, 4, and <I>K</I>ullavagga VI, 1, 2; and a verandah (&acirc;linda) has been also authorised by <I>K</I>ullavagga VI, 3, 5. No doubt the special point here is as to the carved pillars: but, even so, that this rule should be thus separated from the other rules as to buildings, in the commencement of this book (VI, 1-4), is a proof of the unsystematic way in which the Khandhakas have been put together. Even the final redaction which we have now before us contains much similar evidence of the gradual growth of these rules. See note 3 on the next paragraph.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_588"></A><A HREF="sbe20066.htm#fr_598">209:1</A> Compare the 87th P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_589"></A><A HREF="sbe20066.htm#fr_599">209:2</A> This rule has already been given in VI, 2, 6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_590"></A><A HREF="sbe20066.htm#fr_600">209:3</A> It is distinctly laid down without any reservation in Mah&acirc;vagga V, 10, 5 (in the paragraph erroneously numbered V, 10, 4 in vol. ii, p. 28, of the present work), that the use of any of these things is a dukka<I>t</I>a offence. That this relaxation of that rule should be inserted only here, looks very much like an after-thought, even though the former passage merely refers to the use of these things as seats. This is more. especially noteworthy from the fact mentioned in the last note.</p>  
<p>The rules as to new rugs or mats to be used for sitting upon, are contained in the 11th to the 15th Nissaggiya P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiyas.</P>
