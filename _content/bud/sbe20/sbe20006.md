### 5 <span id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_33)

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhu Gagga was insane and out of his mind;
and by him, when so insane and out of his mind, many things unworthy of
a sama*n*a had been committed, as well in speech as in act <span
id="fr_35"></span>[3](#fn_34). The Bhikkhus warned the Bhikkhu Gagga of
a fault so committed by him when insane and out of his mind, saying,
'Does the venerable one call to

mind that he has committed such and such an offence?'

He replied, 'I, my friends, was insane and out of my mind. (No doubt)
many things unworthy of a sama*n*a, as well in speech as in act, may
have been committed by me when so insane and out of my mind. But I do
not recollect it. It was done by me by reason of my insanity.'

But though they received that answer from him <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_35), they warned him still, saying, 'Does the
venerable one call to mind that he has committed such and such an
offence?'

'Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed, murmured, and became
indignant, saying, "How can those Bhikkhus warn the Bhikkhu Gagga . . .
saying . . . such and such an offence?" And when he replies, "I, my
friends, was insane . . . by reason of my insanity"--how can those
Bhikkhus still warn him, saying . . . of such and such an offence?'

And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.

'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that those Bhikkhus (&c., as before, down to)
such and such an offence?'

'It is true, Lord.'

Then he rebuked them, and when he had delivered a religious discourse he
addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

'Let then the Sa*m*gha grant to Gagga the

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhikkhu who is now
sane the dispensation for those who are no longer insane.

2\. 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be granted.

'Let that Bhikkhu Gagga \[here follow the words of the formal request,
of the resolution, and of the grant by decision of the Sa*m*gha, exactly
in the same way as in the last case, chapter 4, § 10\].'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_33"></span>[18:2](sbe20006.htm#fr_34) The particular
decision given in this chapter for the particular case is elaborated in
chap. 14, § 28 below into a general rule for every similar case.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[18:3](sbe20006.htm#fr_35) Buddhaghosa explains
this word as follows: 'Bhâsitaparikantan ti vi*k*âya bhâsita*m* kâyena
parikkanta*m* parikkametvâ katan ti attho.' The similar word
Parikanta*m*, which occurs in the Sutta-vibhaṅga, Pârâ*g*ika IV, 1, 2,
in the sense of lacerated, is from the root k*ri*nt.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[19:1](sbe20006.htm#fr_36) Na*m* in the text is
correct. It is identical with the *n*a*m* so frequently found in Jain
Prakrit; on which see Weber in his Bhagavatî 'Abhandlungen der Berliner
Akadamie,' 1865, pp. 422 and foll.
