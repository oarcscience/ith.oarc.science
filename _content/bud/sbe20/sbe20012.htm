<p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the Bhikkhu Uv&acirc;<I>l</I>a do so?' And they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say that the Bhikkhu [&amp;c., as before].'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
<p>Then he rebuked him, and when he had delivered a religious discourse he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
<p>'Then, O Bhikkhus, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha carry out the Tassa-p&acirc;piyyasik&acirc;-kamma (the Proceeding in the case of the obstinately wrong)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>

<p>offence (namely, of obstinacy or prevarication); when he has brought upon himself this new offence, some discreet and able Bhikkhu ought to lay the matter before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, saying,</p>  
<p>'"Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear the. This Bhikkhu Uv&acirc;<I>l</I>a, being examined in the midst of the Sa<I>m</I>gha with an offence, when he has denied it then confesses it, when he has confessed it then denies it, makes counter-charges, and speaks lies which he knows to be such.

<P><A NAME="fn_55"></A><A HREF="sbe20012.htm#fr_56">28:2</A> Chapter 14, section 29 below, is in fact an elaboration of this paragraph, giving instances of the kind of prevarication here intended to be referred to.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_56"></A><A HREF="sbe20012.htm#fr_57">28:3</A> The exact meaning of the phrase is somewhat doubtful, owing to the ambiguity of the tassa. It should probably be analysed 'the proceeding against one who is more sinful (p&acirc;piyo) than that (tassa);' that is, who adds sin to sin. Childers gives a long note on the Proceeding drawn by Wijesi<I>m</I>ha Mudaliyar from this chapter, but does not analyse the word.</P>
