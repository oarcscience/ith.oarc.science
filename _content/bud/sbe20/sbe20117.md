1\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhunî first abandoned the precepts,
and then threw off the robes <span id="fr_956"></span>[1](#fn_940).
Afterwards she came back, and asked the Bhikkhunîs to admit her into the
Order again.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî ought not, O Bhikkhus, to abandon the precepts. But by
having thrown off the robes she is ipso facto incapable of being a
Bhikkhunî.'

2\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhunî, though still wearing the
orange-coloured robe, joined a sect of the Titthiyas. Afterwards she
came back, and asked the Bhikkhunîs to receive her into the Order again.

They told this matter to the Blessed One. .

'A Bhikkhunî, O Bhikkhus, who, when still wearing the orange-coloured
robe, has gone over to the Titthiyas, is not to be received again <span
id="fr_957"></span>[2](#fn_941).'
