<p>1. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu tied his bowl with a string, and suspending it on a staff&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, went after noon out of a certain village gate. The people calling out, 'There goes a thief; his sword is glistening,' fell upon him, and seized him. But on recognising him, they let him go. That Bhikkhu, returning to the &Acirc;r&acirc;ma, told this matter to the Bhikkhus.</p>  
<p>'What then, Sir,. did you carry a staff with a string to it?'</p>  
<p>'It is even so, Sirs.'</p>  
<p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate murmured (&amp;c., as usual, see I, 1, 2, 3) . . . . told the Blessed One . . . . he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to carry a staff with a string to it. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>

<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give to a sick Bhikkhu the permission (license) to use a staff. And thus, O Bhikkhus, should it be given. That sick Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, should go up to the Sa<I>m</I>gha [here follow the words of a Kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;, precisely as in V, 20, 7]'</p>  
<p>3. [Similar paragraphs ending with Kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;s for license to lift the bowl with a string, and with both a staff and a string.]</p>
