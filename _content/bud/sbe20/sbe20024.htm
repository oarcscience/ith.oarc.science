<p>1. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to use bowls of various kinds, made of gold and silver.</p>  
<p>The people murmured (&amp;c., as usual, down to) They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use bowls made</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of gold, or made of silver, or set with jewels, or made of beryl (ve<I>l</I>uriya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), or made of crystal, or made of copper, or made of glass&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, or made of tin, or made of lead, or made of bronze. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, bowls of two kinds,--those made of iron, and those made of clay.'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time the support at the bottom of the bowls wore out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use circular (pieces of metal) as the supports for your bowls.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to have various kinds of circular supports to their bowls.--silver ones, and gold ones.</p>  
<p>The people murmured (&amp;c., down to) They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have various kinds of circular supports to your bowls. Whosoever does</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A></p>  
<p>so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, two kinds of circular supports to your bowls,--tin ones, and lead ones.'</p>  
<p>The thick circular supports could not be inserted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to shape them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (until they get to be the right size to fit in)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>They would not stay in (?)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to split little pieces of crocodiles' teeth (to fit them in with)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus had painted circular linings to the bottoms of their bowls, with painted figures scattered over them, or painted in patches of colour&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and they used to walk about the streets exhibiting them.</p>  
<p>People murmured (&amp;c., down to) They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have painted circular supports to the bottoms of your bowls, covered</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with figures, and painted in patches of colour. Whosoever shall do so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, only ordinary linings.'</p>  
<p>3. Now at that time the Bhikkhus put away their bowls with water in them, and the bowls were split.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put away your bowls with water in them. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, to dry your bowls in the sunshine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> before putting them away.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus dried their bowls in the sunshine, with water in them; and the bowls became evil-smelling.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to dry your bowls in the sunshine with water in them. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus; to empty out the water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and then warm the bowls, before you put them away.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls away in a warm place; and the colour of the bowls was spoilt.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls away in a warm place. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to dry your bowls for a short time in a warm place, and then to put them away.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. Now at that time a number of bowls were left in the open air without supports; and the bowls were turned over by a whirlwind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and broke.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of supports for your bowls (when they are left out).'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls away at the edge of the sleeping-benches in the verandahs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and the bowls fell down and were broken.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls away on the edge of the sleeping-benches in the verandah. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls away on the edge of the Paribha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and the bowls fell down and were broken.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls away on the edge of the Paribha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus turned their bowls upside down&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> on the ground, and the lips wore out.</p>

<p><A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A></p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a mat made of grass&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>The grass-mat was eaten by white ants.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a small cloth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>The small cloth was eaten by the white ants. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a raised parapet (?) (on which to put your bowls)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>The bowls fell down from the parapet and were broken.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow your O Bhikkhus, the use of a wicker-work stand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>On the wicker-work stand the bowls wore out. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of bags to carry your bowls in.'</p>  
<p>They had no shoulder-straps&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a shoulder-strap (by which to carry the bag), or of a piece of string (by which to tie it on).'</p>  
<p>5. Now at that time the Bhikkhus hung up their bowls on pins in the walls, or on hooks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The pins or hooks falling down, the bowls were broken.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to hang your bowls up. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls down on a bed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, or a chair; and sitting down thoughtlessly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> they upset them, and the bowls were broken.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls on the bed, or on a chair. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus kept their bowls on their laps; and rising up thoughtlessly they upset them, and the bowls were broken.</p>

<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to keep your bowls on your laps. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus put their bowls down on a sunshade; and the sunshade being lifted up by a whirlwind, the bowls rolled over, and were broken.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to put your bowls down on a sunshade. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when they were holding the bowls in their hands, opened the door&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The door springing back the bowls were broken.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to open the door with your bowls in your hands. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_164"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_169">82:1</A> It is clear from verses 192-196 of the 13th chapter of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>a-nigha<I>n</I><I>t</I>u, written by Narahari of Kashm&icirc;r in the thirteenth century A. D., that at that time Vai<I>d</I>&ucirc;rya meant 'cat's-eye: But it is uncertain whether that was the only meaning of the word ve<I>l</I>uriya at the time when this passage was composed. (See especially V. 124, p. 25, of Dr. Richard Garbe's edition in his work, 'Die Indischen Mineralien,' Leipzig, 1882.) See also Professor Max M&uuml;ller's interesting note at p. 266 of his 'What can India teach us?'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_165"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_170">82:2</A> K&acirc;<I>k</I>amayo. There was probably no glass in our modern sense of the word when the <I>K</I>ullavagga was written. But k&acirc;<I>k</I>a is a silicious earth, and some sort of glass-like earthenware may very well have been in use. The phrase has already occurred, together with all the others in this passage, at Mah&acirc;vagga V, 8, 3, of foot-coverings, but is omitted in the list at Khudda Sikkh&acirc; V. 10.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_166"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_171">82:3</A> Gha<I>m</I>s&icirc;yati. Literally, 'were rubbed.' See below, &sect; 3, and our note below on V, 9, 2, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_167"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_172">83:1</A> A<I>k</I><I>kh</I>&ucirc;piyanti. On the use of this word, compare Mah&acirc;vagga VIII, 14, 1, where it is used of inserting a slip of cloth in a torn garment.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_168"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_173">83:2</A> See our note above on V, 8, I. Buddhaghosa says here likhitun ti tanu-kara<I>n</I>-atth&acirc;y&#8217; eta<I>m</I> vutta<I>m</I>. The 'shaping' may be by carving, adzing, or planing.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_169"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_174">83:3</A> Compare above, V, 8, 1, and see Buddhaghosa's note at p. 316 of the edition of the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_170"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_175">83:4</A> The reading is corrupt; and therefore this rendering is merely conjectural. See H.O.'s note at p. 316 of his edition of the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_171"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_176">83:5</A> On these split crocodiles' teeth, see our note above on V, 1, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_172"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_177">83:6</A> R&ucirc;pakoki<I>n</I><I>n</I>&acirc;ni bhati-kamma-kat&acirc;ni. Buddhaghosa has nothing on these words. On the second, see below, VI, 2, 7, and H.O.'s note on that passage at p. 321 of the edition of the text. It is most probable that the reading in both passages should be bhatti-kamma, 'patchwork,' as further explained in our note below on VI, 2, 7; and we have translated accordingly.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_173"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_178">84:1</A> Ot&acirc;petv&acirc;. The word has already occurred in Mah&acirc;vagga I, 25, 16. Compare Khudda Sikkh&acirc; V. 6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_174"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_179">84:2</A> Vodaka<I>m</I> katv&acirc;. Vodaka<I>m</I> bears, of course, the same relation to sa-udaka<I>m</I>, used just before, as vagga does to samagga. The expression has occurred already at Mah&acirc;vagga I, 25, 13.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_175"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_180">85:1</A> V&acirc;ta-ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>alik&acirc;ya. So also in the next section and in the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya 96. The reading at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka I, 72 is v&acirc;ta-ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala<I>m</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_176"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_181">85:2</A> Mi<I>dh</I>ante. This word recurs below in VI, 2, 3, where see our note. Buddhaghosa's note is given at p. 317 of the edition of the text. See also Khudda Sikkh&acirc; V. 7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_177"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_182">85:3</A> Used of a house, this probably means a plastered flooring of scented earth or dried cowdung. See <I>K</I>ullavagga VI, 17, 1, and Buddhaghosa's note there. On the use of the word in tailoring, see Mah&acirc;vagga VII, 1, 5, VIII, 21. Buddhaghosa, loc. cit. (p. 3 i 7), uses the expression mattika-paribha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a-kat&acirc;ya-bh&ucirc;miy&acirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_178"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_183">85:4</A> Nikku<I>g</I><I>g</I>anti. See the use of this word at V, 20, 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_179"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_184">86:1</A> Ti<I>n</I>a-santh&acirc;raka<I>m</I>. That this word means a mat, and not a layer, of grass is clear from its use at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka I, 360, and below, V, II, 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_180"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_185">86:2</A> <I>K</I>olaka. The meaning of the word is doubtful, but see Mah&acirc;vagga VIII, 18. In the udd&acirc;na (at p. 143) the corresponding word is <I>k</I>ola. See also below, VI, 3, I, VI, 19, VI, 20, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_181"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_186">86:3</A> Patta-m&acirc;laka<I>m</I>. Buddhaghosa says merely, 'It should be made either of bricks or of wood.' He confirms the reading of the text (with <I>l</I> as against Childers's reading m&acirc;lako).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_182"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_187">86:4</A> Patta-ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>olik&acirc; ti mah&acirc;-mukha-ku<I>n</I><I>d</I>a-sa<I>n</I><I>th</I>&acirc;n&acirc; bhandakukkha<I>li</I>kn&acirc; vu<I>k</I><I>k</I>ati (B.). Ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>ola is a wicker-work basket; see B&ouml;htlingk-Roth, sub voce.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_183"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_188">86:5</A> See H.O.'s note on the reading here; and compare the table of contents to this chapter (at p. 143), where the reading a<I>m</I>sabaddha<I>m</I> confirms the suggested alteration. If there were any <A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A> further doubt it would be removed on comparing the closing words of Mah&acirc;vagga VI, 12, 4, which are identical with the present passage and contain the correct reading. The same remarks apply to other passages, where the same words occur below, V, It, 5, V, 12, VI, 12, 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_184"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_189">87:1</A> The use of these appliances is formally allowed at VI, 3, 5.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_185"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_190">87:2</A> Ma<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a. Compare Rh. D.'s note at p. 277 of the 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' and Khuddha Sikkh&acirc; V. 7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_186"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_191">87:3</A> Sati-sammos&acirc;. The word occurs at Milinda-pa<I>n</I>ha (ed. Trenckner), p. 260. It must be connected with mu<I>t</I><I>th</I>a-sati, of which the Buddhist Sanskrit equivalent is mushita-sm<I>ri</I>ti<I>h</I> (see Kath&acirc; Sarit S&acirc;gara 56, 289). It is evident that Childers's original explanation of mu<I>t</I><I>th</I>a-sati from m&ucirc;<I>lh</I>a was wrong, and that both words must be referred to the root mush, as he points out at p. .618 of his Dictionary.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_187"></A><A HREF="sbe20024.htm#fr_192">88:1</A> Kav&acirc;ta<I>m</I> pa<I>n</I>&acirc;metv&acirc;. The construction of doors is described in detail at V, 14, 3, with reference to the bath-house, and again at VI, 2. That pa<I>n</I>&acirc;meti is to open, and not to shut, is clear from VIII, 1, 1, just as patta<I>m</I> pa<I>n</I>&acirc;meti at VIII, 5, 2 is to uncover, disclose, the bowl. Compare Khuddha Sikkh&acirc; V. 8.</P>
