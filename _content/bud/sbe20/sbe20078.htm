<p>1. Now the venerable Up&acirc;li went up to the Blessed One, and bowed down before him, and took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated, the venerable Up&acirc;li said to the Blessed One: 'The expressions, Lord, "disunion in the Sa<I>m</I>gha," and "schism in the Sa<I>m</I>gha," are used&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_745"></A><A HREF="#fn_731"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. How much, Lord, goes to make disunion and not schism in the Sa<I>m</I>gha, and how much goes to make both disunion and schism in the Sa<I>m</I>gha?'</p>  
<p>'If one is on one side, Up&acirc;li, and two on the other side, and a fourth makes a formal proposition, and gives them voting-tickets, saying, "This is according to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the teaching of the Master. Take this (ticket) and give your sanction to this (opinion)"--then this, Up&acirc;li, is disunion in the Sa<I>m</I>gha, and not schism.</p>  
<p>If, Up&acirc;li, two are on one side, and other two are on the other side, and a fifth . . . . (and so on up to) and an eighth tell them something (&amp;c., as before)--then this, Up&acirc;li, is disunion in the Sa<I>m</I>gha, and not schism.</p>  
<p>'If, Up&acirc;li, four are on one side, and other four</p>

<p><A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A></p>  
<p>are on the other side, and a ninth tell them (&amp;c., as before)--then this, Up&acirc;li, is both disunion in the Sa<I>m</I>gha, and it is schism&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_746"></A><A HREF="#fn_732"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>(A separation) of nine, Up&acirc;li, or of more than nine, is both disunion in the Sa<I>m</I>gha, and it is schism.</p>  
<p>'A Bhikkhun&icirc;, Up&acirc;li, cannot make (one of the requisite number to cause) a schism, though she may help to produce a schism--nor a woman novice, nor a S&acirc;ma<I>n</I>era, male or female, nor a layman, nor a laywoman. It is only a Bhikkhu who is in full possession of all his privileges, and belongs to the same communion, and is domiciled in the same district&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_747"></A><A HREF="#fn_733"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who can make (one of the number requisite to form) a schism.'</p>  
<p>2. 'There is the expression, Lord, "schism in the Sa<I>m</I>gha." How much, Lord, does it require to constitute a schism in the Sa<I>m</I>gha?'</p>  
<p>'They put forth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_748"></A><A HREF="#fn_734"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, Up&acirc;li, what is not Dhamma as Dhamma (1), or what is Dhamma as not Dhamma (2), or what is not Vinaya as Vinaya (3), or what is Vinaya as not Vinaya (4), or what has not been taught and spoken by the Tath&acirc;gata as taught and spoken by him (5), or what has been taught and spoken by the Tath&acirc;gata as not taught</p>

<p>and spoken by him (6), or what has not been practised by the Tath&acirc;gata as practised by him (7), or what has been practised by the Tath&acirc;gata as not practised by him (8), or what has not been ordained by the Tath&acirc;gata as ordained by him (9), or what has been ordained by the Tath&acirc;gata as not ordained by him (10), or what is no offence as an offence (11), or what is an offence as no offence (12), or what is a slight offence to be a grievous offence (13), or what is a grievous offence to be a slight offence (14), or what is (a rule regarding) an offence to which there is an atonement as without atonement (15), or what is (a rule regarding) an offence to which there is no atonement as admitting of atonement (16), or what is a grave offence as not .a grave offence (17), or what is not a grave offence as a grave offence (18). In these Eighteen Points they hinder and mislead (their followers)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_749"></A><A HREF="#fn_735"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and perform independently Uposatha, and Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc;, and (official) acts of the Sa<I>m</I>gha. So much, Up&acirc;li, does it require to constitute a schism in the Sa<I>m</I>gha.'</p>  
<p>3. 'There is the expression, Lord, "concord in the Sa<I>m</I>gha." What, Lord, does it require to constitute concord in the Sa<I>m</I>gha?'</p>  
<p>'They put forth, Up&acirc;li, what is not Dhamma as not Dhamma (and so on through the Eighteen Points down to the end).</p>

<p>He who delights in party (strife), and adheres not to the Dhamma, is cut off from Arahatship:</p>  
<p>Having broken up the Sa<I>m</I>gha when it was at peace he is boiled for a Kalpa in Niraya."</p>  
<p>'To what (result of Karma), Lord, does that man give rise who brings about reconciliation in the Sa<I>m</I>gha when it has been split up?'</p>  
<p>'He gives rise, Up&acirc;li, to the highest merit, and for a Kalpa is he happy in heaven.</p>  
<p><DIR>"Blessed is concord in the Sa<I>m</I>gha, and the support of those who are at peace!<br> He who delights in peace, adhering to the Dhamma, is not cut off from Arahatship:<br> On reconciling the Sa<I>m</I>gha, when it was at strife, he is happy for a Kalpa in heaven."'</DIR></p>  
<p>5. 'Can it be, Lord, that one who breaks up the Sa<I>m</I>gha is irretrievably (doomed) to remain for a Kalpa in states of suffering and woe?'</p>  
<p>'Yes, Up&acirc;li, that can be.'</p>  
<p>'Can it be, Lord, that one who breaks up the Sa<I>m</I>gha is not doomed to be reborn in states either of suffering or of woe; that he is not doomed to remain so in such states for a Kalpa; and that he (his position) is not irretrievable?'</p>

On the two last of these expressions, see our notes on Mah&acirc;vagga IX, 4, 8. The first is there wrongly rendered, and should be translated as it is here; see the frequent passages in which the word occurs (e<I>g</I>. <I>K</I>ullavagga I, 5, 1; I, 6, 1; I, 27, 1; II, 1, &amp;c., where we have rendered it shortly 'a regular Bhikkhu').</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_735"></A><A HREF="sbe20078.htm#fr_749">267:1</A> Both the exact P&acirc;li form and the interpretation of these terms are uncertain. Buddhaghosa's notes will be found at p. 325 of H.O.'s edition of the text, and most probably we should there read parisa<I>m</I> in both cases.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_736"></A><A HREF="sbe20078.htm#fr_750">267:2</A> On the whole of the following section, compare above, VII, 3, 16, where much of the phraseology recurs.</P>

These expressions all recur in the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga, P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya I, 2, 2 and following sections, where the question at issue is whether an erroneous statement is, or is not, a conscious lie. The meaning of the whole is clear, though each of the words is used in a rather uncommon sense. On khanti, compare di<I>t</I><I>th</I>e sute khanti<I>m</I> akubbam&acirc;no (of the Arahat) at Sutta Nip&acirc;ta IV, 13, 3, and the standing use of the verb khamati, at the end of the Kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;s.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_742"></A><A HREF="sbe20078.htm#fr_756">271:1</A> The sum of the last two sections seems to come to this, that practically such a schism as would have the awful effects set out above in &sect; 4 would be impossible in Buddhism. For not only is a formal putting forward and voting on the false doctrine essential to schism as distinct from mere disagreement, but the offending Bhikkhu must also be quite aware that the doctrine so put forth is wrong, or at least doubtful, and also that the schism resulting from his action will be, or will probably be, disastrous to the Dhamma. In other words, the schism must be brought about by deliberately putting forward a doctrine known to be false, or at least doubtful, or with the express intention or hope of thereby injuring the cause of the Dhamma (that is, of the Truth).</P>
