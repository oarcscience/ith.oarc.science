### 16.

1\. Now when the Blessed One had dwelt at Sâvatthi as long as he thought
fit, he went on on his journey towards the Ki*t*â Hill with a great
multitude of Bhikkhus--to wit, with about five hundred Bhikkhus, besides
Sâriputta and Moggallâna.

And the Bhikkhus who were followers of Assa*g*i and Punabbasu <span
id="fr_602"></span>[1](#fn_592) hearing the news, said one to another,
'Come, Sirs; let us divide all the sleeping accommodation belonging to
the Sa*m*gha. Sâriputta and Moggallâna are men of sinful desires, and
are under the influence of sinful desires. We will not provide
sleeping-places for them.' And they did so.

Now the Blessed One, proceeding on his journey, arrived at the Ki*t*â
Hill. And he addressed a number of Bhikkhus, saying, 'Do you go, O
Bhikkhus, to the followers of Assa*g*i and Punabbasu, and say: "The
Blessed One, Sirs, has arrived with a large number of Bhikkhus--to wit,
with about five hundred Bhikkhus, besides Sâriputta and Moggallâna. Make
ready sleeping-places, Sirs, for the Blessed One, and for the
Bhikkhu-sa*m*gha, and for Sâriputta and Moggallâna."'

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

'Even so, Lord,' said those Bhikkhus in assent to the Blessed One and
they did so.

'There is no sleeping accommodation belonging to the Sa*m*gha. We have
divided it all' (was the reply). 'The Blessed One, Sirs, is welcome: and
he may stay in whatever Vihâra he chooses. But Sâriputta and Moggallâna
are men of sinful desires, and under the influence thereof; for them we
will provide no sleeping-places.'

2\. 'What then, Sirs? Have you divided sleeping accommodation that is
the property of the Sa*m*gha?'

'That is so, Sirs.'

The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &c. (down to) The Blessed One said to
the Bhikkhus:

'These five things, O Bhikkhus, are unapportionable, and are not to be
divided either by the Sa*m*gha, or by a Ga*n*a, or by an individual. If
divided, the division is void; and whosoever does so, shall be guilty of
a thulla*kk*aya. And what are the five (&c., as in V I, 15, 2) <span
id="fr_603"></span>[1](#fn_593)?'
