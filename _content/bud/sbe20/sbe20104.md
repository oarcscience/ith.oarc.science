### 13.

1\. Now at that time a certain woman, while her husband was on a
journey, became with child by a paramour. She had a premature delivery,
and asked a Bhikkhunî, a confederate of hers, to carry away the foetus
in her bowl. And that Bhikkhunî put it into her bowl, and, covering it
over with her upper robe, went away.

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu, who was on an alms-pilgrimage, had
made a vow not to partake of the first food given to him until he had
already given of it either to a Bhikkhu or to a Bhikkhunî. On seeing the
Bhikkhunî; that Bhikkhu said: 'Come, sister! take some food.'

'No thank you, Sir.'

\[And a second and a third time the Bhikkhu made the same request, and
received the same reply. Then he said,\]

'Sister! I have made a vow not to partake myself of the first food given
to me until I have already given of it either to a Bhikkhu or to a
Bhikkhunî. Come, sister! take the food.'

Then that Bhikkhunî, being so pressed by the Bhikkhu, pulled out her
bowl, and showed him what was inside of it. And the Bhikkhu was
indignant, and annoyed, and remonstrated, saying: 'How can you do such a
thing?' And he told the Bhikkhus, and they were indignant, &c., and told
the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to carry away a foetus in her bowl.
Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a. I allow a Bhikkhunî,
O Bhikkhus, on seeing a Bhikkhu, to pull out her bowl, and show it to
him.'
