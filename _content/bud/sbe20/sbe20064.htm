<p>1. Now the venerable Upananda the S&acirc;kyan, after having had a lodging allotted to him in</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> S&acirc;vatthi, went to a certain country-place where a community of the Sa<I>m</I>gha resided, and there also had a lodging allotted to him. Then the Bhikkhus there thought, 'Now this brother, Upananda the S&acirc;kyan, is a maker of strife, quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, a raiser of legal questions in the Sa<I>m</I>gha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. If he should spend the rainy season here, then shall we all dwell in discomfort. Come, let us question him.' And they asked the venerable Upananda the S&acirc;kyan:</p>  
<p>'Have not you, friend Upananda, had a lodging allotted to you in S&acirc;vatthi?'</p>  
<p>That is so, Sirs.'</p>  
<p>'What then do you, friend Upananda, being one, yet take exclusive possession of two (lodging-places)?'</p>  
<p>'Well, I do now, Sirs, set (the lodging) here free, and take the one there.'</p>  
<p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate murmured, &amp;c., and they told the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha, and asked the venerable Upananda the S&acirc;kyan:</p>  
<p>'Is it true, Upananda, that you, being one, have taken possession of two places?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord.'</p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One rebuked him, saying, 'How can you, O foolish one, do such a thing? What you took there, O foolish one, has been lost here; what you took here, has been lost there&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Thus, O</p>

<p>foolish one, you are deprived of both.' And when he had delivered a religious discourse, he said to the Bhikkhus:</p>  
<p>'One man is not, O Bhikkhus, to take two lodging-places. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>
