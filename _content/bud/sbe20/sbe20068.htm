<p>1. Now when the Blessed One had dwelt at S&acirc;vatthi as long as he thought fit, he went on&nbsp;on his journey towards the Ki<I>t</I>&acirc; Hill with a great multitude of Bhikkhus--to wit, with about five hundred Bhikkhus, besides S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na.</p>  
<p>And the Bhikkhus who were followers of Assa<I>g</I>i and Punabbasu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_602"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> hearing the news, said one to another, 'Come, Sirs; let us divide all the sleeping accommodation belonging to the Sa<I>m</I>gha. S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na are men of sinful desires, and are under the influence of sinful desires. We will not provide sleeping-places for them.' And they did so.</p>  
<p>Now the Blessed One, proceeding on his journey, arrived at the Ki<I>t</I>&acirc; Hill. And he addressed a number of Bhikkhus, saying, 'Do you go, O Bhikkhus, to the followers of Assa<I>g</I>i and Punabbasu, and say: "The Blessed One, Sirs, has arrived with a large number of Bhikkhus--to wit, with about five hundred Bhikkhus, besides S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na. Make ready sleeping-places, Sirs, for the Blessed One, and for the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha, and for S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na."'</p>  
<p>

<p>'Even so, Lord,' said those Bhikkhus in assent to the Blessed One and they did so.</p>  
<p>'There is no sleeping accommodation belonging to the Sa<I>m</I>gha. We have divided it all' (was the reply). 'The Blessed One, Sirs, is welcome: and he may stay in whatever Vih&acirc;ra he chooses. But S&acirc;riputta and Moggall&acirc;na are men of sinful desires, and under the influence thereof; for them we will provide no sleeping-places.'</p>  
<p>2. 'What then, Sirs? Have you divided sleeping accommodation that is the property of the Sa<I>m</I>gha?'</p>  
<p>'That is so, Sirs.'</p>  
<p>The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &amp;c. (down to) The Blessed One said to the Bhikkhus:</p>  
<p>'These five things, O Bhikkhus, are unapportionable, and are not to be divided either by the Sa<I>m</I>gha, or by a Ga<I>n</I>a, or by an individual. If divided, the division is void; and whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a thulla<I>k</I><I>k</I>aya. And what are the five (&amp;c., as in V I, 15, 2)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?'</p>
