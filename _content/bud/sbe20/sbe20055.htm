<p>1. Now at that time the sleeping-rooms of the Titthiyas were whitewashed, the floors of their rooms were coloured black, and the walls coloured with red chalk&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Much people went to look at their sleeping-rooms.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use in your Vih&acirc;ras of whitewash, black colouring, and red colouring.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the whitewash would not lie on to the rough walls.</p>

<p>The whitewash would not adhere.</p>

<p>Now at that time the colouring matter of red chalk would not lie on the rough walls.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to apply the husks of grain made up into little balls; and when you have thus removed the unevenness with your hands, to lay on the colouring matter of red chalk.'</p>

<p>Still the red colouring matter would not adhere.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a paste made of mustard seed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and of oil of beeswax&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.' </p>

<p>Still the black colouring matter would not adhere.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of slime and astringent liquid&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus had imaginative drawings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> painted on their Vih&acirc;ras--figures of men, and figures of women.</p>  
<p>People, when they saw them on going to visit the Vih&acirc;ras; murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like those who still enjoy the pleasures of the world.'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have imaginative drawings painted figures of men, and figures of</p>

<p>women. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, representations of wreaths and creepers and bone hooks and cupboards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_494"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>3. Now at that time the Vih&acirc;ras had too low a basement (&amp;c., as in V, 11, 6 as to roofing, stairs, and balustrade).</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Vih&acirc;ras were crowded with people&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The Bhikkhus were ashamed to lie down to sleep.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of curtains.'</p>  
<p>They lifted up the curtains and looked in.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to put up a lath and plaster wall half the height of the Vih&acirc;ra.'</p>  
<p>They looked on from over this half-wall.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make inner chambers of three kinds--chambers in shape like a palankeen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, chambers in shape like a quart measure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and chambers on an upper storey&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.'</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus made inner chambers in the middle of small Vih&acirc;ras, and there was no room to move about in.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make the inner chambers at one side of small Vih&acirc;ras, and in the middle of large ones&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>4. Now at that time the lower part of the lath and plaster wall of the Vih&acirc;ra decayed.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, buttresses of timber&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Rain leaked through on to the lath and plaster wall of the Vih&acirc;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a protecting arrangement&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and cement&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time a snake fell from the roof on to the back of a certain Bhikkhu. He was terrified, and made an outcry&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_514"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. The Bhikkhus, running up, said to that Bhikkhu: 'Why, Sir, do you make an outcry?' Then that Bhikkhu told the matter to</p>

<p><A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the Bhikkhus, and they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a ceiling-cloth.'</p>  
<p>5. Now at that time the Bhikkhus hung their bags at the feet of the bedsteads, and at the feet of the chairs; and they were gnawed by the mice and white ants.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, pins in the wall, and bone hooks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus laid aside their robes on the bedsteads and on the chairs, and the robes were torn.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, bamboos to hang your robes on, and strings to hang your robes on&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Vih&acirc;ras had no verandahs, and no defences&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, verandahs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, covered terraces&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_519"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, inner verandahs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_520"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and over-hanging eaves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.'</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The verandahs were. too public; and the Bhikkhus were ashamed to lie down in them to sleep.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, an arrangement in form of a curtain that can be drawn aside&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, or an arrangement in form of a moveable screen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>6. Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when taking their midday meal in the open air, were troubled by cold and heat.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a Service Hall.'</p>  
<p>The Service Hall had too low a basement (&amp;c., as in V, 11, 6, down to the end).</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus spread their robes out on the ground in the open air, and they became dirty.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, bamboos to hang robes on, and strings to hang robes in, in the open air.</p>  
<p>7. The water became warm.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a water-room and a water-shed.'</p>  
<p>The water-room had too low a basement (&amp;c., as in V, 11, 6, down to the end).</p>  
<p>There were no vessels for the water.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, chank shells and saucers for the water.'</p>  
<p>8. Now at that time the Vih&acirc;ras had no fence round them.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to enclose them with</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A></p>  
<p>ramparts (P&acirc;k&acirc;ra) of three kinds--brick walls, stone walls, and wooden fences.'</p>  
<p>There was no store-room&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a store-room.'</p>  
<p>The store-room had too low a basement, and it was flooded with water.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make it with a high basement.'</p>  
<p>The store-room had no door.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a door; with door-posts and lintel, with hollows like a mortar for the door to revolve in, with projections to revolve in those hollows, with rings on the door for the bolt to work along in, with a block of wood fixed into the edge of the door-post, and containing a cavity for the bolt to go into (called the Monkey's Head), with a pin to secure the bolt by, with a connecting bolt, with a key-hole, with a hole for a string with which the door may be closed, and with a string for that purpose&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Grass and plaster fell from the store-room.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as in V, 14, 4. down to the end of V, 14, 5, as to roofing, flooring, drains, &amp;c.).'</p>  
<p>9. Now at that time the Bhikkhus made fire-places here and there in the Parive<I>n</I>a, and the Parive<I>n</I>a was covered with the remains of the fires&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A></p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make a separate room for the fire at one side.'</p>  
<p>The fire-room had too low a basement (&amp;c., as in V, 11, 6, as to flooring, stairs, and balustrade, followed by the paragraph as to the door, and the facing, as in V, 14, 3, &amp;c.).</p>  
<p>10. Now at that time the &Acirc;r&acirc;mas had no fences to them, and goats and cattle injured the plantations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to surround them with fencing of three kinds--bamboo fences, thorn fences, and ditches.'</p>  
<p>There was no gateway (k o t l h a k a), and goats and cattle, even so, injured the plantations.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a gateway, with gates made of stakes interlaced with thorny brakes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, with fences (across the gateway) made of the akka plant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_529"></A><A HREF="#fn_519"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, with ornamental screen-work over the gateway&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_520"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and with bars.'</p>  
<p>[Then the paragraphs allowing the roofing, &amp;c., of this ko<I>t</I><I>th</I>aka as in V, 11, 6, and drains for the &Acirc;r&acirc;ma, as in V, 14, 3.]</p>  
<p>11. Now at that time Seniya Bimbis&acirc;ra, the king of Magadha, wanted to build a p&acirc;s&acirc;da&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> (residence),</p>

<p>covered with cement and clay, for the use of the Sa<I>m</I>gha. And it occurred to the Bhikkhus, 'What kind of roof now has been allowed by the Blessed One, and what kind of roof has not been allowed?'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, roofing of five kinds--brick roofing, stone roofing, cement roofing, straw roofing, and roofing of leaves.'</p>
