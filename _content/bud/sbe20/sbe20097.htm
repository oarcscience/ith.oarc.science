<p>1. Now at that time the P&acirc;timokkha was not recited to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow the P&acirc;timokkha, O Bhikkhus, to be recited to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s.'</p>  
<p>Now it occurred to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s: 'By whom should the P&acirc;timokkha be recited to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s?'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the P&acirc;timokkha to be recited to Bhikkhun&icirc;s by Bhikkhus.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time Bhikkhus went to the residence of the Bhikkhun&icirc;s and recited the P&acirc;timokkha to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s there. The people murmured, and were indignant, saying: 'There are their wives, there are their mistresses; now will they take pleasure together.'</p>  
<p>The Bhikkhus heard this, and told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Bhikkhus are not, O Bhikkhus, to recite the</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> P&acirc;timokkha to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s at their residence. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow Bhikkhun&icirc;s, O Bhikkhus, to recite the P&acirc;timokkha to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s.'</p>  
<p>The Bhikkhun&icirc;s did not know how to recite the P&acirc;timokkha. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to tell Bhikkhun&icirc;s how to recite the P&acirc;timokkha.'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time the Bhikkhun&icirc;s did not confess the faults (they had committed).</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'A Bhikkhun&icirc;, O Bhikkhus, is not to leave a fault unconfessed. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>The Bhikkhun&icirc;s did not know how to confess their faults. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to tell Bhikkhun&icirc;s how they should confess their faults.'</p>  
<p>Then it occurred to the Bhikkhus: 'By whom ought the confession of a fault to be received from the Bhikkhun&icirc;s?' They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to receive the confession of a fault from Bhikkhun&icirc;s.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time Bhikkhun&icirc;s, on seeing a Bhikkhu on the road, or in a street closed at one end, or at the place where four cross-roads met, would place their bowl on the ground, and arranging their robes over one shoulder, would crouch down on their heels, and stretch forth their joined hands, and confess a fault. The people murmured, were indignant, and complained, saying: 'There are their wives, there are their mistresses; they are asking</p>

<p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to tell Bhikkhun&icirc;s how to receive the confession of a fault.'</p>  
<p>3. Now at that time disciplinary proceedings (Kammas) were not carried out against Bhikkhun&icirc;s. They told that matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow disciplinary proceedings, O Bhikkhus, to be carried out against Bhikkhun&icirc;s.'</p>  
<p>Then the Bhikkhus thought: 'By whom ought disciplinary proceedings to be carried out against Bhikkhun&icirc;s?' They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to carry out disciplinary proceedings against Bhikkhun&icirc;s.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time Bhikkhun&icirc;s who had been subjected to disciplinary proceedings, on seeing a Bhikkhu on the road, or in a street closed at one end, or at the place where four cross-roads met, would place their bowls on the ground, and arranging their robes over one shoulder, would crouch down on their heels, and stretching out their joined palms would ask for pardon, thinking that that was the proper time for doing so. The people murmured [&amp;c., as before].</p>
