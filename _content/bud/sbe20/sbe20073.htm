<p>1. Now when the Blessed One had remained at &Acirc;<I>l</I>av&icirc; as long as he thought fit, he set out on his journey towards R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha. And proceeding straight on, he arrived in due course at R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha. And there, at R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha, the Blessed One stayed at the Ve<I>l</I>uvana in the Kalandaka Niv&acirc;pa.</p>  
<p>Now at that time there was a scarcity of food at R&acirc;<I>g</I>agaha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_629"></A><A HREF="#fn_619"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The people were unable to provide food for the (whole) Sa<I>m</I>gha and they were desirous of providing food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_630"></A><A HREF="#fn_620"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (to be sent to the Vih&acirc;ra) for the use of a special Bhikkhu (designated by the donor)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_631"></A><A HREF="#fn_621"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> or for special Bhikkhus invited (by the donor in his own house)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_632"></A><A HREF="#fn_622"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> or for (single Bhikkhus) appointed by ticket (issued by the Sa<I>m</I>gha)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_633"></A><A HREF="#fn_623"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, or of providing food during a fortnight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_634"></A><A HREF="#fn_624"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, or on Uposatha</p>

<p>days (that is, on the last days of each fortnight) or on the first days of each fortnight.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, each of three ways of obtaining food.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus having received good food for themselves, gave over the worse food (which they had also received) to the other Bhikkhus.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as apportioner of rations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_635"></A><A HREF="#fn_625"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a Bhikkhu who is possessed of the following five qualifications--(&amp;c., as in IV, 9, down to the end of the Kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;):</p>  
<p>Now the Bhikkhus who were apportioners of rations, thought: 'How then are the rations to be apportioned?'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you. O Bhikkhus, to apportion them by arranging the food in small heaps, and fastening tickets or marks upon them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_636"></A><A HREF="#fn_626"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>

<p>of lodging-places--no overseer of stores--no receiver of robes--no distributor of robes, of congey, or of fruits--and no distributor of dry foods, and through not being distributed it went bad.</p>  
<p>They told each of these matters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_637"></A><A HREF="#fn_627"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as distributor of lodging-places, &amp;c., a Bhikkhu who has (&amp;c., as in &sect; 1, down to the end of the Kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;, inserting throughout the appropriate variations in the fifth qualification).</p>  
<p>3. Now at that time articles of trifling value had accumulated in the storehouse of the Sa<I>m</I>gha.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to appoint as disposer of trifles a Bhikkhu who has (&amp;c., as before, down to the end of the Kammav&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;). Each separate needle, and pair of scissors, and pair of sandals, and girdle, and pair of braces, and filtering cloth, and regulation strainer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_638"></A><A HREF="#fn_628"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and plait&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_639"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and half-plait&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_640"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and gusset&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_641"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and half-gusset&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_642"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and binding&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_643"></A><A HREF="#fn_630"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and braiding&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_644"></A><A HREF="#fn_630"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, is to be given away.

<P><A NAME="fn_619"></A><A HREF="sbe20073.htm#fr_629">220:1</A> Other special rules for times of scarcity will be found at Mah&acirc;vagga VI, 17, 7; 18, 4; 19, 2; 20, 4 (repealed for times of plenty in VI, 32). Compare also P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika IV, 1, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_620"></A><A HREF="sbe20073.htm#fr_630">220:2</A> The above modes of receiving food (instead of collecting in a bowl morsels of food given in alms) are the dispensations allowed by Mah&acirc;vagga I, 30, 4.</P>

Both Childers sub voce and Frankfurter <A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A> ('Pali Handbook,' p. 165), in interpreting the passage at Mah&acirc;vagga I, 30, 4, take this to mean a feast given on the eighth day of the month. But paksha is the half-month. The expression much more probably means, therefore, to provide food either during the whole of a half-month for one or more specially invited Bhikkhus, or for a larger number on any one day of the half-month to be chosen by the Sa<I>m</I>gha.</P>

According to VI, 15, 10, none of these five <A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A> kinds of medicine were to be kept for a period exceeding seven days, but that was a rule that was not very probable to be strictly followed.</P>
