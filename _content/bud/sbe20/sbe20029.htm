<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make it level.'</p>  
<p>The cloister had too low a basement, and was inundated with water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_255"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>They found difficulty in getting up into it.</p>

<p>As they were going up them, they fell off.</p>

<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus, when walking up and down in the cloister, fell down.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of a hall for the cloister&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,'</p>  
<p>Straw and plaster fell (from the walls and roof) into the cloister-hall.</p>

<p>The bath house had no door.</p>

<p>The fire in the bath-room scorched their bodies.</p>

This word has already occurred at Mah&acirc;vagga VI, 14, 7, where Buddhaghosa's explanation is much the same. See also Mah&acirc;vagga VIII, 1, 30.</p>

<p>some business or other. And on seeing the Bhikkhus very sick with superfluity of humors, he went up to where the Blessed One was; and when he had come there, he saluted the Blessed One and took his seat on one side. And when so seated he said to the Blessed One: 'The Bhikkhus, Lord are now very sick with superfluity of humors. It would be well if the Blessed One were to prescribe, Lord for the Bhikkhus the use of the cloister&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and of the bath-room&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_254"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

<p>Then the Blessed One instructed, and aroused, and incited, and gladdened <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka Kom&acirc;rabha<I>k</I><I>k</I>a with religious discourse. And <I>G</I>&icirc;vaka Kom&acirc;rabha<I>k</I><I>k</I>a; so instructed, and incited, and aroused, and gladdened with religious discourse, arose from his seat and saluted the Blessed One, and keeping him on his right hand as he passed him, departed thence. And the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, convened an assembly of the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha, and addressed the Bhikkhus, and said, 'I</p>

It was not ordinarily used for cold baths, which were taken in the rivers or tanks, but for a kind of hot-water bath, or perhaps steam bath, the exact mode of taking or administering which is not as yet certain. Several Bhikkhus took the bath at the same time, but it is not likely that they got into the water (though the expression uttarati is used, loc. cit., of their leaving the bath), as they scarcely would have made vessels large enough to contain a man. It rather seems that they sat on stools close to a large fire, and had water poured over them. The use of this kind of bath is forbidden to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s at <I>K</I>ullavagga X, 27, 4.</P>

Kav&acirc;<I>t</I>a-pi<I>t</I><I>th</I>a occurs in Mah&acirc;vagga I, 25, 15, and in the Samanta P&acirc;s&acirc;dik&acirc; on P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya 19 (compare upari-pi<I>t</I><I>th</I>iti at <I>K</I>ullavagga VIII, 1, 1), and this and the two following phrases below, VI, 2, 1. Buddhaghosa has nothing on them, either here or there; and they were probably therefore in quite common use even in his day. The whole of this paragraph recurs below, VI, 3, 7.</P>

Presumably the door had no hinges, but the upper and lower ends of one side projected into hollows pre-pared for them in the lintel and the threshold.

Buddhaghosa's commentary on the word in the former of these two passages is given by Rh. D. in his note at p. 95 of the 'Buddhist Suttas.'</P>

As the principal bolt was probably called aggala (unless that were the name for the whole machinery), this was some smaller bolt.

<P><A NAME="fn_270"></A><A HREF="sbe20029.htm#fr_276">108:3</A> Udaka-niddhamana<I>m</I>. See <I>G</I>&acirc;taka I, 175, 409, 425, 489, in which passages an entrance to, or an exit from, a palace or a city is effected respectively niddhamana-mukhena, niddhamana-dv&acirc;rena, niddhamanena, and niddhamana-maggena. Our phrase here recurs below, V, 35, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_271"></A><A HREF="sbe20029.htm#fr_277">108:4</A> Gatt&acirc;ni ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>uvanti. Gatt&acirc;ni is nominative, not accusative. Compare Mah&acirc;vagga VI, 14, 5, where ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>uvati is used in the neuter sense. ('The sore was irritable!)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_272"></A><A HREF="sbe20029.htm#fr_278">109:1</A> Ko<I>t</I><I>th</I>ako. This word means a room without a window; and it is used either of 1. 'a room over a gateway,' or 2. 'a room used as a store-room.' (Compare Mah&acirc;vagga III, 5, 6, 9; <I>K</I>ullavagga IV, 4, 6, 7, VI, 3, 7, 9, VI, 4, 10, IX, I, 2; and <I>G</I>&acirc;taka I, 179, 227, 230, II, 168.) The whole of this paragraph recurs below, V, 35, 4, of the ko<I>t</I><I>th</I>aka to a privy; and the two passages taker together show that an entrance room or passage, a porch or ante-chamber, is meant, in which the water was kept ready for use For that reason this particular kind of ko<I>t</I><I>th</I>aka is elsewhere called, in both connections, udaka-ko<I>t</I><I>th</I>aka (Mah&acirc;vagga VI, 14, 3, of the bath-room--where see Buddhaghosa's note quoted in our 'Vinaya Texts,' vol. ii, p. 57--and Dhammapada, p. 103, of the privy). Buddhaghosa explains it here by dv&acirc;ra-ko<I>t</I><I>th</I>ako; and it occurs again below, VIII, 8, 2, in the same sense.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_273"></A><A HREF="sbe20029.htm#fr_279">109:2</A> The last two items in &sect; 2 are supplied for this case also in the next chapter but one.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_274"></A><A HREF="sbe20029.htm#fr_280">109:3</A> Parive<I>n</I>a is doubtless here, and below at VIII, 8, 2 in the same connection, a cell used as a cooling-room, after the steam bath. Buddhaghosa says nothing here, but gives a note below, V, 35, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_275"></A><A HREF="sbe20029.htm#fr_281">109:4</A> Marumba.
