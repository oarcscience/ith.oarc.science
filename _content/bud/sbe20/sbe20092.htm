<p>1. Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was staying among the S&acirc;kyas in Kapilavatthu, in the Nigrodh&acirc;r&acirc;ma. And Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; went to the place where the Blessed One was, and on arriving there, bowed down before the Blessed One, and remained standing on one side. And so standing she spake thus to the Blessed One:</p>  
<p>'It would be well, Lord, if women should be allowed to renounce their homes and enter the homeless state under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Tath&acirc;gata.'</p>  
<p>'Enough, O Gotam&icirc;! Let it not please thee that women should be allowed to do so.'</p>  
<p>[And a second and a third time did Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; make the same request in the same words, and receive the same reply.]</p>  
<p>Then Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; sad and sorrowful for that the Blessed One would not permit women to enter the homeless state, bowed down before the Blessed One, and keeping him on her right hand as she passed him, departed thence weeping and in tears.</p>  
<p>2. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Kapilavatthu as long as he thought fit, he set out on his journey towards Ves&acirc;l&icirc;; and travelling</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_321"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 321</FONT></A></p>  
<p>straight on he in due course arrived thereat. And there at Ves&acirc;l&icirc; the Blessed One stayed, in the Mah&acirc;vana, in the K&ucirc;<I>t</I>&acirc;g&acirc;ra Hall.</p>  
<p>And Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; cut off her hair, and put on orange-coloured robes, and set out, with a number of women of the S&acirc;kya clan, towards Ves&acirc;l&icirc;; and in due course she arrived at Ves&acirc;l&icirc;, at the Mah&acirc;vana, at the K&ucirc;<I>t</I>&acirc;g&acirc;ra Hall. And Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc;, with swollen feet and covered with dust, sad and sorrowful, weeping and in tears, took her stand outside under the entrance porch.</p>  
<p>And the venerable &Acirc;nanda saw her so standing there, and on seeing her so, he said to Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc;?: 'Why standest thou there, outside the porch, with swollen feet and covered with dust, sad and sorrowful, weeping and in tears?'</p>  
<p>'Inasmuch, O &Acirc;nanda, as the Lord, the Blessed One, does not permit women to renounce their homes and enter the homeless state under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Tath&acirc;gata.'</p>  
<p>3. Then did the venerable &Acirc;nanda go up to the place where the Blessed One was, and bow down before the Blessed One, and take his seat on one side. And, so sitting, the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to the Blessed One:</p>  
<p>'Behold, Lord, Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; is standing outside under the entrance porch, with swollen feet and covered with dust, sad and sorrowful, weeping and in tears, inasmuch as the Blessed One does not permit women to renounce their homes and enter the homeless state under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Blessed One. It were well, Lord, if women were to have permission granted to them to do as she desires.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_322"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 322</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Enough, &Acirc;nanda! Let it not please thee that women should be allowed to do so.'</p>  
<p>[And a second and a third time did &Acirc;nanda make the same request, in the same words, and receive the same reply.]</p>  
<p>Then the venerable &Acirc;nanda thought: 'The Blessed One does not give his permission, let me now ask the Blessed One on another ground.' And the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to the Blessed One:</p>  
<p>'Are women, Lord, capable--when they have gone forth from the household life and entered the homeless state, under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Blessed One--are they capable of realising the fruit of conversion, or of the second Path, or of the third Path, or of Arahatship?'</p>  
<p>'They are capable, &Acirc;nanda.'</p>  
<p>'If then, Lord, they are capable thereof, since Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; has proved herself of great service to the Blessed One, when as aunt and nurse she nourished him and gave him milk, and on the death of his mother suckled the Blessed One at her own breast, it were well, Lord, that women should have permission to go forth from the household life and enter the homeless state, under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Tath&acirc;gata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_863"></A><A HREF="#fn_849"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>4. 'If then, &Acirc;nanda, Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; take upon herself the Eight Chief Rules&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_864"></A><A HREF="#fn_850"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> let that be reckoned to her as her initiation.'</p>

This is a rule . . . . never to be transgressed.</p>  
<p>(4) 'After keeping the rainy season (of Was), the Bhikkhun&icirc; is to hold Pav&acirc;ra<I>n</I>&acirc; (to enquire whether any fault can be laid to her charge) before both Sa<I>m</I>ghas--as well that of Bhikkhus as that of Bhikkhun&icirc;s--with respect to three matters, namely, what has been seen, and what has been heard, and what has been suspected&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_869"></A><A HREF="#fn_855"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.

<p>5. Then the venerable &Acirc;nanda, when he had learnt from the Blessed One these Eight Chief Rules, went to Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc; and [told her all that the Blessed One had said].</p>

<p>6. Then the venerable &Acirc;nanda returned to the Blessed One, and bowed down before him, and took his seat on one side. And, so sitting, the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to the Blessed One: 'Mah&acirc;-pa<I>g</I>&acirc;pat&icirc; the Gotam&icirc;, Lord, has taken upon herself the Eight Chief Rules, the aunt of the Blessed One, has received the upasampad&acirc; initiation.'</p>

But since, &Acirc;nanda, women have now received that permission, the pure religion, &Acirc;nanda, will not now last so long, the good law will now stand fast for only five hundred years. Just, &Acirc;nanda, as houses in which there are many women&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_874"></A><A HREF="#fn_860"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and but few men are easily violated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_875"></A><A HREF="#fn_861"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by robber burglars&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_862"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; just so, &Acirc;nanda, under</p>

<p>whatever doctrine and discipline women are allowed to go out from the household life into the homeless state, that religion will not last long. And just, &Acirc;nanda, as when the disease called mildew falls upon a field of rice in fine condition, that field of rice does not continue long; just so, &Acirc;nanda, under whatsoever doctrine and discipline women are allowed to go forth from the household <I>li</I>fe into the homeless state, that religion will not last long. And just, &Acirc;nanda, as when the disease called blight falls upon a field of sugar-cane in good condition, that field of sugar-cane does not continue long; just so, &Acirc;nanda, under whatsoever doctrine and discipline women are allowed to go forth from the household life into the homeless state, that religion does not last long. And just, &Acirc;nanda, as a man would in anticipation build an embankment to a great reservoir, beyond which the water should not overpass; just even so, &Acirc;nanda, have I in anticipation laid down these Eight Chief Rules for the Bhikkhun&icirc;s, their life long not to be overpassed.'</p>
