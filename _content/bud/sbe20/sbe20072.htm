<P><A NAME="fn_614"></A><A HREF="sbe20072.htm#fr_624">218:4</A> With this should be compared the other rule in Mah&acirc;vagga V, 6, 1, according to which the Bhikkhus were to wear sandals when getting upon bedsteads or chairs, lest these should become soiled. The two passages are parallel in wording throughout.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_615"></A><A HREF="sbe20072.htm#fr_625">218:5</A> Parikammakat&acirc;ya. The floors were of earth, not of wood, and were restored from time to time by fresh clay or dry cowdung being laid down, and then covered with a whitewash, in which sometimes black or red (geruka) was mixed. See above, V, 11, 6; VI, 3, 1; 17, 1; 27. From the parallel passage at Mah&acirc;vagga I, 25, 15, and <I>K</I>ullavagga VIII, 3, 1, it would seem that the red colouring was used rather for walls, and the black one for floors.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_616"></A><A HREF="sbe20072.htm#fr_626">219:1</A> 'The walls were no doubt usually made with 'wattle and daub;' that is, sticks with clay between the interstices. This was treated from time to time like the flooring (see last note).</P>

This article of furniture is mentioned, with the spittoon, in Mah&acirc;vagga I, 45, 15, 16, and in the parallel passage at <I>K</I>ullavagga VIII, 1, 3. We have rendered it in the Mah&acirc;vagga by 'board to recline on.' Compare the use of apassaya<I>m</I> in Buddhaghosa's note on <I>K</I>ullavagga VI, 2, 4 (above, <A HREF="sbe20048.htm#page_153">p. 153</A>, note 3) of an arm-chair or sofa.</P>
