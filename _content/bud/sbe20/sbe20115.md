### 24.

1\. Now at that time a certain lay disciple had given to the
Bhikkhunî-sa*m*gha a servant's lodge <span

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a stable.'

It did not satisfy (their wants) <span id="fr_949"></span>[3](#fn_933).
They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a separate residence for Bhikkhunîs.'

That did not satisfy their wants. They told this matter to the Blessed
One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, building operations <span
id="fr_950"></span>[4](#fn_934) (to be carried on for the benefit of
Bhikkhunîs).'

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

That did not satisfy their wants. They told this matter to the Blessed
One.

'I allow Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, to assign certain places to live in to
individual members of the Order <span id="fr_951"></span>[1](#fn_935).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_932"></span>[363:2](sbe20115.htm#fr_948) This word has
already occurred, in a list of various buildings, at Mahâvagga III, 5,
9, where we have rendered it stable. Buddhaghosa says here uddositan
(MS. udosita) ti bha*nd*a-sâlâ, and as at Mahâvagga I, 61, assa-bha*nd*â
and hatthi-bha*nd*â are evidently grooms attending on horses or
elephants (compare *G*âtaka I, 62, 3), bha*nd*a-sâlâ may mean a
servant's hall for the use of that particular class of servants. A
lawsuit about an uddosita forms the Introductory Story to the 1st
Bhikkhunî Sa*m*ghâdisesa, but the passage throws no light on the special
meaning of the term. See also the Sutta-vibhaṅga on Nissaggiya II, 3, 5,
and Khudda Sikkhâ III, 19. The Sanskrit equivalent might perhaps be
udavasita, if the reading of the Samanta Pâsâdikâ had any traditional
value; but the dd is not doubtful in the MSS. of the text at any of the
passages quoted. Assa-sâlâ is the word for stable at *G*âtaka I, 62, 3.
