<p>'Now surely, that Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, had not let his love flow out over the four royal breeds of serpents! Had he done so, he would not die of the bite of a snake. And which are the four royal breeds of serpents? The Vir&ucirc;pakkhas are a royal breed. The Er&acirc;pathas are a royal breed. The <I>Kh</I>aby&acirc;puttas are a royal breed. The Ka<I>n</I>h&acirc;gotamakas are a royal breed. Now surely that Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, had not let his love flow out over the four royal breeds of serpents! Had he done so, he would not die of the bite of a snake. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to make use of a safeguard for yourselves for your security and protection, by letting your love flow out over the four royal breeds of serpents. And thus, O Bhikkhus, are you to do so.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_150"></A><A HREF="sbe20021.htm#fr_155">75:4</A> This ancient legend has been expanded into a <I>G</I>&acirc;taka story, under the title of Khandha-vatta <I>G</I>&acirc;taka, No. 203 in Professor Fausb&ouml;ll's edition (vol. ii, pp. 144-148), in which recur all the verses here given as a snake-charm. The names of the serpents are derived from the ancient mythology, and are not to be supposed to refer to actual breeds of real snakes. Below, <I>K</I>ullavagga VI, 2, 5, where a Bhikkhu is bitten by a snake, the simple precaution enjoined is the use of a higher bedstead.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_151"></A><A HREF="sbe20021.htm#fr_156">76:1</A> This phrase occurs in the passage at Mah&acirc;-parinibb&acirc;na Sutta I, 31, by which Buddhaghosa is so much perplexed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_152"></A><A HREF="sbe20021.htm#fr_157">77:1</A> This is only one of the many passages from which it is evident that in the oldest Buddhism only the seven Buddhas, from Vipassi down to Gotama inclusive, were known by name to the members of the Buddhist community. Compare Rh. D.'s 'Hibbert Lectures, 1881,' p. 142. It is nevertheless probable that, with their ideas as to the infinite number of worlds which had succeeded one another in the past, they considered that the number of previous Buddhas had also been infinite.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_153"></A><A HREF="sbe20021.htm#fr_158">77:2</A> This last injunction, which comes in here so tamely, is omitted in the <I>G</I>&acirc;taka story, and is merely a hook on which to hang an excuse for introducing this ancient and evidently favourite prescription into the Vinaya. That it is quite out of place is sufficiently evident from the fact that it has already been laid down in identical terms in the Mah&acirc;vagga VI, 14, 4, where it is found in its natural connection.</P>
