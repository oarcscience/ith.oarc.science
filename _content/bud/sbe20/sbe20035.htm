<p>1. Now at that time Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi was a friend of the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<I>g</I>aka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi went up to the place where those Bhikkhus were, and on arriving there he said to them, 'My salutation to you, Sirs!' When he had thus spoken, the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<I>g</I>aka gave him no reply. And a second and a third time [he said the same words, and still received no reply].</p>  
<p>'Wherein have I offended you, Sirs? Why do you give me no reply?'</p>  
<p>'Therein, that you, friend, sit contented while we are being molested by Dabba the Mallian.'</p>  
<p>'But what, Sirs, can I do?'</p>  
<p>'If you wished it, friend, to-day even would the Blessed One expel Dabba the Mallian.'</p>  
<p>'But what shall I do, Sirs? What is that it is in my power to do?'</p>  
<p>'Come then, friend Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a. Do you go up to the place where the Blessed One is, and when you have come there, say as follows: "This, Lord, is neither fit nor becoming that the very quarter of the heavens which ought to be safe, secure, and free from danger,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that from that very quarter should arise danger, calamity, and distress--that where one ought to expect a calm, that just there one should meet a gale! Methinks the very water has taken fire! My wife has been defiled by Dabba the Mallian!"'</p>  
<p>2. 'Very well, Sirs!' said Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi, accepting the word of the followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<I>g</I>aka. And he went up to the Blessed One [and spake even as he had been directed].</p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha, and asked the venerable Dabba the Mallian:</p>  
<p>'Are you conscious&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_315"></A><A HREF="#fn_309"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, Dabba, of having done such a thing as this Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a says?'</p>  
<p>'As my Lord, the Blessed One, knows.'</p>  
<p>[And a second, and a third time, the Blessed One asked the same question, and received the same reply.]</p>  
<p>'The Dabbas, O Dabba, do not thus repudiate. If you have done it, say so. If you have not done it, say you have not.'</p>  
<p>'Since I was born, Lord, I cannot call to mind that I have practised sexual intercourse, even in a dream, much less when I was awake!'</p>  
<p>3. Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Let then the Sa<I>m</I>gha, O Bhikkhus, turn the bowl down&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_316"></A><A HREF="#fn_310"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in respect of Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi,</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and make him incapable of granting an alms to the Sa<I>m</I>gha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_311"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'There are eight things, O Bhikkhus, which when they characterise an Up&acirc;saka, the bowl is to be turned down in respect of him;--when he goes about to bring loss of gifts on the Bhikkhus, when he goes about to bring harm to the Bhikkhus, when he goes about to cause the Bhikkhus to want a place of residence, when he reviles or slanders the Bhikkhus, when he causes divisions between Bhikkhus and Bhikkhus;--when he speaks in dispraise of the Buddha,;--when he speaks in dispraise of the Dhamma;--when he speaks in dispraise of the Sa<I>m</I>gha. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to turn down the bowl in respect of an Up&acirc;saka who is characterised by these eight things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_318"></A><A HREF="#fn_312"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>4. 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is the bowl to be turned down. Some able and discreet Bhikkhu is to lay the matter before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, saying,</p>

<p>'"Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. Vaddha the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi has brought a groundless charge against the venerable Dabba the Mallian of a breach of morality. If the time seems meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha turn down the bowl as respects Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi, and make him as one who has no dealings with the Sa<I>m</I>gha.</p>  
<p>'"This is the motion (<I>&ntilde;</I>atti).</p>  
<p>'"Vaddha the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi has brought a groundless charge against Dabba the Mallian of a breach of morality. The Sa<I>m</I>gha turns down the bowl as respects Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi, and makes him as one who has no dealings with the Sa<I>m</I>gha. Whosoever of the venerable ones approves of the bowl being turned down as regards Vaddha the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi, and of making him as one who has no dealings with the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let him keep silence. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak.</p>  
<p>'"The bowl is turned down by the Sa<I>m</I>gha as regards Vaddha the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi, he is as one who has no dealings with the Sa<I>m</I>gha. The Sa<I>m</I>gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."'</p>  
<p>5. Then the venerable &Acirc;nanda, having dressed himself early in the morning, went, duly bowled and robed, to the residence of Vaddha the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi. And when he had come there he spake to Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi, and said: 'The bowl, friend Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a, has been turned down by the Sa<I>m</I>gha as regards you, and you are as one who has no dealings with the Sa<I>m</I>gha.' And Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi, on hearing that saying, immediately&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_319"></A><A HREF="#fn_313"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> fainted and fell.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Then the friends and companions of Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi, and his relatives of one blood with him, said to him: 'It is enough, friend Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a. Weep not, neither lament. We will reconcile&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the Blessed One to you, and the Order of Bhikkhus.'</p>  
<p>And Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi, with his wife and his children, and with his friends and companions, and with his relatives of one blood with him, went up, with wet garments and with streaming hair, to the place where the Blessed One was; and when he had come there, he cast himself down with his head at the feet of the Blessed One, and said: 'Sin has overcome me, Lord--even according to my weakness, according to my folly, according to my unrighteousness--in that without ground I brought a charge against Dabba the Mallian of a breach of morality. In respect thereof may my Lord the Blessed One accept the confession I make of my sin in its sinfulness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_321"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, to the end that I may in future restrain myself therefrom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_322"></A><A HREF="#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>'Verily, O friend Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a, sin hath overcome you--even according to your weakness, and according to your folly, and according to your unrighteousness--in that you brought without ground against Dabba the Mallian a charge of breach of morality. But since you, O friend Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a, look upon your sin as sin, and make amends for it as is meet, we do accept at your hands your confession of it. For this, O friend Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a, is the advantage of</p>

<p>the discipline of the noble one, that he who looks upon his sin as sin, and makes amends for it as is meet, he becomes able in future to restrain himself therefrom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>6. Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Let then the Sa<I>m</I>gha turn up the bowl again as regards Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi, and make him as one who has dealings with the Sa<I>m</I>gha.</p>  
<p>'There are eight things, O Bhikkhus, which when they characterise an Up&acirc;saka the bowl should be turned up again as regards him;--when he goes not about to bring loss of gifts on the Bhikkhus, when he goes not about to bring harm to the Bhikkhus, when he goes not about to cause the Bhikkhus to want a place of residence, when he reviles or slanders not the Bhikkhus, when he causes not divisions between Bhikkhus and Bhikkhus;--when he speaks not in dispraise of the Buddha;--when he speaks not in dispraise of the Dhamma;--when he speaks not in dispraise of the Sa<I>m</I>gha.</p>  
<p>7. 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is the bowl to be turned up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. That Va<I>d</I><I>dh</I>a the Li<I>k</I><I>kh</I>avi should go before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, with his upper robe arranged over one shoulder&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and squatting down, and raising</p>

<p>his hands with the palms joined together, should speak as follows:</p>  
<p>'"The bowl has been turned down against me, Sirs, by the Sa<I>m</I>gha, and I am become as one having no dealings with the Sa<I>m</I>gha.

<p>'And a second time he is to prefer the same request, and a third time he is to prefer the same request in the same words.</p>  
<p>'Then some discreet and able Bhikkhu should lay the matter before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, saying,</p>  
<p>'"Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me.

<P><A NAME="fn_308"></A><A HREF="sbe20035.htm#fr_314">118:1</A> These are two of the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus; and the evil deeds of the followers form the subject of <I>K</I>ullavagga IV, 4, 5 and following sections. Our sections 1, 2 are nearly the same as g 8, 9 there.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_309"></A><A HREF="sbe20035.htm#fr_315">119:1</A> See the note above on IV, 4, 9.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_310"></A><A HREF="sbe20035.htm#fr_316">119:2</A> Patta<I>m</I> nikku<I>g</I><I>g</I>atu. This phrase is used in the ordinary signification above, V, 9, 4. It is characteristic of the mildness of early Buddhism that this should be the only penalty imposed upon a layman. Compare H.O.'s remarks in his 'Buddha, sein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde,' pp. 391-393. The house of such a layman becomes then an ago<I>k</I>aro, 'an unlawful resort.' (<I>K</I>ullavagga VIII, 1, 2.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_311"></A><A HREF="sbe20035.htm#fr_317">120:1</A> Asambhoga<I>m</I> sa<I>m</I>ghena karotu. This phrase is used in regard to a Bhikkhu at <I>K</I>ullavagga I, 25, 1, as the distinctive mark of the Act of Suspension (Ukkhepaniya-kamma), and there means 'depriving him of his right to eat and dwell with the other Bhikkhus.' Sambhoge an&acirc;patti at Mah&acirc;vagga I, 79, 2 (at the end), means that it is not an offence for the Bhikkhus to eat and dwell together with a guilty Bhikkhu under certain conditions there specified. As an Up&acirc;saka never, under any circumstances, either eats or dwells together with the Bhikkhus (in P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya 5 the reference is to s&acirc;ma<I>n</I>eras), the meaning here must be to make him one who has no dealings with the Sa<I>m</I>gha, to withdraw his privilege of providing food or lodging for the Sa<I>m</I>gha. The sabho<I>g</I>ana<I>m</I> kula<I>m</I> in the 43rd P&acirc;<I>k</I>ittiya has probably nothing to do with this.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_312"></A><A HREF="sbe20035.htm#fr_318">120:2</A> When a Bhikkhu behaves towards the laity in any one of the first five of these eight ways the Pa<I>t</I>is&acirc;ra<I>n</I>iya-kamma is to be carried out against him--that is to say, he has to ask pardon of the layman against whom he has offended. See I, 20. The whole eight recur below, &sect; 6.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_314"></A><A HREF="sbe20035.htm#fr_320">122:1</A> This is precisely the expression made use of in the converse case, when a Bhikkhu has offended against the laity. See I, 22, 3.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_318"></A><A HREF="sbe20035.htm#fr_324">123:2</A> The following paragraphs are precisely the same as those in which the revocation of the Ta<I>g</I><I>g</I>aniya-kamma is described in the reverse case of a Bhikkhu, above, I, 8.</P>

Unless these words have been introduced by mistake from the corresponding passage in I, 8 (which is not probable), they show that the uttar&acirc;sa&#7749;ga (on which see the note on Mah&acirc;vagga VIII, 13, 4) was also worn by laymen. But this is the only passage known to <A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A> us in the earlier literature in which such a use of it is mentioned or implied. Compare Rh.
