<p>1. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus thinking, 'No one knows that we are guilty' listened to the P&acirc;timokkha. The Thera Bhikkhus, who understood the thoughts of other men, told the Bhikkhus, saying, 'Such and such a one, Sirs, and such and such a one, <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, thinking, "No one knows that we are guilty," are listening to the P&acirc;timokkha.'</p>  
<p>When the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus heard that, they, thinking 'the good Bhikkhus will (otherwise) first interdict the P&acirc;timokkha to us,' interdicted the P&acirc;timokkha to the Bhikkhus who were pure and innocent before (they had time to do so to them), and this without ground and without cause.</p>  
<p>Those Bhikkhus who were moderate murmured, &amp;c (as usual, down to) told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus have [acted thus]?'</p>  
<p>'It is true, Lord!'</p>  
<p>Then he rebuked them, and when he had delivered a religious discourse, he said: 'The P&acirc;timokkha is not, O Bhikkhus, to be interdicted to pure and innocent Bhikkhus without ground and without cause. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.</p>  
<p>2. 'There is one kind of inhibition of the P&acirc;timokkha, O Bhikkhus, which is illegal, and one</p>

<p>And which are the ten kinds of inhibition of the P&acirc;timokkha which are legal? [The same as the last, positive instead of negative.]</p>  
<p>4. 'And how (can it be legally said that) a Bhikkhu who has been guilty of a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence is seated in the assembly?</p>  
<p>'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu sees that (another) Bhikkhu is incurring a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence by those means, marks, and signs by which the incurring of a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence is brought about. Or in case a Bhikkhu does not himself see that (another) Bhikkhu is incurring a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence, but another Bhikkhu inform the (first-mentioned) Bhikkhu, saying, "Such and such a Bhikkhu, Sir, has been guilty of a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence." Or in case a Bhikkhu does not himself see that another Bhikkhu is incurring a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence, but that one himself inform the (first-mentioned) Bhikkhu, saying, "I, Sir, have been guilty of a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence."</p>  
<p>'(In either of these cases), O Bhikkhus, if he seem to do so, the Bhikkhu may, on the ground of what he has seen and heard and suspected, bring forward the following resolution on an Uposatha day, on the fourteenth or fifteenth day of the month, at a time when that individual is present in the midst of the Sa<I>m</I>gha: "Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. Such and such an individual has been guilty of a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence. I interdict for him the P&acirc;timokkha, to the effect that the P&acirc;timokkha ought not to be recited at a time when he is present." That is a legal inhibition of the P&acirc;timokkha.</p>  
<p>'If, when the P&acirc;timokkha his been inhibited for</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_312"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 312</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that Bhikkhu, the assembly should rise on account of any one or other of the Ten Dangers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_854"></A><A HREF="#fn_840"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--danger arising from the king, or from thieves, or from fire, or from water, or from human beings, or from non- human beings, or from beasts of prey, or from creeping things, or danger of life, or danger against chastity--the Bhikkhu may, if he desire to do so, bring forward the following resolution, either in that circle of residence or in another circle of residence, at a time when that individual is present in the midst of the assembly: "Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. A discussion had commenced with regard to a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence of such and such a person, but that matter was not decided. If the time seems meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha decide that matter." If he thus succeed, it is well. If not, then on an Uposatha day, on the fourteenth or fifteenth day of the month, at a time when that individual is present in the midst of the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let him bring forward the following resolution: "Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. A discussion had commenced with regard to a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence of such and such a person, but that matter was not decided. I interdict the P&acirc;timokkha for him to the effect that the P&acirc;timokkha ought not to be recited at a time when he is present." That is a legal inhibition of the P&acirc;timokkha.</p>  
<p>5. 'And how (can it be legally said that a Bhikkhu) who has abandoned the precepts is seated in the assembly?'</p>  
<p>[The same as last, reading 'abandoned the precepts,' &amp;c., for 'P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence,' &amp;c.]</p>  
<p>6. 'And how (can it be legally said that the person</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_313"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 313</FONT></A></p>  
<p>charged) does not submit himself to the legally (prescribed) concord (of the assembly)?'</p>  
<p>[Same as last, reading 'not submit himself to the legally (prescribed) concord of the assembly,' &amp;c., instead of 'abandon the precepts,' &amp;c.]</p>  
<p>7. 'And how (can it be legally said that the person charged) withdraws his acceptance of the legally (established) concord (of the assembly)?'</p>  
<p>[Same as last, reading 'withdraws his acceptance,' &amp;c., for 'does not submit,' &amp;c.]</p>  
<p>8. 'And how can it be legally said that the person charged has been seen or heard or suspected of having committed an offence against morality . . . . an offence against conduct . . . . an offence against doctrine?'</p>  
<p>[Same as 4, reading 'offence against morality,' &amp;c., for 'P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence.]</p>  
<p>These are the ten kinds of the inhibition of P&acirc;timokkha which are legal.</p>
