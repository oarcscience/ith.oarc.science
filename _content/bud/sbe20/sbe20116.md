### 25.

1\. Now at that time a certain woman who had already conceived, but did
not know it, was received into the Order among the Bhikkhunîs.
Afterwards her womb moved within her <span
id="fr_952"></span>[2](#fn_936). Then that Bhikkhunî thought: 'How shall
I now conduct myself towards this child?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow her, O Bhikkhus, to bring it up till it have attained to years
of discretion <span id="fr_953"></span>[3](#fn_937).'

Then the Bhikkhunî thought: 'It is not permissible for me to live alone,
nor for any other Bhikkhunî to live with a male child. What course ought
I to pursue?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow the Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, to depute any one Bhikkhunî, and
give her as a companion to that (first-mentioned) Bhikkhunî.'

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is she *t*o be appointed: First that Bhikkhunî
ought to be asked (whether she be willing to undertake the duty). After
she has been asked, a learned and competent Bhikkhunî ought to lay the
motion before the Sa*m*gha, saying:

'"Let the Sa*m*gha, venerable Ladies, hear me. If it seem meet to the
Sa*m*gha, let the Sa*m*gha depute N. N. as a companion to M. M. That is
the motion.

'"Let the Sa*m*gha,"' \[&c., as usual, to the end of the Kammavâ*k*â.\]

2\. Then that companion Bhikkhunî thought: 'Now how should I conduct
myself towards this child?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I prescribe that the Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, conduct themselves towards
that child precisely as they would towards other men, save only as
regards the sleeping under the same roof <span
id="fr_954"></span>[1](#fn_938).'

3\. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhunî, who had been guilty of a
grievous offence, was living subject to the Mânatta penance <span
id="fr_955"></span>[2](#fn_939). Then that Bhikkhunî thought: 'It is not
permissible for me to live alone, and it is not permissible for any
other Bhikkhunî to live with me. What now ought I to do?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

I allow the Bhikkhunîs, O Bhikkhus, to depute any one Bhikkhunî, and to
give her as a companion to that Bhikkhunî. And thus, O Bhikkhus, ought

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

she to be deputed \[&c., as in last section but one, down to the end of
the Kammavâ*k*â\].'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_936"></span>[364:2](sbe20116.htm#fr_952) There is a
touching story founded on a similar incident which is given as the
Introductory Story to No. 12 of the *G*âtakas, translated in Rh. D.'s
'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 199-205. By the 61st Bhikkhunî Pâ*k*ittiya
it is lawful or unlawful to initiate a pregnant woman according as she
is unconscious or conscious of the fact of her conception.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[364:3](sbe20116.htm#fr_953) Vi*ññ*utam
pâpu*n*âti. That is, no doubt, to puberty. Compare the opening phrases
of the Introductory Story referred to in the last note (*G*âtaka I, 231)
and also *G*âtaka III, 437.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[365:1](sbe20116.htm#fr_954) Sâgâra*m*; on
which Buddhaghosa has no note.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[365:2](sbe20116.htm#fr_955) For what this
implied, see *K*ullavagga II, 1, 2, and II, 6, 1, and compare the 5th
Garudhamma above, X, 1, 4.
