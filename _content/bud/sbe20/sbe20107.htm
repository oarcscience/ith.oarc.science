<p>1. Now at that time the Bhikkhus had come into the possession of some bedding, and the Bhikkhun&icirc;s had none. The Bhikkhun&icirc;s sent a messenger to the Bhikkhus, saying: 'It would be well if their reverences the Bhikkhus would give us some bedding on loan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_914"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to give bedding to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s on loan.'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time Bhikkhun&icirc;s, in their courses, sat down or lay down on stuffed bedsteads and chairs, and the stuffing was soiled with blood.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>A Bhikkhun&icirc; is not, O Bhikkhus, to sit down or lie down on a stuffed bedstead or chair. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow the use, O Bhikkhus, of an indoor's robe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_915"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>The indoor's robe got soiled.</p>

<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a thigh-cloth (a cloth to reach nearly down to the knee&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>).'</p>  
<p>The thigh-cloth slipped down.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow it, O Bhikkhus, to be fastened by a thread to be tied round the thigh.'</p>  
<p>The thread broke.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a loin-cloth, and a string going round the hips (to keep it up)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_917"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhun&icirc;s used to wear the hip-string always. The people murmured, &amp;c., saying: 'Like the women who still enjoy the pleasures of the world!' They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'A Bhikkhun&icirc; is not, O Bhikkhus, to wear a hip-string for constant use&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_918"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. I allow its use to one who is in her courses.'</p>

It is a wedge-shaped strip of cotton cloth about a foot and a half long, about five inches wide at one end, and tapering down to one inch in width at the other. The broad end is fixed on to a string going round the waist (<I>k</I>a<I>t</I>i-suttaka<I>m</I>), and hangs down, when put on, in front of the legs. When worn under other clothes, it remains so; but when the other clothes are taken off for work the narrow end is passed under the body between the legs, and twisted round the hip-string behind (at the small of the back) so as to keep it fast.
