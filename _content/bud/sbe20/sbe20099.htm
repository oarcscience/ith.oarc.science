<p>1. Now at that time a Bhikkhun&icirc;, a pupil of the Bhikkhun&icirc; Uppalava<I>n</I><I>n</I>&acirc;, followed the Blessed One for seven years, learning the Vinaya; but she, being forgetful, lost it as fast as she received it. And that Bhikkhun&icirc; heard that the Blessed One was about to go to S&acirc;vatthi. Then she thought: 'For seven years have I followed the Blessed One, learning the Vinaya; and, being forgetful, I have lost it as fast as I received it. Hard is it for a woman to follow the Blessed One her life long. What now shall I do?'</p>  
<p>And that Bhikkhun&icirc; told this matter to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s, and they told it to the Bhikkhus, and the Bhikkhus told it to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to teach the Vinaya to Bhikkhun&icirc;s.'</p>
