### 19.

1\. Now at that time a sheath of felt <span
id="fr_309"></span>[2](#fn_303) had come into the possession of the
Sa*m*gha.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, a sheath.'

The Bhikkhus considered whether a sheath was a thing which each one
might keep for himself, or a thing which ought to be handed over from
time to time by one Bhikkhu to another.'

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

'A sheath, O Bhikkhus, is neither to be appropriated nor to be handed
over <span id="fr_310"></span>[1](#fn_304).'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to eat lying on
decorated divans.

People murmured, &c saying, 'Like those still living in the pleasures of
the world.'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to eat lying on decorated divans <span
id="fr_311"></span>[2](#fn_305). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a
dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu was sick, and when eating he was not
able to hold his bowl in his hand.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a stand for the bowl <span
id="fr_312"></span>[3](#fn_306).'

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to eat out of one dish,
to drink out of one vessel, and to lie on one bed, one coverlet, or one
mat <span id="fr_313"></span>[4](#fn_307).

The people murmured, &c. . . . .

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, \[to do any of these things.\] Whosoever does
so, shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'
