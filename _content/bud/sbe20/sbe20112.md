### 21.

Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhunîs had themselves carried in
vehicles to which cows were yoked with a bull between them <span
id="fr_935"></span>[2](#fn_920), or bulls were yoked with a cow between
them. People were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying: 'That
is what is done at the feast of the Gaṅgâ, and the Mali <span
id="fr_936"></span>[2](#fn_920).'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'A Bhikkhunî is not, O Bhikkhus, to be carried in a vehicle. Whosoever
does so, shall be dealt with according to law <span
id="fr_937"></span>[3](#fn_921).'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhunî was sick, and unable to go on foot.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow the use of a carriage, O Bhikkhus, to a sick (Bhikkhunî) <span
id="fr_938"></span>[4](#fn_922).'

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

Now the Bhikkhunîs thought: 'Should the carts be yoked with cows or
bulls?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a cart yoked with cows or bulls, or drawn by
hand <span id="fr_939"></span>[1](#fn_923).'

Now at that time a certain Bhikkhunî was much distressed by the jolting
of the cart.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of a litter or sedan chair <span
id="fr_940"></span>[2](#fn_924).'
