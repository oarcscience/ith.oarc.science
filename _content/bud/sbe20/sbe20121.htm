<p>1. Now the Va<I>g</I><I>g</I>ian Bhikkhus of Ves&acirc;l&icirc; heard the rumour: 'Yasa, they say, the son of K&acirc;ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>aka, wishing to take this legal question in hand, is seeking about for support, and support they say he is succeeding in getting.' And they thought: 'This legal question, now, is hard and subtle. How can we obtain such support that we may have the greater power at the decision thereof&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1020"></A><A HREF="#fn_1002"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?'</p>  
<p>And they thought: 'The venerable Yasa, who dwells at Soreyya, is wise in the traditions, and is one who has learnt the Agamas, who knows by heart the Dhamma, the Vinaya, the M&acirc;tik&acirc;s, is intelligent, discreet, and wise, modest, conscientious, and devoted to the precepts. If we could gain him over to our side, we should attain our end.'</p>  
<p>Then the Va<I>g</I><I>g</I>ian Bhikkhus of Ves&acirc;l&icirc; got together much property, requisites, a number of things of the Sama<I>n</I>as' life--to wit, bowls and robes, and rugs, and needlecases, and girdles, and filters, and regulation-pots&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1021"></A><A HREF="#fn_1003"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And, taking this property with</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_401"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 401</FONT></A></p>  
<p>them, they went up stream by boat to Saha<I>g</I>&acirc;ti, and there disembarked, and took their meal at the foot of a certain tree.</p>  
<p>2. Now to the venerable S&acirc;<I>lh</I>a, who retired apart and was plunged in meditation, there occurred this doubtful problem: 'Are the Bhikkhus of the East, or the Bhikkhus of the West, the more in accordance with the Dhamma in the opinion that they hold?' And having gone over the Dhamma and the Vinaya in his mind, he came to the conclusion, 'The Bhikkhus of the East are not, and the Bhikkhus of the West are, in accordance with the Dhamma in the opinion that they hold.'</p>  
<p>And a certain one of the deities in the Pure Abode&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1022"></A><A HREF="#fn_1004"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> perceived how this doubtful problem had arisen in the venerable S&acirc;<I>lh</I>a's mind, and as quickly as a strong man could stretch forth his bent arm, or draw it in again when it was outstretched, so quickly did that deity vanish from the Pure Abode, and appeared before the venerable S&acirc;<I>lh</I>a; saying to him: 'Thou art quite right, S&acirc;<I>lh</I>a; it is the Eastern Bhikkhus whose opinions are against the Dhamma, and the Western Bhikkhus whose opinions accord therewith. Do thou, therefore, O S&acirc;<I>lh</I>a, even as the Dhamma is, so take thy stand!'</p>  
<p>'Both formerly, O deity, and now, also, do I take my stand even as the Dhamma is. Notwithstanding, I shall not make manifest my opinion until (the Sa<I>m</I>gha) shall have appointed me (judge) over this question&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1023"></A><A HREF="#fn_1005"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>3. Now the Va<I>g</I><I>g</I>ian Bhikkhus of Ves&acirc;l&icirc;, taking with them the aforesaid property, went to the place</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_402"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 402</FONT></A></p>  
<p>where the venerable Revata was, and said to him: 'Let the venerable Thera receive at our hands these requisites of a Sama<I>n</I>a's life.'</p>  
<p>But he refused to receive it, saying, 'Not so, my friends. I have all the things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1024"></A><A HREF="#fn_1006"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I want.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time a Bhikkhu named Uttara, who had been twenty years admitted into the Order&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1025"></A><A HREF="#fn_1007"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, was the attendant upon the venerable Revata. And the Va<I>g</I><I>g</I>ian Bhikkhus of Ves&acirc;l&icirc; went to him, and said: 'Let your reverence receive at our hands these requisites of a Sama<I>n</I>a's life.'</p>  
<p>But he made the same reply.</p>  
<p>Then they said: 'People used to offer such requisites to the Blessed One. If he received them, they were happy. If he did not receive them, they used to offer them to the venerable &Acirc;nanda, saying, "Let the venerable Thera receive these requisites of a Sama<I>n</I>a's life: that will be just as if the Blessed One had received them." Let the venerable Uttara receive these things: that will be as if the Thera had received them.'</p>  
<p>Then the venerable Uttara, being thus importuned by the Va<I>g</I><I>g</I>ian Bhikkhus of Ves&acirc;l&icirc;, accepted one robe, saying, 'You may tell me, friends, what you want.'</p>  
<p>'Let the venerable Uttara say thus much for us to the Thera: "Let the venerable Thera say thus much in the meeting of the Sa<I>m</I>gha--'It is in the regions of the East that the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, are born. It is the Bhikkhus of the East who hold opinions in accord with the Dhamma, whereas the Bhikkhus of the West do not.'"'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_403"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 403</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Even so, Sirs,' said the venerable Uttara, in assent to the Va<I>g</I><I>g</I>ian Bhikkhus of Ves&acirc;l&icirc;. And he went to Revata, and told him what they had said.</p>  
<p>'Thou urgest me, O Bhikkhu, to that which is against the Dhamma,' said the Thera, and sent away the venerable Uttara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1026"></A><A HREF="#fn_1008"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>And the Va<I>g</I><I>g</I>ian Bhikkhus of Ves&acirc;l&icirc; said to the venerable Uttara: 'What, fiend Uttara, did the Thera say?'</p>  
<p>'It is an evil you have wrought me, Sirs. The Thera has sent me away, saying, "Thou urgest me, O Bhikkhu, to what is against the Dhamma."'</p>  
<p>'Are you not, Sir, of full age, of twenty years (since your upasampad&acirc;)?'</p>  
<p>'Yes, Sirs, I am.'</p>  
<p>'Then do we take the nissaya under you as your pupils&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1027"></A><A HREF="#fn_1009"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>4. Now the Sa<I>m</I>gha met together with the intention of deciding the legal question. And the venerable Revata laid a resolution before the Sa<I>m</I>gha, saying,</p>  
<p>'Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. If we were to settle this question, it might be that those Bhikkhus who had at first taken the matter in hand might raise it again&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1028"></A><A HREF="#fn_1010"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha settle it at that place where it arose.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_404"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 404</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Then the Thera Bhikkhus went to Ves&acirc;l&icirc;, with the intention of settling the matter there.</p>  
<p>Now at that time the eldest Thera in the world, Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc; by name, one who was of a hundred and twenty years' standing from the date of his upasampad&acirc;, and who had been a pupil&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1029"></A><A HREF="#fn_1011"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the venerable &Acirc;nanda, was living at Ves&acirc;l&icirc;. And the venerable Revata said to the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta S&acirc;<I>n</I>av&acirc;s&icirc;:</p>  
<p>'I shall go to that Vih&acirc;ra in which the Thera Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc; dwells. Do you go betimes to the venerable Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc;, and question him as touching these ten points.'</p>  
<p>'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta S&acirc;<I>n</I>av&acirc;s&icirc;, in assent to the venerable Revata.</p>  
<p>And the venerable Revata came to that Vih&acirc;ra in which the venerable Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc; lived; and a sleeping-place was made ready for the former in the inner chamber, and for the latter in front thereof. And the venerable Revata, thinking, 'This Thera, though so old, does not care to sleep,' did not go to rest. And the venerable Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc;, thinking, 'This Bhikkhu, though a traveller and tired, does not care to sleep,' did not go to rest.</p>  
<p>5. Then when the night was far spent, the venerable Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc; said to the venerable Revata:</p>  
<p>'By what manner of life, beloved one, have you lived now these so many years?'</p>  
<p>'By continuing in the sense of love, honoured friend, have I continued thus so many years.'</p>  
<p>'They say that you have continued thus, beloved one, by easiness of life: and that indeed, beloved one, is an easy life, (I mean) the continuing in love.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_405"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 405</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Even long ago, Sir, when I was a layman, was much love laid up in my heart, therefore is it that now also I live much in the sense of love, and indeed since long I have attained to Arahatship. And by what manner of life have you lived now these many years?'</p>  
<p>'By continuing in the sense of the emptiness (of worldly things) have I, beloved one, lived these many years.'</p>  
<p>'They say that you, honoured friend, have continued thus by the sense of being a man born to greatness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1030"></A><A HREF="#fn_1012"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and that indeed, honoured friend, is the same feeling, (I mean) the sense of the emptiness of things.'</p>  
<p>'Even long ago, beloved one, when I was a layman, had I a strong sense of the emptiness of things, therefore is it that now also I live much in that feeling, and indeed since long I have attained to Arahatship.'</p>  
<p>6. Now&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1031"></A><A HREF="#fn_1013"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> this conversation between the Thera Bhikkhus was still unfinished when the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta S&acirc;<I>n</I>av&acirc;s&icirc; arrived there. And he went up to the venerable Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc;, and saluted him, and took his seat beside him. And, so seated, he said to the venerable Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc;:</p>  
<p>'These Va<I>g</I><I>g</I>ian Bhikkhus of Ves&acirc;l&icirc; have put forth in Ves&acirc;l&icirc; these ten points;' and he told them all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1032"></A><A HREF="#fn_1014"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 'Now you, O Thera, have mastered much Dhamma and Vinaya at the feet of your preceptor.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_406"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 406</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> What, then, is the conclusion to which you, O Thera, come as you lay over in your mind the Dhamma and the Vinaya;--whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma, that of the Bhikkhus of the East, or that of the Bhikkhus of the West?'</p>  
<p>'You also, Sir, have mastered much Dhamma and Vinaya at the feet of your preceptor. What, then, is the conclusion to which you, Sir, come as you lay over in your mind the Dhamma and the Vinaya;--whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma, that of the Bhikkhus of the East, or that of the Bhikkhus of the West?'</p>  
<p>'The conclusion to which I come, Lord, as I so lay over in my mind the Dhamma and the Vinaya, is this--that the Bhikkhus of the East hold an opinion that is not in accord with the Dhamma, while the Bhikkhus of the West are in accord with the Dhamma. Notwithstanding, I do not intend to make manifest my opinion until (the Sa<I>m</I>gha) shall have appointed me (referee) over this question&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1033"></A><A HREF="#fn_1015"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>'The conclusion to which I also have come, Sir, as I lay over in my mind the Dhamma and the Vinaya, is this--that the Bhikkhus of the East hold an opinion that is not in accordance with the Dhamma, while the Bhikkhus of the West are in accord with the Dhamma. Notwithstanding, I do not intend to make manifest my opinion until (the Sa<I>m</I>gha) shall have appointed me (referee) over this question.'</p>  
<p>7. Then the Sa<I>m</I>gha met together with the intention of enquiring into this legal question. But while they were enquiring into it, both was much pointless speaking brought forth and also the sense</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_407"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 407</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in no single speech was clear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1034"></A><A HREF="#fn_1016"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Then the venerable Revata laid a resolution before the Sa<I>m</I>gha:</p>  
<p>'Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. Whilst we are discussing this legal question, there is both much pointless speaking, and no sense is clear in any single speech. If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha settle this legal question by referring it (to a jury)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1035"></A><A HREF="#fn_1017"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>And he chose four Bhikkhus of the East and four Bhikkhus of the West--from the Bhikkhus of the East the venerable Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc;, and the venerable S&acirc;<I>lh</I>a, and the venerable Khu<I>g</I><I>g</I>a-sobhita, and the venerable V&acirc;sabha-g&acirc;mika--and from the Bhikkhus of the West, the venerable Revata, and the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta S&acirc;<I>n</I>av&acirc;s&icirc;, and the venerable Yasa, the son of K&acirc;ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>aka, and the venerable Sumana. Then the venerable Revata laid a resolution before the Sa<I>m</I>gha:</p>  
<p>'Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. During the enquiry into this matter there has been much pointless talk among us, and in no single utterance is the sense clear. If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, let the Sa<I>m</I>gha delegate four Bhikkhus of the East and four Bhikkhus of the West to settle this question by reference. This is the resolution.</p>  
<p>'Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. During the enquiry into this matter there has been much pointless talk among us, and the sense in any single utterance is not clear. The Sa<I>m</I>gha delegates four Bhikkhus of the East and four Bhikkhus of the West to settle this question by reference. Whosoever</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_408"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 408</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the venerable ones approves thereof, let him keep silence. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak. The delegation is made accordingly. The Sa<I>m</I>gha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time a Bhikkhu named A<I>g</I>ita, of ten years' standing, was the reciter of the P&acirc;timokkha to the Sa<I>m</I>gha. Him did the Sa<I>m</I>gha appoint as seat regulator&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1036"></A><A HREF="#fn_1018"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to the Thera Bhikkhus.</p>  
<p>Then the Thera Bhikkhus thought, 'At what place, now, ought we to settle this legal question?' And it occurred to them: 'This V&acirc;lika &Acirc;r&acirc;ma is a pleasant place, quiet and undisturbed. Let us settle the matter there.' And thither the Thera Bhikkhus proceeded to enquire into the question.</p>  
<p>8. Then the venerable Revata laid a resolution before the Sa<I>m</I>gha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1037"></A><A HREF="#fn_1019"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: 'Let the venerable Sa<I>m</I>gha hear me. If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, I will question the venerable Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc; as touching the Vinaya.' And the venerable Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc; laid a resolution before the Sa<I>m</I>gha: 'If it seem meet to the Sa<I>m</I>gha, I, when asked by Revata touching the Vinaya, will give reply.'</p>  
<p>And the venerable Revata said to the venerable Sabbak&acirc;m&icirc;: 'Is the horn-salt-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_409"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 409</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'What, Sir, is this horn-salt-license?'</p>  
<p>'Is it allowable, Lord, to carry about salt in a horn with the intention of putting it into food which has not been salted?'</p>  
<p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>  
<p>'Where was such a claim rejected?'</p>  
<p>'At S&acirc;vatthi, in the Sutta Vibha&#7749;ga.'</p>

<p>'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>
