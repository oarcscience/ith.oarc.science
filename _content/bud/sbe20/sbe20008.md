1\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus carried out official
acts against Bhikkhus who had not confessed themselves guilty--the
Ta*gg*aniya-kamma, or the Nissaya-kamma, or the Pabbâ*g*aniya-kamma, or
the Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-kamma, or the Ukkhepaniya-kamma.

Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed, murmured, and became
indignant, saying, 'How can the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus (&c., as
before).' And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.

'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus do so?'

'It is true, Lord.'

Then he rebuked them, and when he had delivered a religious discourse,
he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:

No official act, O Bhikkhus,--whether the Ta*gg*aniya-kamma, or the
Nissaya-kamma, or the Pabbâ*g*aniya-kamma, or the
Pa*t*isâra*n*iya-kamma, or the Ukkhepaniya-kamma,--is to be carried out
against Bhikkhus who have not confessed themselves guilty <span

dukka*t*a offence.'
