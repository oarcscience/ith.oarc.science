### 14.

1\. Now at that time Visâkhâ the mother of Migâra was anxious to have a
storeyed building (pâsâda), with a verandah (âlinda) to it, supported on
pillars with capitals of elephant head <span
id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_586), built for the use of the Sa*m*gha. Then
the Bhikkhus thought, 'Of things which appertain to a storeyed building,
which has been permitted by the Blessed One, and which not <span
id="fr_597"></span>[2](#fn_587)?'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the use of all appurtenances to a storeyed
building.'

Now at that time the grandmother of Pasenadi of Kosala had died, and
many unauthorised things had come into the hands of the Sa*m*gha, such
as couches, divans (&c., as in chapter 8 above, and Mahâvagga V, 10, 4).

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use the stuffed couches (âsandi) after
having broken off the legs <span id="fr_598"></span>[1](#fn_588), and
the divans (pallaṅka) after having removed the hair, and to comb out the
cotton of the mat-tresses and make pillows of it <span
id="fr_599"></span>[2](#fn_589), and to use all the rest as floor
covering <span id="fr_600"></span>[3](#fn_590).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_586"></span>[208:1](sbe20066.htm#fr_596) Hatthi-nakhaka*m*,
'supported on the frontal globes (kumbhe) of elephants,' says
Buddhaghosa.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[208:2](sbe20066.htm#fr_597) On the meaning of
paribhoga here compare VI, 18, 1. The doubt here expressed is curious,
as a storeyed building (pâsâda) is one of the five kinds of abodes
(lenâni) specially sanctioned by Mahâvagga I, 30, 4, and *K*ullavagga
VI, 1, 2; and a verandah (âlinda) has been also authorised by
*K*ullavagga VI, 3, 5. No doubt the special point here is as to the
carved pillars: but, even so, that this rule should be thus separated
from the other rules as to buildings, in the commencement of this book
(VI, 1-4), is a proof of the unsystematic way in which the Khandhakas
have been put together. Even the final redaction which we have now
before us contains much similar evidence of the gradual growth of these
rules. See note 3 on the next paragraph.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[209:1](sbe20066.htm#fr_598) Compare the 87th
Pâ*k*ittiya.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[209:2](sbe20066.htm#fr_599) This rule has
already been given in VI, 2, 6.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[209:3](sbe20066.htm#fr_600) It is distinctly
laid down without any reservation in Mahâvagga V, 10, 5 (in the
paragraph erroneously numbered V, 10, 4 in vol. ii, p. 28, of the
present work), that the use of any of these things is a dukka*t*a
offence. That this relaxation of that rule should be inserted only here,
looks very much like an after-thought, even though the former passage
merely refers to the use of these things as seats. This is more.
especially noteworthy from the fact mentioned in the last note.

The rules as to new rugs or mats to be used for sitting upon, are
contained in the 11th to the 15th Nissaggiya Pâ*k*ittiyas.
