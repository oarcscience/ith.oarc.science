<p>the dust out in the open space&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_830"></A><A HREF="#fn_816"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to windward of them, and covered the Bhikkhus (who were at work) with dust.</p>  
<p>The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &amp;c. . . . . told the Blessed One, &amp;c. . . . . and he said to the Bhikkhus:</p>  
<p>'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I establish a rule of conduct for the Bhikkhus in respect of lodging-places, according to which they are to behave themselves in respect thereof.</p>  
<p>2. 'In whatever Vih&acirc;ra he is staying, if that Vih&acirc;ra is dirty, he should, if he can, make it clean. When cleaning the Vih&acirc;ra, he should first take out his bowl and his robe and the mat used for sitting upon, and the bolster and . pillows, and put them down on one side. Taking the bed-frame down (from its stand), he should carry it out [and so on as in VIII, 1, 2, down to the end]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_831"></A><A HREF="#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>'He should not beat the bedding to get the dust out close to the Bhikkhus, or to the Vih&acirc;ra, or to the drinking-water, or to the water for washing, or in the open space (in front of the Vih&acirc;ra) to wind-ward of it or the Bhikkhus, but to leeward.</p>

<p>4. 'If he is dwelling in the same Vih&acirc;ra with an older (Bhikkhu), no recitation should be given, nor examination held, nor exhortation made, nor Dhamma spoken&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_832"></A><A HREF="#fn_818"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (to a pupil), without leave being asked of the senior. Nor should a lamp be lighted or extinguished, nor the lattices opened or closed, without his leave.</p>  
<p>'If he is walking up and down on the same <I>K</I>a&#7749;kama with an older (Bhikkhu), then he should turn back at the spot where his senior turns back; and he should not touch his senior even with the corner of his robe.</p>  
<p>'This, O Bhikkhus, is the rule of conduct, that I lay down for the Bhikkhus in respect of lodging-places, according to which they are to behave themselves therein.'</p>

This is not 'courtyard,' as Childers renders it, but a part of the &Acirc;r&acirc;ma, immediately in front of the hut or Vih&acirc;ra, which is kept as an, open space, and daily swept. The Sinhalese name for it is midula; there those who sleep in the hut spend the greater part of the day, and not even grass is allowed to grow upon it. The term is a very common one, and its meaning is not doubtful. Compare the <I>G</I>&acirc;taka book, I, 124, 151, 421; II, 249, 250, 345. Eka&#7749;gana<I>m</I> bhavati, at ibid. I, 53, 12, is to become one open space, as eka&#7749;gana<I>m</I> karoti at II, 357, is to clear a forest, and turn it into an open space.</P>
