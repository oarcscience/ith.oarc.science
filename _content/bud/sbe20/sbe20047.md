### 32.

1\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus set the woods on fire.

People murmured, &c., saying, 'Like the charcoal burners.'

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to set woods on fire. Whosoever does so, shall
be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time the Vihâras were hidden under masses of grass <span
id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_403), and when the woods were set on fire the
Vihâras were burnt. The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not make a
counter-fire for their own protection.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus. when the woods are

on fire to make a counter-fire <span id="fr_412"></span>[1](#fn_404),
and thus afford yourselves protection.'

2\. Now at that time the *Kh*abbaggiya Bhikkhus climbed up trees, and
jumped from tree to tree.

People murmured, &c., saying, 'Like monkeys.

They told this matter to the Blessed One.

'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to climb up trees. Whosoever does so, shall be
guilty of a dukka*t*a.'

Now at that time, when a certain Bhikkhu in the Kosala country was going
to Sâvatthi, an elephant pursued him on the way. And that Bhikkhu, when
he had run up to the foot of a tree, fearing to offend, did not climb
up. The elephant passed on another way.

That Bhikkhu, on arriving at Sâvatthi, told this matter to the Bhikkhus
(and the Bhikkhus told this matter to the Blessed One <span
id="fr_413"></span>[2](#fn_405)).

'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, when there shall be something to be done to
ascend a tree to the height of a man; and in cases of misfortune as high
as you like.'
