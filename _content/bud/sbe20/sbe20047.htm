<p>1. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus set the woods on fire.</p>  
<p>People murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like the charcoal burners.'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to set woods on fire. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Vih&acirc;ras were hidden under masses of grass&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_411"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and when the woods were set on fire the Vih&acirc;ras were burnt. The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not make a counter-fire for their own protection.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus. when the woods are</p>

<p>on fire to make a counter-fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_412"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and thus afford yourselves protection.'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus climbed up trees, and jumped from tree to tree.</p>  
<p>People murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like monkeys.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to climb up trees. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time, when a certain Bhikkhu in the Kosala country was going to S&acirc;vatthi, an elephant pursued him on the way. And that Bhikkhu, when he had run up to the foot of a tree, fearing to offend, did not climb up. The elephant passed on another way.</p>  
<p>That Bhikkhu, on arriving at S&acirc;vatthi, told this matter to the Bhikkhus (and the Bhikkhus told this matter to the Blessed One&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_413"></A><A HREF="#fn_405"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>).</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, when there shall be something to be done to ascend a tree to the height of a man; and in cases of misfortune as high as you like.'</p>
