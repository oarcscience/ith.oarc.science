### 3.

1\. Now Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî went up to the place where the
venerable Ânanda was, and bowed down before him, and stood respectfully
on one side.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And, so standing,
Mahâ-pa*g*âpatî the Gotamî said to the venerable Ânanda: 'One thing,
Ânanda, would I ask of the Blessed One. It were well, Sir, if the
Blessed One would allow the making of salutations, the rising up in
presence of another, the paying of reverence, and the performance of
proper duties one towards another, to take place as between both
Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunîs (equally) according to seniority.'

And the venerable Ânanda went to the Blessed One \[and repeated her
words to him\].

'This is impossible, Ânanda, and unallowable, that I should so order.
Even those others, Ânanda, teachers of ill doctrine, allow not such
conduct towards women; how much less, then, can the Tathâgata allow it?'

And the Blessed One, on that occasion, having delivered a religious
discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'You are not, O Bhikkhus,
to bow down before women, to rise up in their presence, to stretch out
your joined hands towards them, nor to perform towards them those duties
that are proper (from an inferior to a superior). Whosoever does so,
shall be guilty of a dukka*t*a.'
