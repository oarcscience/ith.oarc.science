### 15.

1\. Now at that time the Bhikkhus who dwelt in a certain country
residence, not far from Sâvatthi, were worried by having constantly to
provide sleeping accommodation for travelling Bhikkhus who came in (from
country-places). And those Bhikkhus

thought: '\[This being so,\] let us hand over all the sleeping
accommodation which is the property of the Sa*m*gha to one (of us), and
let us use it as belonging to him.' And they \[did so <span

Then the incoming Bhikkhus said to them: 'Prepare, Sirs, sleeping
accommodation for us.'

'There are no beds, Sirs, belonging to the Sa*m*gha. We have given them
all away to one of us.'

'What, Sirs? Have you then made away with property belonging to the
Sa*m*gha?'

'That is so, Sirs.'

The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &c., and told this matter to the Blessed
One.

'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, .as they say, that Bhikkhus make away with
Sa*m*gha property?'

'It is true, Lord.'

2\. Then the Blessed One rebuked them, &c., and said to the Bhikkhus:
'These five things, O Bhikkhus, are untransferable; and are not to be
disposed of either by the Sa*m*gha, or by a company of two or three
Bhikkhus (a Ga*n*a), or by a single individual. And what are the five? A
park (Ârâma), or the site for a park--this is the first untransferable
thing, that cannot be disposed of by the Sa*m*gha, or by a Ga*n*a, or by
an individual. If it be disposed of, such disposal is void; and
whosoever has disposed of it, is guilty of a thulla*kk*aya. A Vihâra, or
the site for a Vihâra--this is the second, &c. (as before). A bed, or a
chair, or a bolster, or a -pillow--this is the third, &c. A brass
vessel, or a brass jar, or a brass pot, or a brass vase, or a razor, or
an axe, or a

hatchet, or a hoe, or a spade--this is the fourth, &c. Creepers, or
bamboos, or mu*ñg*a, or babba*g*a grass, or common grass, or clay, or
things made of wood, or crockery--this is the fifth, &c. (as before,
down to) thulla*kk*aya.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_591"></span>[210:1](sbe20067.htm#fr_601) This is a direct
infringement of the 82nd Pâ*k*ittiya, which forbids property dedicated
to the Sa*m*gha being diverted to the use of any individual.
