<p>2. 'There are three things, O Bhikkhus, by which, when a Tassa-p&acirc;piyyasik&acirc;-kamma is characterised, it is against the Dhamma, and against the Vinaya, and difficult to be settled; (that is to say), when it has not been carried out in a full assembly of properly qualified persons, according to law and justice, and in the presence of the litigant parties--when it has been carried out without the accused person having been heard--when it has been carried out without the accused person having confessed himself guilty.</p>
