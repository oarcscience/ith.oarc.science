<p>1. 'Now, O Bhikkhus, an official act carried out against a Bhikkhu who has confessed himself guilty is invalid as follows, and is valid as follows. And how does such an official act become invalid? In case a Bhikkhu have committed a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika offence, and in respect thereof either the Sa<I>m</I>gha, or a number of Bhikkhus, or a single Bhikkhu warns him, saying, "The venerable one has been guilty of a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika." And he replies thus, "I have not, Sirs, been guilty of a P&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>ika. I have been guilty of a Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa." And in respect thereof the Sa<I>m</I>gha deals with him for a Sa<I>m</I>gh&acirc;disesa. Then that official act is invalid.'</p>
