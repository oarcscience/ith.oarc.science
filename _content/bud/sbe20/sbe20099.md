### 8.

1\. Now at that time a Bhikkhunî, a pupil of the Bhikkhunî
Uppalava*nn*â, followed the Blessed One for seven years, learning the
Vinaya; but she, being forgetful, lost it as fast as she received it.
And that Bhikkhunî heard that the Blessed One was about to go to
Sâvatthi. Then she thought: 'For seven years have I followed the Blessed
One, learning the Vinaya; and, being forgetful, I have lost it as fast
as I received it. Hard is it for a woman to follow the Blessed One her
life long. What now shall I do?'

And that Bhikkhunî told this matter to the Bhikkhunîs, and they told it
to the Bhikkhus, and the Bhikkhus told it to the Blessed One.

'I allow Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhus, to teach the Vinaya to Bhikkhunîs.'
