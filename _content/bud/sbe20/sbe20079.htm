<p>1. Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at S&acirc;vatthi, in An&acirc;tha Pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ika's &Acirc;r&acirc;ma.</p>  
<p>Now at that time incoming Bhikkhus entered the &Acirc;r&acirc;ma with their sandals on&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_757"></A><A HREF="#fn_743"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, or with sunshades held up over them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_758"></A><A HREF="#fn_744"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, or with their heads muffled up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_759"></A><A HREF="#fn_745"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, or with their upper robe carried in a bundle on their heads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_760"></A><A HREF="#fn_746"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; and they washed their feet in the drinking-water; and they did not salute resident Bhikkhus senior to them, nor ask them where they (the incomers) should sleep.</p>  
<p>And a certain incoming Bhikkhu undid the bolt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_761"></A><A HREF="#fn_747"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of an unoccupied room (Vih&acirc;ra), and opened the door&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_762"></A><A HREF="#fn_748"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and so entered by force; and a snake fell</p>

<p>The Bhikkhus, running up, asked him why he did so. He told them that matter. Then those Bhikkhus who were moderate in their desires were vexed and indignant, and murmured, saying, 'How can incoming Bhikkhus enter the &Acirc;r&acirc;ma . . . .? (&amp;c., as before, down to) . . . . where they should sleep&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_765"></A><A HREF="#fn_751"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>They told the matter to the Blessed One (&amp;c., as usual, I, 1, 2, 3, down to) he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said, 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I establish a rule of conduct for incoming Bhikkhus, according to which they ought to behave.</p>

<p>'When he enters the &Acirc;r&acirc;ma he ought to notice where the resident Bhikkhus are gone to; and whithersoever they are gone--whether to the service hall, or to the portico (ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>apa), or to the foot of a tree--thither he ought to go, and laying his bowl on one side, and his robe on one side, he ought to take a suitable seat, and sit down.</p>  
<p>'He ought to ask as to the drinking-water, and the water for washing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_768"></A><A HREF="#fn_754"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, which is appropriated to the one use, and which to the other. If he has need of drinking-water, he ought to fetch it and drink. If he has need of water for washing, he ought to fetch it, and wash his feet. In washing his feet he ought to pour the water over them with one hand, and wash them with the other; he ought not to pour the water over them and wash them with one and the same hand.</p>

<p>'If the resident Bhikkhu be senior, he ought to be saluted; if junior, he ought to be made to salute (the incomer). The incomer ought to ask as to the lodging-place, which has fallen (to his lot)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_770"></A><A HREF="#fn_756"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and whether it is occupied or unoccupied. He ought to ask as to lawful and unlawful resorts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_771"></A><A HREF="#fn_757"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and as to what families have been officially declared to be in want&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_772"></A><A HREF="#fn_758"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_771"></A><A HREF="sbe20079.htm#fr_785">277:2</A> Samma<I>g</I><I>g</I>ati is to sweep (not to scrub), as is apparent from Mah&acirc;vagga VI, 34, I.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_772"></A><A HREF="sbe20079.htm#fr_786">277:3</A> &Ucirc;ha<I>&ntilde;</I><I>&ntilde;</I>i. So also at Mah&acirc;vagga I, 25, 15. At Mah&acirc;vagga I, 49, 4, we should have rendered 'defiled their beds' instead of 'threw their bedding about,' correcting uhananti of the text there into &ucirc;hadanti. &Ucirc;han (originally 'to throw up,' 'raise,' &amp;c.) seems, like sam&ucirc;han, to have acquired the meaning of to destroy, injure, spoil. From this meaning of spoiling, &ucirc;han evidently came to be used for, or confounded in the MS. with, &ucirc;had, 'to defile (with excrement).' So the phrase '&ucirc;hananti pi ummihanti pi' (at Mah&acirc;vagga I, 49, 4) exactly corresponds in meaning to 'omuttenti pi &ucirc;hadayanti pi' in Dhammapada, p. 283. There are other passages showing the same confusion. (1) The gerund, &ucirc;ha<I>k</I><I>k</I>a, which occurs in <I>G</I>&acirc;taka II, p. 71 ('id&acirc;ni kho (ahan) ta<I>m</I> &ucirc;ha<I>k</I><I>k</I>a'), is explained by the commentator to mean 'va<I>k</I><I>k</I>an te s&icirc;se katva.' (2) &ucirc;hanti, in G&acirc;taka II, p. 73 ('aggihutta<I>&ntilde;</I> <I>k</I>a &ucirc;hanti, tena bhinn&acirc; kama<I>n</I><I>d</I>al&ucirc;ti'), must mean the same and be = &ucirc;hadeti. For the monkey here referred to is said to have been guilty of the following dirty trick:--'ku<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&acirc; bhindati, aggis&acirc;l&acirc;ya va<I>k</I><I>k</I>a<I>m</I> karoti.' (3) mutteti ohaneti at <I>K</I>ariy&acirc; Pi<I>t</I>aka II, 5, 4, represents u<I>k</I><I>k</I>&acirc;ra-pas&acirc;vam katv&acirc; at <I>G</I>&acirc;taka II, 385. In the first of these passages uha<I>k</I><I>k</I>a may well be a copyist's blunder, arising from the similarity of the words, for uha<I>g</I><I>g</I>a. Dr. Morris, to whom we owe the comparison of these passages and the suggested emendation of Mah&acirc;vagga I, 49, 4, is rather of opinion that the words were confounded by the writers. For it is not an uncommon thing to find two words, not very remote in form or meaning, confounded together. It is well known that the English word livelihood properly and originally meant 'liveliness,' and has only afterwards replaced the earlier livelode, to which the sense of livelihood properly belongs. And something of this kind <A NAME="page_278"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 278</FONT></A> must have occurred, he thinks&#8222;in P&acirc;li in the use of &ucirc;han for it had. The past participle &ucirc;hata occurs at <I>K</I>ullavagga VIII, 10, 3.</P></P>

The use of this word here constitutes the only variation between our passage and that in the Mah&acirc;vagga I, 25 = below, VIII, 7, 2, where it is replaced by yath&acirc;<I>t</I><I>th</I>&acirc;ne or yath&acirc;pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>&ntilde;</I>atta<I>m</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_775"></A><A HREF="sbe20079.htm#fr_789">278:3</A> This passage throws a welcome light on the meaning of ma<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a and p&icirc;<I>th</I>a: for as they were to be beaten to get the dust out, it is clear that they were upholstered. The ma<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a, or bed, must have been a wooden framework, stuffed (probably with cotton), covered at the top with cotton cloth, and made underneath and at the sides of wood. It had no legs fixed to it, but was supported on movable tressels--the pa<I>t</I>ip&acirc;dak&acirc;. When using it, the sleeper covered it with a mat, or a cotton sheet, and had over him a coverlet of some kind; and these articles, which he would also use if he slept on the ground, constituted, together with the bolster and pillows, the sen&acirc;sana<I>m</I> or bedding,--that is, in the more special and limited use of that term (as, for instance, above, &sect; 3, and perhaps below, 7, 1). In its larger sense the same word is used, putting the part for the whole, for the whole sleeping apparatus, and is nearly equivalent to seyy&acirc;yo (so, for instance, in VI, 11 and 12, and below, VIII, 2, I; 6, 2 and perhaps VIII, 7, 1; whereas the latter term is used in the same connection at VI, 6, <A NAME="page_279"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 279</FONT></A> and VI, II, 3). Sayana, in VI, 8, is a generic term including bed, couch, sofa, and divan, but probably with special reference to these three latter things used in the day-time.</P>
