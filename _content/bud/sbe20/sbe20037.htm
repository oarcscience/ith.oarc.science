<p>1. Now when the Blessed One had remained at Bhagg&acirc; as long as he thought fit, he set out on his journey towards S&acirc;vatthi. And journeying straight on he arrived in due course at S&acirc;vatthi, and there, at S&acirc;vatthi, he stayed in the <I>G</I>etavana, in the &Acirc;r&acirc;ma of An&acirc;tha-pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ika.</p>  
<p>Now Vis&acirc;kh&acirc; the mother of Mig&acirc;ra, bringing small jars&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and earthenware foot-scrubbers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and brooms, went up to the place where the Blessed One was; and when she had come there, she saluted the Blessed One, and took her seat on one side. And so sitting, Vis&acirc;kh&acirc; the mother of Mig&acirc;ra said to the Blessed One, 'May the Blessed One accept these things at my hands, that that may be to me for long for a blessing and a joy.' And the Blessed One accepted the small jars and the brooms; but the Blessed One did not accept the earthenware foot-scrubbers.</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One instructed (&amp;c., as usual, see 21. 2, down to) she departed thence. And the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, after having delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, small jars and brooms. You are not, O Bhikkhus, to make use of earthen-ware foot-scrubbers. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, three kinds of things to rub the feet with--to wit, sandstone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, gravel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and sea-foam&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_331"></A><A HREF="sbe20037.htm#fr_337">130:2</A> Gha<I>t</I>aka<I>m</I>. At <I>G</I>&acirc;taka I, 32 this word seems to mean the capital of a pillar. We have taken it as the diminutive of gha<I>t</I>a, especially as Buddhaghosa says nothing; but this is doubtful.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_332"></A><A HREF="sbe20037.htm#fr_338">130:3</A> Kataka<I>m</I>. To the note quoted at p. 318 of the text, which shows that this is a kind of foot-rubber, Buddhaghosa adds that this article is forbidden b&acirc;hulik&acirc;nuyogatt&acirc;. This injunction is repeated below at V, 37, where kataka is mentioned as a kind of earthenware.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_333"></A><A HREF="sbe20037.htm#fr_340">131:1</A> Sakkhar&acirc; and ka<I>th</I>ala, the exact distinction between which two terms is not stated.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_334"></A><A HREF="sbe20037.htm#fr_341">131:2</A> Samudda-phe<I>n</I>aka. By this name are designated the bones of the cuttle-fish which, when cast up by the waves on the sea-shore, are not unlike petrified foam, and have actually been introduced from the East into use in Europe as a kind of rough natural soap; and are now sold for that purpose in most chemists' shops in England (compare Meerschaum). The same word is found in later Sanskrit works.</P>
