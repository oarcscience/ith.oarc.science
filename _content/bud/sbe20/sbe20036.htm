<p>1. Now the Blessed One, when he had stayed at Ves&acirc;l&icirc; as long as he thought fit, set out on his journey toward Bhagg&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_321"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And journeying straight on he arrived in due course at Bhagg&acirc;. And there at Bhagg&acirc; the Blessed One resided on the Dragon's Hill, in the hermitage in the Bhesaka<I>l</I>&acirc; Wood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_322"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Now at that time Bodhi the king's son's mansion, which was called Kokanada, had just been finished, and had not as yet been used&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> by Sama<I>n</I>a, or by Br&acirc;hman, or by any human being. And Bodhi the king's son gave command to the young Brahman, the son of the Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ika woman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, saying, 'Come</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A></p>  
<p>now, my friend Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ik&acirc;-putta, go thou to the place where the Blessed One is, and when you have come there, bow down in salutation at his feet on my behalf, and enquire in my name whether he is free from sickness and suffering, and is in the enjoyment of ease and comfort and vigorous health, saying, "Bodhi the king's son, Lord, bows down in salutation at thy feet, and enquires [as I have said]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and asks: 'May my Lord the Blessed One consent to take his to-morrow's meal with Bodhi the king's son, together with the Sa<I>m</I>gha of Bhikkhus.''</p>  
<p>'Even so, Sir!' said the young Brahman Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ik&acirc;-putta, in assent to Bodhi the king's son. And he went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and when he had come there he exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and compliments of friendship and civility. And when he had done so, he took his seat on one side, and se seated he [delivered to him the message even as me king's son had commanded]. And the Blessed One gave, by silence, his consent.</p>  
<p>2. And when the young Brahman Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ik&acirc;-putta had perceived that the Blessed One had consented, he arose from his seat, and went up to the place where Bodhi the king's son was. And when he had come there, he said to him: 'We have spoken, Sir, in your behalf to that venerable Gotama, saying (&amp;c., as before), and have received the consent of the Sama<I>n</I>a Gotama.'</p>  
<p>Then Bodhi the king's son made ready at the end</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of that night sweet food, both hard and soft; and had the mansion Kokanada spread over with white cloths even unto the last planks in the flight of steps (at the entrance)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and gave command to the young Brahman Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ik&acirc;-putta, saying, 'Come now, my friend Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ik&acirc;-putta, go thou up to the place where the Blessed One is; and when you have come there, announce the time, saying, "The meal, Lord, is ready, and the time has come."'</p>  
<p>'Even so, Lord,' said Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ik&acirc;-putta in assent [and went to the Blessed One and announced accordingly].</p>  
<p>Now the Blessed One, having dressed himself early in the morning, went, duly bowled and robed, to Bodhi the king's son's mansion. And Bodhi the king's son stood at that time at the portico over the outer door to welcome the Blessed One. And he saw the Blessed One coming from afar; and on seeing him he went forth thence to meet him, and when he had saluted the Blessed One, he returned again to the mansion Kokanada.</p>  
<p>Now the Blessed One stopped at the last plank on the flight of steps at the entrance. And Bodhi the king's son said to the Blessed One, 'May my Lord the Blessed One walk over the cloths. May the Happy One walk over the cloths, that the same may be to me for a long time for a weal and for a joy.'</p>  
<p>And when he had thus spoken, the Blessed One remained silent. And a second time he [preferred the same request in the same words with the same</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A></p>  
<p>result]. And a third time he [preferred the same request]. Then the Blessed One looked round at the venerable &Acirc;nanda.</p>  
<p>And the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to Bodhi the king's son, 'Let them gather up, O prince, these cloths. The Blessed One will not walk on a, strip of cloth (laid down for ceremonial purposes)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The Tath&acirc;gata has mercy even on the meanest thing.'</p>  
<p>3. Then Bodhi the king's son had the cloths gathered up, and spread out a seat on the top of Kokanada. And the Blessed One ascended up into Kokanada, and sat down on the seat spread out there with the Sa<I>m</I>gha of Bhikkhus. And Bodhi the king's son satisfied the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha with the Buddha at their head with the sweet food, both hard and soft, waiting upon them with his own hand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_328"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And when the Blessed One had cleansed his bowl and his hands, he (Bodhi) took his seat on one side. And the Blessed One instructed, and roused, and incited, and gladdened him thus sitting with religious discourse. And when he had been thus instructed, and roused, and incited, and gladdened</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with religious discourse, Bodhi the king's son rose from his seat and departed thence.</p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, convened an assembly of the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha, and after he had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus and said:</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to walk upon cloth laid down (for ceremonial purposes). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>4. Now at that time a certain woman who had had a miscarriage, and had invited the Bhikkhus, and spread cloths in their honour, said to them. 'Step, Sirs, over the cloth.'</p>  
<p>The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not do so.</p>  
<p>'Step, Sirs, over the cloth, for good luck's sake.'</p>  
<p>The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not do so.</p>  
<p>Then that woman murmured, was annoyed, and was indignant, saying, 'How can their reverences refuse to step over the cloth when they are asked to do so for good luck's sake?'</p>  
<p>The Bhikkhus heard of that woman's murmuring, and being annoyed, and indignant. And they told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, when asked to do so for the sake of good luck to laymen, to step over cloth laid down for ceremonial purposes.'</p>  
<p>Now at the time the Bhikkhus were afraid to step on to a mat to be used for wiping the feet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>
