<p>1. Now when the Blessed One had stayed at Ves&acirc;l&icirc; as long as he thought fit, he sat out towards S&acirc;vatthi; and, journeying straight on, he in due course arrived thereat. And there, at S&acirc;vatthi, the Blessed One remained in the <I>G</I>etavana, An&acirc;tha Pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>ika's Park.</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus threw dirty water over Bhikkhun&icirc;s, thinking, perhaps, they would fall in love with them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_868"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'A Bhikkhu is not, O Bhikkhus, to throw dirty water at a Bhikkhun&icirc;. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow a penalty, O Bhikkhus, to be imposed on that Bhikkhu.</p>  
<p>Then the Bhikkhus thought: 'What penalty is it that ought to be imposed on him?' They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'That Bhikkhu is to be declared to be one who is not to be saluted by the Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_869"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus uncovered their bodies, or their thighs, or their private parts, and showed them to Bhikkhun&icirc;s, or addressed Bhikkhun&icirc;s with wicked words, or associated with Bhikkhun&icirc;s, thinking, perhaps, they would fall in love with them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_870"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_336"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 336</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'A Bhikkhu is not, O Bhikkhus, to do [any of these things]. Whosoever does, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow, O Bhikkhus, a penalty to be imposed on that Bhikkhu.'</p>  
<p>Then the Bhikkhus thought: 'What penalty is it that ought to be imposed on him?' They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'That Bhikkhu is to be declared to be one who is not to be saluted by the Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha.'</p>  
<p>2. [The last section repeated of the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhun&icirc;s, the decision being the same down to]</p>  
<p>Then the Bhikkhus thought: 'What penalty is it that ought to be imposed on her?' They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to prohibit her (from entering a Vih&acirc;ra)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>When the prohibition was laid upon them, they would not accept it. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to inhibit them from the Exhortation.'</p>  
<p>3. Then the Bhikkhus thought: 'Is it lawful to hold Uposatha with a Bhikkhun&icirc; who has been inhibited from the Exhortation, or is it not lawful?'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to hold Uposatha with a Bhikkhun&icirc; who has been inhibited from the Exhortation until such time as her case has been settled.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the venerable Ud&acirc;yi, after having inhibited the Exhortation (to one or more Bhikkhun&icirc;s), went away on a journey. The Bhikkhun&icirc;s</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_337"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 337</FONT></A></p>  
<p>murmured, were indignant, and complained, saying: 'How can the venerable Ud&acirc;yi [act so]?'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to go on a journey after having inhibited the Exhortation. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time foolish and incompetent Bhikkhus inhibited the Exhortation,</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'The Exhortation is not, O Bhikkhus, to be inhibited by a foolish, incompetent Bhikkhu. When such a one does so, he shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time Bhikkhus inhibited the Exhortation without grounds and without cause.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to inhibit the Exhortation without ground and without cause. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time Bhikkhus, who had inhibited the Exhortation, would not give a decision (on the matter out of which the inhibition arose).</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'When, O Bhikkhus, you have inhibited the Exhortation, you are not to abstain from giving a decision (on the matter out of which the inhibition arose). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>4. Now at that time Bhikkhun&icirc;s did not go to the Exhortation. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'A Bhikkhun&icirc;, O Bhikkhus, is not to omit going to the Exhortation. Whosoever does so, shall be dealt with according to the rule&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_886"></A><A HREF="#fn_872"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_338"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 338</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Now at that time the whole Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha went to the Exhortation together. The people murmured, were indignant, and complained, saying: 'There are their wives, there are their mistresses; now will they take pleasure together.'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'The whole Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha is not, O Bhikkhus, to go to the Exhortation together. And if it should so go, it is guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a. I allow, O Bhikkhus, four or five Bhikkhun&icirc;s to go together.'</p>  
<p>[The same when four or five went the decision ending,]</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, two or three Bhikkhun&icirc;s to go together to Exhortation; and let them go up to some one Bhikkhu, and arrange their robes over one shoulder, and, sitting down on their heels, let them stretch forth their joined palms, and thus address him: "The Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha salutes the feet of the Bhikkhu-sa<I>m</I>gha, and requests permission to come for the purpose of the Exhortation being held; may that be granted, they say, to the Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha."</p>  
<p>'Then he who is entrusted with the recitation of the P&acirc;timokkha is to ask: "Is there any Bhikkhu who has been appointed to hold the Exhortation of the Bhikkhun&icirc;s?"</p>  
<p>'If a Bhikkhu has been appointed thereto, the reciter of the P&acirc;timokkha is to say: "Such and such a Bhikkhu has been appointed to hold Exhortation to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s. Let the Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha come to him accordingly."</p>  
<p>'If no Bhikkhu has been appointed thereto the reciter of the P&acirc;timokkha is to say: "Which of the venerable ones is able to hold Exhortation to</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the Bhikkhun&icirc;s?" If any one is able to do so, and is possessed of the eight qualifications&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_873"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he is to appoint him thereto, and is to say: "Such and such a Bhikkhu is appointed to hold Exhortation to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s. Let the Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha come to him."</p>  
<p>'If no one is able to do so, the reciter of the P&acirc;timokkha is to say: "There is no Bhikkhu appointed to hold Exhortation to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s. May the Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<I>m</I>gha obtain its desire in peace&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="#fn_874"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>."'</p>  
<p>5. Now at that time Bhikkhus did not accept the (office of holding) Exhortation. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'The Exhortation is not, O Bhikkhus, to be declined. Whosoever shall not accept it, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu was stupid. To him the Bhikkhun&icirc;s went, and said: 'Sir, please to accept the (duty of holding) Exhortation.'</p>  
<p>'I, sister, am stupid. How can I accept the Exhortation?'</p>  
<p>'You should take it, Sir; for thus has it been laid down by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus are to accept the (duty of holding) Exhortation to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s."'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow, O Bhikkhus, all the rest, save the stupid, to accept the Exhortation.'</p>  
<p>[The same repeated of a sick Bhikkhu, and a</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Bhikkhu on a journey. The same case put of a Bhikkhu living in the jungle. The decision is,]</p>  
<p>'I allow a Bhikkhu living in the jungle, O Bhikkhus, to accept the Exhortation, and to appoint a time and place for the meeting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_875"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, saying: "There will I perform it."'</p>  
<p>Now at that time Bhikkhus accepted the Exhortation, but did not perform it. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'The Exhortation, O Bhikkhus, is not to be neglected. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time Bhikkhun&icirc;s did not attend at the place appointed. They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'A Bhikkhun&icirc; is not, O Bhikkhus, to omit attending at the place appointed. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>
