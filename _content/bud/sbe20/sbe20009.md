### 8.

1\. 'Now, O Bhikkhus, an official act carried out against a Bhikkhu who
has confessed himself guilty is invalid as follows, and is valid as
follows. And how does such an official act become invalid? In case a
Bhikkhu have committed a Pârâ*g*ika offence, and in respect thereof
either the Sa*m*gha, or a number of Bhikkhus, or a single Bhikkhu warns
him, saying, "The venerable one has been guilty of a Pârâ*g*ika." And he
replies thus, "I have not, Sirs, been guilty of a Pârâ*g*ika. I have
been guilty of a Sa*m*ghâdisesa." And in respect thereof the Sa*m*gha
deals with him for a Sa*m*ghâdisesa. Then that official act is invalid.'

\[And so also if on being warned of any one of the seven offences <span
id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_38) he confesses himself to be guilty of any
one of the offences different from the one charged, then the official
act is invalid.\]

2\. 'And when, O Bhikkhus, is such an official act valid? In case a
Bhikkhu have committed a Pârâ*g*ika offence, and in respect thereof the
Sa*m*gha, or a number of Bhikkhus, or a single Bhikkhu warns him,
saying, "The venerable one has been guilty of a Pârâ*g*ika." And he
replies, "Yea, Sirs, I have been guilty of a Pârâ*g*ika." And in respect
thereof the Sa*m*gha deals with him for a Pârâ*g*ika. Then that official
act is valid <span id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_39).'

\[And so for each of the other offences mentioned in § 1, the whole of §
2 is repeated.\]

<span id="fn_38"></span>[24:1](sbe20009.htm#fr_39) The same, namely, as
those in the list given at Mahâvagga IV, 16, 12, &c.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[24:2](sbe20009.htm#fr_40) In other words, if a
Bhikkhu confesses an offence different from that with which he has been
charged, the confession cannot be used against him even as regards a
decision with respect to the offence confessed.
