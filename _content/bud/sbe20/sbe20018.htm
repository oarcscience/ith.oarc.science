<p>1. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to sing the Dhamma with the abrupt transitions of song-singing.</p>  
<p>The people murmured, were annoyed, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<I>n</I>as [do so]?' The Bhikkhus heard (&amp;c., as usual, down to) he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
<p>'These five dangers, O Bhikkhus, befall him who sings the Dhamma with the abrupt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> transitions of song-singing.--He himself becomes captivated with respect to the sound thereof.--Other people become captivated with respect to the sound thereof.--The laymen are shocked.--The meditation of one who strains after accuracy in the sound is broken.--The common people fall into heresy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.--These five dangers, O Bhikkhus, befall him who sings the Dhamma with the abrupt transitions of song-singing. The Dhamma is not, O Bhikkhus, to be sung [in that manner]. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_143"></A><A HREF="sbe20018.htm#fr_148">72:1</A> &Acirc;yatakena g&icirc;ta-ssarena. Compare &acirc;yataken&#8217; eva pap&acirc;to at <I>K</I>ullavagga IX, 1, 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_144"></A><A HREF="sbe20018.htm#fr_149">72:2</A> Probably this is supposed to result because dhamma being sung and not said is not intelligible to them--a complaint often made against the singing of prayers among Protestant Christians. On pa<I>k</I><I>kh</I>im&acirc; <I>g</I>anat&acirc;, compare the closing words of V, 21, 2; and on the rest of the phrase, Puggala III, 10, 14 The translation of sarakutti<I>m</I> is also very doubtful.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_145"></A><A HREF="sbe20018.htm#fr_150">72:3</A> Sara-bha<I>&ntilde;</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a<I>m</I>. So in the Mah&acirc;vagga we hear that So<I>n</I>a <A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A> intoned before the Buddha a chapter from the Sutta Nip&acirc;ta. The expression there used is sarena abh&acirc;si, of which our word is used as the verbal noun, the roots bha<I>n</I> and bh&acirc;s being not only synonymous but interchangeable. (See, for instance, Vin. Pit. vol. iv, p. 353.) Perhaps 'recitative' would be a good rendering. I have several times heard the Dhamma thus recited by living Buddhists in accordance with the traditional interpretation of this passage, and their Sara-bha<I>&ntilde;</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a<I>m</I> was precisely like the intoning of prose passages as practised in our cathedral churches (Rh. D.).</P>
