<p>1. Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu went on his round for alms with long finger-nails. A certain woman, seeing him, said to that Bhikkhu: 'Come along, Sir, and have connection with me.'</p>  
<p>'Nay, Sister, that is not becoming.'</p>  
<p>'If you do not, Sir, I will at once scratch&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> my limbs with my own nails, and will make as if I were angry, saying, "This Bhikkhu has ill-treated me."'</p>  
<p>'Settle that with yourself, Sister.'</p>  
<p>That woman did as she had said, and people running up seized that Bhikkhu. Then they saw skin and blood on the woman's nails; and on seeing that, they let the Bhikkhu go, saying, 'This is the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A></p>  
<p>work of the woman herself. The Bhikkhu has not done it.'</p>  
<p>Then that Bhikkhu, returning to the &Acirc;r&acirc;ma, told the matter to the Bhikkhus.</p>  
<p>'What then, Sir, do you wear long nails?'</p>  
<p>'It is even so, Sirs.'</p>  
<p>The Bhikkhus who were moderate murmured (&amp;c. . . . .) told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear long nails. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>2. Now at that time the Bhikkhus tore off their nails with the nails, bit them off with their teeth, or rubbed them down against the wall; and their fingers were hurt.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, nail-cutters.'</p>  
<p>They cut their nails down to the blood, and their fingers were hurt.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cut your nails according to the length of the flesh.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus had all the twenty nails (on their hands and feet) polished.</p>  
<p>People murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like those who still live in the pleasures of the world.'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have the twenty nails polished. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to remove the dirt only.'</p>  
<p>3. Now at that time the Bhikkhus' hair grew long.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'Are the Bhikkhus able, O Bhikkhus, to remove one another's hair?'</p>  
<p>'They are, Lord.'</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, after he had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of razors, of a hone to sharpen the razors on, of powder prepared with Sip&acirc;<I>t</I>ika-gum to prevent them rusting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, of a sheath to hold them in&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and of all the apparatus of a barber&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_348"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>4. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus wore (&amp;c., as usual, down to)</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have your beards cut (by barbers)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, nor to let them grow long, nor to wear them long on the chin like a goat's beard&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, nor so cut that they have four corners&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, nor to cut off the hair growing on your breast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, nor to cut the hair on your bellies into figures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, nor to wear whiskers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>, nor to remove the hair from your private parts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>.

<p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a fistula&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the ointment would not stick to it.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of disease, to remove the hair from the private parts.'</p>  
<p>5. Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to)</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have your hair cut off with a knife&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu had a sore on his head, and the hair could not be removed with a razor.</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, on account of disease, to have your hair cut off with a knife.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus wore the hair in their nostrils long.</p>  
<p>People murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like the devil-worshippers &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to wear the hair in your nostrils long. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>  
<p>Now at that time the Bhikkhus had the hair in their nostrils pulled out with a potsherd&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, or with. beeswax; and their nostrils were hurt.</p>

<p>Now at that time the <I>Kh</I>abbaggiya Bhikkhus (&amp;c.; as before, ending with)</p>  
<p>'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to have the white hairs pulled out (off your heads). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<I>t</I>a.'</p>
