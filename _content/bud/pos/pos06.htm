How was she reborn?
</P>
<P>
Long ago, a certain daughter of one of the clans became a fervent believer in the teaching of the Buddha Ko&#x1E47;&#x0101;gamana, <A HREF="pos06.htm#9-1"><sup>78</sup></A> and entertained him hospitably. She had an arbour made with boughs, a draped ceiling, and a sanded floor, and did him honour with flowers and perfumes. And all her life doing meritorious acts, she was reborn among the gods, and then again among men when Kassapa was Buddha, under whom she renounced the world. Reborn again in heaven till this Buddha-dispensation, she was finally born in a great nobleman's family at Ves&#x0101;l&#x012B;. From the sturdy build of her body they called her Sturdykin. She became the devoted wife of a young noble. When the Master came to Ves&#x0101;l&#x012B;, she was convinced by his teaching, and became a lay-disciple. Anon, hearing the Great Paj&#x0101;pat&#x012B; the Elder preaching the Doctrine, the wish arose in her to leave the
world, and she told this to her husband. He would not consent; so she went on performing her duties, reflecting on the sweetness of the doctrine, and living devoted to insight. Then, one day in the kitchen, while the curry was cooking, a mighty flame of fire shot up, and burnt all the food with much crackling. She, watching it, made it a basis for rapt meditation on the utter impermanence of all things. Thereby she was established in the Fruition of the Path of No-Return. Thenceforth she wore no more jewels and ornaments. When her husband asked her the reason, she told him how incapable she felt of living a domestic life. So he brought her, as Vis&#x0101;kha brought Dhammadinn&#x0101;,<A HREF="pos06.htm#10-1"><sup>79</sup></A> with a large following, to Great Paj&#x0101;pat&#x012B; the Gotamid, and said: 'Let the reverend Sisters give her ordination.' And Paj&#x0101;pat&#x012B; did so, and showed her the Master; and the Master, emphasizing, as was his custom, the visible basis whereby she had attained, spoke the verse above.
</P>
<P>
Now, when she had attained Arahantship, the Sister repeated that verse in her exultation, wherefore this verse became her verse.

This is the verse of a student named Mutt&#x0101;. She, too, being one who had made a resolve under former Buddhas, went on heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that state of becoming. Finally, she was reborn in this Buddha-dispensation as the child of an eminent brahmin at S&#x0101;vatth&#x012B;, and named Mutt&#x0101;. And in her twentieth year, her destiny being fully ripe, she renounced the world under the Great Paj&#x0101;pat&#x012B; the Gotamid, and studied the exercises for ecstatic insight. Returning one day from her round for alms, she discharged her duties toward her seniors, and then going apart to rest, and seated out of sight, she began to concentrate herself. Then the Master, sitting in the 'Fragrant Chamber'<A HREF="pos06.htm#11-1"><sup>83</sup></A> of the Vih&#x0101;ra, sent forth glory, and revealing himself as if seated before her, uttered the verse above. And she, steadfast in that exhortation, not long after attained Arahantship, and so attaining, exulted in the words of that verse. Completing her studies and promoted to full rank, she yet again uttered it, when about to pass away.

The following verse is that of Tiss&#x0101;, a student. Heaping up merit under former Buddhas, Tiss&#x0101; was, in this Buddha-dispensation, reborn at Kapilavatthu in the noble clan of the S&#x0101;kiyas. Made a lady of the Bodhisat's court, she renounced the world with Great Paj&#x0101;pat&#x012B; the Gotamid, and practised herself in insight. To her the Master appeared as to the foregoing Sisters, and said:

Mutt&#x0101;, heaping up good under former Buddhas, was, in this Buddha-dispensation, born in the land of Kosala as the daughter of a poor brahmin named Ogh&#x0101;&#x1E6D;aka. Come to proper age, she was given to a hunchbacked brahmin; but she told him she could not continue in the life of the house, and induced him to consent to her leaving the world. Exercising herself in insight, her thoughts still ran on external objects of interest. So she practised self-control, and, repeating her verse, strove after insight till she won Arahantship; then exulting, she repeated:

Now, she, in the time when Padumuttara was Buddha, lived at Ha&#x014B;savat&#x012B; in a state of servitude; and because she ministered and did honour to one of the chief apostles when he rose from his cataleptic trance, she was reborn in heaven and so on, among gods and men, till Phussa was Buddha. Then she worked merit by doubling the gift prescribed by her husband to the Master's half-brothers while they were staying in a servant's house. And when Kassapa was Buddha, she came to birth in the house of Kiki, King of K&#x0101;s&#x012B;, as one of the Seven Sisters, his daughters,<A HREF="pos06.htm#16-1"><sup>101</sup></A> and for 20,000 years lived a holy life. . . . Finally, in this Buddha-dispensation, she was reborn of a clansman's family at R&#x0101;jagaha, and became the wife of Vis&#x0101;kha, a leading citizen. Now one day her husband went to hear the Master teaching, and became One-who-returns-no-more. When he came home, Dhammadinn&#x0101; met him as he went up the stairs; but he leant not on her outstretched hand, nor spoke to her at supper. And she asked: 'Dear sir, why did you not take my hand? Why do you not talk to me? Have I done anything amiss?' ''Tis for no fault in you, Dhammadinn&#x0101;; but from henceforth I am not fit to touch a woman or take pleasure in food, for of such is the doctrine now borne in upon me. Do you according as you wish, either continuing to dwell here, or taking as much wealth as you need and going back to your family.' 'Nay, dear sir, I will make no such goings back. Suffer me to leave the world.' 'It is well, Dhammadinn&#x0101;,' replied Vis&#x0101;kha, and sent her to the Bhikkhun&#x012B;s in a golden palanquin. Admitted to the Order, she shortly after asked permission of her teachers to go into retreat, saying: 'Mothers, my heart hath no delight in a place of crowds; I would go into a village abode.' The Bhikkhun&#x012B;s brought her thither, and while there, because in her past lives she had subjugated the complexities of thought, word, and deed, she soon attained Arahantship, together with thorough mastery of the form and meaning of the Dhamma.<A HREF="pos06.htm#17-1"><sup>102</sup></A> Thereupon she thought: 'Now have I reached the summit. What shall I do here any longer? I will even go to R&#x0101;jagaha and worship the Master, and many of my kinsfolk will, through me, acquire merit.' So she returned with her Bhikkhun&#x012B;s. Then Vis&#x0101;kha, hearing of her return, curious to know why she came, interviewed her with questions on the Khandhas and the like. And Dhammadinn&#x0101; answered every question as one might cut a lotus-stalk with a knife, and finally referred him to the Master. The Master praised her great wisdom, as it is told in the Lesser Vedalla (Miscellany) Sutta,<A HREF="pos06.htm#17-2"><sup>103</sup></A> and ranked her foremost among the Sisters who could preach.

<sup>104</sup> In the mythology of Buddhism respecting the after-life, the <I>Uddha&#x014B;-soto</I> was one who, having destroyed here below only the first five of the ten Fetters (to destroy all ten meant Nibbana in this life), <!-- page 18 --> was reborn successively in an ever higher heaven, till, reaching the Supreme or Akani&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;ha Sphere, he there passed away. The expression means rather rising <I>above the stream</I> of sa&#x014B;s&#x0101;ra than going against it; but it is ambiguous, and, anyway, the upward effort is expressed in either metaphor. The Commentary has, as the last word, not <I>ti vuccati</I> ('is called'), but <I>vimuccati</I> ('is set free'). As it does not comment on the latter term, I incline to hold it a misreading.

She too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good in this life and in that, was, in this Buddha-dispensation, born at S&#x0101;vatth&#x012B; as the sister of the King of Kosala.

Fain to leave the world, she put off doing so that she might take care of her grandmother as long as she lived. After the grandmother's death, Suman&#x0101; went, accompanied by the King, to the Vih&#x0101;ra, taking much treasure in carpets and shawls, and presenting them to the Order.

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up merit in this and that state of becoming, was, in this Buddha-dispensation, born in a respectable family at S&#x0101;vatth&#x012B;. Given in marriage to a suitable husband, she became converted, and desired to leave the world, but her husband would not consent. So she waited till after his death, and then entered the Order.

<sup>115</sup> The text has simply <I>disv&#x0101;</I>, 'seeing.' But the word, when applied to spiritual insight, has the glamour of our 'Seer'; hence the Commentary's comment, 'Seeing with the eye of Insight.' 'Rose up' in the Pali is 'was set at liberty.'
