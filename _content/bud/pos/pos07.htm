<P>
B<small>ORN</small> in the time of the Buddha Vipassi, in his native town of Bandhumat&#x012B;, as the daughter of a wealthy burgess, she became a pious lay-adherent, and at the Master's death she made an offering to the shrine of his ashes of a golden umbrella <A HREF="pos07.htm#22-1"><sup>117</sup></A> surrounded with jewels. Reborn for this in various heavens, she was, in this Buddha-dispensation, reborn at Kapilavatthu as the daughter of the chief wife of Khemaka, the S&#x0101;kiyan, and named Nand&#x0101;. But because of her excessive beauty, charm, and loveliness, she was known as Nand&#x0101; the Fair.
</P>

<P>
Now, on the day when she was to choose among her suitors,<A HREF="pos07.htm#22-2"><sup>118</sup></A> Carabh&#x016B;ta, her young S&#x0101;kiyan kinsman, died. Then her parents made her leave the world against her will. But she, even after she had entered the Order, was infatuated with her own beauty, and, fearing the Master's rebuke, avoided his presence. Now the Exalted One knew that she was ripe for knowledge, and directed the Great Paj&#x0101;jat&#x012B; to let all the Bhikkhun&#x012B;s come to him for instruction. Nand&#x0101; sent another in her place. And the Exalted One said, 'Let no one come by proxy.' So she was compelled to come. And the Exalted One, by his mystic power, conjured up a beautiful woman, and showed her becoming aged and fading, causing anguish to arise in Nand&#x0101;. And he addressed her in these words:

Quite literally, the quaint and elliptical passage runs: 'The shameless one me "sunshade" only,' which the Commentary explains as 'My husband calls me not even an umbrella which he makes for his livelihood.' There seems nothing in verses or Commentary to justify Dr. Neumann's inference that her husband lived on her adulterous earnings. Toil has spoilt her looks, and he takes no further pleasure in them.

But she reviled an Arahant Elder Sister by calling her a prostitute,<A HREF="pos07.htm#25-3"><sup>127</sup></A> and for this she went to purgatory. In this Buddha-dispensation she was
reborn in the kingdom of K&#x0101;s&#x012B; as the child of a distinguished and prosperous citizen. But because of the persistent effect of her former evil speech, she became herself a prostitute. How she left the world and was ordained by special messenger is related in the Culla Vagga. <A HREF="pos07.htm#26-1"><sup>128</sup></A> For she wished to go to S&#x0101;vatth&#x012B; to be ordained by the Exalted One.

I have before me a photograph of a Ceylonese bhikkhu seated in the cleft of a rock contemplating two skulls and other bones lying before him&#8211;a modern snapshot of a scene that might be 2,500 years old instead of 250 days.

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that state of becoming, being reborn in fortunate conditions, took birth, in this Buddha-dispensation, at Kosamb&#x012B;, in the family of an eminent burgess. When her dear friend, the lay-disciple S&#x0101;m&#x0101;vat&#x012B;, died, she, in her distress, left the world. But being unable to subdue her grief for her friend, she was unable to grasp the Ariyan Way. Now, while she was seated in the sitting-room, listening to Elder &#x0100;nanda preaching, she was established in insight, and, on the seventh day after, attained Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Dhamma in form and meaning.

And reflecting on what she had won, she expressed it in this psalm:

Four times, nay, five, I sallied from my cell, <BR>
And roamed afield to find the peace of mind <BR>
I sought in vain, and governance of thoughts <BR>
I could not bring into captivity. <A HREF="pos07.htm#32-2"><sup>145</sup></A> (37)</A><BR><A NAME="38">
To me, even to me, on that eighth day <BR>
It came: all craving ousted from my heart. <BR>
'Mid many sore afflictions, I had wrought <BR>
With passionate endeavour, and had won! <BR>
Craving was dead, and the Lord's will was done. (38)</A>
