## <span id="C-VIII">CANTO VIII PSALM OF EIGHT VERSES</span>

### <span id="LXI">LXI Sīsupacālā</span>

H<span class="small">ER</span> story has been told in that of Cālā her
sister–how she followed in her great brother's steps, entered the Order,
and became an Arahant. Dwelling in the bliss of fruition, she reflected
one day on her attainment, and having done all that was to be done,
exulted in her happiness thus:

<span id="196">Lo! here a Sister, in the Precepts sure,<br />
Well-guarded in the sixfold way of sense,</span> <a href="pos13.htm#100-1"><sup>299</sup></a><br />
Who hath attainèd to that Holy Path,<br />
That ever-welling elixir of life. <a href="pos13.htm#100-2"><sup>300</sup></a> (196)
<p><em>Māra.</em></p>
<p>Now think upon the Three-and-Thirty Gods,<br />
And on the gods who rule in realm of Shades,<br />
On those who reign in heaven of Bliss, and on<br />
Those higher deities who live where life<br />
Yet flows by way of sense and of desire: <a href="pos13.htm#100-3"><sup>301</sup></a><br />
Think and thither aspire with longing heart,<br />
Where in past ages thou hast lived before. (197)</p></td>

When the Therī heard, she said: 'Stop, Māra! the Kāmaloka of which you
talk is, even as is the whole of the world, burning and blazing with the
fires of lust, hate, and ignorance. 'Tis not there the discerning mind
can find any charm.' And showing Māra how her mind was turned away from
the world and from desires of sense, she upbraided him thus:

<p><span id="198">Ay, think upon</span> <a href="pos13.htm#101-1"><sup>302</sup></a> the Three-and-Thirty gods,<br />
And on the gods who rule in realm of Shades;<br />
On those who reign in heaven of Bliss, and on<br />
Those higher deities who live where life<br />
Yet flows by way of sense and of desire. (198)<br />
<span id="199">Consider how time after time they go<br />
From birth to death, and death to birth again,<br />
Becoming this and then becoming that,<br />
Ever beset by the recurring doom<br />
Of hapless individuality,<br />
Whence comes no merciful enfranchisement. (199)</span><br />
<br />
<span id="200">On fire is all the world, is all in flames!<br />
Ablaze is all the world, the heav'ns do quake!</span> <a href="pos13.htm#101-2"><sup>303</sup></a> (200)<br />
<span id="201">But that which quaketh not, that ever sure,<br />
That priceless thing, unheeded by the world,<br />
Even the Norm–<em>that</em> hath the Buddha taught<br />
To me, therein my mind delighted dwells. (201)</span><br />
<span id="202">And I who heard his blessed word abide<br />
Fain only and alway to do his will.<br />
The Threefold Wisdom have I gotten now,<br />
And done the bidding of the Buddha blest. (202)</span><br />
<span id="203">On every hand the love of sense is slain<br />
And the thick gloom of ignorance is rent<br />
In twain. Know this, O Evil One, avaunt!<br />
Here, O Destroyer, shalt thou not prevail! (203)</span></p></td>
