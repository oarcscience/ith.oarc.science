### <span id="L">L Paṭācārā's Five Hundred.</span> [<sup>252</sup>](pos11.htm#77-1)

T<span class="small">HESE</span> too, having fared under former Buddhas
as the foregoing Sisters, were, in this Buddha-era, reborn in some
clansman's house in divers places, were married, and bore children,
living domestic lives. And having wrought karma such as would bring to
pass such a result, they suffered bereavement in the death of a child.
Then they found their way, overwhelmed with grief, to Paṭācārā, and
saluting her, and seated by, her, told her the manner of their sorrow.
The Sister, restraining their sorrow, spake thus:

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p><span id="127">The way by which men come we cannot know;<br />
Nor can we see the path by which they go.<br />
Why mournest then for him who came to thee,<br />
Lamenting through thy tears: 'My son! my son!' (127)</span><br />
<span id="128">Seeing thou knowest not the way he came,<br />
Nor yet the manner of his leaving thee?<br />
Weep not, for such is here the life of man. (128)</span><br />
<span id="129">Unask'd he came, unbidden went he hence.<br />
Lo! ask thyself again whence came thy son<br />
To bide on earth this little breathing space? (129)</span><br />
<span id="130">By one way come and by another gone,<br />
As man to die, and pass to other births–<br />
So hither and so hence–why would ye weep?</span> <a href="pos11.htm#78-1"><sup>253</sup></a> (130)</p></td>

They, hearing her doctrine, were filled with agitation, and, under the
Therī, renounced the world. Exercising themselves henceforth in insight,
their faculties growing ripe for emancipation, they soon became
established in Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and
in meaning. Thereafter, pondering on their attainment, they exulted in
those words, 'The way by which men come,' adding thereto other verses,
and repeating them in turn, as follows:

Now, because those 500 Bhikkhums were versed in the teaching of
Paṭācārā, therefore they got the name of The Paṭācārā's.

### <span id="LI">LI Vāsiṭṭhī.</span> [<sup>256</sup>](pos11.htm#79-3)

She, too, faring under former Buddhas like the foregoing, was, in this
Buddha-era, reborn in a clansman's family at Vesālī. Her parents gave
her in marriage to a clansman's son of equal rank, and she, bearing one
son, lived happily with her husband. But when the child was able to run
about, he died; and she was worn and maddened with grief. And while the
relatives were administering healing to the husband, she, unknown to
them, ran away raving, and wandered round and round till she came to
Mithilā. There she saw the Exalted One going down the next street,
self-controlled, self-contained, master of his faculties. And at the
sight of the wondrous Chief, [<sup>257</sup>](pos11.htm#79-4) and
through the potency of the Buddha, she regained her normal mind from the
frenzy that had befallen her. Then the Master taught her the Norm in
outline, and in agitation she asked him that she might enter the Order,
and by his command she was admitted. Performing all requisite duties and
preliminaries, she established insight, and, striving with might and
main, and with ripening knowledge, she soon attained Arahantship,
together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in spirit.
Reflecting on her attainment, she exulted thus:

### <span id="LII">LII Khemā.</span>

Now she, when Padumuttara was Buddha, became a slave to others,
dependent for her livelihood on others, at Haŋsavatī. And one day,
seeing the Elder, Sujāta, seeking alms, she gave him three sweet cakes,
and at the same time took down her hair [<sup>259</sup>](pos11.htm#81-1)
and gave it to the Elder, saying: 'May I in the future become a
disciple, great in wisdom, of a Buddha!' After many fortunate rebirths
as Queen among both gods and men, for that she had wrought good karma to
the uttermost, she became a human, when Vipassi
[<sup>260</sup>](pos11.htm#81-2) was Buddha. Renouncing the world, she
became a learned preacher of the Norm. Reborn, when Kakusandha was
Buddha, in a wealthy family, she made a great park for the Order, and
delivered it over to the Order with the Buddha at their head. She did
this again when Koṇāgamana was Buddha. When Kassapa was Buddha she
became the eldest daughter of King Kiki,
[<sup>261</sup>](pos11.htm#81-3) named Samaṇī, lived a pious life, and
gave a cell to the Order. Finally, in this Buddha-era, she was born in
Magadha, at Sāgala, [<sup>262</sup>](pos11.htm#81-4) as one of the
King's family, and named Khemā. Beautiful, and with skin like gold, she
became the consort of King Bimbisāra. While the Master was at the Bamboo
Grove[<sup>263</sup>](pos11.htm#81-5) she, being infatuated with her own
beauty, would not go to see him, fearing he would look on this as a
fault in her. The King bade persons praise the Grove to her to induce
her to visit it. And accordingly she asked him to let her see it. The
King went to the Vihāra, and seeing no Master, but determined that she
should not get away, he instructed his men to let the Queen see Him of
the Ten Powers, even by constraining her. And this they did when the
Queen was about to leave without meeting the Master. As they brought her
reluctant, the Master, by mystic potency, conjured up a woman like a
celestial nymph, who stood fanning him with a palmyra leaf. And Khemā,
seeing her, thought: 'Verily the Exalted One has around him women as
lovely as goddesses. I am not fit even to wait upon such. I am undone by
my base and mistaken notions!' Then, as she looked, that woman, through
the steadfast will of the Master, passed from youth to middle age and
old age, till, with broken teeth, grey hair, and wrinkled skin, she fell
to earth with her palm-leaf. Then Khemā, because of her ancient resolve,
thought: 'Has such a body come to be a wreck like that? Then so will my
body also!' And the Master, knowing her thoughts, said:

> 'They who are slaves to lust drift down the stream,  
> Like to a spider gliding down the web  
> He of himself has wrought. But the released,  
> Who all their bonds have snapt in twain,  
> With thoughts elsewhere intent, forsake the world,  
> And all delight in sense put far away.'
> [<sup>264</sup>](pos11.htm#82-1)

The Commentaries say that when he had finished, she attained
Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and
meaning. But according to the Apadāna, she was established only in the
Fruit of one who has entered the Stream, and, the King consenting,
entered the Order ere she became an Arahant.
[<sup>265</sup>](pos11.htm#82-2)

Thereafter she became known for her great insight, and was ranked
foremost herein by the Exalted One, seated in the conclave of Ariyans at
the Jeta Grove Vihāra.

And as she sat one day in siesta under a tree, Māra the Evil One, in
youthful shape, drew near, tempting her with sensuous ideas:

### <span id="LIII">LIII Sujātā.</span>

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and accumulating
good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, and
consolidating the essential conditions for emancipation, was, in this
Buddha-era, reborn at Sāketa, in the Treasurer's family. Given by her
parents in marriage to a Treasurer's son of equal rank, she lived
happily with him. Going one day to take part in an Astral Festival
[<sup>271</sup>](pos11.htm#84-2) in the pleasure-grounds, she was
returning with her attendants to the town, when, in the Añjana Grove,
she saw the Master, and her heart being drawn to him, she drew near, did
obeisance, and seated herself. The Master, finishing his discourse in
order, and knowing the sound state of her mind, expounded the Norm to
her in an inspiring lesson. Thereat, because her intelligence was fully
ripe, she, even as she sat, attained Arahantship, together with thorough
grasp of the Norm in form and meaning. Saluting the Master, and going
home, she obtained her husband's and her parents' consent, and by
command of the Master was admitted to the Order of Bhikkhunīs.
Reflecting on her attainment, she exulted thus:

### <span id="LIV">LIV Anopamā.</span>

She, too, having made resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good
of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, perfecting the
conditions tending to bring about emancipation, was, in this Buddha-era,
reborn at Sāketa as the daughter of the Treasurer, Majjha. Because of
her beauty she got the name 'Peerless' (An-opamā). When she grew up,
many rich men's sons, Kings' ministers, and Princes, sent messengers to
the father, saying: 'Give us your daughter Anopamā, and we will give
this, or that.' Hearing of this, she–for that the promise of the highest
was in her–thought: 'Profit to me in the life of the House there is
none'; and sought the Master's presence. She heard him teach, and her
intelligence maturing, the memory of that teaching, and the strenuous
effort for insight she made, established her in the Third Path–that of
No-return. Asking the Master for admission, she was by his order
admitted among the Bhikkhunīs. And on the seventh day thereafter, she
realized Arahantship. Reflecting thereon, she exulted:

### <span id="LV">LV Mahā-Pajāpatī the Gotamid.</span>

Now she was born, when Padumuttara was Buddha, in the city of Haŋsavatī,
in a clansman's family. Hearing the Master preaching, and assigning the
foremost place for experience to a certain Bhikkhunī, she vowed such a
place should one day be hers. Then, after many births, once more was she
reborn in the Buddha-empty era, between Kassapa and our Buddha, at
Benares, as the forewoman among 500 slave-girls.
[<sup>274</sup>](pos11.htm#87-1) Now, when the rains drew near, five
Silent Buddhas came down from the Nandamūlaka mountain-cave to
Isipatana, seeking alms; and those women got their husbands to erect
five huts for the Buddhas during the three rainy months, and they
provided them with all they required during that time. Reborn once more
in a weaver's village near Benares, in the headman's family, she again
ministered to Silent Buddhas. Finally, she was reborn, shortly before
our Master came to us, at Devadaha, in the family of Mahā-Suppabuddha.
[<sup>275</sup>](pos11.htm#88-1) Her family name was Gotama, and she was
the younger sister of the Great Māyā. And the interpreters of birthmarks
declared that the children of both sisters would be Wheel-rolling
Rulers.[<sup>276</sup>](pos11.htm#88-2) Now, King Suddhodana, when he
came of age, held a festival, and wedded both the sisters. After this,
when our Master had arisen, and, in turning the excellent wheel of the
Norm, came in course of fostering souls to Vesāli, his father, who had
reached Arahantship, died.

Then the great Pajāpatī, wishing to leave the world, asked the Master
for admission, but obtained it not. Then she cut off her hair, put on
the robes, and at the end of the sermon now forming the Suttanta on
strife and contention, she sallied forth, and together with 500 Sākya
ladies whose husbands had renounced the world, went to Vesālī, and asked
the Master, through Ānanda the Thera, for ordination. This she then
obtained, with the eight maxims for Bhikkhunīs.

Thus ordained, the Great Pajāpatī came and saluted the Master, and stood
on one side. Then he taught her the Norm; and she, exercising herself
and practising, soon after obtained Arahantship, accompanied by
intuitive and analytical knowledge. The remaining 500 Bhikkhunīs, after
Nandaka's homily, became endowed with the six branches of intuitive
knowledge.

Now, one day, when the Master was seated in the conclave of Ariyans at
the great Jeta Grove Vihāra, he assigned the foremost place in
experience to Great Pajāpatī, the Gotamid. She, dwelling in the bliss of
fruition and of Nibbana, testified her gratitude one day by declaring
her A<span class="small">ÑÑĀ</span> before the Master, in praising his
virtue, who had brought help where before there had been none:

### <span id="LVI">LVI Guttā.</span>

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and accumulating
good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, and
consolidating the essential conditions for emancipation, was, in this
Buddha-era, reborn at Sāvatthī, in a brahmin's family, and named Guttā.
When adolescent, life in the house became repugnant to her, and she
obtained her parents' consent to enter the Order under the Great
Pajāpatī. Thereafter, though she practised with devotion, her heart long
persisted in running after external interests, and this destroyed
concentration. Then the Master, to encourage her, sent forth glory, and
appeared near her, as if seated in the air, saying these words:

<td><strong></strong>
<p><span id="163">Bethink thee, Guttā, of that high reward</span> <a href="pos11.htm#90-1"><sup>280</sup></a><br />
For which thou wast content to lose thy world,<br />
Renouncing hope of children, lure of wealth.<br />
To <em>that</em> direct and consecrate the mind,<br />
Nor give thyself to sway of truant thoughts. (163)<br />
<span id="164">Deceivers ever are the thoughts of men,<br />
Fain for the haunts where Māra finds his prey;<br />
And running ever on from birth to birth,<br />
To the dread circle bound–a witless world. (164)</span><br />
<span id="165">But thou, O Sister, bound to other goals,<br />
Thine is't to break those Fetters five: the lust<br />
Of sense, ill-will, delusion of the Self,<br />
The taint of rites and ritual, and doubt, (165)</span><br />
<span id="166">That drag thee backward to the hither shore.<br />
'Tis not for thee to come again to this! (166)</span><br />
<span id="167">Get thee away from life-lust,</span><a href="pos11.htm#91-1"><sup>281</sup></a> from conceit,<br />
From ignorance, and from distraction's craze;<br />
Sunder the bonds; so only shalt thou come<br />
To utter end of Ill. Throw off the Chain (167)<br />
<span id="168">Of birth and death–thou knowest what they mean.<br />
So, free from craving, in this life on earth,<br />
Thou shalt go on thy way calm and serene. (168)</span></p></td>

And when the Master had made an end of that utterance, the Sister
attained Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form
and meaning. And exulting thereon, she uttered those lines in their
order as spoken by the Exalted One, whence they came to be called the
Therī's psalm.

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up
good of age-enduring efficacy, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at
Rājagaha, in a certain clansman's family. When grown up she became the
companion of Khemā, afterwards Therī, but then of the laity. Hearing
that Khemā had renounced the world, she said: 'If she, as a King's
consort, can leave the world, surely I can.' So to Khemā Therī she went,
and the latter, discerning whereon her heart was set, taught her the
Norm so as to agitate her mind concerning rebirth, and to make her seek
comfort in the system. And so it came to pass; and the Therī ordained
her. She, serving as was due, and studying as was due, grew in insight,
and, the promise being in her, soon attained to Arahantship, together
with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and meaning. And she, reflecting
thereon, exulted thus:
