PSALM OF NINE VERSES </A></H2>
<H3 align=center><A NAME="LXII">LXII<BR>Va&#x1E0D;&#x1E0D;ha's Mother
</A></H3>


<P>
S<small>HE</small>, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, till the preparation for achieving emancipation was gradually become perfect, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at the town of Bh&#x0101;rukaccha, <A HREF="pos14.htm#103-1"><sup>304</sup></A> in a clansman's family. When married, she bore one son, and he was given the name Va&#x1E0D;&#x1E0D;ha. From that time she was known as Va&#x1E0D;&#x1E0D;ha's mother. Hearing a Bhikkhu preach, she became a believer, and, handing her child over to her kin, she went to the Bhikkhun&#x012B;s, and entered the Order. The rest, not told here, may be filled in from Brother Va&#x1E0D;&#x1E0D;ha's story told in the Psalms of the Elder Brethren (Ps. ccii.). Va&#x1E0D;&#x1E0D;ha, to see his mother, went alone into and through the Bhikkhun&#x012B;s' quarters and she, saying, 'Why have you come in here alone?' admonished him as follows:

O nevermore, my Va&#x1E0D;&#x1E0D;ha, do thou stray <BR>
Into the jungle of this world's desires.<BR>
Child of my heart! come thou not back and forth <BR>
To share, reborn, in all the ills of life. (204)</A><BR><A NAME="205">
True happiness, O Va&#x1E0D;&#x1E0D;ha mine, is theirs <BR>
Who, wise and freed from longing and from doubt,<BR>
Cool and serene, have tamed the craving will,<BR>
And dwell immune from all the deadly drugs. (205)</A><BR><A NAME="206">
The Way that Sages such as these have trod&#8211;<BR>
Leading to that pure vision how they may <BR>
Make a sure end of Ill&#8211;do thou, dear lad, <BR>
Study and cause to grow <A HREF="pos14.htm#104-1"><sup>305</sup></A> to thine own weal. (206)</A>
</p></TD></TR>
</TABLE></B>

<P>
And Va&#x1E0D;&#x1E0D;ha, thinking, 'My mother is surely established in Arahantship,' expressed himself thus:

<B><P><A NAME="207">
Now in good hope and faith thou speakest thus, <BR>
O little mother! well I trow, for thee.<BR>
Dear mother mine, no jungle bars the way. (207)</p></TD></TR>

<P>
Then the Ther&#x012B; replied, showing her work was done:

<TABLE align=center>
<TR><TD>
<B><P><A NAME="208">
Ah, no! my Va&#x1E0D;&#x1E0D;ha, whatsoe'er I do,<BR>
Or say, or think, in things or great or small, <BR>
Not e'en the smallest growth of jungly vice <A HREF="pos14.htm#104-2"><sup>306</sup></A><BR>
Yet standeth in the onward way for me. (208)</A><BR><A NAME="209">
For all the deadly poison-plants are killed<BR>
In me who meditate with strenuous zeal. <BR>
The Threefold Wisdom have I gotten now,<BR>
And all the Buddha's word have I fulfilled. (209)</p></TD></TR>

<P>
The Brother, using her exhortation as a goad, and stimulated thereby, went to his Vih&#x0101;ra, and, seated in his wonted resting-place, so made insight to grow that he attained Arahantship. And reflecting in happiness on his attainment, he went to his mother, and declared his A<small>&Ntilde;&Ntilde;&#x0100;</small>:

O splendid was the spur my mother used, <BR>
And no less merciful the chastisement<BR>
She gave to me, even the rune she spoke, <BR>
Fraught with its burden of sublimest good.</A> <A HREF="pos14.htm#105-1"><sup>307</sup></A> (210)<BR><A NAME="211">
I heard her words, I marked her counsel wise, <BR>
And thrilled with righteous awe as she called up <BR>
The vision of salvation to be won. (211)</A><BR><A NAME="212">
And night and day I strove unweariedly <BR>
Until her admonitions bore their fruit, <BR>
And I could touch Nibbana's utter peace. (212)</A>
