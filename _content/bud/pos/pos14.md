## <span id="C-IX">CANTO IX PSALM OF NINE VERSES</span>

### <span id="LXII">LXII Vaḍḍha's Mother</span>

S<span class="small">HE</span>, too, having made her resolve under
former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and
that rebirth, till the preparation for achieving emancipation was
gradually become perfect, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at the town of
Bhārukaccha, [<sup>304</sup>](pos14.htm#103-1) in a clansman's family.
When married, she bore one son, and he was given the name Vaḍḍha. From
that time she was known as Vaḍḍha's mother. Hearing a Bhikkhu preach,
she became a believer, and, handing her child over to her kin, she went
to the Bhikkhunīs, and entered the Order. The rest, not told here, may
be filled in from Brother Vaḍḍha's story told in the Psalms of the Elder
Brethren (Ps. ccii.). Vaḍḍha, to see his mother, went alone into and
through the Bhikkhunīs' quarters and she, saying, 'Why have you come in
here alone?' admonished him as follows:

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<p><span id="204">O nevermore, my Vaḍḍha, do thou stray<br />
Into the jungle of this world's desires.<br />
Child of my heart! come thou not back and forth<br />
To share, reborn, in all the ills of life. (204)</span><br />
<span id="205">True happiness, O Vaḍḍha mine, is theirs<br />
Who, wise and freed from longing and from doubt,<br />
Cool and serene, have tamed the craving will,<br />
And dwell immune from all the deadly drugs. (205)</span><br />
<span id="206">The Way that Sages such as these have trod–<br />
Leading to that pure vision how they may<br />
Make a sure end of Ill–do thou, dear lad,<br />
Study and cause to grow</span> <a href="pos14.htm#104-1"><sup>305</sup></a> to thine own weal. (206)</p></td>

And Vaḍḍha, thinking, 'My mother is surely established in Arahantship,'
expressed himself thus:

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
Now in good hope and faith thou speakest thus,<br />
O little mother! well I trow, for thee.<br />
Dear mother mine, no jungle bars the way. (207)</td>

Then the Therī replied, showing her work was done:

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong></strong>
<span id="208">Ah, no! my Vaḍḍha, whatsoe'er I do,<br />
Or say, or think, in things or great or small,<br />
Not e'en the smallest growth of jungly vice</span> <a href="pos14.htm#104-2"><sup>306</sup></a><br />
Yet standeth in the onward way for me. (208)<br />

For all the deadly poison-plants are killed<br />
In me who meditate with strenuous zeal.<br />
The Threefold Wisdom have I gotten now,<br />
And all the Buddha's word have I fulfilled. (209)</td>

The Brother, using her exhortation as a goad, and stimulated thereby,
went to his Vihāra, and, seated in his wonted resting-place, so made
insight to grow that he attained Arahantship. And reflecting in
happiness on his attainment, he went to his mother, and declared his

The vision of salvation to be won. (211)</span><br />

Until her admonitions bore their fruit,<br />
