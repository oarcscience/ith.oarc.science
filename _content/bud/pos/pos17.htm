<P>
S<small>HE</small>, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, was, when Vipassi was Buddha, reborn in a clansman's family. Come to years of discretion, because of the promise that was in her, she waxed anxious at the prospect of rebirth, and, going to the Bhikkhun&#x012B;s, heard the Norm, believed, and entered the Order. Perfect in virtue, and learning the Three Pitakas, she became very learned in the Norm, and a teacher of it. The same destiny befell her under the five succeeding Buddhas&#8211;Sikhi, Vessabhu, Kakusandha, Ko&#x1E47;&#x0101;gamana, and Kassapa. But because of her tendency to pride, she was unable to root out the defilements. <A HREF="pos17.htm#116-2"><sup>330</sup></A> So it came to pass, through the karma of her pride, that, in this Buddha-era, she was reborn at S&#x0101;vatth&#x012B;, in the household of An&#x0101;thapi&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;ika, the Treasurer, of a domestic slave. She became a Stream-entrant after hearing the discourse of the Lion's Roar. <A HREF="pos17.htm#117-1"><sup>331</sup></A> Afterwards, when she had converted (lit. tamed) the baptist <A HREF="pos17.htm#117-2"><sup>332</sup></A> brahmin, and so won her master's esteem that he made her a freed woman, she obtained his consent, as her guardian and head of her home, to enter the Order. And, practising insight, she in no long time won Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning. Reflecting on her attainment, she uttered these verses in exultation:

Drawer of water, I down to the stream, <A HREF="pos17.htm#117-3"><sup>333</sup></A> <BR>
Even in winter, went in fear of blows,<BR>
Harassed by fear of blame from mistresses. (236)</A><BR><A NAME="237">
<BR>
'What, brahmin, fearest thou that ever thus <BR>
Thou goest down into the river? Why<BR>
With shiv'ring limbs dost suffer bitter cold?' (237)</A><BR><A NAME="238">
<BR>
'Well know'st thou, damsel Pu&#x1E47;&#x1E47;ik&#x0101;, why ask <BR>
One who by righteous karma thus annuls <BR>
Effect of evil karma? Who in youth, (238)</A><BR><A NAME="239">
Or age ill deeds hath wrought, by baptism <BR>
Of water from that karma is released.' (239)</A><BR><A NAME="240">
<BR>
'Nay now, who, ignorant to the ignorant, <BR>
Hath told thee this: that water-baptism <BR>
From evil karma can avail to free? (240)</A><BR><A NAME="241">
Why then the fishes <A HREF="pos17.htm#117-4"><sup>334</sup></A> and the tortoises,<BR>
The frogs, the watersnakes, the crocodiles <BR>
And all that haunt the water straight to heaven (241)</A><BR><A NAME="242">
Will go. Yea, all who evil karma work&#8211; <BR>
Butchers of sheep and swine, hunters of game, <BR>
Thieves, murderers&#8211;so they but splash themselves <BR>
With water, are from evil karma free! (242)</A><BR><A NAME="243">
And if these streams could bear away what erst <BR>
Of evil thou hast wrought, they'd bear away <BR>
Thy merit too, leaving thee stripped and bare. (243)</A><BR><A NAME="244">
That, dreading which, thou, brahmin, comest e'er <BR>
To bathe and shiver here, that, even that <BR>
Leave thou undone, and save thy skin from frost.' (244)</A><BR><A NAME="245">
<BR>
'Men who in error's ways had gone aside <BR>
Thou leadest now into the Ariyan Path. <BR>
Damsel, my bathing raiment give I thee.' (245)</A><BR><A NAME="246">
<BR>
'Keep thou thy raiment! Raiment seek I none. <BR>
If ill thou fearest, if thou like it not, (246)</A><BR><A NAME="247">
Do thou no open, nor no hidden wrong. <BR>
But if thou shalt do evil, or hast done, (247)</A><BR><A NAME="248">
Then is there no escape for thee from ill, <BR>
E'en tho' thou see it come, and flee away. <BR>
If thou fear ill, if ill delight thee not, (248)</A><BR><A NAME="249">
Go thou and seek the Buddha and the Norm <BR>
And Order for thy refuge; learn of them <BR>
To keep the Precepts. Thus shalt thou find good.' (249)</A><BR><A NAME="250">
<BR>
'Lo! to the Buddha I for refuge go, <BR>
And to the Norm and Order. I will learn<BR>
Of them to take upon myself and keep <BR>
The Precepts; so shall I indeed find good. (250)</A><BR><A NAME="251">
<BR>
Once but a son of brahmins born was I, <BR>
To-day I stand brahmin in very deed. <BR>
The nobler Threefold Wisdom have I won, <BR>
Won the true Veda-lore, and graduate <BR>
Am I, from better Sacrament returned, <BR>
Cleansed by the inward spiritual bath.' <A HREF="pos17.htm#119-1"><sup>335</sup></A> (251)</p></TD></TR>

<P>
For the brahmin, established in the Refuges and the Precepts, when later he had heard the Master preach the Norm, became a believer and entered the Order. Using every effort, he not long after became Thrice-Wise, <A HREF="pos17.htm#119-2"><sup>336</sup></A> and, reflecting on his state, exulted in those verses. And the Sister, repeating them of herself, they all became her Psalm.

<sup>329</sup> The Commentary gives her the latter name, of which the former is the diminutive. Possibly Pu&#x1E47;&#x1E47;ik&#x0101; may have been used to distinguish her from the Ther&#x012B; Pu&#x1E47;&#x1E47;&#x0101; of <A HREF="pos06.htm#III">Ps. iii.</A> It is curious that in the Subha-Sutta of the <I>Majjhima Nik&#x0101;ya</I>, where young brahmins come to the Jeta Grove, An&#x0101;thapi&#x1E47;&#x1E0D;ika's gift, to interview the Buddha, a slave-girl Pu&#x1E47;&#x1E47;ik&#x0101; is alluded to in the conversation. Subha says: 'They [certain brahmin teachers] are not able to read the thoughts of slave-girl Pu&#x1E47;&#x1E47;ik&#x0101;. How should they be able to know the minds of all recluses?' If this is our Pu&#x1E47;&#x1E47;ik&#x0101;, she would not yet be a Ther&#x012B;, or she would be referred to as such.
