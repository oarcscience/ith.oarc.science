She too became the friend of S&#x0101;m&#x0101;vat&#x012B;, and she too, out of grief at the death of the latter, entered the Order. She too could not gain self-mastery for twenty-five years, till in her old age she heard a timely sermon, through which her insight expanded and she won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Dhamma in form and meaning. Thereon reflecting, she broke forth:

She, too, heaping up good under former Buddhas, was in the time of Vipassi Buddha, born at Bandhumat&#x012B;, in the house of a certain wealthy landowner, and became a domestic servant. Grown up, she tended her master's household. Now, at that time, King Bandhum&#x0101; (Vipassi's father), having restored Sabbath-keeping, gave gifts before dining and, after dining, attended a sermon; and the people, following his pious example, and keeping Sabbath, the slave thought: 'Why should not I, too, do as they all are doing?' And for the thoroughness of her observance of the feasts she was reborn among the Three-and-Thirty gods, and in other happy realms, and finally, in this Buddha-era, in the house of the Treasurer of S&#x0101;vatth&#x012B;. Come to years of discretion, she heard Pa&#x1E6D;&#x0101;c&#x0101;r&#x0101; preach, and entered the Order; but she was unable to attain the climax of insight till Pa&#x1E6D;&#x0101;c&#x0101;r&#x0101;,<A HREF="pos08.htm#35-2"><sup>149</sup></A> seeing the state of her mind, gave her admonition.

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, was born, in the time of Vipassi Buddha, as a domestic servant, at Bandhumat&#x012B;. One day, seeing an Arahant of the Master's Order seeking alms, she gladly offered him three sweet cakes. Through this reborn to happiness, she finally came to birth, in this Buddha-era, in
the family of an eminent brahmin in the country of Kosala. Come to years of discretion, she heard the Master preach while touring in the country, and leaving the world, she soon won Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning.

She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and in this and that rebirth heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy, was born, when the world was empty of a Buddha, as a fairy by the River Candabh&#x0101;g&#x0101;.<A HREF="pos08.htm#37-3"><sup>153</sup></A> Sporting one day with the fairies, and straying awhile, she saw a silent
Buddha seated at the foot of a tree, and adored him in faith with flower-offerings. For this she was reborn among gods and men, and, finally, in this Buddha-era, at S&#x0101;vatth&#x012B;, in the house of the King's chaplain-brahmin. Come to years of discretion, she became a lay-believer in the Jeta Grove [College], and, later, entered the Order under Great Paj&#x0101;pat&#x012B;  the Gotamid. And one day, while staying at R&#x0101;jagaha, she ascended the Vulture's Peak, after her meal, and while resting, she saw that which she tells of in her verse, whereby she won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning.

She too, having made her resolve in the time of former Buddhas, and heaping up, in this and that rebirth, Good valid <!-- sic --> for an &aelig;on of evolution, was born, in the time of
Padumuttara Buddha, at the town of Ha&#x014B;savat&#x012B; in a clansman's house. Come to years of discretion, she was left alone one day, her parents being engaged with a party in the inner court of the house. And seeing an Arahant approaching the house-door, she bade him 'Come in hither, lord,' and did him homage, showing him to a seat; she then took his bowl and filled it with food. The Elder thanked her, and departed. But she, reborn therefore in the heaven of the Three-and-Thirty gods, enjoying there a heavenly time and many a happy life thereafter, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at S&#x0101;vatth&#x012B; in the family of a very eminent burgess. And she was beautiful to see, and was brought into the house of the King of Kosala himself.<A HREF="pos08.htm#39-1"><sup>156</sup></A> After a few years a daughter was born to her, whom she named J&#x012B;v&#x0101;.<A HREF="pos08.htm#39-2"><sup>157</sup></A>  The King saw the child, and was so pleased that he had Ubbir&#x012B; anointed as Queen. But anon the little girl died, and the mother went daily mourning to the charnel-field. And one day she went and worshipped the Master, and sat down; but soon she left, and stood lamenting by the River Achiravat&#x012B;. Then the Master, seeing her from afar, revealed himself, and asked her: 'Why dost thou weep?' 'I weep because of my daughter, Exalted One.' 'Burnt in this cemetery are some 84,000 <A HREF="pos08.htm#39-3"><sup>158</sup></A> of thy daughters. For which of them dost thou weep?' And pointing out the place where this one and that one had been laid, he said half the psalm:
</P>


<TABLE align=center>

O Ubbir&#x012B;, who wailest in the wood, <BR>
Crying 'O J&#x012B;v&#x0101;! O my daughter dear!' <BR>

Are burnt full many a thousand daughters dear, <BR>
And all of them were named like unto her.<BR>
Now which of all those J&#x012B;v&#x0101;s dost thou mourn? (51)</A>

And she pondered with intelligence on the Norm thus taught by the Master, and so stirred up insight that, by the charm of his teaching and her own attainment of the requisite conditions, she reached the topmost fruit, even Arahantship.<A HREF="pos08.htm#40-1"><sup>159</sup></A> And showing forth the high distinction she had won, she spoke the second half of the psalm:

She, too, having fared in the past as the foregoing Sisters, was born in a clansman's house. <A HREF="pos08.htm#40-4"><sup>162</sup></A> Come to years of discretion, she went with lay-women disciples to the Vih&#x0101;ra, <A HREF="pos08.htm#40-5"><sup>163</sup></A> and heard the Master preach. Becoming a believer, she left the world and became learned, proficient in the doctrine, and a ready speaker. Leading for centuries a religious life, <A HREF="pos08.htm#41-1"><sup>164</sup></A> she yet died a worldling at heart, and was reborn in the heaven of bliss.<A HREF="pos08.htm#41-2"><sup>165</sup></A> Again, when Vipassi was Buddha, and again when Vessabhu was Buddha, she kept the precepts, and was learned and proficient in doctrine. Again, when Kakusandha was Buddha, and yet again when Kon&#x0101;gamana was Buddha, she took Orders, and was pure in conduct, learn&egrave;d, and a preacher. At length, she was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at R&#x0101;jagaha, in the family of an eminent burgess, and called Sukk&#x0101; (bright, lustrous, 'Lucy'). Come to years of discretion, she found faith in the Master at her own home, and became a lay-disciple. But later, when she heard Dhammadinn&#x0101; preach,<A HREF="pos08.htm#41-3"><sup>166</sup></A> she was thrilled with emotion, and renounced the world under her. And performing the exercises for insight, she not long after attained Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning.
</P>

<P>
Thereupon, attended by 500 Bhikkhun&#x012B;s, she became a great preacher. And one day, when they had been into R&#x0101;jagaha for alms, and had returned and dined, they entered the Bhikkhun&#x012B;s' settlement, and Sukk&#x0101;, with a great company seated around her, taught the doctrine in such wise that she seemed to be giving them sweet mead to drink and sprinkling them with ambrosia. And they all listened to her rapt, motionless, intent. Thereupon the spirit<A HREF="pos08.htm#41-4"><sup>167</sup></A> of the tree that stood at the end of the Sisters' terrace was inspired by her teaching, and went out to R&#x0101;jagaha, walking about the ways and the squares proclaiming her excellence, and saying:
</P>

<TABLE align=center>

And hearing what the tree-spirit said, the people were excited, and came to the Sister and listened attentively.

With him she lived happily till his death. Then, being herself advanced in years, and growing anxious as she sought to find Good, <A HREF="pos08.htm#42-3"><sup>170</sup></A> she went about from park to park, <A HREF="pos08.htm#42-4"><sup>171</sup></A> from vih&#x0101;ra to vih&#x0101;ra, with the intention of teaching religion (<I>dhamma</I>) to votaries of religion.

Scarce had the thought arisen when the Tree blazed forth, the branches appeared as if made of gold, the horizon shone all around. And she, inspired at that sight, fell down and worshipped, and for seven days sat there. On the seventh day she performed a grand feast of offering and worship to the Buddha.<A HREF="pos08.htm#43-2"><sup>173</sup></A> By this meritorious karma she was reborn in this Buddha-era, in the kingdom of &#x0100;&#x1E37;av&#x012B;, as the King's daughter, and named Sel&#x0101;. <A HREF="pos08.htm#43-3"><sup>174</sup></A> But she was also known as 'The &#x0100;&#x1E37;avikan.' <A HREF="pos08.htm#43-4"><sup>175</sup></A> Come to years of discretion, the Master converted her father, ordained him, and went with him to the city of &#x0100;&#x1E37;av&#x012B;.

She, too, having fared in the past as the foregoing Sisters, was, in the time of Sikhi Buddha, <A HREF="pos08.htm#44-3"><sup>179</sup></A>
 reborn in the family of an eminent noble, and, when grown up, was made the chief consort of the King Aru&#x1E47;av&#x0101;. The story of her past is similar to that of Sister Abhay&#x0101;.  <A HREF="pos08.htm#45-1"><sup>180</sup></A>

Come to years of discretion, she came to believe in the Master in her own home, and became a lay-disciple. And later on, growing anxious, she entered the Order of Bhikkhun&#x012B;s, and, working her way to insight, she not long after won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in letter and in spirit.
