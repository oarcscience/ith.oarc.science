<CENTER><H2>The Chinese Classics</H2></CENTER>
These are key texts of Confucianism, the traditional state religion of
feudal China.
These are some of the few Chinese texts which
survived a disasterous book-burning in 213 B.C.E.
by the Emperor Ch'in Shih Huang.

Although three of four of these books
are traditionally attributed to Confucius (K'ung-tzu, 551-479 B.C.E.)
it has been established that
he did not write a single word of them; they were written down by his
students after his death.
The Analects come closest to an actual exposition of his philosophy.
These works were put into their present form by Chu Hsi in the
late twelfth century C.E.
These four books were required reading in order to
pass the civil service exminations, (started in 1315),
which were the gateway to employment in the Imperial bureaucracy.
The translations are by James Legge,
from his 'Chinese Classics' series.
Works traditionally attributed to Confucius, but of uncertain authorship,
have an asterisk following his name.
