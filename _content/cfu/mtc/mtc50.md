### \[49\] LOSING A SLAVE-GIRL

#### *(Date uncertain)*

<span class="smallcaps">Around</span> my garden the little wall is
low;  
In the bailiff's lodge the lists are seldom checked.  
I am ashamed to think we were not always kind;  
I regret your labours, that will never be repaid.  
The caged bird owes no allegiance;  
The wind-tossed flower does not cling to the tree.

Where to-night she lies none can give us news;  
Nor any knows, save the bright watching moon.
