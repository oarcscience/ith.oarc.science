### \[15\] WATCHING THE REAPERS

#### (A.D. *806*)

<span class="smallcaps">Tillers</span> of the soil have few idle
months;  
In the fifth month their toil is double-fold.  
A south-wind visits the fields at night:  
Suddenly the hill is covered with yellow corn.  
Wives and daughters shoulder baskets of rice;  
Youths and boys carry the flasks of wine.  
Following after they bring a wage of meat  
To the strong reapers toiling on the southern hill,  
Whose feet are burned by the hot earth they tread,  
Whose backs are scorched by flames of the shining sky.  
Tired they toil, caring nothing for the heat,  
Grudging the shortness of the long summer day.  
A poor woman follows at the reapers' side  
With an infant child carried close at her breast.  
With her right hand she gleans the fallen grain;  
On her left arm a broken basket hangs.  
And *I* to-day… by virtue of what right  
Have I never once tended field or tree?  
My government-pay is three hundred tons;  
At the year's end I have still grain in hand.  
Thinking of this, secretly I grew ashamed;  
And all day the thought lingered in my head.
