### \[52\] ON HIS BALDNESS

#### (A.D. *832*)

<span class="smallcaps">At</span> dawn I sighed to see my hairs fall;  
At dusk I sighed to see my hairs fall.  
For I dreaded the time when the last lock should go…  
They are all gone and I do not mind at all!  
I have done with that cumbrous washing and getting dry;  
My tiresome comb for ever is laid aside.  
Best of all, when the weather is hot and wet,  
To have no top-knot weighing down on one's head!  
I put aside my dusty conical cap;  
    And loose my collar-fringe.  
In a silver jar I have stored a cold stream;  
On my bald pate I trickle a ladle-full.  
Like one baptized with the Water of Buddha's Law,  
I sit and receive this cool, cleansing joy.  
*Now* I know why the priest who seeks Repose  
Frees his heart by first shaving his head.
