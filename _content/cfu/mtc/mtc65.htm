<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">I dreamt</span> I climbed to a high, high plain;<br> And on the plain I found a deep well.<br> My throat was dry with climbing and I longed to drink;<br> And my eyes were eager to look into the cool shaft.<br> I walked round it; I looked right down;<br> I saw my image mirrored on the face of the pool.<br> An earthen pitcher was sinking into the black depths;<br> There was no rope to pull it to the well-head.<br> I was strangely troubled lest the pitcher should be lost,<br> And started wildly running to look for help.<br> From village to village I scoured that high plain;<br> The men were gone: the dogs leapt at my throat.<br> I came back and walked weeping round the well;<br> Faster and faster the blinding tears flowed&#8212;<br> Till my own sobbing suddenly woke me up;<br> My room was silent; no one in the house stirred;<br> The flame of my candle flickered with a green smoke;<br> The tears I had shed glittered in the candle-light.<br> A bell sounded; I knew it was the midnight-chime;<br> I sat up in bed and tried to arrange my thoughts:<br> The plain in my dream was the graveyard at Ch&#8216;ang-an,<br> Those hundred acres of untilled land.<br> The soil heavy and the mounds heaped high;<br> And the dead below them laid in deep troughs.<br> Deep are the troughs, yet sometimes dead men</p>

<p>Find their way to the world above the grave.<br> And to-night my love who died long ago<br> Came into my dream as the pitcher sunk in the well.<br> That was why the tears suddenly streamed from my eyes,<br> Streamed from my eyes and fell on the collar of my dress.</p>
