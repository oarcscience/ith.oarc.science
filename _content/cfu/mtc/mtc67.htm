<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> old days those who went to fight<br> In three years had one year's leave.<br> But in <i>this</i> war the soldiers are never changed;<br> They must go on fighting till they die on the battle-field.<br> I thought of you, so weak and indolent,<br> Hopelessly trying to learn to march and drill.<br> That a young man should ever come home again<br> Seemed about as likely as that the sky should fall.<br> Since I got the news that you were coming back,<br> Twice I have mounted to the high hall of your home.<br> I found your brother mending your horse's stall;<br> I found your mother sewing your new clothes.<br> I am half afraid; perhaps it is not true;<br> Yet I never weary of watching for you on the road.<br> Each day I go out at the City Gate<br> With a flask of wine, lest you should come thirsty.<br> Oh that I could shrink the surface of the World,<br> So that suddenly I might find you standing at my side.</p>
