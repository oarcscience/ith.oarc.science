<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> days of my youth left me long ago;<br> And now in their turn dwindle my years of prime.<br> With what thoughts of sadness and loneliness<br> I walk again in this cold, deserted place!<br> In the midst of the garden long I stand alone;<br> The sunshine, faint; the wind and dew chill.<br> The autumn lettuce is tangled and turned to seed;<br> The fair trees are blighted and withered away.<br> All that is left are a few chrysanthemum-flowers<br> That have newly opened beneath the wattled fence.<br> I had brought wine and meant to fill my cup,<br> When the sight of these made me stay my hand.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, when I was young,<br> How easily my mood changed from sad to gay.<br> If I saw wine, no matter at what season,<br> Before I drank it, my heart was already glad.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that age comes,<br> A moment of joy is harder and harder to get.<br> And always I fear that when I am quite old<br> The strongest liquor will leave me comfortless.<br> Therefore I ask you, late chrysanthemum-flower<br> At this sad season why do you bloom alone?<br> Though well I know that it was not for my sake,<br> Taught by you, for a while I will open my face.</p>
