### \[40\] AFTER COLLECTING THE AUTUMN TAXES

<span class="smallcaps">From</span> my high castle I look at the town
below  
Where the natives of Pa cluster like a swarm of flies.  
How can I govern these people and lead them aright?  
I cannot even understand what they say.  
But at least I am glad, now that the taxes are in,  
To learn that in my province there is no discontent.  
I fear its prosperity is not due to me  
And was only caused by the year's abundant crops,  
The papers that lie on my desk are simple and few;  
My house by the moat is leisurely and still.  
In the autumn rain the berries fall from the eaves;  
At the evening bell the birds return to the wood.  
A broken sunlight quavers over the southern porch  
Where I lie on my couch abandoned to idleness.
