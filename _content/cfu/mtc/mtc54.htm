<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> an idle hour I thought of former days;<br> And former friends seemed to be standing in the room.<br> And then I wondered "Where are they now?"<br> Like fallen leaves they have tumbled to the Nether Springs.<br> Han Y&uuml;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> swallowed his sulphur pills,<br> Yet a single illness carried him straight to the grave.<br> Y&uuml;an Ch&#275;n smelted autumn stone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> But before he was old, his strength crumbled away.<br> Master Tu possessed the "Secret of Health":<br> All day long he fasted from meat and spice.<br> The Lord Ts&#8216;ui, trusting a strong drug,<br> Through the whole winter wore his summer coat.<br> Yet some by illness and some by sudden death&#8230;<br> All vanished ere their middle years were passed.</p>  
<p>Only I, who have never dieted myself<br> Have thus protracted a tedious span of age,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I who in young days<br> Yielded lightly to every lust and greed;<br> Whose palate craved only for the richest meat<br> And knew nothing of bismuth or calomel.<br> When hunger came, I gulped steaming food;<br> When thirst came, I drank from the frozen stream.</p>
