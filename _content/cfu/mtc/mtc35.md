### \[34\] HEARING THE EARLY ORIOLE

#### *(Written in exile)*

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> the sun rose I was still lying in
bed;  
An early oriole sang on the roof of my house.  
For a moment I thought of the Royal Park at dawn  
When the Birds of Spring greeted their Lord from his trees.  
I remembered the days when I served before the Throne  
Pencil in hand, on duty at the Ch‘ēng-ming; <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_22)  
At the height of spring, when I paused an instant from work,  
Morning and evening, was *this* the voice I heard?  
Now in my exile the oriole sings again  
In the dreary stillness of Hsün-yang town…  
The bird's note cannot really have changed;  
All the difference lies in the listener's heart.  
If he could but forget that he lives at the World's end,  
The bird would sing as it sang in the Palace of old.
