### \[9\] TO TAN CH‘IU

<span class="smallcaps">My</span> friend is lodging high in the Eastern
Range,  
Dearly loving the beauty of valleys and hills.  
At green Spring he lies in the empty woods,  
And is still asleep when the sun shines on high.  
A pine-tree wind dusts his sleeves and coat;  
A pebbly stream cleans his heart and ears.  
I envy you, who far from strife and talk  
Are high-propped on a pillow of blue cloud.
