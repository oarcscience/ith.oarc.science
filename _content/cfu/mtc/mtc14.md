### \[13\] IN EARLY SUMMER LODGING IN A TEMPLE TO ENJOY THE MOONLIGHT

#### (A.D. *805*)

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> early summer, with two or three more  
That were seeking fame in the city of Ch‘ang-an,  
Whose low employ gave them less business  
Than ever they had since first they left their homes,—  
With these I wandered deep into the shrine of Tao,  
For the joy we sought was promised in this place.  
When we reached the gate, we sent our coaches back;  
We entered the yard with only cap and stick.  
Still and clear, the first weeks of May,  
When trees are green and bushes soft and wet;  
When the wind has stolen the shadows of new leaves  
And birds linger on the last boughs that bloom.  
Towards evening when the sky grew clearer yet  
And the South-east was still clothed in red,  
To the western cloister we carried our jar of wine;  
While we waited for the moon, our cups moved slow.  
Soon, how soon her golden ghost was born,  
Swiftly, as though she had waited for us to come.  
The beams of her light shone in every place,  
On towers and halls dancing to and fro.  
Till day broke we sat in her clear light  
Laughing and singing, and yet never grew tired.  
In Ch‘ang-an, the place of profit and fame,  
Such moods as this, how many men know?
