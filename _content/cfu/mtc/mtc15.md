### \[14\] SICK LEAVE

#### *(While Secretary to the Deputy-Assistant-Magistrate of Chou-chih, near Ch‘ang-an, in A.D. 806)*

<span class="smallcaps">Propped</span> on pillows, not attending to
business;  
For two days I've lain behind locked doors.  
I begin to think that those who hold office  
Get no rest, except by falling ill!  
For restful thoughts one does not need space;  
The room where I lie is ten foot square.  
By the western eaves, above the bamboo-twigs,  
From my couch I see the White Mountain rise.  
But the clouds that hover on its far-distant peak  
Bring shame to a face that is buried in the World's dust.
