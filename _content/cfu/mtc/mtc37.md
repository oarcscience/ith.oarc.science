### \[36\] THE FIFTEENTH VOLUME

#### *(Having completed the fifteenth volume of his works, the poet sends it to his friends Yüan Chēn and Li Chien, with a jesting poem.)*

#### *(Written in 818)*

<span class="smallcaps">My</span> long poem, the "Eternal Grief," <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_23) is a beautiful and moving work;  
My ten "Songs of Shensi" are models of tunefulness.  
I cannot prevent Old Yüan from stealing my best rhymes;  
But I earnestly beg Little Li to respect my ballads and songs.  
While I am alive riches and honour will never fall to my lot;  
But well I know that after I am dead the fame of my books will live.  
This random talk and foolish boasting forgive me, for to-day  
I have added Volume Fifteen to the row that stands to my name.
