### \[55\] OLD AGE

#### *(Addressed to Liu Yü-hsi, who was born in the same year)*

#### (A.D. *835*)

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> are growing old together, you and I,  
Let us ask ourselves, what is age like?  
The dull eye is closed ere night comes;  
The idle head, still uncombed at noon.  
Propped on a staff, sometimes a walk abroad;  
Or all day sitting with closed doors.  
One dares not look in the mirror's polished face;  
One cannot read small-letter books.  
Deeper and deeper, one's love of old friends;  
Fewer and fewer, one's dealings with young men.  
One thing only, the pleasure of idle talk,  
Is great as ever, when you and I meet.
