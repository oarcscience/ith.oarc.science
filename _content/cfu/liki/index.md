# The LÎ KÎ (THE BOOK OF RITES) Part I

## Translated by James Legge

## \[1885\]

### Sacred Books of the East vol. 27

#### The Sacred Books of China vol. 4

The Li Ki is one of the 'Five Chinese Classics'. This title is usually
translated the Book of Rites. The work is a compilation of assorted
texts which describe Chinese religious practices from the eighth to the
fifth century B.C. It was first written down about 200 B.C.

This work is of interest because of the minute description of Chinese
culture from this period, including funerary rites, clothing,
cosmological theories, astronomy, economy, geography, history, family
structure, the Imperial court, music, crime and punishment,
horticulture, and even some exotic recipes.

This is the first volume of the Li Ki.
