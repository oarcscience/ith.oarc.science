<p>1. Chwang P&acirc;'o, seeing Mencius, said to him, 'I had an interview with
the king. His Majesty told me that he loved music, and I was not prepared
with anything to reply to him. What do you pronounce about that love of
music?' Mencius replied, 'If the king's love of music were very great, the
kingdom of Ch'&icirc; would be near to a state of good government!'</p>

<p>2. Another day, Mencius, having an interview with the king, said, 'Your
Majesty, I have heard, told the officer Chwang, that you love music;-- was
it so?' The king changed colour, and said, 'I am unable to love the music
of the ancient sovereigns; I only love the music that suits the manners of
the present age.'</p>

<p>3. Mencius said, 'If your Majesty's love of music were very great,
Ch'&icirc; would be near to a state of good government! The music of the
present day is just like the music of antiquity, as regards effecting
that.'</p>

<p>4. The king said, 'May I hear from you the proof of that?'  Mencius asked,
'Which is the more pleasant,-- to enjoy music by yourself alone, or to enjoy
it with others?' 'To enjoy it with others,' was the reply. 'And which is
the more pleasant,-- to enjoy music with a few, or to enjoy it with many?'
'To enjoy it with many.'</p>

<p>5. Mencius proceeded, 'Your servant begs to explain what I have said about
music to your Majesty.</p>

<p>6. 'Now, your Majesty is having music here.-- The people hear the noise of
your bells and drums, and the notes of your fifes and pipes, and they all,
with aching heads, knit their brows, and say to one another, "That's how
our king likes his music! But why does he reduce us to this extremity of
distress?-- Fathers and sons cannot see one another. Elder brothers and
younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and scattered abroad."
Now, your Majesty is hunting here.-- The people hear the noise of your
carriages and horses, and see the beauty of your plumes and streamers, and
they all, with aching heads, knit their brows, and say to one another,
"That's how our king likes his hunting! But why does he reduce us to this
extremity of distress?-- Fathers and sons cannot see one another. Elder
brothers and younger brothers, wives and children, are separated and
scattered abroad." Their feeling thus is from no other reason but that you
do not allow the people to have pleasure as well as yourself.</p>

<p>7. 'Now, your Majesty is having music here. The people hear the noise of
your bells and drums, and the notes of your fifes and pipes, and they all,
delighted, and with joyful looks, say to one another, "That sounds as if
our king were free from all sickness! If he were not, how could he enjoy
this music?" Now, your Majesty is hunting here.-- The people hear the noise
of your carriages and horses, and see the beauty of your plumes and
streamers, and they all, delighted, and with joyful looks, say to one
another, "That looks as if our king were free from all sickness! If he
were not, how could he enjoy this hunting?" Their feeling thus is from no
other reason but that you cause them to have their pleasure as you have
yours.</p>

<p>8. 'If your Majesty now will make pleasure a thing common to the people
and yourself, the royal sway awaits you.'</p>



<p>1. The king Hs&uuml;an of Ch'&icirc; asked, 'Was it so, that the park of 
king Wan contained seventy square l&icirc;?' Mencius replied, 'It is so 
in the records.'</p>

<p>2. 'Was it so large as that?' exclaimed the king. 'The people,' said
Mencius, 'still looked on it as small.' The king added, 'My park contains
only forty square l&icirc;, and the people still look on it as large. How
is this?' 'The park of king Wan,' was the reply, 'contained seventy square
l&icirc;, but the grass-cutters and fuel-gatherers had the privilege of
entrance into it; so also had the catchers of pheasants and hares. He
shared it with the people, and was it not with reason that they looked on
it as small?</p>

<p>3. 'When I first arrived at the borders of your kingdom, I inquired about
the great prohibitory regulations, before I would venture to enter it; and
I heard, that inside the barrier-gates there was a park of forty square
l&icirc;, and that he who killed a deer in it, was held guilty of the same
crime as if he had killed a man.-- Thus those forty square l&icirc; are a
pitfall in the middle of the kingdom. Is it not with reason that the people
look upon them as large?'</p>



<p>1. The king Hs&uuml;an of Ch'&icirc; asked, saying, 'Is there any way to
regulate one's maintenance of intercourse with neighbouring kingdoms?'
Mencius replied, 'There is. But it requires a perfectly virtuous prince to
be able, with a great country, to serve a small one,-- as, for instance,
T'ang served Ko, and king Wan served the Kwan barbarians.  And it requires
a wise prince to be able, with a small country, to serve a large one,-- as
the king T'&acirc;i served the Hs&uuml;n-y&uuml;, and K&acirc;u-ch'ien
served W&ucirc;.</p>

<p>2. 'He who with a areat State serves a small one, delights in Heaven. He
who with a small State serves a large one, stands in awe of Heaven. He who
delights in Heaven, will affect with his love and protection the whole
kingdom. He who stands in awe of Heaven, will affect with his love and
protection his own kingdom.</p>

<p>3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, "I fear the Majesty of Heaven, and
will thus preserve its favouring decree."'</p>

<p>4. The king said,'A great saying! But I have an infirmity;-- I love
valour.'</p>

<p>5. I beg your Majesty,' was the reply, 'not to love small valour. 
If a man brandishes his sword, looks fiercely, and says, "How dare
he withstand me?"-- this is the valour of a common man, who can be the
opponent only of a single individual. I beg your Majesty to greaten it.</p>

<p>6. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
"The king blazed with anger,<br />
And he marshalled his hosts,<br />
To stop the march to Ch&uuml;,<br />
To consolidate the prosperity of Ch&acirc;u,<br />
To meet the expectations of the nation."
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">This was the valour of king Wan. King Wan, in one 
burst of his anger, gave repose to all the people of the kingdom.</p>

<p>7. 'In the Book of History it is said, "Heaven having produced the
inferior people, made for them rulers and teachers, with the purpose that
they should be assisting to God, and therefore distinguished them
throughout the four quarters of the land. Whoever are offenders, and
whoever are innocent, here am I to deal with them. How dare any under
heaven give indulgence to their refractory wills?" There was one man
pursuing a violent and disorderly course in the kingdom, and king W&ucirc;
was ashamed of it. This was the valour of king W&ucirc;. He also, by one
display of his anger, gave repose to all the people of the kingdom.</p>

<p>8. 'Let now your Majesty also, in one burst of anger, give repose to all
the people of the kingdom. The people are only afraid that your Majesty
does not love valour.'</p>



<p>1. The king Hs&uuml;an of Ch'&icirc; had an interview with Mencius in the
Snow palace, and said to him, 'Do men of talents and worth likewise find
pleasure in these things?' Mencius replied, 'They do; and if people
generally are not able to enjoy themselves, they condemn their 
superiors.</p>

<p>2. 'For them, when they cannot enjoy themselves, to condemn their
superiors is wrong, but when the superiors of the people do not make
enjoyment a thing common to the people and themselves, they also do
wrong.</p>

<p>3. 'When a ruler rejoices in the joy of his people, they also rejoice in
his joy; when he grieves at the sorrow of his people, they also grieve at
his sorrow. A sympathy of joy will pervade the kingdom ; a sympathy of
sorrow will do the same:-- in such a state of things, it cannot be but that
the ruler attain to the royal dignity.</p>

<p>4. 'Formerly, the duke Ching of Ch'&icirc; asked the minister Yen,
saying, "I wish to pay a visit of inspection to Chwan-f&ucirc;, and
Cb&acirc;o-w&ucirc;, and then to bend my course southward along the shore,
till I come to Lang-y&ecirc;. What shall I do that my tour may be fit to be
compared with the visits of inspection made by the ancient sovereigns?"</p>

<p>5. 'The minister Yen replied, "An excellent inquiry! When the Son of
Heaven visited the princes, it was called a tour of inspection, that is, be
surveyed the States under their care. When the princes attended at the
court of the Son of Heaven, it was called a report of office, that is, they
reported their administration of their offices. Thus, neither of the
proceedings was without a purpose. And moreover, in the spring they
examined the ploughing, and supplied any deficiency of seed; in the autumn
they examined the reaping, and supplied any deficiency of yield. There is
the saying of the Hsi&acirc; dynasty,-- If our king do not take his ramble,
what will become of our happiness? If our king do not make his excursion,
what will become of our help? That ramble, and that excursion, were a
pattern to the princes.</p>

<p>6. '"Now, the state of things is different.-- A host marches in
attendance on the ruler, and stores of provisions are consumed. The hungry
are deprived of their food, and there is no rest for those who are called
to toil. Maledictions are uttered by one to another with eyes askance, and
the people proceed to the commission of wickedness. Thus the royal
ordinances are violated, and the people are oppressed, and the supplies of
food and drink flow away like water. The rulers yield themselves to the
current, or they urge their way against it; they are wild; they are utterly
lost:-- these things proceed to the grief of the inferior princes.</p>

<p>7. '"Descending along with the current, and forgetting to return,
is what I call yielding to it. Pressing up against it, and forgetting to
return, is what I call urging their way against it. Pursuing the chase
without satiety is what I call being wild. Delighting in wine without
satiety is what I call being lost.</p>

<p>8. '"The ancient sovereigns had no pleasures to which they gave
themselves as on the flowing stream; no doings which might be so
characterized as wild and lost.</p>

<p>9. '"It is for you, my prince, to pursue your course."'</p>

<p>10. 'The duke Ching was pleased. He issued a proclamation throughout his
State, and went out and occupied a shed in the borders. From that time he
began to open his granaries to supply the wants of the people, and calling
the Grand music-master, he said to him-- "Make for me music to suit a
prince and his minister pleased with each other." And it was then that the
Ch&icirc;-sh&acirc;o and Chio-sh&acirc;o were made, in the words to which
it was said, "Is it a fault to restrain one's prince?" He who restrains his
prince loves his prince.'</p>



<p>1. The king Hs&uuml;an of Ch'&icirc; said, 'People all tell me to pull
down and remove the Hall of Distinction. Shall I pull it down, or stop the
movement for that object?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'The Hall of Distinction is a Hall appropriate to
the sovereigns. If your Majesty wishes to practise the true royal
government, then do not pull it down.'</p>

<p>3. The king said, 'May I hear from you what the true royal government
is?' 'Formerly,' was the reply, 'king Wan's government of Ch'&icirc; was as
follows:-- The husbandmen cultivated for the government one-ninth of the
land; the descendants of officers were salaried; at the passes and in the
markets, strangers were inspected, but goods were not taxed: there were no
prohibitions respecting the ponds and weirs; the wives and children of
criminals were not involved in their guilt. There were the old and
wifeless, or widowers; the old and husbandless, or widows; the old and
childless, or solitaries ; the young and fatherless, or orphans:-- these
four classes are the most destitute of the people, and have none to whom
they can tell their wants, and king Wan, in the institution of his
government with its benevolent action, made them the first objects of his
regard, as it is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
"The rich may get through life well;<br />
But alas! for the miserable and solitary!"'
</blockquote>

<p>4. The king said, 'O excellent words!' Mencius said, 'Since your Majesty
deems them excellent, why do you not practise them?' 'I have an infirmity,'
said the king; 'I am fond of wealth.' The reply was, 'Formerly,
Kung-l&icirc;u was fond of wealth. It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
"He reared his ricks, and filled his granaries,<br />
He tied up dried provisions and grain,<br />
In bottomless bags, and sacks,<br />
That he might gather his people together, and glorify his State.<br />
With bows and arrows all-displayed,<br />
With shields, and spears, and battle-axes, large and small,<br />
He commenced his march."
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">In this way those who remained in their old seat had
their ricks and granaries, and those who marched had their bags of
provisions. It was not till after this that he thought he could begin his
march. If your Majesty loves wealth, give the people power to gratify the
same feeling, and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal
sway?'</p>

<p>5. The king said, 'I have an infirmity; I am fond of beauty.' The reply
was, 'Formerly, king T'&acirc;i was fond of beauty, and loved his wife. It is
said in the Book of Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
K&ucirc;-kung T'an-f&ucirc;
Came in the morning, galloping his horse, 
By the banks of the western waters,
As far as the foot of Ch'&icirc; hill,
Along with the lady of Chiang;
They came and together chose the site for their settlement."
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">At that time, in the seclusion of the house, there were
no dissatisfied women, and abroad, there were no unmarried men. If your
Majesty loves beauty, let the people be able to gratify the same feeling,
and what difficulty will there be in your attaining the royal sway?'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said to the king Hs&uuml;an of Ch'&icirc;, 'Suppose that one
of your Majesty's ministers were to entrust his wife and children to the
care of his friend, while he himself went into Ch'&ucirc; to travel, and
that, on his return, he should find that the friend had let his wife and
children suffer from cold and hunger;-- how ought he to deal with him?' The
king said, 'He should cast him off.'</p>

<p>2. Mencius proceeded, 'Suppose that the chief criminal judge could not
regulate the officers under him, how would you deal with him?' The king
said, 'Dismiss him.'</p>

<p>3. Mencius again said, 'If within the four borders of your kingdom there
is not good government, what is to be done?' The king looked to the right
and left, and spoke of other matters.</p>
