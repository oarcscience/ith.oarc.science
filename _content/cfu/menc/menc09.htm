<CENTER><H1>Mencius Chapter 9</H1></CENTER>


<p>1. When the prince, afterwards duke Wan of T'ang, had to go to
Ch'&ucirc;, he went by way of Sung, and visited Mencius.</p>

<p>2. Mencius discoursed to him how the nature of man is good, and when
speaking, always made laudatory reference to Y&acirc;o and Shun.</p>

<p>3. When the prince was returning from Ch'&ucirc;, he again visited
Mencius. Mencius said to him, 'Prince, do you doubt my words? The path is
one, and only one.</p>

<p>4. 'Ch'ang Chi'en said to duke King of Ch'&icirc;, "They were men. I am
a man. Why should I stand in awe of them?" Yen Y&uuml;an said, "What kind
of man was Shun? What kind of man am I? He who exerts himself will also
become such as he was." Kung-Ming &Icirc; said, "King Wan is my teacher.
How should the duke of Ch&acirc;u deceive me by those words?"</p>

<p>5. 'Now, T'ang, taking its length with its breadth, will amount, I
suppose, to fifty l&icirc;. It is small, but still sufficient to make a
good State. It is said in the Book of History, "If medicine do not raise a
commotion in the patient, his disease will not be cured by it."'</p>



<p>1. When the duke Ting of T'ang died, the prince said to Yen Y&ucirc;,
'Formerly, Mencius spoke with me in Sung, and in my mind I have never
forgotten his words. Now, alas! this great duty to my father devolves upon
me; I wish to send you to ask the advice of Mencius, and then to proceed to
its various services'</p>

<p>2. Zan Y&ucirc; accordingly proceeded to Ts&acirc;u, and consulted
Mencius. Mencius said, 'Is this not good? In discharging the funeral duties
to parents, men indeed feel constrained to do their utmost. The philosopher
Tsang said, "When parents are alive, they should be served according to
propriety; when they are dead, they should be buried according to
propriety; and they should be sacrificed to according to propriety:-- this
may be called filial piety." The ceremonies to be observed by the princes I
have not learned, but I have heard these points:-- that the three years'
mourning, the garment of coarse cloth with its lower edge even, and the
eating of congee, were equally prescribed by the three dynasties, and
binding on all, from the sovereign to the mass of the people.'</p>

<p>3. Zan Y&ucirc; reported the execution of his commission, and the prince
determined that the three years' mourning should be observed. His aged
relatives, and the body of the officers, did not wish that it should be so,
and said, 'The former princes of L&ucirc;, that kingdom which we honour,
have, none of them, observed this practice, neither have any of our own
former princes observed it. For you to act contrary to their example is not
proper. Moreover, the History says,-- "In the observances of mourning and
sacrifice, ancestors are to be followed," meaning that they received those
things from a proper source to hand them down.'</p>

<p>4. The prince said again to Zan Y&ucirc;, 'Hitherto, I have not given
myself to the pursuit of learning, but have found my pleasure in
horsemanship and sword-exercise, and now I don't come up to the wishes of
my aged relatives and the officers. I am afraid I may not be able to
discharge my duty in the great business that I have entered on; do you
again consult Mencius for me.' On this, Zan Y&ucirc; went again to
Ts&acirc;u, and consulted Mencius. Mencius said, 'It is so, but he may not
seek a remedy in others, but only in himself. Confucius said, "When a
prince dies, his successor entrusts the administration to the prime
minister. He sips the congee. His face is of a deep black. He approaches
the place of mourning, and weeps. Of all the officers and inferior
ministers there is not one who will presume not to join in the lamentation,
he setting them this example. What the superior loves, his inferiors will
be found to love exceedingly. The relation between superiors and inferiors
is like that between the wind and grass. The grass must bend when the wind
blows upon it." The business depends on the prince.'</p>

<p>5. Zan Y&ucirc; returned with this answer to his commission, and the
prince said, 'It is so. The matter does indeed depend on me.' So for five
months he dwelt in the shed, without issuing an order or a caution. All the
officers and his relatives said, 'He may be said to understand the
ceremonies.' When the time of interment arrived, they came from all
quarters of the State to witness it. Those who had come from other States
to condole with him, were greatly pleased with the deep dejection of his
countenance and the mournfulness of his wailing and weeping.</p>



<p>1. The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius about the proper way of
governing a kingdom.</p>

<p>2. Mencius said, 'The business of the people may not be remissly attended
to. It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
"In the day-light go and gather the grass,<br />
And at night twist your ropes;<br />
Then get up quickly on the roofs;--<br />
Soon must we begin sowing again the grain."
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">3. 'The way of the people is this:-- If they have a
certain livelihood, they will have a fixed heart; if they have not a
certain livelihood, they have not a fixed heart. If they have not a fixed
heart, there is nothing which they will not do in the way of
self-abandonment, of moral deflection, of depravity, and of wild license.
When they have thus been involved in crime, to follow them up and punish
them:-- this is to entrap the people. How can such a thing as entrapping
the people be done under the rule of a benevolent man?</p>

<p>4. 'Therefore, a ruler who is endowed with talents and virtue will be
gravely complaisant and economical, showing a respectful politeness to his
ministers, and taking from the people only in accordance with regulated
limits.</p>

<p>5. 'Yang H&ucirc; said, "He who seeks to be rich will not be benevolent.
He who wishes to be benevolent will not be rich."</p>

<p>6. 'The sovereign of the Hsi&acirc; dynasty enacted the fifty m&acirc;u
allotment, and the payment of a tax. The founder of the Yin enacted the
seventy m&acirc;u allotment, and the system of mutual aid. The founder of
the Ch&acirc;u enacted the hundred m&acirc;u allotment, and the share
system. In reality, what was paid in all these was a tithe. The share
system means mutual division. The aid system means mutual dependence.</p>

<p>7. 'Lung said, "For regulating the lands, there is no better system than
that of mutual aid, and none which is not better than that of taxing. By
the tax system, the regular amount was fixed by taking the average of
several years. In good years, when the grain lies about in abundance, much
might be taken without its being oppressive, and the actual exaction would
be small. But in bad years, the produce being not sufficient to repay the
manuring of the fields, this system still requires the taking of the full
amount. When the parent of the people causes the people to wear looks of
distress, and, after the whole year's toil, yet not to be able to nourish
their parents, so that they proceed to borrowing to increase their means,
till the old people and children are found lying in the ditches and
water-channels:-- where, in such a case, is his parental relation to the
people?"</p>

<p>8. 'As to the system of hereditary salaries, that is already observed in
T'ang.</p>

<p>9. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
"May the rain come down on our public field,
And then upon our private fields!" 
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">It is only in the system of mutual aid that there is a
public field, and from this passage we perceive that even in the Ch&acirc;u
dynasty this system has been recognised.</p>

<p>10. 'Establish hsiang, hs&uuml;, hsio, and hsi&acirc;o,-- all those
educational institutions,-- for the instruction of the people. The name
hsiang indicates nourishing as its object; hsi&acirc;o, indicates teaching;
and hs&uuml; indicates archery. By the Hsi&acirc; dynasty the name
hsi&acirc;o was used; by the Yin, that of hs&uuml;; and by the Ch&acirc;u,
that of hsiang. As to the hsio, they belonged to the three dynasties, and
by that name. The object of them all is to illustrate the human relations.
When those are thus illustrated by superiors, kindly feeling will prevail
among the inferior people below.</p>

<p>11. 'Should a real sovereign arise, he will certainly come and take an
example from you; and thus you will be the teacher of the true
sovereign.</p>

<p>12. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
Although Ch&acirc;u. was an old country,<br />
It received a new destiny."
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">That is said with reference to king Wan. Do you
practise those things with vigour, and you also will by them make new your
kingdom.'</p>

<p>13. The duke afterwards sent P&icirc; Chan to consult Mencius about the
nine-squares system of dividing the land. Mencius said to him, 'Since your
prince, wishing to put in practice a benevolent government, has made choice
of you and put you into this employment, you must exert yourself to the
utmost. Now, the first thing towards a benevolent government must be to lay
down the boundaries. If the boundaries be not defined correctly, the
division of the land into squares will not be equal, and the produce
available for salaries will not be evenly distributed. On this account,
oppressive rulers and impure ministers are sure to neglect this defining of
the boundaries. When the boundaries have been defined correctly, the
division of the fields and the regulation of allowances may be determined
by you, sitting at your ease.</p>

<p>14. 'Although the territory of T'Ang is narrow and small, yet there must
be in it men of a superior grade, and there must be in it country-men. If
there were not men of a superior grade, there would be none to rule the
country-men. If there were not country-men, there would be none to support
the men of superior grade.</p>

<p>15. 'I would ask you, in the remoter districts, observing the
nine-squares division, to reserve one division to be cultivated on the
system of mutual aid, and in the more central parts of the kingdom, to make
the people pay for themselves a tenth part of their produce.</p>

<p>16. 'From the highest officers down to the lowest, each one must have
his holy field, consisting of fifty m&acirc;u.</p>

<p>17. 'Let the supernumerary males have their twenty-five m&acirc;u.</p>

<p>18. 'On occasions of death, or removal from one dwelling to another,
there will be no quitting the district. In the fields of a district, those
who belong to the same nine squares render all friendly offices to one
another in their going out and coming in, aid one another in keeping watch
and ward, and sustain one another in sickness. Thus the people are brought
to live in affection and harmony.</p>

<p>19. 'A square l&icirc; covers nine squares of land, which nine squares
contain nine hundred m&acirc;u. The central square is the public field, and
eight families, each having its private hundred m&acirc;u, cultivate in
common the public field. And not till the public work is finished, may they
presume to attend to their private affairs. This is the way by which the
country-men are distinguished from those of a superior grade.</p>

<p>20. 'Those are the great outlines of the system. Happily to modify and
adapt it depends on the prince and you.'</p>
