<p>1. There came from Ch'&ucirc; to T'ang one Hs&uuml; Hsing, who gave out
that he acted according to the words of Shan-nang. Coming right to his
gate, he addressed the duke Wan, saying, 'A man of a distant region, I have
heard that you, Prince, are practising a benevolent government, and I wish
to receive a site for a house, and to become one of your people.' The duke
Wan gave him a dwelling-place. His disciples, amounting to several tens,
all wore clothes of haircloth, and made sandals of hemp and wove mats for a
living.</p>

<p>2. At the same time, Ch'an Hsiang, a disciple of Ch'an Liang, and his
younger brother, Hsin, with their plough-handles and shares on their backs,
came from Sung to T'ang, saying, 'We have heard that you, Prince, are
putting into practice the government of the ancient sages, showing that you
are likewise a sage. We wish to become the subjects of a sage.'</p>

<p>3. When Ch'an Hsiang saw Hs&uuml; Hsing, he was greatly pleased with
him, and, abandoning entirely whatever he had learned, became his disciple.
Having an interview with Mencius, he related to him with approbation the
words of Hs&uuml; Hsing to the following effect:-- 'The prince of T'ang is
indeed a worthy prince. He has not yet heard, however, the real doctrines
of antiquity. Now, wise and able princes should cultivate the ground
equally and along with their people, and eat the fruit of their labour.
They should prepare their own meals, morning and evening, while at the same
time they carry on their government. But now, the prince of T'ang has his
granaries, treasuries, and arsenals, which is an oppressing of the people
to nourish himself. How can he be deemed a real worthy prince?'</p>

<p>4. Mencius said,'I suppose that Hs&uuml; Hsing sows grain and eats the
produce. Is it not so?' 'It is so,' was the answer. 'I suppose also he
weaves cloth, and wears his own manufacture. Is it not so?' 'No. Hs&uuml;
wears clothes of haircloth.' 'Does he wear a cap?' 'He wears a cap.' 'What
kind of cap?' 'A plain cap.' 'Is it woven by himself?' 'No. He gets it in
exchange for grain.' 'Why does Hs&uuml; not weave it himself?' 'That would
injure his husbandry.' 'Does Hs&uuml; cook his food in boilers and
earthenware pans, and does he plough with an iron share?' 'Yes.' 'Does he
make those articles himself?' 'No. He gets them in exchange for
grain.'</p>

<p>5. Mencius then said, 'The getting those various articles in exchange for
grain, is not oppressive to the potter and the founder, and the potter and
the founder in their turn, in exchanging their various articles for grain,
are not oppressive to the husbandman. How should such a thing be supposed?
And moreover, why does not Hs&uuml; act the potter and founder, supplying
himself with the articles which he uses solely from his own establishment?
Why does he go confusedly dealing and exchanging with the handicraftsmen?
Why does he not spare himself so much trouble?' Ch'an Hsiang replied, 'The
business of the handicraftsman can by no means be carried on along with the
business of husbandry.'</p>

<p>6. Mencius resumed, 'Then, is it the government of the kingdom which
alone can be carried on along with the practice of husbandry? Great men
have their proper business, and little men have their proper business.
Moreover, in the case of any single individual, whatever articles he can
require are ready to his hand, being produced by the various
handicraftsmen:-- if he must first make them for his own use, this way of
doing would keep all the people running about upon the roads. Hence, there
is the saying, "Some labour with their minds, and some labour with their
strength. Those who labour with their minds govern others; those who labour
with their strength are governed by others. Those who are governed by
others support them; those who govern others are supported by them." This
is a principle universally recognised.</p>

<p>7. 'In the time of Y&acirc;o, when the world had not yet been perfectly
reduced to order, the vast waters, flowing out of their channels, made a
universal inundation. Vegetation was luxuriant, and birds and beasts
swarmed. The various kinds of grain could not be grown. The birds and
beasts pressed upon men. The paths marked by the feet of beasts and prints
of birds crossed one another throughout the Middle Kingdom. To Y&acirc;o
alone this caused anxious sorrow. He raised Shun to office, and measures to
regulate the disorder were set forth. Shun committed to Y&icirc; the
direction of the fire to be employed, and Y&icirc; set fire to, and
consumed, the forests and vegetation on the mountains and in the marshes,
so that the birds and beasts fled away to hide themselves. Y&uuml;
separated the nine streams, cleared the courses of the Ts&icirc; and
T'&acirc;, and led them all to the sea. He opened a vent also for the
Z&ucirc; and Han, and regulated the course of the Hw&acirc;'i and Sze, so
that they all flowed into the Chiang. When this was done, it became
possible for the people of the Middle Kingdom to cultivate the ground and
get food for themselves. During that time, Y&uuml; was eight years away
from his home, and though he thrice passed the door of it, he did not
enter. Although he had wished to cultivate the ground, could he have done
so?'</p>

<p>8. 'The Minister of Agriculture taught the people to sow and reap,
cultivating the five kinds of grain. When the five kinds of grain were
brought to maturity, the people all obtained a subsistence. But men possess
a moral nature; and if they are well fed, warmly clad, and comfortably
lodged, without being taught at the same time, they become almost like the
beasts. This was a subject of anxious solicitude to the sage Shun, and he
appointed Hsieh to be the Minister of Instruction, to teach the relations
of humanity:-- how, between father and son, there should be affection;
between sovereign and minister, righteousness; between husband and wife,
attention to their separate functions; between old and young, a proper
order; and between friends, fidelity. The high meritorious sovereign said
to him, "Encourage them; lead them on; rectify them; straighten them; help
them; give them wings:-- thus causing them to become possessors of
themselves. Then follow this up by stimulating them, and conferring
benefits on them." When the sages were exercising their solicitude for the
people in this way, had they leisure to cultivate the ground?</p>

<p>9. 'What Y&acirc;o felt giving him anxiety was the not getting Shun.
What Shun felt giving him anxiety was the not getting Y&uuml; and K&acirc;o
Y&acirc;o. But he whose anxiety is about his hundred m&acirc;u not being
properly cultivated, is a mere husbandman.</p>

<p>10. 'The imparting by a man to others of his wealth, is called
"kindness." The teaching others what is good, is called "the exercise of
fidelity." The finding a man who shall benefit the kingdom, is called
"benevolence." Hence to give the throne to another man would be easy; to
find a man who shall benefit the kingdom is difficult.</p>

<p>11. 'Confucius said, "Great indeed was Y&acirc;o as a sovereign. It is
only Heaven that is great, and only Y&acirc;o corresponded to it. How vast
was his virtue! The people could find no name for it. Princely indeed was
Shun! How majestic was he, having possession of the kingdom, and yet
seeming as if it were nothing to him!" In their governing the kingdom, were
there no subjects on which Y&acirc;o and Shun employed their minds? There
were subjects, only they did not employ their minds on the cultivation of
the ground.</p>

<p>12. 'I have heard of men using the doctrines of our great land to change
barbarians, but I have never yet heard of any being changed by barbarians.
Ch'an Liang was a native of Ch'&ucirc;. Pleased with the doctrines of
Ch&acirc;u-kung and Chung-nE, he came northwards to the Middle Kingdom and
studied them. Among the scholars of the northern regions, there was perhaps
no one who excelled him. He was what you call a scholar of high and
distinguished qualities. You and your brother followed him some tens of
years, and when your master died, you forthwith turned away from him.</p>

<p>13. 'Formerly, when Confucius died, after three vears had elapsed, his
disciples collected their baggage, and prepared to return to their several
homes. But on entering to take their leave of Tsze-kung, as they looked
towards one another, they wailed, till they all lost their voices. After
this they returned to their homes, but Tsze-kung went back, and built a
house for himself on the altar-ground, where he lived alone other three
years, before he returned home. On another occasion, Tsze-hsi&acirc;,
Tsze-chang, and Tsze-y&ucirc;, thinking that Y&ucirc; Zo resembled the
sage, wished to render to him the same observances which they had rendered
to Confucius. They tried to force the disciple Tsang to join with them, but
he said, "This may not be done. What has been washed in the waters of the
Chiang and Han, and bleached in the autumn sun:-- how glistening is it!
Nothing can be added to it."</p>

<p>14. 'Now here is this shrike-tongued barbarian of the south, whose
doctrines are not those of the ancient kings. You turn away from your
master and become his disciple. Your conduct is different indeed from that
of the philosopher Tsang.</p>

<p>15. 'I have heard of birds leaving dark valleys to remove to lofty
trees, but I have not heard of their descending from lofty trees to enter
into dark valleys.</p>

<p>16. 'In the Praise-songs of L&ucirc; it is said,</p>

<blockquote>
"He smote the barbarians of the west and the north,<br />
He punished Ching and Sh&ucirc;."
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Thus Ch&acirc;u-kung would be sure to smite them, and
you become their disciple again; it appears that your change is not
good.'</p>

<p>17. Ch'an Hsiang said, 'If Hs&uuml;'s doctrines were followed, then
there would not be two prices in the market, nor any deceit in the
kingdom. If a boy of five cubits were sent to the market, no one would
impose on him; linen and silk of the same length would be of the same
price. So it would be with bundles of hemp and silk, being of the same
weight; with the different kinds of grain, being the same in quantity; and
with shoes which were of the same size.'</p>

<p>18. Mencius replied, 'It is the nature of things to be of unequal
quality. Some are twice, some five times, some ten times, some a hundred
times, some a thousand times, some ten thousand times as valuable as
others. If you reduce them all to the same standard, that must throw the
kingdom into confusion. If large shoes and small shoes were of the same
price, who would make them? For people to follow the doctrines of Hs&uuml;,
would be for them to lead one another on to practise deceit. How can they
avail for the government of a State?'</p>



<p>1. The Mohist, &Icirc; Chih, sought, through Hs&uuml; P&icirc;, to see
Mencius. Mencius said, 'I indeed wish to see him, but at present I am still
unwell. When I am better, I will myself go and see him. He need not come
here again.'</p>

<p>2. Next day, &Icirc; Chih again sought to see Mencius. Mencius said,
'To-day I am able to see him. But if I do not correct his errors, the true
principles will not be fully evident. Let me first correct him. I have
heard that this &Icirc; is a Mohist. Now Mo considers that in the
regulation of funeral matters a spare simplicity should be the rule.
&Icirc; thinks with Mo's doctrines to change the customs of the kingdom;--
how does he regard them as if they were wrong, and not honour them?
Notwithstanding his views, &Icirc; buried his parents in a sumptuous
manner, and so he served them in the way which his doctrines
discountenance.'</p>

<p>3. The disciple Hs&uuml; informed &Icirc; of these remarks. &Icirc;
said, 'Even according to the principles of the learned, we find that the
ancients acted towards the people "as if they were watching over an
infant." What does this expression mean? To me it sounds that we are to
love all without difference of degree; but the manifestation of love must
begin with our parents.' Hs&uuml; reported this reply to Mencius, who said,
'Now, does &Icirc; really think that a man's affection for the child of his
brother is merely like his affection for the infant of a neighbour? What is
to be approved in that expression is simply this:-- that if an infant
crawling about is likely to fall into a well, it is no crime in the infant.
Moreover, Heaven gives birth to creatures in such a way that they have one
root, and &Icirc; makes them to have two roots. This is the cause of his
error.</p>

<p>4. 'And, in the most ancient times, there were some who did not inter
their parents. When their parents died, they took them up and threw them
into some water-channel. Afterwards, when passing by them, they saw foxes
and wild-cats devouring them, and flies and gnats biting at them. The
perspiration started out upon their foreheads, and they looked away, unable
to bear the sight. It was not on account of other people that this
perspiration flowed. The emotions of their hearts affected their faces and
eyes, and instantly they went home, and came back with baskets and spades
and covered the bodies. If the covering them thus was indeed right, you may
see that the filial son and virtuous man, in interring in a handsome manner
their parents, act according to a proper rule.'</p>

<p>5. The disciple Hs&uuml; informed &Icirc; of what Mencius had said.
&Icirc; was thoughtful for a short time, and then said, 'He has instructed
me.'</p>
