<p>1. Mencius went to see king H&ucirc;i of Liang.</p>

<p>2. The king said, 'Venerable sir, since you have not counted it far to
come here, a distance of a thousand l&icirc;, may I presume that you are
provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?'</p>

<p>3. Mencius replied, 'Why must your Majesty use that word "profit?"  What
I am provided with, are counsels to benevolence and righteousness, and
these are my only topics.</p>

<p>4. 'If your Majesty say, "What is to be done to profit my kingdom?" the
great officers will say, "What is to be done to profit our families?" and
the inferior officers and the common people will say, "What is to be done
to profit our persons?"  Superiors and inferiors will try to snatch this
profit the one from the other, and the kingdom will be endangered.  In the
kingdom of ten thousand chariots, the murderer of his sovereign shall be
the chief of a family of a thousand chariots.  In the kingdom of a thousand
chariots, the murderer of his prince shall be the chief of a family of a
hundred chariots.  To have a thousand in ten thousand, and a hundred in a
thousand, cannot be said not to be a large allotment, but if righteousness
be put last, and profit be put first, they will not be satisfied without
snatching all.</p>

<p>5. 'There never has been a benevolent man who neglected his parents.
There never has been a righteous man who made his sovereign an after
consideration.</p>

<p>6. 'Let your Majesty also say, "Benevolence and righteousness, and let
these be your only themes."  Why must you use that word -- "profit?".</p>



<p>1. Mencius, another day, saw King H&ucirc;i of Liang.  The king went and
stood with him by a pond, and, looking round at the large geese and deer,
said, 'Do wise and good princes also find pleasure in these things?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'Being wise and good, they have pleasure in these
things.  If they are not wise and good, though they have these things, they
do not find pleasure.</p>

<p>3. 'It is said in the Book of Poetry,</p>
<blockquote>
He measured out and commenced his marvellous tower;<br />
He measured it out and planned it.<br />
The people addressed themselves to it,<br />
And in less than a day completed it.<br />
When he measured and began it, he said to them --<br />
<span class="tab">Be not so earnest:</span><br />
But the multitudes came as if they had been his children.<br />
The king was in his marvellous park;<br />
The does reposed about,<br />
The does so sleek and fat:<br />
And the white birds came glistening.<br />
The king was by his marvellous pond;<br />
How full was it of fishes leaping about!"
</blockquote>

<p>'King Wan used the strength of the people to make his tower and his
pond, and yet the people rejoiced to do the work, calling the tower "the
marvellous tower," calling the pond "the marvellous pond," and rejoicing
that he had his large deer, his fishes, and turtles.  The ancients caused
the people to have pleasure as well as themselves, and therefore they could
enjoy it.</p>

<p>4. 'In the Declaration of T'ang it is said, "O sun, when wilt thou
expire?  We will die together with thee." The people wished for Chieh's
death, though they should die with him.  Although he had towers, ponds,
birds, and animals, how could he have pleasure alone?'</p>



<p>1. King H&ucirc;i of Liang said, 'Small as my virtue is, in the
government of my kingdom, I do indeed exert my mind to the utmost.  If the
year be bad on the inside of the river, I remove as many of the people as I
can to the east of the river, and convey grain to the country in the
inside.  When the year is bad on the east of the river, I act on the same
plan.  On examining the government of the neighboring kingdoms, I do not
find that there is any prince who exerts his mind as I do.  And yet the
people of the neighboring kingdoms do not decrease, nor do my people
increase.  How is this?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'Your majesty is fond of war; -- let me take an
illustration from war. -- The soldiers move forward to the sound of the
drums; and after their weapons have been crossed, on one side they throw
away their coats of mail, trail their arms behind them, and run.  Some run
a hundred paces and stop; some run fifty paces and stop.  What would you
think if those who run fifty paces were to laugh at those who run a hundred
paces?' The kind said, 'They should not do so.  Though they did not run a
hundred paces, yet they also ran away.' 'Since your Majesty knows this,'
replied Mencius, 'you need not hope that your people will become more
numerous than those of the neighboring kingdoms.</p>

<p>3. 'If the seasons of husbandry be not interfered with, the grain will
be more than can be eaten.  If close nets are not allowed to enter the
pools and ponds, the fishes and turtles will be more than can be consumed.
If the axes and bills enter the hills and forests only at the proper time,
the wood will be more than can be used.  When the grain and fish and
turtles are more than can be eaten, and there is more wood than can be
used, this enables the people to nourish their living and mourn for their
dead, without any feeling against any.  This condition, in which the people
nourish their living and bury their dead without any feeling against any,
is the first step of royal government.</p>

<p>4. 'Let mulberry trees be planted about the homesteads with their five
m&acirc;u, and persons of fifty years may be clothed with silk.  In keeping
fowls, pigs, dogs, and swine, let not their times of breeding be neglected,
and persons of seventy years may eat flesh.  Let there not be taken away
the time that is proper for the cultivation of the farm with its hundred
m&acirc;, and the family of several mouths that is supported by it shall
not suffer from hunger.  Let careful attention be paid to education in
schools, inculcating in it especially the filial and fraternal duties, and
grey-haired men will not be seen upon the roads, carrying burdens on their
backs or on their heads.  It never has been that the ruler of a State,
where such results were seen, -- persons of seventy wearing silk and eating
flesh, and the black-haired people suffering neither from hunder nor cold,
-- did not attain to the royal dignity.</p>

<p>5. 'Your dogs and swine eat the food of men, and you do not make any
restrictive arrangements.  There are people dying from famine on the roads,
and you do not issue the stores of your granaries for them.  When people
die, you say, "It is not owing to me; it is owing to the year." In what
does this differ from stabbing a man and killing him, and then saying --
"It was not I; it was the weapon?"  Let your Majesty cease to lay the blame
on the year, and instantly from all the nation the people will come to
you.'</p>



<p>1. King H&ucirc;i of Liang said, 'I wish quietly to receive your
instructions.'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'Is there any difference between killing a man with a
stick and with a sword ?'  The king said, 'There is no difference!</p>

<p>3. 'Is there any difference between doing it with a sword and with the
style of government? 'There is no difference,' was the reply.</p>

<p>4. Mencius then said, 'In your kitchen there is fat meat; in your
stables there are fat horses. But your people have the look of
hunger, and on the wilds there are those who have died of famine.
This is leading on beasts to devour men.</p>

<p>5. 'Beasts devour one another, and men hate them for doing so. When a
prince, being the parent of his people, administers his government so as
to be chargeable with leading on beasts to devour men, where is his
parental relation to the people?'</p>

<p>6. Chung-n&icirc; said, 'Was he not without posterity who first made wooden
images to bury with the dead? So he said, because that man made the
semblances of men, and used them for that purpose:-- what shall be thought
of him who causes his people to die of hunger?'</p>



<p>1. King H&ucirc;i of Liang said, 'There was not in the nation a stronger
State than Tsin, as you, venerable Sir, know. But since it descended to me,
on the east we have been defeated by Ch'i, and then my eldest son perished;
on the west we have lost seven hundred l&icirc; of territory to  Ch'in; and
on the south we have sustained disgrace at the hands of Ch'&ucirc;. I have
brought shame on my departed predecessors, and wish on their account to
wipe it away, once for all. What course is to be pursued to accomplish
this?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'With a territory which is only a hundred l&icirc; 
square, it is possible to attain to the royal dignity.</p>

<p>3. 'If Your Majesty will indeed dispense a benevolent government to the
people, being sparing in the use of punishments and fines, and making the
taxes and levies light, so causing that the fields shall be ploughed deep,
and the weeding of them be carefully attended to, and that the
strong-bodied, during their days of leisure, shall cultivate their filial
piety, fraternal respectfulness, sincerity, and truthfulness, serving
thereby, at home, their fathers and elder brothers, and, abroad, their
elders and superiors,-- you will then have a people who can be employed,
with sticks which they have prepared, to oppose the strong mail and sharp
weapons of the troops of Ch'in and Ch'&ucirc;.</p>

<p>4. 'The rulers of those States rob their people of their time, so that they
cannot plough and weed their fields, in order to support their parents.
Their parents suffer from cold and hunger. Brothers, wives, and children
are separated and scattered abroad.</p>

<p>5. 'Those rulers, as it were, drive their people into pit-falls, or drown
them.  Your Majesty will go to punish them. In such a case, who will oppose
your Majesty?</p>

<p>6. 'In accordance with this is the saying,-- "The benevolent has
no enemy."  I beg your Majesty not to doubt what I say.'</p>
