<p>1. Mencius said, 'Confucius ascended the eastern hill, and L&ucirc;
appeared to him small. He ascended the T'&acirc;i mountain, and all beneath
the heavens appeared to him small. So he who has contemplated the sea,
finds it difficult to think anything of other waters, and he who has
wandered in the gate of the sage, finds it difficult to think anything of
the words of others.</p>

<p>2. 'There is an art in the contemplation of water.-- It is necessary to
look at it as foaming in waves. The sun and moon being possessed of
brilliancy, their light admitted even through an orifice illuminates.</p>

<p>3. 'Flowing water is a thing which does not proceed till it has filled
the hollows in its course. The student who has set his mind on the
doctrines of the sage, does not advance to them but by completing one
lesson after another.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'He who rises at cock-crowing and addresses himself
earnestly to the practice of virtue, is a disciple of Shun.</p>

<p>2. 'He who rises at cock-crowing, and addresses himself earnestly to the
pursuit of giin, is a disciple of Chih.</p>

<p>3. 'If you want to know what separates Shun from Chih, it is simply
this,-- the interval between the thought of gain and the thought of
virtue.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'The principle of the philosopher Yang was-- "Each one
for himself." Though he might have benefited the whole kingdom by plucking
out a single hair, he would not have done it.</p>

<p>2. 'The philosopher Mo loves all equally. If by rubbing smooth his whole
body from the crown to the heel, he could have benefited the kingdom, he
would have done it.</p>

<p>3. 'Tsze-mo holds a medium between these. By holding that medium, he is
nearer the right. But by holding it without leaving room for the exigency
of circumstances, it becomes like their holding their one point.</p>

<p>4. 'The reason why I hate that holding to one point is the injury it
does to the way of right principle. It takes up one point and disregards a
hundred others.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'The hungry think any food sweet, and the thirsty think
the same of any drink, and thus they do not get the right taste of what
they eat and drink. The hunger and thirst, in fact, injure their palate.
And is it only the mouth and belly which are injured by hunger and thirst?
Men's minds are also injured by them.</p>

<p>2. 'If a man can prevent the evils of hunger and thirst from being any
evils to his mind, he need not have any sorrow about not being equal to
other men.'</p>





<p>Mencius said, 'A man with definite aims to be accomplished may be
compared to one digging a well. To dig the well to a depth of seventy-two
cubits, and stop without reaching the spring, is after all throwing away
the well.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'Benevolence and righteousness were natural to
Y&acirc;o and Shun. T'ang and W&ucirc; made them their own. The five chiefs
of the princes feigned them.</p>

<p>2. 'Having borrowed them long and not returned them, how could it be
known they did not own them?'</p>



<p>1. Kung-sun Ch'&acirc;u said, '&Icirc; Yin said, "I cannot be near and
see him so disobedient to reason," and therewith he banished
T'&acirc;-chi&acirc; to T'ung. The people were much pleased. When
T'&acirc;-chi&acirc; became virtuous, he brought him back, and the people
were again much pleased.</p>

<p>2. 'When worthies are ministers, may they indeed banish their sovereigns
in this way when they are not virtuous?'</p>

<p>3. Mencius replied, 'If they have the same purpose as &Icirc; Yin, they
may. If they have not the same purpose, it would be usurpation.'</p>



<p>Kung-sun Ch'&acirc;u said, 'It is said, in the Book of Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
"He will not eat the bread of idleness!"
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">How is it that we see superior men eating without
labouring?' Mencius replied, 'When a superior man resides in a country, if
its sovereign employ his counsels, he comes to tranquillity, wealth and
glory. If the young in it follow his instructions, they become filial,
obedient to their elders, true-hearted, and faithful. What greater example
can there be than this of not eating the bread of idleness?'</p>



<p>1. The king's son, Tien, asked Mencius, saying, 'What is the business of
the unemployed scholar?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'To exalt his aim.'</p>

<p>3. Tien asked again, 'What do you mean by exalting the aim?' The answer
was, 'Setting it simply on benevolence and righteousness. He thinks how to
put a single innocent person to death is contrary to benevolence; how to
take what one has not a right to is contrary to righteousness; that one's
dwelling should be benevolence; and one's path should be righteousness.
Where else should he dwell? What other path should he pursue? When
benevolence is the dwelling-place of the heart, and righteousness the path
of the life, the business of a great man is complete.'</p>



<p>Mencius said, 'Supposing that the kingdom of Ch'&icirc; were offered,
contrary to righteousness, to Ch'an Chung, he would not receive it, and all
people believe in him, as a man of the highest worth. But this is only the
righteousness which declines a dish of rice or a plate of soup. A man can
have no greater crimes than to disown his parents and relatives, and the
relations of sovereign and minister, superiors and inferiors. How can it be
allowed to give a man credit for the great excellences because he possesses
a small one?'</p>



<p>1. T'&acirc;o Ying asked, saying, 'Shun being sovereign, and
K&acirc;o-y&acirc;o chief minister of justice, if K&ucirc;-s&acirc;u had
murdered a man, what would have been done in the case?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius said, 'K&acirc;o-y&acirc;o would simply have apprehended
him.'</p>

<p>3. 'But would not Shun have forbidden such a thing?'</p>

<p>4. 'Indeed, how could Shun have forbidden it? K&acirc;o-y&acirc;o had
received the law from a proper source.'</p>

<p>5. 'In that case what would Shun have done?'</p>

<p>6. 'Shun would have regarded abandoning the kingdom as throwing away a
worn-out sandal. He would privately have taken his father on his back, and
retired into concealment, living some where along the sea-coast. There he
would have been all his life, cheerful and happy, forgetting the
kingdom.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius, going from Fan to Ch'&icirc;, saw the king of Ch'&icirc;'s
son at a distance, and said with a deep sigh, 'One's position alters the
air, just as the nurture affects the body. Great is the influence of
position! Are we not all men's sons in this respect?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius said, 'The residence, the carriages and horses, and the dress
of the king's son, are mostly the same as those of other men. That he looks
so is occasioned by his position. How much more should a peculiar air
distinguish him whose position is in the wide house of the world!</p>

<p>3. 'When the prince of L&ucirc; went to Sung, he called out at the
T'ieh-ch&acirc;i gate, and the keeper said, "This is not our prince. How is
it that his voice is so like that of our prince?" This was occasioned by
nothing but the correspondence of their positions.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'To feed a scholar and not love him, is to treat him as
a pig. To love him and not respect him, is to keep him as a domestic
animal.</p>

<p>2. 'Honouring and respecting are what exist before any offering of
gifts.</p>

<p>3. 'If there be honouring and respecting without the reality of them, a
superior man may not be retained by such empty demonstrations.'</p>



<p>Mencius said, 'The bodily organs with their functions belong to our
Heaven-conferred nature. But a man must be a sage before he can satisfy the
design of his bodily organization.'</p>



<p>1. The king Hs&uuml;an of Ch'&icirc; wanted to shorten the period of
mourning. Kung-sun Ch'&acirc;u said, 'To have one whole year's mourning is
better than doing away with it altogether.'</p>

<p>2. Mencius said, 'That is just as if there were one twisting the arm of
his elder brother, and you were merely to say to him "Gently, gently, if
you please." Your only course should be to teach such an one filial piety
and fraternal duty.'</p>

<p>3. At that time, the mother of one of the king's sons had died, and his
tutor asked for him that he might be allowed to observe a few months'
mourning. Kung-sun Ch'&acirc;u asked, 'What do you say of this?'</p>

<p>4. Mencius replied, 'This is a case where the party wishes to complete
the whole period, but finds it impossible to do so. The addition of even a
single day is better than not mourning at all. I spoke of the case where
there was no hindrance, and the party neglected the thing itself.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'There are five ways in which the superior man effects
his teaching.</p>

<p>2. 'There are some on whom his influence descends like seasonable
rain.</p>

<p>3. 'There are some whose virtue he perfects, and some of whose talents
he assists the development.</p>

<p>4. 'There are some whose inquiries he answers.</p>

<p>5. 'There are some who privately cultivate and correct themselves.</p>

<p>6. These five ways are the methods in which the superior man effects his
teaching.'</p>



<p>1. Kung-sun Ch'&acirc;u said, 'Lofty are your principles and admirable,
but to learn them may well be likened to ascending the heavens,-- something
which cannot be reached. Why not adapt your teaching so as to cause
learners to consider them attainable, and so daily exert themselves!'</p>

<p>2. Mencius said, 'A great artificer does not, for the sake of a stupid
workman, alter or do away with the marking-line. &Icirc; did not, for the
sake of a stupid archer, charge his rule for drawing the bow.</p>

<p>3. 'The superior man draws the bow, but does not discharge the arrow,
having seemed to leap with it to the mark; and he there stands exactly in
the middle of the path. Those who are able, follow him.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'When right principles prevail throughout the kingdom,
one's principles must appear along with one's person. When right principles
disappear from the kingdom, one's person must vanish along with one's
principles.</p>

<p>2. 'I have not heard of one's principles being dependent for their
manifestation on other men.'</p>



<p>1. The disciple Kung-t&ucirc; said, 'When Kang of T'ang made his
appearance in your school, it seemed proper that a polite consideration
should be paid to him, and yet you did not answer him. Why was that?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'I do not answer him who questions me presuming on
his nobility, nor him who presumes on his talents, nor him who presumes on
his age, nor him who presumes on services performed to me, nor him who
presumes on old acquaintance. Two of those things were chargeable on Kang
of T'ang.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'He who stops short where stopping is acknowledged to
be not allowable, will stop short in everything. He who behaves shabbily to
those whom he ought to treat well, will behave shabbily to all.</p>

<p>2. 'He who advances with precipitation will retire with speed.'</p>



<p>Mencius said, 'In regard to inferior creatures, the superior man is kind
to them, but not loving. In regard to people generally, he is loving to
them, but not affectionate. He is affectionate to his parents, and lovingly
disposed to people generally. He is lovingly disposed to people generally,
and kind to creatures.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'The wise embrace all knowledge, but they are most
earnest about what is of the greatest importance. The benevolent embrace
all in their love, but what they consider of the greatest importance is to
cultivate an earnest affection for the virtuous. Even the wisdom of
Y&acirc;o and Shun did not extend to everything, but they attended
earnestly to what was important. Their benevolence did not show itself in
acts of kindness to every man, but they earnestly cultivated an affection
for the virtuous.</p>

<p>2. 'Not to be able to keep the three years' mourning, and to be very
particular about that of three months, or that of five months; to eat
immoderately and swill down the soup, and at the same time to inquire about
the precept not to tear the meat with the teeth;-- such things show what I
call an ignorance of what is most important.</p>
