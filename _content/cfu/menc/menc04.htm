<p>1. Mencius, having an interview with the king Hs&uuml;an of Ch'&icirc;, 
said to him, 'When men speak of "an ancient kingdom," it is not meant thereby
that it has lofty trees in it, but that it has ministers sprung from
families which have been noted in it for generations. Your Majesty has no
intimate ministers even. Those whom you advanced yesterday are gone to-day,
and you do not know it.'</p>

<p>2. The king said, 'How shall I know that they have not ability, and so
avoid employing them at all?'</p>

<p>3. The reply was, 'The ruler of a State advances to office men of talents
and virtue only as a matter of necessity. Since he will thereby cause the
low to overstep the honourable, and distant to overstep his near relatives,
ought he to do so but with caution?</p>

<p>4. 'When all those about you say,-- "This is a man of talents and
worth," you may not therefore believe it. When your great officers all
say,-- "This is a man of talents and virtue," neither may you for that
believe it. When all the people say,-- "This is a man of talents and
virtue," then examine into the case, and when you find that the man is
such, employ him. When all those about you say,-- "This man won't do,"
don't listen to them. When all your great officers say,-- "This man won't
do," don't listen to them. When the people all sav,-- "This man won't do,"
then examine into the case, and when you find that the man won't do, send
him away.</p>

<p>5. 'When all those about you say,-- "This man deserves death," don't
listen to them. When all your great officers say,-- "This man deserves
death," don't listen to them. When the people all say,"This man deserves
death," then inquire into the case, and when you see that the man deserves
death, put him to death. In accordance with this we have the saying, "The
people killed him."</p>

<p>6. 'You must act in this way in order to be the parent of the
people.'</p>



<p>1. The king Hs&uuml;an of Ch'&icirc; asked, saying, 'Was it so,
that T'ang banished Chieh, and that king W&ucirc; smote Ch&acirc;u?' 
Mencius replied, 'It is so in the records.'</p>

<p>2. The king said, 'May a minister then put his sovereign to death?'</p>

<p>3. Mencius said, 'He who outrages the benevolence proper to his nature,
is called a robber; he who outrages righteousness, is called a ruffian. The
robber and ruffian we call a mere fellow. I have heard of the cutting off
of the fellow Ch&acirc;u, but I have not heard of the putting a sovereign
to death, in his case.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius, having an interview with the king Hs&uuml;an of Ch'&icirc;,
said to him, 'If you are going to build a large mansion, you will surely
cause the Master of the workmen to look out for large trees, and when he
has found such large trees, you will be glad, thinking that they will
answer for the intended object. Should the workmen hew them so as to make
them too small, then your Majesty will be angry, thinking that they will
not answer for the purpose. Now, a man spends his youth in learning the
principles of right government, and, being grown up to vigour, he wishes to
put them in practice;-- if your Majesty says to him, "For the present put
aside what you have learned, and follow me," what shall we say?</p>

<p>2. 'Here now you have a gem unwrought, in the stone. Although it may be
worth 240,000 taels, you will surely employ a lapidary to cut and polish
it. But when you come to the government of the State, then you say,-- "For
the present put aside what you have learned, and follow me." How is it that
you herein act so differently from your conduct in calling in the lapidary
to cut the gem?'</p>



<p>1. The people of Ch'&icirc; attacked Yen, and conquered it.</p>

<p>2. The king Hs&uuml;an asked, saying, 'Some tell me not to take
possession of it for myself, and some tell me to take possession of it. For
a kingdom of ten thousand chariots, attacking another of ten thousand
chariots, to complete the conquest of it in fifty days, is an achievement
beyond mere human strength. If I do not take possession of it, calamities
from Heaven will surely come upon me. What do you say to my taking
possession of it?'</p>

<p>3. Mencius replied, 'If the people of Yen will be pleased with your taking
possession of it, then do so.-- Among the ancients there was one who acted on
this principle, namely king W&ucirc;. If the people of Yen will not be pleased
with your taking possession of it, then do not do so.-- Among the ancients
there was one who acted on this principle, namely king Wan.</p>

<p>4. 'When, with all the strength of your country of ten thousand
chariots, you attacked another country of ten thousand chariots, and the
people brought baskets of rice and vessels of congee, to meet your
Majesty's host, was there any other reason for this but that they hoped to
escape out of fire and water ? If you make the water more deep and the fire
more fierce, they will in like manner make another revolution.'</p>



<p>1. The people of Ch'&icirc;, having smitten Yen, took possession of it,
and upon this, the princes of the various States deliberated together, and
resolved to deliver Yen from their power. The king Hs&uuml;an said to
Mencius, 'The princes have formed many plans to attack me:-- how shall I
prepare myself for them?' Mencius replied, 'I have heard of one who with
seventy l&icirc; exercised all the functions of government throughout the
kingdom. That was T'ang. I have never heard of a prince with a thousand
l&icirc; standing in fear of others.'</p>

<p>2. 'It is said in the Book of History, As soon as T'ang began his work
of executing justice, he commenced with Ko. The whole kingdom had
confidence in him. When he pursued his work in the east, the rude tribes on
the west murmured. So did those on the north, when he was engaged in the
south. Their cry was-- "Why does he put us last?" Thus, the people looked
to him, as we look in a time of great drought to the clouds and rainbows.
The frequenters of the markets stopped not. The husbandmen made no change
in their operations. While he punished their rulers, he consoled the
people. His progress was like the falling of opportune rain, and the people
were delighted. It is said again in the Book of History, "We have waited
for our prince long; the prince's coming will be our reviving!"</p>

<p>3. 'Now the ruler of Yen was tyrannizing over his people, and your
Majesty went and punished him. The people supposed that you were going to
deliver them out of the water and the fire, and brought baskets of rice and
vessels of congee, to meet your Majesty's host. But you have slain their
fathers and elder brothers, and put their sons and younger brothers in
confinement. You have pulled down the ancestral temple of the State, and
are removing to Ch'&icirc; its precious vessels. How can such a course be
deemed proper? The rest of the kingdom is indeed jealously afraid of the
strength of Ch'&icirc;; and now, when with a doubled territory you do not
put in practice a benevolent government;-- it is this which sets the arms
of the kingdom in in motion.</p>

<p>4. 'If your Majesty will make haste to issue an ordinance, restoring
your captives, old and young, stopping the removal of the precious vessels,
and saying that, after consulting with the people of Yen, you will appoint
them a ruler, and withdraw from the country;-- in this way you may still be
able to stop the threatened attack.'</p>



<p>1. There had been a brush between Ts&acirc;u and L&ucirc;, when the duke
M&ucirc; asked Mencius, saying,'Of my officers there were killed
thirty-three men, and none of the people would die in their defence. Though
I sentenced them to death for their conduct, it is impossible to put such a
multitude to death. If I do not put them to death, then there is the crime
unpunished of their looking angrily on at the death of their officers, and
not saving them. How is the exigency of the case to be met?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'In calamitous years and years of famine, the old
and weak of your people, who have been found lying in the ditches and
water-channels, and the able-bodied who have been scattered about to the
four quarters, have amounted to several thousands. All the while, your
granaries, 0 prince, have been stored with grain, and your treasuries and
arsenals have been full, and not one of your officers has told you of the
distress. Thus negligent have the superiors in your State been, and cruel
to their inferiors. The philosopher Tsang said, "Beware, beware. What
proceeds from you, will return to you again." Now at length the people have
paid back the conduct of their officers to them. Do not you, 0 prince,
blame them.</p>

<p>3. 'If you will put in practice a benevolent government, this people
will love you and all above them, and will die for their officers.'</p>



<p>1. The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius, saying, 'T'ang is a small 
kingdom, and lies between Ch'&icirc; and Ch'&ucirc;. Shall I serve
Ch'&icirc;? Or shall I serve Ch&ucirc;?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'This plan which you propose is beyond me. If you will
have me counsel you, there is one thing I can suggest. Dig deeper your
moats; build higher your walls; guard them as well as your people. In case
of attack, be prepared to die in your defence, and have the people so that
they will not leave you;-- this is a proper course.</p>



<p>1. The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius, saying, 'The people of
Ch'&icirc; are going to fortify Hsieh. The movement occasions me great 
alarm. What is the proper course for me to take in the case?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'Formerly, when king T'&acirc;i dwelt in Pin, the
barbarians of the north were continually making incursions upon it. He
therefore left it, went to the foot of mount Ch'&icirc;, and there took up
his residence. He did not take that situation, as having selected it. It
was a matter of necessity with him.</p>

<p>3. 'If you do good, among your descendants, in after generations, there
shall be one who will attain to the royal dignity. A prince lays the
foundation of the inheritance, and hands down the beginning which he has
made, doing what may be continued by his successors. As to the
accomplishment of the great result, that is with Heaven. What is that
Ch'&icirc; to you, 0 prince? Be strong to do good. That is all your
business.'</p>



<p>1. The duke Wan of T'ang asked Mencius, saying, 'T'ang is a small State.
Though I do my utmost to serve those large kingdoms on either side of it,
we cannot escape suffering from them. What course shall I take that we may
do so?' Mencius replied, 'Formerly, when king T'&acirc;i dwelt in Pin, the
barbarians of the north were constantly making incursions upon it. He
served them with skins and silks, and still he suffered from them. He
served them with dogs and horses, and still he suffered from them. He
served them with pearls and gems, and still he suffered from them. Seeing
this, he assembled the old men, and announced to them, saying, "What the
barbarians want is my territory. I have heard this,-- that a ruler does not
injure his people with that wherewith he nourishes them. My children, why
should you be troubled about having no prince? I will leave this."
Accordingly, he left Pin, crossed the mountain Liang, built a town at the
foot of mount Ch'&icirc;, and dwelt there. The people of Pin said, "He is a
benevolent man. We must not lose him." Those who followed him looked like
crowds hastening to market.</p>

<p>2. 'On the other hand, some say, "The kingdom is a thing to be kept
from generation to generation. One individual cannot undertake to dispose
of it in his own person. Let him be prepared to die for it. Let him not
quit it."</p>

<p>3. 'I ask you, prince, to make your election between these two
courses.'</p>



<p>1. The duke P'ing of L&ucirc; was about to leave his palace, when his
favourite, one Tsang Ts'ang, made a request to him, saying, 'On other days,
when you have gone out, you have given instructions to the officers as to
where you were going.  But now, the horses have been put to the carriage,
and the officers do not yet know where you are going. I venture to ask.'
The duke said, 'I am going to see the scholar Mang.' ' How is this?' said
the other. 'That you demean yourself, prince, in paying the honour of the
first visit to a common man, is, I suppose, because you think that he is a
man of talents and virtue. By such men the rules of ceremonial proprieties
and right are observed. But on the occasion of this Mang's second mourning,
his observances exceeded those of the former. Do not go to see him, my
prince.' The duke said, 'I will not.'</p>

<p>2. The officer Yo-chang entered the court, and had an audience. He said,
'Prince, why have you not gone to see Mang K'o?' the duke said, 'One told
me that, on the occasion of the scholar Mang's second mourning, his
observances exceeded those of the former. It is on that account that I have
not gone to see him.' 'How is this!' answered Yo-chang. 'By what you call
"exceeding," you mean, I suppose, that, on the first occasion, he used the
rites appropriate to a scholar, and, on the second, those appropriate to a
great officer; that he first used three tripods, and afterwards five
tripods.' The duke said, 'No; I refer to the greater excellence of the
coffin, the shell, the grave-clothes, and the shroud.' Yo-chAng said, 'That
cannot be called "exceeding." That was the difference between being poor
and being rich.'</p>

<p>3. After this, Yo-chang saw Mencius, and said to him, 'I told the prince
about you, and he was consequently coming to see you, when one of his
favourites, named Tsang Ts'ang, stopped him, and therefore he did not come
according to his purpose.' Mencius said, 'A man's advancement is effected,
it may be, by others, and the stopping him is, it may be, from the efforts
of others. But to advance a man or to stop his advance is really beyond the
power of other men. My not finding in the prince of L&ucirc; a ruler who
would confide in me, and put my counsels into practice, is from Heaven. How
could that scion of the Tsang family cause me not to find the ruler that
would suit me?'</p>
