<p>1. Ch'an T&acirc;i said to Mencius, 'In not going to wait upon any of
the princes, you seem to me to be standing on a small point. If now you
were once to wait upon them, the result might be so great that you would
make one of them sovereign, or, if smaller, that you would make one of them
chief of all the other princes. Moreover, the History says, "By bending
only one cubit, you make eight cubits straight." It appears to me like a
thing which might be done.'</p>

<p>2. Mencius said, 'Formerly, the duke Ching of Ch'&icirc;, once when he
was hunting, called his forester to him by a flag. The forester would not
come, and the duke was going to kill him. With reference to this incident,
Confucius said, "The determined officer never forgets that his end may be
in a ditch or a stream; the brave officer never forgets that he may lose
his head." What was it in the forester that Confucius thus approved? He
approved his not going to the duke, when summoned by the article which was
not appropriate to him. If one go to see the princes without waiting to be
invited, what can be thought of him?</p>

<p>3. 'Moreover, that sentence, "By bending only one cubit, you make
eight cubits straight," is spoken with reference to the gain that may be
got. If gain be the object, then, if it can be got by bending eight cubits
to make one cubit straight, may we likewise do that?</p>

<p>4. 'Formerly, the officer Ch&acirc;o Chien made Wang Liang act as
charioteer for his favourite Hs&icirc;, when, in the course of a whole day,
they did not get a single bird. The favourite Hs&icirc; reported this
result, saying, "He is the poorest charioteer in the world." Some one told
this to Wang Liang, who said, "I beg leave to try again." By dint of
pressing, this was accorded to him, when in one morning they got ten birds.
The favourite, reporting this result, said, "He is the best charioteer in
the world." Chien said, "I will make him always drive your chariot for
you." When he told Wang Liang so, however, Liang refused, saying, "I drove
for him, strictly observing the proper rules for driving, and in the whole
day he did not get one bird. I drove for him so as deceitfully to intercept
the birds, and in one morning he got ten. It is said in the Book of
Poetry,</p>

<blockquote>
'There is no failure in the management of their horses;<br />
The arrows are discharged surely, like the blows of an axe.'
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">I am not accustomed to drive for a mean man. I beg
leave to decline the office."</p>

<p>5. 'Thus this charioteer even was ashamed to bend improperly to the will
of such an archer. Though, by bending to it, they would have caught birds
and animals sufficient to form a hill, he would not do so. If I were to
bend my principles and follow those princes, of what kind would my conduct
be? And you are wrong. Never has a man who has bent himself been able to
make others straight.'</p>



<p>2. Mencius said, 'How can such men be great men? Have you not read the
Ritual Usages?-- "At the capping of a young man, his father admonishes him.
At the marrying away of a young woman, her mother admonishes her,
accompanying her to the door on her leaving, and cautioning her with these
words, 'You are going to your home. You must be respectful; you must be
careful. Do not disobey your husband.'" Thus, to look upon compliance as
their correct course is the rule for women.</p>

<p>3. 'To dwell in the wide house of the world, to stand in the correct
seat of the world, and to walk in the great path of the world; when he
obtains his desire for office, to practise his principles for the good of
the people; and when that desire is disappointed, to practise them alone;
to be above the power of riches and honours to make dissipated, of poverty
and mean condition to make swerve from principle, and of power and force to
make bend:-- these characteristics constitute the great man.'</p>



<p>1. Ch&acirc;u Hsi&acirc;o asked Mencius, saying, 'Did superior men of
old time take office?' Mencius replied, 'They did. The Record says, "If
Confucius was three months without being employed by some ruler, he looked
anxious and unhappy. When he passed from the boundary of a State, he was
sure to carry with him his proper gift of introduction." Kung-ming &Icirc;
said, "Among the ancients, if an officer was three months unemployed by a
ruler, he was condoled with."'</p>

<p>2. Hsi&acirc;o said, 'Did not this condoling, on being three months
unemployed by a ruler, show a too great urgency?'</p>

<p>3. Mencius answered, 'The loss of his place to an officer is like the
loss of his State to a prince. It is said in the Book of Rites, "A prince
ploughs himself, and is assisted by the people, to supply the millet for
sacrifice. His wife keeps silkworms, and unwinds their cocoons, to make the
garments for sacrifice." If the victims be not perfect, the millet not
pure, and the dress not complete, he does not presume to sacrifice. "And
the scholar who, out of office, has no holy field, in the same way, does
not sacrifice. The victims for slaughter, the vessels, and the garments,
not being all complete, he does not presume to sacrifice, and then neither
may he dare to feel happy." Is there not here sufficient ground also for
condolence?'</p>

<p>4. Hsi&acirc;o again asked, 'What was the meaning of Confucius's always
carrying his proper gift of introduction with him, when he passed over the
boundaries of the State where he had been?'</p>

<p>5. 'An officer's being in office,' was the reply, 'is like the ploughing
of a husbandman. Does a husbandman part with his plough, because he goes
from one State to another?'</p>

<p>6. Hsi&acirc;o pursued, 'The kingdom of Tsin is one, as well as others,
of official employments, but I have not heard of anyone being thus earnest
about being in office. If there should be this urge why does a superior man
make any difficulty about taking it?' Mencius answered, 'When a son is
born, what is desired for him is that he may have a wife; when a daughter
is born, what is desired for her is that she may have a husband. This
feeling of the parents is possessed by all men. If the young people,
without waiting for the orders of their parents, and the arrangements of
the go-betweens, shall bore holes to steal a sight of each other, or get
over the wall to be with each other, then their parents and all other
people will despise them. The ancients did indeed always desire to be in
office, but they also hated being so by any improper way. To seek office by
an improper way is of a class with young people's boring holes.'</p>



<p>1. P'ang Kang asked Mencius, saying, 'Is it not an extravagant procedure
to go from one prince to another and live upon them, followed by several
tens of carriages, and attended by several hundred men?' Mencius replied,
'If there be not a proper ground for taking it, a single bamboo-cup of rice
may not be received from a man. If there be such a proper ground, then
Shun's receiving the kingdom from Y&acirc;o is not to be considered
excessive. Do you think it was excessive?'</p>

<p>2. Kang said, 'No. But for a scholar performing no service to receive
his support notwithstanding is improper.'</p>

<p>3. Mencius answered, 'If you do not have an intercommunication of the
productions of labour, and an interchange of men's services, so that one
from his overplus may supply the deficiency of another, then husbandmen
will have a superfluity of grain, and women will have a superfluity of
cloth. If you have such an interchange, carpenters and carriage-wrights may
all get their food from you. Here now is a man, who, at home, is filial,
and abroad, respectful to his elders; who watches over the principles of
the ancient kings, awaiting the rise of future learners:-- and yet you will
refuse to support him. How is it that you give honour to the carpenter and
carriage-wright, and slight him who practises benevolence and
righteousness?'</p>

<p>4. P'ang Kang said, 'The aim of the carpenter and carriagewright is by
their trades to seek for a living. Is it also the aim of the superior man
in his practice of principles thereby to seek for a living?' 'What have you
to do,' returned Mencius, 'with his purpose? He is of service to you. He
deserves to be supported, and should be supported. And let me ask,-- Do you
remunerate a man's intention, or do you remunerate his service.' To this
Kang replied, 'I remunerate his intention.'</p>

<p>5. Mencius said, 'There is a man here, who breaks your tiles, and draws
unsightly figures on your walls;-- his purpose may be thereby to seek for
his living, but will you indeed remunerate him?' 'No,' said Kang; and
Mencius then concluded, 'That being the case, it is not the purpose which
you remunerate, but the work done.'</p>



<p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'Sung is a small State. Its ruler is
now setting about to practise the true royal government, and Ch'&icirc; and
Ch'&ucirc; hate and attack him. What in this case is to be done?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'When T'ang dwelt in Po, he adjoined to the State of
Ko, the chief of which was living in a dissolute state and neglecting his
proper sacrifices. T'ang sent messengers to inquire why he did not
sacrifice. He replied, "I have no means of supplying the necessary
victims." On this, T'ang caused oxen and sheep to be sent to him, but he
ate them, and still continued not to sacrifice. T'ang again sent messengers
to ask him the same question as before, when he replied, "I have no means
of obtaining the necessary millet."  On this, T'ang sent the mass of the
people of Po to go and till the ground for him, while the old and feeble
carried their food to them. The chief of Ko led his people to intercept
those who were thus charged with wine, cooked rice, millet, and paddy, and
took their stores from them, while they killed those who refused to give
them up. There was a boy who had some millet and flesh for the labourers,
who was thus slain and robbed. What is said in the Book of History, "The
chief of Ko behaved as an enemy to the provision-carriers," has reference
to this.</p>

<p>3. 'Because of his murder of this boy, T'ang proceeded to punish him.
All within the four seas said, "It is not because he desires the riches of
the kingdom, but to avenge a common man and woman."</p>

<p>4. 'When T'ang began his work of executing justice, he commenced with Ko,
and though he made eleven punitive expeditions, he had not an enemy in the
kingdom. When he pursued his work in the east, the rude tribes in the west
murmured. So did those on the north, when he was engaged in the south.
Their cry was-- "Why does he make us last." Thus, the people's longing for
him was like their longing for rain in a time of great drought. The
frequenters of the markets stopped not. Those engaged in weeding in
the fields made no change in their operations. While he punished their
rulers, he consoled the people. His progress was like the falling of
opportune rain, and the people were delighted. It is said in the Book of
History, "We have waited for our prince. When our prince comes, we may
escape from the punishments under which we suffer."</p>

<p>5. 'There being some who would not become the subjects of Ch&acirc;u,
king W&ucirc; proceeded to punish them on the east. He gave tranquillity to
their people, who welcomed him with baskets full of their black and yellow
silks, saying-- "From henceforth we shall serve the sovereign of our
dynasty of Ch&acirc;u, that we may be made happy by him." So they joined
themselves, as subjects, to the great city of Ch&acirc;u. Thus, the men of
station of Shang took baskets full of black and yellow silks to meet the
men of station of Ch&acirc;u, and the lower classes of the one met those of
the other with baskets of rice and vessels of congee. W&ucirc; saved the
people from the midst of fire and water, seizing only their oppressors, and
destroying them.'</p>

<p>6. 'In the Great Declaration it is said, "My power shall be put forth,
and, invading the territories of Shang, I will seize the oppressor. I will
put him to death to punish him:-- so shall the greatness of my work appear,
more glorious than that of T'ang."</p>

<p>7. 'Sung is not, as you say, practising true royal government, and so
forth. If it were practising royal government, all within the four seas
would be lifting up their heads, and looking for its prince, wishing to
have him for their sovereign. Great as Ch'&icirc; and Ch'&ucirc; are, what
would there be to fear from them?'</p>
