<p>Mencius said, 'When it appears proper to take a thing, and afterwards
not proper, to take it is contrary to moderation. When it appears proper to
give a thing and afterwards not proper, to give it is contrary to kindness.
When it appears proper to sacrifice one's life, and afterwards not proper,
to sacrifice it is contrary to bravery.'</p>



<p>1. P'ang Mang learned archery of &Icirc;. When he had acquired
completely all the science of &Icirc;, he thought that in all the kingdom
only &Icirc; was superior to himself, and so he slew him. Mencius said, 'In
this case &Icirc; also was to blame. Kung-ming &Icirc; indeed said, "It
would appear as if he were not to be blamed," but he thereby only meant
that his blame was slight. How can he be held without any blame?'</p>

<p>2. 'The people of Chang sent Tsze-cho Y&uuml; to make a stealthy attack
on Wei, which sent Y&uuml;-kung Sze to pursue him. Tsze-cho Y&uuml; said,
"To-day I feel unwell, so that I cannot hold my bow. I am a dead man!" At
the same time he asked his driver, "Who is it that is pursuing me?" The
driver said, "It is Y&uuml;-kung Sze," on which, he exclaimed, "I shall
live." The driver said, "Y&uuml;-kung Sze is the best archer of Wei, what
do you mean by saying 'I shall live?'" Y&uuml; replied, "Y&uuml;-kung Sze
learned archery from Yin-kung T'o, who again learned it from me. Now,
Yin-kung T'o is an upright man, and the friends of his selection must be
upright also." When Y&uuml;-kung Sze came up, he said, "Master, why are you
not holding your bow?" Y&uuml; answered him, "To-day I am feeling unwell,
and cannot hold my bow." On this Sze said, "I learned archery from Yin-kung
T'o, who again learned it from you. I cannot bear to injure you with your
own science. The business of to-day, however, is the prince's business,
which I dare not neglect." He then took his arrows, knocked off their steel
points against the carriage-wheel, discharged four of them, and
returned.</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'If the lady Hs&icirc; had been covered with a filthy
head-dress, all people would have stopped their noses in passing her.</p>

<p>2. 'Though a man may be wicked, yet if he adjust his thoughts, fast, and
bathe, he may sacrifice to God.'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'All who speak about the natures of things, have in
fact only their phenomena to reason from, and the value of a phenomenon is
in its being natural.</p>

<p>2. 'What I dislike in your wise men is their boring out their
conclusions. If those wise men would only act as Y&uuml; did when he
conveyed away the waters, there would be nothing to dislike in their
wisdom. The manner in which Y&uuml; conveyed away the waters was by doing
what gave him no trouble. If your wise men would also do that which gave
them no trouble, their knowledge would also be great.</p>

<p>3. 'There is heaven so high; there are the stars so distant. If we have
investigated their phenomena, we may, while sitting in our places, go back
to the solstice of a thousand years ago.'</p>



<p>1. The officer Kung-hang having on hand the funeral of one of his sons,
the Master of the Right went to condole with him. When this noble entered
the door, some called him to them and spoke with him, and some went to his
place and spoke with him.</p>

<p>2. Mencius did not speak with him, so that he was displeased, and said,
'All the gentlemen have spoken with me. There is only Mencius who does not
speak to me, thereby slighting me.'</p>

<p>3. Mencius having heard of this remark, said, 'According to the
prescribed rules, in the court, individuals may not change their places to
speak with one another, nor may they pass from their ranks to bow to one
another. I was wishing to observe this rule, and Tsze-&acirc;o understands
it that I was slighting him:-- is not this strange?'</p>



<p>1. Mencius said, 'That whereby the superior man is distinguished from
other men is what he preserves in his heart;-- namely, benevolence and
propriety.</p>

<p>2. 'The benevolent man loves others. The man of propriety shows respect
to others.</p>

<p>3. 'He who loves others is constantly loved by them. He who respects
others is constantly respected by them.</p>

<p>4. 'Here is a man, who treats me in a perverse and unreasonable manner.
The superior man in such a case will turn round upon himself-- "I must have
been wanting in benevolence; I must have been wanting in propriety;-- how
should this have happened to me?"</p>

<p>5. He examines himself, and is specially benevolent. He turns round upon
himself, and is specially observant of propriety. The perversity and
unreasonableness of the other, however, are still the same. The superior
man will again turn round on himself-- "I must have been failing to do my
utmost."</p>

<p>6. 'He turns round upon himself, and proceeds to do his utmost, but
still the perversity and unreasonableness of the other are repeated. On
this the superior man says, "This is a man utterly lost indeed! Since he
conducts himself so, what is there to choose between him and a brute? Why
should I go to contend with a brute?"</p>

<p>7. 'Thus it is that the superior man has a life-long anxiety and not one
morning's calamity. As to what is matter of anxiety to him, that indeed be
has.-- He says, "Shun was a man, and I also am a man. But Shun became an
example to all the kingdom, and his conduct was worthy to be handed down to
after ages, while I am nothing better than a villager." This indeed is the
proper matter of anxiety to him. And in what way is he anxious about it?
Just that he maybe like Shun:-- then only will he stop. As to what the
superior man would feel to be a calamity, there is no such thing. He does
nothing which is not according to propriety. If there should befall him one
morning's calamity, the superior man does not account it a calamity.'</p>



<p>1. Y&uuml; and Ch&icirc;, in an age when the world was being brought
back to order, thrice passed their doors without entering them. Confucius
praised them.</p>

<p>2. The disciple Yen, in an age of disorder, dwelt in a mean narrow lane,
having his single bamboo-cup of rice, and his single gourd-dish of water;
other men could not have endured the distress, but he did not allow his joy
to be affected by it. Confucius praised him.</p>

<p>3. Mencius said, 'Y&uuml;, Ch&icirc;, and Yen H&ucirc;i agreed in the
principle of their conduct.</p>

<p>4. 'Y&uuml; thought that if any one in the kingdom were drowned, it was
as if he drowned him. Ch&icirc; thought that if any one in the kingdom
suffered hunger, it was as if he famished him. It was on this account that
they were so earnest.</p>

<p>5. If Y&uuml; and Ch&icirc;, and Yen-tsze, had exchanged places, each
would have done what the other did.</p>

<p>6. 'Here now in the same apartment with you are people fighting:-- you
ought to part them. Though you part them with your cap simply tied over
your unbound hair, your conduct will be allowable.</p>

<p>7. 'If the fighting be only in the village or neighbourhood, if
you go to put an end to it with your cap tied over your hair unbound, you
will be in error. Although you should shut your door in such a case, your
conduct would be allowable.'</p>



<p>1. The disciple Kung-t&ucirc; said, 'Throughout the whole kingdom
everybody pronounces K'wang Chang unfilial. But you, Master, keep company
with him, and moreover treat him with politeness. I venture to ask why you
do so.'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'There are five things which are pronounced in the
common usage of the age to be unfilial. The first is laziness in the use of
one's four limbs, without attending to the nourishment of his parents. The
second is gambling and chess-playiDg, and being fond of wine, without
attending to the nourishment of his parents. The third is being fond of
goods and money, and selfishly attached to his wife and children, without
attending to the nourishment of his parents. The fourth is following the
desires of one's ears and eyes, so as to bring his parents to disgrace. The
fifth is being fond of bravery, fighting and quarrelling so as to endanger
his parents. Is Chang guilty of any one of these things?</p>

<p>3. 'Now between Chang and his father there arose disagreement, he, the
son, reproving his father, to urge him to what was good.</p>

<p>4. 'To urge one another to what is good by reproofs is the way of
friends. But such urging between father and son is the greatest injury to
the kindness, which should prevail between them.</p>

<p>5. 'Moreover, did not Chang wish to have in his family the relationships
of husband and wife, child and mother? But because he had offended his
father, and was not permitted to approach him, he sent away his wife, and
drove forth his son, and all his life receives no cherishing attention from
them. He settled it in his mind that if he did not act in this way, his
would be one of the greatest of crimes.-- Such and nothing more is the case
of Chang.'</p>



<p>1. When the philosopher Tsang dwelt in W&ucirc;-ch'ang, there came a
band from Y&uuml;eh to plunder it. Someone said to him, 'The plunderers are
coming:-- why not leave this?' Tsang on this left the city, saying to the
man in charge of the house, 'Do not lodge any persons in my house, lest
they break and injure the plants and trees.' When the plunderers withdrew,
he sent word to him, saying, 'Repair the walls of my house. I am about to
return.' When the plunderers retired, the philosopher Tsang returned
accordingly. His disciples said, 'Since our master was treated with so much
sincerity and respect, for him to be the first to go away on the arrival of
the plunderers, so as to be observed by the people, and then to return on
their retiring, appears to us to be improper.' Ch'an-y&ucirc; Hsing said,
'You do not understand this matter. Formerly, when Ch'an-y&ucirc; was
exposed to the outbreak of the grass-carriers, there were seventy disciples
in our master's following, and none of them took part in the matter.'</p>

<p>2. When Tsze-sze was living in Wei, there came a band from Ch'&icirc; to
plunder. Some one said to him, 'The plunderers are coming;-- why not leave
this?' Tsze-sze said, 'If I go away, whom will the prince have to guard the
State with?'</p>

<p>3. Mencius said, 'The philosophers Tsang and Tsze-sze agreed in the
principle of their conduct. Tsang was a teacher;-- in the place of a father
or elder brother. Tsze-sze was a minister;-- in a meaner place. If the
philosophers Tsang and Tsze-sze had exchanged places the one would have
done what the other did.'</p>





<p>1. A man of Ch'&icirc; had a wife and a concubine, and lived together
with them in his house. When their husband went out, he would get himself
well filled with wine and flesh, and then return, and, on his wife's asking
him with whom he ate and drank, they were sure to be all wealthy and
honourable people. The wife informed the concubine, saying, 'When our good
man goes out, he is sure to come back having partaken plentifully of wine
and flesh. I asked with whom he ate and drank, and they are all, it seems,
wealthy and honourable people. And yet no people of distinction ever come
here. I will spy out where our good man goes.' Accordingly, she got up
early in the morning, and privately followed wherever her husband went.
Throughout the whole city, there was no one who stood or talked with him.
At last, he came to those who were sacrificing among the tombs beyond the
outer wall on the east, and begged what they had over. Not being satisfied,
he looked about, and went to another party;-- and this was the way in which
he got himself satiated. His wife returned, and informed the concubine,
saying, 'It was to our husband that we looked up in hopeful contemplation,
with whom our lot is cast for life;-- and now these are his ways!' On this,
along with the concubine she reviled their husband, and they wept together
in the middle hall. In the meantime the husband, knowing nothing of all
this, came in with a jaunty air, carrying himself proudly to his wife and
concubine.</p>

<p>2. In the view of a superior man, as to the ways by which men seek for
riches, honours, gain, and advancement, there are few of their wives and
concubines who would not be ashamed and weep together on account of
them.</p>
