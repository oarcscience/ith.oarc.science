<p>1. Wan Chang said, 'Was it the case that Y&acirc;o gave the throne to
Shun?' Mencius said, 'No. The sovereign cannot give the throne to
another.'</p>

<p>2. 'Yes;-- but Shun had the throne. Who gave it to him?' 'Heaven gave it
to him,' was the answer.</p>

<p>3. '" Heaven gave it to him:"-- did Heaven confer its appointment on him
with specific injunctions?'</p>

<p>4. Mencius replied, 'No. Heaven does not speak. It simply showed its will
by his personal conduct and his conduct of affairs.'</p>

<p>5. '"It showed its will by his personal conduct and his conduct of
affairs:"-- how was this?' Mencius's answer was, 'The sovereign can present
a man to Heaven, but he cannot make Heaven give that man the throne. A
prince can present a man to the sovereign, but he cannot cause the
sovereign to make that man a prince. A great officer can present a man to
his prince, but he cannot cause the prince to make that man a great
officer. Y&acirc;o presented Shun to Heaven, and Heaven accepted him. He
presented him to the people, and the people accepted him. Therefore I say,
"Heaven does not speak. It simply indicated its will by his personal
conduct and his conduct of affairs."'</p>

<p>6. Chang said, 'I presume to ask how it was that Y&acirc;o presented
Shun to Heaven, and Heaven accepted him; and that he exhibited him to the
people, and the people accepted him.' Mencius replied, 'He caused him to
preside over the sacrifices, and all the spirits were well pleased with
them;-- thus Heaven accepted him. He caused him to preside over the conduct
of affairs, and affairs were well administered, so that the people reposed
under him;-- thus the people accepted him. Heaven gave the throne to him.
The people gave it to him. Therefore I said, "The sovereign cannot give the
throne to another."</p>

<p>7. 'Shun assisted Y&acirc;o in the government for twenty and eight
years;-- this was more than man could have done, and was from Heaven. After
the death of Y&acirc;o, when the three years' mourning was completed, Shun
withdrew from the son of Y&acirc;o to the south of South river. The princes
of the kingdom, however, repairing to court, went not to the son of
Y&acirc;o, but they went to Shun. Litigants went not to the son of
Y&acirc;o, but they went to Shun. Singers sang not the son of Y&acirc;o,
but they sang Shun. Therefore I said, "Heaven gave him the throne." It was
after these things that he went to the Middle Kingdom, and occupied the
seat of the Son of Heaven. If he had, before these things, taken up his
residence in the palace of Y&acirc;o, and had applied pressure to the son
of Y&acirc;o, it would have been an act of usurpation, and not the gift of
Heaven.</p>

<p>8. 'This sentiment is expressed in the words of The Great Declaration,--
"Heaven sees according as my people see; Heaven hears according as my people
hear."'</p>



<p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say, "When the disposal of
the kingdom came to Y&uuml;, his virtue was inferior to that of Y&acirc;o
and Shun, and he transmitted it not to the worthiest but to his son." Was
it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it was not so. When Heaven gave the kingdom
to the worthiest, it was given to the worthiest. When Heaven gave it to the
son of the preceding sovereign, it was given to him. Shun presented Y&uuml;
to Heaven. Seventeen years elapsed, and Shun died. When the three years'
mourning was expired, Y&uuml; withdrew from the son of Shun to Yang-ch'ang.
The people of the kingdom followed him just as after the death of
Y&acirc;o, instead of following his son, they had followed Shun. Y&uuml;
presented Y&icirc; to Heaven. Seven years elapsed, and Y&uuml; died. When
the three years' mourning was expired, Y&icirc; withdrew from the son of
Y&uuml; to the north of mount Ch'&icirc;. The princes, repairing to court,
went not to Y&icirc;, but they went to Ch'&icirc;. Litigants did not go to
Y&icirc;, but they went to Ch'&icirc;, saying, "He is the son of our
sovereign;" the singers did not sing Y&icirc;, but they sang Ch'&icirc;,
saying, "He is the son of our sovereign."</p>

<p>2. 'That Tan-ch&ucirc; was not equal to his father, and Shun's son not
equal to his; that Shun assisted Y&acirc;o, and Y&uuml; assisted Shun, for
many years, conferring benefits on the people for a long time; that thus
the length of time during which Shun, Y&uuml;, and Y&icirc; assisted in the
government was so different; that Ch'&icirc; was able, as a man of talents
and virtue, reverently to pursue the same course as Y&uuml;; that Y&icirc;
assisted Y&uuml; only for a few years, and had not long conferred benefits
on the people; that the periods of service of the three were so different;
and that the sons were one superior, and the other superior:-- all this was
from Heaven, and what could not be brought about by man. That which is done
without man's doing is from Heaven. That which happens without man's
causing is from the ordinance of Heaven.</p>

<p>3. 'In the case of a private individual obtaining the throne, there must
be in him virtue equal to that of Shun or Y&uuml;; and moreover there must
be the presenting of him to Heaven by the preceding sovereign. It was on
this account that Confucius did not obtain the throne.</p>

<p>4. 'When the kingdom is possessed by natural succession, the sovereign
who is displaced by Heaven must be like Chieh or Ch&acirc;u. It was on this
account that Y&icirc;, &Icirc; Yin, and Ch&acirc;u-kung did not obtain the
throne.</p>

<p>5. '&Icirc; Yin assisted T'ang so that he became sovereign over the
kingdom. After the demise of T'ang, T'&acirc;i-ting having died before he
could be appointed sovereign, W&acirc;'i-ping reigned two years, and
Chung-zin four. T'&acirc;i-chi&acirc; was then turning upside down the
statutes of T'ang, when &Icirc; Yin placed him in T'ung for three years.
There T'&acirc;i-chi&acirc; repented of his errors, was contrite, and
reformed himself. In T'ung be came to dwell in benevolence and walk in
righteousness, during those threee years, listening to the lessons given to
him by &Icirc; Yin.  Then &Icirc; Yin again returned with him to Po.</p>

<p>6. 'Ch&acirc;u-kung not getting the throne was like the case of Y&icirc;
and the throne of Hsi&acirc;, or like that of &Icirc; Yin and the throne of
Yin.</p>

<p>7. 'Confucius said, "T'ang and Y&uuml; resigned the throne to their
worthy ministers. The sovereign of Hsi&acirc; and those of Yin and
Ch&acirc;u transmitted it to their sons. The principle of righteousness was
the same in all the cases."'</p>



<p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'People say that &Icirc; Yin
sought an introduction to T'ang by his knowledge of cookery. Was it
so?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'No, it was not so. &Icirc; Yin was a farmer in the
lands of the prince of Hsin, delighting in the principles of Y&acirc;o and
Shun. In any matter contrary to the righteousness which they prescribed, or
contrary to their principles, though he had been offered the throne, he
would not have regarded it; though there had been yoked for him a thousand
teams of horses, he would not have looked at them. In any matter contrary
to the righteousness which they prescribed, or contrary to their
principles, he would neither have given nor taken a single straw.</p>

<p>3. 'T'ang sent persons with presents of silk to entreat him to enter his
service. With an air of indifference and self-satisfaction he said, "What
can I do with those silks with which T'ang invites me? Is it not best for
me to abide in the channelled fields, and so delight myself with the
principles of Y&acirc;o and Shun?"</p>

<p>4. 'T'ang thrice sent messengers to invite him. After this, with the
change of resolution displayed in his countenance, he spoke in a different
style,-- "Instead of abiding in the channelled fields and thereby
delighting myself with the principles of Y&acirc;o and Shun, had I not
better make this prince a prince like Y&acirc;o or Shun, and this people
like the people of Y&acirc;o or Shun ? Had I not better in my own person
see these things for myself?</p>

<p>5. '"Heaven's plan in the production of mankind is this:-- that they who
are first informed should instruct those who are later in being informed,
and they who first apprehend principles should instruct those who are
slower to do so. I am one of Heaven's people who have first apprehended;--
I will take these principles and instruct this people in them. If I do not
instruct them, who will do so?"</p>

<p>6. 'He thought that among all the people of the kingdom, even the
private men and women, if there were any who did not enjoy such benefits as
Y&acirc;o and Shun conferred, it was as if he himself pushed them into a
ditch. He took upon himself the heavy charge of the kingdom in this way,
and therefore he went to T'ang, and pressed upon him the subject of
attacking Hsi&acirc; and saving the people.</p>

<p>7. 'I have not heard of one who bent himself, and at the same time made
others straight;-- how much less could one disgrace himself, and thereby
rectify the whole kingdom? The actions of the sages have been different.
Some have kept remote from court, and some have drawn near to it; some have
left their offices, and some have not done so:-- that to which those
different courses all agree is simply the keeping of their persons
pure.</p>

<p>8. 'I have heard that &Icirc; Yin sought an introduction to T'ang by the
doctrines of Y&acirc;o and Shun. I have not heard that he did so by his
knowledge of cookery.</p>

<p>9. 'In the "Instructions of &Icirc;," it is said, "Heaven destroying
Chieh commenced attacking him in the palace of M&ucirc;. I commenced in
Po."'</p>



<p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, saying, 'Some say that Confucius, when he
was in Wei, lived with the ulcer-doctor, and when he was in Ch'&icirc;,
with the attendant, Ch'&icirc; Hwan;-- was it so?' Mencius replied, 'No; it
was not so. Those are the inventions of men fond of strange things.</p>

<p>2. 'When he was in Wei, he lived with Yen Ch'&acirc;u-y&ucirc;. The
wives of the officer M&icirc; and Tsze-l&ucirc; were sisters, and M&icirc;
told Tsze-l&ucirc;, "If Confucius will lodge with me, he may attain to the
dignity of a high noble of Wei." Tsze-l&ucirc; informed Confucius of this,
and he said, "That is as ordered by Heaven." Confucius went into office
according to propriety, and retired from it according to righteousness. In
regard to his obtaining office or not obtaining it, he said, "That is as
ordered." But if he had lodged with the attendant Ch&icirc; Hwan, that
would neither have been according to righteousness, nor any ordering of
Heaven.</p>

<p>3. 'When Confucius, being dissatisfied in L&ucirc; and Wei, had left those
States, he met with the attempt of Hwan, the Master of the Horse, of Sung,
to intercept and kill him. He assumed, however, the dress of a common man,
and passed by Sung. At that time, though he was in circumstances of
distress, he lodged with the city-master Ch'ang, who was then a minister of
Ch&acirc;u, the marquis of Ch'an.</p>

<p>4. 'I have heard that the characters of ministers about court may be
discerned from those whom they entertain, and those of stranger officers,
from those with whom they lodge. If Confucius had lodged with the
ulcer-doctor, and with the attendant Ch&icirc; Hwan, how could he have been
Confucius?'</p>



<p>1. Wan Chang asked Mencius, 'Some say that P&acirc;i-l&icirc; Hs&icirc;
sold himself to a cattle-keeper of Ch'in for the skins of five rams, and
fed his oxen, in order to find an introduction to the duke M&ucirc; of
Ch'in;-- was this the case?' Mencius said, 'No; it was not so. This story
was invented by men fond of strange things.</p>

<p>2. 'P&acirc;i-l&icirc; Hs&icirc; was a man of Y&uuml;. The people of
Tsin, by the inducement of a round piece of jade from
Ch'&ucirc;i-ch&icirc;, and four horses of the Ch'&uuml; breed, borrowed a
passage through Y&uuml; to attack Kwo. On that occasion, Kung
Chih-ch'&icirc; remonstrated against granting their request, and
P&acirc;i-l&icirc; Hs&icirc; did not remonstrate.</p>

<p>3. 'When he knew that the duke of Y&uuml; was not to be remonstrated
with, and, leaving that State, went to Ch'in, he had reached the age of
seventy. If by that time he did not know that it would be a mean thing to
seek an introduction to the duke M&ucirc; of Ch'in by feeding oxen, could
he be called wise? But not remonstrating where it was of no use to
remonstrate, could he be said not to be wise? Knowing that the duke of
Y&uuml; would be ruined, and leaving him before that event, he cannot be
said not to have been wise. Being then advanced in Ch'in, he knew that the
duke M&ucirc; was one with whom he would enjoy a field for action, and
became minister to him;-- could he, acting thus, be said not to be wise?
Having become chief minister of Ch'in, he made his prince distinguished
throughout the kingdom, and worthy of being handed down to future ages;--
could he have done this, if he had not been a man of talents and virtue? As
to selling himself in order to accomplish all the aims of his prince, even
a villager who had a regard for himself would not do such a thing; and
shall we say that a man of talents and virtue did it?'</p>
