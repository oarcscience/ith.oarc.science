<p>1. A man of Zan asked the disciple W&ucirc;-l&ucirc;, saying, 'Is an
observance of the rules of propriety in regard to eating, or eating merely,
the more important?' The answer was, 'The observance of the rules of
propriety is the more important.'</p>

<p>2. 'Is the gratifying the appetite of sex, or the doing so only
according to the rules of propriety, the more important?' The answer again
was, 'The observance of the rules of propriety in the matter is the more
important.'</p>

<p>3. The man pursued, 'If the result of eating only according to the rules
of propriety will be death by starvation, while by disregarding those rules
we may get food, must they still be observed in such a case? If according
to the rule that he shall go in person to meet his wife a man cannot get
married, while by disregarding that rule he may get married, must he still
observe the rule in such a case?'</p>

<p>4. W&ucirc;-l&ucirc; was unable to reply to these questions, and the
next day he went to Ts&acirc;u, and told them to Mencius. Mencius said,
'What difficulty is there in answering these inquiries?'</p>

<p>5. 'If you do not adjust them at their lower extremities, but only put
their tops on a level, a piece of wood an inch square may be made to be
higher than the pointed peak of a high building.</p>

<p>6. 'Gold is heavier than feathers;-- but does that saying have
reference, on the one hand, to a single clasp of gold, and, on the other,
to a waggon-load of feathers?</p>

<p>7. 'If you take a case where the eating is of the utmost importance and
the observing the rules of propriety is of little importance, and compare
the things together, why stop with saying merely that the eating is more
important? So, taking the case where the gratifying the appetite of sex is
of the utmost importance and the observing the rules of propriety is of
little importance, why stop with merely saying that the gratifying the
appetite is the more important?</p>

<p>8. 'Go and answer him thus, "If, by twisting your elder brother's arm,
and snatching from him what he is eating, you can get food for yourself,
while, if you do not do so, you will not get anything to eat, will you so
twist his arm ? If by getting over your neighbour's wall, and dragging away
his virgin daughter, you can get a wife, while if you do not do so, you
will not be able to get a wife, will you so drag her away?"'</p>



<p>1. Chi&acirc;o of Ts&acirc;o asked Mencius, saying, 'It is said,
"All men may be Y&acirc;os and Shuns;"-- is it so?' Mencius replied, It
is.'</p>

<p>2. Chi&acirc;o went on, 'I have heard that king Wan was ten cubits high,
and T'ang nine. Now I am nine cubits four inches in height. But I can do
nothing but eat my millet. What am I to do to realize that saying?'</p>

<p>3. Mencius answered him, 'What has this-- the question of size--- to do
with the matter? It all lies simply in acting as such. Here is a man, whose
strength was not equal to lift a duckling:-- he was then a man of no
strength. But to-day he says, "I can lift 3,000 catties' weight," and he is
a man of strength. And so, he who can lift the weight which W&ucirc; Hwo
lifted is just another W&ucirc; Hwo. Why should a man make a want of
ability the subject of his grief? It is only that he will not do the
thing.</p>

<p>4. 'To walk slowly, keeping behind his elders, is to perform the part of
a younger. To walk quickly and precede his elders, is to violate the duty
of a younger brother. Now, is it what a man cannot do-- to walk slowly? It
is what he does not do. The course of Y&acirc;o and Shun was simply that of
filial piety and fraternal duty.</p>

<p>5. 'Wear the clothes of Y&acirc;o, repeat the words of Y&acirc;o, and do
the actions of Y&acirc;o, and you will just be a Y&acirc;o. And, if you
wear the clothes of Chieh, repeat the words of Chieh, and do the actions of
Chieh, you will just be a Chieh.'</p>

<p>6. Chi&acirc;o said, 'I shall be having an interview with the prince of
Ts&acirc;u, and can ask him to let me have a house to lodge in. I wish to
remain here, and receive instruction at your gate.'</p>

<p>7. Mencius replied, 'The way of truth is like a great road. It is not
difficult to know it. The evil is only that men will not seek it. Do you go
home and search for it, and you will have abundance of teachers.'</p>



<p>1. Kung-sun Ch'&acirc;u asked about an opinion of the scholar K&acirc;o,
saying, 'K&acirc;o observed, "The Hsi&acirc;o P'&acirc;n is the ode of a
little man."' Mencius asked, 'Why did he say so?' 'Because of the murmuring
which it expresses,' was the reply.</p>

<p>2. Mencius answered, 'How stupid was that old K&acirc;o in dealing with
the ode! There is a man here, and a native of Y&uuml;eh bends his bow to
shoot him. I will advise him not to do so, but speaking calmly and
smilingly;-- for no other reason but that he is not related to me. But if
my own brother be bending his bow to shoot the man, then I will advise him
not to do so, weeping and crying the while;-- for no other reason than that
he is related to me. The dissatisfaction expressed in the Hsi&acirc;o
P'&acirc;n is the working of relative affection, and that affection shows
benevolence. Stupid indeed was old K&acirc;o's criticism on the ode.'</p>

<p>3. Ch'&acirc;u then said, 'How is it that there is no dissatisfaction
expressed in the K'&acirc;i Fang?'</p>

<p>4. Mencius replied, 'The parent's fault referred to in the K'&acirc;i
Fang is small; that referred to in the Hsi&acirc;o P'&acirc;n is great.
Where the parent's fault was great, not to have murmured on account of it
would have increased the want of natural affection. Where the parent's
fault was small, to have murmured on account of it would have been to act
like water which frets and foams about a stone that interrupts its course.
To increase the want of natural affection would have been unfilial, and to
fret and foam in such a manner would also have been unfilial.</p>

<p>5 'Confucius said, "Shun was indeed perfectly filial! And yet, when he
was fifty, he was full of longing desire about his parents."'</p>



<p>1. Sung K'ang being about to go to Ch'&ucirc;, Mencius met him in
Shih-ch'i&ucirc;.</p>

<p>2. 'Master, where are you going?' asked Mencius.</p>

<p>3. K'ang replied, 'I have heard that Ch'in and Ch'&ucirc; are fighting
together, and I am going to see the king of Ch'&ucirc; and persuade him to
cease hostilities. If he shall not be pleased with my advice, I shall go to
see the king of Ch'in, and persuade him in the same way. Of the two kings I
shall surely find that I can succeed with one of them.'</p>

<p>4. Mencius said, 'I will not venture to ask about the particulars, but I
should like to hear the scope of your plan. What course will you take to
try to persuade them?' K'ang answered, 'I will tell them how unprofitable
their course is to them.' 'Master,' said Mencius, 'your aim is great, but
your argument is not good.</p>

<p>5. 'If you, starting from the point of profit, offer your persuasive
counsels to the kings of Ch'in and Ch'&ucirc;, and if those kings are
pleased with the consideration of profit so as to stop the movements of
their armies, then all belonging to those armies will rejoice in the
cessation of war, and find their pleasure in the pursuit of profit.
Ministers will serve their sovereign for the profit of which they cherish
the thought; sons will serve their fathers, and younger brothers will serve
their elder brothers, from the same consideration:-- and the issue will be,
that, abandoning benevolence and righteousness, sovereign and minister,
father and son, younger brother and elder, will carry on all their
intercourse with this thought of profit cherished in their breasts. But
never has there been such a state of society, without ruin being the result
of it.</p>

<p>6. 'If you, starting from the ground of benevolence and righteousness,
offer your counsels to the kings of Ch'in and Ch'&ucirc;, and if those
kings are pleased with the consideration of benevolence and righteousness
so as to stop the operations of their armies, then all belonging to those
armies will rejoice in the stopping from war, and find their pleasure in
benevolence and righteousness. Ministers will serve their sovereign,
cherishing the principles of benevolence and righteousness; sons will serve
their fathers, and younger brothers will serve their elder brothers, in the
same way:-- and so, sovereign and minister, father and son, elder brother
and younger, abandoning the thought of profit, will cherish the principles
of benevolence and righteousness, and carry on all their intercourse upon
them. But never has there been such a state of society, without the State
where it prevailed rising to the royal sway. Why must you use that word
"profit."'</p>



<p>1. When Mencius was residing in Ts&acirc;u, the younger brother of the
chief of Zan, who was guardian of Zan at the time, paid his respects to him
by a present of silks, which Mencius received, not going to acknowledge it.
When he was sojourning in P'ing-l&ucirc;, Ch'&ucirc;, who was prime
minister of the State, sent him a similar present, which he received in the
same way.</p>

<p>2. Subsequently, going from Ts&acirc;u to Zan, he visited the guardian;
but when he went from Ping-l&ucirc; to the capital of Ch'&icirc;, he did
not visit the minister Ch'&ucirc;. The disciple W&ucirc;-l&ucirc; was glad,
and said, 'I have got an opportunity to obtain some instruction.'</p>

<p>3. He asked accordingly, 'Master, when you went to Zan, you visited the
chief's brother; and when you went to Ch'&icirc;, you did not visit
Ch'&ucirc;. Was it not because he is only the minister?'</p>

<p>4. Mencius replied, 'No. It is said in the Book of History, "In
presenting an offering to a superior, most depends on the demonstrations of
respect. If those demonstrations are not equal to the things offeredred, we
say there is no offering, that is, there is no act of the will presenting
the offering."</p>

<p>5. 'This is because the things so offered do not constitute an offering
to a superior.'</p>

<p>6. W&ucirc;-l&ucirc; was pleased, and when some one asked him what
Mencius meant, he said, 'The younger of Zan could not go to Ts&acirc;u, but
the minister Ch'&ucirc; might have gone to P'ing-l&ucirc;.'</p>



<p>1. Shun-y&uuml; K'wan said, 'He who makes fame and meritorious services
his first objects, acts with a regard to others. He who makes them only
secondary objects, acts with a regard to himself. You, master, were ranked
among the three chief ministers of the State, but before your fame and
services had reached either to the prince or the people, you have left your
place. Is this indeed the way of the benevolent?'</p>

<p>2. Mencius replied, 'There was Po'&icirc;;-- he abode in an inferior
situation, and would not, with his virtue, serve a degenerate prince. There
was &Icirc; Yin;-- he five times went to T'ang, and five times went to
Chieh. There was H&ucirc;i of Li&ucirc;-hsi&acirc;;-- he did not disdain to
serve a vile prince, nor did he decline a small office. The courses pursued
by those three worthies were different, but their aim was one. And what was
their one aim? We must answer-- "To be perfectly virtuous." And so it is
simply after this that superior men strive. Why must they all pursue the
same course?'</p>

<p>3. K'wan pursued, 'In the time of the duke M&ucirc; of L&ucirc;, the
government was in the hands of Kung-&icirc;, while Tsze-li&ucirc; and
Tsze-sze were ministers. And yet, the dismemberment of L&ucirc; then
increased exceedingly. Such was the case, a specimen how your men of virtue
are of no advantage to a kingdom!'</p>

<p>4. Mencius said, 'The prince of Y&uuml; did not use P&acirc;i-l&icirc;
Hsi, and thereby lost his State. The duke M&ucirc; of Chin used him, and
became chief of all the princes. Ruin is the consequence of not employing
men of virtue and talents;-- how can it rest with dismemberment
merely?'</p>

<p>5. K'wan urged again, 'Formerly, when Wang P'&acirc;o dwelt on the
Ch'&icirc;, the people on the west of the Yellow River all became skilful
at singing in his abrupt manner. When Mien Ch'&uuml; lived in
K&acirc;o-t'ang, the people in the parts of Ch'&icirc; on the west became
skilful at singing in his prolonged manner. The wives of Hwa Ch&acirc;u and
Ch'&icirc; Liang bewailed their husbands so skilfully, that they changed
the manners of the State. When there is the gift within, it manifests
itself without. I have never seen the man who could do the deeds of a
worthy, and did not realize the work of one. Therefore there are now no men
of talents and virtue. If there were, I should know them.'</p>

<p>6. Mencius answered, 'When Confucius was chief minister of Justice in
L&ucirc;, the prince came not to follow his counsels. Soon after there was
the solstitial sacrifice, and when a part of the flesh presented in
sacrifice was not sent to him, he went away even without taking off his cap
of ceremony. Those who did not know him supposed it was on account of the
flesh. Those who knew him supposed that it was on account of the neglect of
the usual ceremony. The fact was, that Confucius wanted to go away on
occasion of some small offence, not wishing to do so without some apparent
cause. All men cannot be expected to understand the conduct of a superior
man.'</p>
