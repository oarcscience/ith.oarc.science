<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Tsai Shan*; narrative. The cultivation of the ground, from the
first breaking of it up till it yields abundant harvests;—available
specially for sacrifices and on festive occasions.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

The toilers come to clear the ground,  
Where grass and brushwood thick abound,  
Where plowshare never yet was found. <span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

In thousands now they gather there;  
And side by side, and pair by pair,  
The roots from out the soil they tear:—

Some in the marshes lying low;  
Some where the dry paths winding go;  
Some where the running waters flow.

The master see, inspecting all;  
His sons, responsive to his call;  
Their households also, great and small.

With them are neighbors, strong and true,  
Who come all helpful work to do;  
And servants hired are present too.

Hark! how the merry feast goes round!  
The husbands’ hearts with love abound;  
Their wives close by their sides are found.

Now they begin with patient care  
The southern acres to prepare.  
The soil is broken by the share.

They sow the various grains; each ear  
With mystic life will soon appear,  
When the young plants their heads uprear. <span id="page_456">p.
456</span>

Behold in lines unbroken rise  
The tender blades, whose lengthening size  
Gains daily growth before our eyes!

Luxuriant is the sprouting grain,  
And through it goes a numerous train.  
Who weed it o’er and o’er again.

Erelong their work the reapers ply,  
The golden grain is piled on high;  
The stalks unnumbered multiply:—

Enough to make the spirits sweet,  
To offer at our fathers’ feet;  
To furnish what for rites is meet;

Enough, when at the fragrant board  
Sit host and guest, for king and lord  
The glorious banquet to afford;

Enough, when now the feast is o’er,  
To satisfy the aged poor,  
And cheer them from the unfailing store.

Nor now alone, but from of old,  
And everywhere's the story told,  
Toil reaps from earth a thousandfold.
