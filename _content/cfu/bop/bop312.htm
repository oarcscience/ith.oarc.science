<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Hs&uuml;an Niao;</i> narrative. Appropriate to a sacrifice in the ancestral temple of Shang:&#8212;intended specially to do honor to the king Wu-ting and the celebrating monarch.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">By Heaven sent down, the swallow came to earth,<br> And gave to our great Ch&#8216;i his mystic birth.<br> The sire of Shang, his children long abode<br> In Yin-land, waxing great. Thereafter God<br> Give to the martial T&#8216;ang his charge, that he<br> Should to each state assign its boundary.</p>  
<p>T&#8216;ang grandly thus possessed the regions nine,<br> And to each quarter did its lords assign.<br> First lord of Shang, the sovereign power who swayed,<br> He got his charge, certain and stable made.<br> Thus to our king the throne. Wu-ting conveyed.</p>  
<p>Wu-ting's descendant is a martial king,<br> Whose powers, however taxed, still victory bring.<br> Ten lords, whose chariots dragon banners grace,<br> His millet dishes in due order place. <a name="page_482"><font size="1" color="green">p. 482</font></A></p>  
<p>A thousand li extends the king's domain,<br> And there the people to repose are fain.<br> Lo! to the four seas thence our borders spread,<br> And from the space within there come to aid<br> Our temple service many chiefs arrayed.<br> Our hill of King for border has the Ho.<br> &#8217;Twas right the sovereignty to Shang should go;<br> And from its ruler now all honors flow.</div></p>
