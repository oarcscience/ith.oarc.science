#### IV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Jih Yüeh;* narrative. Chuang Chiang complains of, and appeals
against, the bad treatment which she received from her husband.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  O sun so bright,
O moon so fair,  
    This lower earth that light,  
  Behold this man, so bold to dare  
    Transgress the ancient right.  
How shall he fix his restless mind?  
Would he not then to me be kind? <span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  O sun, O moon,
whose shining vault  
    O’erspreads this earth below,  
  Behold this man, with willful fault,  
    Kindness refuse to show.  
His restless mind how shall he turn?  
He could not then my fondness spurn.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  O sun, O moon,
in upper sphere,  
    That from the east come forth,  
  This man speaks phrases sounding fair,  
    But all of little worth.  
Were but his mind to goodness set,  
He could not me so much forget.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>  O sun so bright,
O moon so fair,  
    That from the east forth come;  
  O parents dear, whose tender care  
    Ne’er comes in this new home;  
If fixed his mind, ’gainst reason sage  
He could not thus my heart outrage.

</div>
