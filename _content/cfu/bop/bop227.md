#### IV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘ê Hsia;* narrative and allusive. The rejoicing of a bridegroom
over his young, beautiful, and virtuous bride.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>With axle
creaking, all on fire I went,  
  To fetch my young and lovely bride.  
No thirst or hunger pangs my bosom rent,—  
  I only longed to have her by my side.  
I feast with her, whose virtue fame had told,  
Nor need we friends our rapture to behold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The long-tailed
pheasants surest covert find,  
  Amid the forest on the plain.  
Here from my virtuous bride, of noble mind,  
  And person tall, I wisdom gain.  
I praise her while we feast, and to her say,  
"The love I bear you ne’er will know decay.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>"Poor we may be;
spirits and viands fine  
  My humble means will not afford. <span id="page_301">p. 301</span>  
But what we have, we'll taste and not repine;  
  From us will come no grumbling word.  
And though to you no virtue I can add,  
Yet we will sing and dance, in spirit glad.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>"I oft ascend that
lofty ridge with toil,  
  And hew large branches from the oaks;  
Then of their leafy glory them I spoil,  
  And fagots form with vigorous strokes.  
Returning tired, your matchless grace I see,  
And my whole soul dissolves in ecstasy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>"To the high hills
I looked, and urged each steed;  
  The great road next was smooth and plain.  
Up hill, o’er dale, I never slackened speed;  
  Like lutestring sounded every rein.  
I knew, my journey ended, I should come  
To you, sweet bride, the comfort of my home."

</div>
