<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘ê Kung;* narrative. Celebrating a great hunting, presided over
by King Hsüan, on occasion of his giving audience to the feudal princes
at the eastern capital of Lu.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Our chariots were
well built and firm,  
  Well matched our steeds, and fleet and strong.  
Four, sleek and large, each chariot drew,  
  And eastward thus we drove along.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Our hunting cars
were light and good,  
  Each with its team of noble steeds.  
Still further east we took the way  
  To Fu mere's grassy plains that leads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Loud-voiced, the
masters of the chase  
  Arranged the huntsmen, high and low. <span id="page_220">p.
220</span>  
While banners streamed, and oxtails flew,  
  We sought the prey on distant Gaou.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Each with full
team, the princes came,  
  A lengthened train in bright array.  
In gold-wrought slippers, kneecaps red,  
  They looked as on an audience day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Each right thumb
wore the metal guard;  
  On the left arm its shield was bound.  
In unison the arrows flew;  
  The game lay piled upon the ground.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>The leaders of the
tawny teams  
  Sped on their course, direct and true.  
The drivers perfect skill displayed;  
  Like blow well aimed each arrow flew.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>Neighing and
pleased, the steeds returned;  
  The bannered lines back slowly came.  
No jostling rude disgraced the crowd;  
  The king declined large share of game.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>So did this famous
hunt proceed!  
  So free it was from clamorous sound!  
Well does our king become his place,  
  And high the deeds his reign have crowned!
