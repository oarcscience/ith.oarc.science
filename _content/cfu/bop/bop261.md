<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The south wind
swept across the hill;  
Its whistling sound each nook did fill..  
  Our happy, courteous king  
Was there, and, as he roamed about,  
In tuneful notes his joy gave out.  
  Then I began to sing. <span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>"You roam, with
jocund spirits blest,  
And now, serene, at ease you rest,  
  O happy, courteous king!  
May you your destined years fulfill,  
And, like your noble fathers still,  
  Life to good issue bring!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>"How vast and
glorious is your realm,  
Where peace sits steadfast at the helm,  
  O happy, courteous lord!  
May you your destined years complete,  
While ever as their host you treat  
  All spirits at your board!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>"Heaven to your
sires assigned the crown,  
To you ’mid greatest peace come down,  
  O happy, courteous king!  
Through all your term of years, may joy  
And happiness without alloy,  
  Their charm around you fling! <span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>"Men filial
proved, and virtuous, stand  
Near to your throne on either hand,  
  Wise guidance to afford.  
Like wings they bear you up on high,  
Where you their pattern all descry,  
  O happy, courteous lord!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>"Like mace of
jade, pure, clear, and strong,  
What majesty and grace belong  
  To those, your helpers true!  
The hope of all, their praise all sing.  
Through them, O courteous, happy king,  
  The nation's guide are you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>"See how the
phœnixes appear,  
And their wings rustle on the ear,  
  As now they settle down!  
Such are those noble men who wait,  
O happy king, upon your state,  
  The servants of your crown! <span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>"The male and
female phœnix, lo!  
With rustling wings about they go,  
  Then up to heaven they soar.  
Such are those noble men who stand,  
Prompt to obey your least command;—  
  None love your people more.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9">9</span></span>"Hark how the
phœnixes emit  
Their notes, as on that ridge they sit!  
  There the dryandras grow,  
And on its eastern slope they rise  
With richer growth; and thence the cries  
  Sweet and still sweeter flow!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span>"Numerous your
chariots! Fleet your steeds,  
And trained! Your name for noble deeds  
  Shall be renowned for long.  
O king, these verses I have made,  
And humbly at your feet they're laid,  
  Inspired by your own song."
