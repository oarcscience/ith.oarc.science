Textual Heritage

#### IX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Shih Yüeh Chih Chiao;* narrative. Lamentation of an officer over
prodigies, celestial and terrestrial, betokening the ruin of Chou. He
expounds the true causes of these and the abounding misery; names the
chief culprits, and declares his own determination to remain at his post
of duty.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The sun and moon
met in the upper sphere,  
The day *Hsin-mao*, the tenth month of the year.  
The moon was new, as she should reappear,  
And then the sun, eclipsed, showed evils near.  
The moon eclipsed before, and now the sun!  
Alas! we men below shall be undone. <span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>These bodies,
erring, what is bad make known;—  
Good men neglected; order all o’erthrown.  
The moon eclipsed was what full oft takes place;  
The sun's eclipse portends a sadder case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>And flashing levin
shows the want of rest.  
With troubled streams, and tumbling mountain's crest.  
Large heights subside to vales; deep vales grow hills.  
Alas! how does the king not stop these ills?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Among the
ministers great Huang presides;  
In all their duties Fan the people guides;  
Chia-pai administers; Chung-yün is cook;  
The king's decrees Tsou enters in his book;  
Chüeh regulates the stud; the guards Yü's sphere;  
The wife, in beauty blazing, has no fear. <span id="page_246">p.
246</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Great Huang,
determined his own course pursues,  
Demands our service, nor inquires our views;  
Unroofs our homes; our fields makes moor or marsh;  
And "’Tis the law," he says, "I am not harsh."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Farseeing Huang
has built himself a town.  
Three ministers are there of wealth o’ergrown.  
No single chief he left to guard our king,  
While all its streets with hoof and chariot ring.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>I dare not my own
services report;  
But slanderous tongues my blameless life distort.  
Our ills come not from Heaven, but fawning words  
And hidden hate, which schemers wield like swords.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>Far off my
village, great my lack of peace,  
And elsewhere I might go to seek for ease.  
Others retire, but I shall not be driven  
From this my post, though dark the way of Heaven.

</div>
