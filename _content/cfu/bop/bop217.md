#### IV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ku Chung;* narrative. Supposed to refer to and deplore some
expedition of King Yu to the country about the Huai, where he abandoned
himself to the delights of music.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>          How peal
the royal bells,  
As the Huai sweeps along to the main!  
          A tale their music tells,  
Waking thoughts in my mind full of pain.  
          Before me back it sadly brings  
          The memory of our virtuous kings;  
And they live in my fancy again! <span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>          Loud
roll the royal drums,  
As the Huai rushes on to the deep.  
          A vanished memory comes  
In their sound which compels me to weep,—  
          The memory of our kings of old,  
          Whose virtue flawless still we hold,  
Though the kings in their sepulchers sleep.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>          Bells
peal and drums resound,  
As the Huai its three islands displays.  
          They stir a grief profound  
In my heart that no revel allays.  
          The virtue of our kings of yore  
          A stamp of truth and beauty bore,  
Such as never we see nowadays.

<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_4">4</span></span>          *Ch‘in-ch‘in* the bells peal on,  
And the lutes in the concert we hear.  
          Deep breathes the organ tone;  
Sounding stones join their notes, rich and clear.  
          The while through the vessel there ring  
          The *Ya* and the *Nan* which they sing,  
And the dancers with flutes now appear.

</div>
