<div style="font-size: 90%">

marriage, relates his disappointment, and the unworthy cause of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>All through the
fields I traveled sad,  
  Th’ ailanthus foul my only shade.  
Through our relationship I came,  
  Shelter to find with you and aid.  
But me you show no wish to entertain;—  
Back to my state and clan I go again!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>All through the
fields I traveled sad,  
  And for my food the sheep's-foot cooked.  
Through our relationship, to you  
  For lodging for a time I looked.  
But me you show no wish to entertain;—  
Back to my kindred now I go again!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>All through the
fields I went and tried  
  Hunger with pokeweed to appease.  
I came to you; your love is cold;  
  And your new mate you seek to please.  
Grant that your heart her riches have not won,—  
Her charms are new; my relative's are gone!

</div>
