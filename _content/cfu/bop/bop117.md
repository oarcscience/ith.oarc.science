### <span class="smallcaps">Book X. The Odes of T‘ang</span>

#### I

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsi So;* narrative. The cheerfulness and discretion of the people
of Chin, and their tempered enjoyment at fitting seasons.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The cricket
appears in the hall,  
  And towards its close draws the year.  
Then let us to-day to pleasure give way,  
  Ere the days and months disappear. <span id="page_127">p. 127</span>  
But duty should have our first thought;  
  Indulgence we strictly must bound.  
Take heed lest the joy our reason destroy;—  
  The good man looks out and around.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The cricket
appears in the hall,  
  And the year is fast passing on.  
Then let us to-day to pleasure give way,  
  Ere the days and months shall be gone.  
But some things our care still demand;  
  Against all excess we must guard.  
Take heed lest the joy our reason destroy:  
  The good man thinks no toil too hard.—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The cricket
appears in the hall;  
  The need for our carts is all o’er.  
Then let us to-day to pleasure give way,  
  Ere the days and months be no more.  
But first think of griefs that may come;  
  Between the extremes keep the mean.  
Take heed lest the joy our reason destroy:—  
  The good man is calm and serene.
