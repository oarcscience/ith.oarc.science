<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Tsai Chien;</i> narrative. Appropriate to an occasion when the feudal princes were assisting King Ch&#8216;&ecirc;ng at a sacrifice to King Wu.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">Before their sovereign king the lords appeared,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To seek the rules that he for them ordains. <a name="page_448"><font size="1" color="green">p. 448</font></A><br> Their banners bright with dragon blazonry<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Waved grandly in the air. Upon their reins<br> Rings glittering shone, while on their broidered flags<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And carriage fronts bells gave a tinkling sound.<br> Thus full of majesty, they came to court,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And splendid were their equipages found!</p>  
<p>The king then led them on the left, and laid,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With filial heart, before his father's shrine,<br> His offerings, that long life he might obtain,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And still preserve the honors of his line.<br> Favors he gets, both great and manifold.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Tis from those brilliant and accomplished lords<br> They spring; and there shall long through them descend<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Blessings unmixed and bright that Heaven affords.</div></p>
