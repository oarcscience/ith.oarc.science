<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Pan;</i> narrative. An officer of experience mourns over the prevailing misery; complains of the want of sympathy with him shown by other officers, admonishes them, and sets forth the duty required of them, especially in the angry mood in which it might be supposed that Heaven was.</div></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_2">2</A></FONT></span>Calamities Heaven now is sending down;&#8212;<br> Be not complacent, but the crisis own.<br> Such movements now does angry Heaven produce;&#8212;<br> Be not indifferent and your trust abuse.<br> If in your counsels harmony were found,<br> The people's hearts in union would be bound.<br> If to speak kind and gentle words you chose,<br> How soon would these their restless minds compose!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>You have your duties; mine are not the same.<br> King's servants all,&#8212;such is our common name.<br> I come your comrade, with you to advise,<br> But you resent it, and my words despise.<br> Urgent the matters I would fain submit!<br> O think them not for laughter matters fit!<br> Remember what in days of old they spake:&#8212;<br> "With grass and fuel gatherers counsel take." <a name="page_384"><font size="1" color="green">p. 384</font></A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span>Heaven now regards us with its blackest scowl;&#8212;<br> Boast not yourselves, nor try men to cajole.<br> Good men who see your reason thus o&#8217;ercome,<br> Like those who personate the dead, are dumb.<br> The land with sighs and groans the people fill,<br> Yet we dare not attempt to probe their ill.<br> The wild disorder all their means devours,<br> But they know not one kindly act of ours.</p>
