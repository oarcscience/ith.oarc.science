<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chung Fêng*; metaphorical and allusive. Chuang Chiang bemoans the
supercilious treatment which she received from her husband.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Fierce is the wind
and cold;  
    And such is he.  
Smiling he looks, and bold  
    Speaks mockingly.  
Scornful and lewd his words,  
    Haughty his smile.  
Bound is my heart with cords  
    In sorrow's coil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>As cloud of dust
wind-blown,  
    Just such is he.  
Ready he seems to own,  
    And come to me.  
But he comes not nor goes,  
    Stands in his pride.  
Long, long, with painful throes,  
    Grieved I abide.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Strong blew the
wind; the cloud  
    Hastened away.  
Soon dark again, the shroud  
    Covers the day.  
I wake, and sleep no more  
    Visits my eyes.  
His course I sad deplore,  
    With heavy sighs. <span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Cloudy the sky,
and dark;  
    The thunders roll.  
Such outward signs will mark  
    My troubled soul.  
I wake, and sleep no more  
    Comes to give rest.  
His course I sad deplore,  
    In anguished breast.

</div>
