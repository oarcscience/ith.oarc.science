#### VII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Shih Shu;* metaphorical. Against the oppression and extortion of
the government of Wei.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Large rats, large
rats, let us entreat  
That you our millet will not eat.  
But the large rats we mean are you,  
With whom three years we've had to do,  
And all that time have never known  
One look of kindness on us thrown.  
We take our leave of Wei and you;  
That happier land we long to view.  
O happy land! O happy land!  
There in our proper place we'll stand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Large rats, large
rats, let us entreat  
You'll not devour our crops of wheat.  
But the large rats we mean are you,  
With whom three years we've had to do;  
And all that time you never wrought  
One kindly act to cheer our lot.  
To you and Wei we bid farewell,  
Soon in that happier state to dwell.  
O happy state! O happy state!  
There shall we learn to bless our fate. <span id="page_126">p.
126</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Large rats, large
rats, let us entreat  
Our springing grain you will not eat.  
But the large rats we mean are you,  
With whom three years we've had to do.  
From you there came not all that while  
One word of comfort ’mid our toil.  
We take our leave of you and Wei;  
And to those happier coasts we flee.  
O happy coasts, to you we wend!  
There shall our groans and sorrows end.

</div>
