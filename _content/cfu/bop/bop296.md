#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Fang Lo;* narrative. Seems to be a sequel to the preceding piece.
The young king tells of his difficulties and incompetences; asks for
counsel to help to copy the example of his father; states how he meant
to do so; and concludes with an appeal or prayer to his father.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

At, the beginning of my sway,  
  Counsel I seek to know  
How in my shrinèd father's way  
  My feet may surely go.

Far-reaching were, his life proclaims,  
  The plans of his great mind;  
But how to carry out his aims  
  I fail as yet to find. <span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

When most my powers I shall have tried  
  To reach to his grand height,  
My steps will ever turn aside,  
  Or to the left or right.

I'm but a child, how can I hope  
  Aright my seat to fill,  
Or with the many troubles cope  
  That bode disturbance still?

O excellent and mighty sire,  
  To help thy son now deign!  
With thy high wisdom me inspire,  
  And on thy throne maintain.

To thee, as ever near, I'll try  
  My virtue true to prove.  
In court, in house, before my eye,  
  Thy form shall always move.

</div>
