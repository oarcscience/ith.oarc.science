#### IV

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Yang Chih Shui;* allusive. The troops of Chou, kept on duty in
Shin, murmur at their separation from their families.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>    Fretted the
waters seem,  
    Yet gently flows the stream;—  
Unable a fagot to bear.  
    Guarding Shin here we roam,  
    Wives and children at home,  
All absent our toils who should share. <span id="page_78">p. 78</span>  
    We think of them ever;  
    Thought parts from them never;—  
What month shall we homeward repair?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>    Fretted the
waters seem,  
    Yet gently flows the stream;—  
A bundle of thorns twill not bear.  
    Guarding Fu here we roam,  
    Wives and children at home,  
All absent our toils who should share.  
    We think of them ever;  
    Thought parts from them never;—  
What month shall we homeward repair?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>    Fretted the
waters seem,  
    Yet gently flows the stream;  
The reed bundle powerless to bear.  
    Guarding Hsü here we roam,  
    Wives and children at home,  
All absent our toils who should share.  
    We think of them ever;  
    Thought parts from them never;—  
What month shall we homeward repair?
