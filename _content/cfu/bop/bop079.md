<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>My worthy Chung, I
pray,  
Do not in such a way  
Into my hamlet bound,  
My willow trees to wound.  
For them I do not care,  
But you my parents scare.  
  ’Tis their words I fear.  
    You, Chung, have my heart;  
  But their words severe  
    Will cause me to smart. <span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>My worthy Chung, I
pray,  
Do not in such a way  
Come leaping o’er my wall,  
And make the branches fall  
From my mulberry tree.  
That does not trouble me,  
But my brothers all see.  
  ’Tis their words I fear.  
    You, Chung, have my heart;  
  But their words severe  
    Will cause me to smart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>My worthy Chung, I
pray,  
Do not in such a way  
Into my garden jump,  
My sandal trees to thump.  
For them I do not care,  
But people grow aware  
What ‘tis that brings you there.  
  ’Tis their words I fear.  
    You, Chung, have my heart;  
  But their words severe  
    Will cause me to smart.

</div>
