Textual Heritage

#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hou Jên;* allusive and metaphorical. Lament over the favor shown to
worthless officers at the court of Ts‘ao. And the discountenance of good
men.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Each warden of the
gates appears,  
With lancers and with halberdiers,  
  As well befits his place;  
But these three hundred men, who shine  
Grand in their red knee covers fine,  
  Only the court disgrace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Like pelicans,
upon the dam  
Which stand, and there their pouches cram,  
  Unwet the while their wings,  
Are those who their rich dress display,  
But no befitting service pay,  
  Intent on meanest things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Like pelicans
which eager watch  
Upon the dam, their prey to catch,  
  And spare to wet the beak,  
Are those who richest favors share,  
But take no part in toil or care,  
  Nor the state's welfare seek. <span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Like grass
luxuriant on its side,  
While morning mists the south hill hide,  
  These creatures seem to grow;  
But men of worth, like virtuous maid,  
Lovely but poor, denied wealth's aid,  
  No recognition know.

</div>
