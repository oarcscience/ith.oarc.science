<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hao T‘ien Yu Ch‘êng Ming;* narrative. Appropriate at a sacrifice to
King Ch‘êng.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

The fixed decree of mighty Heaven  
  Had long to Chou assigned the throne,  
Which first to Wên and Wu was given.  
  Ch‘êng next to them as ruler shone. <span id="page_437">p.

Then the foundations of his power  
  Were made by Ch‘êng more deep and sure.  
Through night and day no idle hour  
  He knew,—the reticent and pure.  
His virtue wrought, and glorified  
  The heritage he had obtained;  
Nor were his heart's best powers unplied,  
  Till o’er the land good order reigned.

</div>
