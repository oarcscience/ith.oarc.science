<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Tsê P‘o;* allusive. A gentleman's admiration of and longing for a
certain lady.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>There where its
shores the marsh surround,  
Rushes and lotus plants abound.  
Their loveliness brings to my mind  
The lovelier one that I would find.  
In vain I try to ease the smart  
Of wounded love that wrings my heart.  
In waking thought and likely dreams,  
From every pore the water streams.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>All round the
marsh's shores are seen  
Valerian flowers and rushes green.  
But lovelier is that Beauty rare,  
Handsome and large, and tall, and fair.  
I wish and long to call her mine,  
Doomed with the longing still to pine.  
Nor day nor night e’er brings relief;  
My inmost heart is full of grief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Around the marsh,
in rich display,  
Grow rush and lotus flowers, all gay. <span id="page_159">p.
159</span>  
But not with her do they compare,  
So tall and large, majestic, fair.  
Both day and night, I nothing speed;  
Still clings to me the aching need.  
On side, on back, on face, I lie,  
But vain each change of posture try.

</div>
