*The Book of Poetry*, tr. by James Legge, \[1876\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### IX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chih Ching;* narrative. An ode appropriate in sacrificing to the
kings Wu, Ch‘êng, and K‘ang.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

The arm of Wu was full of might;  
  None could his fire withstand; <span id="page_440">p. 440</span>  
And Ch‘êng and K‘ang stood forth to sight,  
  As kinged by God's own hand.  
We err not when we call then sage.  
  How grandly they maintained  
Their hold of all the heritage  
  That Wên and Wu had gained!  
As here we worship, they descend,  
  While bells and drums resound,  
And stones and lutes their music blend.  
  With blessings we are crowned.  
The rites correctly we discharge;  
  The feast we freely share.  
Those sires Chou's glory will enlarge,  
  And ever for it care.

</div>
