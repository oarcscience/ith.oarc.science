<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ssŭ T‘ieh;* narrative. Celebrating the growing opulence of the
lords of Ch‘in, as seen in their hunting.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Our ruler to the
hunt proceeds;  
And black as iron are his steeds  
That heed the charioteer's command,  
Who holds the six reins in his hand.  
His favorites follow to the chase,  
Rejoicing in his special grace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The season's
males, alarmed, arise,—  
The season's males, of wondrous size.  
Driven by the beaters, forth they spring,  
Soon caught within the hunters’ ring.  
"Drive on their left," the ruler cries;  
And to its mark his arrow flies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The hunting done,
northward he goes;  
And in the park the driver shows  
The horses’ points, and his own skill  
That rules and guides them at his will.  
Light cars, whose teams small bells display,  
The long and short-mouthed dogs convey.

</div>
