#### III

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Tung Shan;* narrative. The duke of Chou tells of the toils of his
soldiers in their expedition to the east and of their return, and their
joy at the last.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>To the hills of
the east we went,  
  And long had we there to remain.  
When the word of recall was sent,  
  Thick and fast came the drizzling rain.  
When told our return we should take,  
  Our hearts in the west were and sore;  
But there did they clothes for us make:—  
  They knew our hard service was o’er. <span id="page_176">p.

On the mulberry grounds in our sight  
  The large caterpillars were creeping;  
Lonely and still we passed the night,  
  All under our carriages sleeping.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>To the hills of
the east we went,  
  And long had we there to remain.  
When the word of recall was sent,  
  Thick and fast came the drizzling rain.  
The heavenly gourds rise to the eye,  
  With their fruit hanging under the eave.  
In our chambers the sowbug we spy;  
  Their webs on our doors spiders weave.  
Our paddocks seem crowded with deer,  
  With the glowworm's light all about.  
Such thoughts, while they filled us with fear,  
  We tried, but in vain, to keep out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>To the hills of
the east we went,  
  And long had we there to remain.  
When the word of recall was sent,  
  Thick and fast came the drizzling rain. <span id="page_177">p.
177</span>  
On ant hills screamed cranes with delight;  
  In their rooms were our wives sighing sore.  
Our homes they had swept and made tight:—  
  All at once we arrived at the door.  
The bitter gourds hanging are seen,  
  From branches of chestnut trees high.  
Three years of toil away we had been,  
  Since such a sight greeted the eye.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>To the hills of
the east we went,  
  And long had we there to remain.  
When the word of recall was sent,  
  Thick and fast came the drizzling rain.  
With its wings now here, and now there,  
  Is the oriole sporting in flight.  
Those brides to their husbands repair,  
  Their steeds red and bay, flecked with white.  
Each mother has fitted each sash;  
  Their equipments are full and complete;  
But fresh unions, whatever their dash,  
  Can ne’er with reunions compete.
