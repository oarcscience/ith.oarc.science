#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Wu Yang;* narrative. Supposed to celebrate the largeness and
condition of King Hsüan's flocks and herds; with an auspice of the
prosperity of the kingdom.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  Who dares to say
your sheep are few?  
    The flocks are all three hundred strong.  
  Who dares despise your cattle too?  
    *There* ninety, black-lipped, press along. <span id="page_234">p.
234</span>  
Though horned the sheep, yet peaceful each appears;  
The cattle come, with moist and flapping ears.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  These climb the
heights, those drink the pool;  
    Some lie at rest, while others roam.  
  With raincoats, and thin splint hats cool,  
    And bearing food, your herdsmen come.  
In thirties, ranged by hues, the creatures stand;  
Fit victims they will yield at your command.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  Your herdsmen
twigs and fagots bring,  
    With prey of birds and beasts for food.  
  Your sheep, untouched by evil thing,  
    Approach, their health and vigor good.  
The herdsman's waving hand they all behold,  
And docile come, and pass into the fold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>  Your herdsmen
dream;—fish take the place  
    Of men; on banners falcons fly, <span id="page_235">p. 235</span>  
  Displacing snakes and tortoises.  
    The augur tells his prophecy:—  
"The first betoken plenteous years; the change  
Of banners shows of homes a widening range."

</div>
