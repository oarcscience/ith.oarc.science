#### XI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ko Shêng;* allusive and narrative. A wife mourns the death of her
husband, refusing to be comforted, and will cherish his memory till her
own death.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>The dolichos over
the thorn tree grows;  
Its shoots o’er the waste the convolvulus throws:—  
  Thus finds its proper aid each plant.  
He whom I loved, my husband, from me gone,  
I sadly mourn my lot, and dwell alone,  
  Doomed thus my heart's support to want.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The dolichos
twines round the jujube tree;  
The tombs with convolvulus covered we see:—  
  Each plant thrives in its proper place  
He whom I loved, the husband of my heart,  
Is here no more, and I remain apart,  
  Nor can my life's strength now embrace. <span id="page_137">p.
137</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Bright in our room
was the pillow of horn,  
And coverlet broidered the couch to adorn,  
  When first in one was blent our fate.  
The husband of my heart, whom I admired,  
Is here no more, and I must live retired,  
  And for each morning lonely wait.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Each day a day of
the long summer light,  
Each night as long as the dark winter night;—  
  Shall I in solitude here pine.  
A hundred years will seem their course to run  
Ere of this mortal life the time is done,  
  And him within the tomb I join.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Each night as long
as the dark winter night,  
Each day a day of the long summer light;—  
  To me no comfort e’er will come.  
My life will seem to last a hundred years,  
Till in my death its welcome close appears,  
  And to his chamber I go home.

</div>
