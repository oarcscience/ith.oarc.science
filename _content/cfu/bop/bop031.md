#### III

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Yen Yen*; allusive and narrative. Chuang Chiang relates her grief
at the departure of Tai Kuei, and celebrates that lady's virtue.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>With wings, not
level, spread,  
  About the swallows stir.  
Homeward the lady sped,  
  And I escorted her.  
And when away from sight she passed,  
Like rain, my tears came falling fast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The swallows fly
about,  
  Now up, now down, they dart.  
She to her home set out,  
  And I was loth to part.  
Her form when distance from me kept,  
Long time I stood, and silent wept. <span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Above, beneath,
then cry  
  The flying swallows vent.  
Homeward she passed, and I  
  Far with her southwards went.  
Her form when distance from me bore  
With bitter grief my heart was sore.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>This lady Chung
loved me  
  With feeling true and deep.  
Docile and good was she,  
  Nor failed the light to keep.  
Unworthy me her deed and word  
Taught to respect our former lord.

</div>
