<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Yu Ku;</i> narrative. The blind musicians of Chou; the instruments of music; and their harmony. Prepared probably for the occasion of the duke of Chou's completing his instruments of music, and announcing the fact at a grand performance in the temple of King W&ecirc;n.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">See the blind musicians here!<br> Sightless all, the men appear, <a name="page_445"><font size="1" color="green">p. 445</font></A><br> In the temple court of Chou.<br> All is ready for them now.</p>  
<p>Stand the music frames around,<br> On whose posts rich plumes abound,<br> While their face boards, edged like teeth,<br> Show the drums that hang beneath.<br> Sounding stones and hand drums there<br> In the concert part shall bear.<br> See the <i>chu</i> to signalize<br> When the music shall arise;<br> And the <i>y&uuml;</i>, whose harsher note<br> Hushes instrument and throat.</p>  
<p>When the duke has thus prepared,<br> Soon the various notes are heard.<br> Organ's swell and flutes&#8217; soft voice<br> Make the listening ears rejoice.</p>  
<p>Sweet the harmony of sound,<br> Holding all in rapture bound!<br> When such music shall be made,<br> Then our sires for whom &#8216;tis played,<br> And the visitors who come,<br> Welcomed to this sacred home,<br> Shall desire it to last long,<br> Thrilled with the melodious song.</div></p>
