Textual Heritage

#### XIII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chien Hsi;* narrative and allusive. Half in scorn, half in sorrow,
an officer of Wei tells of the mean services in which he was employed.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>With mind
indifferent, things I easy take.  
In every dance I prompt appearance make:—  
Then, when the sun is at his topmost height;  
There, in the place that courts the public sight. <span id="page_41">p.
41</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>With figure large
I in the courtyard dance.  
And the duke smiles, when he beholds me prance.  
A tiger's strength I have; the steeds swift bound;  
The reins as ribbons in my hands are found.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>See how I hold the
flute in my left hand;  
In right the pheasant's plume, waved like a wand;  
With visage red, where rouge you think to trace,  
While the duke pleased, sends down the cup of grace!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Hazels on hills;
the *ling* in meadow damp;—  
Each has its place, while I'm a slighted scamp.  
My thoughts go back to th’ early days of Chou,  
And muse upon its chiefs, not equaled now.  
O noble chiefs, who then the west adorned,  
Would ye have thus neglected me and scorned?

</div>
