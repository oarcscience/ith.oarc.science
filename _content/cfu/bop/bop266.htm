<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Sang Jou;</i> metaphorical, narrative, and allusive. The earl of Jui mourns over the disorder and misery of the times, with a view to reprehend the misgovernment of King Li,&#8212;especially his oppressions and listening to bad counselors.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1">1</A></FONT></span>See the luxuriant mulberry tree,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That threw far round its leafy shade,<br> Now by rude hands&#8212;sad sight to see!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Stript of its leaves, a ruin made.<br> So on our multitudes descends<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Oppression's fierce and ruthless hand.<br> My heart beneath its sorrow bends.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Great Heaven, take pity on the land!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_2">2</A></FONT></span>Eager and strong, the war steeds prance;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Falcon and other banners fly.<br> Bristles the land with spear and lance;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Wasted and peeled our regions lie.<br> Disorder grows, and peace is fled; .<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the black-haired race of yore?<br> Beneath the sky with ruin red<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Chou's kingdom sinks to rise no more. <a name="page_397"><font size="1" color="green">p. 397</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>Who can arrest the march of fate?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven nurtures not, but glows with ire.<br> No town presents a sheltering gate;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where can our hurrying feet retire?<br> When good men, sons of peace, bear sway,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They smooth and knit the social state.<br> They are not here;&#8212;who paved the way<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For those through whom come strife and hate?</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_4">4</A></FONT></span>Sore anguish dwells within my heart;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I brood upon the country's woes.<br> Why was I born to have my part<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Now when great Heaven its anger shows?<br> Throughout our coasts, from east to west,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;No quiet resting place is found.<br> I wander, desolate, distressed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And troubles rave our borders round.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span>You plan, O king, and caution use?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! growing ills, dismembered land! <a name="page_398"><font size="1" color="green">p. 398</font></A><br> Your great concern should be to choose<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The best, around your throne to stand.<br> Be this your way! What burns and glows,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ere used, you in the water cool.<br> How can your methods bring repose?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ruin awaits you, and your rule.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_6">6</A></FONT></span>One struggles on against the wind,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With breathless effort,&#8212;all in vain.<br> So they who fain would serve thee find<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A baffling force, and little gain.<br> They till the fields who might have shone<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;High in official rank and power;<br> For now, ambition's impulse gone,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They sow and reap, and seek no more.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_7">7</A></FONT></span>Heaven thus inflicts death and unrest;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! we see a kingless throne!<br> And still there comes the insect pest,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And farmers&#8217; hopes are overthrown. <a name="page_399"><font size="1" color="green">p. 399</font></A><br> Woe! woe to our great central land!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For all in peril heaves my sigh.<br> Bereft of strength, I sadly stand,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And silent view the vault on high.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_8">8</A></FONT></span>See here a ruler, firm and good,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whom chiefs and people all revere!<br> He keeps his heart; his plans are shrewd;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He seeks for helpers far and near.<br> See there one of a different kind,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who thinks none but himself is wise!<br> Within his narrow range confined,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His actions only cause surprise.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_9">9</A></FONT></span>Lo! &#8217;mongst the trees, the herds of deer<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In concord roam throughout the wood.<br> With us all friends are insincere;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;None cultivate the faithful mood.<br> "Advance! Retreat!" thus people say;<br> "There's equal danger either way." <a name="page_400"><font size="1" color="green">p. 400</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_10">10</A></FONT></span>Here is a sage! His views and speech<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Go far beyond the present time.<br> There is a fool! With narrow reach,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His smallest thoughts he counts sublime.<br> All this before I could have told.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! why did fear my tongue withhold?</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_11">11</A></FONT></span>The good man see! His way is barred;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He pines unused, or dwells unsought.<br> See now the man whose heart is hard!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He's courted, and to honor brought.<br> Such government disorder breeds;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The people haste to evil deeds.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_12">12</A></FONT></span>From the large valleys come the winds;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;There they collect, and thence they blow.<br> And thus the virtuous man one finds<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Doing what's good;&#8212;he must act so.<br> But he, whose nature scorns the right,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His nature vile, &#8217;gainst good will fight.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_13">13</A></FONT></span>By force of nature blows the wind;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;So men of greed will strive for pelf.<br> Would he but hear, I'd speak my mind;&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As drunk, I mutter to myself. <a name="page_401"><font size="1" color="green">p. 401</font></A><br> He will not use the good; and I<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Deplore his course with moan and sigh.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_14">14</A></FONT></span>Ah! friends, these lines, I know full well,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Will only wake your angry thought;<br> But random shot may sometimes tell,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And bird on wing be hit and caught.<br> Your good, and that alone, I seek,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Howe&#8217;er your anger you may wreak.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_15">15</A></FONT></span>Those hypocrites, adepts in lies,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Produce the chaos of the land.<br> The more one's weak, the more he plies<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever strength he can command.<br> The people hopelessly perverse!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Tis their vile work has wrought this curse.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_16">16</A></FONT></span>The people show unrest, because<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Those artful villains on them prey.<br> They listen to you with applause;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Behind your back what's bad they say.<br> Ah! friends, these charges you deny.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;My song is true! It does not lie.</div></p>
