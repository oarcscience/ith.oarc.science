#### VII

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Yü Tsao;* allusive. Praise of the king by the princes at some
feast:—his quiet happiness in Hao.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Fishes there among
the pondweed lie;  
From the bank their large heads we espy;—  
       Fishes could not happier be. <span id="page_308">p. 308</span>  
Here in Hao resides our lord, the king;  
To him joy his festive pleasures bring.  
       Happy and at ease is he.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Fishes there among
the pondweed glide;  
From the bank their long tails are descried;—  
       Fishes could not happier be.  
Here in Hao resides the king, our lord;  
Festive pleasures joy to him afford.  
       Happy and at ease is he.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Fishes there among
the pondweed live,  
Shelter to them where the rushes give;—  
       Fishes could not happier be.  
Here in Hao the king, our lord, resides;  
Safe and tranquil ever here he bides.  
       Happy and at ease is he.

</div>
