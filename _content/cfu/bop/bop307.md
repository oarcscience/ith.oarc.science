#### II

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Yu Pi;* allusive. The happy intercourse of some marquis of Lu with
his ministers and officers;—how they deliberated on business, feasted
together, and the ministers and officers expressed their good wishes.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>How sleek and
strong, how sleek and strong,  
Those chestnut teams that dash along!  
Early to court they bring, and late,  
Their masters, ministers of state,  
In council wise, quick in debate.  
As flock of egrets, circling round  
Aloft, then lighting on the ground,  
Those masters are. The drums resound; <span id="page_465">p.
465</span>  
Having well drunk, they rise and dance,  
And thus their mutual joy enhance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>How sleek and
strong, how sleek and strong,  
Those stallion teams that dash along!  
Early and late their masters all  
Are present in the palace hall,  
And with the duke a-drinking fall.  
As flock of egrets, circling round  
Aloft, or wheeling ’bove the ground,  
Are they. Anon the drums resound;  
Having well drunk, they homeward move;  
Pure is the mutual joy they prove.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>How sleek and
strong, how sleek and strong,  
Those iron grays that dash along!  
Early and late, their masters all  
Are present in the palace hall,  
And with the duke a-feasting fall.  
At last their prayer they thus express:—  
"May fruitful years our marquis bless!  
His goodness may he still maintain,  
And leave to sons in lengthening chain!"  
May such rejoicing long remain!

</div>
