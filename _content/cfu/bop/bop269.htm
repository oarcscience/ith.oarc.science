<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ch&ecirc;ng Min;</i> narrative. Celebrating the virtues of Chung Shan-fu, who appears to have been one of the principal ministers of King Hs&uuml;an, and his dispatch to the east, to fortify the capital of the state of Ch&#8216;i.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1">1</A></FONT></span>Heaven made the race of men, designed<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With nature good and large;<br> Functions of body, powers of mind,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Their duties to discharge.<br> All men this normal nature own,<br> Its normal virtue all men crown<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With love sincere and true.<br> Heaven by our sovereign's course was moved, <a name="page_412"><font size="1" color="green">p. 412</font></A><br> And to aid him, its son approved,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Gave birth to Chung Shan-fu.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_2">2</A></FONT></span>Mild and admired, this chief displays<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Virtues that win the heart.<br> His air and looks a wondrous grace<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To all his ways impart.<br> His rule of life the ancient law,<br> To bear himself unmarred by flaw<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With earnest mind he aims.<br> In sympathy with our great Head,<br> Abroad the royal will to spread<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His constant service claims.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>The king gave charge to Chung Shan-fu:&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hear now what I direct.<br> As served your fathers, so serve you,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And me, your king, protect.<br> Let all my lords your pattern see;<br> Publish among them each decree;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Speak freely in my stead.<br> Of what goes on inform my mind. <a name="page_413"><font size="1" color="green">p. 413</font></A><br> Through you let all my measures find<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Obedience promptly paid."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_4">4</A></FONT></span>Great was the charge.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span>Among the people flies the word:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"What's soft men swallow fast;<br> And what is for the teeth too hard<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Out of their mouths they cast."<br> But never yet did mortal trace<br> In Chung Shan such ignoble case;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor soft nor hard he knows.<br> The strong and fierce he does not dread;<br> And on the poor or widowed head<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Insult he never throws. <a name="page_414"><font size="1" color="green">p. 414</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_6">6</A></FONT></span>Again the people often say:&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"Virtue is very light?<br> Light as a hair; yet few can bear<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of its weight."<br> &#8217;Tis so; but Chung Shan, as I think,<br> Needs not from virtue's weight to shrink,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That other men defies.<br> Aid from my love his strength rejects.<br> If the king's measures have defects,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;What's needed he supplies.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_7">7</A></FONT></span>He asks the spirit of the path<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His blessing to send down.<br> His steeds are strong; each soldier hath<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A bravery like his own.<br> Eastward they march; his charge is there.<br> That city's bulwarks to repair,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How ardently he hies!<br> List to the tinkling of his bells!<br> Of his steeds' constant tramp it tells;&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The walls will soon arise. <a name="page_415"><font size="1" color="green">p. 415</font></A></p>
