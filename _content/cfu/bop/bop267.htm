<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Y&uuml;n Han;</i> narrative. King Hs&uuml;an, on occasion of a great drought, expostulates with God and all the spirits, who might be expected to assist him and his people, asks them wherefore they were contending with him, and details the measures he had taken, and was still taking, for the removal of the calamity.</div></p>

Around,<br> No hope, no comfort, can be found.<br> The dukes and ministers of old<br> Give us no help.
