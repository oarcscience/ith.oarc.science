<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Where the palaces
rose grand,  
When Chou nobly ruled the land,  
Millets, some with drooping head,  
Some, just coming into blade,  
All around abundant grew.  
Slow the fields I wandered through,  
Moved in heart such sight to view.  
Friends who knew me understood.  
What induced my saddened mood.  
Those who did not know me said,  
There I search for something made.  
O thou azure Heaven, remote,  
Who this desolation wrought?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Where the palaces
rose grand,  
When Chou nobly ruled the land,  
Millets, drooping, heavy here,  
There just coming into ear,  
All around abundant grew. <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>  
Slow the fields I wandered through,  
Drunk with grief such sights to view.  
Friends who knew me understood  
What induced my saddened mood.  
Those who did not know me said,  
There I search for something made.  
O thou azure Heaven, remote,  
Who this desolation wrought?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Where the palaces
rose grand,  
When Chou nobly ruled the land,  
Millets, heavy, drooping low,  
Some the bursting grain that show,  
All around abundant grew.  
Slow the fields I wandered through,  
Breath nigh stopt such scene to view.  
Friends who knew me understood  
What induced my saddened mood.  
Those who did not know me said,  
There I search for something made.  
O thou azure Heaven, remote,  
Who this desolation wrought?
