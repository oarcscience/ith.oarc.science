<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>On the moor, where
thickly grew  
Creeping grass, bent down with dew,  
There a handsome man drew nigh,  
’Neath whose forehead, broad and high,  
Gleamed his clear and piercing eye.  
’Twas by accident we met;  
Glad was I my wish to get. <span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Where the grass
creeps o’er the moor,  
With the dew all covered o’er,  
There the finest man found I,  
’Bove whose clear and piercing eye,  
Rose his forehead, broad and high.  
Chance gave us a meeting rare,  
And we both were happy there.

</div>
