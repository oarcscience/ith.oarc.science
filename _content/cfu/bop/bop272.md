#### IX

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chang Wu;* narrative. Celebrating an expedition of king Hsüan
against the more northern tribes of the Huai,—its imposing progress and
complete success.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Nan Chung's
descendant, Huang the Great,  
  Grand master, now draws near  
Before the king, and to him straight  
  The king's charge, loud and clear, <span id="page_424">p. 424</span>  
Comes thus:—"My armies six forth call;  
  What war requires make ready all;—  
South we our course direct.  
  Your duties reverently fulfill,  
And wary be lest our good will  
  Those southern states reject."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Next to the chief
of Yin ’twas said:—  
  "Charge Hsiu-fu, earl of Ch‘êng,  
The ranks to range, and warning dread  
  Make through the host to ring.  
Our march along the Huai's bank lies;  
  Against Hsü must our enterprise  
Rapid and sure be made.  
  Delay we brook not, nor to hold  
The land we take, lest the threefold  
  Work in the fields be stayed."

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>The son of Heaven
calm, trustful was,  
  Majestic in his strength.  
His troops advanced, no crowded mass,  
  Nor lines of broken length. <span id="page_425">p. 425</span>  
From stage to stage, as on they went,  
  The land of Hsü with terror rent,  
Its people all unmanned.  
  As when men hear the thunder's roll,  
Or sudden crash, and quake in soul,  
  So now shook all the land.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>The king aroused
his martial might,  
  As he were moved with rage.  
His tiger chiefs he sent to fight;  
  And eager to engage  
Well named were they! Along Huai's banks  
  Soon grandly moved the royal ranks.  
A captive crowd was held.  
  Securely kept the country round,  
No rebel hosts a passage found,  
  Succor to Hsü to yield.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Numerous the
legions, moving fleet,  
  As if on wings they flew;  
Grand as the Chiang and Han, when meet  
  Their mingled streams the view. <span id="page_426">p. 426</span>  
Solid as mountain mass they seemed,  
  And brightly as the river gleamed,  
Whose waters ceaseless rush.  
  Continuous, in order sure,  
Inscrutable, success secure,  
  They marched revolt to crush.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>The king's plans
truthful and sincere,  
  Hsü's tribes at once sought peace.  
Its chiefs assembled all; their prayer  
  Was for the royal grace.  
And quickly by the son of Heaven  
  Was order to the country given;  
In solemn court he shone.  
  Before him came the chiefs, and swore  
That they would break their faith no more.  
  "The war," he said, "is done."
