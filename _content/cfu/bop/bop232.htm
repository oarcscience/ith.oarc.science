<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chio Kung;</i> allusive, narrative, and metaphorical. Against the king's cold treatment of his relatives by consanguinity and affinity; the extensive and baneful influence of his example; the encouragement given by him to calumniators.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1">1</A></FONT></span>Whene&#8217;er we strongly bend a bow,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both string and ends we near us bring;<br> And when we let the tension go,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;From us with quick recoil they spring.<br> So when we show affection deep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Our kith and kin to us we draw;<br> But when from them aloof we keep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They shrink from us by nature's law.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_2">2</A></FONT></span>When you, O king, to kin are cold,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Such coldness rules throughout the land.<br> You for their teacher all men hold;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To learn your ways needs no command.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>Brethren whose virtue stands the test,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;By bad example still unchanged,<br> Their generous feelings manifest,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor grow among themselves estranged.<br> But if their virtue weakly fails<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The evil influence to withstand,<br> Then selfishness o&#8217;er love prevails,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And troubles rise on every hand. <a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="green">p. 313</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_4">4</A></FONT></span>When men in disputations fine<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To hear their consciences refuse,<br> Then &#8217;gainst each other they repine,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And each maintains his special views.<br> If one a place of rank obtain,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And scorn humility to show,<br> The others view him with disdain,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And, wrangling, all to ruin go.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span>A colt the old horse deems himself,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And vainly hastens to the race;<br> So thinks the mean man, bent on pelf,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Himself fit for the highest place:<br> Stuffed to the full, he still shall feed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor own that he has had enough.<br> He drinks, and with insatiate greed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Knows not the time for leaving off.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_6">6</A></FONT></span>The monkeys by their nature know<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The way to climb a tree, untaught.<br> We need no mud on him to throw,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whom lying in the mud we've caught.<br> The nature of all meaner men<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Leads them to follow and obey.<br> Nor right, nor wrong the millions ken,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But imitate the sovereign's way.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_7">7</A></FONT></span>The snow falls fast, and all the ground<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hides with its masses, white and clear;<br> But when the sunbeams play around,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;It soon will melt and disappear. <a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></A><br> This fact, O king, you don't perceive;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Those men who calumnies diffuse,<br> Not heeding, to themselves you leave,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And your indulgence they abuse.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_8">8</A></FONT></span>Yes, though the snow lie drifted deep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Away before the heat &#8217;twill flow.<br> I for the king's neglect must weep;&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like Man or Mao those men will grow.</div></p>
