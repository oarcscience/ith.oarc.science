<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Yü Li;* allusive and narrative. An ode used at district
entertainments, celebrating the abundance of everything, and the
prosperity of the times.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>By means of
simplest fish trap that men make,  
Sand blowers small and yellow jaws they take;—  
  Such the result good rule insures.  
And here our host his spirits forth has set,  
Good and abundant; proof we now are met,  
  When ordered rule large wealth secures. <span id="page_204">p.
204</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>In simplest fish
traps that might useless seem,  
They take abundant store of tench and bream;—  
  Such issue from our good rule springs.  
And here our host his spirits forth has set,  
Abundant, good;—sure proof we now are met,  
  When ordered rule great riches brings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Into the simplest
fish traps largely go  
Mudfish and carp;—captures that clearly show  
  How with good rule the land is crowned.  
And here our host his spirits forth has set,  
Good and most ample;—proof we here are met,  
  When ordered rule makes wealth abound.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>The mats in great
abundance viands show;  
And these of rarest quality we know.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>The viands
excellent are here revealed;  
Both land and sea their contributions yield.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Viands in ample
store the feast displays;  
And all in season, all beyond our praise.
