### <span class="smallcaps">Book III. The Sacrificial Odes of Shang</span>

#### I

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Na;* narrative. Appropriate to a sacrifice to Tang the Successful,
the real founder of the Shang dynasty,—dwelling especially on the music,
and on the reverence with which the service was performed.

O grand! the drums, both large and for the hand,  
Complete in number, here in order stand.  
Their tones, though loud, harmoniously are blent,  
And rise to greet our ancestor's descent.

Him, the great T‘ang, of merit vast, our king  
Asks by this music to descend, and bring  
To us, the worshipers, the soothing sense  
That he, the object of desire intense,  
Is here. Deep are the sounds the drums emit,  
And now we hear the flutes, which shrilly fit  
Into the diapason:—concord great,  
Which the sonorous gem doth regulate!  
Majestic is our king of T‘ang's great line,  
Whose instruments such qualities combine. <span id="page_479">p.
479</span>

Large bells we hear, which with the drums have place,  
While in the court the dancers move with grace.  
Scions of ancient kings the service view,  
Pleased and delighted, guests of goodness true.  
Such service we received from former days,  
Down from our sires, who showed us virtue's ways,—  
How to be meek and mild, from morn to night,  
And reverently discharge our parts aright.

May T‘ang accept the rites his son thus pays,  
As round the summer comes, and autumn days!

</div>
