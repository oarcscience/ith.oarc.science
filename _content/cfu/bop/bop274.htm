<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chao Min;</i> narrative, all but Stanza 6, which is metaphorical. The writer bemoans the misery and ruin which were going on, and shows how they were owing to the king's employment of mean and worthless characters.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1">1</A></FONT></span>O pitying Heaven, why see we thee<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In terrors thus arrayed?<br> Famine has come. The people flee,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And homeless roam, dismayed.<br> In settled spots, and far and near,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Our regions all lie waste and drear.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_2">2</A></FONT></span>See o&#8217;er the land Heaven's net of crime!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! in place appear<br> Men idle, knowing not the time,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Locusts looked at with fear,<br> Oppressive, perverse, fond of strife!&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Can such as these bring peace and life?</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>Slanderers and insolent, the king<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet sees in them no ill.<br> Us to dread peril's brink they bring;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Our minds with care they fill. <a name="page_431"><font size="1" color="green">p. 431</font></A><br> Not for a moment dare we rest,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Degraded oft, and sore opprest.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_4">4</A></FONT></span>As when the dry parched grass we see<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Wither for want of rain;<br> As water plants graft on a tree<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot their life retain;<br> So all things now to ruin haste.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who can their fatal course arrest?</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span>&#8217;Twas merit once that riches gained;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The case how different now!<br> Troubles through all our time have reigned,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And greater still they grow.<br> Like grain unhulled those men in place!<br> Like fine rice these who find no grace!<br> Ye villains, of yourselves retire!<br> Why thus prolong my grief and ire?</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_6">6</A></FONT></span>Now empty stands and dry the pool;&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;No streams into it flow.<br> The spring is idle, once so full;&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Unfed now from below!<br> So for those evils all around<br> Sufficient causes could be found; <a name="page_432"><font size="1" color="green">p. 432</font></A><br> But they increase my anxious care,<br> Lest I be caught in evil snare.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_7">7</A></FONT></span>When our first kings the throne received,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Such ministers they had<br> As Chao's great chief, whom all believed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In one day he would add<br> A thousand li, from states which came<br> Our king's protecting care to claim.<br> Now in one day that space is lost!<br> Can none the ancient virtue boast?</div></p>
