#### V

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Han Lu;* allusive and narrative. In praise of the virtue of King
Wan, blessed by his ancestors, and raised to the highest dignity without
seeking of his own.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Round the foot of
Mount Han  
    Grow the hazel and thorn.  
Self-possession and ease  
    Did our monarch adorn.  
Striving for his height of place,  
These around him threw their grace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>From the large cup
of jade  
    Fragrant spirits down flow.  
Self-possession and ease  
    Did our prince ever show.  
Could there but on him descend  
Rank and blessing without end? <span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  Up to heaven
flies the hawk;  
    Fishes spring in the deep.  
  Self-possession and ease  
    Did our prince ever keep.  
Grand the influence he shed,  
As those virtues he displayed!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>  In the vessel
behold  
    How his spirits shine clear!  
  The red bull is ready,  
    Nor the knife views with fear.  
Thus he paid the sacred rite,  
Brighter blessing to invite!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>  Oaks and shrubs
thickly grow,  
    Which for firewood men hew.  
  Self-possession and ease  
    In our prince all could view.  
Spirits cheered him in his course,  
Nerving him with secret force.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>  How the creepers
close twine  
    Round the branches and stems!  
  Self-possession and ease  
    Robed our prince as with gems.  
Happiness increased unsought,  
Nor by crooked ways was bought.

</div>
