#### III

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chu Miao;* allusive and narrative. Celebrating the service of the
earl of Shao in building the city of Seay, and the cheerful alacrity of
his soldiers under his management.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>As the young
millet, by the genial rain  
  Enriched, shoots up luxuriant and tall,  
So, when we southward marched with toil and pain,  
  The earl of Shao cheered and inspired us all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>We pushed our
barrows, and our burdens bore;  
  We drove our wagons, and our oxen led.  
"The work once done, our labor there is o’er,  
  And home we travel," to ourselves we said. <span id="page_320">p.
320</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Close kept our
footmen round the chariot track;  
  Our eager host in close battalions sped.  
"When once our work is done, then we go back,  
  Our labor over," to themselves they said.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Hard was the work
we had at Seay to do,  
  But Shao's great earl the city soon upreared  
The host its service gave with ardor true;—  
  Such power in all the earl's commands appeared!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>We did on plains
and low lands what was meet;  
  We cleared the springs and streams, the land to drain.  
The earl of Shao announced his work complete,  
  And the king's heart reposed, at rest again.
