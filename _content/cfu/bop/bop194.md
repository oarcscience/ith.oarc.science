### <span class="smallcaps">Book IV. The Decade of Ch‘i Fu</span>

#### I

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Ch‘i Fu;* narrative. The soldiers of the royal guard complain of
the service imposed on them by the minister of war.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Hear, minister of
war, the charge we bring!  
We are the teeth and talons of the king;  
  Close to his person is our place.  
Why have you sent us to this homeless life,  
Where far from court we roam, ’mid miseries rife?  
  Why are we doomed to this disgrace? <span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Hear, minister of
war, the accusing word!  
We are the taloned soldiers of our lord,  
  And near his person should have rest.  
But you from court have sent us far away,  
Where ceaselessly we toil from day to day,  
  By constant misery oppressed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Hear, minister of
war, whose erring deed  
Has paid our valor with a sorry meed,  
  When we should near the court reside.  
Why have you sent us far to suffer grief,  
And leave our mothers longing for relief,  
  With all their cooking labors tried?

</div>
