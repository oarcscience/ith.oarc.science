#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Huan Lan;* allusive. Picture of a conceited young man of rank.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Feeble as branch
of sparrow gourd, this youth,  
Wears spike at girdle, as if he, forsooth,  
Were quite a man; but though the spike he wears,  
He knows not us at whom he proudly stares.  
How easy and conceited is his mien!  
How drop his girdle ends, full jaunty seen!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Like leaf of
sparrow gourd, that coxcomb young,  
With archer's thimble at his girdle hung!  
He wears the thimble, but he's not the swell  
To lord it over us who know him well.  
How easy and conceited is his mien!  
How drop his girdle ends, full jaunty seen!

</div>
