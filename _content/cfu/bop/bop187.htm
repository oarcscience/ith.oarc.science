His car four piebalds drew,<br> That moved like one great steed to human view.<br> A royal gift, it shone in glittering red,<br> With bamboo-checkered screen, and quiver made<br> Of sealskin strong. The gilt hooks we could tell<br> On each steed's breast; the rein ends graceful fell.</p>

The battle raged,<br> While the drums rolled, inspiring all engaged.<br> Victory once gained, a lighter sound they gave,<br> The while he ordered back the victors brave.</p>
