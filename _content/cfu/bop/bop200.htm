<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chieh Nan Shan;</i> allusive and narrative. A lamentation over the miserable state of the kingdom, denouncing the injustice and carelessness of Grand Master Yin as the cause of it, and the conduct of the king.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1">1</A></FONT></span>That southern hill, sublime, uprears its craggy height;<br> Such thou, Grand Master Yin, before the nation's sight!<br> Burning with inward grief, none name thee even in jest;<br> Ruin impends, but thou delay&#8217;st the needed quest. <a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="green">p. 236</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_2">2</A></FONT></span>Sublime that southern hill, with vegetation grand!<br> More awful thou, great Yin, whom as unjust we brand.<br> With pestilence and death, Heaven aids disorder's sway;<br> A silent nation frowns;&#8212;<i>thou</i> changest not thy way!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>On Yin our Chou depends. By justice he should bind<br> Our many states in one, with no disloyal mind,<br> And guide the people right, thus helpful to the king.<br> O cruel Heaven, that he such woes on all should bring!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_4">4</A></FONT></span>In him, himself inert, the people put no trust.<br> He, treacherous, from place and council keeps the just. <a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="green">p. 237</font></A><br> Mean men, unfairly screened, the common weal destroy,<br> And his vile relatives the highest posts enjoy.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span>Great Heaven, unjust, the land exhausts with all these pains.<br> Great Heaven, unkind, these woes upon it ceaseless rains.<br> Oh! were the good in power, men's hearts would be at peace!<br> And &#8217;neath impartial rule, our wranglings soon would cease.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_6">6</A></FONT></span>O great unpitying Heaven, our troubles have no close!<br> With every month they grow; men's minds know no repose.<br> My heart with grief is drunk. What weak hand holds the reins? <a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="green">p. 238</font></A><br> &#8217;Tis Yin's supineness that augments the people's pains.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_7">7</A></FONT></span>I yoke my steeds long-necked, and through the land I hie.<br> From the distress on every side vain the attempt to fly!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_8">8</A></FONT></span>Here evil rampant bares the spear;&#8212;they fight with rage,<br> Then pacified and friends, in revel they engage.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_9">9</A></FONT></span>This is from Heaven unjust. Our king has no repose.<br> Infatuate Yin rejects all counselors as foes.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_10">10</A></FONT></span>This song by me, Chia-fu, the king's sad case relates.<br> Would he but change his heart, and nurse the myriad states!</div></p>
