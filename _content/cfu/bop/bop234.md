### <span class="smallcaps">Book VIII. The Decade of Tu Jên Shih</span>

#### I

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Tu Jên Shih;* narrative. Praise of the ladies and gentlemen of a
former time for the simplicity of their dress, the correctness of their
deportment, and the elegance of their manners.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>In the old capital
they stood,  
  With yellow fox furs plain,  
Their manners all correct and good,  
  Speech free from vulgar stain.  
Could we go back to Chow's old days,  
  All would look up to them with praise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>In the old capital
they wore  
  *T‘ai* hats and black caps small;  
And ladies, who famed surnames bore,  
  Their own thick hair let fall.  
Such simple ways are seen no more,  
And the changed manners I deplore. <span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Ear stoppers, made
of sew stones fine,  
  In the old days were worn.  
Each lady of a noble line  
  A Yin or Chi seemed born.  
Such officers and ladies now  
I see not, and my sorrows grow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>With graceful
sweep their girdles fell,  
  Then in the days of old.  
The ladies’ side hair, with a swell,  
  Like scorpion's tail, rose bold.  
Such, if I saw them in these days,  
I'd follow with admiring gaze.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>So hung their
girdles, not for show;—  
  To their own length ’twas due.  
’Twas not by art the hair curled so;—  
  By nature so it grew.  
I seek such manners now in vain,  
And pine for them with longing pain.
