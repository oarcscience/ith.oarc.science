<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Fitness for war,
’mid peace, we here acquire,  
Around the Lo, whose waters, broad and deep,  
Flow swiftly on. Eastward our king has come,  
Of happiness and dignities the fount.  
His red knee covers, madder-dyed, shine bright;—  
So his six hosts to battle he would lead.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Fitness for war,
’mid peace, we here acquire,  
Around the Lo, whose waters, broad and deep,  
Flow swiftly on. Eastward our king has come,  
With gems far gleaming round his scabbard's mouth.  
Long may he live;—for myriads of years,  
And still maintain the fortunes of his house!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Fitness for war,
’mid peace, we here acquire,  
Around the Lo, whose waters, broad and deep  
Flow swiftly on. Eastward our king has come,  
Happy, and of all dignities possessed.  
Long may he live;—for myriads of years,  
Preserving safe his many clans and states!
