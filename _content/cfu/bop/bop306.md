<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1  ">1  </span></span>On the wide
plains, our frontiers near,  
  The stallions, sleek and large, appear.  
  There, sleek and large, they meet our sight;  
  Some black, with their hind quarters white;  
  Pale yellow, some; some black; some bay:—  
  For carriage teams good horses they! <span id="page_463">p.
463</span>  
To the duke's thoughts we can assign no bound;  
Turned to his steeds, lo! thus good are they found!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  On the wide
plains, our frontiers near,  
  The stallions, sleek and large, appear.  
  Those stallions, sleek and large, are seen;  
  Some piebald,—white and flushed with green,  
  And others white, with yellow sheen;  
  Some chestnuts; and some dapple gray:—  
  From carriage teams strong horses they!  
To the duke's thoughts no limit can we set;  
Turned to his steeds, such is the strength they get!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  On the wide
plains, our frontiers near,  
  The stallions, sleek and large, appear.  
  Oh! sleek and large, those sprightly males!  
  Some that appear as flecked with scales;  
  Some black, with manes of spotless white;  
  Some white or red, manes dark as night:—  
  In carriage yoked, obedient quite!  
The duke's thoughts never cease and never tire;  
Turned to his steeds, lo! thus they rule their fire! <span
id="page_464">p. 464</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>  On the wide
plains, our frontiers near,  
  The stallions, sleek and large, appear.  
  Oh! sleek and large, those stallions bright!  
  Cream-colored, some; some, red and white;  
  Some, with white hairy legs; with eyes  
  Like those of fishes, some:—men prize  
  Such horses, grand in strength and size.  
His thoughts without depravity, our prince  
Thinks of his steeds, and such powers they evince!
