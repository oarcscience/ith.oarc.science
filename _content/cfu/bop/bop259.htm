<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Kung Liu;</i> narrative. The story of Duke Liu:&#8212;how he made his first settlement in Pin, building there, laying out the ground, forming armies, arranging for a revenue, till even Pin became too small for all his people.</div></p>

Lo! at his girdle pendant seen,<br> The jade, and gems of yao, emit their sheen!<br> Sheathed in its glittering scabbard hangs the sword,<br> That safety from the foeman shall afford.</p>

Each plain<br> And marsh was measured; and to till the grain<br> An equal system framed: the farmers wrought,<br> And shared the produce, after they had brought<br> The fair proportion for himself he sought.<br> West of the hills the land he also tilled,<br> And grandly Pin with men and wealth was filled,</p>

Dwellings now they rear,<br> And makeshift huts before them disappear.<br> The houses good, their boundaries well defined,<br> The people multiply, and fortune kind<br> Attends their course. The vale of Huang they fill<br> On either side. The Kuo vale then they till.<br> Still grow their numbers; through the Jui they go;<br> Tracts widely spread now Liu's dominion know.</div></p>
