<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Hsiao Min;* narrative. A lamentation over the recklessness and
incapacity of the king's plans and of his counselors.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Oh! pitying Heaven
grows black with frown,  
  That darkens far this lower sphere,  
For crooked schemes mislead the crown;  
  Nor halts the king in his career!  
All counsels good and wise he spurns;  
To counsels bad he eager turns.  
  I mark his ways with pain and fear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>His creatures,
impotent and vain,  
  Now chime, now chafe, in rival mood.  
The case deserves our saddest strain!  
  If one proposes aught that's good,  
Against it all are firmly bound;  
If bad, then all will rally round.  
  Where will it end?—I sadly brood. <span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Our wearied
oracles are dumb,  
  And silence keep when we consult.  
Our counselors still thronging come,  
  With counsels barren of result.  
Though full the court, none dares to do;  
We plan the way we ne’er pursue,  
  And halting, helpless still we halt.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Ah me! the men who
lead the state,  
  Forsake the wisdom of the past.  
Unruled by maxims wise and great,  
  They veer with every fitful blast.  
They cannot on themselves rely.  
Builders, they ask each passer-by,  
  And leave their work undone at last.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Unsettled though
the land we see,  
  The many foolish, some are wise;  
And scanty though the people be,  
  Yet some can see, and some devise. <span id="page_252">p. 252</span>  
Some gravely think, and some have tact;  
Yet borne upon the cataract,  
  We sink in ruin, ne’er to rise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Who dares unarmed
the tiger face?  
  Who boatless dares to tempt the Ho?  
E’en their small wits see such a case,  
  But nothing greater do they know.  
With fear and caution should we tread,  
Like men above some torrent's bed,  
  Or those upon thin ice who go.
