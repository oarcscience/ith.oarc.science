#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Mien Man;* allusive. Some inferior complains of his toil in an
expedition, and of the neglect with which he was treated by his
superiors.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  Twitters fast
the oriole,  
    Where yonder bends the mound.  
  The happy little creature  
    Its resting place has found.  
So have not I. The journey's length  
And weary toil o’ertask my strength.  
Give me to eat; give me to drink;  
And teach my mind the way to think.  
Then bid a baggage cart prepare  
Along the route myself to bear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  Twitters fast
the oriole,  
    Where shows its edge the mound:  
  The happy little creature  
    Its resting place has found.  
So have not I. I dare not shrink  
From the long way, but trembling think,  
Unable to hold on, I'll sink. <span id="page_326">p. 326</span>  
Give me to drink; and give me food;  
And teach my mind the thing that's good.  
Then bid a baggage cart prepare  
Along the route myself to bear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>  Twitters fast
the oriole,  
    Where spreads its side the mound.  
  The happy little creature  
    Its resting place has found.  
So have not I. I dare not shrink  
From the long way, but trembling think,  
Before we reach the end, I'll sink.  
Give me to drink; to food invite;  
And tell my mind the thing that's right.  
Then bid a baggage cart prepare  
Along the route myself to hear.

</div>
