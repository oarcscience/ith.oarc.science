The *Wên Wang Yu Shêng;* narrative to the last stanza, which is
allusive. The praise of King Wên and King Wu:—how the former displayed
his military prowess only to secure the tranquillity of the people; how
this appeared in the building of Fêng as his capital city; and how the
latter entered, in his capital of Hao, into the sovereignty of the
kingdom with the sincere good will of all the people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Oh! the praise of
King Wên  
  Shall forever endure.  
For the people he sought,  
  How their rest to make sure.  
And his work he beheld  
  Made complete and secure;  
And our Wên was a sovereign true!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>’Twas the gift of
high heaven  
  That the throne did bestow.  
What success Wên achieved,  
  When great Chung was laid low!  
Fêng he called it, and moved  
  There, his grand state to show;  
And our Wên was a sovereign true! <span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>He repaired its
old walls,  
  And the old moat he cleared.  
As his sires had oft done,  
  So his new seat he reared.  
Not in haste did he build,  
  And the son more appeared;  
And our prince was a sovereign true!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Oh! how brightly
those walls  
  Did his merit display!  
From all quarters they came,  
  And would not be said nay.  
For to Fêng they repaired,  
  Their true homage to pay;  
And our prince was a sovereign true!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>East from Fêng
flowed the stream  
  That the same name did bear.  
’Twas the work of Great Yü  
  Made the water flow there.  
And to Fêng the states came,  
  Wu their king to declare;  
And our king was a sovereign true! <span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>Then to Hao Wu
removed,  
  And the pool-circled hall  
There he built, and received  
  The submission of all.  
East, west, north, and south,  
  Him their monarch they call;  
And our king was a sovereign true!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>Having thought of
the site,  
  By the shell Wu divined.  
As the shell answer gave,  
  So the site was assigned.  
Thus King Wu dwelt in Hao,  
  Where his city we find;  
And our Wu was a sovereign true!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>Where the Fêng
water flows,  
  Is the white millet grown.  
In the men Wu employed  
  How his merit was shown!  
To his sons he would leave  
  His wise plans and his throne;  
And our Wu was a sovereign true!
