<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chan Ang;</i> narrative, and allusive in the last stanza. The writer deplores the misery and oppression that prevailed, and intimates that they were caused by the interference of women and eunuchs in the government.</div></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_2">2</A></FONT></span>You now, O king, possess the lands,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Which as their own men once could claim;<br> And chiefs, who led their faithful bands,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Are stript of wealth, and brought to shame.<br> Men blameless, free from slightest taint,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Within that fearful net are snared;<br> While others walk without restraint,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whose guilt is openly declared.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>A wise man builds the city wall;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But a wise woman throws it down.<br> Wise is she?

Never came<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Lesson or warning word from them!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_4">4</A></FONT></span>Hurtful and false, their spite they wreak;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And when exposed their falsehood lies,<br> The wrong they do not own, but sneak,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And say, "No harm did we devise."<br> Thrice cent. per cent! Why that is trade,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And would the wise man but disgrace.<br> Public affairs to wife and maid<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Must not silkworms and looms displace.</p>  
<p>5 Why is it Heaven thus sends reproof?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why have the spirits ceased to bless?<br> From the wild Ti you keep aloof,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And me would in your wrath oppress.<br> Omens of ill you slight, though rife;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor for your outward bearing care.<br> The good fly from the scene of strife;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ruin impends, and blank despair. <a name="page_429"><font size="1" color="green">p. 429</font></A></p>
