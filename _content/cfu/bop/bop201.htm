<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Ch&ecirc;ng Y&uuml;eh;</i> narrative, allusive, and metaphorical. A lamentation over the miseries of the kingdom, and the ruin coming on it, all through the king's employment of worthless creatures, and his indulgence of his favorite Pao Ss&#365;.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1">1</A></FONT></span>On the brow of the summer the hoarfrost abounds;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sorrow's wound rankles deep in my heart,<br> And calumnies base, that the people perplex,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Daily waxing, inflict sharper smart.<br> All alone I am placed, none by me to stand;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Griefs intense more and more fill my breast.<br> Cares increase and disturb my sorrowful mind;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both in body and soul I'm distressed.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_2">2</A></FONT></span>O father and mother who bore me, your son,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Was it only to suffer such woe?<br> Why was I not born ere these evils arrived?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Or why came they ere I am laid low?<br> I hear their good words, which are but from the lip,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And their bad words have no deeper seat.<br> So shallow those men! And the more that I grieve,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With their fiercer contempt do I meet. <a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="green">p. 240</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>With the pang of great misery wringing my heart,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Dwell I thus on this comfortless time;<br> For the multitudes all will with me be brought<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To base servitude, guiltless of crime.<br> And alas for us all in positions more high!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;From what lord shall I now get support?<br> No more can I tell than,&#8212;see yonder a crow!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Can I tell to whose house &#8217;twill resort.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_4">4</A></FONT></span>Where the forest once grew, we look, and behold!!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Fagots only and twiglets are left.<br> To Heaven &#8217;midst their perils, the people all look,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! Heaven seems of reason bereft.<br> But is Heaven so dark? When its purpose is fixed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To its will opposition is vain.<br> And good is the Ruler supreme, the great God!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He hates none of the children of men.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span>&#8217;Tis only fools say that the mountains are low;&#8212;,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Gainst such words each high ridge would protest.<br> And as baseless the talk that is uttered by men, <a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="green">p. 241</font></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But the king lets it fly unrepressed.<br> To ministers old and diviners of dreams<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For advice he repairs, but they say,<br> "We are wise; but of crows which is female, which male,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To pronounce who can tell you the way?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_6">6</A></FONT></span>That the heavens are lofty who is there but knows?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet beneath them I bow my head low,<br> And that thick is the earth who is there but feels?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet with dainty steps on it I go.<br> For thus speaking and acting good reason I have,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In the conduct of many around,<br> Who originate all those calumnies base,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like the cobra or eft fatal found.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_7">7</A></FONT></span>Where the fields are rugged and stony, the grain<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet luxuriantly rises and grows.<br> Heaven fights against me as if I were its match,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Moves and shakes me, and then overthrows. <a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></A><br> As if I were hidden, they sought me at first,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;At the court for a pattern to shine.<br> &#8217;Tis with hatred intense they scowl now on me,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And my services curtly decline.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_8">8</A></FONT></span>With its sorrow my heart is deeply oppressed;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Tis as if with tight string it were bound.<br> Nowadays those who rule no kindness display;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce oppression prevails all around.<br> Blazing flames that spread wide, and terror inspire,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;May perhaps still be quenched at their height.<br> But our city august, where Chou holds its state,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Through this vile Sz&#365; of Pao sinks to night.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_9">9</A></FONT></span>That such issue will come is ever my thought;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And moreover, O king, let me say,<br> Like a wagoner you, and fast falls the rain!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy load suits but ill miry clay.<br> Wheel aids you may have, but if these you neglect,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the hands that would help you are spurned,<br> You soon will be crying, "O sir, give me aid,"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When the car of the state is o&#8217;erturned. <a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="green">p. 243</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_10">10</A></FONT></span>If your wheel aids you keep, and get them well plied,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That their help they shall give to each spoke,<br> And keep on the driver a vigilant eye,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Then your carriage will travel unbroke.<br> Your load will be safe, and your journey will come,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Though most rugged and hard, to its end;<br> But these things seem trifles, as looked upon now;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To the peril you will not attend.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_11">11</A></FONT></span>Shallow ponds on the fish small pleasure bestow;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To the bottom they dive, and there lie.<br> But the fisherman sharp them clearly perceives,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And a prey to his cunning they die.<br> And so, men of worth, in this kingdom oppressed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Little pleasure can ever possess;<br> For hatred pursues them, where&#8217;er they may hide.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How such things fill my heart with distress!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_12">12</A></FONT></span>Clear sparkle the spirits, set forth at their feasts,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the mats with fine viands are crowned.<br> Neighbors there and their kindred in numbers appear,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the halls with their praises resound.<br> So is it with those, the unworthy and base;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Such reward by their flattery they gain; <a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></A><br> While here I am left, and in solitude pine,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Struggling hard with my grief and my pain.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_13">13</A></FONT></span>Though mean, they are gifted with houses and lands;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Abjects vile, they their salaries draw;<br> But the people endure a hard, famished lot,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And are dealt with by Heaven's sternest law.<br> Rich men may succeed in a time so severe;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With their wealth and their stores they can live.<br> But alas for the poor, alone, without help!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Should the king not deliverance give?</div></p>
