<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Shih Y&uuml;eh Chih Chiao;</i> narrative. Lamentation of an officer over prodigies, celestial and terrestrial, betokening the ruin of Chou. He expounds the true causes of these and the abounding misery; names the chief culprits, and declares his own determination to remain at his post of duty.</div></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>And flashing levin shows the want of rest.<br> With troubled streams, and tumbling mountain's crest.<br> Large heights subside to vales; deep vales grow hills.<br> Alas! how does the king not stop these ills?</p>
