<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Chên Wei;* narrative. A festivity of Chêng, and advantage taken of
it for licentious assignations.

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>  Of the Chên and
the Wei  
    Onward the broad stream pours.  
  Women and men go by,  
    With valerian flowers.  
  To gentleman a lady says,  
  "Have you been there to see the plays?"  
  "I've been," he says, and she replies,  
  "Let's go again, and feast our eyes.  
  The ground beyond the Wei you'll find  
  Large, and for pleasure well designed." <span id="page_104">p.

  So gentlemen and ladies wend  
  Their way, in sport the day to spend,  
And to each other oft small peonies extend.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>  Of Chên and Wei
along  
    The lucid waters flow,  
  And on their banks a throng  
    Of men and women go.  
  To gentleman a lady says,  
  "Have you been there to see the plays?"  
  "I've been," says he, and she replies,  
  "Let's go again and feast our eyes.  
  The ground beyond the Wei you'll find  
  Large, and for pleasure well designed."  
  So gentlemen and ladies wend  
  Their way, in sport the day to spend,  
And to each other oft small peonies extend.
