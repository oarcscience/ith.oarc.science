<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>"How agile you
are!" ’Twas thus that I spoke,  
  What time near to Nao together we drew.  
Two boars three years old from cover then broke,  
  And we in our chariots after them flew.  
The chase being over, you said with a bow,  
"If agile am I, as active art thou!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>"How fine is your
skill!" So said I to you;  
  ’Twas when near to Nao we met on the way.  
That moment two males attracted our view,  
  And at them we dashed, to make them our prey.  
The chase being over, you said with a bow,  
"If skillful am I, not less so art thou!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>"How you know your
art!" I said to you then,  
  When south of Mount Nao together we came.  
That moment two wolves came under our ken,  
  And hotly we drove, well pleased with the game.  
The chase being over, you said with a bow,  
"If I know my art, as artful art thou!"
