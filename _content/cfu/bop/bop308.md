<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *P‘an Shui;* allusive and narrative. In praise of some marquis of
Lu, celebrating his interest in the state college, which probably he had
repaired or rebuilt, testifying his virtues, and auspicing for him a
complete triumph over the tribes of the Huai, which would be celebrated
in the college.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Fair is the pool,
half-circling round  
  The college of our land.  
The plants of cress that there abound  
  We pluck with eager hand.  
To it our prince of Lu draws nigh;  
We see his dragon banner fly,  
  Free waving in the wind.  
And as he moves, his horses' bells  
Tinkle harmonious, and fast swells  
  The crowd that comes behind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Fair is the pool,
half-circling round  
  The college of our land.  
The pondweed plants that there abound  
  We pluck with eager hand. <span id="page_467">p. 467</span>  
Arrived is now our prince of Lu,  
With team of steeds that grandly show,—  
  Steeds, each of highest worth.  
His fame is great. With winning smile.  
And blandest look, no haste the while,  
  His lessons he gives forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Fair is the pool,
half-circling round  
  The college of our land.  
The mallow plants that there abound  
  We pluck with eager hand.  
The college now our prince contains.  
Joyous, the festive cup he drains,—  
  The cup of spirits good.  
His be the strength that knows not age!  
His be the noble course and sage,  
  By which men are subdued!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>Our prince of Lu
has virtue rare;  
  His reverence we see.  
His every step he guards with care;  
  The people's mold is he. <span id="page_468">p. 468</span>  
In peace and war his powers are proved,  
His mighty sires are deeply moved;—  
  O’er him with love they bend.  
Through filial duty ever paid,  
And without farther effort made,  
  Blessings on him descend.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_5">5</span></span>Our prince of Lu
has wisdom great;  
  His virtue brighter grows.  
This college, glory of the state,  
  To him its beauty owes.  
The tribes of Huai will own his sway;  
His tiger chiefs down here will lay  
  The ears cut from their foes.  
His questioners, like Kao Yao wise,  
Will here rehearse their enterprise,  
  And captive kerns expose.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_6">6</span></span>His numerous
officers, all true,  
  And of a virtuous mind,  
Will haste with martial zeal to do  
  The part to them assigned;— <span id="page_469">p. 469</span>  
Those tribes from south and east. expel,  
Then back their triumphs come to tell,  
  And here themselves report.  
The duke no judge's help will need,  
As calm and truthful here they plead  
  Their claims before his court.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_7">7</span></span>They draw their
bows, with bone made strong.  
  How whiz the arrows fleet!  
Their cars of war dash swift along,  
  Eager the foe to meet.  
Drivers and footmen weary not,  
Till o’er the tribes of Huai is got  
  A victory entire.  
Your plans, O prince, be firm and true!  
So shall you all those tribes subdue,  
  And quench rebellion's fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8">8</span></span>On wing they come,
those owls, and rest  
  The college trees among.  
Our mulberry fruits they eat with zest,  
  Grown birds of sweetest song <span id="page_470">p. 470</span>  
So shall the Huai tribes change their minds,.  
And bring their tribute in all kinds  
  Of produce rich and rare;—  
The ivory tusks, the tortoise big,  
The metals from their mines they dig;—  
  Their fealty to declare.
