<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The Pai Chou; mostly narrative. An officer of worth bewails the neglect and contempt with which he was treated.</div></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;"><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1">1</A></FONT></span>It floats about, that boat of cypress wood,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Now here, now there, as by the current borne.<br> Nor rest nor sleep comes in my troubled mood;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I suffer as when painful wound has torn<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The shrinking body. Thus I dwell forlorn, <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And aimless muse, my thoughts of sorrow full.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might with wine refresh my spirit worn;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I might go forth, and, sauntering try to cool<br> The fever of my heart; but grief holds sullen rule.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_2">2</A></FONT></span>My mind resembles not a mirror plate,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting all th&#8217; impressions it receives.<br> The good I love, the bad regard with hate;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I only cherish whom my heart believes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Colleagues I have, but yet my spirit grieves,<br> That on their honor I cannot depend.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak, but my complaint no influence leaves<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon their hearts; with mine no feelings blend;<br> With me in anger they, and fierce disdain contend.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_3">3</A></FONT></span>My mind is fixed, and cannot, like a stone,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Be turned at will indifferently about;<br> And what I think, to that, and that alone,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I utterance give, alike within, without;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor can like mat be rolled and carried out.<br> With dignity, in presence of them all,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My conduct marked, my goodness who shall scout?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;My foes I boldly challenge, great and small,<br> If there be aught in me they can in question call. <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_4">4</A></FONT></span>How full of trouble is my anxious heart!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With hate the blatant herd of creatures mean<br> Ceaseless pursue. Of their attacks the smart<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps my mind in distress. Their venomed spleen<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Aye vents itself; and with insulting mien<br> They vex my soul; and no one on my side<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word will speak. Silent, alone, unseen,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I think of my sad case; then opening wide<br> My eyes, as if from sleep, I beat my breast, sore-tried.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span>Thy disk, O sun, should ever be complete,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;While thine, O changing moon, doth wax and wane.<br> But now our sun hath waned, weak and effete,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And moons are ever full. My heart with pain<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is firmly bound, and held in sorrow's chain,<br> As to the body cleaves an unwashed dress.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent I think of my sad case; in vain<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I try to find relief from my distress.<br> Would I had wings to fly where ills no longer press!</div></p>
