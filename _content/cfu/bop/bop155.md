#### III

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Shih Chiu;* allusive. The praise of some one, some earl, probably
of Ts'ao, uniformly of virtuous conduct and of extensive influence.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>See in the
mulberry tree the turtledove  
Her seven young tending with untiring love.  
Like her is he, our lord, whose virtuous aim  
His movements, all to rule exact, proclaim.  
His movements, all to rule exact, attest  
His heart to virtue bound within his breast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>The mulberry tree
still gives the dove to sight,  
But to the plum her young have taken flight.  
So is that princely man to virtue bound,  
Who ever with his 'silken sash is found. <span id="page_166">p.
166</span>  
In silken girdle loves he to appear,  
And bonnet made from skin of spotted deer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3">3</span></span>Behold the dove
upon the mulberry tree,  
While on the jujube her seven young we see.  
In soul so steadfast is that princely man,  
Whose course for fault of flaw we vainly scan.  
His movements without fault or flaw beget  
Good order for his rule throughout the state.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4">4</span></span>See on the
mulberry tree the dove still sit,  
And on the hazel all her young ones flit.  
So on his aim that princely man is set,  
Who rectifies the people of our state.  
His laws to all affairs such order give;—  
Ten thousand years in vigor may he live!

</div>
