<p><div style="font-size: 90%">The <i>Chia Lo;</i> narrative. In praise of some king,&#8212;perhaps King Ch&#8216;&ecirc;ng,&#8212;whose virtue secured to him the favor of Heaven; presaging for him all happiness, and especially a line of distinguished posterity. Probably the response of the personators of the departed to the preceding piece.</div></p>
