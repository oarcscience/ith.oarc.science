#### VI

<div style="font-size: 90%">

The *Mu Mên*; allusive. On some evil person who was going on obstinately
to his ruin.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; font-size: 110%;">

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1">1</span></span>Where through the
gate in to the tombs we go,  
Thick jujube trees, the ax requiring, grow.  
Like them that man, who ill befits his place,  
And through the state is reckoned a disgrace!  
All know him bad, but to his course he'll hold,  
So long to evil has the man been sold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2">2</span></span>Where through the
gate in to the tombs we turn,  
Owls perched upon the plum trees we discern.  
Such omen well may to that man belong,  
Whom to admonish I now sing this song.  
No welcome will the admonition find;  
When overthrown, my words he'll call to mind.

</div>
