### BRIGHT AUTUMNTIDE

I climb the mountain of Tsyu-i. I look down on  
      clear rivers.  
Coldly the Syan speeds along, cold as it widens  
      to meet the sea.  
Clouds break into autumn tints, the skies are  
      flaked with golden foam.  
I am now in the foreign regions of Tsin and U;  
      and countless are the miles of the trackless  
      way, brushed by the wings of birds alone,  
      lying between me and my native land.  
Now with its half-disk leaning upon some island  
      sets the evening sun.  
The lake is beginning to glow. There soars the  
      moon from the rim of the far-off sea.  
And all my thoughts are plunged into the hardy  
      loveliness of autumntide.  
Northward I wander in dream to Yan, southward  
      I search for Yuye…  
The lotus is falling, falling. The river is jewelled  
      with autumn hues.  
Long, long the wind blows…Long, long the  
      night wears!  
Fain would I grasp the incredible…  
Oh! to fly away seaward and dream for a little  
      by its shores!…  
To take from an island in blue ocean the six  
      monsters—

Alas, there is no such length of line.  
My hand caresses the surging wind; I am deeper  
      drowned in sorrow.  
I will away! away! Too strong is the life of  
      men for me.  
There in the magical land of P‘eng-lai I will  
      gather the grass of immortality.
