### LIU CHI

#### A.D. 1311-1375

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">The</span> most celebrated
of the poets belonging to the Mongol period, Liu Chi was also one of the
foremost adherents of the rising dynasty of Ming, and eventually became
Censor and Under-Secretary of State to the first Ming Emperor. The
jealousy of rivals, however, pursued him, and in the end he was poisoned
by his rival the Prime Minister, Hu Wei-yung. There is little depth in
the poems of Liu Chi, but much charm and considerable feeling for
natural beauty. A contemporary critic has described his poems as
"wind-blown petals."</span>

### THE CONVENT OF SIANG-FU

So I sprang to horse at cockcrow all a fever to depart,  
Galloped, galloped to the convent, ere the calling bells were still,  
Over dimpled lawns a zephyr woke the lily's jewelled heart,  
And the moon's faint crescent faltered down the cleft of wooded hill.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

Oh the lonely little convent with its secret haunts of prayer!  
With its shadowed cells for dreaming, where eternities abide.  
Down the cedar-scented alley not a footfall stirred the air,  
But the monks' low droning echoed in the green gloom far and wide.
