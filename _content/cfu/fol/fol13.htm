<p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">One</span> of the earliest of the T&#8216;ang poets. He was famous for his power of improvising, and seldom required to re-write a single line. His career, begun at the precocious age of six, was cut short by drowning when he was only twenty-nine. During this brief period, however, his influence was very great, and many students came to him for instruction in philosophy and literature.</small></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">A KING OF TANG</h3>  
<p>There looms a lordly pleasure-tower o&#8217;er yon dim shore,<br> Raised by some King of Tang.<br> Jade pendants at his girdle clashed, and golden bells<br> Around his chariot rang.</p>  
<p>Strange guests through sounding halls at dawn go trailing by,<br> Grey mists and mocking winds;<br> And sullen brooding twilights break in rain on rain,<br> To lash the ragged blinds.</p>  
<p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></A></p>  
<p>The slow, sun-dappled clouds lean down o&#8217;er waters blue,<br> Clear mirrored one by one;<br> Then drift as all the world shall drift. The very stars<br> Their timeless courses run.</p>  
<p>How many autumn moons have steeped those palace walls!<br> And paled the shattered beams!<br> What is their royal builder now? A Lord of dust?<br> An Emperor of dreams?</p>
