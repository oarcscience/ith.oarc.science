### THE TOMB OF CHAO-CHÜN

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Death would have ravished her some hapless day  
Even among the palaces of Han,  
But she was never born to taste  
The bitterness of fate so far away—  
This pearl of beauty for whose sake did haste  
The camels' golden-gleaming caravan.  
To-day but dust and bones remain  
Of her whose ransom threaded the cold steppes in vain.

Night fell on chariots to the frontier ranged,  
But horses champed, for none were fain to part.  
Each cursed the lying hand, the traitor's heart.  
The moon surprised us scattered round the tomb,  
And all our tears were changed  
To little piteous lights that ringed the gloom.
