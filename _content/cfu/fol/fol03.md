# A FEAST OF LANTERNS

### INTRODUCTION

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> Spring, "for sheer delight," sang Yuan
Mei, "I set the lanterns swinging through the trees." This was no formal
Feast of Lanterns held in the first month of the year, but his own
private affair, the lonely ritual of a spring-worshipper and garden
anchorite.

Perhaps those who loved him—and they were many—wandered his pleached
alleys and maple groves and admired the lanterns with their red dragons
that leaped and plunged in gold and silver seas; but I like to think
that the guests were gone in long procession of gleaming boats when the
old rose-master looked on his garden and found it whiter and fairer than
the far-off moon. At once you guess the whole charm and weakness of
Chinese poetry. Here is the narrow moon-garden of its range, its myriad
dragons shoaling through unreal seas, its peonies with the souls of
mandarins and chrysanthemums with the shadows of children. Yet this
sense of limitation and unreality belongs only to the surface; within
