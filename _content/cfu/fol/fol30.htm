<p><small><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">One</span> of the wittiest and most brilliant of the Tang statesmen and philosophers, Han Y&uuml;'s poetry has been overshadowed by his prose essays, which have been upheld as models of Chinese literature. He attempted to found a new school of Confucianism, being a bitter opponent of the Buddhist tendencies of his day, and was banished to a semi-barbarous region which he set to work to civilise. Su Tung-p&#8216;o, the great Sung poet, wrote a magnificent poem to his memory which has been translated by Professor Giles (cf. <i>Chinese Literature,</i> p. 161).</small></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">DISAPPOINTMENT</h3>  
<p>Still moonlight floods the inner gallery,<br> Where the japonica sets fluttering<br> Her silvered petals. Languidly<br> I rise, and let my absent glance<br> Fall where the shadows of the swing<br> Over the door-step dance.</p>  
<p>I am possessed<br> By spring's rough humid winds that penetrate<br> The silken curtains of my lonely state,<br> And cannot rest,</p>

<p>For all my sorrow.<br> During the night I hear the heavy rain<br> Crash on the lotus pool afar.<br> To-morrow! ah to-morrow!<br> The little boat lies swamped that I would fain<br> Have steered in search of the golden nenuphar.</p>
