### PO CHÜ-I

#### A.D. 772-846

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">One</span> of the greatest
statesmen that China has produced. Po Chü-i comes nearer to our idea of
a poet of the Romantic School than most Chinese writers. Yet even when
he tells the story of the Emperor Ming Huang and the Lady Yang
Kwei-fei—the one supreme love romance of China—he deals with issues that
endure beyond the curtain-fall on tragedy. For him the final crisis is
never attained. A wrong done has results beyond the reach of time. For a
fuller account of this poet cf. *A Lute of Jade,* p. 73.</span>

### IN YUNG-YANG

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I was a child in Yung-yang,  
A little child I waved farewell.  
After long years again I dwell  
In world-forgotten Yung-yang.  
Yet I recall my play-time,  
And in my dreams I see  
The little ghosts of May-time  
Waving farewell to me.

My father's house in Yung-yang  
Has fallen upon evil days.  
No kinsmen o’er the crooked ways  
Hail me as once in Yung-yang.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

No longer stands the old Moot-hall,  
Gone is the market from the town;  
The very hills have tumbled down  
And stoned the valleys in their fall.

Only the waters of the Ch‘in and Wei  
Roll green and changeless as in days gone by.

Yet I recall my play-time,  
And in my dreams I see  
The little ghosts of May-time  
Waving farewell to me.
