<p align="center"><i>He resigned Office to seek his Mother</i></p>  
<p>In the Sung dynasty lived Chu Shou-ch&#145;ang, whose mother, Liu, when he was seven years of age, left the family because she was hated by his father's wife; and mother and son did not see each other for about fifty years. It was during the reign of Sh&ecirc;n Tsung that Chu resigned his official station and went into the Ch&#145;in country, and there made an engagement with his family "that he would not return until he had found his mother." He then travelled into T&#145;ung-chou, where he discovered his mother, who at that time was over seventy years of age.</p>  
<p>Thus Chu exclaimed: "I have a mother; but, alas! separated, we abide in different villages.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> It was not the free will of my mother which led her thus to forsake her son, but the envious mistress who compelled her to go. Without a mother, on whom shall I rely? to whom shall I pour out my sorrows and cares? Now I am grown older and have become an officer, but as yet I have been unable to return the kindness of my parent. In what place, among all the countries under heaven, does she live? I am determined to resign my office and seek her abode, not deterred from the trouble of the search. To effect it, I will part from my family and no longer be a companion with them; I will not return till I find my mother, and they need not await in expectation of me." Heaven directed his way, and he came into T&#145;ung-chou, where she resided. When the mother and the son met each other, joy and grief arose together&#151;joy for the meeting after fifty years, sorrow that they had been so long apart. But now, in one hour, all their long-accumulated griefs were laid aside, and joy and gladness filled their hearts. Chu possesses the true heavenly disposition, and honours and riches cannot destroy his affection for his mother.</p>
