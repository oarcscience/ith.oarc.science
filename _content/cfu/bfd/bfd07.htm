<p align="center"><small>THE FILIAL DUTY OF HIGH OFFICERS</small></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">If</span> we do not put on such dress as our good Emperors of old would forbid, if we do not speak such words as they would forbid, and if we do not behave ourselves in such a way as they would forbid, then we shall be always right in what we say and what we do. If so, then nobody</p>  
<p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></A></p>  
<p>will be able to find fault with our words or with our deeds, and therefore we shall be able to keep our family from being visited with any serious misfortune, and to offer sacrifices to our ancestors for ever. This is the filial duty of a high officer.</p>  
<p>In the <i>Shih Ching</i> it is thus written: "Be diligent every minute to attend upon the one person " (meaning the Emperor).</p>
