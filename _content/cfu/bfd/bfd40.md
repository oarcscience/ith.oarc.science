*The Book of Filial Duty*, by Ivan Chen, \[1908\], at Intangible Textual

#### No. XIX

*He slept on Ice to procure Carp*

During the Chin dynasty lived Wang Hsiang, who early lost his mother,
and whose stepmother

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Chu had no
affection for him. His father also, hearing many evil reports against
him, in course of time ceased to regard him with kindness. His mother
was in the habit of eating fresh fish at her meals, but winter coming,
the ice bound up the rivers. Wang unloosed his clothes, and went to
sleep on the ice in order to seek them; when suddenly the ice opened of
itself, and two carp leapt out, which he took up and carried to his
mother. The villagers, hearing of the affair, were surprised, and
admired one whose filial duty was the cause of such an unusual event.

The river is firmly bound up by ice, and the fish are hidden in their
deep retreats. Perturbed and anxious, Wang goes out to seek the fish,
apparently forgetting that it was winter. His resolution is fixed, and
although it is at the risk of his life, he will go. He was not dismayed
at the coldness of the snow, nor terrified at the fierceness of the
winds. Even the wicked spirits were deterred from injuring him, and
dared not molest him. If metals and stones can be opened, shall ice be
considered too difficult to cleave? The frisking fish came up on the
surface of the water, obedient to the hand of him who would take them
out. A thousand ages cannot efface the remembrance of the crack in the
ice, nor obliterate the fragrant traces of so worthy a deed.
