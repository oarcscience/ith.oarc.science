#### CHAPTER VII

<span class="small">THE "THREE POWERS"</span> <span

<span class="smallcaps">On</span> hearing what Confucius said about
filial duty, Tsêng Tzŭ remarked: "How great is the use of filial duty!"
Here Confucius continued: "Filial duty is the constant doctrine of
Heaven, the natural righteousness of Earth, and the practical duty of
man. Every member of the community ought to observe it with the greatest

care. We do what is dictated by Heaven and what is good for the general
public in order to organise the community. On this account our education
is wide-spread, though it is not compulsory, and our government is
sound, though it is not rigorous. The effect of education upon the minds
of the people was well known to the good Emperors of old. They made
every person love his parents by loving their own parents first. They
induced every person to cultivate his virtue by expounding the
advantages of virtue to him. They behaved themselves respectfully and
humbly, so that the people might not quarrel with one another. They
trained the people with ceremonial observances, and educated them with
music so that they might live in harmony. They told the people what
things they liked or disliked to see done, so that they might understand
what they were forbidden to do.

In the *Shih Ching* it is thus written: "The dignified statesman is
always the subject of the attention of the people."
