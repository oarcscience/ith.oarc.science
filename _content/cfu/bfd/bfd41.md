*Wu Mêng fed the Mosquitoes*

Wu Mêng, a lad eight years of age, who lived in the Chin dynasty, was
very dutiful to his parents. They were so poor that they could not
afford to furnish their beds with mosquito-curtains; and every summer
night myriads of mosquitoes attacked them without restraint, feasting
upon their flesh and blood. Although there were so many, yet Wu would
not drive them away from himself, lest they should go to his parents and
annoy them. Such was his filial affection!

The buzzing of the mosquitoes sounds like *ying, ying,* and their united
hum is almost equal to thunder. His tired parents are reclining on their
bed, their countenances already sunk in slumber. Legions of mosquitoes
fiercely attack them, alternately retreating and advancing. The insects
disturb the dreaming sleepers, and with annoyance they toss from side to
side. Wu sees them sucking his parents' blood, which causes his heart to
grieve; his flesh, he thinks, can be easily pierced, but that of his
parents is hard to penetrate. Lying on the bed, he threw off his
clothes, and soon feeling the pain of their attacks, he cried: "I have
no dread of you, nor have you any reason to fear me; although I have a
fan, I will not use it, nor will I strike you with

my hand. I will lie very quietly, and let you gorge to the full."
