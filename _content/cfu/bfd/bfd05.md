#### CHAPTER II

<span class="small">THE FILIAL DUTY OF AN EMPEROR</span>

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> order to prevent the people from
treating their parents with cruelty, the Emperor first sets an example
to them by showing a dear love to his mother; and in order to teach them
not to treat their parents with rudeness, he first treats his parents
with respect. Having loved and respected his own parents, his good
conduct will influence the minds of his people, and his good example
will be followed by them.

So it is written in the *Fu Hsin*g <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2):
"When the Emperor has done a good act, millions will be benefited."
