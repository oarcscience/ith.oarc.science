<p align="center"><small>THE FIVE PUNISHMENTS</small></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> criminal law consists principally of five punishments, which are directed against three thousand offences. Of them, disobedience to one's parents is considered the most heinous crime.</p>  
<p>To threaten the sovereign with force is an act which shows that the wrongdoer does not know the duty of an inferior to a superior; to say anything against the government founded by the wise men of many generations gone by is an act which shows that the speaker does not know what law is; and to say that a son need not be filial to his parents is also an act which shows that the speaker does not know what is the natural relation and duty between a son and parents. Such acts will no doubt lead the man to a wrong course of life.</p>
