#### No. VIII

*He sold himself to bury his Father*

During the Han dynasty lived Tung Yung, whose family was so very poor
that when his father died, he was obliged to sell himself in order to
procure money to bury his remains. After this he went to another place
to gain the means of redeeming himself; and on his way he met a lady who
desired to become his wife, and go with him to his master's house. She
went with Tung, and wove three hundred pieces of silk, which being
completed in two months, they returned home; and on the way, having
reached the shade of the cassia-tree where they met before, the lady bid
him adieu and vanished from his sight.

Tung could not endure to behold his father's bones lying exposed, but
had not sufficient means to bury them. He saw that his household goods
were not sufficient, and he said: "This little body of mine, what is the
use of it? If I sell it, I can

redeem it again, and thus bury my father, who will be saved from
dishonour." His filial piety moved Heaven to direct a female spirit in
human form to come and help him in fulfilling his engagement; she wove
three hundred pieces of silk, and thus procured the redemption of a man
of truly filial heart.
