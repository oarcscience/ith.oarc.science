#### No. II

*Affection shown in tasting Soups and Medicines*

The Emperor Wên of the Han dynasty, the third son of his father, Kao
Tsu, was appointed

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Prince over the
country of Tai. His own mother, Po, was Queen-dowager, and Wên was
constant in his attendance on her. She was ill for three years, during
which time his eyelids did not close, nor was the girdle of his dress
unloosed; and she took none of the soups and medicines prepared for her
till he had tasted them. This benevolence and filial affection was heard
of throughout the empire.

Wên received direction to go and arrange the imperial sacrifices, and
requested his mother to accompany him to the royal domains. Morning and
evening he visited her in her own apartments, and handed her the
fragrant dishes. If the provisions had lost their flavour, he was vexed;
and when tasting the medicines he commanded perfect silence. The
live-long night his girdle was not loosed, nor for three years were his
eyelids closed. By as much as his animal spirits were exhausted, by so
much the more did his heart become fixed on the subject of its
affection; and for a long time his thoughts were not distracted. Such
filial love and virtue so moved upon Heaven's kind regard, that it
wrought upon his father to confer the throne upon him as his patrimony.
