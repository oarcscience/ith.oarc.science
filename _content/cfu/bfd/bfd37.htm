<p align="center"><i>He laid up the Oranges for his Mother</i></p>  
<p>Lu Chi, a lad six years old, who lived in the time of Han and in the district of Kinkiang, once met the celebrated general Y&uuml;an Shu, who gave him a few oranges. Two of them the lad put in his bosom, and when turning to thank the giver, they fell out on the ground. When the general saw this, he said: "Why does my young friend, who is now a guest, put the fruit away in his bosom?" The youth, bowing, replied: "My mother is very fond of oranges, and I wished, when I returned home, to present them to her." At this answer Y&uuml;an was much astonished.</p>  
<p>On account of his love for his parent, he would not at first taste the present of fruit, but put into his sleeve to carry home the fragrant and luscious gift. I think that when he saw his mother, her pleasant countenance must have brightened, for the fruit filled his bosom and delighted all who came near him. Lu, although so young, had the true heavenly disposition; even in the small matter of an orange he did not forget his parent's wishes. Many children are perhaps like this boy,</p>

<p>and those who requite their parents for the care bestowed upon them, we hope, are not few.</p>
