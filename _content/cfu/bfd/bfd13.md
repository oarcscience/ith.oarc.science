#### CHAPTER X

<span class="small">THE FILIAL DUTY OF A SON</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Confucius</span> said: "A filial son has five
duties to perform to his parents: (1) He must venerate them in daily
life. (2) He must try to make them happy in every possible way,
especially when the meal is served. (3) He must take extra care of them
when they are sick. (4) He ought to show great sorrow for them when they
are dead. (5) He must offer sacrifices to his deceased parents with the
utmost solemnity. If he fulfils these duties, then he can be considered
as having done what ought to be done by a son."

A son ought not to feel proud of the high position he occupies, ought
not to show dissatisfaction with his inferior position to that of
others, and ought not to act against the natural feeling of the public.
If he is proud and haughty when he is a high official, he will soon
bring ruin upon himself and his family; if he feels dissatisfied with
his lower position, he may be led to do illegal acts; and if he does
anything contrary to the public feeling, he will probably be the

object of attacks. Having thus wronged himself, he cannot be considered
as a filial son, although he treats his parents every day to luxurious
meals.
