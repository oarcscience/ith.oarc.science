<p align="center"><small>AMPLIFICATION OF THE "IMPORTANT DOCTRINE"</small></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Confucius</span> said: "The best way to teach the people to love their sovereign is for the sovereign</p>  
<p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></A></p>  
<p>first to love his own parents; to teach them to be polite to each other is for the sovereign himself first to be polite to all his elders; and to improve bad manners and customs is for him first to pay attention to the composition of the music played in the country.</p>  
<p>"What is etiquette? It is simply due respect to one's elders. If I respect the parents, the son will be pleased; if I respect the elder brothers, the younger ones will be pleased; and if I respect the sovereign, all the ministers will be pleased. I respect only one person, but I please thousands upon thousands. Those to whom the respect is paid are few, and those whom I please are many. This is what is called "an important doctrine."</p>
