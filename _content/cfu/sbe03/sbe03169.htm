<p>THE odes of Thang were really the odes of &#540;in, the greatest of the fiefs of <I>K</I>&acirc;u until the rise of <I>Kh</I>in. King <I>Kh</I>&#259;ng, in B.C. 1107, invested his younger brother, called Sh&ucirc;-y&uuml;, with the territory where Y&acirc;o was supposed to have ruled anciently as the marquis of Thang, in the present department of Th&acirc;i-y&uuml;an, Shan-hs&icirc;, the fief retaining that ancient name. Subsequently the name of the state was changed to &#540;in, from the river &#540;in in the southern part of it.</p>
