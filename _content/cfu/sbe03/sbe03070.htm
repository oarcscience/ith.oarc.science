</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">II. THE SACRIFICIAL ODES OF K&Acirc;U.</h3>  
<p>IN this division we have thirty-one sacrificial odes of <I>K</I>&acirc;u, arranged in three decades, the third of which, however, contains eleven pieces. They belong mostly to the time of king W&#259;n, the founder of the <I>K</I>&acirc;u dynasty, and to the reigns of his son and grandson, kings W&ucirc; and <I>Kh</I>&#259;ng. The decades are named from the name of the first piece in each.</p>  <h4 align="center">The First Decade, or that of <I>Kh</I>ing Mi&acirc;o.</h4>  <h5 align="center">ODE 1.
