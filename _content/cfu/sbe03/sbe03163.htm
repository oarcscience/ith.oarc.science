<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The state of Wei was reduced to extremity by an irruption of some northern hordes in B.C. 660, and had nearly disappeared from among the states of <I>K</I>&acirc;u.

Its culminating at night-fall was the signal that the labours of husbandry were over for the year, and that building operations should be taken in hand.
