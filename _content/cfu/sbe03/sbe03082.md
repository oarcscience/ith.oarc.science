##### ODE 3. THE *K*ÂU LÛ.

##### CELEBRATING THE REPRESENTATIVES OF FORMER DYNASTIES, WHO HAD COME TO COURT TO ASSIST AT A SACRIFICE IN THE ANCESTRAL TEMPLE.

This piece may have been used when the king was dismissing his
distinguished guests in the ancestral temple. See the introductory note
to this Part, pp. [300](sbe03063.htm#page_300), 301.

A flock of egrets is flying, About the marsh there in the west <span
id="fr_371"></span>[3](#fn_358). My visitors came, With an (elegant)
carriage like those birds.

There, (in their states), not disliked, Here, (in *K*âu), never tired
of;--They are sure, day and night, To perpetuate their fame.
