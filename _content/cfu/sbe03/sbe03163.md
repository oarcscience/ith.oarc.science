#### ODE 6, STANZAS 1 AND 2. THE TING *K*IH FANG *K*ÛNG.

#### CELEBRATING THE PRAISE OF DUKE WĂN;--HIS DILIGENCE, FORESIGHT, USE OF DIVINATION, AND OTHER QUALITIES.

The state of Wei was reduced to extremity by an irruption of some
northern hordes in B.C. 660, and had nearly disappeared from among the
states of *K*âu. Under the marquis Wei, known in history as duke Wăn,
its fortunes revived, and he became a sort of second founder of the
state.

When Ting culminated (at night-fall) <span

*Kh*û <span id="fr_626"></span>[4](#fn_606), Determining}

its aspects by means of the sun. He built the palace at Khû. He planted
about it hazel and chesnut trees, The Î, the Thung, the Ȝze, and the
varnish tree. Which, when cut down, might afford materials for lutes.

He ascended those old walls, And thence surveyed (the site of) *Kh*û. He
surveyed *Kh*û and Thang <span id="fr_627"></span>[1](#fn_607), With the
lofty hills and high elevations about. He descended and examined the
mulberry trees. He then divined by the tortoise-shell, and got a
favourable response <span id="fr_628"></span>[2](#fn_608); And thus the
issue has been truly good.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_605"></span>[436:3](sbe03163.htm#fr_625) Ting is the name
of a small space in the heavens, embracing α Markab and another star of
Pegasus. Its culminating at night-fall was the signal that the labours
of husbandry were over for the year, and that building operations should
be taken in hand. Great as was the urgency for the building of his new
capital, duke Wăn would not take it in hand till the proper time for
such a labour was arrived.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[436:4](sbe03163.htm#fr_626) *Kh*û, or
*Kh*û-*kh*iû, was the new capital of Wei, in the present district of
*Kh*ăng-wû, department *Ȝh*âo-kâu, Shan-tung.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[437:1](sbe03163.htm#fr_627) Thang was the name
of a town, evidently not far from Khû.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[437:2](sbe03163.htm#fr_628) We have seen
before how divination was resorted to on occasion of new undertakings,
especially in proceeding to rear a city.
