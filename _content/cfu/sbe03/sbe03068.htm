I think this is the oldest of the odes of Shang.</FONT></p>  
<p>Profoundly wise were (the lords of) Shang, And long had there appeared the omens (of their dignity).</p>  
<p>When the waters of the deluge spread vast abroad, Y&ucirc; arranged and divided the regions of the land, And assigned to the exterior great states their boundaries, With their borders extending all over (the kingdom). (Even) then the chief of Sung was beginning to be great, And God raised up the son (of his daughter), and founded (the line of) Shang&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The dark king exercised an effective sway&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Charged with a small state, he commanded success: Charged with a large state, he commanded success&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. He followed his rules of conduct without error; Wherever he inspected (the people), they responded (to his instructions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. (Then came) Hsiang-th&ucirc; all ardent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, And all within the four seas, beyond (the middle regions), acknowledged his restraints.}</p>

<p>The favour of God did not leave (Shang), And in Thang was found the fit object for its display. Thang was not born too late, And his wisdom and reverence daily advanced:--Brilliant was the influence of his character (on Heaven) for long. God he revered, And God appointed him to be the model for the nine regions.</p>  
<p>He received the rank-tokens of the states, small and large, Which depended on him like the pendants of a banner:--So did he receive the blessing of Heaven. He was neither violent nor remiss, Neither hard nor soft. Gently he spread his instructions abroad, And all dignities and riches were concentrated in him.</p>  
<p>He received the tribute of the states, small and large, And he supported them as a strong steed (does its burden):--So did he receive the favour of Heaven. He displayed everywhere his valour, Unshaken, unmoved, Unterrified, unscared:--All dignities were united in him.</p>  
<p>The martial king displayed his banner, And with reverence grasped his axe. It was like (the case of) a blazing fire which no one can repress. The root, with its three shoots, Could make no progress, no growth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_337"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The nine regions were effectually secured by Thang.

<P><A NAME="fn_332"></A><A HREF="sbe03068.htm#fr_344">309:1</A> This line refers to the birth of Hsieh, as described in the previous ode, and his being made lord of Shang.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_333"></A><A HREF="sbe03068.htm#fr_345">309:2</A> It would be hard to say why Hsieh is here called 'the dark king.' There may be an allusion to the legend about the connexion of the swallow,--'the dark bird,'--with his birth, He never was 'a king;' but his descendants here represented him as such.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_334"></A><A HREF="sbe03068.htm#fr_346">309:3</A> All that is meant here is, that the territory of Shang was enlarged under Hsieh.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_335"></A><A HREF="sbe03068.htm#fr_347">309:4</A> There is a reference here to Hsieh's appointment by Shun to be Minister of Instruction.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_336"></A><A HREF="sbe03068.htm#fr_348">309:5</A> Hsiang-th&ucirc; appears in the genealogical lists as grandson of Hsieh. We know nothing of him but what is related here.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_337"></A><A HREF="sbe03068.htm#fr_349">310:1</A> By 'the root' we are to understand Thang's chief opponent, <I>K</I>ieh, the last king of Hsi&acirc;. <I>K</I>ieh's three great helpers were 'the three shoots,'--the princes of Wei, K&ucirc;, and <I>K</I>&uuml;n-w&ucirc;; but the exact sites of their principalities cannot be made out.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_338"></A><A HREF="sbe03068.htm#fr_350">311:1</A> We do not know anything of this time of decadence in the fortunes of Shang between Hsieh and Thang.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_339"></A><A HREF="sbe03068.htm#fr_351">311:2</A> &Acirc;-h&#259;ng is &Icirc; Yin, who plays so remarkable a part in the Sh&ucirc;, IV, Books iv, v, and vi.</P>
