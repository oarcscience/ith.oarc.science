<p><FONT SIZE="-1">THE Speech at P&icirc; carries us back from the time of Phing to that of king <I>Kh</I>&#259;ng. In the Preface to the Sh&ucirc; it is attributed to Po-<I>kh</I>in, the son of the duke of <I>K</I>&acirc;u; and there is a general acquiescence of tradition and critics in this view. We may account for its position out of the chronological order from</FONT></p>

<p><FONT SIZE="-1">the Book's being the record not of any royal doings, but of the words of the ruler of a state.</p>  
<p>The speech has reference to some military operations against the wild tribes on the Hw&acirc;i river and in other parts of the province of Hs&uuml;; and we have seen that they were in insurrection many times during the reign of <I>Kh</I>&#259;ng. We thus cannot tell exactly the year in which the speech was delivered. Po-<I>kh</I>in presided over his state of L&ucirc; for the long period of fifty-three years, and died B.C. 1063.</p>  
<p>The name of P&icirc; is retained in the district still so called of the department of &Icirc;-<I>k</I>&acirc;u. At first it was an independent territory, but attached to L&ucirc;, and under the jurisdiction of its marquises, by one of whom it had been incorporated with L&ucirc; before the time of Confucius.</p>  
<p>Po-<I>kh</I>in appears at the head of his host, approaching the scene of active operations. Having commanded silence, he issues his orders, first, that the soldiers shall have their weapons in good order; next, that the people of the country shall take care of the oxen and horses of the army; further, that the troops on no account leave their ranks or go astray; and finally, he names the day when he will commence operations against the enemy, and commands all the requisite preparations to be made.</FONT></p>  
<p>The duke said, 'Ah! ye men, make no noise, but. listen to my commands. We are going (to punish) those wild tribes of the Hw&acirc;i and of Hs&uuml;, which have risen up together.</p>  
<p>'Have in good repair your buff coats and helmets; have the laces of your shields well secured;--presume not to have any of them but in perfect order. Prepare your bows and arrows; temper your lances and spears; sharpen your pointed and edged weapons;--presume not to have any of them but in good condition.</p>  
<p>'We must now largely let the oxen and horses loose, and not keep them in enclosures;--(ye people), do you close your traps and fill up your; pitfalls, and do not presume to injure any of the animals (so let loose). If any of them be injured,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A></p>  
<p>you shall be dealt with according to the regular punishments.</p>  
<p>'When the horses or cattle are seeking one another, or when your followers, male or female, abscond, presume not to leave the ranks to pursue them. But let them be carefully returned. I will reward you (among the people) who return them according to their value. But if you leave your places to pursue them, or if you who find them do not restore them, you shall be dealt with according to the regular punishments.</p>  
<p>'And let none of you presume to commit any robbery or detain any creature that comes in your way, to jump over enclosures and walls to steal (people's) horses or oxen, or to decoy away their servants or female attendants. If you do so, you shall be dealt with according to the regular punishments.</p>  
<p>'On the day <I>K</I>i&acirc;-hs&uuml; I will take action against the hordes of Hs&uuml;;--prepare the roasted grain and other provisions, and presume not to have any deficiency. If you have, you shall suffer the severest punishment. Ye men, of L&ucirc;, from the three environing territories and the three tracts beyond&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_312"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,</p>

<p>be ready with your posts and planks. On <I>K</I>i&acirc;-hs&uuml; I will commence my intrenchments;--dare not but be provided with a supply of these. (If you be not so provided), you shall be subjected to various punishments, short only of death. Ye men of L&ucirc;, from the three environing territories and the three tracts beyond, be ready with the forage, and do not dare to let it be other than abundant. (If you do), you shall suffer the severest punishment.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_300"></A><A HREF="sbe03056.htm#fr_312">269:1</A> Outside the capital city was an environing territory called the <I>K</I>i&acirc;o, and beyond the <I>K</I>i&acirc;o was the Sui. The <I>K</I>i&acirc;o of the royal domain was divided again into six Hsiang, which furnished the six royal hosts, while the Sui beyond furnished subsidiary hosts. The <I>K</I>i&acirc;o and Sui of a large state furnished three hosts, and if need were, subsidiary battalions. The language of the text is equivalent, I conceive, simply to 'ye men of the army of L&ucirc;;' but, as P. Gaubil observes, it is difficult at the present day to get correct ideas of what is meant by the designations, and to account for the mention of three <I>K</I>i&acirc;o and three Sui.</P>
