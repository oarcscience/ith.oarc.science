</p>  <h5 align="center">ODE 9. THE HWAN.</h5>  <h5 align="center">CELEBRATING THE MERIT AND SUCCESS OF KING W&Ucirc;.</h5>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">According to a statement in the &#540;o <I>K</I>wan, this piece also was sung in connexion with the dance of W&ucirc;. The Preface says it was used in declarations of war, and in sacrificing to God and the Father of War. Perhaps it came to be used on such occasions; but we must refer it in the first place to the reign of king <I>Kh</I>&#259;ng.</FONT></p>  
<p>There is peace throughout our myriad regions. There has been a succession of plentiful years:--Heaven does not weary in its favour. The martial king W&ucirc; Maintained (the confidence of) his officers, And employed them all over the kingdom, So securing the establishment of his family. Oh! glorious was he in the sight of Heaven, Which kinged him in the room (of Shang).</p>
