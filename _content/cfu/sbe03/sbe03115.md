#### ODE 3, STANZAS 1 AND 3. THE HSIÂO PAN.

#### THE ELDEST SON AND HEIR-APPARENT OF KING YÛ BEWAILS HIS DEGRADATION, APPEALING TO HEAVEN AS TO HIS INNOCENCE, AND COMPLAINING OF ITS CASTING HIS LOT IN SUCH A TIME.

It is allowed that this piece is clearly the composition of a banished
son, and there is no necessity to call in question the tradition
preserved in the Preface which prefers it to Î-*kh*iû, the eldest son of
king Yû. His mother was a princess of the House of Shan; but when Yû
became enamoured of Sze of Pâo, the queen was degraded, and the son
banished to Shan.

With flapping wings the crows Come back, flying all in a flock <span
id="fr_438"></span>[1](#fn_424). Other people are happy, And I only am
full of misery. What is my offence against Heaven? What is my crime? My
heart is sad; What is to be done?

Even the mulberry trees and the rottleras Must be regarded with
reverence <span id="fr_439"></span>[2](#fn_425); But no one is to be
looked up to like a father, No one is to be depended on as a mother.
Have I not a connexion with the hairs (of my father)? Did I not dwell in
the womb (of my mother)? O Heaven, who gave me birth! How was it at so
inauspicious a time?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_424"></span>[360:1](sbe03115.htm#fr_438) The sight of the
crows, all together, suggests to the prince his own condition, solitary
and driven from court.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[360:2](sbe03115.htm#fr_439) The mulberry tree
and the rottlera were both planted about the farmsteadings, and are
therefore mentioned here. They carried the thoughts back to the father
or grandfather, or the more remote ancestor, who first planted them, and
so a feeling of reverence attached to themselves.
