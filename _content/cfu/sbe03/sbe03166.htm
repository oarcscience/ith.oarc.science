<p>KING W&#259;n, it has been seen, had for his capital the city of F&#259;ng, from which his son, king W&ucirc;, moved the seat of government to H&acirc;o. In the time of king <I>Kh</I>&#259;ng, a city was built by the duke</p>

<p>of K&acirc;u, near the present Lo-yang, and called 'the eastern capital.' Meetings of the princes of the states assembled there; but the court continued to be held at H&acirc;o till the accession of king Phing in B.C. 770. From that time, the kings of <I>K</I>&acirc;u sank nearly to the level of the princes of the states, and the poems collected in their domain were classed among the 'Lessons of Manners from the States,' though still distinguished by the epithet 'royal' prefixed to them.</p>
