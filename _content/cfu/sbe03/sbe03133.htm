THE HWANG &Icirc;.</h4>  <h4 align="center">SHOWING THE RISE OF THE HOUSE OF <I>K</I>&Acirc;U TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE KINGDOM THROUGH THE FAVOUR OF GOD, THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF KINGS TH&Acirc;I AND <I>K</I>&Icirc;, AND ESPECIALLY OF KING W&#258;N.</h4>  
<p>Great is God, Beholding this lower world in majesty. He surveyed the four quarters (of the kingdom), Seeking for some one to give establishment to the people. Those two earlier dynasties&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_529"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Had failed to satisfy him with their government; So, throughout the various states, He sought and considered For one on whom he might confer the rule. Hating all the great states, He turned his kind regards on the west, And there gave a settlement (to king Th&acirc;i).</p>  
<p>(King Th&acirc;i) raised up and removed The dead trunks and the fallen trees. He dressed and regulated The bushy clumps and the (tangled) rows. He opened up and cleared The tamarisk trees and the stave trees. He hewed and thinned The mountain mulberry trees. God having brought about the removal thither of this intelligent ruler, The Kwan hordes fled away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Heaven had raised up a helpmeet for him, And the appointment he had received was made sure.</p>  
<p>God surveyed the hills, Where the oaks and the buckthorn were thinned, And paths made through the firs and cypresses. God, who had raised the</p>

<p>state, raised up a proper ruler&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> for it,--From the time of Th&acirc;i-po and king <I>K</I>&icirc; (this was done)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now this king <I>K</I>&icirc; In his heart was full of brotherly duty. Full of duty to his elder brother, He gave himself the more to promote the prosperity (of the country), And secured to him the glory (of his act)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. He accepted his dignity and did not lose it, And (ere long his family) possessed the whole kingdom.</p>  
<p>This king <I>K</I>&icirc; Was gifted by God with the power of judgment, So that the fame of his virtue silently grew. His virtue was highly intelligent,--Highly intelligent, and of rare discrimination; Able to lead, able to rule, To rule over this great country; Rendering a cordial submission, effecting a cordial union&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. When (the sway) came to king W&#259;n, His</p>

<p>virtue left nothing to be dissatisfied with, He received the blessing of God, And it was extended to his descendants.</p>  
<p>God said to king W&#259;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, 'Be not like those who reject this and cling to that; Be not like those who are ruled by their likings and desires;' So he grandly ascended before others to the height (of virtue). The people of M&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_536"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> were disobedient, Daring to oppose our great country, And invaded Y&uuml;an, marching to Kung&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_537"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. The king rose, majestic in his wrath; He marshalled his troops, To stop the invading foes; To consolidate the prosperity of <I>K</I>&acirc;u; To meet the expectations of all under heaven.</p>  
<p>He remained quietly in the capital, But (his troops) went on from the borders of Y&uuml;an. They ascended our lofty ridges, And (the enemy) arrayed no forces on our hills, On our hills, small or large, Nor drank at our springs, Our springs or our pools. He then determined the finest of the plains, And settled on the south of <I>Kh</I>&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_538"></A><A HREF="#fn_519"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, On the banks of</p>

<p>the Wei, The centre of all the states, The resort of the lower people.</p>  
<p>God said to king W&#259;n, 'I am pleased with your intelligent virtue, Not loudly proclaimed nor pourtrayed, Without extravagance or changeableness, Without consciousness of effort on your part, In accordance with the pattern of God.' God said to king W&#259;n, 'Take measures against the country of your foes. Along with your brethren, Get ready your scaling ladders, And your engines of onfall and assault, To attack the walls of <I>Kh</I>ung&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_520"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>The engines of onfall and assault were (at first) gently plied, Against the walls of <I>Kh</I>ung high <A HREF="errata.htm#0">and</A> great; Captives for the question were brought in, one after another; The left ears (of the slain) were taken leisurely&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_540"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

<p>submission, And throughout the region none had dared to insult him. The engines of onfall and assault were (then) vigorously plied, Against the walls of <I>Kh</I>ung very strong. He attacked it, and let loose all his forces; He extinguished (its sacrifices)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_542"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and made an end of its existence; And throughout the kingdom none dared to oppose him.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_511"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_529">389:1</A> Those of Hsi&acirc; and Shang.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_512"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_530">389:2</A> The same as 'the hordes of the Khw&#259;n' in ode 3. Mr. T. W. Kingsmill says that 'Kwan' here should be 'Chun,' and charges the transliteration Kwan with error (journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for April, 1878). He had not consulted his dictionary for the proper pronunciation of the Chinese character.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_513"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_532">390:1</A> King W&#259;n is 'the proper ruler' intended here, and the next line intimates that this was determined before there was any likelihood of his becoming the ruler even of the territory of <I>K</I>&acirc;u;--another instance of the foreseeing providence ascribed to God. Th&acirc;i-po was the eldest son of king Thai, and king <I>K</I>&icirc; was, perhaps, only the third. The succession ought to have come to Thai-po; but he, seeing the sage virtues of <I>Kh</I>ang (afterwards king W&#259;n), the son of <I>K</I>&icirc;, and seeing also that king Thai was anxious that this boy should ultimately become ruler of <I>K</I>&acirc;u, voluntarily withdrew from <I>K</I>&acirc;u altogether, and left the state to <I>K</I>&icirc; and his son. See the remark of Confucius on Th&acirc;i-po's conduct, in the Analects, VIII, i.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_514"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_533">390:2</A> <I>T</I>he lines from six to ten speak of king <I>K</I>&icirc; in his relation to his elder brother. He accepted Th&acirc;i-po's act without any failure of his own duty to him, and by his own improvement of it, made his brother more glorious through it. His feeling of brotherly duty was simply the natural instinct of his heart. Having accepted the act, it only made him the more anxious to promote the good of the state, and thus he made his brother more glorious by showing what advantages accrued from his resignation and withdrawal from <I>K</I>&acirc;u.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_515"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_534">390:3</A> This line refers to K&icirc;'s maintenance of his own loyal duty <A NAME="page_391"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 391</FONT></A> to the dynasty of Shang, and his making all the states under his presidency loyal also.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_516"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_535">391:1</A> The statement that 'God spake to king W&#259;n,' repeated in stanza 7, vexes the Chinese critics, and they find in it simply an intimation that W&#259;n's conduct was 'in accordance with the will of Heaven.' I am not prepared to object to that view of the meaning; but it is plain that the writer, in giving such a form to his meaning, must have conceived of God as a personal Being, knowing men's hearts, and able to influence them.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_517"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_536">391:2</A> M&icirc; or M&icirc;-hs&uuml; was a state in the present King-ning K&acirc;u, of Phing-liang department, Kan-s&ucirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_518"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_537">391:3</A> Y&uuml;an was a state adjacent to M&icirc;,--the present <I>K</I>ing <I>K</I>&acirc;u, and Kung must have been a place or district in it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_519"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_538">391:4</A> W&#259;n, it appears, made now a small change in the site of his capital, but did not move to F&#259;ng, where he finally settled.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_520"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_539">392:1</A> <I>Kh</I>ung was a state, in the present district of H&ucirc;, department Hs&icirc;-an, Shen-hs&icirc;. His conquest of <I>Kh</I>ung was an important event in the history of king W&#259;n. He moved his capital to it, advancing so much farther towards the east, nearer to the domain of-Shang. According to Sze-m&acirc; <I>Kh</I>ien the marquis of <I>Kh</I>ung had slandered the lord of <I>K</I>&acirc;u, who was president of the states of the west, to <I>K</I>&acirc;u-hsin, the king of Shang, and our hero was put in prison. His friends succeeded in effecting his deliverance by means of various gifts to the tyrant, and he was reinstated In the west with more than his former power. Three years afterwards he attacked the marquis of <I>Kh</I>ung.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_521"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_540">392:2</A> So far the siege was prosecuted slowly and, so to say, tenderly, Wan hoping that the enemy would be induced to surrender without great sacrifice of life.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_522"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_541">392:3</A> The sacrifice to God had been offered in ,K&acirc;u, at the commencement of the expedition; that to the Father of War, on the army's arriving at the borders of ,Khung. We can hardly tell who is intended by the Father of War. <I>K</I>&ucirc; Hs&icirc; and others would require the plural 'Fathers,' saying the sacrifice was to Hwang T&icirc; and <I>Kh</I>ih Y&ucirc;, who are found engaged in hostilities far back in the <A NAME="page_393"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 393</FONT></A> mythical period of Chinese history. But <I>Kh</I>ih Y&ucirc; appears as a rebel, or opposed to the One man in all the country who was then fit to rule. It is difficult to imagine how they could be associated, and sacrificed to together.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_523"></A><A HREF="sbe03133.htm#fr_542">393:1</A> The extinction of its sacrifices was the final act in the extinction of a state. Any members of its ruling House who might survive could no longer sacrifice to their ancestors as having been men of princely dignity. The family was reduced to the ranks of the people.</P>
