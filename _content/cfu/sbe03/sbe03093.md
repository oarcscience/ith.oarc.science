##### ODE 4. THE HSIÂO PÎ.

##### KING *KH*ĂNG ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE HAD ERRED, AND STATES HIS PURPOSE TO HE CAREFUL IN THE FUTURE; HE WILL GUARD AGAINST THE SLIGHT BEGINNINGS OF EVIL; AND IS PENETRATED WITH A SENSE OF HIS OWN INCOMPETENCIES.

This piece has been considered by some critics as the conclusion of the
council in the ancestral temple, with which the previous two also are
thought to be connected. The Preface says that the king asks in it for
the assistance of his ministers, but no such request is expressed. I
seem myself to see in it, with Sû *Kh*eh and others, a reference to the
suspicions which *Kh*ăng at one time, we know, entertained of the
fidelity of the duke of *K*âu, when he was inclined to believe the
rumours spread against him by his other uncles, who joined in rebellion
with the son of the last king of Shang.

I condemn myself (for the past), And will be on my guard against future
calamity. I will have nothing to do with a wasp, To seek for myself its
painful sting. At first indeed it seemed to be

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (but) a wren <span

bird. I am unequal to the many difficulties of the kingdom, And am
placed in the midst of bitter experiences.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_366"></span>[331:1](sbe03093.htm#fr_379) The Chinese
characters here mean, literally, 'peach-tree insect,' or, as Dr.
Williams has it, 'peach-bug.' Another name for the bird is 'the clever
wife,' from the artistic character of its nest, which would point it out
as the small 'tailor bird.' But the name is applied to various small
birds.
