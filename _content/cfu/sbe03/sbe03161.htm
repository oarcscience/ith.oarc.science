<p>THIS piece, it is said, was made by Kung <I>K</I>iang, the widow of Kung-po, son of the marquis Hs&icirc; of Wei (B.C. 855-814). Kung-po having died an early death, her parents (who must have been the marquis of <I>Kh</I>&icirc; and his wife or one of the ladies of his harem) wanted to force her to a second marriage, against which she protests. The ode was preserved, no doubt, as an example of</p>

<p>It floats about, that boat of cypress wood, There by the side of the Ho. With his two tufts of hair falling over his forehead, He was my only one; And I swear that till death I will not do the evil thing. O mother, O Heaven, Why will you not understand me?</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_600"></A><A HREF="sbe03161.htm#fr_620">435:1</A> These allusive lines, probably, indicate the speaker's widowhood, Which left her like 'a boat floating about on the water.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_601"></A><A HREF="sbe03161.htm#fr_621">435:2</A> Such was the mode in which the hair was kept, while a boy or young man's parents were alive, parted into two tufts from the pia mater, and brought down as low as the eyebrows on either side of the forehead.</P>

There seems rather to be in the term a wild, and not very intelligent, appeal to the supreme Power in heaven.</P>
