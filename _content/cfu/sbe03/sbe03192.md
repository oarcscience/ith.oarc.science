## CHAPTER XII. AMPLIFICATION OF 'THE ALL-EMBRACING RULE OF CONDUCT' IN CHAPTER I.

The Master said, 'For teaching the people to be affectionate and loving
there is nothing better than Filial Piety; for teaching them (the
observance of) propriety and submissiveness there is nothing better than
Fraternal Duty; for changing their manners

<span id="page_482">p. 482</span>

and altering their customs there is nothing better than Music; for
securing the repose of superiors and the good order of the people there
is nothing better than the Rules of Propriety.

'The Rules of Propriety are simply (the development of) the principle of
Reverence. Therefore the reverence paid to a father makes (all) sons
pleased; the reverence paid to an elder brother makes (all) younger
brothers pleased; the reverence paid to a ruler makes (all) subjects
pleased <span id="fr_687"></span>[1](#fn_667). The reverence paid to one
man makes thousands and myriads of men pleased. The reverence is paid to
a few, and the pleasure extends to many;--this is what is meant by an
"All-embracing Rule of Conduct."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_667"></span>[482:1](sbe03192.htm#fr_687) We must understand
that the 'reverence' here is to be understood as paid by the sovereign.
In reverencing his father (or an uncle may also in Chinese usage be so
styled), he reverences the idea of fatherhood, and being 'in accord with
the minds of all under heaven,' his example is universally powerful. And
we may reason similarly of the other two cases of reverence specified.
