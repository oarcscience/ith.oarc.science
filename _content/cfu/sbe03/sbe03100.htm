</p>  <h5 align="center">ODE 11. THE PAN.</h5>  <h5 align="center">CELEBRATING THE GREATNESS OF <I>K</I>&Acirc;U, AND ITS FIRM POSSESSION OF THE KINGDOM, AS SEEN IN THE PROGRESSES OF ITS REIGNING SOVEREIGN.</h5>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">In the eighth piece of the first decade we have an ode akin to this, relating a tentative progress of king W&ucirc;, to test the acceptance of his sovereignty. This is of a later date, and should be referred, probably, to the reign of king <I>Kh</I>&#259;ng, when the dynasty was fully acknowledged. Some critics, however, make it, like the three preceding, a portion of what was sung at the W&ucirc; dance.</FONT></p>  
<p>Oh! great now is K&acirc;u. We ascend the high hills, Both those that are long and narrow, and the lofty mountains. Yes, and (we travel) along the regulated Ho, All under the sky, Assembling those who now respond to me. Thus it is that the appointment belongs to <I>K</I>&acirc;u.</p>
