### The Seventh Decade, or that of Sang Hû.

#### ODE 1, STANZA 1. THE SANG HÛ.

#### THE KING, ENTERTAINING THE CHIEF AMONG THE FEUDAL PRINCES, EXPRESSES HIS ADMIRATION OF THEM, AND GOOD WISHES FOR THEM.

They flit about, the greenbeaks <span id="fr_477"></span>[4](#fn_461),
With their

variegated wings, To be rejoiced in are these princes! May they receive
the blessing of Heaven <span id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_462)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_461"></span>[373:4](sbe03124.htm#fr_477) The greenbeaks
appeared in the second ode of the fifth decade. The bird had many names,
and a beautiful plumage, <span id="page_374">p. 374</span> made use of
here to compliment the princes on the elegance of their manners, and
perhaps also the splendour of their equipages. The bird is here called
the 'mulberry Hû,' because it appeared when the mulberry tree was coming
into leaf.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[374:1](sbe03124.htm#fr_478) This line is to be
understood, with *K*û Hsî, as a prayer of the king to Heaven for his
lords.
