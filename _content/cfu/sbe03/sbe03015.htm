<p><FONT SIZE="-1">This Book ranks in that class of the documents of the Sh&ucirc; which goes by the name of 'Instructions.' Though the form of it be poetical, the subject-matter is derived from the Lessons left by Y&uuml; for the guidance of his posterity.</p>  
<p>Th&acirc;i Khang succeeded to his father in B.C. 2188, and his reign continues in chronology to 2160. His character is given here in the introductory chapter. Khiung, the principality of &Icirc; who took the field against him, is identified with the sub-department of T&ecirc;-<I>K</I>&acirc;u, department <I>K</I>&icirc;-nan, Shan-tung. There is a tradition that &Icirc;, at an early period of his life, was lord of a state in the present Ho-nan. This would make his movement against Th&acirc;i Khang, 'south of the Ho,' more easy for him. The name of Th&acirc;i Khang remains in the district so called of the department <I>Kh</I>&#259;n-<I>k</I>&acirc;u, Ho-nan. There, it is said, he died, having never been able to recross the Ho.</p>  
<p>In his song the king's first brother deplores how he had lost the affections of the people; the second speaks of his dissolute extravagance; the third mourns his loss of the throne; the fourth deplores his departure from the principles of Y&uuml;, and its disastrous consequences; and the fifth is a wail over the miserable condition of them all.</FONT></p>  
<p>1. Th&acirc;i Khang occupied the throne like a personator of the dead&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. By idleness and dissipation he extinguished his virtue, till the black-haired people all wavered in their allegiance. He, however, pursued his pleasure and wanderings without any</p>

<p>self-restraint. He went out to hunt beyond the Lo, and a hundred days elapsed without his returning. (On this) &Icirc;, the prince of <I>Kh</I>iung, taking advantage of the discontent of the people, resisted (his return) on (the south of) the Ho. The (king's) five brothers had attended their mother in following him, and were waiting for him on the north of the Lo; and (when they heard of &Icirc;'s movement), all full of dissatisfaction, they related the Cautions of the great Y&uuml; in the form of songs.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>2. The first said,</p>  
<p><DIR>It was the lesson of our great ancestor:--<br> The people should be cherished,<br> And not looked down upon.<br> The people are the root of a country;<br> The root firm, the country is tranquil.<br> When I look at all under heaven,<br> Of the simple men and simple women,<br> Any one may surpass me.<br> If the One man err repeatedly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,<br> Should dissatisfaction be waited for till it appears?<br> Before it is seen, it should be guarded against.<br> In my dealing with the millions of the people,<br> I should feel as much anxiety as if I were driving six horses with rotten reins.<br> The ruler of men--<br> How should he be but reverent (of his duties)?'</p>  
<p>The second said,<br> It is in the Lessons:--<br> When the palace is a wild of lust,<br> And the country is a wild for hunting; <A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A><br> When spirits are liked, and music is the delight;<br> When there are lofty roofs and carved walls;--<br> The existence of any one of these things<br> Has never been but the prelude to ruin.'</p>  
<p>The third said,<br> 'There was. the lord of Th&acirc;o and Thang&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Who possessed this region of <I>K</I>&icirc;.<br> Now we have fallen from his ways,<br> And thrown into confusion his rules and laws;--<br> The consequence is extinction and ruin.'</p>  
<p>The fourth said,<br> Brightly intelligent was our ancestor,<br> Sovereign of the myriad regions.<br> He had canons, he had patterns,<br> Which he transmitted to his posterity.<br> The standard stone and the equalizing quarter<br> Were in the royal treasury.<br> Wildly have we dropt the clue he gave us,<br> Overturning our temple, and extinguishing our sacrifices.'*</p>  
<p>The fifth said,<br> 'Oh! whither shall we turn?<br> The thoughts in my breast make me sad<br> All the people are hostile to us;<br> On whom can we rely?<br> Anxieties crowd together in our hearts;<br> Thick as are our faces, they are covered with blushes.<br> We have not been careful of our virtue;<br> And though we repent, we cannot over-take the past.'</DIR></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_87"></A><A HREF="sbe03015.htm#fr_91">78:1</A> The character that here as a verb governs the character signifying 'throne' means properly 'a corpse,' and is often used for the personator of the dead, in the sacrificial services to the dead which formed a large part of the religious ceremonies of the ancient Chinese. A common definition of it is 'the semblance of the spirit,' = the image into which the spirit entered. Th&acirc;i Khang was but a personator on the throne, no better than a sham sovereign.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_88"></A><A HREF="sbe03015.htm#fr_92">79:1</A> Any king, in the person of Y&uuml;, may be understood to be the speaker.</P>
