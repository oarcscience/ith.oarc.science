#### ODE 4. THE *ZH*ÂI PIN.

#### CELEBRATING THE DILIGENCE AND REVERENCE OF THE YOUNG WIFE OF AN OFFICER, DOING HER PART IN SACRIFICIAL OFFERINGS.

She gathers the large duckweed, By the banks of the stream in the
southern valley. She gathers the pondweed, In those pools left by the
floods.

She deposits what she gathers, In her square baskets and round ones. She
boils it, In her tripods and pans.

She sets forth her preparations, Under the window in the ancestral
chamber <span id="fr_618"></span>[1](#fn_598). Who superintends the
business? It is (this) reverent young lady.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_598"></span>[432:1](sbe03157.htm#fr_618) 'The ancestral
chamber' was a room behind the temple of the family, dedicated specially
to the ancestor of the officer whose wife is the subject of the piece.
The princes of states were succeeded, as a rule, by the eldest son of
the wife proper. Their sons by other wives were called 'other sons.' The
eldest son by the wife proper of one of them became the 'great ancestor'
of the clan descended from him, and 'the ancestral chamber' was an
apartment dedicated to him. Mâo and other interpreters, going on certain
statements as to the training of daughters in the business of
sacrificing in this apartment for three months previous to their
marriage, contend that the lady spoken of here was not yet married, but
was only undergoing this preparatory education. It is not necessary,
however, to adopt this interpretation. The lady appears doing the same
duties as the wife in the former piece.
