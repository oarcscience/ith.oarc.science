<p>IT has been said on the title of Book iii, that Wei at first was the eastern portion of the old domain of the kings of Shang. With this a brother of king W&ucirc;, called Khang-sh&ucirc;, was invested. The principality was afterwards increased by the absorption of Phei and Yung. It came to embrace portions of the present provinces of <I>K</I>ih-l&icirc;, Shan-tung, and Ho-nan. It outlasted the dynasty of <I>K</I>&acirc;u itself, the last prince of Wei being reduced to the ranks of the people only during the dynasty of <I>Kh</I>in.</p>
