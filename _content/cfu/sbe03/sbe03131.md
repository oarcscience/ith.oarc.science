#### ODE 5. THE HAN LÛ.

#### IN PRAISE OF THE VIRTUE OF KING WĂN, BLESSED BY HIS ANCESTORS, AND RAISED TO THE HIGHEST DIGNITY WITHOUT' SEEKING OF HIS OWN.

Look at the foot of the Han <span id="fr_517"></span>[3](#fn_500), How
abundantly grow the hazel and arrow-thorn <span
id="fr_518"></span>[4](#fn_501). Easy and self-possessed was our prince,
In his pursuit of dignity (still) easy and self-possessed.

Massive is that libation-cup of jade, With the

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

yellow liquid sparkling in it <span id="fr_519"></span>[1](#fn_502).
Easy and self-possessed was our prince, The fit recipient of blessing
and dignity.

The hawk flies up to heaven, The fishes leap in the deep <span
id="fr_520"></span>[2](#fn_503). Easy and self-possessed was our
prince:--Did he not exert an influence on men?

His clear spirits were in the vessels; His red bull was ready <span
id="fr_521"></span>[3](#fn_504);--To offer, to sacrifice, To increase
his bright happiness.

Thick grow the oaks and the buckthorn, Which the people use for
fuel <span id="fr_522"></span>[4](#fn_505). Easy and self-possessed was
our prince, Cheered and encouraged by the spirits <span
id="fr_523"></span>[4](#fn_505).

Luxuriant are the dolichos and other creepers, Clinging to the branches
and stems. Easy and self-possessed was our prince, Seeking for happiness
by no crooked ways.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_500"></span>[386:3](sbe03131.htm#fr_517) Where mount Han
was cannot now be determined.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[386:4](sbe03131.htm#fr_518) As the foot of the
hill was favourable to vegetable growth, so were king Wăn's natural
qualities to his distinction and advancement.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[387:1](sbe03131.htm#fr_519) As a cup of such
quality was the proper receptacle for the yellow, herb-flavoured
spirits, so was the character of Wăn such that all blessing must accrue
to him.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[387:2](sbe03131.htm#fr_520) It is the nature
of the hawk to fly and of fishes to swim, and so there went out an
influence from Wăn unconsciously to himself.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[387:3](sbe03131.htm#fr_521) Red, we have seen,
was the proper colour for victims in the ancestral temple of *K*âu.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[387:4](sbe03131.htm#fr_523) As it was natural
for the people to take the wood and use it, so it was natural for the
spirits of his ancestors, and spiritual beings generally, to bless king
Wăn.
