##### ODE 5. THE YÛ KÛ.

##### THE BLIND MUSICIANS OF THE COURT OF *K*ÂU; THE INSTRUMENT OF MUSIC; AND THEIR HARMONY.

The critics agree in holding that this piece was made on occasion of the
duke of *K*âu's completing his instruments of music for the ancestral,
temple, and announcing the fact at a grand performance in the temple of
king Wăn. It cam hardly be regarded as a sacrificial ode.

There are the blind musicians; there are the blind musicians; In the
court of (the temple of) *K*âu. <span id="fr_372"></span>[1](#fn_359)

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

There are (the music-frames with their) face-boards and posts, The high
toothed-edge (of the former), and the feathers stuck (in the latter);
With the drums, large and small, suspended from them; And the hand-drums
and sounding-stones, the instrument to give the signal for commencing,
and the stopper. These being all complete, the music is struck up. The
pan-pipe and the double flute begin at the same time <span
id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_360).

Harmoniously blend their sounds; In solemn unison they give forth their
notes. Our ancestors will give ear. Our visitors will be there;--Long to
witness the complete performance.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_359"></span>[323:1](sbe03084.htm#fr_372) The blind
musicians at the court of *K*âu were numerous. The blindness of the eyes
was supposed to make the ears more acute in hearing, and to be
favourable to the powers of the voice. In the Official Book of *K*âu,
III, i, par. 22, the enumeration of <span id="page_234">p. 234</span>
these blind musicians gives 2 directors of the first rank, and 4 of the
second; 40 performers of the first grade, 100 of the second, and 160 of
the third; with 300 assistants who were possessed of vision. But it is
difficult not to be somewhat incredulous as to this great collection of
blind musicians about the court of *K*âu.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[324:1](sbe03084.htm#fr_373) All the
instruments here enumerated were performed on in the open court below
the hall. Nothing is said of the stringed instruments which were used in
the hall itself; nor is the enumeration of the instruments in the
courtyard complete.
