<p>Let me be reverent! Let me be reverent! (The way of) Heaven is evident, And its appointment</p>

<p>is not easily preserved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Let me not say that it is high aloft above me. It ascends and descends about our doings; It daily inspects us wherever we are.</p>  
<p>I am a little child, Without intelligence to be reverently (attentive to my duties); But by daily progress and monthly advance, I will learn to hold fast the gleams (of knowledge), till I arrive at bright intelligence. Assist me to bear the burden (of my position), And show me how to display a virtuous conduct.</p>
