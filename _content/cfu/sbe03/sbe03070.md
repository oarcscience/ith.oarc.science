### II. THE SACRIFICIAL ODES OF KÂU.

IN this division we have thirty-one sacrificial odes of *K*âu, arranged
in three decades, the third of which, however, contains eleven pieces.
They belong mostly to the time of king Wăn, the founder of the *K*âu
dynasty, and to the reigns of his son and grandson, kings Wû and
*Kh*ăng. The decades are named from the name of the first piece in each.

#### The First Decade, or that of *Kh*ing Miâo.

##### ODE 1. The *Kh*ing Miâo.

##### CELEBRATING THE REVERENTIAL MANNER IN WHICH A SACRIFICE TO KING WĂN WAS PERFORMED, AND FURTHER PRAISING HIM.

Chinese critics agree in assigning this piece to the sacrifice mentioned
in the Shû, in the end of the thirteenth Book of Part V, when, the
building of Lo being finished, king *Kh*ăng came to

the new city, and offered a red bull to Wăn, and the same to Wû. It
seems to me to have been sung in honour of Wăn, after the service was
completed. This determination of the occasion of the piece being
accepted, we should refer it to B.C. 1108.

Oh! solemn is the ancestral temple in its pure stillness. Reverent and
harmonious were the distinguished assistants <span

officers <span id="fr_358"></span>[2](#fn_346):--(All) assiduous
followers of the virtue of (king Wăn). In response to him in heaven,
Grandly they hurried about in the temple. Distinguished is he and
honoured, And will never be wearied of among men.

service.
