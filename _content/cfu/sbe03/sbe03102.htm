<p>2. Pleasant is the semicircular water, And we gather the pondweed in it. The marquis of L&ucirc; has come to it, With his horses so stately. His horses are grand; His fame is brilliant. Blandly he looks and smiles; Without any impatience he delivers his instructions.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_371"></A><A HREF="sbe03102.htm#fr_384">338:1</A> It is said in the tenth ode of the first decade of the Major Odes of the Kingdom, that king W&ucirc; in his capital of H&acirc;o built 'his hall with its circlet of water.' That was the royal college built in the middle of a circle of water; each state had its grand college with a semicircular pool in front of it, such is may now be seen in front of the temples of Confucius in the metropolitan cities of the provinces. It is not easy to describe all the purposes which the building served. In this piece the marquis of L&ucirc; appears feasting in it, delivering instructions, taking counsel with his ministers, and receiving the spoils and prisoners of war. The L&icirc; <I>K</I>&icirc;, VIII, ii, 7, refers to sacrifices to H&acirc;u-<I>k</I>&icirc; in connexion with the college of L&ucirc;. There the officers of the state in autumn learned ceremonies; in winter, literary studies; in spring and summer, the use of arms; and in autumn and winter, dancing. There were celebrated trials of archery; there the aged were feasted; there the princes held council with their ministers. The college was in the western suburb of each capital.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_372"></A><A HREF="sbe03102.htm#fr_385">339:1</A> The meaning is that the fine qualities of the marquis 'reached to' and affected his ancestors in their spirit-state, and would draw down their protecting favour. Their blessing, seen in his prosperity, was the natural result of his filial piety.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_373"></A><A HREF="sbe03102.htm#fr_386">339:2</A> The Hw&acirc;i rises in the department of Nan-yang, Ho-nan, and flows eastward to the sea. South of it, down to the time of this ode, were many rude and wild tribes that gave frequent occupation to the kings of <I>K</I>&acirc;u.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_374"></A><A HREF="sbe03102.htm#fr_387">339:3</A> When prisoners refused to submit, their left ears were cut off, and shown as trophies.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_375"></A><A HREF="sbe03102.htm#fr_388">339:4</A> The ancient Shun's Minister of Crime. The 'examiners' were officers. who questioned the prisoners, especially the more important of them, to elicit information, and decide as to the amount of their guilt and punishment.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_376"></A><A HREF="sbe03102.htm#fr_389">340:1</A> The 'judges' decided all questions of dispute in the army, and on the merits of different men who had distinguished themselves.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_377"></A><A HREF="sbe03102.htm#fr_390">340:2</A> In this stanza the poet describes a battle with the wild tribes, as if it were going on before his eyes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_378"></A><A HREF="sbe03102.htm#fr_391">340:3</A> An owl is a bird with a disagreeable scream, instead of a beautiful note; but the mulberries grown about the college would make them sing delightfully. And so would the influence of L&ucirc;, going forth from the college, transform the nature of the tribes about the Hw&acirc;i.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_379"></A><A HREF="sbe03102.htm#fr_392">340:4</A> That is, according to 'the Tribute of Y&uuml;,' in the Sh&ucirc;, from <I>K</I>ing-<I>k</I>&acirc;u and Yang-<I>k</I>&acirc;u.</P>
