<p><FONT SIZE="-1">This account of the piece, given in the Preface, is variously corroborated, and has not been called in question by any critic. Perhaps this brief ode was sung as a prelude to the dance, or it may be that the seven lines are only a fragment. This, indeed, is most likely, as we have several odes in the next decade, all said to have been used at the same occasion.</FONT></p>  
<p>Oh! great wast thou, O king W&ucirc;, Displaying the utmost strength in thy work. Truly accomplished was king W&#259;n, Opening the path for his successors. Thou didst receive the inheritance from him. Thou didst vanquish Yin, and put a stop to its cruelties;--Effecting the firm establishment of thy merit.</p>
