<P><A NAME="fn_524"></A><A HREF="sbe03134.htm#fr_543">393:2</A> 'The three sovereigns,' or 'wise kings,' are to be understood of the three celebrated in ode 7,--Th&acirc;i, K&icirc;, and Wan. We are thus obliged, with all Chinese scholars, to understand this ode of king W&ucirc;. The statement that 'the three kings were in heaven' is very express.</P>
