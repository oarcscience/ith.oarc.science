#### ODE 9. THE HSIÂ WÛ.

#### IN PRAISE OF KING WÛ, WALKING IN THE WAYS OF HIS FOREFATHERS, AND BY HIS FILIAL PIETY SECURING THE THRONE TO HIMSELF AND HIS POSTERITY.

Successors tread in the steps (of their predecessors) in our *K*âu. For
generations there had been wise kings; The three sovereigns were in
heaven <span id="fr_543"></span>[2](#fn_524); And king (Wû) was their
worthy successor in his capital <span id="fr_544"></span>[3](#fn_525).

King (Wû) was their worthy successor in his capital, Rousing himself to
seek for the hereditary virtue, Always striving to be in accordance with
the

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

will (of Heaven); And thus he secured the confidence due to a king.

He secured the confidence due to a king, And became the pattern of all
below him. Ever thinking how to be filial, His filial mind was the model
(which he supplied).

Men loved him, the One man, And responded (to his example) with a docile
virtue. Ever thinking how to be filial, He brilliantly continued the
doings (of his fathers).

Brilliantly! and his posterity, Continuing to walk in the steps of their
forefathers, For myriads of years, Will receive the blessing of Heaven.

They will receive the blessing of Heaven, And from the four quarters (of
the kingdom) will felicitations come to them. For myriads of years Will
there not be their helpers?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_524"></span>[393:2](sbe03134.htm#fr_543) 'The three
sovereigns,' or 'wise kings,' are to be understood of the three
celebrated in ode 7,--Thâi, Kî, and Wan. We are thus obliged, with all
Chinese scholars, to understand this ode of king Wû. The statement that
'the three kings were in heaven' is very express.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[393:3](sbe03134.htm#fr_544) The capital here
is Hâo, to which Wû removed in B.C. 1134, the year after his father's
death. It was on the east of the river Făng, and only about eight miles
from Wăn's capital of Făng.
