<p>THE state of <I>Kh</I>in took its name from its earliest principal city, in the present district of <I>Kh</I>ing-shui, in <I>Kh</I>in <I>K</I>&acirc;u, Kan-s&ucirc;. Its chiefs claimed to be descended from Y&icirc;, who appears in the Sh&ucirc; as the forester of Shun, and the assistant of the great Y&uuml; in his labours on the flood of Y&acirc;o. The history of his descendants is very imperfectly related till we come to a Fei-&#541;ze, who had charge of the herds of horses belonging to king Hsi&acirc;o (B.C. 90989.5), and in consequence of his good services. was invested with</p>

<p>the small territory of <I>Kh</I>in, as an attached state. A descendant of his, known as duke Hsiang, in consequence of his loyal services, when the capital was moved to the east in B.C. 770, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and took his place among the great feudal princes of the kingdom, receiving also a large portion of territory, which included the ancient capital of the House of <I>K</I>&acirc;u. In course of time <I>Kh</I>in, as is well known, superseded the dynasty of <I>K</I>&acirc;u, having gradually moved its capital more and more to the east. The people of <I>Kh</I>in were, no doubt, mainly composed of the wild tribes of the west.</p>
