</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">BOOK II. THE ODES OF SH&Acirc;O AND THE SOUTH.</h3>  
<p>THE Sh&ucirc; and previous portions of the Shih have made us familiar with Sh&acirc;o, the name of the appanage of Shih, one of the principal ministers at the court of <I>K</I>&acirc;u in the first two reigns of the dynasty. The site of the city of Sh&acirc;o was in the present department of F&#259;ng-<I>kh</I>iang, Shen-hs&icirc;. The first possessor of it, along with the still more famous duke of <I>K</I>&acirc;u, remained at court, to watch over the fortunes of the new dynasty. They were known as 'the highest dukes' and 'the two great chiefs,' the duke of <I>K</I>&acirc;u having charge of the eastern portions of the kingdom, and the other of the western. The pieces in this Book are supposed to have been produced in Sh&acirc;o, and the principalities south of it within his jurisdiction, by the duke.</p>
