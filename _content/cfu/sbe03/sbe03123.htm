<p>Large are the fields, and various is the work to be done. Having selected the seed, and looked after the implements, So that all preparations have been made for our labour, We take our sharp ploughshares, And commence on the south-lying acres. We sow all the kinds of grain, Which grow up straight and large, So that the wish of the distant descendant is satisfied.</p>

We remove the insects that eat the heart and the leaf, And those that eat the roots and the joints, So that they shall not hurt the young plants of our fields. May the spirit, the Father of Husbandry&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_473"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, Lay hold of them, and put them in the blazing fire!</p>

<p>The distant descendant will come, When their wives and children Are bringing food to those (at work) on the south-lying acres. The surveyor of the fields (also) will come and be glad. They will come and offer pure sacrifices to (the spirits of the four) quarters, With their victims red and black&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, With their preparations of millet:--Thus offering, thus sacrificing, Thus increasing our bright happiness.</p>
