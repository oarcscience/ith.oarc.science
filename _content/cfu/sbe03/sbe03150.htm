</p>  <h4 align="center">ODE 7, STANZAS 1 AND PART OF 3. THE HAN Y&Icirc;.</h4>  <h4>CELEBRATING THE MARQUIS OF HAN:--HIS INVESTITURE, AND THE KING'S CHARGE TO HIM; THE GIFTS HE RECEIVED, AND THE PARTING FEAST AT THE COURT; HIS MARRIAGE; THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS TERRITORY; AND HIS SWAY OVER THE REGIONS OF THE NORTH.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Only one line--the first of stanza 3--in this interesting piece serves to illustrate the religious practices of the time, and needs no further note than what has been given on the first line of stanza 7 in the preceding ode. The name of the marquisate of Han remains in the district of Han-<I>kh</I>&#259;ng, department of Hs&icirc;-an, Shen-hs&icirc;, in which also is mount Liang.</FONT></p>  
<p>Very grand is the mountain of Liang, Which was made cultivable by Y&uuml;. Bright is the way from it, (Along which came) the marquis of Han to receive investiture. The king in person gave the charge:--'Continue the services of your ancestors; Let not my charge to you come to nought. Be diligent early and late, And reverently discharge your duties:--So shall my appointment of you not change. Be a support against those princes who do not come to court, Thus assisting your sovereign.'</p>  
<p>When the marquis of Han left the court, he sacrificed to the spirit of the road. He went forth, and lodged for the night in T&ucirc;.</p>
