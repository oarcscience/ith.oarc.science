## CHAPTER XVII. THE SERVICE OF THE RULER.

The Master said, 'The superior man <span id="fr_696"></span>[3](#fn_676)
serves his ruler in such a way, that when at court in his presence his
thought is how to discharge his loyal duty to the utmost; and when he
retires from it, his thought is how to amend his errors. He carries out
with deference the measures springing from his excellent qualities, and
rectifies him (only) to save him from what are evil. Hence, as the
superior and inferior, they are able to have an affection for each
other.

It is said in the Book of Poetry <span id="fr_697"></span>[4](#fn_677),

"In my heart I love him;  
And why should I not say so?  
In the core of my heart I keep him,  
And never will forget him."'
