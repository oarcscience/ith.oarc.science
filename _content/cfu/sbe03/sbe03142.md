#### ODE 9, STANZA 1. THE MIN LÂO.

#### IN A TIME OF DISORDER AND SUFFERING, SOME OFFICER OF, DISTINCTION CALLS ON HIS FELLOWS TO JOIN WITH HIM TO EFFECT A REFORMATION IN THE CAPITAL, AND PUT AWAY THE PARTIES WHO WERE THE CAUSE OF THE PREVAILING MISERY.

With the *Kh*üan Â, what are called the 'correct' odes of Part III, or
those belonging to a period of good government, and the composition of
which is ascribed mainly to the duke of *K*âu, come to an end; and those
that follow are the 'changed' Major Odes of the Kingdom, or those
belonging to a degenerate period, commencing with this. Some among them,
however, are equal to any of the former class. The Min Lâo has been
assigned to duke Mû of Shâo, a descendant of duke Khang, the Shih of the
Shû, the reputed author of the *Kh*üan Â, and was directed against king
Lî, B.C. 878 to 828.

The people indeed are heavily burdened, But perhaps a little relief may
be got for them. Let us cherish this centre of the kingdom, To secure
the repose of the four quarters of it. Let us give no indulgence to the
wily and obsequious, In order to make the unconscientious careful, And
to repress robbers and oppressors, Who have no fear of the clear will
(of Heaven) <span id="fr_569"></span>[1](#fn_549). Then let us show
kindness to those who are distant, And help those who are near,--Thus
establishing (the throne of) our king.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_549"></span>[407:1](sbe03142.htm#fr_569) 'The clear will,'
according to *K*û Hsî, is 'the clear appointment of Heaven;' according
to *K*û Kung-*kh*ien, 'correct principle.' They both mean the law of
human duty, as gathered from the nature of man's moral constitution
conferred by Heaven.
