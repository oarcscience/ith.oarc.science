##### ODE 4. THE FĂNG NIEN.

##### AN ODE OF THANKSGIVING FOR A PLENTIFUL YEAR.

The Preface says the piece was used at sacrifices in autumn and winter.
*K*û Hsî calls it an ode of thanksgiving for a good year,--without any
specification of time. He supposes, however, that the thanks were given
to the ancient Shăn-năng, 'the father of Agriculture,' Hâu-*k*î, 'the
first Husbandman,' and the spirits presiding over the four quarters of
the heavens. To this the imperial editors rightly demur, saying that the
blessings which the piece speaks of could come only from God.

Abundant is the year with much millet and much rice And we have our high
granaries, With myriads, and hundreds of thousands, and millions (of
measures in them); For spirits and sweet spirits, To present to our
forefathers, male and female, And to supply all our ceremonies. The
blessings sent down on us are of every kind.
