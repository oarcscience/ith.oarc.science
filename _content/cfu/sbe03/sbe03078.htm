<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The Chinese critics differ in the interpretation of this ode, the Preface and older scholars restricting it to a sacrifice to king W&ucirc;, while <I>K</I>&ucirc; Hs&icirc; and others find reference in it, as to me also seems most natural, to <I>Kh</I>&#259;ng and Khang, who succeeded him.</FONT></p>  
<p>The arm of king W&ucirc; was full of strength; Irresistible was his ardour. Greatly illustrious were <I>Kh</I>&#259;ng and Khang&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, Kinged by God.</p>  
<p>When we consider how <I>Kh</I>&#259;ng and Khang Grandly held all within the four quarters (of the kingdom), How penetrating was their intelligence!</p>  
<p>The bells and drums sound in harmony; The sounding-stones and flutes blend their notes; Abundant blessing is sent down.</p>  
<p>Blessing is sent down in large measure. Careful and exact is all our deportment; We have drunk, and we have eaten, to the fall; Our happiness and dignity will be prolonged.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_353"></A><A HREF="sbe03078.htm#fr_365">319:1</A> If the whole piece be understood only of a sacrifice to W&ucirc;, this line will have to be translated--'How illustrious was he, who completed (his great work), and secured its tranquillity.' We must deal similarly with the next line. This construction is very forced; nor is the text clear on the view of <I>K</I>&ucirc; Hs&icirc;.</P>
