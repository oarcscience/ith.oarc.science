##### ODE 5. THE THIEN ȜO.

##### APPROPRIATE TO A SACRIFICE TO KING THÂI.

We cannot tell what the sacrifice was; and the Preface, indeed, says
that the piece was used in the seasonal sacrifices to all the former
king., s and dukes of the House of *K*âu. King Thâi was the grandfather
of king Wăn, and, before he received that title, was known as 'the
ancient duke Than-fû.' In B.C. 1327, he moved with his followers from
Pin, an earlier seat of his House, and settled in the plain of *Kh*î,
about fifty lî to the north-east of the present district city of
*Kh*î-shan, in Shen-hsî.

Heaven made the lofty hill <span id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_348), And
king Thâi brought (the country about) it under cultivation. He made the
commencement with it, And king Wăn tranquilly (carried on the work),
(Till) that rugged (mount) *Kh*î Had level roads leading to it. May
their descendants ever preserve it!
