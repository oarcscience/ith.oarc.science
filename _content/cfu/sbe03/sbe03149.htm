<P><A NAME="fn_588"></A><A HREF="sbe03149.htm#fr_608">425:1</A> We get an idea of the meaning which has been attached to these four lines from a very early time by Mencius' quotation of them (VI, i, ch. 6) in support of his doctrine of the goodness of human nature, and the remark on the piece which he attributes to Confucius, that 'the maker of it knew indeed the constitution (of our nature).' Every faculty, bodily or mental, has its function to fulfil, and every relationship its duty to be discharged. The function and the duty are the things which the human being has to observe:--the seeing clearly, for instance, with the eyes, and bearing distinctly with the ears; the maintenance of righteousness between ruler and minister, and of affection between parent and child. This is the 'normal nature,' and the 'normal virtue' is the nature fulfilling the various laws of its constitution.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_589"></A><A HREF="sbe03149.htm#fr_609">425:2</A> The connexion between these four lines and those that precede is this:--that while Heaven produces all men with the good nature there described, on occasions it produces others with virtue and powers in a super-eminent degree. Such an occasion was presented by the case of king Hs&uuml;an, and therefore, to mark its appreciation of him, and for his help,, it now produced <I>K</I>ung Shan-f&ucirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_590"></A><A HREF="sbe03149.htm#fr_610">425:3</A> This was a special sacrifice at the commencement of a journey, or of an expedition. See note 2 on <A HREF="sbe03136.htm#page_399">p. 399</A>.</P>
