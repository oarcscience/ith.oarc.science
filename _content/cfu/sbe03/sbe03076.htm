</p>  <h5 align="center">ODE 7. THE W&Ucirc; KIANG.</h5>  <h5 align="center">APPROPRIATE TO A SACRIFICE TO KING W&#258;N, ASSOCIATED WITH HEAVEN, IN THE HALL OF AUDIENCE.</h5>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">There is, happily, an agreement among the critics as to the occasion to which this piece is referred. It took place in the last month of autumn, in the Hall of Audience, called also 'the Brilliant Hall,' and 'the Hall of Light.' We must suppose that the princes are all assembled at court, and that the king receives them in this hall. A sacrifice is then presented to God, with him is associated king W&#259;n, and the two being the fountain from which, and the channel through which, the sovereignty had come to K&acirc;u.</FONT></p>  
<p>I have brought my offerings, A ram and a bull. May Heaven accept them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!</p>  
<p>I imitate and follow and observe the statutes of king W&#259;n, Seeking daily to secure the tranquillity of the kingdom. King W&#259;n, the Blesser, has descended on the right, and accepted (the offerings).</p>  
<p>Do I not, night and day, Revere the majesty of Heaven, Thus to preserve (its favour).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_350"></A><A HREF="sbe03076.htm#fr_362">317:1</A> This is a prayer. The worshipper, it is in view of the majesty of Heaven, shrank from assuming that God would certainly accept his sacrifice. He assumes, below, that king W&#259;n does so.</P>
