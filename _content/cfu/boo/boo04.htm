<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">You</span> came&#8212;a simple lad<br> In dark blue cotton clad,<br> To barter serge for silken wear;<br> But not for silk you dallied there.<br> Ah! was it not for me<br> Who led you through the K&#8217;e,<br> Who guided you<br> To far Tun-K&#8217;ew?<br> "It is not I who would put off the day;<br> But you have none your cause to plead,"<br> I said,&#8212;"O love, take heed,<br> When the leaves fall do with me what you may."</p>  
<p>I saw the red leaves fall,<br> And climbed the ruined wall,<br> Towards the city of Fuh-kwan<br> I did the dim horizon scan.<br> "He cometh not," I said,<br> And burning tears were shed:<br> You came&#8212;I smiled,<br> Love&#8212;reconciled,<br> You said, "By taper reed and tortoise-shell,<br> I have divined, and all, O love, is well."</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> "Then haste the car," I cried,<br> "Gather my goods and take me to thy side."</p>  
<p>Before the mulberry tree<br> With leaves hath strewn the lea,<br> How glossy-green are they! how rare!<br> Ah! thou young thoughtless dove beware!<br> Avoid the dark fruit rife<br> With sorrow to thy life.<br> And thou, whose fence<br> Is innocence,<br> Seek no sweet pleasuring with any youth!<br> For when a man hath sinned, but little shame<br> Is fastened to his name,<br> Yet erring woman wears the garb of ruth.</p>  
<p>When the lone mulberry tree<br> With leaves bestrews the lea,<br> They yellow slowly, slowly down<br> From green to gold, from gold to brown.<br> Three sombre years ago<br> I fled with you, and lo,<br> The floods of K&#8217;e<br> Now silently<br> Creep to the curtains of my little car.<br> Through cloud and gloom I was your constant<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;star;<br> Now you have gone from sight,<br> And love's white star roams aimless through<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the night.</p>  
<p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> For three long years your wife,<br> Toil was my part in life,<br> Early from sleep I rose and went<br> About my labour, calm, content;<br> Nor any morn serene<br> Lightened the dull routine.<br> Early and late,<br> I was your mate,<br> Bearing the burdens that were yours to share.<br> Fain of the little love that was my lot,<br> Ah, kinsmen scorn me not!<br> How should ye know when silence chills despair?</p>  
<p>Old we should grow in accord,<br> Old&#8212;and grief is my lord.<br> Between her banks the K&#8217;e doth steer,<br> And pine-woods ring the lonely mere.<br> In pleasant times I bound<br> My dark hair to the sound<br> Of whispered vows<br> &#8217;Neath lilac boughs,<br> And little recked o&#8217;er broken faith to weep.<br> Now the grey shadows o&#8217;er the marshland creep:<br> The willows stir and fret:<br> Low in the west the dull dun sun hath set.</p>
