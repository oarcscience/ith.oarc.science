### *BRAVE THOUGHTS*

<span class="smallcaps">Green</span> is the upper robe,  
Green with a yellow lining;  
My sorrow none may probe,  
Nor can I cease repining.

Green is the upper robe,  
The lower garb is yellow;  
My sorrow none may probe,  
Nor any season mellow.

The silk was of emerald dye,  
Ah! this was all your doing;  
But I dream of an age gone by  
To keep my heart from rueing.

Fine linen or coarse, ’tis cold,  
But all I have to dress me;  
So I think of the men of old,  
And find brave thoughts possess me.
