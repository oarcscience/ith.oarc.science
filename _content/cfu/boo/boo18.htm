<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span> has perched in the valley with pines over-grown,<br> This fellow so stout and so merry and free;<br> He sleeps and he talks and he wanders alone,<br> And none are so true to their pleasures as he.</p>  
<p>He has builded his hut in the bend of the mound,<br> This fellow so fine with his satisfied air;<br> He wakes and he sings with no neighbour around,<br> And whatever betide him his home will be there.</p>  
<p>He dwells on a height amid cloudland and rain,<br> This fellow so grand whom the world blunders by;<br> He slumbers alone, wakes, and slumbers again,<br> And his secrets are safe in that valley of Wei.</p>
