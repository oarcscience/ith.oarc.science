<p><FONT SIZE="-1">1. A tone of thankfulness continues. As if in gratitude for better fortunes, the prophet declares that he will bestow upon Ahura with the foremost, according to the measure of the gifts (which he has received. Those gifts were the secured Immortality not mere temporal 'deathlessness'), the Righteous Order, and the Sovereign Power established in holiness and bestowing the Universal Weal.</p>  
<p>2. The kind of gifts which are proposed for offerings are not sacrificial beasts or fruits, but the actions of the truly pious citizen whose soul is intimately united with Righteousness, the homage of prayer, and the songs of praise. As no piety could exist without strict ecclesiastical regularity, so no ceremonial punctuality was conceived of apart from honour and charity (see verse 5 and Ya<I>s</I>t XXII).</p>  
<p>3. Accordingly the meat-offering, the mention of which immediately follows, is spoken of as offered with homage to the Righteous Order and to the Divine Sovereignty for the benefit of all the sacred settlements, in order to equip the wise man fully, and as a helpful blessing among the Immortals themselves and their adherents.</p>  
<p>4. And the Fire is likewise mentioned, which was worshipped not so much like Agni as the friendly god of the hearth and the altar, but more and chiefly like Agni as the priest of the church.</p>  
<p>Not unlike Agni, it is called upon both for inward spiritual strength and for temporal blessings in various forms, together with vengeance hurled very much as if in the form of a thunderbolt (zast&acirc;-i<I>s</I>t&acirc;i<I>s</I> dere<I>s</I>t&acirc;-a&ecirc;nanghem). 5. To explain what he means by his supplications for the coming of the Kingdom, and for holy actions (that is, to make it certain that he does not mean punctilious ritualism apart from the noblest charity), he rhetorically asks: &#8216;And what is Your Kingdom, that which Zarathu<I>s</I>tra establishes and offers to You? (XXXIII, 14). What is the kind of prayer (comp. XLVIII, 8, and LIII, 1) which I must use, so that I may become Yours (Your property) in my actions, not to load Your priesthood with sacrifices, nor to fatten Your princes with booty (as too often in the <I>Ri</I>ks), nor yet to secure a heavy gift to the poet, but to 'nourish Your poor?' This was the essence of the desired Sanctity and the Sovereign Authority. The Kingdom of God, exalted</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">and personified as a separate intelligence, is positively said to be something more than a gaudy pageant of material display, even Tav&acirc; Khshathrem y&acirc; ere<I>z</I>i<I>g</I>y&ocirc;i d&acirc;h&icirc; drigav&ecirc; vahy&ocirc; (LIII, 9). (See also even Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d II [part i], where moral duties are lauded.)</p>  
<p>And the composer himself seems to be so conscious of the sharply defined difference between such a kingdom and that of the rival religion, that he immediately adds an interdict: 'Such is Your Kingdom, caring for the righteous poor, and therefore we declare You irreconcilably distinct from the Da&ecirc;vas and their polluted followers. Ye are beyond them and before in the spirit of Your Reign!'</p>  
<p>6. He then utters an impressive doubt, which only deepens our admiration at his expressions of faith: 'If it be really true,' he continues (see XLIV, 6), 'that Ye are thus with the Righteous Order and the Good Mind, the God who looks upon the goodness of the heart and the activity of the hands, then give me a sign of it, that I may persevere and increase in the depth of my homage while life shall last.' 7. For the struggle, though not without signs of a favourable issue, was far from over yet. (Hence his misgivings.)</p>  
<p>He then asks with some wistfulness after the 'ar(e)dr&acirc;,' the men that could help, who from the experience of the grace of God, could turn sorrow into blessing by establishing the holy religious system firmly, but with enlarged and not narrowed understanding. And, still a little dispirited, he declares, as so often: 'None have I other than You; therefore I can wait for the ar(e)dr&acirc;. Do ye save us alone by Your already offered means of grace.'</p>  
<p>8. 'For Ye have given me already, as it were, a sign. The enemy are checked, and for the moment cowed, if they are not repelled. They among whom there was death for so many when they had the upper hand, and when their ruler persecuted the holy vows are not only struck with terror by the action which we take, but their chief retribution is, as we hold it, spiritual, and therefore, in the eye of truth the more severe. They will not encourage righteous Order and righteous intentions, and accordingly, the personified Good Intention, grieved, will depart from them.'</p>  
<p>9. 'Yea,' he reiterates, amplifying, 'the unfortunate sinners who depart from Thy kindly and sacred Piety in this ignorance of all experience of Thy Good Mind, will suffer an equal desertion. The characteristics of righteousness will, in their turn, avoid them as the unclean creatures flee from us.' 10. 'And this is,' thus he continues, 'a sign or result which the All-wise declares to me to steady my soul as I waver.' 'And these are indeed the cheering proofs of Thy favour,' he adds, addressing Ahura, 'which terrify our enemies</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">and advance us, giving us a righteous eminence (XXXIII, 14) in Thy Kingdom.'</p>  
<p>11. 'Therefore that kindly Piety whom these desert in their judicial ignorance, will increase for us both the all-comprehensive blessings; spiritual Deathlessness begun in anticipation here, and its necessary condition, Welfare. And they shall be increased as food (sic) for Mazda's straitened people, or better, to His glory as their monarch. And by their means Ahura may defend Himself efficiently from the persecuting and idolatrous foe.' 12. Taking into consideration all that depends on a correct understanding as to religious and political duties, he fervently prays to be guided aright in the establishment of a ceremonial and of praises, beseeching Mazda to speak, declaring the kind of worship which may secure the ashis (which are the blessed rewards). And he asks to be taught those religious paths about which no error was possible, the paths which are the Good Mind's own.</p>  
<p>13. After a fashion already known to us (as in XXIX), he answers his question himself. That way which Ahura had already revealed as the Good Mind's own, was made up of the revealed precepts of the Saoshya<I>n</I>ts. There, as in the paths where Ahura dwells (XXXIII, 5; XLVI, 16), the well-doer may prosper from his devotion to the religious truths, and gain a reward immediately from the hand of God. 14. As if never forgetting the original calamity, the woes of the Kine, he further declares that way to be the one of all to be chosen for this earthly life, as the vestibule to the heavenly one. And he asserts that they who toil for the Kine (who represents here, as generally, the holy settlements as well as their chief source of riches and support) are striving to further and demonstrate the wisdom of that way by every righteous contrivance.</p>  
<p>Nay, he declares that the deeds of Piety are themselves the highest wisdom, just as the words and righteous actions of the Saoshya<I>n</I>ts not only declare and make, but constitute, 'the way.'</p>  
<p>15. Again, concluding with a climacteric and synoptical prayer, he beseeches Ahura to speak and reveal to him all the most available statements, ceremonies, and praises. And never forgetting that all ceremonies, hymns, and sacrifices, sacred as they are, are only means to a greater end; he prays the Deity that He may exert that Sovereign Power which is alone supremely efficient in relieving actual distress (LIII, 9), for by its holy laws and spiritual arms it can alone bring on the Frashakar<I>d</I>, and produce that condition in society in which all human progress shall have become complete.</FONT></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_413"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_414">84:3</A> Or, 'for as those justly acting, and in preparation will we offer it as a blessing together with all who are among "Your own."' Here khshm&acirc;va<I>n</I>t equals 'Your own'; rather than 'Yourselves.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_414"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_415">84:4</A> Or 'visible' as fire, but this seems too feeble a conception for the place. The Pahlavi translator read dere<I>s</I>t&acirc; as a participle from dar(e)z, which is quite as possible as that it should be from dar(e)s. He renders yakhsenun&ecirc;<I>d</I> k&icirc;n&#335;; Ner., vidadh&acirc;ti nigraham. That he so translated because he was not aware that dere<I>s</I>t&acirc; could be also a participle from dar(e)s, is no longer tenable.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_415"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_416">84:5</A> As by no means a partially selected specimen, let the reader <A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A> consider the following from the Pahlavi: Thus, O A&ucirc;harmazd! this which is Thy Fire, which is so powerful, is a satisfaction to him whose is Ahar&acirc;y&icirc;h [-when my chieftain (the glossist seeming to have a text with a first pronoun; otherwise the first translator who never saw? us(e)mah&icirc;) becomes one by whom duty and charity are fulfilled], for it is quick and powerful [the Fire], and remains continually in friendship with him, and makes joy manifest to him. And therefore, O A&ucirc;harmazd I on him who is the tormentor it takes revenge as if with a mighty wish.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_416"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_417">85:1</A> Ka<I>t</I> is often a mere interrogative particle, so modern interrogatives are also often merely formal.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_417"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_418">85:2</A> Bartholomae admirably follows K4 here with its hakhm&icirc;; it gives a more common explanation of v&acirc;o, which I am obliged to take in a possessive sense beside n<I>e</I>. The manuscript used by the Pahlavi writer had, however, ahm&icirc;, as many others now extant.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_418"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_419">85:3</A> Note the recurrence of this care for the poor, showing what the frequent mention of righteousness, the good mind, &amp;c. meant.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_419"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_420">85:4</A> Observe that da&ecirc;v&acirc;i<I>s</I> must mean the Demon-gods and not their worshippers here; par<I>e</I> v&acirc;o indicates this, and also mashy&acirc;i<I>s</I> = men, who are separately mentioned. The Pahlavi translator is finely critical here, giving us our first hint as to the meaning: P&ecirc;sh Lek&ucirc;m min harvisp-g&ucirc;n&#335; lev&icirc;n&#335; g&ucirc;ft h&ocirc;man&ecirc;<I>d</I> [a&icirc;gh t&ucirc;b&acirc;nkar<I>d</I>ar h&ocirc;man&ecirc;<I>d</I>, &amp;c.]. So with antare-mr&ucirc;y&ecirc; (-v&ecirc;), he was the pioneer also. I render with impartiality: Which (of what kind) is your sovereignty? [that is, what thing can I do, whereby your sovereignty may be increased through my instrumentality?] And which is your wealth? [that is, what thing shall I do whereby riches may be kept in your possession by my means?] How thus in the actions of A&ucirc;harmazd shall I become yours? [That is, I (?) shall do that thing through which, by my means, your sovereignty is extended; and also wealth is kept in your possession by me.] For whenever I (?) shall do righteous deeds, [that is, when I (?) shall do duty and good works], Voh&ucirc;man gives nourishment to our poor. Before all of every kind, even before them ye are <A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A> declared; [that is, ye are more capable] than the demons, for their (?) intellect is perverted, (and ye are also before) men.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_420"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_421">86:1</A> So also the Pahlavi dakh<I>s</I>ak.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_421"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_422">86:2</A> So indicated by ketr&ucirc;n&acirc;n&icirc;. I have no doubt whatever that ma&ecirc;th&acirc; should have this sense. See also Y. XXX, 9.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_422"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_423">86:3</A> So also the Pahlavi: Pavan &acirc;fr&icirc;nag&acirc;n&#335; dahi<I>s</I>n&#335; va st&acirc;yi<I>s</I>n&#335; s&acirc;t&ucirc;nam madam.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_423"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_424">86:4</A> Urv&acirc;idy&acirc;o, if in its original form, looks like a comparative. One naturally thinks of a *vr&acirc;d (?) equivalent to 'v<I>ri</I>dh.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_424"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_425">86:5</A> Rhetorically interrogative as often in English, or indeed a mere particle. (Compare XLVI, 9.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_425"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_426">86:6</A> So also the Pahlavi indicates with its &acirc;m&ucirc;khti<I>s</I>n&#335; (sic) &icirc; h&ucirc;vari<I>s</I>n&#335; [&icirc; av&#335; k&acirc;r va kirfak], m&ucirc;ni<I>k</I> pavan &acirc;s&acirc;n&icirc;h va m&ucirc;ni<I>k</I> pavan tang&icirc;h v&acirc;d&ucirc;ny&ecirc;n fr&acirc;kh-hush&icirc;h. Ner.: <I>S</I>iksh&acirc;m satyiya ya<I>h</I> sam&acirc;dh&acirc;natve, sa<I>m</I>ka<I>t</I>atve* &#8217;pi kurute vipula<I>k</I>aitanya<I>h</I> [kila, ya<I>h</I> k&acirc;rya<I>m</I> pu<I>n</I>ya<I>m</I> yat sam<I>ri</I>ddhatay&acirc; kurute] ta<I>k</I><I>k</I>a yat sa<I>m</I>ka<I>t</I>atay&acirc; &#8217;pi kurute, tasya vi<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;na<I>k</I>aitanya<I>m</I> tasm&acirc;d bhavati.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_426"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_427">86:7</A> N&acirc;o being taken in a possessive sense.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_427"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_428">86:8</A> But the Pahlavi has: 'Min zak &icirc; valman<I>s</I>&acirc;n maman k&ucirc;ni<I>s</I>n&#335; lanman b&icirc;m'; possibly 'by these actions they terrify us'; the middle in the sense of the active.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_428"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_429">87:1</A> It is a mistake to suppose that the Pahlavi translator and his followers, Ner. and the Persian MS. (of Haug's Collection), refer n&acirc;idy<I>a</I>unghem and nade<I>n</I>t&ocirc; to the same Sanskrit word. They translate them as if referring the first to n&acirc;dh, and the last to nid.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_429"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_430">87:2</A> Min valman<I>s</I>&acirc;n bar&acirc; rakh&icirc;k a&icirc;t&#335; Voh&ucirc;man. Asman&ocirc; seems an impossible reading, and cannot be reconciled with Voh&ucirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_430"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_431">87:3</A> The hint of the Pahlavi points, as usual, to the general sense, leaving us the task of discovering the grammatical structure.</p>  
<p>Here I do not follow the indication of sedk&ucirc;ny&ecirc;n; Ner. parikshipyanti. The voc. 'O Thou' is free.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_431"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_432">87:4</A> So also in general the Pahlavi: Min valman<I>s</I>&acirc;n kabed Ahar&acirc;y&icirc;h se<I>g</I>dak; Ner. tebhya<I>h</I>* prabhuto dharma<I>h</I>* prabhra<I>s</I>yati.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_432"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_433">87:5</A> So if ahma<I>t</I> is read, but the MS. before the Pahlavi translator read ahm&acirc;t; Ner. etebhya<I>h</I> (freely). A simpler rendering results; 'as from him flee away.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_433"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_434">87:6</A> Observe the evidence of the Zend to the prevalent meaning of 'khratu.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_434"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_435">87:7</A> Or reading hith&atilde;n, and in the sense of 'bond,' we coincide with Ner. sukhaniv&acirc;sam. Haith&atilde;m = the true; h&acirc;t&atilde;m? = of beings. Lit. 'the true creatrix of Asha (the holy).'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_435"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_436">88:1</A> The word voyathr&acirc; is difficult to place; the Pahlavi translator divided, reading &acirc;vo-yathr&acirc; (possibly &acirc;voi athr&acirc;), and rendered fr&ocirc;<I>d</I> k&ucirc;sh&icirc;-a&icirc;t = is smitten down; the Persian better: Fr&ocirc;d zadar, is smiting down. We may well hesitate before rejecting this indication, which may point to a better text. Like vafu<I>s</I>, it may indicate the severity of the influences of the righteous system, in the midst of genial allusion. The t&acirc; v&icirc;sp&acirc; might refer quite naturally to du<I>s</I>-<I>s</I>kayasthan&acirc; in the previous verse. The form voyathr&acirc; (corrected) may represent some derivative from the root b&icirc; = to fear. Compare bya<I>n</I>t&ecirc; in verse 8.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_436"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_437">88:2</A> So likewise the Pahlavi with its kh&ucirc;ri<I>s</I>n&#335;; otherwise 'for glory;' <I>h</I><I>v</I>ar = svar. Lit. 'To Thee (are) both Weal and Immortality.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_437"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_438">88:3</A> <I>G</I>av&icirc;<I>d</I> b&ecirc;sh min lak h&ocirc;manih; Ner. v&icirc;takash<I>t</I>as tva<I>m</I> asi.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_444"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_445">89:3</A> Observe the certainty of a subtle meaning, 'the way <i>is</i> the consciences or laws.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_445"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_446">89:4</A> Geldner has admirably suggested a comparison with vra<I>g</I> on account of the connection 'way.' But as this necessitates two urv&acirc;z = vr&acirc;z, and as Ahura is spoken of as 'dwelling' in 'paths,' I do not think that 'thriving in paths' is very difficult. The prominent thought is not the going, but the 'right going.' That path indicates a reward (so also the Pahlavi <I>k</I>&acirc;sh&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;, Ner. &acirc;sv&acirc;daya<I>h</I>). But we must be thankful for the keen and vigorous discussion. Compare urv&acirc;khshanguha g&acirc;ya <I>g</I>igha&ecirc;<I>s</I>a. The Pahlavi has h&ucirc;-rav&acirc;kh-man&icirc;h and in Y. XLIV, 8. If vra<I>g</I> is compared, the idea must be happy progress; but varh (Justi) seems the more obvious correspondent.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_446"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_447">89:5</A> Asha, very often personified, is a stronger expression than 'correctly:</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_448"></A><A HREF="sbe31012.htm#fr_449">90:1</A> Or the 'mature,' 'drivable' (?) cow. She 'goes on her path' of toil.</P>
