### VISPARAD XX (SP. XXIII) <span id="fr_1511"></span>[3](#fn_1494).

1\. (Homage to the Gâtha Vohu-khshathra <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[4](#fn_1495)! We sacrifice to the Vohu-khshathra),
(the good kingdom) even the Khshathra-vairya, the kingdom to be desired;
and we sacrifice to the iron-founding <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[5](#fn_1496), and to the (sacrificial) words <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[6](#fn_1497) correctly spoken which smite (the foe)
with victory, and which hold the Daêvas subject.

And we worship that reward and that health, that healing and that
progress, that growth and that victorious smiting <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[7](#fn_1498) (2) which are between the
Vohu-khshathra and the Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti <span
id="fr_1516"></span>[8](#fn_1499), (and which are acquired by us) by the
memorised recital of the good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, for
the withstanding of evil thoughts, and words, and deeds; yea, for the
undoing of all treacherous thoughts (directed) against me, and of all
false words, and unfair deeds. 3. \[And we sacrifice to the later Yasna,
the heroic Haptanghâiti <span id="fr_1517"></span>[9](#fn_1500), (and
which as it recurs becomes) the holy ritual chief.\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1494"></span>[361:3](sbe31097.htm#fr_1511) This piece from
the later Avesta follows Y. LI, in the Vendîdâd Sâdah.

<span id="fn_1495"></span>[361:4](sbe31097.htm#fr_1512) From the
Vendîdâd Sâdah.

<span id="fn_1496"></span>[361:5](sbe31097.htm#fr_1513) Associated with
this Gâtha from Y. LI, 9.

<span id="fn_1497"></span>[361:6](sbe31097.htm#fr_1514) Compare Y. LI,
3.

<span id="fn_1498"></span>[361:7](sbe31097.htm#fr_1515) Y. LI, 9; also
perhaps Y. LIII, 8, 9.

<span id="fn_1499"></span>[361:8](sbe31097.htm#fr_1516) Between; that
is, described in the space between the Vohu-khshathra and the
Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti, i.e. in Y. LII. See hamist*e*ê in Y. LII, 4, and
paiti*s*tât*e*ê in Visp. XX, 2.

<span id="fn_1500"></span>[361:9](sbe31097.htm#fr_1517) This would seem
misplaced; perhaps Y. XLII is meant, which follows the Haptanghâiti.
