<p>(As the Ah&ucirc; is excellent, so (is) the Ratu (one who rules) from the righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness and of life's actions done for Mazda; and</p>

<p>the Kingdom (is) for Ahura which to the poor shall offer a nurturer.)</p>  
<p>1. Zarathu<I>s</I>tra asked of Ahura Mazda: O Ahura Mazda, Thou most bounteous Spirit! maker&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1102"></A><A HREF="#fn_1093"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the corporeal worlds, the holy One! which was that word which Thou did&#8217;st declare to me, (2) which was before the sky, and before the water, before the earth, and before the cattle, before the plants, and before the fire, and before the holy man, and the Demon-gods (the Da&ecirc;vas), before the Khrafstra-men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1103"></A><A HREF="#fn_1094"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and before all the incarnate world; even before all the good creatures made by Mazda, and which contain (and are) the seed of righteousness?</p>  
<p>3. Thereupon Ahura Mazda said: It was this piece&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1104"></A><A HREF="#fn_1095"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the Ahuna-vairya, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! which I pronounced as thine (4) before the sky, and before the waters, before the land, and before the cattle and the plants, and before the fire, Ahura Mazda's son, before the holy man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1105"></A><A HREF="#fn_1096"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and before the Da&ecirc;vas, and Khrafstra-men, and before the entire corporeal world, even before the good creatures made by Mazda, which contain (and are) the seed of righteousness.</p>

<p>6. And whoever in this world of mine which is corporeal shall mentally recall, O Spit&acirc;ma* Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! a portion of the Ahuna-vairya, and having thus recalled it, shall undertone it, or beginning to recite it with the undertone, shall then utter it aloud, or chanting it with intoning voice, shall worship thus, then with even threefold (safety and with speed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1107"></A><A HREF="#fn_1098"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>) I will bring his soul over the Bridge of <I>K</I>inva<I>t</I>, I who am Ahura Mazda (I will help him to pass over it) to Heaven (the best life), and to Righteousness the Best, and to the lights of heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1108"></A><A HREF="#fn_1099"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>7. And whoever, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! while undertoning the part(s) of the Ahuna-vairya (or this piece the Ahuna-vairya), takes ought therefrom, whether the half, or the third, or the fourth, or the fifth, I who am Ahura Mazda will draw his soul off</p>

<p>8. And I pronounced this saying which contains its Ah&ucirc; and its Ratu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1111"></A><A HREF="#fn_1102"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> before the creation of this heaven, before the making of the waters, and the plants, and the four-footed kine, before the birth of the holy biped man, before this sun with its body made for the acquisition of the creation of the Bountiful Immortals&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1112"></A><A HREF="#fn_1103"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>9. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1113"></A><A HREF="#fn_1104"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>And the more bountiful&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1114"></A><A HREF="#fn_1105"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> of the two Spirits (Ahura) declared to me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1115"></A><A HREF="#fn_1106"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> (Zarathu<I>s</I>tra) the entire creation of the pure, that which exists at present, that which is in the course of emerging into existence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1116"></A><A HREF="#fn_1107"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, and that which shall be, with reference to the performance and realisation 'of the actions of a life devoted to Mazda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1117"></A><A HREF="#fn_1108"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>10. And this word is the most emphatic of the words which have ever been pronounced, or which are&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1118"></A><A HREF="#fn_1109"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> now spoken, or which shall be spoken in future; for (the eminence of) this utterance is a thing of such a nature, that if all the corporeal and living world</p>

<p>should learn it, and learning should hold fast by it, they would be redeemed from their mortality!</p>  
<p>11. And this our word I have proclaimed as a symbol to be learned&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1119"></A><A HREF="#fn_1110"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and to be recited, as it were, to every one of the beings under the influence of and for the sake of Righteousness the Best.</p>  
<p>12. And 'as' (the worshipper has) here spoken it forth, when he has thus 'appointed' the 'Lord and regulator&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1120"></A><A HREF="#fn_1111"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,' so (by thus reciting these authoritative words), he acknowledges Ahura Mazda (as prior to, and supreme) over, those creatures who have 'the mind'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1121"></A><A HREF="#fn_1112"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> as their first. 'As' he acknowledges Him as the greatest of them all, 'so' he assigns the creatures to Him (as to their originator).</p>  
<p>13. As he undertones the third sentence, he thereby announces that &#8216;all the amenities of life appertain to the 'good' Mazda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1122"></A><A HREF="#fn_1113"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, (and come) from Him. As he recites 'dazda manangh&ocirc;,' 'the creator of mind,' he acknowledges Him as superior and prior to mind; and as he makes Him the one who indicates (the truth) to mind, (saying) 'manangh&ocirc; of mind,' which means that by this much he makes Him (its director), and then he makes Him 'the lord of actions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1123"></A><A HREF="#fn_1114"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.'</p>

<p>their ruler) when he assigns the creatures to Him thus. He then assigns the Kingdom to Ahura&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1125"></A><A HREF="#fn_1116"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, saying: 'Thine, O Mazda! is the Kingdom.' And he assigns a nourisher and protector to the poor, saying: Yim driguby&ocirc; dada<I>t</I> v&acirc;st&acirc;rem; that is, as a friend to Spitama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1126"></A><A HREF="#fn_1117"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. This is the fifth sentence, (and it concludes) the entire recital and word, (even) the whole of this word of Ahura Mazda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1127"></A><A HREF="#fn_1118"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>15. He who is the best (of all) Ahura Mazda, pronounced the Ahuna-vairya, and as He pronounced it as the best, so He caused it to have its effect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1128"></A><A HREF="#fn_1119"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, (He, ever) the same, (as He is).</p>  
<p>The evil one at once&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1129"></A><A HREF="#fn_1120"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> arose (to oppose Him), but He (Ahura) repelled that wicked one with His interdict, and with this repelling renunciation: Neither our minds are in harmony, nor our precepts, nor our comprehensions, nor our beliefs, nor our words, nor our actions, nor our consciences, nor our souls&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1130"></A><A HREF="#fn_1121"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>!</p>

<p>16. And this saying, uttered by Mazda, has three stages, or measures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1132"></A><A HREF="#fn_1123"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, and belongs to four classes (of men as its supporters), and to five chiefs (in the political world, without whom its efficiency is</p>

<p>marred), and it has a conclusion ending with a gift. (Question.) How are its measures (constituted)? (Answer.) The good thought, the good word, and the good deed. 17. (Question.) With what classes of men? (Answer.) The priest, the charioteer (as the chief of warriors), the systematic tiller&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1133"></A><A HREF="#fn_1124"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the ground, and the artisan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1134"></A><A HREF="#fn_1125"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. These classes therefore accompany the religious man throughout his entire duty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1135"></A><A HREF="#fn_1126"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with the correct thought, the truthful word, and the righteous action. These are the classes and states in life which give attention to the rulers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1136"></A><A HREF="#fn_1127"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and fulfil the (laws) of religion; (yea, they are the guides and companions of that religious man) through whose actions the settlements are furthered in righteousness.</p>  
<p>18. (Question.) How are the chiefs (constituted)? (Answer.) They are the house-chief, the village-chief, and the tribe-chief, the chief of the province, and the Zarathu<I>s</I>tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1137"></A><A HREF="#fn_1128"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> as the fifth. That is, so far as those provinces are concerned which are different from, and outside of the Zarathu<I>s</I>trian regency, or domain. [Ragha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1138"></A><A HREF="#fn_1129"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> which has four chiefs (only) is the Zarathu<I>s</I>trian (district)]. (Question.) How are the chiefs of this one constituted? (Answer.) They (are) the house-chief, the village-chief, the tribe-chief, and the Zarathu<I>s</I>tra as the fourth. 19. (Question.) What is the thought well thought? (Answer.) (It is that which the holy man thinks), the one who holds the holy thought to be before all other things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1139"></A><A HREF="#fn_1130"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. (Question.)</p>

It is the M&atilde;thra Spe<I>n</I>ta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1140"></A><A HREF="#fn_1131"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the bounteous word of reason. (Question.) What is the deed well done? (Answer.) It is that done with praises&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1141"></A><A HREF="#fn_1132"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and by the creatures who regard Righteousness as before all other things. 20. (Question.) Mazda made a proclamation, whom did He announce? (Answer.) Some one who was holy, and yet both heavenly and mundane&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1142"></A><A HREF="#fn_1133"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (Question.) What was His character, He who made this sacred enunciation? (Answer.) He who is the best (of all), the ruling one. (Question.) Of what character (did He proclaim him the coming one)? (Answer.) As holy and the best, a ruler who exercises no wanton or despotic power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1143"></A><A HREF="#fn_1134"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>
