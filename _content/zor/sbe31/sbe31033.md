### YASNA XI.

#### PRELUDE TO THE H(A)OMA-OFFERING <span id="fr_1020"></span>[5](#fn_1014).

1\. Three clean creatures (full of blessings) curse betimes while yet
invoking, the cow, the horse, and then H(a)oma. The cow cries to her
driver <span id="fr_1021"></span>[6](#fn_1015) thus:

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Childless be thou,
shorn of offspring, evil-famed, and slander-followed, who foddered <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[1](#fn_1016) fairly dost not use me, but fattenest
me for wife or children, and for thy niggard selfish meal.

2\. The horse cries to his rider thus: Be not spanner <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[2](#fn_1017) of the racers; stretch no coursers to
full-speed; do not stride across the fleetest, thou, who dost not pray
me swiftness in the meeting thick with numbers, in the circuit thronged
with men.

3\. H(a)oma speaks his drinker thus: Childless be thou, shorn of
offspring, evil-famed, and slander-followed, who holdest me from full
outpouring, as a robber, skulls in-crushing. No head-smiter <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[3](#fn_1018) am I ever, holy H(a)oma, far from
death <span id="fr_1025"></span>[4](#fn_1019).

4\. Forth my father gave an offering, tongue and left eye chose Ahura,
set apart for H(a)oma's meal.

5\. Who this offering would deny me, eats himself, or prays it from me,
this which Mazda gave to bless me, tongue with left eye (as my portion).

6\. In his house is born no fire-priest, warrior ne’er in chariot
standing, never more the thrifty tiller. In his home be born Dahâkas,
Mûrakas of evil practice, doing deeds of double nature.

7\. Quick, cut off then H(a)oma's portion, gift of flesh for doughty
H(a)oma! Heed lest H(a)oma

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

bind thee fettered, as he bound the fell Turanian Frangrasyan <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[1](#fn_1020) (the murderous robber) fast in iron
close-surrounded in the mid-third <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[2](#fn_1021) of this earth! 8. Thereupon spake
Zarathu*s*tra <span id="fr_1028"></span>[3](#fn_1022); Praise to H(a)oma
made by Mazda, good is H(a)oma Mazda-made.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

9\.  <span id="fr_1029"></span>[4](#fn_1023)Who to us is one hereupon to
thee (becomes) two, to be made to three, for the five <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[5](#fn_1024)-making of the four, for the
seven-making of the sixth, who are your nine in the decade (?), who
serve you and with zeal <span id="fr_1031"></span>[6](#fn_1025).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

10\.  <span id="fr_1032"></span>[7](#fn_1026)To thee, O holy H(a)oma!
bearer of the ritual sanctity, I offer this my person which is seen (by
all to be) mature, (and fit for gift); to H(a)oma the effective do I
offer it, and to the sacred exhilaration which he bestows; and do thou
grant to me (for this), O holy H(a)oma! thou that drivest death afar,
(Heaven) the best world of the saints, shining, all brilliant.

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

11\. (The Ashem Vohû, &c.)

12-15. May’st Thou rule at Thy will, O Lord <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[1](#fn_1027)!

16\. I confess myself a Mazdayasnian of Zarathu*s*tra's order <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[2](#fn_1028).

17\.  <span id="fr_1035"></span>[3](#fn_1029)I celebrate my praises for
good thoughts, good words, and good deeds for my thoughts, my speeches,
and (my) actions. With chanting praises I present all good thoughts,
good words, and good deeds, and with rejection I repudiate all evil
thoughts, and words, and deeds. 18. Here I give to you, O ye Bountiful
Immortals! sacrifice and homage with the mind, with words, deeds, and my
entire person; yea, (I offer) to you the flesh of my very body (as your
own). And I praise Righteousness. A blessing is Righteousness (called)
the Best, &c.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1014"></span>[244:5](sbe31033.htm#fr_1020) This
characteristic fragment is repeated and extended in the later literature
of the Parsis. The curse of the cow, horse, and of Haoma (scilicet the
priest) when they are stinted, was extended to all domestic animals. It
has been difficult to avoid the full metrical rhythm of the original
with its jingling cadence. A full freedom is also not avoided.

<span id="fn_1015"></span>[244:6](sbe31033.htm#fr_1021) Not 'to the
priest;' Ner. g*ri*hîtâram.

<span id="fn_1016"></span>[245:1](sbe31033.htm#fr_1022) 'Who dost not
give me cooked (food)' seems improbable. If *hv*âstãm means fodder, why
is it fem., especially here with a feminine correlative? I think that
'having good food' is the meaning of the word, as an adjective, and
agreeing with gãm understood. Possibly, 'who dost not bestow upon me as
the one well-foddered.'

<span id="fn_1017"></span>[245:2](sbe31033.htm#fr_1023) Dialectically
used.

<span id="fn_1018"></span>[245:3](sbe31033.htm#fr_1024) 'Light is the
intoxication of Haoma;' (other toxicants smite the head).

<span id="fn_1019"></span>[245:4](sbe31033.htm#fr_1025) 'Having death
afar.'

<span id="fn_1020"></span>[246:1](sbe31033.htm#fr_1026) A Turanian king.

<span id="fn_1021"></span>[246:2](sbe31033.htm#fr_1027) Observe the
threefold division of the earth; see it also in Vend. II.

<span id="fn_1022"></span>[246:3](sbe31033.htm#fr_1028) A poetical
reproduction. Z. had been long among the ancient dead.

<span id="fn_1023"></span>[246:4](sbe31033.htm#fr_1029) The Raspi at
present hands the Haoma-cup to the priest at this point; the efficacy of
the liquor is supposed to be multiplied.

<span id="fn_1024"></span>[246:5](sbe31033.htm#fr_1030) Pe*n*daidyâi is
to be read as of course; the letter <span id="img_24600"></span>
![](img/24600.jpg), not unlike <span id="img_24601"></span>
![](img/24601.jpg) in a MS. when turned, was probably half inverted.

<span id="fn_1025"></span>[246:6](sbe31033.htm#fr_1031) This seems
rendered by the Pahlavi as an interlude between the Ratu and the Zaotar;
comp. Y. XXVIII, 11. Several broken sentences from other parts of the
Avesta are here doubtfully recalled, perhaps as having especial
sanctity.

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[246:7](sbe31033.htm#fr_1032) The Raspi brings
the Haoma-vessel to the Baresman at this point; and touching its stand,
the Mâh-rû, lays a cloth on the right hand of the Zaotar, who, looking
at the vessel, proceeds to recite as follows in verse 10.

<span id="fn_1027"></span>[247:1](sbe31033.htm#fr_1033) See Y. VIII,
5-8.

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[247:2](sbe31033.htm#fr_1034) See Y. III, 24,
25.

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[247:3](sbe31033.htm#fr_1035) This piece is in
the Gâthic dialect, and therefore an especially fitting prelude to the
Confession of faith in Y. XII.
