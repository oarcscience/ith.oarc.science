<p>This G&acirc;tha consists of the single chapter Y. LI. It has lines of fourteen syllables with caesura in the middle.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">YASNA LI.</h3>  <h4 align="center">INSTRUCTIONS AND APPEALS TO AN ASSEMBLY OF THE FAITHFUL.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">It is hardly possible that we have here a continuous whole. The thoughts, however, harmonise well enough, and the changes give little trouble. 1. As so often the Sovereign Authority of Ahura, His reign over the hearts and in the minds of His faithful worshippers, is the leading theme. That sovereign Power, when it is established, will produce every good thing with it, and repress every evil, and the composer prays that he may never pause at any moment in his efforts to bring that kingdom on. 2. Accordingly, as the foremost of objects, he beseeches for both its blessings and its protection, and names &Acirc;ramaiti as the especial representative of Ahura in this case to grant the Kingdom as a Realm established in spiritual wealth, and whose first effect should be the glory of God through the agency of holy dispositions in men.</p>  
<p>3. The spirit of the Da&ecirc;na is public and prophetic rather than occult and mysterious. The people therefore gather to hear G&acirc;thas recited, and religious harangues delivered as on political occasions, and all the more because the M&atilde;thras are declared to be the results of direct inspiration from Ahura. 4. The present recitations are invocations calling for the four energising Immortals, the guiding Order, the active Piety, the inspiring Benevolence, and the Power-wielding Kingdom, and, in using these names, the multitude are also beseeching, by the voice of their spokesman, for the Ratu, the Saoshya<I>n</I>t cried for by the Kine, looked for by Asha himself, and promised by Ahura.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">5. And the men who press this prayer are, each of them, for the moment (n&ucirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;<I>t</I>), as the Ratu himself. Wise in his homage, he seeks to gain the kine, like the ideal husbandman, both as property and as emblem, and he desires to establish the Ratu, understood as a person, or as the law, which may judge between the two sides (Y. XXXI, 2), and, by the expulsion of the evil, give quiet to the land (Y. XLVI, 4; Y. LIII, 9). 6. Declaring Ahura to be the awarder of the highest good and deepest evil, (7) he calls on Him to grant the 'eternal two,' the rewarding Immortals (not named in the former verse), but only by means of the inspired teachings. 8. And as these inculcations are effective for himself, he will declare forth their threats and promises to others, being repaid for his zealous fidelity in the very act. 9. Recalling the hopes of vengeance, he beseeches Ahura to give forth a sign, or instrument, from the holy Fire, which may settle the disputes by the forged blade of justice. 10. For he declares that the man who murderously assaults his adherents in the opposing interest (see Y. XXXII, 10, &amp;c.) is inherently and originally perverted in his motives, a very son of the Lie, and of the seed of Ak&ocirc;man.</p>  
<p>11. While in terms he addresses Ahura, he in reality challenges the devotion of the chieftains, as he calls aloud to the Deity.</p>  
<p>12. Here a temptation of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra is narrated, as in the Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d, here dwelling on his youth, there on his maturer manhood. But the verse shows marked signs of later age.</p>  
<p>13. And the soul of the righteous is encouraged by the recorded example; he shall come off the conqueror, as Zarathu<I>s</I>tra did.</p>  
<p>14. But the Karpans (priestly chiefs?) of the opposing party, following the typical destroyer (as in Y. XXXII), would bring the world to ruin, and the creatures to Hell.</p>  
<p>15. The true disciples will however infallibly receive the promised recompense.</p>  
<p>16. And as for that <I>K</I>isti, conceived by Mazda to give the saving knowledge in the sacred verse, the King of the Realm had acquired it. It will be stored in the memory of faithful priests under his care and rule; and he will give his subjects a good worship (Y. XLIX, 7) in accordance with it. 17. A female saint, also illustrious in rank, is celebrated with honourable mention; she is, as it were, the <I>K</I>isti in her person, as she is named in this connection.</p>  
<p>18. Another devoted friend arrests the speaker's eye, as he stands in the assembly; (59) and still another. 20. Then, as if taking in all with his view, and with an expression which shows</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">his identification with the people, he declares that the 'Archangels' are of one mind with Mazda in bestowing spiritual blessings, the chief of which are inspired words, the source of their discipline, and the guide of their hopes.</p>  
<p>21. And with assurances as to the greatness of the spiritual blessings implied in all that he has said, he prays Ahura all the more earnestly to grant them to His elect. 22. And he declares that Ahura knows and observes the man who fulfils every command that he has uttered, as well as believes every doctrine which he has divulged, and that, knowing Him, He also marks Him as the object of His grace. And he ends by expressing once more his desire to approach the Bountiful Immortals, not as naming them alone, but naming them, as we may well suppose, with a full appreciation of all that is meant by the sacred words which belong to them as names.</FONT></p>

<p>1. The good Government (of Ahura&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_785"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) is to be chosen (among all wished-for things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_788"></A><A HREF="#fn_786"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>) as that lot which most of all brings on (our happiness). Actions that oppress us it opposes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_789"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, through the holy Order (which pervades it), and with the pious zeal (of its true servants).

<p>2. And first I will ask for&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_790"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> these two blessings of Your own, O Thou Great Creator, and thou His Righteous Order! and I also ask of thee, Our Piety (personified, as well); and grant me this Your Sovereign Rule over our desired wealth (to give and to preserve it; and likewise) those spiritual blessings which are advantageous for our worship (of Ahura) through (the inspiration of His) Good Mind (within the soul).</p>  
<p>3. (And it is not I alone who thus appeal to You; I speak for all) who are guarded in the (ceremonial and moral) actions of Your (law), and by those (inspired) words (which proceed) from the tongue of Thy Good Mind (as he speaks within Thy M&atilde;thra). Yea, these are all assembling (each) to hear You, of whom Thou, O Ahura Mazda! art the foremost guide&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_791"></A><A HREF="#fn_789"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and light.</p>  
<p>4. (And they cry aloud to Thee, O Mazda! I speaking with them, and in their name): Where is the (promised&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_792"></A><A HREF="#fn_790"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>) lord of our thrift (the embodied law, saving us from the most dreaded dangers that we fear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_793"></A><A HREF="#fn_791"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, the thrift-lord) of (our) ready zeal?

<p>5. And it is the tiller of the earth who asks this of Thee, O Ahura! (Thy chosen saint himself); he has asked this all of Thee, striving to discover how he may gain to himself the sacred Kine (and with all wealth in herds beside. And he would seek this) moved by the motives which flow from Thy Righteous Order (and Thy cause), upright as he is in actions, and wise in his self-humbling worship (of that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_795"></A><A HREF="#fn_793"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> One) who, as a righteous ruler, has appointed a just controlling guide for those whom He has made.</p>

<p>a false god of the Da&ecirc;vas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_797"></A><A HREF="#fn_795"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>). And this will He bestow through His divine Authority (established in preparation here), while on the withholder of the sacrifice, who offers nothing to His (cause), He will send worse than the evil (and that not here alone, but) in the last turning of the creation in its course!</p>  
<p>7. (And as Thou wilt bestow thus graciously on him), so grant me also, O Thou most bountiful Spirit Mazda, Thou who hast made both the Kine and the waters and the plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_798"></A><A HREF="#fn_796"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (for her support) both Immortality and Welfare, those two eternal powers, and through Thy Good Mind in the doctrine (which is revealed through his inspired words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_799"></A><A HREF="#fn_797"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>).</p>  
<p>8. (Yea, grant me these two inseparable gifts, for having them in store) I will speak for Thee, O Mazda! because to the man of understanding&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_800"></A><A HREF="#fn_798"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> one should declare for Thee that which is woe to the wicked, but salvation to him who has maintained the holy Order (in Thy folk and in his soul). For he is (repaid in his deed, and) rejoiced by the M&atilde;thra who declares it to the wise.</p>  
<p>9. (And when I shall speak, I will declare for You that mental) keenness (which reaches the decision), and which Thou hast bestowed upon the two striving sides&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_801"></A><A HREF="#fn_799"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, (in Thy satisfying word). And this</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_792"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_794">180:1</A> It is hardly necessary to call attention to the fact that these abstracts are personified here, as in so many other places in the G&acirc;thas. We may indeed doubt whether the idea of personification was ever wholly absent, the original meaning being likewise never lost. Professor Wilhelm prefers taking Ashem as an accusative, 'how does one (do they) come to Asha?' This is admirable; but I am, on the whole, inclined to regard Ashem as a nominative with fseratu<I>s</I>, &Acirc;r(a)maiti<I>s</I>, &amp;c., taking the plurals yas&ocirc; <I>h</I><I>v</I>y<I>e</I>n (hy<I>e</I>n) as irregularly extending to the other subjects.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_793"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_795">180:2</A> So Wilhelm (by letter), taking a form of the pronoun as understood. It is difficult to suppose that the v&acirc;strya could be referred to as appointing the Ratu through the influence of his devotion and pious supplications; as Wilhelm justly says, the third line must apply to Ahura.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_794"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_796">180:3</A> See Y. XLIII, 3; notice ahm&acirc;i as referring to h&ocirc;i.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_795"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_797">181:1</A> See Y. XXXI, 17 where the faith of the dregva<I>n</I>t is sufficiently recognised to form the basis for a question, rhetorical indeed, but still a question.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_796"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_798">181:2</A> From this and similar occurrences of the 'water and the plants' beside 'Immortality and Welfare' probably arose the later peculiar identification of those names with water and plants.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_797"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_799">181:3</A> Compare perhaps verse 20.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_800"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_802">182:1</A> Compare Y. XXXII, 7, <I>h</I><I>v</I>a&ecirc;n&acirc; ayangh&acirc; (lit. iron).</p>  
<p>Others see the ordeal of fire here, and the bath of melted metal from which the righteous suffers nothing, but in which the sinner is consumed, but r&acirc;shayangh&ecirc; seems to point to injury produced otherwise than by dipping, and dakhshta certainly designates a metallic instrument elsewhere; 'sign' is, however, the original meaning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_801"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_803">182:2</A> So several times; comp. Y. XXVIII, 3, where the depth is unmistakable; see also Y. XXXI, 18 with ah&ucirc;b&icirc;<I>s</I> in the next verse.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_802"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_804">182:3</A> The Pahlavi while not strictly correct, affords the indication of a causative, s&ucirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;n&ecirc;<I>d</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_803"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_805">182:4</A> From this verse probably arose the later association of khshathra-vairya and metal founding and forging.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_804"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_806">182:5</A> As invoking Asha is in the antithesis, I regard ash&acirc;<I>t</I> as understood here.

<P><A NAME="fn_808"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_810">182:9</A> See the fourth verse.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_809"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_811">183:1</A> Some other portion of the human body, suggested by the context, may be meant by aodare<I>s</I>. The word looks like a verbal form, 3rd pl., but see the preceding dual.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_810"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_812">183:2</A> I render the Pahlavi of this most difficult verse as follows: Far from satisfying me is the K&icirc;k, the paederast, in regard to both of the two particulars [food and clothing] on the path of winter; (far from satisfying me) who am Zart&ucirc;sht, the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;man, with whom he is; that is, (or 'where') he incites me with his incitation in my bodily (?) (sensations; reading astak (?)); [that is, a person comes, and thus also they, or he, would do it to me]; and this one who (is doing) [that to us] is also leading us on, even in our progress in the cold [of a winter] of accustomed sin, (or in the cold iniquitous winter). This verse seems a very ancient interpolation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_811"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_813">183:3</A> Haith&icirc;m is an adverb; its position also does not so much favour an accusative substantive.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_812"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_814">183:4</A> So our texts; but the Pahlavi translator saw khraozhdait&icirc; (see Y. XLVI, 11) in his MSS., rendering khr&ucirc;si<I>s</I>n&#335; yehab&ucirc;nd = utter cries: 'while his soul cries fiercely.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_813"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_815">183:5</A> The occurrence of peret<I>a</I>u(&acirc;o) in this verse sheds light upon the peret&ocirc; in the previous one. &Acirc;k<I>a</I>u(&acirc;o) seems to be an attracted form for a loc. as elsewhere. Perhaps it is miswritten.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_814"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_816">184:1</A> N&atilde;sv<I>a</I>u(&acirc;o) would naturally mean 'reaching'; but the word is also elsewhere used in an evil sense, 'reaching to harm.' Y. LIII, 7. The Pahlavi, however, indicates the reading nasv<I>a</I>u by its nas&icirc;n&ecirc;nd. Does the Avesta show an original evil sense to nas = to reach? May the two nas possibly have some original connection? That <I>h</I><I>v</I>&acirc;i<I>s</I> <I>s</I>kyaothn&acirc;i<I>s</I> means here 'by means of' rather than 'because of' is the more probable from the same words in the next verse, and this notwithstanding Y. XXXI, 20.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_815"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_817">184:2</A> So general a term as 'creatures' should be avoided where possible; but see ye d&acirc;tha&ecirc;iby&ocirc; ere<I>s</I> rat&ucirc;m khshay&atilde;s ashav<I>a</I>u <I>k</I>ist&acirc; (verse 5).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_816"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_818">184:3</A> As to the grammatical structure, all depends on s<I>e</I><I>n</I>d&acirc;. Shall we bring down n&ocirc;i<I>t</I> from the verse above; or shall we regard s<I>e</I><I>n</I>d&acirc; as in an evil sense from sad as in sadr&acirc;? The Pahlavi favours the former, as also in Y. XXXVIII, 5 (Sp. 15). The general result is not, however, affected. Read as alternative: No friends to the creatures are the Karpans as to perfect (harvests) from the fields, (not) blessing us in the matter of perfect (care and fodder) for the cattle, &amp;c.; (sad in the sense of blessing with n&ocirc;i<I>t</I>).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_820"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_822">184:7</A> Alternatives would be, 'Ahura will meet these engagements (?) made when the reward was promised;' or, 'the reward which Zarathu<I>s</I>tra promised before Ahura came into Gar&ocirc;<I>d</I>man.' According <A NAME="page_185"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 185</FONT></A> to the general form of the G&acirc;thic sentence, <I>k</I>&ocirc;i<I>s</I>t par&acirc; go more naturally together than if the force of the par&acirc; was extended to <I>g</I>asa<I>t</I>.

<P><A NAME="fn_821"></A><A HREF="sbe31021.htm#fr_823">185:1</A> Maga may have some such cast of meaning.
