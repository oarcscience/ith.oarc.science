### YASNA LIX (SP. LVIII).

#### MUTUAL BLESSINGS.

1-17. (See Y. XVII, 1-17.) 18-27. (See Y. XXVI, 1-10.) 28. We worship
Verethraghna, the Ahura-made, the victorious blow; and we worship the
Saoshya*n*t, who smites with victory; and we sacrifice to this Baresman
with its Zaothra and its girdle (which is its band) and which is spread
with sanctity. And we sacrifice to (our) own soul(s), and to (our) own
Fravashi(s). 29. (See Y. XVII, 19.) 30. (The Ratu speaks): O thou good
(servant of the Lord)! may that be thine which is better than the good;
may’st thou acquire that which is (thine) own <span
id="fr_1299"></span>[1](#fn_1289) in the Zaothra; may’st thou attain to
that reward which the Zaotar has been obtaining <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[2](#fn_1290), who is far advanced in his good
thoughts, and words, and deeds.

31\. (The Zaotar speaks): May that happen to you (likewise) which is
better than the good, and may that not happen which is worse than the
evil, and may that likewise not be my lot. 32. As (our) Ahû (is)
excellent, so (is our) Ratu (one who rules) from his Righteousness, a
creator of mental goodness, and of life's actions done for Mazda, and
the Kingdom (is) to Ahura which to the poor will offer a nurturer. A
blessing is Asha called the Best, &c. We sacrifice to the Ahuna-vairya;
we sacrifice to Asha Vahi*s*ta <span id="fr_1301"></span>[3](#fn_1291)
the most beautiful, the Bountiful

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Immortal. And we
sacrifice to the Fshûshô-mãthra, the by-spoken <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[1](#fn_1292). And we sacrifice to the entire
collection of the Praises of the Yasna; (yea), to the Yasna Praises
which were instituted in the world of yore.

<span id="fn_1290"></span>[309:2](sbe31064.htm#fr_1300) Hanayamnô
*a*ungha, a periphrastic perfect.

<span id="fn_1291"></span>[309:3](sbe31064.htm#fr_1301) Asha Vahi*s*ta
occurs as immediately suggested by the Ashem <span id="page_310">p.
310</span> Vohû formula, Asha Vahi*s*ta seems therefore a proper name,
both here and in the formula, if one place explains the other (?).

<span id="fn_1292"></span>[310:1](sbe31064.htm#fr_1302) The ever-spoken
(?). The YêNhê and Ahuna follow.
