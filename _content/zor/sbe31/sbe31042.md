### YASNA XX.

#### ZAND, OR COMMENTARY, ON THE ASHEM VOHÛ.

1\. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the best; there is weal, there
is weal to this man when the Right (helps) the Righteousness best, (when
the pious man serves it in truth <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[5](#fn_1135)). Ahura Mazda spake forth: Ashem vohû
vahi*s*tem asti. To this Asha, the holy ritual sanctity, one attributes
the

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

qualities of 'good' and 'best,' as one attributes property to an owner;
thus this sentence vohû vahi*s*tem asti is substantiated (at once <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[1](#fn_1136)).

2\. U*s*tâ asti u*s*tâ ahmâi; by this attribution of blessedness (the
praiser) assigns every person (or thing) of a sacred nature to every
holy person, and as one usually (?) and regularly (?) <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[2](#fn_1137) assigns every person or thing
(?) <span id="fr_1147"></span>[3](#fn_1138) that is holy to every holy
man.

3\. Yya*t* ashâi vahi*s*tai <span id="fr_1148"></span>[4](#fn_1139); by
these words the worshipper ascribes the entire Mãthra (to Asha
Vahi*s*ta), and ascribes all to the Mãthra, as one ascribes the kingdom
to Righteousness, and as one ascribes righteousness to the invoking
saint; yea, as one ascribes righteousness to us who are the prophets
(who shall help and bless the people). The three maxims of the sentences
(are thus fulfilled). And every word (in its detail), and the entire
utterance in its proclamation, is the word of Ahura Mazda.

CATECHETICAL ADDITION <span id="fr_1149"></span>[5](#fn_1140).

4\. Mazda has made a proclamation. (Question.) Whom did He announce?
(Answer.) That holy one who is both heavenly and earthly. (Question.) Of
what character is He who has thus announced Him? (Answer.) He is the
best, and the one who is exercising sovereign power. (Question.) Of what
character is the man whom He announced? (Answer.)

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The holy and the
best, the one who rules with no capricious tyranny.

We sacrifice to the (several) part(s) of the Asha Vahi*s*ta (prayer). We
sacrifice to the heard-recital of the Asha Vahi*s*ta, to its memorising,
its chanting, and its sacrificial use <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1](#fn_1141)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[266:5](sbe31042.htm#fr_1144) Elsewhere
verbally different; 'when Asha is for A.V.'

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[267:1](sbe31042.htm#fr_1145) It is carried
into effect; possibly 'rendered fit for praising'(?).

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[267:2](sbe31042.htm#fr_1146) The Pahlavi
indicates nâ stâitya (?).

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[267:3](sbe31042.htm#fr_1147) Ashavanem here
and in Y. XIX, 19 might be a neuter from a transition, or addition.

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[267:4](sbe31042.htm#fr_1148) 'Ashem.'

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[267:5](sbe31042.htm#fr_1149) This
Catechetical addition is identical with that in Y. XIX. The wording
alone is slightly altered in the translation to relieve the sameness.

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[268:1](sbe31042.htm#fr_1150) The YêNhê hâtãm
follows.
