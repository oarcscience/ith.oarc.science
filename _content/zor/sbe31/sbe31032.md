### YASNA X.

11\. Let the Demon-gods and Goddesses fly far away <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[1](#fn_994) from hence, and let the good Sraosha
make here his home! \[And may the good Blessedness here likewise
dwell\], and may she here spread delight and peace within this house,
Ahura's, which is sanctified by H(a)oma, bringing righteousness (to
all).

2\. At the first force of thy pressure, O intelligent!

I praise thee with my voice, while I grasp at first thy shoots. At thy
next pressure, O intelligent! I praise thee with my voice, when as with
full force of a man I crush thee down.

3\. I praise the cloud that waters thee, and the rains which make thee
grow on the summits of the mountains; and I praise thy lofty mountains
where the H(a)oma branches spread <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[2](#fn_995).

4\. This wide earth do I praise, expanded far (with paths), the
productive, the full bearing, thy mother, holy plant! Yea, I praise the
lands where thou dost grow, sweet-scented, swiftly spreading, the good
growth of the Lord. O H(a)oma, thou growest on the mountains, apart on
many paths <span id="fr_1002"></span>[3](#fn_996), and there still
may’st thou flourish. The springs of Righteousness most verily thou art,
(and the fountains of the ritual find their source in thee)!

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

5\. Grow (then) because I pray to thee on all thy stems and branches, in
all thy shoots (and tendrils) increase thou through my word!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6\. H(a)oma grows while he is praised, and the man who praises him is
therewith more victorious. The lightest pressure of thee, H(a)oma, thy
feeblest praise, the slightest tasting of thy juice, avails to the
thousand-smiting of the D(a)êvas.

7\. Wasting doth vanish from that house, and with it foulness, whither
in verity they bear thee, and where thy praise in truth is sung, the
drink of H(a)oma, famed, health-bringing (as thou art). \[(Pâzand) to
his village and abode they bear him.\]

8\. All other toxicants go hand in hand with Rapine of the bloody spear,
but H(a)oma's stirring power goes hand in hand with friendship. \[Light
is the drunkenness of H(a)oma (Pâzand).\]

Who as a tender son caresses H(a)oma, forth to the bodies of such
persons H(a)oma comes to heal.

9\. Of all the healing virtues, H(a)oma, whereby thou art a healer,
grant me some. Of all the victorious powers, whereby thou art a victor,
grant me some. A faithful praiser will I be to thee, O H(a)oma, and a
faithful praiser (is) a better (thing) than Righteousness the Best; so
hath the Lord, declaring (it), decreed.

10\. Swift <span id="fr_1003"></span>[1](#fn_997) and wise hath the
well-skilled <span id="fr_1004"></span>[2](#fn_998) Deity created thee;
swift and wise on high Haraiti did He, the well-skilled, plant thee.

11\. And taught (by implanted instinct) on every

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

side, the bounteous <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1](#fn_999) birds have
carried thee to the Peaks-above-the-eagles <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[2](#fn_1000), to the mount's extremest summit, to
the gorges and abysses, to the heights of many pathways <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[3](#fn_1001), to the snow-peaks ever whitened.

12\. There, H(a)oma, on the ranges dost thou grow of many kinds. Now
thou growest of milky whiteness, and now thou growest golden; and forth
thine healing liquors flow for the inspiring of the pious. So terrify
away from me the (death's) aim of the curser. So terrify and crush his
thought who stands as my maligner.

13\. Praise be to thee, O H(a)oma, (for he makes the poor man's thoughts
as great as any of the richest whomsoever.) Praise be to H(a)oma, (for
he makes the poor man's thoughts as great as when mind reacheth
culmination.) With manifold retainers dost thou, O H(a)oma, endow the
man who drinks thee mixed with milk; yea, more prosperous thou makest
him, and more endowed with mind.

14\. Do not vanish from me suddenly like milk-drops in the rain; let
thine exhilarations go forth ever vigorous and fresh; and let them come
to me with strong effect. Before thee, holy H(a)oma, thou bearer of the
ritual truth, and around thee would I cast this body, a body which (as
all) may see (is fit for gift and) grown <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[4](#fn_1002).

15\. I renounce with vehemence the murderous woman's <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[5](#fn_1003) emptiness, the *G*aini's, hers, with
intellect

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

dethroned <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1](#fn_1004). She vainly thinks to
foil us, and would beguile both Fire-priest and H(a)oma; but she
herself, deceived therein, shall perish. And when she sits at home <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[2](#fn_1005), and wrongly eats of H(a)oma's
offering, priest's mother will that never make her, nor give her
holy <span id="fr_1012"></span>[3](#fn_1006) sons!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

16\.  <span id="fr_1013"></span>[4](#fn_1007)To five do I belong, to
five others do I not; of the good thought am I, of the evil am I not; of
the good word am I, of the evil am I not; of the good deed am I, and of
the evil, not.

To Obedience am I given, and to deaf disobedience, not; to the saint do
I belong, and to the wicked, not; and so from this on till the ending
shall be the spirits’ parting. (The two shall here divide.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

17\. Thereupon spake Zarathu*s*tra: Praise to H(a)oma, Mazda-made. Good
is H(a)oma, Mazda-made. All the plants of H(a)oma praise I, on the
heights of lofty mountains, in the gorges of the valleys, in the clefts
(of sundered hill-sides) cut for the bundles bound by women. From the
silver cup I pour Thee to the golden chalice over <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[5](#fn_1008). Let me not thy (sacred) liquor spill
to earth, of precious cost.

18\. These are thy Gâthas <span id="fr_1015"></span>[6](#fn_1009), holy
H(a)oma, these

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

thy songs, and these thy teachings <span
id="fr_1016"></span>[1](#fn_1010), and these thy truthful ritual words,
health <span id="fr_1017"></span>[2](#fn_1011)-imparting,
victory-giving, from harmful hatred healing giving.

19\. These and thou art mine, and forth let thine exhilarations flow;
bright and sparkling let them hold on their (steadfast) way; for light
are thine exhilaration(s), and flying lightly come they here.
Victory-giving smiteth H(a)oma, victory-giving is it worshipped; with
this Gâthic word we praise it.

20\. Praise to the Kine; praise and victory (be) spoken to her! Food for
the Kine, and pasture! 'For the Kine let thrift use toil; yield thou us
food <span id="fr_1018"></span>[3](#fn_1012).'

21\. We worship the yellow lofty one; we worship H(a)oma who causes
progress, who makes the settlements advance; we worship H(a)oma who
drives death afar; yea, we worship all the H(a)oma plants. And we
worship (their) blessedness, and the Fravashi of Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma,
the saint <span id="fr_1019"></span>[4](#fn_1013).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_994"></span>[240:1](sbe31032.htm#fr_1000) The Pahlavi as
corrected by the MS. of Dastur Hoshang*g*i *G*âmâsp*g*i has barâ akhar
min latamman pa*d*ênd barâ shêdâ-; Ner. *Ri*te pa*sk*ât asmât
prapatanti, *ri*te devâ*h* *ri*te devasahâyâ*h* devyâ*h*, uttama*h*
*S*ro*s*o nivasati.

<span id="fn_995"></span>[240:2](sbe31032.htm#fr_1001) Or, 'where, O
Haoma! thou hast grown,' reading—i*s*a with Barth. as 2nd sing. perf.
pret. middle.

<span id="fn_996"></span>[240:3](sbe31032.htm#fr_1002) Or, 'on the
pathways of the birds.'

<span id="fn_997"></span>[241:1](sbe31032.htm#fr_1003) Having immediate
effect, and giving wisdom.

<span id="fn_998"></span>[241:2](sbe31032.htm#fr_1004) Comp. Y. XLIV, 5.

<span id="fn_999"></span>[242:1](sbe31032.htm#fr_1005) Possibly 'the
birds taught by the bounteous one;' the 'God-taught birds.'

<span id="fn_1000"></span>[242:2](sbe31032.htm#fr_1006) Elsewhere and
here also possibly a proper name.

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[242:3](sbe31032.htm#fr_1007) Or the 'pathways
of the birds;' so Haug, following Spiegel and Justi. Gu*g*rati, as
above.

<span id="fn_1002"></span>[242:4](sbe31032.htm#fr_1008) Which is seen as
mine well-grown.

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[242:5](sbe31032.htm#fr_1009) *G*aini seems
always used in an evil sense in the later Avesta.

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[243:1](sbe31032.htm#fr_1010) I would correct
to a form of khratu.

<span id="fn_1005"></span>[243:2](sbe31032.htm#fr_1011) Compare the
avoiding the service mentioned by the Pahlavi translator on Y. LIII, 5.

<span id="fn_1006"></span>[243:3](sbe31032.htm#fr_1012) Or, more safely,
'many sons.'

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[243:4](sbe31032.htm#fr_1013) Haoma speaks.

<span id="fn_1008"></span>[243:5](sbe31032.htm#fr_1014) Here the priest
evidently manipulates the cups containing the Haoma-juice.

<span id="fn_1009"></span>[243:6](sbe31032.htm#fr_1015) The application
of this term here seems to point to a high antiquity for the Haoma
Ya*s*t; if not in the present piece, which is not so old as the Gâthas,
then in previous hymns to Haoma of which this Ya*s*t is an improvement,
or extension.

<span id="fn_1010"></span>[244:1](sbe31032.htm#fr_1016) Ner. possibly
figuratively yâ*h* ka*sk*it asvâdanâ*h*.

<span id="fn_1011"></span>[244:2](sbe31032.htm#fr_1017) Ner.
saundarya*m*.

<span id="fn_1012"></span>[244:3](sbe31032.htm#fr_1018) See Y. XLVIII,
5.

<span id="fn_1013"></span>[244:4](sbe31032.htm#fr_1019) The YêNhê hâtãm
follows.
