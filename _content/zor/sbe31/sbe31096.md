### VISPARAD XIX (SP. XXII) <span id="fr_1503"></span>[1](#fn_1486).

1\. We worship Ahura Mazda the bountiful; and we worship the Bountiful
Immortals (saying the Spe*n*ta). And we sacrifice to the bountiful
saint, and to the bountiful anticipative understanding <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[2](#fn_1487). Also we sacrifice to the good and
bountiful Âramaiti (the ready mind). And we worship her together
with <span id="fr_1505"></span>[3](#fn_1488) the bountiful creatures in
the creation of the pure. And we sacrifice to the holy creatures who
have intelligence as their first <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[4](#fn_1489), (to those foremost in their mind).
And we worship the omniscient understanding, and Him who is Ahura Mazda
(Himself). 2. And we sacrifice to the shining sun, which is the highest
of the high; yea, we worship the sun together with the Bountiful
Immortals, and the Mãthras with their good ceremonies <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[5](#fn_1490). Also we sacrifice to the glorious
achievements, and to this glory (which we have gained). And we sacrifice
to the herds which have the Fire and its blessings <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[6](#fn_1491). Also we worship the holy benefit
which is so widely

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

diffused <span id="fr_1509"></span>[1](#fn_1492), and that wisdom which
is the bounteous Âramaiti, whose are the laws <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[2](#fn_1493) of the Righteous Order, and of those
holy creatures who have Righteousness as their first.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1486"></span>[360:1](sbe31096.htm#fr_1503) The word
spe*n*ta throughout alludes to the Gâtha Spe*n*tâ-mainyu, but it is of
course not without grammatical application.

<span id="fn_1487"></span>[360:2](sbe31096.htm#fr_1504) In the
Bundahi*s* especially referred to Ahura.

<span id="fn_1488"></span>[360:3](sbe31096.htm#fr_1505) Or, 'together
with the bountiful creatures we worship the holy creatures.'

<span id="fn_1489"></span>[360:4](sbe31096.htm#fr_1506) This expression
may have been accidentally determined by the position of the word manô
in the Ahuna-vairya formula; see Y: XIX, 12.

<span id="fn_1490"></span>[360:5](sbe31096.htm#fr_1507) Or, 'the
well-fulfilled.'

<span id="fn_1491"></span>[360:6](sbe31096.htm#fr_1508) 'Fire-made' is
unintelligible; 'fire gifts-having' may refer to the flocks and herds,
as expressing the source of that prosperity which is represented by the
holy Fire.

<span id="fn_1492"></span>[361:1](sbe31096.htm#fr_1509) Pahl. fravaft
sû*d*.

<span id="fn_1493"></span>[361:2](sbe31096.htm#fr_1510) Dâthra with K4.
