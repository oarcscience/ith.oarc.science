### YASNA LV (SP. LIV).

#### THE WORSHIP OF THE GÂTHAS AS CONCLUDED, AND THAT OF THE STAOTA YÊSNYA <span id="fr_1237"></span>[1](#fn_1227) AS BEGINNING.

1\. We present hereby and we make known, as our offering to the
bountiful Gâthas which rule (as the leading chants) within (the
appointed times and seasons of) the Ritual, all our landed riches, and
our persons, together with our very bones and tissues, our forms and
forces, our consciousness, our soul, and Fravashi.

2\. That which Gâthas (may) be to us, which are our guardians and
defenders, and our spiritual food, yea, which (may) be to our souls both
food and clothing, such are these Gâthas to us, guardians, and
defenders, and (spiritual) food, even such they are, both food and
clothing to the soul.

And (may) they be to us (for this our offering) abundant givers of
rewards, and just and righteous ones, for the world beyond the present,
after the parting of our consciousness and body. 3. And may these
(Praises of the Offering) come forth, and appear for us with power and
victorious assault, with health and healing, with progress, and with
growth, with preparation and protection, with beneficence and sanctity,
and abounding with gifts <span id="fr_1238"></span>[2](#fn_1228) toward
him who can understand; yea, let them appear (with free liberality to
the enlightened), let them appear as

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mazda, the most
beneficent, has produced them, He the one who is victorious when He
smites, and who helps the settlements advance, for the protection, and
the guarding of the religious order of the settlements which are now
being furthered, and of those which shall bring salvation to us, and for
the protection of the entire creation of the holy (and the clean).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4\. And may’st thou, (O Asha! who abidest within the Gâthas <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[1](#fn_1229)), give to every holy man who comes
with this prayer for a blessing, and endeavouring to help himself <span
id="fr_1240"></span>[2](#fn_1230), according to his good thoughts, and
words, and deeds.

5\. We are therefore worshipping both the (divine) Righteousness and the
Good Mind, and the bountiful Gâthas, that rule as the leading chants
within (the times and the seasons of) the holy ritual order.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6\. And we worship the Praises of the Yasna which were the production of
the ancient world, those which are (now) recollected and put in
use <span id="fr_1241"></span>[3](#fn_1231), those which are now learned
and taught, those which are being held (in mind, and so) repeated, those
remembered and recited, and those worshipped, and thus the ones which
further the world through grace in its advance.

And we worship the part(s) <span id="fr_1242"></span>[4](#fn_1232) of
the Praises of the Yasna, and their recitation as it is heard, even
their memorised recital, and their chanting, and their offering (as
complete).
