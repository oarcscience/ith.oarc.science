### YASNA LXI (SP. LX).

1\. Let us peal <span id="fr_1319"></span>[4](#fn_1308) forth the
Ahuna-vairya in our liturgy between the heaven and earth, and let us
send forth the Asha Vahi*s*ta in our prayer the same, and the YêNhê
hâtãm. And let us send forth in our liturgies between the heaven and
earth the pious and good prayer of the pious man for blessings, (2) for
the encounter with, and for the displacement of Angra Mainyu with his
creatures which are likewise evil as he is, for he is filled with death
(for those whom he has made). Aye, let us send that petition forth for
the encounter with, and for the dislodgment of the Ka*hv*aredha <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[5](#fn_1309) and of the individual Ka*hv*aredhas
the male, and the female

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (to the last
individual of each), (3) and for the encounter with, and the dislodgment
of the Kayadhas, and of the individual Kayadhians, male and female <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[1](#fn_1310), and of the thieves and robbers, of
the Zandas <span id="fr_1322"></span>[2](#fn_1311), and the sorcerers,
of the covenant breakers, and of those who tamper with the covenants. 4.
Yea, we send it forth for the encounter with, and for the overthrow of
the murderers of the saints, and of those who hate and torment us for
our Faith, and of those who persecute the ritual, and the tyrant full of
death. Yea, let us peal them forth for the encounter with, and the
overthrow of the wicked, O Zarathu*s*tra Spitama! whoever they may be,
whose thoughts, and words, and works are not congenial to the holy
ritual laws.

5\. And how shall we drive the Demon of the Lie from hence from us <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[3](#fn_1312)? Aye, how shall we, the prophets who
are yet to serve and save (thy people), drive the Dru*g* from hence, so
that we, having power over her as being utterly without power, may drive
her hence with blow from the seven Karshvars, for the encounter with,
and for the dislodgment of the entire evil world <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[4](#fn_1313)?
