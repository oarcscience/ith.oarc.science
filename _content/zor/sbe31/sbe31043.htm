These are the three sentences which comprehend all the Yasnian speech. (Question.) To whom is this Yasna addressed? (Answer.) To the Bountiful Immortals (in the course of the Yasna). 3. Thereupon spake Mazda: Salvation to this one, whosoever he may be! May the absolute ruler Ahura grant it. (Question.) 4. Whom did He answer with this answer? (Answer.) He answered: The state of salvation; and with this answer, 'the state of salvation,' he answered every saint who exists, every one who is coming into existence, and every one who shall exist in the future. (Question. Who answered thus? Answer.) The best One. (Question. What did He answer?) (Answer.) The best thing. (That is,) the best One, Mazda, answered the best and the holy (answer) for the better and the holy man. 5.

<P><A NAME="fn_1142"></A><A HREF="sbe31043.htm#fr_1151">268:2</A> The expressions in this prayer were suggested by Y. LI, 22; but the Zand does not consistently follow the thoughts in the G&acirc;tha. T<I>e</I>m understood should be supplied as an object for yazamaid&ecirc; in connection with y&ecirc;<FONT SIZE="-1">N</FONT>h&ecirc;, as well as t<I>a</I>us<I>k</I>&acirc; for y<I>a</I>ungh&atilde;m. In Y. LI, 22, it is, however, by no means certain that yaz&acirc;i applies to a t<I>e</I>m y&ecirc;hy&acirc;. Holding the twenty-first verse in mind, I am obliged to refer y&ecirc;hy&acirc; to n&acirc; spe<I>n</I>t&ocirc;. Here, however, men and women are worshipped, as it is improbable that the 'Immortals' whose names are in the feminine are meant. The prayer is in the G&acirc;thic dialect, and ancient metre would hardly contain so artificial a formation. It can only be defended from the t<I>e</I><I>n</I>g yaz&acirc;i <I>h</I><I>v</I>&acirc;i<I>s</I> n&acirc;m<I>e</I>n&icirc;<I>s</I> of Y. LI, 22.</p>  
<p>Or did the composer of the prayer correctly render Y. LI, 22, and boldly write his succinct words as being clear to his hearers from explanations which are now lost? Such explanations (oral or written) as a matter of course existed from the first. No composer fails to discuss his productions.</P>
