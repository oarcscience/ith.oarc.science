<p>1. I offer my sacrifice and homage to thee, the Fire, as a good offering, and an offering with our hail</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_314"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 314</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of salvation, even as an offering of praise with benedictions, to thee, the Fire, O Ahura Mazda's son! Meet for sacrifice art thou, and worthy of (our) homage. And as meet for sacrifice, and thus worthy of our homage, may&#8217;st thou be in the houses of men (who worship Mazda). Salvation be to this man who worships thee in verity and truth, with wood in hand, and Baresman ready, with flesh in hand, and holding too the mortar. 2. And may&#8217;st thou be (ever) fed with wood as the prescription orders. Yea, may&#8217;st thou have thy perfume justly, and thy sacred butter without fail, and thine andirons regularly placed. Be of full-age as to thy nourishment, of the canon's age as to the measure of thy food, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's son! 3. Be now aflame&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1325"></A><A HREF="#fn_1314"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> within this house; be ever without fail in flame; be all ashine within this house; be on thy growth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1326"></A><A HREF="#fn_1315"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> within this house; for long time be thou thus to the furtherance of the heroic (renovation), to the completion of (all) progress, yea, even till the good heroic (millennial) time when that renovation shall have become complete. 4. Give me, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's son! a speedy glory, speedy nourishment, and speedy booty, and abundant glory, abundant nourishment, abundant booty, an expanded mind, and nimbleness of tongue for soul and understanding, even an understanding continually growing in its largeness, and that never wanders&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1327"></A><A HREF="#fn_1316"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and long enduring virile power, (5) an offspring sure of foot, that never sleeps on watch [not for a third part of the day, or night], and that rises quick from bed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1328"></A><A HREF="#fn_1317"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and</p>

<p>likewise a wakeful offspring, helpful to nurture, or reclaim, legitimate, keeping order in men's meetings, (yea,) drawing men to assemblies through their influence and word, grown to power, skilful, redeeming others from oppression, served by many followers, which may advance my line (in prosperity and fame), and (my) V&icirc;s, and my Za<I>n</I>tu, and (my) province, (yea, an offspring) which may deliver orders to the Province as (firm and righteous rulers). 6. And may&#8217;st thou grant me, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's Son! that whereby instructors may be (given) me, now and for evermore, (giving light to me of Heaven) the best life of the saints, brilliant, all glorious. And may I have experience&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1329"></A><A HREF="#fn_1318"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the good reward, and the good renown, and of the long forecasting preparation of the soul. 7. The Fire of Ahura Mazda addresses this admonition to all for whom he cooks the night and morning (meal). From all these, O Spitama! he wishes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1330"></A><A HREF="#fn_1319"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to secure good care, and healthful care (as guarding for salvation), the care of a true praiser. 8. At both the hands of all who come by me, I, the Fire, keenly look: What brings the mate to his mate (thus I say to him), the one who walks at large, to him who sits at home? [We worship the bounteous Fire, the swift-driving charioteer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1331"></A><A HREF="#fn_1320"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.]</p>  
<p>9. And if this man who passes brings him wood brought (with good measure that is) with sacred care, or if he brings the Baresman spread with sanctity, or</p>

<p>the Hadh&acirc;na&ecirc;pata plant, then afterwards Ahura Mazda's Fire will bless him, contented, not offended, and in (its) satisfaction (saying thus). 10. May a herd of kine be with thee, and a multitude of men, may an active mind go with thee, and an active soul as well. As a blest soul may&#8217;st thou live through thy life, the nights which thou shall live. This is the blessing of the Fire for him who brings it wood (well) dried, sought out for flaming, purified with the earnest blessing of the sacred ritual truth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1332"></A><A HREF="#fn_1321"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 11. We strive after the flowing on of the good waters, and their ebb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1333"></A><A HREF="#fn_1322"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> as well, and the sounding of their waves, desiring their propitiation; I desire to approach them with my praise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1334"></A><A HREF="#fn_1323"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 12 = Y. III, 24, 25.</p>
