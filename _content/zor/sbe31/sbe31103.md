### III. ÂFRÎN\[-AGÂN\] <span id="fr_1550"></span>[2](#fn_1524) RAPITHVIN <span id="fr_1551"></span>[2](#fn_1524).

1\. I confess myself a Mazda-worshipper, of Zarathu*s*tra's order, a foe
to the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for Rapithwina, the holy
lord of the ritual order, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and
praise, and for Frâda*t*-fshu <span id="fr_1552"></span>[3](#fn_1525)
and Za*n*tuma <span id="fr_1553"></span>[4](#fn_1526),

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

the holy lord(s) of the ritual order. 2. And to Ahura Mazda, the
resplendent, the glorious, and to the Bountiful Immortals, be
propitiation, and to Asha Vahi*s*ta (who is Righteousness the Best), and
to the Fire, Ahura Mazda's son, and to all the holy Yazads, heavenly and
earthly, and to the Fravashis of the saints, the mighty and
overwhelming—.

3\. For thus did Ahura Mazda speak to Spitama Zarathu*s*tra the word
which was spoken for the ritual time of the Rapithwina, (saying): Ask
us, O holy Zarathu*s*tra <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1](#fn_1527), what
are Thy questions to be asked of us <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[2](#fn_1528), for Thy question is as that mighty
one when Thy ruler speaks his mighty wish <span
id="fr_1556"></span>[1](#fn_1527). 4. Then Zarathustra asked Ahura
Mazda: O Ahura Mazda, most bountiful <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[3](#fn_1529) creator of the material worlds and
holy! what does that man acquire, what does he merit, what reward shall
there be for that man (5) who shall recite the Rapithwina office with
the Rapithwina prayer for blessing, and who shall sacrifice with <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[4](#fn_1530) the Rapithwina office with hands
(well) washed, and with (well) washed mortars, with the Baresman spread,
and with Haoma high uplifted, and with fire brightly flaming, with
Ahuna-vairya loud intoned, with Haoma-moistened tongue, and with a body
Mãthra-bound? 6. And Ahura Mazda answered him: As the wind from the
southern quarter, O Spitama! causes the entire material world to advance
and to increase, and as it will bless it <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[5](#fn_1531), rejoice it, and cause it to
progress <span id="fr_1560"></span>[6](#fn_1532), such a like reward
does such a man receive, (7) who

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

recites the Rapithwina-ratu with the Rapithwina blessing, and sacrifices
with <span id="fr_1561"></span>[1](#fn_1533) it with (well) washed
hands, and mortars, with Baresman spread, and Haoma lifted, with fire
brightly flaming, and with Ahuna-vairya loud intoned, and with
Haoma-moistened tongue, and a body Mãthra-bound! 8. Thus hath Ahura
Mazda declared to Spitama Zarathu*s*tra the word which (should be)
spoken at the Rapithwina time. 9, 10. (See Â. I, 14-19.)
