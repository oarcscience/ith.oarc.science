### VISPARAD XVI (SP. XIX) <span id="fr_1494"></span>[2](#fn_1477).

1\. And we worship the Fire here, Ahura Mazda's son, and the Yazads
having the seed of fire in them, and the Rashnus having the seed of
fire <span id="fr_1495"></span>[3](#fn_1478) in them; and we worship the
Fravashis of the saints. And we worship Sraosha who smites with victory,
and the holy man, and the entire creation of the holy (and the clean).
2. And we worship the Blessedness and the Fravashi of Zarathu*s*tra
Spitâma, the saint. And we worship the saints and their blessed
Fravashis (as of one). And we worship all their Fravashis (as considered
each apart), and those of the saints within the Province, and those of
the saints without the Province; yea, we worship the Fravashis of holy
men and holy women (wherever they may be, those devoted to the Order of
the Faith). And we sacrifice to those whose (service)

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

for us in the Yasna Ahura Mazda, the holy, has known as the better <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[1](#fn_1479), and of these Zarathu*s*tra is the
living chief <span id="fr_1497"></span>[2](#fn_1480) and master. And we
sacrifice to the fields and the waters, the lands and the plants, and to
the constituent parts of the Yasna Haptanghâiti, its chapters, its
metred lines, its words, and word-structure.

tokhmak.
