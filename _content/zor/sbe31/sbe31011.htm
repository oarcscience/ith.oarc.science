<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Brighter times seem to have arrived. The vengeance so confidently promised in the close of XXXII is described as near at hand. In fact the first three verses seem to belong as much to XXXII as to the present chapter. They remind one of the choruses of attending saints, or 'Immortals,' in XXIX, perfectly germane to the connection, but referring in the third person to a speaker who closes the last chapter with a first, and who begins again with a first in verse 4. The propriety of a division of chapters here rests upon the fact that the thought comes to a climax at XXXII, 16, beginning afresh at XXXIII, 4. Whether Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, or the chief composer, whatever his name may have been, composed these three verses relating, as they do, to himself, and put them into the mouth of another, or whether their grammatical form indicates another author, is difficult to determine. I doubt very greatly whether either the expressions 'I approach,' 'I offer,' &amp;c., or the words 'he will act,' 'let him be in Asha's pastures,' are at all meant to express more than some modern hymns which use 'I' and 'he.<font size="-1" color="green">'</font> Both are in constant employment in anthology with no change in the person indicated. 'I' and Thy servant' are merely verbal variations. Here, however, the change is somewhat marked by the allusion to the chastisement of the wicked just previously mentioned in XXXII, 16<font size="-1" color="green">.</font> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. It is to be noticed that the strictest canon with the original, as indeed with the later, Zarathu<I>s</I>trians of the Avesta was the 'primeval law.' Unquestionably the precepts understood as following from the dualistic principle were intended; that is to say, no trifling with any form of evil, least of all with a foreign creed, was to be tolerated. Ahura has no share in the evolution of anything corrupt. We may even add that He had no power to prevent either sin or sorrow, although He possessed all conceivable power to oppose them. According to these fundamental laws, then, the Ratu is said to act, as sternly severe upon the evil as he is beneficent to the saint. 2. The fierce hostilities hitherto pursued are more than justified. The injury of the wicked by denouncing, planning, or by physical violence, is on a par with advising the good. They who pursue the enemies of Ahura are actually operating in love to God, and sacrificing to religion itself.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_69"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 69</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">3. And accordingly the reciter is made to pray in this immediate connection for a sincere and useful friend (a vahi<I>s</I>ta) to the believer, to whichever class he may belong, whether chief, allied peer, or villager, a friend spiritually enlightened (v&icirc;d&atilde;s), and, according to Ahura's prescript (XXIX, 2), keen, persevering, and brave in the cultivation of cattle (thwakhshangh&acirc; gav&ocirc;i). 'Let such an one as this, so asked for by the Lord himself, so needed by the Kine, let him,' he prays, 'be supported in his holy toil for us. Let him till and tend, not in the pastures of our valleys only, but in the spiritual pastures of the Divine Benevolence where the mystic kine is grazing.' 4. Taking up the peculiar 'I who' of XXVIII, the composer returns to the first person, continuing in that form with little exception until the last verse, which, naming Zarathu<I>s</I>tra in the third person, implies (if it is not an addition, which, however, it may be) that Zarathu<I>s</I>tra had been the speaker throughout. As it is highly probable that the author who uses this <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>I who' is the same who uses it in XXVIII, and if we may take verse 14 as fair evidence that Zarathustra is the speaker here, we acquire some additional grounds for believing that the person who wrote (if we can apply such an expression to the author) the words 'to Zarathu<I>s</I>tra and to us,' as well as 'to V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa and to me,' and 'to Frashao<I>s</I>tra and to me,' was universally recognised to be Zarathu<I>s</I>tra himself composing a piece to be recited by another. As if in response to the expression in verse 3, recalling that although a vahi<I>s</I>ta (a best one) to some of each class (verse 1) he was no contenter of the wicked (XLIII, 15), he begins a prayer which is only completed by its izy&acirc; in verse 6, and which gathers force by each preceding profession of fidelity. And true to a practical dualism, he first abjures the leading sin of disobedience to God, and of arrogance, discontent, and dishonesty toward man, accompanied (as it seems to have been) with neglect of the all-important duties to the cattle who shared the sanctity of 'the soul' of their representative. And perhaps it is this practical severity of dualism as opposed to the more facile 'lying' of the opposed religion, which was the cause of that high reputation of the Persians for veracity, which was grouped with avoiding debt by Herodotus among the virtues of the race. 5. I, he goes on to say, or to imply, I who not only abjure disobedience, insolence, complaint, and lying, but especially invoke the great genius who is Obedience himself, Obedience toward God, (Thee), endeavouring as I do by this abjuration and prayer to attain, not to a 'hundred autumns' of booty and glory, but to a long life in the kingdom which was established in the spirit of</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_70"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 70</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">the Divine Benevolence, and to paths not only for the war-cart, or for commerce, but to those rigidly straight paths of moral purity in which Ahura dwells, 6. I, he adds once more, who am thus Thine actually invoking (zbay&acirc;) invoker, 'straight' like the paths (erezu<I>s</I>), I am seeking with longing (kay&acirc;) to know from that Best Spirit (Thy Spe<I>n</I>ta Mainyu?) animated once more by that best mind, to know-what? Shall we regard it as a bathos when we read that he thus with cumulative urgency prays to know what the Best Spirit thought should be done for the recovery and perfection of the fields? If we turn back to XXIX, 1, we shall see that the identical word (v&acirc;stry&acirc;) describes the original want of the kine's soul. It was vohu v&acirc;stry&acirc; which she implored as her salvation; and it was the sacred agriculturist who alone could afford it, and who as the 'diligent tiller of the earth' always remained the typical saint. And as his useful deeds in reclaiming, irrigating, and cultivating land, were justly ranked among the first services of a human being, and as the last preparation of the gathered grain was perhaps humorously, but yet pungently, said to make the Da&ecirc;vas start, and shriek, and fly (see Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d III, 32, Sp. 165), and as further, a life from the fruits of the earth to this day constitutes the main difference between those who live by murderous theft and those who live honestly in nearly the same regions, I think we may not only see no bathos here, but on the contrary admire the robust sense of this early religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and say that a knowledge as to a true policy in the department of agriculture was one of the wisest possible desires, and the most of all things worthy of a 'sight of Mazda and of consultation with Him.' How the fields had better be worked, and how the people could best be kept from bloody freebooting as aggressors or as victims, this involved Ahura's Righteous Order, Benevolence, Power, and Piety, the four energising Immortals all at once. And this only could secure the other two rewarding personifications, Welfare and Immortality.</p>  
<p>7. Having prayed for that which is the first virtue of civilised existence, work (verezy&ecirc;idy&acirc;i), he proceeds to further petitions. 'Come Ye,' he beseeches in Vedic fashion. Come Ye, O Ahura, Asha, and Vohu Manah l and behold the attentive monarch, the leading Magavan, as he listens to my instructions with the other</FONT></p>  
<p>

<p><FONT SIZE="-1">chiefs, and the thronging masses. And let too the sacrificial gifts pour in for offering and worship.</p>  
<p>8. He rests at no bare morality for the simple multitude. He knows too well the human foible, therefore he asks with vigour for sacrifice and hymn.</p>  
<p>9. Encouraging the two pious chiefs whose souls go hand in hand, he prays that an influence like that of the 'eternal two' might bear their 'spirit' (sic) to the shining home of Paradise, it having attained to perfection by the help of the Best Mind of God within it. (For mainyu in this sense compare XLIV, 11.)</p>  
<p>10. Asking of Mazda to grant in His love (or 'by His will') all the happy phases of life which have been, or which shall ever be experienced, he prays that their bodies, that is, their persons, as separate accountable individuals (compare nar<I>e</I>m narem <I>h</I><I>v</I>ahy&acirc;i tanuy&ecirc;) might flourish in the graces of the Good Mind, the Holy Sovereignty, and the Sacred Order, till they were blessed with the u<I>s</I>t&acirc;, the summum bonum.</p>  
<p>11. He here prays all the grand abstractions, Piety, the Righteous Order (which alone can 'push on' the settlements), the Good Mind of God within His people, and His kingdom, to turn their mental ears and listen, and listening to pardon.</p>  
<p>12. And specifying the one central object of desire, the Thrift-law, the Avesta of the Ratu, or Saoshya<I>n</I>t, he asks Ahura to arise to his help and give him spiritual strength by sustaining him through the inspiring Righteousness and the Good Mind, in an effective invocation.</p>  
<p>13. With a spirituality still deeper than his Semitic colleague, he asks, not to see the person of God, but His nature, and especially to be able to comprehend and bring home to his mind what the Sovereignty of God implies with its 'blessed rewards.' And he asks of Piety as first acquired, practised, and then speaking within him, to reveal the Gnosis, the Insight, that is, the Religion.</p>  
<p>14. After the fervent language of the previous verses we may accept verse 14 as a legitimate continuation. Its 'Zarathu<I>s</I>tra' may mean 'I' just as 'David' is used by the Psalmist for 'me.' And the language can mean nothing but a dedication of all that he is and has to God, his flesh, his body, his religious eminence, the obedience which he offers in word and deed, inspired by Righteousness, and the Kingdom which he has succeeded in saving and blessing. (I do not think that I have at all exaggerated the grasp and fervour of this section. Less could not be. said, if the words are to be allowed their natural weight.)</FONT></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_357"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_358">72:4</A> So the Pahlavi also indicates: Val valman &icirc; <I>s</I>ap&icirc;r&#8212;<I>k</I>&acirc;shi<I>s</I>n. Ner. uttamasya v&acirc; &acirc;sv&acirc;dayanti dehina<I>h</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_363"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_364">73:4</A> The Pahlavi may be rendered as follows: He who affords increase to the righteous on account of the relationship [that is, something is given to him?] does so also on account of the labourer's duty, or class [that is, the labourer is to be considered as his own] Through the loyalty; that is, the loyal class, that which adheres to A&ucirc;harmazd, he has a thorough understanding as to what is (true) energy toward the herds.

<P><A NAME="fn_366"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_367">73:7</A> Possibly this severity was the cause of the later high reputation of the Zarathu<I>s</I>trians for veracity.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_368"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_369">73:9</A> The Pahlavi may be rendered: Him who will not listen to <A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A> Thee, O A&ucirc;harmazd! will I abjure, and Ak&ocirc;man also, for by him there is the despising of relations, and the deception of the labouring men who live close at hand [that is, of neighbours].

<P><A NAME="fn_370"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_371">74:2</A> Sraosha (= listening obedience) is the greatest for help, because by a M&atilde;thra which appeals to him the way to Ahura is found out (XXVIII, 6) and the Demon defeated.

<P><A NAME="fn_373"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_374">74:5</A> The Pahlavi translator seems to have seen an imperative in av&acirc;, rendering it freely a&icirc;yy&acirc;r&icirc;n&ecirc;<I>d</I>&#335;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_374"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_375">74:6</A> Y&acirc; may be an instr. sing. or an acc. pl. neut. 'I ask what he thought meet to be done;' y&acirc; does not necessarily equal yen, in every instance.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_375"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_376">74:7</A> I need hardly remind the reader that agriculture was the great question of orderly and religious life with the Zarathu<I>s</I>trians. Without it there was of course no resource but wandering and plunder for them.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_376"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_377">75:1</A> So I render from the context. Otherwise see t&acirc; t&ocirc;i izy&acirc; in the previous verse.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_377"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_378">75:2</A> I was formerly inclined to understand Ahura here, Indian usage permitting. (Indra and other Gods are maghavan.) But modern authority, aided by the ancient Pahlavi translator, brings me to a better mind. The Pahlavi has pavan frav&ocirc;n mag&icirc;h. It is better to refer the word to the disciple. The more prominent members of the congregation are meant.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_378"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_379">75:3</A> Ner. renders the last line thus: And may these offerings be manifest in the midst of us, and accompanied with (sincerest) worship.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_379"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_380">75:4</A> There are certain cases where allowance for an ancient scholar working under great disadvantages becomes a critical necessity. Here the Pahlavi translator was clearly the victim of a manuscript. The word '&acirc;id&ucirc;m' (sic) stood, as similar words so often stand, in his MS. as '&acirc;i. d&ucirc;m.' Deeply imbued with a superstitious regard for every letter, and with a public equally scrupulous, he saw no course before him but to translate each as best he could. He chose to render '&acirc;i' by an infinitive, preserving the root, and could only think of a form of 'd&acirc;' for d&ucirc;m (so also moderns in another case). Many writers, seeing such a step, cast away his paper, regarding themselves as absolved by such a 'blunder' from mastering his translations. But a little honest labour will always bring one back to sounder exegesis. In the next following verse we have identically the same form in another word, which he renders awkwardly but correctly, using d&acirc; again, but as a proper auxiliary.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_380"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_381">76:1</A> To approach the offering of a praiser seems certainly an unnatural expression. I think that we are obliged to regard khshm&acirc;vat&ocirc; as another way of saying Yourself rather than 'of Yours'; and if it equals 'Yourself' here, it may elsewhere; see XXXIV, 2, khshm&acirc;vat&ocirc; vahm&ecirc;, also XLIV, 1, nem<I>e</I> khshm&acirc;vat&ocirc;. All acknowledge mavait&ecirc; to mean 'to me.' H&uuml;bschmann, Casuslehre, s. 200: 'dass ich mit frommem sinne an eure Verehrung, Mazda, gehen kann.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_381"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_382">76:2</A> It is curious that draon&ocirc; seems to be in apposition here. The word is used merely in the sense of offering in the later Avesta. It might possibly mean 'possessions' here.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_382"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_383">76:3</A> See XXXII, 15. There helping princes are spoken of 'as borne by the two (Haurvat&acirc;<I>t</I> and Ameretat&acirc;<I>t</I>).' Here in immediate connection with the same two it is said: Let one bear the spirit of the two united chiefs. By the term 'spirit,' which sounds so suspiciously modern, we must nevertheless understand very nearly what the word would mean in a modern phrase. By these two leaders we may understand either <I>G</I>&acirc;m&acirc;spa and V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa (XLIX, 9) or <I>G</I>&acirc;m&acirc;spa and Frashao<I>s</I>tra.

<P><A NAME="fn_385"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_386">76:6</A> The Pahlavi gives its evidence for an instrumental and for a less pronounced meaning than the one above.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_386"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_387">76:7</A> Hamkar<I>d</I>&acirc;r&icirc;h. If the second kar is the root, the sense is figurative.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_395"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_396">77:9</A> Observe that all the Amesh&ocirc;spends, except the two mentioned in verse 8, are here bidden as persons to listen and be merciful.

<P><A NAME="fn_396"></A><A HREF="sbe31011.htm#fr_397">78:1</A> We seem obliged to suppose that Ahura was poetically conceived of as sitting (like Voh&ucirc;man in Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d XIX, 31 (Wg.)) upon an ornamented throne, or we may take the expression as pure metaphor equalling 'exert Thy power.<font size="-1" color="green">'</font> &Acirc;ramait&icirc; may be a voc.</P>
