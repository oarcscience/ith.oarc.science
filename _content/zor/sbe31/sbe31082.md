### VISPARAD V (SP. VI) <span id="fr_1437"></span>[2](#fn_1424).

1\. I come to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! as a praiser priest, and
invoker, as a memoriser, reciting (Your ritual), and as a chanter for
Your sacrifice and homage, Your propitiation, and Your praise; (yea, for
Yours) the Bountiful Immortals, and for our preparation, (O ye holy
Saoshya*n*ts!) and for your well-timed prayer for blessings, and your
sanctification, and for our victorious smiting of our foes, beneficial
(as it is) for our souls, for ours, the Saoshya*n*ts, (with you), and
holy. 2. And I make my offering to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals, who
rule aright, and who dispose (of all) aright! (Yea), I offer You the
flesh of my very body, and all the blessings of my life as well.

3\. And I confess my belief in Thee, O Ahura

Faith.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1424"></span>[344:2](sbe31082.htm#fr_1437) This piece
should be read after Yasna XIV, with which it is nearly identical. The
language of the translation is slightly varied to relieve the effect of
sameness.
