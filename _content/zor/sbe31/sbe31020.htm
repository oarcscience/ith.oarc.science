<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The most striking circumstance here, after the rhetorical and moral-religious peculiarities have been observed, is the sixth verse; and as to the question of Zarathu<I>s</I>trian authorship, it is the most striking in the G&acirc;thas or the Avesta. In that verse we have Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, not named alone, which might easily be harmonised</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">with his personal authorship, nor have we only such expressions as 'to Zarathu<I>s</I>tra and to us' (Y. XXVIII, 7), but we have Zarathu<I>s</I>tra named as 'mahy&acirc; r&acirc;z<I>e</I><I>n</I>g s&acirc;h&icirc;<I>t</I>,' 'may he declare my regulations,<font size="-1" color="green">'</font> which could only be said, without figure of speech, by some superior, if not by the prime mover himself. Were these verses then written by the prime mover? And was he other than Zarathu<I>s</I>tra? If so, the entire mass of the G&acirc;thas was of course written by him, or else their style and character may be regarded as of such a character that they could have been composed by four or five closely connected individuals. But while verses here and there are doubtless the productions of secondary persons, the mass of the G&acirc;thas cannot be regarded as the work of several different composers. They are one man's work, directly or indirectly. If then the present section, which is especially original in its tone, was not from Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, the man whose heart and soul, and, we may add, whose power were in Zarathu<I>s</I>trianism, was not Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, but some unnamed individual far more important. (See note on Y. XXVIII, 7.) The prominence of the name of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra was in that case solely owing to the personal activity of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra supported by the social rank of the Spit&acirc;mas. Zarathu<I>s</I>tra was a princely disciple, on the hypothesis mentioned, and nothing more. The real author of Zarathu<I>s</I>trianism was, in that case, in no sense Zarathu<I>s</I>tra; compare 'to Zarathu<I>s</I>tra and to us:' nor yet V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa; compare 'to V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa and to me:' nor Frashao<I>s</I>tra; compare 'to Frashao<I>s</I>tra and to us;' and, we may also say, not <I>G</I>&acirc;m&acirc;spa, for he is addressed in the vocative. He was mentally and personally the superior of all of them. In fact he was the power behind both throne and home, and yet without a name! But, in that case, what becomes of Y. XXIX, 6, 8? Is it probable that the founder of a religion (or of a new departure in a religion) would describe another as the chosen of God, if he were not in fact supposed to be thus eminent? Or, if a popular and sincerely enthusiastic religious composer were about to chant a hymn at a meeting of the religious masses, would he be likely to name a person to the animated throngs, whom they themselves did not feel to be the life of their religious faith? especially, if that person were not prominent from the arbitrary circumstance that he was the reigning prince? I do not think that this is at all probable. But if Zarathu<I>s</I>tra had, as described, the leading name, and composed a portion of the hymns with their lost companions, is it probable that he possessed no decided prominence in this matter above V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa, Frashao<I>s</I>tra, and <I>G</I>&acirc;m&acirc;spa? Was there no central poet, who</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">composed the mass of the metrical lore, dominating by his influence those who added portions here and there, or was there a quaternion of seers, four Zarathu<I>s</I>tras, as one might say? As we have said, the hymns decide it. One man's soul is in them, as a composer's feelings are in his compositions, or a master's feelings are in the lines of his disciples. But if there was one central figure instead of four, and he is mentioned as Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, and as the spokesman in many portions of the G&acirc;thas, being likewise known by inference to be the composer of nearly all of them, how can we account for the words, 'let him, Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, teach or proclaim my regulations?' Can the verse be regarded as put into the mouth of Ahura, as elsewhere? Hardly, for Ahura is addressed in it. I can therefore only repeat of this verse, as of the others which present analogous questions in Y. XXVIII (with which this chapter L stands in the closest connection), that this thoroughly original piece was composed by Zarathu<I>s</I>tra as by far the most prominent individual in the religious struggle, dominating his party essentially and positively, and that these verses (6-11) were simply rhetorically put into the mouth of the monarch from the exigency of the style of composition. And I conclude that V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa was supposed to speak them, because in the presence of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, it is extremely improbable that any one but the titular head of the State should have been represented as saying of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, 'mahy&acirc; r&acirc;z<I>e</I><I>n</I>g s&acirc;h&icirc;<I>t</I>.'</p>  
<p>1. The piece from Y. XLIX, 52 to Y. L, 1-5 joins well on with Y. XLIX, although the tone is brighter. As he begins with questions in Y. XLVIII, 8-11, after the prospective prayers of Y. XLVIII, 1-7, in which he looks forward to a crisis in the armed struggle, so now after the hostile chief has got the upper hand, he cries out once more with interrogatives, uttering the questions, not of curiosity, but of mournful devotion.</p>  
<p>'The storm has broken over us,' so he would seem to say, 'and I have prayed for grace to know how we may administer (Y. XLIV, 9) the all-powerful means of help, the Da&ecirc;na, in which Thy Righteous Order is set (Y. XLIX, 3). I have cried to Thee for chief and peer (verse 7), naming Frashao<I>s</I>tra, <I>G</I>&acirc;m&acirc;spa, and the Y&acirc;hin, and now, while I invoke you, praying for what in your selection is the best (Y. XXVIII, 11; Y. XLIV, 10), I would more than ever declare that I have none other help than Thee and Thy saving Order.' 2. And he asks once more to know how he who seeks to further the sacred herds, as the emblem of the moral thrift of the provinces, should proceed in his allotted work. 3. Answering his own question, he says that it is by advance upon the enemy; he declares</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">that the heroic settler who pushes the holy system to the utmost verge of the sacred territory or still further, was the man 'to gain the Kine' for the seeking prophet. 4. But in the midst of struggles, he anticipates Gar&ocirc;<I>d</I>man with its praises. 5. For they were all prepared for both worship and work, since God had approached to aid His prophet, encouraging His discouraged spirit. 6. Here V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa is represented as intervening; and he addresses Ahura literally, but Zarathu<I>s</I>tra really, exhorting him indirectly to continue on in his work of propagation, undismayed by present circumstances. 7. And with Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, he would re-engage the other powerful helpers, whom he would yoke on as steeds to gain God's praise in Heaven by passing over every bridge of trial safely. 8. Having heard from Zarathu<I>s</I>tra his metric words, he will approach with them to pray, and, as in Y. XXVIII, 2, 3, 'with hands stretched out' with homage, and with vigour. 9. And he looks to attain the object of his prayers by religious self-control, and faithful action. 10. His efforts vie with the heavenly bodies in their praise of God. 11. Therefore he will persevere, and as a praiser-king (so the Pahlavi in one place); and he beseeches that Ahura, the life-giver, may help on the all-engrossing cause.</FONT></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_755"></A><A HREF="sbe31020.htm#fr_756">170:1</A> This verse is placed here as obviously more closely related to chapter L than to chapter XLIX. Lost verses may, however, have intervened between it and Y. L, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_756"></A><A HREF="sbe31020.htm#fr_757">170:2</A> Another rendering, regarding ka<I>t</I> as a purely interrogative participle, would be, 'Are they (t&ocirc;i) helpful to the invoking Zarathu<I>s</I>tra?' But ka<I>t</I> t&ocirc;i is a familiar form; see Y. XXXIV, 12, where it must mean quid tibi.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_757"></A><A HREF="sbe31020.htm#fr_758">171:1</A> I should be far from denying that azd&acirc; may equal addh&acirc;&acute;, but a strengthening adverb seems to me of no particular force here. I formerly rested at the simple explanation az + d&acirc; = dh&acirc; = desire-exciting, much desired one. But the Pahlavi translator affords an explanation which may surpass that of his successors. He sees the meaning: 'When I shall call upon You,' (that is, freely, 'being invoked,') 'cause Thou (sic) me to understand fully.' This is the remnant of some predecessor's work who rendered 'tell ye me;' az = ah, otherwise lost in Zend. The plural follows the singular too often to excite much doubt; azd&acirc; = tell ye; so zd&icirc; is from az, as sy&ocirc;d&ucirc;m is from as (recall the well-known Indian analogies). See also the explanation of the Pahlavi at Y. XXXI, 17. If a plural cannot be admitted, then consider a form extended by d.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_760"></A><A HREF="sbe31020.htm#fr_761">171:4</A> I can hardly agree to the rendering 'among people who see the sun' without a needless reconstruction of the text.

<p>'When the soul of the pious passes over that Bridge, the width of <A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A> that Bridge becomes about one league' (West, Mainy&ocirc;-&icirc; Khard,* p. 134). Possibly the extension of the Bridge for the pious arose from the plural use here.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_779"></A><A HREF="sbe31020.htm#fr_781">174:5</A> The Pahlavi translator accepts a ser se of acquisition here as well as of desire: A&ecirc;t&ucirc;n&#335; zak &icirc; valman &icirc; av&#335; h&ucirc;-d&acirc;n&acirc;k pavan khvah&icirc;<I>s</I>n&#335; gr&icirc;ft&acirc;r h&ocirc;man&acirc;n&icirc; [mozd]. I accede to its indication, holding that gardh certainly has such an element in its meaning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_780"></A><A HREF="sbe31020.htm#fr_782">175:1</A> I can here only follow the words as they are written; the meaning is clear enough although rather advanced. Reconstructions on a large scale are seldom of value.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_781"></A><A HREF="sbe31020.htm#fr_783">175:2</A> Judging from the context, we may render ar<I>g</I>a<I>t</I> thus.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_782"></A><A HREF="sbe31020.htm#fr_784">175:3</A> The Pahlavi translator here renders as if he read ush&acirc;. In Y. XLVI, 3 he translates ukhsh&acirc;n&ocirc;. Professor Wilhelm, preferring as above, still recalls the Homeric usage favouring 'increaser.' The Pahlavi has vakhsh&icirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r in Y. XLVI, 3.
