*The Zend Avesta, Part III (SBE31)*, L.H. Mills, tr. \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### IX.

1\. The Ahuna-vairya is a prayer to be (revered and) chosen as the
choice one of Mazda. The Khshathra-vairya is likewise such, and the Yâ
daêna <span id="fr_1608"></span>[3](#fn_1577). They (it) will gain the
reward. Yathâ ahû vairyô. It is the word of Mazda. They are the words in
season. It is the Mãthra-spe*n*ta word, the unsubdued, the undeceived,
the victorious, the opponent of malice, the healing and victorious word
of Mazda, which, as it is pronounced <span
id="fr_1609"></span>[4](#fn_1578), gives most the victory to him who
utters it. 2. I have declared the hymn which is most helpful and
victorious against the words of Aêshma, which is health-giving and
healing, and conducive to progress, the multiplier, and the furtherer of
growth. And let the worshipper present it with a liberal offering . . .
. with its pleasing words. Let that be done through veritable grace
which helps us on the most <span id="fr_1610"></span>[5](#fn_1579). The
Kingdom (is) to Ahura, which to the poor may grant a nurturer <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[6](#fn_1580).
