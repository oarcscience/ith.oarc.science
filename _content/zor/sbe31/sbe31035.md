### YASNA XIII (SP. XIV).

#### INVOCATIONS AND DEDICATIONS.

1\. I address (my invocation to) Ahura Mazda. And I invoke (among
guardian beings) the chief <span id="fr_1051"></span>[3](#fn_1045) of

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

the house-lord, and the chief of the Vîs-lord <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[1](#fn_1046), and the chief of the
Za*n*tu-lord <span id="fr_1053"></span>[2](#fn_1047). And I invoke the
chief of the province-lord <span id="fr_1054"></span>[3](#fn_1048). And
the chief of women I invoke, the Mazdayasnian Faith, the blessed and
good Pare*n*di <span id="fr_1055"></span>[4](#fn_1049), her who is the
holy one of human-kind <span id="fr_1056"></span>[5](#fn_1050). And I
invoke this (holy) earth which bears us.

2\. And I invoke the friendly and most helpful person's <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[6](#fn_1051) lord, the Fire of Ahura Mazda, and
also the most energetic lords of holy men, those who are most
strenuous <span id="fr_1058"></span>[7](#fn_1052) in their care of
cattle and the fields, and the chief of the thrifty tiller of the earth.
And I invoke the steady settler <span id="fr_1059"></span>[8](#fn_1053)
of sanctity, (and) the chief of the charioteer.

3\. And I invoke the chief of the fire-priest by means of the most
imposing sciences of the Mazdayasnian Faith. And I invoke the chief of
the Âtharvan, and his pupils I invoke; yea, the lords of each of them. I
invoke these lords, and I summon the Bountiful Immortals here, and the
Prophets who shall serve us, the wisest as they are, the most scrupulous

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

in their exactness (as) they utter words (of doctrine and of service),
the most devoted (to their duties likewise), and the most glorious in
their thoughts (?) <span id="fr_1060"></span>[1](#fn_1054). And I invoke
the most imposing forces of the Mazdayasnian Faith, and the fire-priests
I invoke, and the charioteers, the warriors, and the thrifty tillers of
the soil.

4\. And to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! Ye who rule aright, and
dispose (of all) aright, I offer the flesh of my very frame, and all the
blessings of my life.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Thus <span id="fr_1061"></span>[2](#fn_1055) the two spirits <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[3](#fn_1056) thought, thus they spoke, and thus
they did;

5\. And therefore as Thou, O Ahura Mazda! didst think, speak, dispose,
and do all things good (for us), so to Thee would we give, so would we
assign to Thee our homage; so would we worship Thee with our sacrifices.
So would we bow before Thee with these gifts, and so direct our prayers
to Thee with confessions of our debt.

6\. By the kinship of the good kindred <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[4](#fn_1057), by that of Righteousness the good
(Thy righteous servant's nature) would we approach Thee, and by that of
the good thrift-law, and of Piety the good.

7\. And we would worship the Fravashi of the Kine of blessed gift <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[5](#fn_1058), and that of the holy Gaya Maretan,
and we would worship the holy Fravashi <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[6](#fn_1059)

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

of Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma, the saint. Yea, that one of beings do we
worship whose better (service) in the sacrifice Ahura Mazda knows; (even
those women do we worship) whose <span id="fr_1066"></span>[1](#fn_1060)
(better service thus is known). Yea, both (holy) men and women (do we
worship whom Ahura Mazda knows <span id="fr_1067"></span>[2](#fn_1061)).
As the Ahû is excelling, so is our Ratu, one who rules from the
Righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness, and of life's actions
done for Mazda; and the Kingdom is to Ahura which to the poor (may
offer) nurture <span id="fr_1068"></span>[2](#fn_1061).

A blessing is the Right called the best, there is weal, there is weal to
this (man), when toward Righteousness Best (he does) right <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[2](#fn_1061).

8\. We worship the Ahuna-vairya; and we worship Asha Vahi*s*ta the
best(?), the bountiful Immortal. And we sacrifice to the Hâ fraoreti,
even to the confession and laudation of the Mazdayasnian Faith!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1045"></span>[250:3](sbe31035.htm#fr_1051) This Ratu is the
description and representation of the Nmânôpaiti as occupying the
attention of the worshippers chiefly at the time of his mention in the
course of the ritual. (I vary the expression 'chief' with that of 'lord'
here for the sake of change.) Once established as a Ratu in the ritual,
he became a guardian genius Nmânya; so of the others. (Y. XIII is in the
Gâthic dialect.)

<span id="fn_1046"></span>[251:1](sbe31035.htm#fr_1052) Vîsya.

<span id="fn_1047"></span>[251:2](sbe31035.htm#fr_1053) Za*n*tuma.

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[251:3](sbe31035.htm#fr_1054) Da*hv*yuma =
Dahyuma.

<span id="fn_1049"></span>[251:4](sbe31035.htm#fr_1055) The goddess of
riches.

<span id="fn_1050"></span>[251:5](sbe31035.htm#fr_1056) Lit. biped; see
elsewhere where quadruped means merely beast.

<span id="fn_1051"></span>[251:6](sbe31035.htm#fr_1057) Or,
'households.'

<span id="fn_1052"></span>[251:7](sbe31035.htm#fr_1058) Ashethwôzgatemã
(several manuscripts have ashe) finds its explanation from the Pahlavi
of Dastur Hoshang*g*i *G*âmâsp*g*i's MS. it may be read kabed ran*g*
rasi*s*ntûm instead of kabed yôm rasi*s*ntûm. The ancient error of yôm
arose from the fact that the copyist had before him a form which might
be read either rô*g* or ran*g*, the characters being identical for
either word. He could not reconcile himself to ran*g* in the sense of
effort, and so decided for rô*g*; but in order to guide his successors
aright, he changed it for its synonym yôm, which, as Spiegel well
remarks, affords but little sense. But the word is ran*g*, as I believe,
and this is at once corroborated by Ner.'s bahukle*s*a. Read a*s* +
thwakh*s*a + gatemã = kabed + ran*g* + rasi*s*ntûm, the most progressing
with painful energy.

<span id="fn_1053"></span>[251:8](sbe31035.htm#fr_1059) Or, 'steadiest
forces.'

<span id="fn_1054"></span>[252:1](sbe31035.htm#fr_1060)I should think
that the reference was here to khratavŏ, Y. XLVI, 3. See Y. XXXII, 14,
as alternatively rendered.

<span id="fn_1055"></span>[252:2](sbe31035.htm#fr_1061) A portion of the
text has here fallen out.

<span id="fn_1056"></span>[252:3](sbe31035.htm#fr_1062) The recognition
of a strong dualism here is imperative. Ahura alone is praised.

<span id="fn_1057"></span>[252:4](sbe31035.htm#fr_1063) Or, 'of the good
kinsman, the lord (?).'

<span id="fn_1058"></span>[252:5](sbe31035.htm#fr_1064) Elsewhere
meaning 'meat,' just as Ameretatâ*t* and Haurvatâ*t* mean wood and
water.

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[252:6](sbe31035.htm#fr_1065) Or, 'sanctity
and the Fravashi.'

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[253:1](sbe31035.htm#fr_1066) Feminine.

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[253:2](sbe31035.htm#fr_1069) Elsewhere with
verbal difference.
