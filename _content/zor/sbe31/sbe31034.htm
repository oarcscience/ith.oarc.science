<p>the Lord, a praiser&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1038"></A><A HREF="#fn_1032"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the Bountiful Immortals; and to Ahura Mazda, the good and endowed with good possessions, I attribute all things good, to the holy One, the resplendent, to the glorious, whose are all things whatsoever which are good; whose is the Kine, whose is Asha (the righteous order pervading all things pure), whose are the stars, in whose lights the glorious beings and objects are clothed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1039"></A><A HREF="#fn_1033"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>2. And I choose Piety, the bounteous and the good, mine may she be&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1040"></A><A HREF="#fn_1034"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. And therefore I loudly (deprecate all robbery&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1041"></A><A HREF="#fn_1035"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and violence against the sacred) Kine, and all drought&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1042"></A><A HREF="#fn_1036"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> to the wasting of the Mazdayasnian villages.</p>  
<p>3. Away from (?) their thoughts do I wish to lead (the thought of) wandering at will, (away the thought of) free nomadic pitching of the tent, for I wish to remove (?) all wandering from&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1043"></A><A HREF="#fn_1037"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> (their) Kine which abide in steadfastness upon this land; and bowing down in worship to Righteousness I dedicate my offerings with praise so far as that. Never may I stand as a source of wasting, never as a source of withering to the Mazdayasnian villages, not for the love&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1044"></A><A HREF="#fn_1038"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> of body or of life.</p>

<p>5. Off, off, do I abjure the Da&ecirc;vas and all possessed by them, the sorcerers and all that hold to their devices, and every existing being of the sort; their thoughts do I abjure, their words and actions, and their seed (that propagate their sin); away do I abjure their shelter and their headship, and the iniquitous of every kind who act as Rakhshas act!</p>  
<p>Thus and so in very deed might Ahura Mazda have indicated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1045"></A><A HREF="#fn_1039"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to Zarathu<I>s</I>tra in every question which Zarathu<I>s</I>tra asked, and in all the consultations in the which they two conversed together. 6. Thus and so might Zarathu<I>s</I>tra have abjured the shelter and the headship of the Da&ecirc;vas in all the questions, and in all the consultations with which they two conversed together, Zarathu<I>s</I>tra and the Lord.</p>  
<p>And so I myself, in whatsoever circumstances I may be placed, as a worshipper of Mazda, and of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra's order, would so abjure the Da&ecirc;vas and their shelter, as he who&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1046"></A><A HREF="#fn_1040"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> was the holy Zarathu<I>s</I>tra abjured them (once of old).</p>

<p>to that sanctity do I. Of that creed which Zarathu<I>s</I>tra held, which Kavi V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa, and those two, Frashao<I>s</I>tra and <I>G</I>&acirc;m&acirc;spa; yea, of that religious faith which every Saoshya<I>n</I>t who shall (yet come to) save (us), the holy ones who do the deeds of real significance, of that creed, and of that lore, am I.</p>  
<p>8. A Mazda-worshipper I am, of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra's order; (so) do I confess, as a praiser and confessor, and I therefore praise aloud the well-thought thought, the word well spoken, and the deed well done;</p>  
<p>9. Yea, I praise at once the Faith of Mazda, the Faith which has no faltering utterance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1049"></A><A HREF="#fn_1043"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the Faith that wields the felling halbert&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1050"></A><A HREF="#fn_1044"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the Faith of kindred marriage, the holy (Creed), which is the most imposing, best, and most beautiful of all religions which exist, and of all that shall in future come to knowledge, Ahura's Faith, the Zarathu<I>s</I>trian creed. Yea, to Ahura Mazda do I ascribe all good, and such shall be the worship of the Mazdayasnian belief!</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1030"></A><A HREF="sbe31034.htm#fr_1036">247:4</A> This piece in the G&acirc;thic dialect has claims to higher antiquity next after the Haptangh&acirc;iti. Its retrospective cast shows that it is later than the original period. Verse 7 savours of a later date with its reference to the plants and waters. That Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, Kavi V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa, Frashao<I>s</I>tra, and <I>G</I>&acirc;m&acirc;spa are named by no means proves that they were still living.
