### YASNA XVI (SP. XVII).

#### THE SACRIFICE CONTINUES WITH INCREASED FULNESS OF EXPRESSION.

1\. We worship Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the ritual order, who
disposes (all) aright, the greatest Yazad, who is also the most
beneficent, and the one who causes the settlements to advance, the
creator of good creatures; yea, we worship Him with these offered
Zaothras, and with truthfully and scrupulously delivered words; and we
worship every holy Yazad of the heaven (as well)!

2\. And we worship Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma in our sacrifice, the holy lord
of the ritual order with these Zaothras, and with faithfully delivered
words; and we worship every holy earthly Yazad as we worship him; and we
worship also the Fravashi of Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma, the saint. And we
worship the utterances of Zarathu*s*tra and his religion, his faith and
his lore.

3\. And we worship the former religions of the world <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[2](#fn_1072) devoted to Righteousness which were
instituted

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

at the creation, the holy religions of the Creator Ahura Mazda, the
resplendent and glorious. And we worship Vohu Manah (the Good Mind), and
Asha Vahi*s*ta (who is Righteousness the Best), and Khshathra-vairya,
the Kingdom to be desired, and the good and bountiful Âramaiti (true
piety in the believers), and Haurvatâ*t* and Ameretatâ*t* (our Weal and
Immortality).

4\. Yea, we worship the Creator Ahura Mazda and the Fire, Ahura Mazda's
son, and the good waters which are Mazda-made and holy, and the
resplendent sun of the swift horses, and the moon with the seed of
cattle (in his beams <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1](#fn_1073)); and we
worship the star Ti*s*trya, the lustrous and glorious; and we worship
the soul of the Kine of blessed endowment, (5) and its Creator Ahura
Mazda; and we worship Mithra of the wide pastures, and Sraosha
(Obedience) the blessed, and Rashnu the most just, and the good, heroic,
bountiful Fravashis of the saints, and the Blow-of-victory Ahura-given
(as it is). And we worship Râman *Hv*âstra, and the bounteous Wind of
blessed gift, (6) and (its) Creator Ahura Mazda, and the good
Mazdayasnian Religion, and the good Blessedness and Ar*s*tâ*t*.

And we worship the heaven and the earth of blessed gift, and the
bounteous Mãthra, and the stars without beginning (to their course),
self-disposing as they are.

7\. And we worship the glorious works of Righteousness in which the
souls of the dead find satisfaction and delight \[(Pâzand) which are the
Fravashis

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

of the saints\], and we worship (Heaven) the best world of the saints,
shining, all glorious.

8\. And we worship the two, the milk-offering and the libation, the two
which cause the waters to flow forth <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1](#fn_1074), and the plants to flourish, the two
foes who meet the Dragon <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1](#fn_1074)
demon-made; and who are set to meet, to defeat, and to put to flight,
that cheat <span id="fr_1084"></span>[2](#fn_1075), the Pairika, and to
contradict the insulting malice of the Ashemaogha (the persecuting
heretic) and that of the unholy tyrant full of death <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[3](#fn_1076).

9\. And we worship all waters and all plants, and all good men and all
good women. And we worship all these Yazads, heavenly and earthly <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[4](#fn_1077), who are beneficent and holy.

10\. And we worship thee (our) dwelling-place who art the (earth, our)
bounteous Âramaiti <span id="fr_1087"></span>[5](#fn_1078), and Thee, O
Ahura Mazda, O holy Lord of this abode <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[6](#fn_1079)! which is the home of healthy herds
and healthy men, and of those who are both endowed with health and
lover(s) of the ritual right.

(Response of the individual worshipper (?).) Wherefore whichever of
persons, or whatever of bodily influences, is most helpful and
preserving in that abode (thus owned by Mazda) let this meet me in mine
abode, and there may it abide for summer and for winter. (Or <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[7](#fn_1080) let that one meet me in all my house,

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

in whom are what of influences are the most mighty power for the body
and the person's life; yea, let that one meet me there, and there abide
for summer and for winter (for my help)!)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[255:2](sbe31038.htm#fr_1080) So the Pahlavi
translator, probably reading angheu*s*; otherwise <span id="page_256">p.
256</span> 'of the conscience that loves the right.' In Ya*s*t XIII, 118
the word is a proper name through an error.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[256:1](sbe31038.htm#fr_1081) Possibly in

saptá síndhûn.

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[257:2](sbe31038.htm#fr_1084) Or is it
possible that a plague of mice is meant, mû*s* being here indeclinable?

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[257:3](sbe31038.htm#fr_1085) Ordering the
execution of many of his subjects.

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[257:4](sbe31038.htm#fr_1086) Gaêthyâ*k*a with

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[257:6](sbe31038.htm#fr_1088) Originally
