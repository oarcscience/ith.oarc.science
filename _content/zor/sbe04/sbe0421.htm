<p>2 (4). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;There are five such sins, O holy Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! It is the first of these sins that men commit when a man teaches one of the faithful a foreign, wrong creed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_917"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, a foreign wrong law, and he does so with a full knowledge and conscience of the sin: this is a sin that makes him a Pesh&ocirc;tanu.</p>

<p>3 (9). &#8216;It is the second of these sins that men commit when a man gives too hard bones or too hot food to a shepherd's dog or to a house dog;</p>  
<p>4 (11). &#8216;If the bones stick in the dog's teeth or stop in his throat, or if the hot food burn his mouth or his tongue, so that mischief follows therefrom, and the dog dies, this is a sin that makes the man a Pesh&ocirc;tanu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_918"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>5 (16). &#8216;It is the third of these sins that men commit when a man smites a bitch big with young or affrights her by running after her, with shouting or with clapping of hands&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_919"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;</p>  
<p>6 (18). &#8216;If the bitch fall into a hole, or a well, or a precipice, or a river, or a canal, so that mischief follows therefrom, and she dies, this is a sin that makes the man a Pesh&ocirc;tanu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="#fn_920"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>7 (22). &#8216;It is the fourth of these sins that men commit when a man has intercourse with a woman who has an issue of blood, either out of the ordinary course or at the usual period: this is a sin that makes him a Pesh&ocirc;tanu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="#fn_921"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>
