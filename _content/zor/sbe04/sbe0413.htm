<p>This chapter would offer tolerable unity, but for a digression on medicine, which would be better placed as an introduction to the last three chapters, Sections II and IX, parts of which have already been found in Fargard V, are more suitably placed here. This chapter, as a whole, deals with the action of the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu, from the moment she takes hold of the corpse, and shows how and when the several objects she has defiled become clean, namely, clothes, wood, corn, earth, women, vessels, and cows.</FONT></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">I.</h3>  
<p>1. Zarathu<I>s</I>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material</p>

<p>2 (3). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;Directly after death, as soon as the soul has left the body, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu comes and rushes upon him, from the regions of the north&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_621"></A><A HREF="#fn_616"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_622"></A><A HREF="#fn_617"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

When the dog has seen it or eaten it up, or when the flesh-eating birds have taken flight towards it, then the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu rushes away to the regions of the north in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.']</p>  
<p>4 (5). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If the man has been killed by a dog, or by a wolf, or by witchcraft, or by the artifices of hatred&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_625"></A><A HREF="#fn_620"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, or by falling down a precipice, or by the law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_626"></A><A HREF="#fn_621"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, or by a murderer, or by the noose&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_627"></A><A HREF="#fn_622"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, how long after death does the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu come and rush upon the dead?</p>

Ahura Mazda answered: 'At the next watch after death&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_628"></A><A HREF="#fn_623"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu comes and rushes upon the dead, from the regions of the north, in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.'</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">II&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_629"></A><A HREF="#fn_624"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</h3>  
<p>6 (7). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be a number of men resting in the same place, on adjoining carpets, on adjoining pillows, be there two men near one another, or five, or fifty, or a hundred, close by one another; and of those people one happens to die; how many of them does the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu envelope with infection, pollution, and uncleanness?</p>  
<p>7 (11). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;If the dead one be a priest, the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! she falls on the eleventh and defiles the ten.</p>  
<p>&#8216;If the dead one be a warrior, the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! she falls on the tenth and defiles the nine.</p>  
<p>&#8216;If the dead one be a husbandman, the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! she falls on the ninth and defiles the eight.</p>  
<p>8 (17). &#8216;If it be a shepherd's dog, the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! she falls on the eighth and defiles the seven.</p>

<p>11 (27). Ahura Mazda answered: 'The Dru<I>g</I> Nasu defiles with infection, uncleanness, and pollution the upper sheet and the inner garment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_633"></A><A HREF="#fn_628"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>12 (28). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can that garment be made clean, O holy Ahura Mazda! that has been touched by the carcase of a dog or the corpse of a man?</p>  
<p>13 (29). Ahura Mazda answered: 'It can, O holy Zarathu<I>s</I>tra!'</p>  
<p>How so?</p>

<p>14 (33). &#8216;But if it has not been defiled with seed, or sweat, or dirt, or vomit, then the worshippers of Mazda shall wash it with g&ocirc;m&ecirc;z.</p>  
<p>15 (35). &#8216;If it be leather, they shall wash it with g&ocirc;m&ecirc;z three times, they shall rub it with earth three times, they shall wash it with water three times, and afterwards they shall expose it to the air for three months at the window of the house.</p>

<p>16 (37). 'The spring named Ardv&icirc; S&ucirc;ra, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! that spring of mine, purifies the seed in man, the fruit in a woman's womb, the milk in a woman's breast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_636"></A><A HREF="#fn_631"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A></p>  
<p>18 (43). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;Never can those clothes, even when washed and cleansed, be used either by a Zaotar, or by a H&acirc;vanan, or by an &Acirc;tare-vakhsha, or by a Frabaretar, or by an &Acirc;bere<I>d</I>, or by an &Acirc;sn&acirc;tar, or by a Rathwi<I>s</I>kar, or by a Sraosh&acirc;-varez, or by any priest, warrior, or husbandman.</p>  
<p>19 (45). &#8216;But if there be in a Mazdean house a woman who is in her sickness, or a man who has become unfit for work, and who must sit in the place of infirmity, those clothes shall serve for their coverings and for their sheets, until they can withdraw and move their hands.</p>  
<p>20 (49). &#8216;Ahura Mazda, indeed, does not allow us to waste anything of value that we may have, not even so much as an Asperena's weight of thread, not even so much as a maid lets fall in spinning.</p>  
<p>21 (52). &#8216;Whosoever throws any clothing on a dead body, even so much as a maid lets fall in spinning, is not a pious man whilst alive, nor shall he, when dead, have a place in the happy realm.</p>  
<p>22 (55). 'He shall go away into the world of the fiends, into that dark world, made of darkness, the offspring of darkness. To that world, to the dismal realm, you are delivered by your own doings, by your own souls, O sinners!'</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">IV.</h3>

<p>38 (99). &#8216;Let him therefore never attend any worshipper of Mazda; let him never treat with the knife any worshipper of Mazda, nor wound him with the knife.
