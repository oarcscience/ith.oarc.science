<p>2 (4). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;They shall look for a Dakhma, they shall look for a Dakhma all around. If they find it easier, to remove the dead than to remove the house, they shall take out the dead, they shall let the house stand, and shall perfume it with Urv&acirc;sni, or Vohu-gaona, or Vohu-kereti, or Hadh&acirc;-na&ecirc;pata, or any other sweet-smelling plant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_682"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>

'If they find it easier to remove the house than to remove the dead&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_683"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, they shall take away the house, they shall let the dead lie on the spot, and shall perfume the house with Urv&acirc;sni, or Vohu-gaona, or Vohu-kereti, or Hadh&acirc;-na&ecirc;pata, or any other sweet-smelling plant.'</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">II.</h3>  
<p>4 (11). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If in the house of a worshipper of Mazda a dog or a man happens to die, and it is raining&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_684"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, or snowing, or blowing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_690"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, or the darkness is coming on, when flocks and men lose their way, what shall the worshippers of Mazda do&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_691"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>?</p>

<p>5 (14). Ahura Mazda answered: 'The place in that house whereof the ground is the cleanest and the driest, and the least passed through by flocks and herds, by Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated bundles of baresma, and by the faithful;'--</p>  
<p>6 (16). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from the fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated bundles of baresma? How far from the faithful?</p>  
<p>7 (17). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;Thirty paces from the fire; thirty paces from the water; thirty paces from the consecrated bundles of baresma; three paces from the faithful;--</p>  
<p>8 (18). &#8216;On that place they shall dig a grave, half a foot deep if the earth be hard, half the height of a man if it be soft; [they shall cover the surface of the grave with ashes or cowdung]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_692"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; they shall cover the surface of it with dust of bricks, of stones, or of dry earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_693"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>9 (21). &#8216;And they shall let the lifeless body lie there, for two nights, or three nights, or a month long, until the birds begin to fly, the plants to grow, the floods to flow, and the wind to dry up the waters from off the earth.</p>  
<p>10 (23). &#8216;And when the birds begin to fly, the plants to grow, the floods to flow, and the wind to dry up the waters from off the earth, then the worshippers of Mazda shall make a breach in the wall</p>

<p>of the house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_694"></A><A HREF="#fn_688"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and they shall call for two men, strong and skilful&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_695"></A><A HREF="#fn_689"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and those, having stripped their clothes off&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_696"></A><A HREF="#fn_690"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, shall take the body to the building of clay, stones, and mortar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_697"></A><A HREF="#fn_691"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, raised on a place where they know there are always corpse-eating dogs and corpse-eating birds.</p>  
<p>11 (29). 'Afterwards the corpse-bearers shall sit down, three paces from the dead; then the holy Ratu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_698"></A><A HREF="#fn_692"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> shall proclaim to the worshippers of Mazda thus: "Let the worshippers of Mazda here bring the urine wherewith the corpse-bearers there shall wash their hair and their bodies!"'</p>  
<p>12 (32). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which is the urine wherewith the corpse-bearers shall wash their hair and their bodies? Is it of sheep or of oxen? Is it of man or of woman?</p>  
<p>13 (35). Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is of sheep or of oxen; not of man nor of woman, except these two: the nearest kinsman (of the dead) or his nearest kinswoman. The worshippers of Mazda</p>

<p>14 (38). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the way, whereon the carcases of dogs or corpses of men have been carried, be passed through again by flocks and herds, by men and women, by Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated bundles of baresma, and by the faithful?</p>  
<p>15 (40). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;It cannot be passed through again by flocks and herds, nor by men and women, nor by Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, nor by the consecrated bundles of baresma, nor by the faithful.</p>  
<p>16 (41). &#8216;You shall therefore cause the yellow dog with four eyes, or the white dog with yellow ears&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_700"></A><A HREF="#fn_694"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, to go three times through that way&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_701"></A><A HREF="#fn_695"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. When either the yellow dog with four eyes, or the white dog with yellow ears, is brought there, then the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu flies away to the regions of the north, in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_702"></A><A HREF="#fn_696"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>dog with yellow ears: to go six times&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_703"></A><A HREF="#fn_697"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> through that way. When either the yellow dog with four eyes, or the white dog with yellow ears, is brought there, then the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu flies away to the regions of the north, in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.</p>  
<p>18 (47). &#8216;If the dog goes unwillingly, they shall cause the yellow dog with four eyes, or the white dog with yellow ears, to go nine times through that way. When either the yellow dog with four eyes, or the white dog with yellow ears, has been brought there, then the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu flies away to the regions of the north, in the shape of a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.</p>  
<p>19 (49). &#8216;An &Acirc;thravan shall first go along the way and shall say aloud these fiend-smiting words: "Yath&acirc; ah&ucirc; vairy&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_704"></A><A HREF="#fn_698"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:--the will of the Lord is the law of holiness; the riches of Vohu-man&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_705"></A><A HREF="#fn_699"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> shall be given to him who works in this world for Mazda, and wields according to the will of Ahura the power he gave to him to relieve the poor.</p>

<p>the fiend is grasping me? Whom but thy &Acirc;tar and Vohu-man&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_706"></A><A HREF="#fn_700"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, by whose work the holy world goes on? Reveal to me the rules of thy law!</p>  
<p>&#8216;&#8220;K<I>e</I> verethrem <I>g</I>&acirc;:--who is he who will smite the fiend in order to maintain thy ordinances? Teach me clearly thy rules for this world and for the next, that Sraosha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_707"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> may come with Vohu-man&ocirc; and help whomsoever thou pleasest.</p>  
<p>21 (60). &#8216;"Keep us from our hater, O Mazda and &Acirc;rmaiti Spe<I>n</I>ta! Perish, O fiendish Dru<I>g</I>! Perish, O brood of the fiend! Perish, O world of the fiend!

<p>22.(63). &#8216;Then the worshippers of Mazda may at their will bring by those ways sheep and oxen, men and women, and Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, the consecrated bundles of baresma, and the faithful.</p>  
<p>'The worshippers of Mazda may afterwards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_708"></A><A HREF="#fn_702"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> prepare meals with meat and wine in that house; it shall be clean, and there will be no sin, as before.'</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">IV.</h3>

<p>Ahura Mazda answered: 'Four hundred stripes with the Aspah&ecirc;-a<I>s</I>tra, four hundred stripes with the Sraosh&ocirc;-<I>k</I>arana.'</p>  
<p>24 (68). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man shall throw clothes, either of skin or woven, upon a dead body, enough to cover both legs, what is the penalty that he shall pay?</p>  
<p>Ahura Mazda answered: 'Six hundred stripes with the Aspah&ecirc;-a<I>s</I>tra, six hundred stripes with the Sraosh&ocirc;-<I>k</I>arana.'</p>  
<p>25 (71). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man shall throw clothes, either of skin or woven, upon a dead body, enough to cover the whole body, what is the penalty that he shall pay?</p>  
<p>Ahura Mazda answered: 'A thousand stripes with the Aspah&ecirc;-a<I>s</I>tra, a thousand stripes with the Sraosh&ocirc;-<I>k</I>arana.'</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">V.</h3>  
<p>26 (74). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man involuntarily emits his seed, what is the penalty that he shall pay?</p>  
<p>Ahura Mazda answered: 'Eight hundred stripes with the Aspah&ecirc;-a<I>s</I>tra, eight hundred stripes with the Sraosh&ocirc;-<I>k</I>arana.'</p>  
<p>27 (77). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man voluntarily emits his seed, what is the penalty for it? What is the atonement for it? What is the cleansing from it?</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_101"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 101</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Ahura Mazda answered: 'For that deed there is nothing that can pay, nothing that can atone, nothing that can cleanse from it; it is a trespass for which there is no atonement, for ever and ever.'</p>  
<p>28 (83). When is it so?</p>  
<p>&#8216;It is so, if the sinner be a professor of the law of Mazda, or one who has been taught in it. But if he be not a professor of the law of Mazda, nor one who has been taught in it, then this law of Mazda takes his sin from him, if he confesses it and resolves never to commit again such forbidden deeds.</p>  
<p>29 (88). &#8216;The law of Mazda indeed, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! takes away from him who confesses it the bonds of his sin; it takes away (the sin of) breach of trust; it takes away (the sin of) murdering one of the faithful; it takes away (the sin of) burying a corpse; it takes away (the sin of) deeds for which there is no atonement; it takes away the heaviest penalties of sin; it takes away any sin that may be sinned.</p>  
<p>30 (95). &#8216;In the same way the law of Mazda, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! cleanses the faithful from every evil thought, word, and deed, as a swift-rushing mighty wind cleanses the plain.</p>  
<p>'So let all the deeds thou doest be henceforth good, O Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! a full atonement for thy sin is effected by means of the law of Mazda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_710"></A><A HREF="#fn_704"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>31 (98). O Maker of the material world, thou only One! Who is the man that is a Da&ecirc;va? Who is he that is a worshipper of the Da&ecirc;va? that is a male paramour of the Da&ecirc;vas? that is a female paramour of the Da&ecirc;vas? that is a she-Da&ecirc;va?</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A></p>

<p>32 (102). Ahura Mazda answered: 'The man that lies with mankind as man lies with womankind, or as woman lies with mankind, is the man that is a Da&ecirc;va; this one is the man that is a worshipper of the Da&ecirc;vas, that is a male paramour of the Da&ecirc;vas, that is a female paramour of the Da&ecirc;va, that is a she-Da&ecirc;va; this is the man that is in his inmost self a Da&ecirc;va, that is in his whole being a Da&ecirc;va; this is the man that is a Da&ecirc;va before he dies, and becomes one of the unseen Da&ecirc;vas after death: so is he, whether he has lain with mankind as mankind, or as womankind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_713"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.'</p>

<p>33 (107). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Shall the man be clean who has touched a corpse that has been dried up and dead more than a year?</p>

<p>How so?</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_705"></A><A HREF="sbe0414.htm#fr_711">102:1</A> The text has a V&icirc;sp&ocirc;-da&ecirc;va, a curious expression which comes from the time when da&ecirc;va still meant 'a god' (see Introd. IV, 4I). In the time of the Indo-Iranian, nay, as early as the time of the Indo-European religion, it was the custom, beside special invocations to the several gods, to address one to all the gods, for fear of the resentment of those who might have been forgotten or ignored; thus the Greeks never failed to invoke all gods and goddesses (&#0952;&#0949;&#0959;&#8150;&#0962; &#0960;&#8118;&#0963;&#0953; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#0960;&#0940;&#0963;&#0945;&#0953;&#0962;); in the same way the Indian invoked visv&ecirc; dev&acirc;s, 'all the gods,' which, in course of time, gave rise to a special class of gods. Hence, in Mazdeism, arose a class of fiends, the v&icirc;sp&ecirc; da&ecirc;va; but tradition lost the meaning of the word, and the v&icirc;sp&ocirc; da&ecirc;va became 'one who is entirely a Da&ecirc;va by his wickedness' (Comm.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_706"></A><A HREF="sbe0414.htm#fr_712">102:2</A> Demons are often the restless souls of the wicked, excluded from heaven. The Persian sect of the Mah&acirc;b&acirc;dians believed that the soul that had not spoken and done good became an Ahriman or <I>g</I>in (Dabist&acirc;n).</P>
