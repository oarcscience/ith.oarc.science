<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Thrita was the first who drove back death and disease, as Ahura Mazda had brought to him down from heaven ten thousand healing plants that had been growing up around the tree of eternal life, the white H&ocirc;m or Gaokerena.</p>  
<p>This Thrita is mentioned only once again in the Avesta, in Yasna IX, 7, where he appears to have been one of the first priests of Haoma. This accounts for his medical skill; as Haoma is a source of life and health, his first priests must have been the first healers.</p>  
<p>Thrita was originally the same as Thra&ecirc;taona&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1130"></A><A HREF="#fn_1118"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. On one hand, we see that in the Rig-veda the great feat of Thra&ecirc;taona is ascribed to Trita as well as to Trait&acirc;na, and Trita &Acirc;ptya, 'the son of the waters,' was as well the celestial priest who pours Haoma into rain as the celestial hero who kills the snake in storms. On the other hand, we see that Thra&ecirc;taona fulfilled the same functions as Thrita: according to Hamza he was the inventor of medicine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1131"></A><A HREF="#fn_1119"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; the Tavids&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1132"></A><A HREF="#fn_1120"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> against sickness are inscribed with his name, and we find in the Avesta itself the Fravashi of Thra&ecirc;taona invoked 'against itch, hot fever, humours, cold fever&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1133"></A><A HREF="#fn_1121"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, v&acirc;vareshi, against the plagues created by the serpent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1134"></A><A HREF="#fn_1122"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.' We see from this passage that disease was understood as coming from the serpent; in other words, that it was considered a sort of poisoning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1135"></A><A HREF="#fn_1123"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and this is the reason why the</FONT></p>

Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;Thrita it was who first of the healthful, the wise, the happy, the wealthy, the glorious, the strong man of yore, drove back sickness to sickness, drove back death to death, and first turned away the point of the poniard and the fire of fever from the bodies of mortals.</p>
