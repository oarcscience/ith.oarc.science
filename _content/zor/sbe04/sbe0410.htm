<p>Clauses 44-45 refer to contracts, and ought to be placed after &sect; 16. Clauses 47-49, which are in praise of physical weal, have been probably misplaced here from the preceding Fargard (see Farg. III, 33). The right order of this chapter would, therefore, seem to be as follows: 1-16; 44-45 17-43; 46; 49 (bis)-55.</FONT></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_474"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_477">34:1</A> 'He is a thief when he takes with a view not to restore; he is a robber when, being asked to restore, he answers, I will not' (Comm.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_475"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_478">34:2</A> Every moment that he holds it unlawfully, he steals it anew. 'The basest thing with Persians is to lie; the next to it is to be in debt, for this reason among many others, that he who is so, must needs sink to lying at last' (Herod. I, 183). The debtor in question is of course the debtor of bad faith, 'he who says to a man, Give me this, I will restore it to thee at the proper time, and he says to himself, I will not restore it' (Comm.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_476"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_479">34:3</A> The following classification is in fact twofold, the contracts being defined in the first two clauses by their mode of being entered into, and in the last four by their amount. Yet it appears from the following clauses that even the word-contract and the hand-contract became at last, or were misunderstood as, indicative of a certain amount. The commentators, however, were unable to determine that amount, or, at least, they do not state how much it was, which they do with regard to the last four.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_477"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_480">34:4</A> The contract entered into by simple word of mouth. 'The immortal Zartu<I>s</I>t Isfitam&acirc;n asked of the good, beneficent Hormazd, "Which is the worst of the sins that men commit?" The good, beneficent Hormazd answered, "There is no sin worse than when a man, having given his word to another, there being no witness but myself, Hormazd, one of them breaks his word and says, I don't know anything about it . . . there is no sin worse than this?"' (Gr. Rav. 94).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_478"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_481">35:1</A> 'When they strike hand in hand and make then agreement by word' (Gr. Rav. 1. 1.) It would be of interest to know whether word and hand are to be taken in the strict meaning or if they allude to certain formulas and gestures like those in the Roman stipulatio.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_479"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_482">35:2</A> 'Viz. to the amount of 3 ist&icirc;rs in weight,' (Comm.) An ist&icirc;r (&#0963;&#0964;&#0945;&#0964;&#0942;&#0961;) is as much as 4 dirhems (&#0948;&#0961;&#0945;&#0967;&#0956;&#0942;). On the value of the dirhem, see Introd. V, 22.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_480"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_483">35:3</A> 'To the amount of 12 ist&icirc;rs (=48 dirhems),' (Comm.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_481"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_484">35:4</A> 'To the amount of 500 ist&icirc;rs (= 2000 dirhems).' The exact translation would be rather, 'The contract to the amount of a human being,' as the term is applied to promises of marriage and to the contract between teacher and pupil.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_482"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_485">35:5</A> 'Upwards of 500 ist&icirc;rs.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_483"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_486">35:6</A> A sort of gloss added to define more accurately the value of the object and to indicate that it is greater than that of the preceding one.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_484"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_487">35:7</A> If he fail to fulfil it.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_487"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_490">36:1</A> Literally, how much is involved? The joint responsibility of the family was a principle in the Persian law, as it was in the old German law, which agrees with the statement in Am. Marcellinus: 'Leges apud eos impendio formidatae, et abominandae aliae, per quas ob noxam unius omnis propinquitas perit' (XXIII, 6).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_488"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_491">36:2</A> The next of kin to the ninth degree.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_489"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_492">36:3</A> See &sect; 11. This passage seems to have puzzled tradition. The Commentary says, 'How long, how many years, has one to fear for the breach of a word-contract?--the Nab&acirc;nazdi<I>s</I>tas have to fear for three hundred years;' but it does not explain farther the nature of that fear; it only tries to reduce the circle of that liability to narrower limits: 'only the son born after the breach is liable for it; the righteous are not liable for it; when the father dies, the son, if righteous, has nothing to fear from it.' And finally, the Ravaets leave the kinsmen wholly aside; the penalty falling entirely upon the real offender, and the number denoting only the duration of his punishment in hell: 'He who breaks a word-contract, his soul shall abide for three hundred years in hell' (Gr. Rav. 94).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_490"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_493">36:4</A> See &sect; 12. 'His soul shall abide for six hundred years in hell' (Gr. Rav. l. l.)</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_501"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_505">39:2</A> In this paragraph are defined the first three of the eight outrages with which the rest of the Fargard deals. Only these three are defined, because they are designated by technical terms. We subjoin the definitions of them found in a Sanskrit translation of a Patet (Paris, Bibl. Nat. f. B. 5, 154), in which their etymological meanings are better preserved than in the Zend definition itself:--</p>  
<p>&Acirc;gerepta, 'seizing,' is when a man seizes a weapon with a view to smite another.</p>  
<p>Avaoiri<I>s</I>ta, 'brandishing,' is when a man brandishes a weapon with a view to smite another.</p>  
<p>Aredu<I>s</I> is when a man actually smites another with a weapon, but without wounding him, or inflicts a wound which is healed within three days.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_502"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_506">39:3</A> Viz. on the sixth commission of it, as appears from &sect; 28.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_503"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_507">39:4</A> He shall receive two hundred stripes, or shall pay 1200 dirhems (see Introd. V, 19).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_504"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_508">40:1</A> Even though the &Acirc;gerepta has been committed for the first time.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_505"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_509">40:2</A> If he does not offer himself to bear the penalty, and does not perform the Patet (see Introd. V, 22).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_507"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_511">45:2</A> The goods-contract is a general expression for the sheep, ox, and field-contracts (see above, &sect; 2).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_508"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_512">45:3</A> Woman is an object of contract, like cattle or fields; she is disposed of by contracts of the fifth sort, being more valuable than cattle and less so than fields. She is sold by her father or her guardian, often from the cradle. 'Instances are not wanting of the betrothal of a boy of three years of age to a girl of two' (see Dosabhoy Framjee's work on The Parsees, p. 77; cf. 'A Bill to Define and Amend the Law relating to Succession, Inheritance, Marriage, &amp;c.,' Bombay, 1864).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_509"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_513">45:4</A> The contract between pupil and teacher falls into the same class (the man-contract, see <A HREF="#page_35">p. 35</A>, n. <A HREF="#fn_481">4</A>).</P>

The water and the blazing fire are the water and the fire before which the oath is taken (see &sect; 54 n.); putting aside &sect;&sect; 47-49, which are misplaced from Farg. III, 34, one comes to &sect; 50, in which the penalty for a false oath is described.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_512"></A><A HREF="sbe0410.htm#fr_516">46:1</A> 'In Persia there are prizes given by the king to those who have most children' (Herod. I, 136). 'He who has no child, the bridge (of paradise) shall be barred to him. The first question the angels there will ask him is, whether he has left in this world a substitute for himself; if he answers, No, they will pass by and he will stay at the head of the bridge, full of grief and sorrow' (Saddar 18; Hyde 19). The primitive meaning of this belief is explained by Brahmanical doctrine; the man without a son falls into hell, because there is nobody to pay him the family worship.</P>
