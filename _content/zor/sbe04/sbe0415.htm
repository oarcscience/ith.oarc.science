<p>The ceremony described in this Fargard is known among the Parsis as Barashn&ucirc;m n&ucirc; shaba, or 'nine nights&#8217; Barashn&ucirc;m,' because it lasts for nine nights (see &sect; 35)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_751"></A><A HREF="#fn_743"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. It is the great purification, the most efficacious of all; it not only makes the defiled man clean, but it opens to him the heavens (see Farg. XIX, 33; cf. Introd. V, 16). So, although it was formerly intended only for the man defiled by the dead, it became, during the Parsi period, a pious work which might be performed without any corpse having been touched; nay, its performance was prescribed, once at least, at the time of the N&ucirc; z&ucirc;d&icirc; (at the age of fifteen, when the young Parsi becomes a member of the community), in order to wash away the natural uncleanness that has been contracted in the maternal womb (Saddar 36, Hyde 40)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_752"></A><A HREF="#fn_744"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</FONT></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">I a.</h3>

<p>47 (172). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man who does not know the rites of cleansing according to the law of Mazda, offers to cleanse the unclean, what shall the worshippers of Mazda do? How shall I then fight against that Dru<I>g</I> who from the dead rushes upon the living? How shall I fight against that Dru<I>g</I> who from the dead defiles the living?'</p>  
<p>48 (175). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Then, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! the Dru<I>g</I> Nasu waxes stronger than she was before. Stronger then are sickness and death and the working of the fiend than they were before.'</p>  
<p>49 (177). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What is the penalty that he shall pay?</p>  
<p>Ahura Mazda answered: 'The worshippers of Mazda shall bind him; they shall bind his hands first; then they shall strip him of his clothes, they shall flay him alive, they shall cut off his head, and they shall give over his corpse unto the greediest of the birds of the beneficent spirit, unto the corpse-eating birds, unto the ravens, with these words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_780"></A><A HREF="#fn_771"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:--</p>

<p>51 (18 7). Who is he, O Ahura Mazda! who threatens to take away fulness and increase from the world, and to bring in sickness and death?</p>  
<p>52 (188). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;It is the ungodly Ashemaogha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_773"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! who in this material world cleanses the unclean without knowing the rites of cleansing according to the law of Mazda.</p>  
<p>53 (190).

<p>54 (191). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! When are sweetness and fatness to come back again to that land and to those fields, with health and healing, with fulness and increase and growth, and a growing of corn and grass?</p>  
<p>55, 56 (192, 193). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;Sweetness and fatness will never come back again to that land and to those fields, with health and healing, with fulness and increase and growth, and a growing of corn and grass, until that ungodly Ashemaogha has been put to death, and the holy Sraosha has been in that place, offered up a sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_775"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, for three</p>

The furrow, or kesh, plays a greater part in the Mazdean liturgy than in any other. By means of the furrow, drawn with proper spells, and according to the laws of spiritual war, man either besieges the fiend or intrenches himself against him (cf. Farg. XVII, 5). In the present case the Dru<I>g</I>, being shut up inside the kesh and thus excluded from the world outside, and being driven back, step by step, by the strength of the holy water and spells, finds at last no place of refuge but hell, and the world is freed from her presence.</P>
