<p><FONT SIZE="-1">second parts, but there is none as to matter; no clause in the former has its counterpart in the latter. There is more resemblance between the second part and the third; as the first three clauses of the third part (&sect;&sect; 12, 13, 22) relate to the same things as the second, third, and fourth clauses of the second part (&sect;&sect; 8, 9, 10).</p>  
<p>Parts I and II are nothing more than dry enumerations. Part III is more interesting, as it contains two long digressions, the one (&sect;&sect; 14-21) on funeral laws, the other (&sect;&sect; 24-33) on the holiness of husbandry. The fourth part of the chapter may he considered as a digression relating to the first clause of the third part (&sect; 12).</p>  
<p>The things which rejoice or grieve the Earth are those that produce fertility and life or sterility and death, either in it or on it.</p>  
<p>The subject of this chapter has become a commonplace topic with the Parsis, who have treated it more or less antithetically in the Mainy&ocirc;-i-khard (chaps. V and VI) and in the Ravaets (Gr. Rav. pp. 434-437).</p>  
<p>The second digression (&sect;&sect; 24-33) is translated in Haug's Essays, p. 235 seq.</FONT></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">I.</h3>

They were formerly twigs of the pomegranate, date, or tamarind tree, or of any tree that had no thorns, and were plucked with particular ceremonies, which alone made them fit to be used for liturgic purposes (cf. Farg. XIX, 18 seq.) The Parsis in India found it convenient to replace them by brass wires, which, when once consecrated, can be used for an indefinite period.

<P><A NAME="fn_435"></A><A HREF="sbe0409.htm#fr_438">24:1</A> The neck of Arez&ucirc;ra (Arez&ucirc;rah&ecirc; gr&icirc;va) is 'a mount at the gate of hell, whence the demons rush forth' (Bund. 22, 16); it is also called 'the head of Arez&ucirc;ra' (Farg. XIX, 45), or, 'the back of Arez&ucirc;ra' (Bund. 21,17). Arez&ucirc;ra was first the name of a fiend who was killed by Gay&ocirc;mar<I>d</I> (Mainy&ocirc;-i-khard XXVII, 15); and mount Arez&ucirc;ra was most likely the mountain to which he was bound, as A<I>z</I>i Dah&acirc;ka was to Dem&acirc;vend (see Introd. IV, 18).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_438"></A><A HREF="sbe0409.htm#fr_441">24:4</A> With regard to Dakhmas, see Introd. V, 10. 'Nor is the Earth happy at that place whereon stands a Dakhma with corpses upon it; for that patch of ground will never be clean again fill the day of <A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A> resurrection' (Gr. Rav. 435, 437). Although the erection of Dakhmas is enjoined by the law, yet the Dakhma in itself is as unclean as any spot on the earth can be, since it is always in contact with the dead (cf. Farg. VII, 55). The impurity which would otherwise be scattered over the whole world, is thus brought together to one and the same spot. Yet even that spot, in spite of the Ravaet, is not to lie defiled for ever, as every fifty years the Dakhmas ought to be pulled down, so that their sites may be restored to their natural purity (V. i. Farg. VII, 49 seq. and this Farg. &sect; 13).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_441"></A><A HREF="sbe0409.htm#fr_444">25:3</A> There is no counterpart given to the first grief (&sect; 7), because, as the Commentary naively expresses it, 'it is not possible so to dig out hell, which will be done at the end of the world' (Bund. XXXI, sub fin.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_442"></A><A HREF="sbe0409.htm#fr_445">26:1</A> No ceremony in general can be performed by one man alone. Two Mobeds are wanted to perform the Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d service, two priests for the Barashn&ucirc;m, two persons for the Sag-d&icirc;d (Anquetil, II, 584 n.) It is never good that the faithful should be alone, as the fiend is always lurking about, ready to take advantage of any moment of inattention. If the faithful be alone, there is no one to make up for any negligence and to prevent mischief arising from it. Never is the danger greater than in the present case, when the fiend is close at hand, and in direct contact with the faithful.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_450"></A><A HREF="sbe0409.htm#fr_453">28:2</A> It seems as if the law had formerly directed that he should be immediately put to death; but that afterwards, when the rigour of the law had abated, the object which had previously been fulfilled by his death, was then attained by his confinement. He was allowed to live in confinement till he was old and all but dead, and he was put to death by the law, just before he would have died in the usual course of nature (see &sect;&sect; 19, 20). Certain Ravaets put the 'carrier alone' among the number of the margarz&acirc;n (East India Office Library, Zend MSS. VIII, 144); he is not only to be punished in this world, but in the other too; he is condemned to feed in hell on corpses of men (Ar<I>d</I>&acirc; V&icirc;r&acirc;f XXXVIII).</P>
