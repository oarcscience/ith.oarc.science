<p><FONT SIZE="-1">This chapter and the following ones, to the end of the twelfth, deal chiefly with uncleanness arising from the dead, and with the means of removing it from men and things.</p>  
<p>The subjects treated in this Fargard are as follows:--</p>  
<p>I (1-7). If a man defile the fire or the earth involuntarily, or unconsciously, it is no sin.</p>  
<p>II (8-9). Water and fire do not kill.</p>  
<p>III (10-14). Disposal of the dead during winter.</p>  
<p>IV (15-20). How the Dakhmas are cleansed by water from the heavens.</p>  
<p>V (21-26). On the excellence of purity and of the law that shows how to recover it, when lost.</p>  
<p>VI (27-38). On the defiling power of the Nasu being greater or less, according to the greater or less dignity of the being that dies.</p>  
<p>VII (39-44). On the management of sacrificial implements defiled by the dead.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A></p>

<p>1. There dies a man in the depths of the vale: a bird takes flight from the top of the mountain down into the depths of the vale, and it eats up the corpse of the dead man there: then, up it flies from the depths of the vale to the top of the mountain: it flies to some one of the trees there, of the hard-wooded or the soft-wooded, and upon that tree it vomits, it deposits dung, it drops pieces from the corpse.</p>  
<p>2 (7). Now, lo! here is a man coming up from the depths of the vale to the top of the mountain; he comes to the tree whereon the bird is sitting; from that tree he wants to take wood for the fire. He fells the tree, he hews the tree, he splits it into logs, and then he lights it in the fire, the son of Ahura Mazda. What is the penalty that he shall pay&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_529"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?</p>  
<p>3 (11). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;There is no sin upon a man for any dead matter that has been brought by dogs, by birds, by wolves, by winds, or by flies.</p>  
<p>4 (12).

<p>5 (15). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Here is a man watering a corn field.

<p>6 (19). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;There is no sin upon a man for any dead matter that has been brought by dogs, by birds, by wolves, by winds, or by flies.</p>  
<p>7 (20). 'For were there sin upon a man for any dead matter that might have been brought by dogs, by birds, by wolves, by winds, or by flies, how soon this material world of mine would have in it only Pesh&ocirc;tanus, shut out from the way of, holiness, whose souls will cry and wail! so numberless are the beings that die upon the face of the earth.'</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">II a.</h3>

<p>Ahura Mazda answered: 'In every house? in every borough&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_545"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, they shall raise three small houses for the dead&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_546"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>11 (37). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How large shall be those houses for the dead?</p>  
<p>Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;Large enough not to strike the skull, or the feet, or the hands of the man, if he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_547"></A><A HREF="#fn_543"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> should stand erect, and hold out his feet, and stretch out his hands: such shall be, according to the law, the houses for the dead.</p>

<p>13 (44). &#8216;And as soon as the birds begin to fly, the plants to grow, the floods to flow, and the wind to dry up the waters from off the earth, then the worshippers of Mazda shall lay down the dead (on the Dakhma) his eyes towards the sun.</p>  
<p>14 (46). 'If the worshippers of Mazda have not, within a year, laid down the dead (on the Dakhma),</p>

<p>15 (49). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Is it true that thou, Ahura Mazda, sendest the waters from the sea Vouru-kasha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_550"></A><A HREF="#fn_546"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> down with the wind and with the clouds?</p>  
<p>16 (51). That thou, Ahura Mazda, makest them flow down to the corpses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_551"></A><A HREF="#fn_547"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>? that thou, Ahura Mazda, makest them flow down to the Dakhmas? that thou, Ahura Mazda, makest them flow down to the unclean remains? that thou, Ahura Mazda, makest them flow down to the bones? and that then thou, Ahura Mazda, makest them flow back unseen? that thou, Ahura Mazda, makest them flow back to the sea P&ucirc;itika&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_548"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>?</p>  
<p>17 (53). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;It is even so</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A></p>  
<p>as thou hast said, O righteous Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! I, Ahura Mazda, send the waters from the sea Vouru-kasha down with the wind and with the clouds.</p>  
<p>18 (55). &#8216;I, Ahura Mazda, make them stream down to the corpses; I, Ahura Mazda, make them stream down to the Dakhmas; I, Ahura Mazda, make them stream down to the unclean remains; I, Ahura Mazda, make them stream down to the bones; then I, Ahura Mazda, make them flow back unseen; I, Ahura Mazda, make them flow back to the sea P&ucirc;itika&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_549"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>19 (56). &#8216;The waters stand there boiling, boiling up in the heart of the sea P&ucirc;itika, and, when cleansed there, they run back again from the sea P&ucirc;itika to the sea Vouru-kasha, towards the well-watered tree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, whereon grow the seeds of my plants of every kind by hundreds, by thousands, by hundreds of thousands.</p>  
<p>20(60). 'Those plants, I, Ahura Mazda, rain down upon the earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, to bring food to the faithful, and fodder to the beneficent cow; to bring food to my people that they may live on it, and fodder to the beneficent cow.'</p>

<p>21 (63). 'This&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_551"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is the best of all things, this is the fairest of all things, even as thou hast said, O righteous Zarathu<I>s</I>tra!'</p>  
<p>With these words the holy Ahura Mazda rejoiced the holy Zarathu<I>s</I>tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_557"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: 'Purity is for man, next to life, the greatest good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_558"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that purity that is procured by the law of Mazda to him who cleanses his own self with good thoughts, words, and deeds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_559"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>22 (68). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! This law, this fiend-destroying law of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, by what greatness, goodness, and fairness is it great, good, and fair above all other utterances?</p>  
<p>23 (69). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;As much above all other floods as is the sea Vouru-kasha, so much above all other utterances in greatness, goodness, and fairness is this law, this fiend-destroying law of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra.</p>

<p>&#8216;As high as the great tree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> stands above the small plants it overshadows, so high above all other</p>

Even the Mobeds, if we may trust Elisaeus, complained that the fire would burn them without regard for their piety, when to adore it they came too near (Vartan's War, p. 211 of the French translation by l&#8217;Abb&eacute; Garabed). The answer was that it is not the fire nor the water that kills, but the demon of Death and Fate. 'Nothing whatever that I created in the world, said Ormazd, does harm to man; it is the bad N&acirc;i (lege V&acirc;i) that kills the man' (Gr. Rav. 124).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_547"></A><A HREF="sbe0411.htm#fr_551">53:2</A> Zoroaster seems to wonder that Ormazd fears so little to infringe his own laws by defiling waters with the dead. In a Ravaet, he asks him bluntly why he forbids, men to take corpses to the water, while he himself sends rain to the Dakhmas (Gr. Rav. 125).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_548"></A><A HREF="sbe0411.htm#fr_552">53:3</A> The sea where waters are purified before going back to their heavenly seat, the sea Vouru-kasha (see &sect; 19). P&ucirc;itika, 'the clean,' is very likely to have been originally a name or epithet of the sea Vouru-kasha. When the mythic geography of Mazdeism was reduced into a system, the epithet took a separate existence, as it gave a ready answer to that question, which, it may be, was raised first by the name itself: 'Where are the waters cleansed which have been defiled her below, and which we see falling again to us pure and clean?'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_549"></A><A HREF="sbe0411.htm#fr_553">54:1</A> In later mythology, the sea Vouru-kasha and the sea P&ucirc;itika were assimilated to the Arabian sea and to the gulf of Oman: the moving to and fro of the waters from heaven to earth and from the earth to heaven was interpreted as the coming and going of the tide (Bund. XIII).</P>

There is a godlike bird, the Sinamru, sitting on that tree; whenever he flies off the tree, there grow out of it a thousand boughs; whenever he alights on it, there break a thousand boughs, the seeds of which are scattered about, and rained down on the earth by Ti<I>s</I>tar (Ti<I>s</I>trya), the rain-god (Yt.

The Ratu is the chief priest, the spiritual head of the community.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_557"></A><A HREF="sbe0411.htm#fr_562">56:2</A> 'To weep for his crime' (Comm.), which may mean, 'to recite to him the Patet, or, to receive at his hand the proper number of stripes.' It is difficult to say exactly what were the functions of the Sraosh&acirc;-varez, which seem to have been twofold. The cock is compared to him, as being 'the one who sets the world in motion,' and wakes men for prayer (Farg. XVIII, 14, text and note), which would make him a sort of Zoroastrian Muezzin; at the same time he is the priest of penance. His name may refer to either of his functions, according as, it is translated, 'the one who causes hearing,' or 'the executor of punishment;' in the first case he would be the priest who pronounces the favete linguis, the <I>s</I>r&acirc;usha<I>t</I>; in the other case he would be the priest who wields the Sraosh&ocirc;-<I>k</I>arana (see Introd.

Rav. 568).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_591"></A><A HREF="sbe0411.htm#fr_596">64:1</A> These are the names of the different priests who were engaged in the sacrifices. The H&acirc;vanan strains the Haoma; the &Acirc;tare-vakhsha kindles the fire; the Frabaretar brings all that is necessary for the sacrifice (Anquetil); the &Acirc;bere<I>d</I> brings the water (Anquetil and Zand-Pahlavi Glossary, 21); the &Acirc;sn&acirc;tar cleanses the vessels. Those are the priests who are entrusted with the preparatory or accessory proceedings; the essential duties are performed by the Zaotar and the Rathwi<I>s</I>kar, the former chanting the hymns and saying the prayers, the latter performing the various operations during the sacrifice. Nowadays there are only two priests, the Zaotar (Z&ucirc;t&icirc;) and the Rathwi<I>s</I>kar (Rasp&icirc;), the latter performing all the accessory services formerly performed by several priests. As to the Sraosh&acirc;-varez, see above, &sect; 25, note 2.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_598"></A><A HREF="sbe0411.htm#fr_603">65:2</A> Cf. Farg. VIII, 23 seq. It appears from those passages that the dead must lie on the mountain naked, or 'clothed only with the light or heaven' (Farg. VI, 51). The modern custom is to clothe them with old clothing (Dadabhai Naoroji, Manners and Customs of the Parsis, p. 15). 'When a man dies and receives the order (to depart), the older the shroud they make for him, the better. It must be old, worn out, but well washed: they must not lay anything new on the dead. For it is said in the Zend Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d, If they put on the dead even so much as a thread from the distaff more than is necessary, every thread shall become in the other world a black snake clinging to the heart of him who made that shroud, and even the dead shall rise against him and seize him by the skirt, and say, That shroud which thou madest for me has become food for worms and vermin' (Saddar 12). The Greeks entertained quite different ideas, and dressed the dead in their gayest attire, as if for a feast. Yet the difference is only in appearance; for, after the fourth day, when the soul is in heaven, then rich garments are offered up to it, which it will wear in its celestial life (Saddar 87, Hyde 64).</P>
