<p><FONT SIZE="-1">This Fargard may be divided into two parts.</p>  
<p>First part (1-20). Ahura Mazda proposes to Yima, the son of V&icirc;vanghat, to receive the law from him and to bring it to men. On his refusal, he bids him keep his creatures and make them prosper. Yima accordingly makes them thrive and increase, keeps death and disease away from them, and three times enlarges the earth, which had become too narrow for its inhabitants.</p>  
<p>Second part (21 to the end). On the approach of a dire winter, which is to destroy every living creature, Yima, being advised by Ahura, builds a Vara to keep there the seeds of every kind of animals and plants, and the blessed live there a most happy life under his rule.</p>  
<p>The tale in the first part refers to Yima as the first man, the first king, and the founder of civilisation (see Introd. IV, 38); the tale in</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">the second part is a combination of the myths of Yima, as the first dead and the king of the dead over whom he rules in a region of bliss, and of old myths about the end of the world. The world, lasting a long year of twelve millenniums, was to end by a dire winter, like the Eddic Fimbul winter, to be followed by an everlasting spring, when men, sent back to earth from the heavens, should enjoy, in an eternal earthly life, the same happiness that they had enjoyed after their death in the realm of Yima. But as in the definitive form which was taken by Mazdean cosmology the world was made to end by fire, its destruction by winter was no longer the last incident of its life, and therefore, the Var of Yima, instead of remaining, as it was originally, the paradise that gives back to earth its inhabitants, came to be nothing more than a sort of Noah's ark (see Introd. IV, 39, and Orm. Ahr. &sect;&sect; 94, 131, 184, 185).</FONT></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">1.</h3>  
<p>1. Zarathu<I>s</I>tra asked Ahura Mazda:</p>  
<p>O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!</p>  
<p>Who was the first mortal, before myself, Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, with whom thou, Ahura Mazda, didst converse&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_401"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, whom thou didst teach the law of Ahura, the law of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra?</p>  
<p>2 (4). Ahura Mazda answered:</p>  
<p>The fair Yima, the great shepherd, O holy Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! he was the first mortal, before thee, Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, with whom I, Ahura Mazda, did converse, whom I taught the law of Ahura, the law of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra.</p>  
<p>3 (7) Unto him, O Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, I, Ahura Mazda, spake, saying: 'Well, fair Yima, son of V&icirc;vanghat, be thou the preacher and the bearer of my law!'</p>  
<p>And the fair Yima, O Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, replied unto me, saying:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'I was not born, I was not taught to be the preacher and the bearer of thy law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_402"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>4 (11). Then I, Ahura Mazda, said thus unto him, O Zarathu<I>s</I>tra:</p>  
<p>'Since thou wantest not to be the preacher and the bearer of my law, then make thou my worlds thrive, make my worlds increase: undertake thou to nourish, to rule, and to watch over my world.'</p>  
<p>5 (14). And the fair Yima replied unto me, O Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, saying:</p>  
<p>'Yes! I will make thy worlds thrive, I will make thy worlds increase. Yes! I will nourish, and rule, and watch over thy world. There shall be, while I am king, neither cold wind nor hot wind, neither disease nor death.'</p>

<p>13. And I warned the fair Yima, saying: 'O fair Yima, son of V&icirc;vanghat, the earth has become full of flocks and herds, of men and dogs and birds and of red blazing fires, and there is no more room for flocks, herds, and men.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_402"></A><A HREF="sbe0408.htm#fr_404">12:1</A> In the Vedas, Yama, as the first man, is the first priest too; he brought worship here below as well as life, and 'first he stretched out the thread of sacrifice.' Yima had once the same right as his Indian brother to the title of a founder of religion: he lost it as, in the course of the development of Mazdeism, Zarathu<I>s</I>tra became the titular law-giver (cf. Introd. IV, 40; Orm. Ahr. &sect; 156).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_403"></A><A HREF="sbe0408.htm#fr_405">12:2</A> The &sect; 6 is composed of unconnected Zend quotations, that are no part of the text and are introduced by the commentator for the purpose of showing that 'although Yima did not teach the law and train pupils, he was nevertheless a faithful and a holy man, and rendered men holy too (?).'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_405"></A><A HREF="sbe0408.htm#fr_407">13:1</A> Thence is derived the following tradition recorded by G. du Chinon: 'Ils en nomment un qui s&#8217;allait tous les jours promener dans le Ciel du Soleil d&#8217;o&ugrave; il aportait la sciance des Astres, aprez les avoir visit&eacute;s de si prez. Ils nomment ce grand personnage Gemachid' (Relations nouvelles du Levant, Lyon, 1671, p. 478). There is no direct connexion, as it seems, between the two acts of Yima, namely, between his going to the heaven of the sun and his enlarging the surface of the earth. The meaning of the first is given, perhaps, by the tale about the dream of Cyrus: 'He saw in a dream the sun at his feet: thrice he tried vainly to seize it with his hands, as the sun was rolling and sliding away. The Magi said to him that the threefold effort to seize the sun presaged to him a reign of thirty years' (Dino ap. Cicero, De Divin. I, 23). Yima goes three times to the sun, to take thence royal power for three times three hundred years. In Aryan mythology, the sun is, as is well known, the symbol and source of royalty: Persian kings in particular are 'the brothers of the sun.'</P>

The attempt was both a success and a failure; Malk&ocirc;<I>s</I> entered the Iranian mythology and became naturalised there, but it was mistaken for a proper noun, and became the name of a demon, who by witchcraft will let loose a furious winter on the earth to destroy it (Saddar 9). What may be called the diluvial version of the myth is thus summed up in the Mainy&ocirc;-i-khard: 'By him (<I>G</I>amsh&icirc;d) the enclosure of Jam-kard was made; when there is that rain of Malakos&atilde;n, as it is declared in the religion, that mankind and the remaining creatures and creations of H&ocirc;rmezd, the lord, will mostly perish; then they will open the gate of that enclosure of Jam-kard, and men and cattle and the remaining creatures and creation of the creator H&ocirc;rmezd will come from that enclosure and arrange the world again' (XXVII, 27 seq.; edited and translated by E.

<p>We give here the description of Ir&acirc;n-v&ecirc;<I>g</I> according to a later source, the Mainy&ocirc;-i-khard (as translated by West): 'H&ocirc;rmezd created <I>E</I>r&atilde;-v&ecirc;<I>z</I> better than the remaining places and districts; and its goodness was this, that men's life is three hundred years; and cattle and sheep, one hundred and fifty years; and their pain and sickness are little, and they do not circulate falsehood, and they make no lamentation and weeping; and the sovereignty of the demon of Avarice, in their body, is little, and in ten men, if they eat one loaf, they are satisfied; and in every forty years, from one woman and one man, one child is born; and their law is goodness, and religion the primeval religion, and when they die, they are righteous (= blessed); and their chief is G&ocirc;patsh&acirc;h, and the ruler and king is Sr&ocirc;sh' (XLIV, 24).</P>

The latter are right, that is to say, are nearer the mythical <A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A> truth, as the inhabitants of the Vara were primitively the departed and therefore immortal.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_428"></A><A HREF="sbe0408.htm#fr_431">21:1</A> 'The bird Karshipta dwells in the heavens: were he living on the earth, he would be the king of birds. He brought the law into the Var of Yima, and recites the Avesta in the language of birds' (Bund. XIX and XXIV). As the bird, because of the swiftness of his flight, was often considered an incarnation of lighting, and as thunder was supposed to be the voice of a god speaking from above, the song of the bird was often thought to be the utterance of a god and a revelation (see Orm. Ahr. &sect; 157).</P>

They play no great part in Mazdean mythology, and are little more than three subdivisions of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra himself, who was 'the first priest, the first warrior, the first husbandman' (Yt. XIII, 88). Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, as a heavenly priest, was, by right, the ratu in Airyana Va&ecirc;<I>g</I>&ocirc;, where he founded the religion by a sacrifice (Bund. XXXIII and Introd. III, 15).</P>
