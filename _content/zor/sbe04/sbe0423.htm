<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Anything that has been separated from the body of man is considered dead matter (Introd. V, 12), and is accordingly supposed to fall into the possession of the demon and to become the abode of death and uncleanness. Therefore, hair and nails, as soon as cut off, are at once the property of Ahriman, and the demon has to be driven away from them by spells, in the same way as he is from the bodies of the dead. They are withdrawn from his power by</FONT></p>

<p>This chapter, which has given full scope to the ironical humour of many, is an invaluable document in the eyes of the mythologist, as he finds in it, if not the origin and explanation, at least the oldest record of world-wide superstitions. Not only in Bombay, but all over the world, people are found who believe that hair and nails are weapons in the hands of the evil one. The Esthonians, on the shores of the Baltic, take the utmost care not to drop the parings of their nails on the ground, lest the devil should pick them up, to make a visor to his cap, which will give him full power to injure men, unless the sign of the cross has been made over them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_972"></A><A HREF="#fn_960"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The Gauchos in the Chilian pampas fear to throw their hair to the winds, but deposit it in holes dug in a wall&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_973"></A><A HREF="#fn_961"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. In Li&eacute;ge good people are advised not to throw away their hair, nor to leave it in the teeth of the comb, lest a witch take hold of it and cast a spell over them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_962"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</FONT></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">I.</h3>  
<p>1. Zarathu<I>s</I>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which is the most deadly deed whereby a man increases most the baleful strength of the Da&ecirc;vas, as he would do by offering them a sacrifice?'</p>  
<p>2 (3). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;It is when a man here below combing his hair or shaving it off, or paring off his nails drops them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in a hole or in a crack&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>3 (6). &#8216;Then for want of the lawful rites being observed, Da&ecirc;vas are produced in the earth; for want of the lawful rites being observed, those Khrafstras are produced in the earth which men call lice, and which eat up the corn in the corn-field and the clothes in the wardrobe.</p>  
<p>4 (10). &#8216;Therefore, O Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! whenever here below thou shalt comb thy hair or shave it off, or pare off thy nails, thou shalt take them away ten paces from the faithful, twenty paces from the fire, thirty paces from the water, fifty paces from the consecrated bundles of baresma.</p>

<p>6 (17). &#8216;Thereupon thou shalt draw three furrows with a knife of metal around the hole, or six furrows or nine, and thou shall chant the Ahuna-Vairya three times, or six, or nine.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">II.</h3>
