<p><FONT SIZE="-1">This chapter is found only in the Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d S&acirc;dah; it is missing in the Zend-Pahlavi Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d. This is owing, as it seems, only to the accidental loss of some folios in the one manuscript from which all the copies as yet known have been derived; and, in fact, even in the most ancient manuscripts the following Fargard is numbered the thirteenth (Westergaard, Zend-Avesta, preface, p. 5).</p>  
<p>The directions in the preceding chapter are general, and do not depend on the relationship of the faithful with the deceased person; but those in this Fargard are of a special character, and apply only to the near relatives of the dead. Their object is to determine how long the time of 'staying' (upaman) should last for different relatives. What is meant by this word is not explained; but, as the word upaman is usually employed to indicate the staying of the unclean in the Arm&ecirc;<I>s</I>t-g&acirc;h, apart from the faithful and from every clean object, it seems to follow that the relatives of a dead person were considered unclean from the mere fact of being related to him, and were, on this account, shut out of the frequented parts of the house. So, besides the general uncleanness arising from actual contact with a corpse, there was another form of uncleanness arising from relationship with the dead. The natural link that connects the members of one and the same family is of such a kind that no one can die without death entering all of them. Whether this is the primitive form of mourning, or only a later form of it, we will not discuss here.</FONT></p>

<p><FONT SIZE="-1">On the other hand, the house is unclean too, at least with regard to the relatives; for the time of 'staying' is followed by a purification of the house, that is not to be confounded with that described in the eighth Fargard, which takes place directly after the death and, as it appears, opens the house again only to those who were not connected with the dead man. Even nowadays, in Persia, the house where a relative has died is unlucky, and is looked upon with even more repugnance than is shown in the Avesta. The son deserts the house where his father has died; he could not live and walk in it, 'the unlucky step,' the bad qad&icirc;m is in it; 'every man's house must die with him;' therefore, he lets it fall into ruin, and builds another house farther off&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_829"></A><A HREF="#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; a custom to which there seems to be some allusion in the Pahlavi Commentary (ad I, 9).</FONT></p>

<p>22&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_836"></A><A HREF="#fn_824"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (65). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;No more than a frog does whose venom is dried up, and that has been dead more than a year. Whilst alive, indeed, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! that wicked, two-legged ruffian, that ungodly Ashemaogha, directly defiles the creatures of the good spirit, and indirectly defiles them.</p>  
<p>23 (70). &#8216;Whilst alive he smites the water; whilst alive he blows out the fire; Whilst alive he carries off the cow; whilst alive he smites the faithful man with a deadly blow, that parts the soul from the body; not so will he do when dead.</p>  
<p>24 (71). 'Whilst alive, indeed, O Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! that wicked, two-legged ruffian, that ungodly Ashemaogha, never ceases depriving the faithful man of his food, of his clothing, of his house, of his bed, of his vessels; not so will he do when dead.'</p>
