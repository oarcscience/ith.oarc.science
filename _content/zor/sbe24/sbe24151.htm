<p>1. The sixty-third subject is this, that it is necessary to practise strict abstinence from adultery on this account, that <I>through</I> every one who beguiles the wife of another, and commits iniquity with her, that woman becomes, in a moment, unlawful as regards <I>her</I> husband. 2. And, after that, every time her husband comes round about her, it is just as though she had gone near to a strange man. 3. The righteous bestowal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1404"></A><A HREF="#fn_1393"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> <I>of herself</I> on her own husband, in this</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A></p>  
<p>situation, is always worse <I>than his going</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1405"></A><A HREF="#fn_1394"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with women of a different religion, on this account, that, if that wife becomes pregnant, it is just as though one of the good religion had fallen <I>away</I> into a different religion, and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1406"></A><A HREF="#fn_1395"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> thereby that man becomes worthy of death.</p>  
<p>4. And it also happens, when that wife becomes pregnant, <I>that</I> she <I>may</I> effect the slaughter of the infant, from fear of a bad reputation. 5. Then, <I>for</I> that person whose child it is, it is just as though he had effected the slaughter of the child with his own hand; therefore, he is worthy of death. 6. If the infant be born, and it remains&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1407"></A><A HREF="#fn_1396"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the religion, every sin that that child of his commits is, for that person, just as though it were committed by his own hand.</p>  
<p>7. And if a woman of those of the good religion commits <I>adultery</I>, she becomes in a condition unlawful as regards <I>her</I> husband; <I>and</I> if an infant be born it is illegitimate. 8. And the sin owing to this will depart <I>at</I> the time when that person goes near to her husband <I>and</I> shall say: 'What is <I>there</I> in me befitting thy wife? 9. A calamity (&acirc;k) <I>has</I> occurred, and a crime (&#145;<I>h</I>a<I>t</I>&acirc;) <I>has</I> come into <I>my</I> body; thou knowest if thou <I>wilt</I> exercise forgiveness (&#146;haf&ucirc;), and if not, when <I>it is</I> not for me, do thou kill <I>me</I>; my blood is lawful (&#145;hal&acirc;l) unto thee.' 10. If he shall kill her, her sin will depart owing to this;</p>

<p>otherwise, this sin will not depart from her in any manner (nava&icirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1408"></A><A HREF="#fn_1397"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>
