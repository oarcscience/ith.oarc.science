### CHAPTER LI.

1\. The fifty-first subject is this, that it is incumbent on every one
to send a child to school, and to teach *it* something. 2. Because every
duty and good work that a child performs is just as though the father
and mother had performed *it* with their own hands. 3. Therefore it is
necessary to make an effort, so that they *may* teach them something
good, and make *them* aware of good works and sin; for they are doing
that on account of their own souls, so that those *children may* be
courageous in doing good works.

4 <span id="fr_1352"></span>[3](#fn_1341). If they are not taught, they
then perform less duty *and* good works, *and* less reaches the souls of
the father and mother. 5. And it also happens that if they do not
deliver children to school, and do not teach *them* anything, and they
become bold in committing sin, that sin <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[4](#fn_1342) becomes *fixed* on the necks of the
father and mother.

6\. Therefore they have decided rightly who <span
id="fr_1354"></span>[5](#fn_1343) teach

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

them something, especially *what* is proper and improper according to
revelation; because the chief principle is this, whether, through the
duty of this world, a good *or* bad result is coming hereafter.
