<p>1. The fourth subject is this, that it is not desirable for any one that he <I>should</I> become hopeless of the pity (ra&#145;hmat) and forgiveness of H&ocirc;rmazd, and fix <I>his</I> heart outwardly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1102"></A><A HREF="#fn_1094"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> on this, that our sin is excessive <I>and it is</I> not possible to arrive in heaven. 2. Because it happens that a small quantity of duty <I>and</I> good work is performed, <I>and</I> it may be that for that</p>

<p>quantity H&ocirc;rmazd, the good <I>and</I> propitious, <I>may</I> have pity on him <I>and may</I> make <I>him</I> arrive in heaven.</p>  
<p>3. For it is declared in revelation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1103"></A><A HREF="#fn_1095"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, that one time when Zaratu<I>s</I>t was in conversation <I>with</I> the sacred being, the most high, he saw a man whose whole&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1104"></A><A HREF="#fn_1096"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> body was in hell, and one foot&#151;the right <I>one</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1105"></A><A HREF="#fn_1097"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>&#151;was outside of hell. 4. Zaratu<I>s</I>t enquired of the sacred being, the most high&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1106"></A><A HREF="#fn_1098"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, thus: 'What person has this man been?' 5. H&ocirc;rmazd, the good <I>and</I> propitious, gave a reply (<I>g</I>av&acirc;b) thus: 'He has been a king, and possessed the sovereignty of thirty-three towns, and was conducting that sovereignty many years. 6. And he never did any virtuous action, but was committing much oppression, lawlessness, and violence (<I>th</I>ul&#7745;) . 7. By chance (qa&#659;&#803;&acirc;r&acirc;) he was one day going on the chase, <I>and</I> arrived out at a place (ma&ucirc;&#659;&#803;a&#146;h) <I>and</I> saw a goat <I>that</I> was tied. 8. A morsel of hay <I>was</I> placed very far <I>off</I>, and that goat was hungry. 9. Owing to this the goat was trying to eat the hay, but did not reach the hay. 10. This the king saw, <I>and</I> kicked <I>his</I> foot at that hay <I>and</I> cast <I>it</I> in front of the goat. 11. Now, in recompense for that, that one foot of his is outside of hell, and the remaining (b&acirc;q&icirc;) limbs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1107"></A><A HREF="#fn_1099"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> are in hell.'</p>  
<p>12. Therefore, although a sin has happened to any one, it is not necessary <I>for him</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1108"></A><A HREF="#fn_1100"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> to become hopeless. 13. And whoever has the power (<I>t</I>&acirc;qat)</p>

<p>is to endeavour to perform good works, so that <I>there</I> may be an atonement for the sin thereby; because the sacred being, the good <I>and</I> propitious, is kind to every one.</p>
