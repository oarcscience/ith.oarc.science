### OBSERVATIONS.

1\. The division into dars, 'chapters or subjects,' is indicated in the
original manuscripts; but for that of the sections the translator is
responsible, as the subdivisions of the alternating Persian-Gu*g*arâti
text are often at variance with its meaning.

2-6. (The same as on page [2](sbe24006.htm#page_2).)

7\. All Arabic words are quoted in parentheses on their first occurrence
in the text. And the spelling of names approximates more closely to
modern Persian than to the older Pahlavi.

8\. The manuscripts mentioned are:—

B29 (written A.D. 1679) in a Persian Rivâyat, No. 29 in the University
Library at Bombay.

J15 (undated) Persian, No. 15 in the library of Dastûr Jâmâspji
Minochiharji at Bombay. It has been only occasionally consulted for this
translation.

La (dated A.D. 1575) Persian, in Avesta writing, alternating with
Gu*g*arâti, No. 3043 of the Persian manuscripts in the India Office
Library at London; upon the text of which this translation is based.

Lp (undated) Persian, No. 2506 of the Persian manuscripts in the same
library.
