<p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'What is the colder and what is the warmer? 3. What is the brighter and what is the darker? 4. What is the fuller and what is the emptier&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_423"></A><A HREF="#fn_418"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>? 5. What end is the more fruitless&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_424"></A><A HREF="#fn_419"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>? 6. What is that thing of which no superfluity arises <I>for</I> any one? 7. What is that which no one is able to deprive <I>one of?</I> 8. What is that thing which it is not possible to buy at a price? 9. What is that thing with which every one is always&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_425"></A><A HREF="#fn_420"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> satisfied? 10. What is that with which no one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_426"></A><A HREF="#fn_421"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> whatever is satisfied? 11. What is that one wish that A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, the lord, <I>contemplates</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_422"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> as regards men? 12. What is that one wish that Aharman, the wicked, contemplates as regards men? 13. What is the end of the worldly <I>existence</I> and what is the end of&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_423"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> the spiritual <I>one</I>?'</p>

<p>of the wicked the colder. 16. Righteousness is the brighter, and wickedness the darker. 17. The hope <I>and</I> protection which <I>pertain</I> to the sacred beings]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_424"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are the fuller, and those which pertain to the demons are the emptier&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 18. The end of the world-arranging <I>and</I> spirit-destroying man is the more fruitless. 19. It is knowledge of which no one knows a superfluity. 20. It is learning and skill which no one is able to deprive <I>one of</I>. 21. It is understanding and intellect which it is not possible to buy at a price. 22. It is wisdom with which every one and one's own self are untroubled and satisfied. 23. It is stupidity and ignorance with which every one and even one's own self are troubled and not satisfied.</p>  
<p>24. 'That one wish which A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, the lord, contemplates as regards men is this, (25) that "ye shall fully understand me; for every <I>one</I> who fully understands me, comes after me and strives for my satisfaction." 26. And that one wish which Aharman contemplates as regards men is this, (27) that "ye shall not understand me;" for he knows that whoever fully understands that wicked <I>one</I>, does not go after his evil deeds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, (28) and nothing whatever of power and help for him arises&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_427"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> from that man.</p>  
<p>29. 'And <I>as to</I> that which is asked by thee concerning the spiritual and worldly <I>existences</I>, the worldly <I>existence</I> is, in the end, death and disappearance, (30) and of the spiritual <I>existence</I>, in the end,</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_428"></A><A HREF="sbe24046.htm#fr_433">81:1</A> The guardian spirits are the spiritual representatives of each individual being and thing of the good creation, which are supposed to have been all created by A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> in the beginning (see Chap. XLIX, 23, Bd. I, 8).</P>

Time which lasts for ever must end at the resurrection, as in this case (see Chap. II, 193), because time then ceases to exist. But eternity which lasts for ever can never end. If this phrase had the same meaning here as in &sect; 30, it would contradict all the other statements regarding the fate of the wicked, which are to be found in Pahlavi literature, including those of the author himself.</P>
