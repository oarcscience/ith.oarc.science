<p>1. The sixty-fourth subject is this, that it is necessary to practise great abstinence from committing theft&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1412"></A><A HREF="#fn_1401"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and seizing anything from mankind by force.</p>  
<p>2. For it is declared in revelation that, <I>as to</I> every one who steals one dirham&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1413"></A><A HREF="#fn_1402"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> away from another, when they really know <I>it</I>, it is necessary to take two dirhams away from him; one dirham <I>being</I> that which <I>was</I> carried off, and one dirham as the fine of him who committed the theft. 3. It is also requisite to cut <I>off</I> one ear, and it is necessary to strike ten <I>blows with</I> a stick, and to detain <I>him</I> one period in prison.</p>  
<p>

<p>4. And if he shall steal another&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1414"></A><A HREF="#fn_1403"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> dirham, in the same manner <I>one</I> is to take away two dirhams&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1415"></A><A HREF="#fn_1404"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, to cut <I>off</I> the other ear, to strike twenty <I>blows with</I> a stick, and to detain <I>him</I> two periods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1416"></A><A HREF="#fn_1405"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in prison. 5. And if he shall steal three dirhams and two d&acirc;ngs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1417"></A><A HREF="#fn_1406"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, it is requisite to cut <I>off his</I> right hand. 6. If he shall steal five hundred dirhams&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1418"></A><A HREF="#fn_1407"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, it is requisite to hang <I>him</I>.</p>  
<p>7. <I>On</I> the spot the punishment is this, and among the spirits it brings punishment on the soul itself. 8. And, if the <I>other</I> person does not know <I>it</I>, they take away twice as much good work, among the spirits, from that <I>thief</I>, and give <I>it</I> to the soul of this person. 9. If <I>the thief</I> possesses no good works, they give the compensation from the constantly-beneficial treasury&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1419"></A><A HREF="#fn_1408"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and exhibit the punishment on the soul of that <I>thief</I>.</p>  
<p>10. <I>As to</I> that person who has seized anything</p>

<p>from another by force, among the spirits they seize back four <I>things</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1420"></A><A HREF="#fn_1409"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as compensation for every single one. 11. And if, <I>on</I> the spot <I>where people</I> capture him, he makes <I>it</I> convenient to return four <I>things</I> in compensation <I>for</I> one, when they have fully understood, as they capture that person who is committing highway-robbery, <I>that</I> he makes <I>it</I> convenient&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1421"></A><A HREF="#fn_1410"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, they <I>may</I> kill him at once.</p>

XXVI, 3, XXXI, 24, XXXVII, 22, 24, XXXVIII, 3). The term 'treasurer,' applied to the female personifications of conscience who meet the soul with the stores of its good works and sins. (sec Sg.
