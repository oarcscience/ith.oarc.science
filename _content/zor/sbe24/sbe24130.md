### CHAPTER XLII.

1\. The forty-second subject is this, that it is necessary to practise
strict abstinence *from* that sin *which affects* accusers <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[2](#fn_1308). 2. That would be when any one
slanders (buhtânad) <span id="fr_1320"></span>[3](#fn_1309), or any one
commits a rape on the wife of some one <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[4](#fn_1310), or causes a woman *to occupy* a
separate bed from her own husband.

3\. These are sins *for* which there is no retribution, except when thou
beggest forgiveness of that person whom thy sin has assailed. 4.
Afterwards, they keep back the soul, *at* the *K*inva*d* bridge, till
the time when its antagonist arrives and exacts justice from it; then it
obtains release.

5\. Every time that any one applies a falsehood or a slander to some
person, so that *people* are afterwards

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

telling that falsehood again, and it vexes the heart of that person,
they are bringing punishment ever anew on the soul of that *former* one.
6. The sin does not depart through *the performance of* duties and good
works, so long as he does not make *his* antagonist satisfied.

7\. This is a grave sin, *and* it is requisite to he careful that they
do not commit *it*.
