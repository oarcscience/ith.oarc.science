<p>1. The forty-fifth subject is this, that it is continually necessary that <I>people should</I> keep in remembrance the accomplishment of repentance (ta&ucirc;bat). 2. Every time that a sin leaps from control it is necessary to act so that they go before the priests, high-priests, and <I>spiritual</I> chiefs, and accomplish repentance.</p>  
<p>3. And&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1332"></A><A HREF="#fn_1321"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in accordance with the sin <I>should be</I> the good work, just as though the good work <I>were</I> due to that occasion when they accomplish <I>it</I>. 4. While mankind are living, it becomes every year a further benefit. 5. Sin is also, <I>in</I> like manner, going <I>on</I> to a head every year; and when they accomplish repentance, so that it <I>may</I> not increase further, it is just like a tree that becomes withered, and they extirpate its further growth.</p>  
<p>6. And that repentance is better which they accomplish before high-priests and <I>spiritual</I> chiefs, and when they accomplish the retribution that the high-priest orders every sin that exists departs from them. 7. The repentance <I>that</I> high-priests accomplish they likewise call repentance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1333"></A><A HREF="#fn_1322"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 8. If <I>there</I> be no high-priest it is necessary to go before some persons who are commissioned <I>by</I> high-priests; and if those, also, do not exist, it is necessary to go to a man <I>who is</I> a friend of the soul, <I>and</I> to accomplish the repentance.</p>

<p>9. At the time when <I>one</I> shall depart from the world it is incumbent on sons and daughters and relations, that they give repentance into the mouth of the afflicted <I>one, and that</I> they give the Ashem-voh&ucirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1334"></A><A HREF="#fn_1323"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> into <I>his</I> mouth. 10. For the high-priests have said that, when they have accomplished repentance because they have committed many sins, they do not arrive in hell, <I>but</I> they administer punishment <I>to them</I> at the head of the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> bridge, and afterwards conduct <I>them</I> to their own place.</p>  
<p>11. Repentance is that when they accomplish repentance of the sin which they have committed, and do not commit that sin a second <I>time;</I> if they do commit <I>it</I>, that <I>first sin</I> then comes back&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1335"></A><A HREF="#fn_1324"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>
