### CHAPTER LXXIV.

1\. The seventy-fourth subject is this, that *at* dawn, when they rise
up from sleep, it is first necessary to throw something <span
id="fr_1477"></span>[5](#fn_1466) on the hands, that is the

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

hand-cleansing <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1](#fn_1467). 2. Afterwards,
*they are* to wash the hands quite clean with water, *in* such manner
that *they are* to wash the hands three times from the forearm (sâ’hid)
to the end of the hand; and the face is washed from behind the ears to
below the chin *and* up to the crown of the head; and *one* washes the
feet three times thoroughly, as far as the leg (sâq); then *one* recites
the K*e*m-nâ-mazdâ <span id="fr_1479"></span>[2](#fn_1468).

3\. If it be a place where *there* is no water, and the risk be that
*the time for* the Nyâyi*s* <span id="fr_1480"></span>[3](#fn_1469)
*should* pass by, it is requisite to cleanse <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[4](#fn_1470) the hands three times *with* dust, and
to perform the Nyâyi*s*. 4. Afterwards, when *one* arrives at water, *he
is* to wash the hands and face a second time, and to accomplish the
Nyâyi*s* <span id="fr_1482"></span>[5](#fn_1471).

5\. Before *the time* when *one* throws something on the hands it is not
proper to wash the hands and face, *and* it is a Tanâvar sin; it is also
not possible to work at anything whatever *with* the hands and face not
washed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1466"></span>[337:5](sbe24162.htm#fr_1477) According to the
long-metre Sad Dar this 'something' (as in Chap. L) is Nîrang, the
ritualistic liquid or consecrated bull's urine (see Chap. XXXVI, 7 n).
This chapter is, to some extent, a repetition of Chap. L.

<span id="fn_1467"></span>[338:1](sbe24162.htm#fr_1478) Lp adds 'or some
grass upon which no water has come, or fruit, is also to go into the
nose *and* eyes, *and* make *them* clean' (see Chap. L, 2).

<span id="fn_1468"></span>[338:2](sbe24162.htm#fr_1479) See Chap. XXXV,
2 n.

<span id="fn_1469"></span>[338:3](sbe24162.htm#fr_1480) The salutation
of the sun (see Chap. VI, 2).

<span id="fn_1470"></span>[338:4](sbe24162.htm#fr_1481) B29 inserts 'the
face and.'

<span id="fn_1471"></span>[338:5](sbe24162.htm#fr_1482) B29 omits § 4.
