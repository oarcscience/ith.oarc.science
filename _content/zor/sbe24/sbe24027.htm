<p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'What is the end of the world-arranging <I>and</I> spirit-destroying man? 3. What is the end of him who is a scoffing man? 4-6. What is the end of the idle, the malicious, and the lazy man? 7. What is the end of a false-hearted <I>one</I>, (8) and the end of an arrogant <I>one</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?'</p>  
<p>9. The spirit of wisdom answered (10) thus: 'He who is a world-arranging <I>and</I> spirit-destroying man is as injured, in the punishment of the three <I>nights</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, as a raging fire when water comes upon it.</p>  
<p>11&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 'Of him who is a scoffing man <I>there</I> is no glory in body and soul; (12) <I>and</I> every time when he opens <I>his</I> mouth his wickedness then increases. 13. All the fiends, too, become so lodged in his body, that they leave no goodness whatever for his body; (14) and he makes mockery of the good, and glorification of the vile. 15. Also in the worldly <I>existence</I> his body is infamous, and <I>in</I> the spiritual <I>existence his</I> soul is wicked. 16. And, for effecting <I>his</I> punishment in hell, they deliver him over to</p>

<p>the scoffing fiend; (17) <I>and</I> that fiend inflicts a ridicule and a mockery upon him with every single punishment.</p>  
<p>18. '<I>As to</I> him who is an idle man, yet devoid of wickedness, mostly when&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> death comes on in the worldly <I>existence</I>, he thereupon (a<I>g</I>a<I>s</I>) begets pleasantly for the sake of another.</p>  
<p>19. 'The bridge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> which is for the soul of him who is a malicious man is more difficult than <I>for</I> the other wicked who are in hell. 20. For this reason, because malice proceeds by lineage; (21) <I>and</I> it is possible to manage every sin better than malice, (22) because malice will abide in a lineage. 23. There are <I>instances</I> when it adheres&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> until the renovation <I>of the universe;</I> (24) for <I>it</I> is clearly declared by the pure revelation, (25) that the origin of the estrangement (an&icirc;r&acirc;n&icirc;h) of the Ar&ucirc;mans, <I>and</I> even the T&ucirc;r&acirc;nians, <I>from</I> the Ir&acirc;nians, was owing to that malice which <I>was</I> generated by them through the slaughter of A&icirc;r&icirc;<I>k</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; (26) <I>and it</I> always adheres until the renovation.</p>

<p>27. 'He who is a lazy man is said <I>to be</I> the most unworthy of men. 28. Because <I>it</I> is declared by revelation, (29) that the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> produced no corn for him who is a lazy man; (30) for him who is a lazy man <I>there</I> is then no giving of anything in gifts and charity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; (31) and lodging and entertainment are not to be provided for him. 32. For this reason, because that food which a lazy man eats, he cats through impropriety and injustice; (33) and, on account of his laziness and unjust eating, his body then becomes infamous and the soul wicked.</p>  
<p>34. 'He who is a false-hearted man is as dubious in good <I>things</I> as in bad; (35) <I>he</I> is dubious as to the treasure of the spiritual and worldly <I>existences</I>, and also as to the ceremonial, invocation, <I>and</I> service of the sacred beings. 36. And, on account of these circumstances, the angels <I>and</I> archangels shall accept little of the ceremonial <I>and</I> invocations which he performs, (37) and give unto him little of the gain, too, which he seeks. 38. And in the mouth of the good <I>man he</I> is always infamous, (39) and his soul becomes wicked.</p>  
<p>40. 'The friends of him who is an arrogant man are few, and his enemies many. 41. And even of the gifts which he gives to any one, <I>and</I> the ceremonial, too, which he performs for the sacred beings, they shall accept little, on account of <I>his</I> arrogance, (42) and give little of the gain, too, which he seeks. 43. And in hell they deliver him to the fiend of arrogance, in order to inflict punishment upon <I>his</I> soul; (44) and the fiend of arrogance inflicts punishment of various kinds upon it, <I>and</I> is not pacified.'</p>
