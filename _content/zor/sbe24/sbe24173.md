### CHAPTER LXXXV.

1\. The eighty-fifth subject is this, that, *in* every matter that comes
forward, it is necessary to enquire of the wise and relations, so as to
have their advice, and not to transact any business according to one's
own idea *and* opinion.

2\. For it is declared in revelation, that the sacred being, the good
*and* propitious, spoke to Zaratu*s*t thus: '*As to* every business that
thou wishest to transact, do thou receive wisdom and knowledge at one
place with the wise *who* reply, and cast away *what is* unconsidered,
so that Aharman *may* not reach *it* midway, and injury (‘*h*alal) *may*
not occur to that business.'

3\. *In* like manner the archangel Spendârma*d* <span
id="fr_1530"></span>[1](#fn_1519), *at* the time when *her* gaze passed
on to Minô*k*ihar <span id="fr_1531"></span>[2](#fn_1520), issued to him
this admonition *and* precept (vaʓîyat), *and* said: 'O Minô*k*ihar!
although *there* be deliberation *in* an affair, this may be no reason
for it as regards the spirits <span id="fr_1532"></span>[3](#fn_1521);
although a horse may be good, *there* may be no resource *except* a whip
for it; and although *one* may be a wise man, *there* should be no
retreat on his part from having advice, so that his business *may*
become complete.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1519"></span>[350:1](sbe24173.htm#fr_1530) See Chap.
XXXIII, 2 n.

<span id="fn_1520"></span>[350:2](sbe24173.htm#fr_1531) Pahl.
Mânû*sk*îhar (see Mkh. XXVII, 41 n). It appears from Sls. X, 28, where a
portion of this tale is quoted, that it comes originally from the
*K*î*d*ra*s*t Nask.

<span id="fn_1521"></span>[350:3](sbe24173.htm#fr_1532) B29 has
'although a knife be sharp, *there* may be no resource except a
whetstone for it,' which follows the next clause in Sls. X, 28. In the
original text this change of meaning is produced by a difference in only
four words, and the author of the Sad Dar has probably misunderstood the
Pahlavi original when translating it.
