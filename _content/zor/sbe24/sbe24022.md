### CHAPTER XVI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Of the food which men
eat, and the clothing which men put on, which are the more valuable and
good?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'Of the food which men eat,
the milk of goats is produced good. 5. Because, *as to* men and
quadrupeds, who are born from a mother, until the *time* when food is
eaten by them, their growth *and* nourishment are then from milk, (6)
*and* on milk they can well live. 7. And if men, when they withdraw from
the milk of the mother, make thorough experience of the milk of goats,
(8) then bread is not necessary for use among them. 9. Since it is
declared, (10) that "the food of mankind, who are in Arzah and Savah,
Frada*d*afsh and Vîda*d*afsh, Vôrûbar*s*t and Vôrû*g*ar*s*t <span
id="fr_248"></span>[3](#fn_244), is the milk of goats and cows; (11)
other food they do not eat." 12. *And* he who is a milk-consuming man is
healthier and stronger, and even the procreation of children becomes
more harmless.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

13\. 'Of grains wheat is called great and good, (14) because it is the
chief of grains <span id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_245), (15) *and* even
by the Avesta its name is then specified in the chieftainship of
grains <span id="fr_250"></span>[2](#fn_246).

16\. 'And of fruit the date *and* grape are called great and good. 17.
When bread has not come, it is necessary to consecrate the sacred cake
by means of fruit <span id="fr_251"></span>[3](#fn_247); (18) when the
fruit to consecrate is the date or grape, it is allowable to eat every
fruit; (19) *and* when those have not come, it is necessary to eat that
fruit which is consecrated <span id="fr_252"></span>[4](#fn_248).

20\. 'Regarding wine *it* is evident, that it is possible *for* good
*and* bad temper to come to manifestation through wine <span
id="fr_253"></span>[5](#fn_249). 21. The goodness of a man is manifested
in anger, the wisdom of a man in irregular desire <span
id="fr_254"></span>[6](#fn_250). 22. For *he* whom anger hurries on
(aû*s*tâ*v*ê*d*)

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

is able to recover himself from it <span id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_251)
through goodness, (23) *he* whom lust hurries on is able to recover
himself from it through wisdom, (24) *and he* whom wine hurries on is
able to recover himself from it through temper.

25\. 'It is not requisite for investigation, (26) because he who is a
good-tempered man, when he drinks wine, is such-like as a gold *or*
silver cup which, however much more they burn *it*, becomes purer and
brighter. 27. It also keeps *his* thoughts, words, *and* deeds more
virtuous; (28) and he becomes gentler and pleasanter unto wife and
child, companions and friends <span id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_252),
(29) and is more diligent in every duty and good work.

30\. 'And he who is a bad-tempered man, when he drinks wine, thinks
*and* considers himself more than ordinary. 31. He carries on a quarrel
with companions, displays insolence, makes ridicule and mockery, (32)
*and* acts arrogantly *to* a good person. 33. He distresses his own wife
and child <span id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_253), slave and servant; (34)
and dissipates the joy of the good, (35) carries off peace, *and* brings
in discord.

36\. 'But every one must be cautious as to <span
id="fr_258"></span>[4](#fn_254) the moderate drinking of wine. 17.
Because, from the moderate drinking of wine, thus much benefit happens
to him: (38) since it digests the food, (39) kindles the *vital*
fire <span id="fr_259"></span>[5](#fn_255), (40) increases the
understanding and intellect, semen and blood, (41) removes vexation,
(42) *and* inflames the complexion.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 43. It causes
recollection of things forgotten, (44) *and* goodness takes a place in
the mind. (45) It likewise increases the sight of the eye, the hearing
of the ear, and the speaking of the tongue; (46) *and* work, which it is
necessary to do *and* expedite, becomes more progressive. 47. He *also*
sleeps pleasantly in the sleeping place <span
id="fr_260"></span>[1](#fn_256), *and* rises light. 48. And, on account
of these contingencies, good repute for the body, righteousness for the
soul, and also the approbation of the good <span
id="fr_261"></span>[2](#fn_257) come upon him.

49\. 'And in him who drinks wine more than moderately, thus much defect
becomes manifest, (50) since it diminishes his wisdom, understanding and
intellect, semen and blood; (51) it injures the liver <span
id="fr_262"></span>[3](#fn_258) and accumulates disease, (52) it alters
the complexion, (53) and diminishes the strength and vigour. 54. The
homage *and* glorification of the sacred beings become forgotten. 55.
The sight of the eye, the hearing of the ear, and the speaking of the
tongue become less. 56. He distresses Ho*r*vada*d* and
Ame*r*oda*d* <span id="fr_263"></span>[4](#fn_259) (57) *and* entertains
a desire of lethargy <span id="fr_264"></span>[5](#fn_260). 58. That,
also, which it is necessary for him to say and do, remains undone; (59)
*and* he sleeps in uneasiness, *and* rises uncomfortably. 60. *And*, on
account of these contingencies, himself <span
id="fr_265"></span>[6](#fn_261),

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

wife, and child, friend *and* kindred are distressed *and* unhappy, (61)
and the superintendent of troubles <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_262)
and the enemy are glad. 62. The sacred beings, also, are not pleased
with him; (63) and infamy comes to his body, and even wickedness to
*his* soul.

64\. 'Of the dress which people possess *and* put on <span
id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_263), silk is good for the body, and cotton
for the soul. 65. For this reason, because silk arises from a noxious
creature <span id="fr_268"></span>[3](#fn_264), (66) and the nourishment
of cotton is from water, and *its* growth from earth <span
id="fr_269"></span>[4](#fn_265); and as a treasure of the soul it is
called great and good and more valuable.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_244"></span>[45:3](sbe24022.htm#fr_248) The six outermost
regions of the earth, of which Arzah lies to the west, Savah to the
east, Frada*d*afsh and Vîda*d*afsh to the south, and Vôrûbar*s*t and
Vôrû*g*ar*s*t to the north of the central region (see Bd. V, 8, XI, 3).

<span id="fn_245"></span>[46:1](sbe24022.htm#fr_249) It is called 'the
chief of large-seeded grains' in Bd. XXIV, 19.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[46:2](sbe24022.htm#fr_250) Possibly in the
Pâzag Nask, part of which was 'about the thirty-three first
chieftainships of the existences around, that is, how many of which are
spiritual *and* how many worldly *existences*, and which is the second,
and which the third of the spiritual *and* worldly *existences*;' as
stated in the eighth book of the Dînka*rd*.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[46:3](sbe24022.htm#fr_251) That is, when a
cake cannot be made, fruit can be substituted for it in the ceremony of
consecrating the sacred cakes. The sacred cake, or drôn, is a small,
round, flexible pancake of unleavened wheaten bread, about the size of
the palm of the hand, which, after consecration, is tasted by all those
present at the ceremony (see Sls. III, 32 n).

<span id="fn_248"></span>[46:4](sbe24022.htm#fr_252) Fruit and wine are
usually consecrated and eaten, in the Âfrîngân ceremony, after the
completion of the Drôn ceremony, but sometimes the Âfrîngân is
celebrated alone. Both ceremonies are performed in honour of some angel,
or the guardian spirit of some deceased person (see Haug's Essays, pp.
407-409).

<span id="fn_249"></span>[46:5](sbe24022.htm#fr_253) TD2 has 'through
the nature of wine;' but âs, 'wine,' is written mas.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[46:6](sbe24022.htm#fr_254) TD2 has 'the good
of a man is in anger, and the wisdom of a man in lust exciting
viciousness.'

<span id="fn_251"></span>[47:1](sbe24022.htm#fr_255) Reading a*g*a*s*,
instead of afa*s* (Pâz. va*s*); these two words being written alike in
Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[47:2](sbe24022.htm#fr_256) TD2 has 'he becomes
more friendly, gentler, and pleasanter unto wife and child and
companions.' It also omits § 29.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[47:3](sbe24022.htm#fr_257) TD2 inserts
'hireling.'

<span id="fn_254"></span>[47:4](sbe24022.htm#fr_258) Or 'must become
intelligent through.'

<span id="fn_255"></span>[47:5](sbe24022.htm#fr_259) The animal heat,
called the Vohu-fryãn fire in Bd. XVII, 1.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[48:1](sbe24022.htm#fr_260) Nêr. has 'at
sleeping time,' and the word gâs means either 'time' or 'place,' but
usually the latter. TD2 has ba*s*n gâs, probably for bâli*s*n gâs, 'bed
place.'

<span id="fn_257"></span>[48:2](sbe24022.htm#fr_261) Nêr. inserts the
words 'greatly increase' in the Sanskrit version, but they do not occur
in TD2.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[48:3](sbe24022.htm#fr_262) These four words
occur only in TD2.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[48:4](sbe24022.htm#fr_263) The two archangels
who are supposed to be injured by improper eating and drinking (see
Chap. II, 34 n).

<span id="fn_260"></span>[48:5](sbe24022.htm#fr_264) Bûshâsp (Av.
Bûshyãsta), the fiend of slothful sleep.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[48:6](sbe24022.htm#fr_265) Or it can be
translated 'his own body.'

<span id="fn_262"></span>[49:1](sbe24022.htm#fr_266) Meaning probably
the evil spirit.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[49:2](sbe24022.htm#fr_267) The Sanskrit
version omits the former verb, and TD2 the latter.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[49:3](sbe24022.htm#fr_268) Caterpillars are
creatures of Aharman, because they eat and injure vegetation which is
under the special protection of the archangel Ame*r*oda*d*.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[49:4](sbe24022.htm#fr_269) Water and earth,
being both personified as angels, would impart somewhat of their sacred
character to the cotton arising from them.
