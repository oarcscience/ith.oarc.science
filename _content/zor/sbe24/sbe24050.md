### CHAPTER XLIV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'How are the sky and
earth arranged? 3. How are the flow and arrangement of the water in the
world? 4. Whereon do the clouds rest? 5. Where is the demon of winter
more predominant? 6. And which country is the more undisturbed?'

7\. The spirit of wisdom answered (8) thus: 'The sky and earth and
water, and whatever else is within

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

*them* <span id="fr_447"></span>[1](#fn_442) are egg-like
(khâîyak-dî*s*), just as *it were* <span id="fr_448"></span>[2](#fn_443)
like the *e*gg of a bird. 9. The sky is arranged above the earth <span
id="fr_449"></span>[3](#fn_444), like an egg, by the handiwork of the
creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*; (10) and the semblance of the earth, in the midst
of the sky <span id="fr_450"></span>[4](#fn_445), is just like as *it
were* the yolk amid the egg; \[(11) and the water within the earth and
sky is such as the water within the egg.\] <span
id="fr_451"></span>[5](#fn_446)

12\. 'And the flow of the water of every kind which is in the world is.
from the region of Arzah <span id="fr_452"></span>[6](#fn_447) (13)
there where the sun comes up <span id="fr_453"></span>[7](#fn_448); and
*its* downward surge (nîgun bâli*s*nŏ) <span
id="fr_454"></span>[8](#fn_449) is towards the region of Savah (14)
where <span id="fr_455"></span>[9](#fn_450) the sun goes down; and the

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

surging on (âbâli*s*nŏ) of the water is into the sea Pûtîk <span
id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_451), (15) and from the sea Pûtîk it goes
back to the sea Varkash <span id="fr_457"></span>[2](#fn_452).

16\. 'The abode and seat of the clouds are on Albûr*z* <span
id="fr_458"></span>[3](#fn_453).

17\. 'The demon of winter is more predominant in Aîrân-vê*g*ô <span
id="fr_459"></span>[4](#fn_454). 18. And *it* is declared by
revelation <span id="fr_460"></span>[5](#fn_455), (19) that in
Aîrân-vê*g*ô *there* are "ten months winter and two months summer," (20)
*and* "even those" two months of warm weather "are cold *as to* water,
cold *as to* earth, and cold *as to* plants." 21. And their
adversity <span id="fr_461"></span>[6](#fn_456) is the winter, (22) and
the snakes therein are many, (23) while their other adversity is little.

24\. '*It* is declared that Aûha*r*ma*zd* created Aîrân-vê*g*ô better
than other places and districts <span id="fr_462"></span>[7](#fn_457).

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 25. And its
goodness is this, that the life of the people is three hundred
years <span id="fr_463"></span>[1](#fn_458), (26) and of the oxen and
sheep one hundred and fifty years. 27. Their pain and sickness, also,
are little; (28) they fabricate (drû*g*ênd) <span
id="fr_464"></span>[2](#fn_459) no lies, (29) they make no lamentation
and weeping, (30) and the domination of the demon of greediness (A z) in
their bodies is little. 31. When they eat one loaf among ten men, they
are satisfied. 32. And in every forty years one child is born from one
woman and one man <span id="fr_465"></span>[3](#fn_460). 33. Their law,
also, is goodness, and *their* religion the primitive faith <span
id="fr_466"></span>[4](#fn_461); (34) and when they die they are
righteous <span id="fr_467"></span>[5](#fn_462). 35. Their *spiritual*
chief (ratû), likewise, is Gôpaîtŏ <span
id="fr_468"></span>[6](#fn_463), and *their* lord and king is
Srôsh <span id="fr_469"></span>[7](#fn_464).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_442"></span>[85:1](sbe24050.htm#fr_447) L19 has 'within the
sky.'

<span id="fn_443"></span>[85:2](sbe24050.htm#fr_448) L19 has 'are so
arranged as.' The reading of dî*s*, 'like,' is rather uncertain.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[85:3](sbe24050.htm#fr_449) L19 adds 'and below
the earth.'

<span id="fn_445"></span>[85:4](sbe24050.htm#fr_450) L19 has 'and the
earth within the sky.'

<span id="fn_446"></span>[85:5](sbe24050.htm#fr_451) § 11 is taken from
PB6, but is not found in any other Pâzand or Pârsî MS. consulted, nor in
the Pahlavi text of K43; it is, therefore, probably an interpolation.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[85:6](sbe24050.htm#fr_452) See Chap. XVI, 10
n.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[85:7](sbe24050.htm#fr_453) This clause and the
corresponding one in § 14 seem to be at variance with the statements of
Bd. V, 8, XI, 3, that Arzah is in the west, and Savah in the east;
Nêryôsang has, therefore, transferred the conjunction 'and' to the
beginning of the section in both cases, so as to make the eastern waters
flow towards Savah, and the western waters into the sea. If, however, we
understand 'there' to mean 'in those places,' and not to refer to the
region whose name it follows, we may conclude that the statement here is
to the effect that in the east the water flows from Arzah (the western
region), and in the west towards Savah (the eastern region), which might
be true if we place the east in China or Bengal, and the west in Armenia
or Mesopotamia, but it is more probably meant merely to imply that the
whole of the water flows through the central region of Khvanîras.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[85:8](sbe24050.htm#fr_454) L19 has
anbâri*s*nŏ, 'accumulation,' both here and in § 14.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[85:9](sbe24050.htm#fr_455) L19 has 'there
where;' and we must understand '*in those places* where,' as in § 13.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[86:1](sbe24050.htm#fr_456) Av. Pûitika, which
Bd. XIII, 8-11 appears to identify with the Persian Gulf; but in early
times, if not altogether mythic, it was probably some inlet of the
Caspian or Aral.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[86:2](sbe24050.htm#fr_457) Av. Vouru-kasha; in
Pahlavi it is usually called 'the wide-formed,' and in Bd. XIII, 1, 8-10
it is identified with the ocean; but in early times it was probably a
term for the Caspian and Aral, when not applied to the mythic sea of the
sky.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[86:3](sbe24050.htm#fr_458) Av. hara berezaiti,
'a lofty mountain-range,' which is said, in Chap. LVII, 13 and in the
Bundahi*s*, to surround the world and to be the origin of all mountains
(see Bd. V, 3-5, XII, 1-4). In early times it appears to have been the
name of mountains to the east of the first Irânian settlements, before
it was transferred to the mountain range south of the Caspian (see
Geiger's Ost. Kul. pp. 42-45).

<span id="fn_454"></span>[86:4](sbe24050.htm#fr_459) Av. Airyanem
vaê*g*ô, the first settlement of the Irânians, which Geiger (Ost. Kul.
pp. 30-33) places on the upper waters of the Zaraf*s*ân river, and which
Bd. XXIX, 12 describes, in accordance with late tradition, as 'in the
direction of Âtû*r*-pâtakân (Âdarbî*g*ân).'

<span id="fn_455"></span>[86:5](sbe24050.htm#fr_460) Vend. I, 9, 10.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[86:6](sbe24050.htm#fr_461) Produced by the
evil spirit (see Vend. I, 7, 8).

<span id="fn_457"></span>[86:7](sbe24050.htm#fr_462) This is inferred
from Vend. I, 2-4.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[87:1](sbe24050.htm#fr_463) Compare Chap. LXII,
18.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[87:2](sbe24050.htm#fr_464) L19 has
dre*nz*ine*n*d, 'they cause to repeat.'

<span id="fn_460"></span>[87:3](sbe24050.htm#fr_465) Compare Chap. LXII,
17.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[87:4](sbe24050.htm#fr_466) Av.
paoiryô-*d*kaêsha, a term applied to the true Ma*zd*a-worshipping
religion of all ages, both before and after the time of Zaratû*s*t.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[87:5](sbe24050.htm#fr_467) That is, they go at
once to heaven, as the righteous soul does (see Chap. II, 123-157).

<span id="fn_463"></span>[87:6](sbe24050.htm#fr_468) L19 has Gôpatshâh,
'the king of Gôpat' (as in Chap. LXII, 8, 31), which land is described
in Dd. XC, 4 as 'coterminous with Aîrân-vê*g*ô.' Aghrêra*d* and his son
are called kings of Gôpat in Bd. XXIX, 5, XXXI, 22; and Gôk-patŏ is said
to be 'in the non-Aryan countries,' in the Sû*d*kar Nask (see Dd. XC, 8
n).

<span id="fn_464"></span>[87:7](sbe24050.htm#fr_469) Apparently the
angel Srôsh (see Chap. II, 115).
