<p>1. The fifty-eighth subject is this, that it is ever necessary that those of the good religion <I>should</I> make an effort that they <I>may</I> celebrate <I>a ceremony for their</I> living souls. 2. <I>For</I> the soul, <I>for which</I> they have celebrated <I>a ceremony</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1379"></A><A HREF="#fn_1368"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, just as much good work as it then becomes each year, it is twice as much good work the second year. 3. So that, <I>in</I> this manner, the merit of <I>the ceremony for</I> the living soul is increasing just so much every year, while the man is living. 4. And, after that, this also occurs, that, if at the time when that person becomes an immortal soul <I>there</I> be no one <I>at hand</I>&#151;Sr&ocirc;sh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1380"></A><A HREF="#fn_1369"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> <I>being</I> the angel when <I>the ceremony for</I> the living soul is celebrated&#151;Sr&ocirc;sh, the righteous, receives the soul by</p>

<p>himself, and is keeping watch <I>over it</I> during the three days&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1381"></A><A HREF="#fn_1370"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and does not forsake <I>it</I>, so that no danger <I>or</I> harm happens to it. 5. And the fourth night he is a helper, with the angel Rashn&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1382"></A><A HREF="#fn_1371"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> at the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> bridge, while they make up its account and reckoning, and it goes <I>to</I> its own place.</p>  
<p>6. And this <I>ceremony for</I> the living soul is appointed for the reason that, just in the manner <I>that</I>, when an infant becomes separated from the mother, a midwife (q&acirc;bilat) is necessary for it, so that they <I>may</I> keep watch over it, <I>and</I> just in the manner that she takes up the infant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1383"></A><A HREF="#fn_1372"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> from the ground&#151;and, <I>at</I> the time when it is born, it is ever necessary that <I>there</I> be a woman present (&#145;h&acirc;&#659;&#803;irat), or they <I>may</I> perform work <I>for</I> the infant at a time <I>fit</I> for the demon&#151;<I>in</I> this same manner, when the soul is becoming separated from the body it is like an infant (<I>t</I>ifl), <I>and</I> does not know any way to its place. 7. When they celebrate <I>a ceremony for</I> the living soul, and have propitiated the righteous Sr&ocirc;sh, the righteous Sr&ocirc;sh becomes like the midwife, so that he receives that soul by himself, and keeps watch <I>that it is</I> out of the hands of Aharman and the demons. 8. When they do not celebrate <I>a ceremony</I> for the soul <I>when</I> living, <I>but</I>, after that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1384"></A><A HREF="#fn_1373"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, the priests perform <I>it</I> before Sr&ocirc;sh, it is like that <I>which occurs</I> when a woman brings forth a child&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1385"></A><A HREF="#fn_1374"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> after that they set <I>her</I> before the midwife. 9. And it happens that while some one is coming in, who takes up that child and wraps <I>it</I> up, it has perished.</p>

<p>10. Therefore, as she does the needful which they <I>should</I> do earlier by the hand of some one, <I>in</I> this same manner it makes <I>it</I> incumbent on every one to celebrate <I>a ceremony for</I> his own living soul, so that it <I>may</I> be free (&icirc;man) from these misfortunes. 11. <I>And</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1386"></A><A HREF="#fn_1375"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that, if his decease occurs <I>in</I> any place where <I>there</I> may be no one who <I>will</I> celebrate <I>a ceremony for</I> his soul, since <I>a ceremony for</I> the living soul is celebrated, <I>there</I> are no arrears for him, and he is free. 12. And, in many things, it is that <I>ceremony for the</I> living soul which is expedient, especially in these times when the priests have remained few <I>in</I> number; <I>and</I>, when it is celebrated by one's own hands, it is a great duty.</p>
