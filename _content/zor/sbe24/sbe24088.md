# SAD DAR.

### INTRODUCTION.

1\. *In* the name of Hôrmazd, the lord, the greatest *and* wise <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[1](#fn_1068), the all-ruling, all knowing, *and*
almighty.

2\. This is a book (kitâb), about the proper and improper, which is
extracted from the good *and* pure <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[2](#fn_1069) religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers.
3. What is expedient (vâ*g*ib) is this, for every one to know *and* keep
this in practice. 4. And it is not desirable that he become independent
(‘*h*âlî) of this *for* a single hour (sâ’hat). 5. Because, when *one*
becomes independent, the sin for each one may become abundant; *and*
when *it is* brought into practice the reward becomes abundant.

6\. On this occasion (vaqt) I, a servant of the religion—like the môbad
*E*rân-shâh <span id="fr_1078"></span>[3](#fn_1070), son (bin) of

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yazad-yâr, son of
Tî*s*tar-yâr, son of Âdar-bâ*d*, *son of* Mâraspend <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[1](#fn_1071)—*have* sent a reward to their souls,
unto every one who reads and is bound by duty <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[2](#fn_1072). 7. Thus much (în qadar), which *has*
come written, is a good work they know, whosoever are superior; *but* it
is not possible for every one inferior to know of this. 8. If it were
more (ziyâdat) it is proper, but if (imṃâ) less than this it is not
proper to know <span id="fr_1081"></span>[3](#fn_1073); while, *in*
gratitude *for* the benefits (*s*ukr-i ni’hmat) of the sacred being,
they become increasing in action, and the sacred being, the most high
(ta’hâlâi) <span id="fr_1082"></span>[4](#fn_1074), makes benefits occur
on the spot on that account.

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

9\. And, secondly, the kindness (lu*t*f) and generosity (karm) of the
sacred being, the most high <span id="fr_1083"></span>[1](#fn_1075), are
manifest from this, that he created us with each member (âlat) complete
(tamâm), and did not keep anything from the maternal *nature*. 10. And
whatever was necessary for use he gave us. 11. At the head, likewise, he
appointed a master, which is <span id="fr_1084"></span>[2](#fn_1076) the
wisdom for the purpose that they *may* keep these members in action.

12\. May the peace of the sacred being, the most high, be on the souls
of those acquainted with the religion of the pure Zaratu*s*t, the
Spitamân, and of those *who are* pure *and* virtuous. 13. For the souls
of those persons it is desirable that every duty they perform they
*shall* perform through the authority (dastûrî) of the wisdom of the
high-priests <span id="fr_1085"></span>[3](#fn_1077).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[255:1](sbe24088.htm#fr_1076) It is possible
to translate the original (which is the same as in Sg. I, 1) as
follows:—'The name of Hôrmazd is "the lord, the greatest wise *one*,"'
as though these epithets were the meaning of Hôrmazd, which is not far
from the truth; but this would not be a probable form for an invocation.
Lp and B29 have a different invocation.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[255:2](sbe24088.htm#fr_1077) Lp, B29, J15
omit '*and* pure.'

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[255:3](sbe24088.htm#fr_1078) This is the name
of the writer who composed the Sad Dar Na*th*m, or metrical Sad Dar, in
A.D. 1495. He calls himself, however, a son of Malik-shâh in the
introduction to his verses (see Hyde's Historia Religionis Veterum
Persarum, Oxon, 1700, p. 433); and in his postscript he mentions
Mard-shah as his own name, which Dastûr Jâmâspji understands to mean
Shah-mard, in the introduction to his Gu*g*arâti translation of the Sad
Dar-i Ba‘hr-i *T*avîl, or long-metre Sad Dar (2nd ed., Bombay, 1881).
The date <span id="page_256">p. 256</span> of composition of this
long-metre Sad Dar is A.D. 1531, according to Dastûr Jâmâspji, and its
authors state that they compiled it from the Sad Dar NaTHr, or prose Sad
Dar, which was composed by three celebrated Dastûrs near the time of the
Arab conquest. The names in our text are found here only in La, which is
either the original, or an early copy, of a version of the prose Sad Dar
compiled by Râma, son of Kanhaksha, in which the Persian is written in
Avesta letters, and alternates with an old Gu*g*arâti translation
composed by his son Padama. This version was prepared A.D. 1575, and the
occurrence of the name of Erin-shah, who lived only eighty years
earlier, indicates that this part of the introduction was probably
written by the editor Râma, and not copied from the original prose Sad
Dar. In Lp 'the môbad *E*rân-shâh, son of Yazad-yâr,' is mentioned at
the end of the work.

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[256:1](sbe24088.htm#fr_1079) The last two
names are introduced merely to show that *E*rân-shâh traced his ancestry
back either to the celebrated Âtûr-pâ*d* Mâraspend, prime minister of
Shâpûr II (A.D. 309-379), or to another priest of the same name who
lived about A.D. 900 (see Bd. XXXIII, 11); but very many intermediate
names have been omitted in this genealogy.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[256:2](sbe24088.htm#fr_1080) J15 omits the
whole of § 6, and Lp, B29 have merely 'and a reward is sent to their
souls, &c.,' to be read in connection with § 5.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[256:3](sbe24088.htm#fr_1081) Lp, B29, J15
have 'so that no hesitation arises' instead of 'to know.'

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[256:4](sbe24088.htm#fr_1082) Lp, B29, J15
omit this epithet.

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[257:1](sbe24088.htm#fr_1083) Lp, B29, J15
omit this epithet.

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[257:2](sbe24088.htm#fr_1084) J15 has 'who
possessed.'

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[257:3](sbe24088.htm#fr_1085) For §§ 12, 13
Lp, B29, J15 have merely the following:—'And peace is possible for that
person who does every duty that he performs, through the authority of
the high-priests.'
