<p>1. The first subject (2) is about several questions <I>that</I> the ever-successful Mit<I>r</I>&ocirc;-a&icirc;yy&acirc;r&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_651"></A><A HREF="#fn_643"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, son of Mahm&acirc;<I>d</I>,</p>

<p>from Sp&acirc;h&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_652"></A><A HREF="#fn_644"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, asked with good intent <I>and</I> not in search of defects, <I>and</I> the answer <I>thereto</I>.</p>  
<p>3. <I>As to</I> that which is asked thus: 'Why did Aharman hurry on to the light&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_653"></A><A HREF="#fn_645"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and how was it possible to be <I>so</I> when <I>he</I> is not <I>of</I> a like nature with it, though we always see that whatever is not <I>of</I> a like nature abstains from a different nature as much as water <I>does</I> from fire?' 4. The answer is this, that the cause itself of the hurrying on of Aharman, which <I>was</I> to the light, <I>was his</I> different nature. 5. And on account of the desire of a destroyer, which was perpetually in his nature, <I>he</I> is a destroyer of different natures.</p>  
<p>6. Being injured <I>and</I> injuring, however they occur, do not take place except from difference of nature and those of a different nature. 7. Because <I>in</I> those of a like nature <I>there</I> exist similarity of will and unanimity, one towards the other, not injuring <I>and</I> being injured. 8. And those of a different nature, on account of <I>their</I> opposing nature, are destroyers <I>and</I> injurers, one of the other, however they come together. 9. Those of a like nature, on account of unanimity and similarity of nature, are lively&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_654"></A><A HREF="#fn_646"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, efficient, and mutually helping, when they come together.</p>  
<p>10. The disintegration and separation of like natures is the disunion of different natures. 11. Just</p>

<p>as heat <I>and</I> cold which, on account of <I>their</I> opposing nature, are destroyers and injurers, resisting <I>and</I> disintegrating one another, through <I>their</I> perpetual nature. 12. Because every disintegration is owing to the laws (rastag&acirc;n) of cold and dryness, heat and moisture, (13) and <I>their</I> destruction, injuring, <I>and</I> opposition of one another. 14. For the disintegration of bodies is owing to the perpetual struggling of heat and cold, dryness and moisture; (15) <I>and</I> owing to their struggling, one with the other, bodies are disintegrated <I>and</I> disabled.</p>  
<p>16. Of water and fire, through their own nature, no injury whatever is manifest; (17) but the cold of <I>their</I> fraternization&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_655"></A><A HREF="#fn_647"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is mingled with the moisture of the water, <I>and</I> is an opponent of the heat of the fire; (18) and the dryness of <I>their</I> fraternization is mingled with the heat of the fire, <I>and</I> is counteractingly an injurer of the moisture <I>of</I> the water.</p>

The Parsis under a Muhammadan government often adopted Muhammadan names, as they also took Hindu names in India; but, in this case, it is perhaps more probable that the father had become <A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A> a convert to Muhammadanism, and changed his name accordingly, after his son had grown up.</P>
