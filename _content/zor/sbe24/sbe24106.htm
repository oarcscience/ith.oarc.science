<p>1. The eighteenth subject is this, that it is necessary for mankind to make an endeavour, so that they <I>may</I> espouse a wife in <I>their</I> youth and beget a child. 2. And for women, in like manner, it is necessary that <I>there</I> should be a longing (ra<I>gh</I>bat) for espousing a husband.</p>  
<p>3. Because it is declared in revelation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1194"></A><A HREF="#fn_1185"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>that</I> every duty and good work a child performs becomes the father's and mother's, just like those which they have performed with their own hands. 4. The meaning (ma&#146;hn&icirc;) of p&ucirc;r ('a son') is that which signifies p&ucirc;l ('a bridge')&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1195"></A><A HREF="#fn_1186"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, for by this bridge they arrive at that <I>other</I> world. 5. If <I>there</I> be no child for any one they call <I>him one with</I> a severed bridge, that is, the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>way for him <I>to</I> that <I>other</I> world is severed, and he is not able to attain to that world. 6. At the head of the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> bridge he shall remain; although he has performed much duty and good works he is not able to make a passage over the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> bridge, and they do not make up his account and reckoning. 7. And every archangel that comes forward <I>to</I> that place first asks these words, that is, 'Hast thou brought thy own substitute visibly into the world, or not?' 8. When he has not brought <I>it</I>, they will pass over him, and his soul will remain, <I>in</I> that place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1196"></A><A HREF="#fn_1187"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, full of anguish and grief (<I>gh</I>am).</p>  
<p>9. A similitude (miTH&acirc;l) of it is like that which <I>happens when</I> any one may be in a wilderness, and <I>there</I> may be fear of wild animals and creatures, and near to him may be his own town, <I>but</I> a river of water is in front&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1197"></A><A HREF="#fn_1188"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and it is not possible to make a passage over that river, <I>as</I> a bridge is fallen in, and he is not able to arrive at that town, <I>but</I> he is always upon the bank (sar<I>t</I>) <I>speaking</I> thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1198"></A><A HREF="#fn_1189"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: 'Would that the bridge would become perfect!'</p>  
<p>10. The duty as to children&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1199"></A><A HREF="#fn_1190"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is in this aggregate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1200"></A><A HREF="#fn_1191"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. 11. Therefore, the creator H&ocirc;rmazd <I>has</I> granted unto men that, if <I>there</I> be any one to whom sickness from heaven may occur, and <I>there</I> be no provision of a child for him, he <I>has</I> commanded him that he <I>should</I> make some one a son of his own, as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1201"></A><A HREF="#fn_1192"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> a friend of <I>his</I> soul, and <I>should</I> receive a child, because every duty <I>can be</I> delegated. 12. That person is in place of a</p>

<p>child, and every duty and good work that he performs shall be just like that <I>which</I> is performed by one's own hand.</p>  
<p>13. And, finally, if any one departs from the world (duny&acirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1202"></A><A HREF="#fn_1193"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and possesses no adopted child, it is incumbent on the priests and high-priests and his relations to appoint his adopted son, and it is necessary to bring some one in sight on that account, so that his soul <I>may</I> spring away from the torment of hell. 14. Because, every time that his relations do not pay attention <I>to this</I>, when they proceed to that <I>other</I> world, the soul of that person hangs about them and speaks thus: 'I left with you something that I had collected and borne trouble for in many years, and you seized upon <I>it</I>, and put <I>it</I> into your own expenditure (&#145;<I>h</I>arg), and did not seek for&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1203"></A><A HREF="#fn_1194"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> mercy (<I>s</I>afqat) on my soul. 15. <I>In</I> the same manner as I have remained, delayed (ma&ucirc;q&ucirc;f) <I>in</I> this place, I <I>will</I> not let you pass; so that you <I>will</I> make no passage over the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> bridge till the sacred being takes my rights away from you.' 16. Then the angel Rashn and the angel Mihir&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1204"></A><A HREF="#fn_1195"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> make up their reckoning, <I>and, as to</I> whatever those persons have seized upon from the <I>other's</I> property&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1205"></A><A HREF="#fn_1196"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, for every single d&icirc;n&acirc;r the account makes four, and they take away the equivalent. 17. And, <I>as</I> in that world <I>there</I> are no gold and silver, they take away from their souls the good works that they have done, and they give <I>them</I> to the soul of this <I>other</I>. 18. Still, while <I>others</I> do not appoint the adopted son, they are not able to pass over the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> bridge, nor to arrive at their own station.</p>

<p>19. There is no duty whatever more incumbent on relations than this duty, and every time that they appoint an adopted son <I>for</I> any one it is just as though they have made the deceased alive; and there are no limit (&#145;hadd) and end (nih&acirc;yat) of their good works.</p>
