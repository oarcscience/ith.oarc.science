### CHAPTER XLVIII <span id="fr_1340"></span>[1](#fn_1329).

1\. The forty-eighth subject is this, that, when they boil a
cooking-pot, it is necessary to make the water two parts of one-third
*each*, that one-third of the pot may be empty; so that, if *at* any
time the pot shall boil, *the water* shall not go to the top <span
id="fr_1341"></span>[2](#fn_1330). 2. For if they do not act so, and
the <span id="fr_1342"></span>[3](#fn_1331) water, owing to not
stopping, goes into the fire <span id="fr_1343"></span>[4](#fn_1332), it
is a sin of a thousand and two hundred dirhams *in* weight <span
id="fr_1344"></span>[5](#fn_1333); therefore it is necessary to keep
watch that this sin does not arise.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1329"></span>[311:1](sbe24136.htm#fr_1340) There is some
confusion in the MSS. as to the arrangement of a few of the following
chapters. The order here adopted is that of B29, J15, which is here in
accordance with the metrical MSS., although Chaps. 48-56 are numbered
52-60 in the latter, owing to variations in the earlier part of the
work. In La Chaps. 48-50 have been originally omitted, but part of 48,
prefixed to a portion of 50, has been afterwards inserted in the margin,
and Chap. 49 has been similarly added after the last chapter in the
book. In Lp the chapters are arranged as follows:—48, 51-53, 49, 54, 56,
while 50, 55 are omitted.

<span id="fn_1330"></span>[311:2](sbe24136.htm#fr_1341) Lp, B29, J15 add
'*and* the water not go into the fire.' La, Lp add 'at least one-third
*should be* water \[in such a manner that it becomes wet from ear to
ear. It is necessary to keep the mouth continually closed, so that the
water *shall* not go into the mouth\],' but the passage in brackets is
clearly a portion of Chap. L, 2, 3; it was originally written also in
J15, but has been struck out of that MS.

<span id="fn_1331"></span>[311:3](sbe24136.htm#fr_1342) La has 'if a
drop of.'

<span id="fn_1332"></span>[311:4](sbe24136.htm#fr_1343) La has 'mouth;'
the passage in that MS. being evidently the end of Chap. L, 3.

<span id="fn_1333"></span>[311:5](sbe24136.htm#fr_1344) La has 'of three
hundred stîrs,' as in Chap. L, 3, and omits the rest of the text. The
two amounts are identical, and are equivalent to a Tanâvar or Tanâpûhar
sin (see Sls. I, 2).
