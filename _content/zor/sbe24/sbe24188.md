### CHAPTER C.

1\. The hundredth subject is this, when a person molests or smites any
one *who is* innocent, it is a sin of one Tanâvar every day for that
*person*, as long as he lives <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1](#fn_1574).
2. *And*, when he departs from this world, the angel Mihir and the angel
Rashn make up his account and reckoning. 3. *He is* <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[2](#fn_1575) full of affliction, and experiences
much regret and penitence, and has no advantage from it <span
id="fr_1587"></span>[3](#fn_1576). 4. It is *therefore* necessary to
keep oneself far from this sin <span id="fr_1588"></span>[4](#fn_1577).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1574"></span>[361:1](sbe24188.htm#fr_1585) See Sls. X, 17.

<span id="fn_1575"></span>[361:2](sbe24188.htm#fr_1586) Lp, B29, J15
have 'afterwards, he remains *in* that place.'

<span id="fn_1576"></span>[361:3](sbe24188.htm#fr_1587) B29, J15 add
'*in* that place.'

<span id="fn_1577"></span>[361:4](sbe24188.htm#fr_1588) B29, J15 add
'and to do good to every one.' In La this chapter was originally
numbered XCIX, and Chap. XLIX was subsequently inserted after it, and
numbered C. In Lp it was numbered XCVIII, and occurs again as Chap. C,
while Chap. XCIX is a repetition of XLIX (which is numbered LII in Lp).
The discrepancy in the numbering of the chapters, of one in the case of
La, and two in Lp, extends backwards as far as the confusion mentioned
in [p. 311](sbe24136.htm#page_311), note [1](sbe24136.htm#fn_1329), and
was evidently due to that confusion.
