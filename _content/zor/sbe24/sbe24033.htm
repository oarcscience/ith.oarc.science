<p>1.

Much benefit <I>was</I> also obtained by them from the sacred beings, (4) <I>and</I> they have been mostly those who <I>were</I> ungrateful unto the sacred beings, (5) and there are <I>some</I> even who have been very ungrateful, promise-breaking, <I>and</I> sinful. 6. For what benefit then have they <I>been</I> severally created, (7) and what result and advantage proceeded from them?'</p>  
<p>8. The spirit of wisdom answered (9) thus: 'That which thou askest concerning them, as to benefit, or <I>as to</I> the reverse&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, thou shouldst become aware of and fully understand. 10. Because the affairs of the world of every kind proceed through destiny and time and the supreme decree of the self-existent eternity (z&ocirc;rv&acirc;n), the king and long-continuing lord. 11. Since, at various periods, it happens unto every one, for whom it is allotted, just as that which is necessary to happen. 12.

<P><A NAME="fn_311"></A><A HREF="sbe24033.htm#fr_315">60:4</A> According to a legend preserved in the Persian Riv&acirc;yats (see MH10, fol. 52) Aharman, while kept as a charger by T&acirc;khmorup, induced the wife of the latter to ascertain from her husband whether he ever felt fear while riding the fiend, and, acting upon the information thus obtained, he threw the king from his back while descending from the Albur<I>z</I> mountains, and swallowed him. Information of this event was conveyed to Yim by the angel Sr&ocirc;sh, who advised him to seek the fiend and propitiate him. Yim, accordingly, went into the wilderness singing, to attract Aharman, and, when the fiend appeared, Yim ingratiated himself into his favour and, taking advantage of an unguarded moment, he dragged T&acirc;khmorup out of the fiend's entrails, and placed the corpse in a depository for the dead. In consequence of this feat his hand was attacked with leprosy, from which he suffered greatly until it was accidentally washed in bull's urine, which healed it. This legend is related for the purpose of recommending the use of bull's urine for purification of the body.</P>
