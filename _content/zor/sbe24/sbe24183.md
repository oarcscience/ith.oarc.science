### CHAPTER XCV.

1\. The ninety-fifth subject is this, that it is necessary that it be
expedient for all those of the

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

good religion to perform the salutation of the sun <span
id="fr_1574"></span>[1](#fn_1563) three times every day.

2\. If *one* performs *it* once, it is a good work of one Tanâvar <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[2](#fn_1564); if he performs *it* twice, it is
twice as much; *and* if he performs *it* three times, it is thrice as
much. 3. And if he does not perform one repetition, it is a sin of
thirty stîrs <span id="fr_1576"></span>[3](#fn_1565); if he does not
perform two repetitions, it is twice as much sin; and if he does not
perform three repetitions, it is thrice as much sin.

4\. And it is the same as this with regard to *the salutations of* the
moon and fire <span id="fr_1577"></span>[4](#fn_1566). 5. Therefore it
is expedient, in the religion, for every one of the good religion to
bring the salutations *into* practice.
