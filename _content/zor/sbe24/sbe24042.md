### CHAPTER XXXVI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Which sin is the more
heinous?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'Of the sin which people
commit, unnatural intercourse is the more heinous. 5. The second is *he*
who *has* suffered *or* performed intercourse with men. 6. The third,

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_374"></span>[71:1](sbe24042.htm#fr_379) See Chap. IV, 4 n.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[71:2](sbe24042.htm#fr_380) If a man has not
appointed an adopted son during his lifetime, and leaves property
producing an income of eighty-four rûpîs or more, but no privileged
wife, or child, or domesticated brother, fit for the duty of
guardianship, then an adopted son must be appointed by his nearest
relations after his death (see Dd. LVI-LX).

<span id="fn_376"></span>[71:3](sbe24042.htm#fr_381) The sacred fire,
named after the angel Varahrâm or Vâhrâm (see Chap. II, 115).

<span id="fn_377"></span>[71:4](sbe24042.htm#fr_382) The baprakŏ-î
â*v*îk is the Av. bawri*s* upâpô, with whose skins Ardvîsûra, the angel
of water, is said to be clothed (Âbân Yt. 129). It is said to have been
'created in opposition to the demon which is it the water' (see Bd. XIX,
29). Whether it is the same as the Av. udra upâpa, 'water-otter,' is not
quite certain; but killing the latter was considered (for some reason
not clearly ascertained) a very heinous sin, for which the proper
atonement is fully detailed in Vend. XIV.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[72:1](sbe24042.htm#fr_383) L19 has
'falsehood.'

<span id="fn_379"></span>[72:2](sbe24042.htm#fr_384) The term zandîk,
according to Mas’aûdî (chap. xxiv), was first applied to the Manicheans,
and afterwards to all others who followed the commentary (zand) in
preference to the Avesta; finally, however, the Arabs applied the term
to the Persians, probably with its acquired meaning of 'heretic' or
'infidel.' A different explanation of the term is given in Pahl. Yas.
LX, 11, where it is stated that 'Zand is the apostle of the wizards,
*and* through Zand it is possible to perform witchcraft.' The Sanskrit
version here adds, 'that is, he thinks well of Aharman and the demons;'
and in PA10 it continues thus: 'the atheist's religion, the wicked way
*that* there is no creator, there is no heaven, there is no hell, there
is no resurrection, *and* so on; such is the meaning.'

<span id="fn_380"></span>[72:3](sbe24042.htm#fr_385) From Av.
ashemaogha, 'disturbing righteousness.' Nêr. adds in Sanskrit, 'that is,
having thoroughly known the meaning of the Avesta, he becomes deceived.'

<span id="fn_381"></span>[72:4](sbe24042.htm#fr_386) As the verb in § 23
can apply, in Pahlavi, to any number of preceding sections, it is
omitted by K43 in § 19-22. The verb is also omitted by K43 in § 25 for a
similar reason.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[72:5](sbe24042.htm#fr_387) Or 'breach of
contract.'

<span id="fn_383"></span>[73:1](sbe24042.htm#fr_388) Such appears to be
the meaning of zanŏ-î kârân. L19 has zan-î kasân, 'the wives of others.'

<span id="fn_384"></span>[73:2](sbe24042.htm#fr_389) Or 'irreverent,'
according as we read a*r*âstô or anâstŏ.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[73:3](sbe24042.htm#fr_390) L19 has 'secluded
and departed,' similar to Chap. XXXVII, 23.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[73:4](sbe24042.htm#fr_391) It is doubtful
whether sîpan*g*, 'a halting-place,' or sîpô*g*, 'setting aside,' should
be read; but the meaning is practically the same.
