<p>1. Again, about the existence of a competing <I>and</I> different original evolution&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_759"></A><A HREF="#fn_751"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>there</I> are these (2) that are manifest from the good and evil which are in the world, (3) and the particulars of <I>its</I> good maker which are self-limited. 4. Such as darkness and light, (5) erudition <I>and</I> ignorance, (6) perfume and stench, (7) life and death, (8) sickness and health, (9) order (d&acirc;<I>d</I>) and disorder, (10) distress and freedom from care (&acirc;<I>z</I>&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;h), (11) <I>and</I> other co-existing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_760"></A><A HREF="#fn_752"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> factors whose certain existence is visible in every district <I>and</I> land, and every age. 12. So that no district <I>or</I> land whatever is discovered, nor yet any age <I>has</I> existed <I>or</I> shall exist, (13) wherein these good and bad terms and particulars <I>have</I> not existed <I>or</I> do not exist. 14. And it is not possible to say, as to any place <I>or</I> age, that good and evil are changeable in themselves by their own nature.</p>  
<p>15. So, moreover, of the other co-existences whose difference is not through different duty, through different species, <I>or</I> through different quality&#151;(16) as the difference of those of a like nature among one another, such as male <I>and</I> female, (17) <I>of</I> the varieties</p>

</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of scents <I>and</I> flavours, and <I>of</I> the sun <I>and</I> moon <I>and</I> stars, whose difference is not through different nature, but through different duty, through different qualification, and through different construction, which are such as are attainable for various duties&#151;(18) the good and evil, light and dark, <I>and</I> other different natures are then their distinction not through different duty, but through different nature, (19) the incompatible quality and the injuriousness which are manifest <I>in</I> them, one towards the other. 20. Therefore, when good is there&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_761"></A><A HREF="#fn_753"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the non-existence of evil is unquestionable; (21) when light <I>has</I> come, darkness is removed. 22. Even so <I>of</I> the other co-existences&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_762"></A><A HREF="#fn_754"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> whose incompatibility and injuriousness together are owing to the cause of difference of nature, (23) because, in the worldly <I>existence, there</I> is a manifestation of the competing nature and injuriousness of the things, one towards the other.</p>  
<p>24. The worldly <I>existence</I> is the fruit of the spiritual, and the spiritual is its root, (25) because fruit is obtained through a root. 26. <I>In</I> like manner the giver of the evidence arisen among the intelligent is clear. 27. Of the worldly <I>existence being</I> the fruit, <I>and</I> the spiritual being the root, the evidence is this, (28) when the progress (ma<I>d</I>an&#335;) of every visible <I>and</I> tangible thing from imperceptibility to perceptibility is explicitly manifest. 29. Because the arising of mankind and other creatures,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A></p>  
<p>who are visible <I>and</I> tangible, from a spiritual <I>existence</I> which is invisible <I>and</I> intangible is known, (30) as much as the mirrored length <I>and</I> breadth of the body <I>being</I> an emanation of itself. 31. And the perceptibility of the body of man and other creatures was imperceptible <I>and</I> invisible in the semen which is <I>derived</I> from <I>their</I> fathers; (32) the semen itself, too, came into perceptibility, visibility, <I>and</I> tangibility in the skin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_763"></A><A HREF="#fn_755"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the fathers.</p>  
<p>33. It is now possible to know inevitably&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_764"></A><A HREF="#fn_756"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that this worldly <I>existence</I>, which is visible <I>and</I> tangible, is produced <I>and</I> has arisen from a spiritual <I>existence</I> which is invisible <I>and</I> intangible. 34. <I>In</I> like manner the lapsing (yehev&ucirc;ntan&#335;) from visibility <I>and</I> tangibility into invisibility <I>and</I> intangibility&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_765"></A><A HREF="#fn_757"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, which are themselves a spiritual <I>state</I>, is unquestionable.</p>  
<p>35. When <I>these</I> are seen by us, in the worldly <I>existence</I>, the competing nature, formation, and injuriousness of one towards the other, even as to the property of the spiritual <I>existence</I>, (36) which is the root of the worldly <I>one</I>; (37) and, <I>in</I> like manner, <I>there</I> is no doubt of the existence of its fruit of worldly possessions; (38) this is that which is manifest as regards a competing nature. 39. Then&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_766"></A><A HREF="#fn_758"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> its purpose and cause <I>were</I> indicated by me above&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_767"></A><A HREF="#fn_759"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, which are the sagaciously working of the creator, (40) who created the creature which is an indicator of the existence <I>of</I> an opponent.</p>

<p>41. For <I>it</I> is known that work due to workers is <I>of</I> two kinds, designed or qualified. 42. That which is designed is <I>of</I> three kinds. 43. Two are due to the wise <I>and</I> sagacious; (44) either through seeking for their own working of advantage and benefit, (45) or <I>through</I> removing <I>and</I> keeping away the harm and evil which are from without. 46. And one is due to the ignorant <I>and</I> unwise, (47) <I>done</I> defectively <I>and</I> without a purpose. 48. From the wise <I>and</I> sagacious, work ought&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_768"></A><A HREF="#fn_760"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> not to arise without a purpose <I>and</I> without a cause.</p>  
<p>49. As the sagacious creator, who is all-knowing, perfectly capable, <I>and</I> fully complete in his own self, <I>has</I> sought that which is not a necessity for any advantage and aggrandizement of his from without&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_769"></A><A HREF="#fn_761"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (50) it is, therefore, necessary to understand that the purpose <I>and</I> causes of his works are <I>of</I> that one kind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_770"></A><A HREF="#fn_762"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, (51) to remove <I>and</I> keep away the harm which is due to his opponent and the injurer who may arise from without, which is itself the purpose and cause of the creation of the creatures. 52. Also this, that that sagacious creator is good-willed, (53) and his will is all goodness. 54. The creatures <I>were</I> also created by him predominantly of his own will. 55. And the completely-stirring desire of him who is good-willed <I>and</I> sagacious is to subdue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_771"></A><A HREF="#fn_763"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> evil <I>and</I> make <I>it</I> extinct, (56) for while evil is not subdued the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A></p>  
<p>will of him who is good-willed is not fulfilled. 57. <I>And</I> this, that the goodness of that sagacious creator is manifest from creativeness, cherishing, and protection, <I>and from</I> commanding <I>and</I> teaching the means of putting away the path of evil and causing forbearance from crime; (58) also from the qualities and powers of the body in pain and sickness from without.</p>  
<p>59. And, as a cause of the body, (60) to remove and keep away the opponent who comes to the body, <I>and to be</I> the maintenance, the cause of maturity, and the cause of growth of animals <I>and</I> sprouting plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_772"></A><A HREF="#fn_764"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, through the power of maintaining <I>and</I> cherishing <I>their</I> qualities, <I>there</I> is a co-operator who is scripturally called the Fravash&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_773"></A><A HREF="#fn_765"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 61. And through those four powers that are accumulative, which are the powers of attracting, seizing, digesting, <I>and</I> extracting&#151;(62) and which, owing to the creator's sagacity of every kind, are co-operators with proportionate power for keeping away the pain and sickness of various kinds which are owing to the opponent, who is working defectively <I>and</I> desirous of evil&#151;(63) and <I>through</I> others <I>that</I> are of like strength <I>and</I> auxiliary, the good will of the creator is manifest.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A></p>  
<p>64. Of this, too, that this <I>one</I> is no creator of the pain and death which are dissipaters of the body, who is good-willed <I>and</I> a maintainer and cherisher of the body, (65) the evidence is even from this, when the sagacious creator is not a sufferer from sorrow (apakhshad&acirc;r) and performing penitence, (66) and is no dissipater and disabler of his own achievements&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_774"></A><A HREF="#fn_766"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, (67) because <I>he</I> is sagacious and all-knowing.</p>  
<p>68. <I>As to</I> this <I>other and</I> the sorrow <I>and</I> penitence of the kind which is owing to his own work, it is fitting to speak about him <I>as</I> of deficient knowledge, incomplete wisdom, and inconclusive understanding. 69. As work does not arise from the wise and sagacious without a purpose <I>and</I> without a cause&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_775"></A><A HREF="#fn_767"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (70) <I>in</I> like manner work from the unwise <I>and</I> ignorant <I>and</I> those of inconclusive understanding is all defective, without a purpose, <I>and</I> without a cause&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_776"></A><A HREF="#fn_768"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 71. And that sagacious <I>one</I> is a contriver, working sagaciously <I>and</I> methodically, for keeping away that defective work and inconclusive understanding from his own creatures.</p>  
<p>72. He who is working defectively produced distorted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_777"></A><A HREF="#fn_769"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> <I>and</I> entangled scriptures among the creatures; (73) because this is known, that it is not possible so to keep away <I>and</I> cramp&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_778"></A><A HREF="#fn_770"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> him who is a moving <I>and</I> living nature in a boundless void, <I>and</I></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to become without risk of injury&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_779"></A><A HREF="#fn_771"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 74. But, though he does not become entangled, fenced in, and captive, (75) <I>he</I> is spreading anguish into the entanglement and captivity, and <I>it</I> is a means of grievous punishment. 76. Only while a complete wiping away of the anguish <I>due to</I> him, and complete information as to his own ignorant activity do not arise, he <I>has</I> meditated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_780"></A><A HREF="#fn_772"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with lying falsehood on that which is connected therewith. 77. And the complete capability of the almighty creator is the wiping away of the anguish.</p>  
<p>78. Owing to the complete wiping away of anguish, through the almightiness of the sagacious creator, he casts <I>him</I> back impotent into the boundless void. 79. <I>And</I> the good creatures thereby become fearless, immortal, <I>and</I> undistressed (80) <I>through</I> the completely methodical sagacity and discernment of means of that omniscient creator of good beings.</p>  
<p>81. From observation of possessions the difference of things is manifest. 82. And the difference is <I>of</I> two kinds, as mentioned above&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_781"></A><A HREF="#fn_773"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 83. One is difference of operation, and the other is difference of nature. 84. Difference of operation is owing to mutual assistance and united strength&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_774"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, (85) and difference of nature is owing to want of an adapter</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and <I>to</I> opposition. 86. And not in a single place is a permanence of possessions manifest.</p>  
<p>87. If one of anything shall exist <I>and</I> one does not exist, <I>its</I> name shall exist, (88) for the sake of recognising things, one from the other, and preserving the name. 89. The bad, by separation from the good existence, is originally evolved <I>in</I> such a manner that the one is really no cause of the other. 90. Because each one is existent (a&icirc;t-h&ocirc;mand) through its own self, (91) owing to the perpetual injury <I>and</I> antagonism which are manifestly theirs, one towards the other.</p>  
<p>92. If any one shall say that, as the competing <I>formations</I> of the competitors are numerous&#151;(93) such as good <I>and</I> evil, dark <I>and</I> light, perfume <I>and</I> stench, life <I>and</I> death, sickness <I>and</I> health, pleasure <I>and</I> vexation&#151;(94) there ought to be many other such original evolutions, many <I>in</I> number and of many species; (95) then they <I>may</I> give this reply&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_783"></A><A HREF="#fn_775"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, (96) that, even when <I>there</I> are many names and many species of competitors, still then all are within the compass&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_776"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of two names. 97. And these two names are their including-source, which are good and evil. 98. Their different names and different species are tokens of these two sources.</p>  
<p>99. <I>There</I> is nothing whatever that is not <I>in</I> the compass of these two names. 100. <I>There has</I> not been and <I>will</I> not be anything which is not good or evil, or a mixture of both. 101. On which account</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A></p>  
<p><I>it</I> is explicitly manifest that the original evolutions are two, <I>and</I> not more; (102) <I>and</I> also this, that it is not possible <I>for</I> good to arise from evil, and evil from good.</p>  
<p>103. From this, too, it is possible to understand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_777"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, (104) that it is not possible <I>for</I> complete evil to arise from that thing which is filled with goodness. 105. If it be possible, then <I>it</I> is not full; (106) because <I>any</I> one thing, when said <I>to be</I> full, is no place <I>for</I> anything else; (107) and when <I>there</I> is no place <I>for</I> anything else, other things are not improved by it.</p>  
<p>108. If the sacred being <I>be</I> perfect in goodness and wisdom, the folly and evil of <I>any</I> one are known not to arise from him. 109. If it be possible for them to arise from him, then <I>he</I> is not perfect. 110. If <I>he be</I> not perfect, it is not proper to glorify <I>him</I> for the sacredness of complete goodness. 111. If good and evil have crept on from the sacred being, <I>he</I> is imperfect in goodness. 112. If <I>he be</I> imperfect in goodness, <I>he</I> is imperfect in good information. 113. If<I>he be</I> imperfect in good information, so also <I>he</I> is imperfect in wisdom, understanding, knowledge, intellect, and other appliances of sagacity. 114. If <I>he be</I> imperfect in wisdom, understanding, intellect, <I>and</I> knowledge, <I>he</I> is imperfect in health. 115. If <I>he be</I> imperfect in health, he is apt to become sick. 116. If he be apt to become sick, <I>he</I> is imperfect in life.</p>  
<p>117. If any one shall speak thus: 'I always see that from one nature, such as <I>that of</I> mankind, alike good and alike evil have always crept on, through actions owing to them,' (118) that is for this reason,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A></p>  
<p>because mankind are not perfect even in one <I>thing</I>. 119. And on account of imperfection in goodness, evil has crept on from them; (120) and also on account of imperfection, even in health, they become sick. 121. For the same reason they die, (122) because the cause of death is the struggling of two competing propensities within one nature. 123. There where two competing propensities exist within one nature, the occurrence of sickness and death is known.</p>  
<p>124. If any one shall say that there are good and evil actions which, until they are done, do not exist, (125) then they <I>may</I> give this reply&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_786"></A><A HREF="#fn_778"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, (126) that the occurrence of an action apart from doing is as impossible as any propensity apart from a nature; and, as to the nature, (127) its&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_779"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> continuance and arrangement are then known thereby not to occur through its own self. 128. For when a man indulges in wrath, Voh&ucirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_788"></A><A HREF="#fn_780"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is far from there; (129) and when Voh&ucirc;man holds the position, wrath is not there. 130. When a man tells a lie, truth is far from there&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_789"></A><A HREF="#fn_781"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; (131) and when he speaks true, falsehood has no position there, and that man is called truthful. 132. So also when sickness <I>has</I> come, health is not there; (133) and when health <I>has</I> come, sickness <I>has</I> gone.</p>
