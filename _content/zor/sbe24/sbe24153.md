### CHAPTER LXV.

1\. The sixty-fifth subject is this, that every one is to practise
thanksgiving continually, *and* it is requisite *that* he maintains *it*
through good and bad; and *he is* to keep in view <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[3](#fn_1411) the benefits of Hôrmazd. 2. Because
the creator <span id="fr_1423"></span>[4](#fn_1412) Hôrmazd demands two
things from mankind, the one is that *one should* not commit sin, and
the other is that *one should* practise thanksgiving. 3. And how much
soever more grateful mankind become, through virtue *and* worthiness as
regards him, they <span id="fr_1424"></span>[5](#fn_1413) grant more
abundant daily provision for the grateful than that which is for other
persons. 4. And *as to* every one who is not grateful *to* him, the
bread that he eats becomes unlawful, and it is not proper for any one to
do good *in connection* with him.

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

5\. And it is declared in revelation that when an unthankful person
dies, wherever they deposit. His corpse, the archangel
Spendârma*d* <span id="fr_1425"></span>[1](#fn_1414) is trembling like a
sheep that sees a wolf. 6. And *as to* a bird that eats that corpse, on
whatever tree it rests and settles, it makes that tree wither away, and
the person *who* sits down in the shadow of the tree becomes ill.

7\. There are different things that it is necessary for those of the
good religion to make predominant over themselves. 8. One is to exercise
liberality *in connection* with the worthy; the second is to do justice;
the third is to be friendly unto every one; and the fourth is to be
sincere and true <span id="fr_1426"></span>[2](#fn_1415), and to keep
falsehood far from themselves. 9. And these four habits (‘*h*aʓlat) are
the principles (aʓl) of the religion of Zaratu*s*t, and it is necessary,
when thou listenest *to them* thyself, *that* thou dost not listen to
any one *else* <span id="fr_1427"></span>[3](#fn_1416). 10. Because the
creator Hôrmazd says, 'O Zaratu*s*t! if thou wilt that thou become pure
and saved, *and that* thou arrive at the place of the pure, do thou
accomplish these two duties:—11. One is this, that thou prefer the
friendship of the spiritual *existence to that of* the worldly *one*,
and consider the things of the world as contemptible and those of the
spirit precious; on this account the glory of the world is sought <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[4](#fn_1417) with scorn, and do not thou let the
spirit escape. 12. The second is this, that thou speak truly with every
one and act justly with me,

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

that is, whatever thou dost not approve for thyself do not approve <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1](#fn_1418) for any one *else;* when thou hast
acted in this manner thou art righteous.'
