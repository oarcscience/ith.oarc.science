<p>1. The forty-third subject is this, that it is necessary to make an endeavour to kill noxious creatures <I>and</I> reptiles (&#145;ha<I>s</I>ar&acirc;t) of the earth; because, in revelation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1322"></A><A HREF="#fn_1311"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, it is put <I>forth as</I> a great good work.</p>  
<p>2. Especially these five things:&#151;One is the frog in the water, the second is the snake and scorpion, the third is the ant (mar<I>k</I>is)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1323"></A><A HREF="#fn_1312"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that flies, the fourth is the <I>common</I> ant (m&ocirc;r<I>k</I>ah), and the fifth is the mouse. 3. Therefore&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1324"></A><A HREF="#fn_1313"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, every time that they bring a frog up, out of the water, and make <I>it</I> dry, and, after (ba&#146;hd) that, kill it, it is a good work of a thousand <I>and</I> two hundred dirhams <I>in</I> weight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1325"></A><A HREF="#fn_1314"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 4. And every time that they kill a snake, and recite the Avesta that is <I>appointed</I> for that <I>occasion</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1326"></A><A HREF="#fn_1315"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, it is</p>

<p>just as though they have slain an apostate (&acirc;shm&ocirc;<I>gh</I>). 5. For every one who kills a <I>flying</I> ant (mar<I>k</I>is) it is as much good work as <I>for</I> any one who is reciting <I>inward</I> prayer <I>for</I> ten days. 6. Among the creatures of Aharman nothing whatever is more harmful than this; for, if it dies in the air (hav&acirc;) it becomes a gnat, if it dies in the dust it becomes a worm, if it dies in the water it becomes a leech&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1327"></A><A HREF="#fn_1316"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, if it dies among the excavators of flesh it becomes a venomous snake (m&acirc;r-i af&#146;ha&icirc;), and if it dies in dung it becomes creeping <I>things</I>. 7. <I>For</I> every one who kills a corn-dragging ant it is as much good work as <I>for</I> any one <I>who</I> recites the H&ocirc;rmazd Ya<I>s</I>t. 8. And <I>for</I> every one who kills many noxious creatures it is as much good work as <I>for</I> a priest who performs the ceremonial of the sacred beings; both good works are equal. 9. <I>For</I> every one who kills a mouse it is as much good work as <I>if</I> four lions are killed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1328"></A><A HREF="#fn_1317"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 10. Therefore, it is incumbent on every one to make an effort to kill a noxious creature.</p>
