<p>1. The sixtieth subject is this, that we are keeping the good <I>and</I> pure religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers with us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1391"></A><A HREF="#fn_1380"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, so that escape from hell <I>may</I> be possible for our souls&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1392"></A><A HREF="#fn_1381"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 2. And we are completely united in hope, and through investigation (ta&#145;hq&icirc;q) we fully understand that, when we are steadfast in the good religion, we arrive in heaven. 3. And we know that arrival in heaven occurs through virtuous actions, and through them we are saved; so that we think of good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1393"></A><A HREF="#fn_1382"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, speak of good, and do good.</p>  
<p>4. And no doing of good is better than that which <I>offers itself</I> when a difficult duty comes before one of the good religion as his soul wishes to depart. 5. Since it comes to thee, do thou give help <I>to</I> that which has escaped <I>his</I> hand, so that he <I>may</I> come out of that hindrance; and do thou not forsake <I>him</I></p>

<p>so that he relinquishes the religion. 6. For after that, while he is in the religion, <I>and</I> while his children, after him, are in the religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1394"></A><A HREF="#fn_1383"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, every duty and good work that he does&#151;and <I>his</I> children&#151;is just like those which are done by <I>thine</I> own hand.</p>  
<p>7. And <I>it is</I> just like that with regard to poll-tax, it is also indispensable to give <I>it</I> in semblance of help, so that they <I>may</I> give that person <I>his</I> release (&#145;<I>h</I>al&acirc;&#659;), and he <I>may</I> stay in his own place, <I>and</I> the advantage of a good work (THav&acirc;b) <I>may</I> come to that <I>other person</I>.</p>
