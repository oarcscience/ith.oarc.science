### CHAPTER LXI.

1\. The sixty-first subject is this, that it is requisite to abstain
strictly from speaking falsehood; so that, every time that mankind
indulge in the speaking of falsehood with fondness <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[2](#fn_1384), it is not proper to do *so;*
and <span id="fr_1396"></span>[3](#fn_1385) falsehood is the chief <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[4](#fn_1386) of all sins.

2\. Zaratu*s*t enquired of Hôrmazd thus: 'Who is a liar like?' 3.
Hôrmazd, the good *and* propitious, said: 'A liar is a co-operator with
Aharman.'

4\. In revelation it says that *there* is no hereafter (â‘*h*irat) for
the speakers of falsehood, and in the midst of mankind they are
contemptible (‘haqîr). 5. If *such* a man be powerful (mu‘hta*s*im),
*and there* be no avoiding (‘haDHar) him in the vicinity

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

of mankind, they do not have any respect *for him*, and he is clearly
(farʓ̣âm) an evil liar. 6. Although he possesses much wealth, it will all
depart from his hands, and, finally (’hâqibat), begging of mankind
occurs to him, and his progeny also becomes scanty <span
id="fr_1398"></span>[1](#fn_1387).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1384"></span>[322:2](sbe24149.htm#fr_1395) Lp omits these
fourteen words.

<span id="fn_1385"></span>[322:3](sbe24149.htm#fr_1396) B20 omits these
twenty words.

<span id="fn_1386"></span>[322:4](sbe24149.htm#fr_1397) This seems to
have been the meaning intended, judging from § 2-6; otherwise it might
be translated 'end' or 'result,' especially as the writer has
characterised other sins as 'the chief' (see Chaps. IX, 2, XXV, 8).

<span id="fn_1387"></span>[323:1](sbe24149.htm#fr_1398) Lp omits these
six words.
