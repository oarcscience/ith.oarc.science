### CHAPTER IX.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Is it possible to go
from region to region <span id="fr_205"></span>[6](#fn_202),or not?

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 3. From what
substance is the sky made? 4. And how and in what manner is the mingling
of the water in the earth?'

5\. The spirit of wisdom answered (6) thus: 'Without the permission of
the sacred beings, or the permission of the demons, it is then <span
id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_203) not possible for one to go from region
to region <span id="fr_207"></span>[2](#fn_204).

7\. 'The sky is made from the substance of the blood-stone <span
id="fr_208"></span>[3](#fn_205), such as they also call diamond
(almâst).

8\. 'And the mingling of the water in the earth is just like the blood
in the body of man.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_202"></span>[35:6](sbe24015.htm#fr_205) The earth is
supposed to be divided into seven regions, of which the central one is
as large as the other six united; two of <span id="page_36">p. 36</span>
the six lie to the north, two to the south, one to the east, and one to
the west; and they are said to be separated by seas or mountains,
difficult to cross (see Bd. XI). For their names, see Chaps. XVI, 10,
XXVII, 40.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[36:1](sbe24015.htm#fr_206) Instead of
adîna*s*, 'then for one,' Nêr. has manufactured a word ainâ, 'otherwise'
(see also Chap. VII, 19 n).

<span id="fn_204"></span>[36:2](sbe24015.htm#fr_207) This information is
derived from Pahl. Vend. I, 4 *a*.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[36:3](sbe24015.htm#fr_208) Or 'ruby,'
referring to the rosy tints of dawn and sunset. The same statement is
made in Bd. XII, 6. Nêr. has 'steel,' and the word can be translated
'blood-metal.'
