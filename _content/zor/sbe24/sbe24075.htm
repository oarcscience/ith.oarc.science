<p>1. Another subject, among the assertors of the non-existence of a sacred being, is about the existence of the sacred being and his competitor.</p>  
<p>2. Of the knowledge approvable by wisdom and the statements of the limits of evidence, <I>about</I> the existence of the sacred being and his competitor, (3)</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A></p>  
<p>this is a summary:&#151;<I>One</I> knows it should be enjoined, that the supreme first knowledge, most <I>suitable</I> for the well-discerning, is comprehending the sacred being. 4. He, of whom this knowledge is not the leader of knowledge, is unaided by other knowledge. 5. Comprehending the sacred being is possible through undecayed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_720"></A><A HREF="#fn_712"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> understanding, fervent intellect, and decisive wisdom.</p>  
<p>6. Since comprehending the sacred being is not, thus far, more than <I>that one</I> knows that a sacred being exists, (7) because whoever is acquainted with the existence of a certain thing, and is unaware of its nature, is thinking thus, that that thing is good or bad, erudite or ignorant, antidote or poison, cold <I>and</I> frozen or hot and scorching, dry <I>and</I> withering or damp, (8) and, when unaware of its nature, his only knowledge of it is then useless&#151;(9) for it is possible to cause the commendation and condemnation of any person <I>or</I> thing, not through <I>its</I> existence but through <I>its</I> nature&#151;(10) <I>therefore one</I> knows this should be also enjoined, that a knowledge of&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_721"></A><A HREF="#fn_713"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> anything is <I>acquired</I> in three modes:&#151;(11) by knowing <I>what</I> is inevitable, or by knowing <I>what</I> is analogous, or by <I>what</I> is possible <I>and</I> fit to exist.</p>  
<p>12. Inevitable knowledge is such as once one is one, and twice two are four. 13. For within the bounds of the really inevitable it is not possible to say, (14) that <I>there</I> was <I>or will</I> be a time, or a place, where twice two are said <I>to be</I> five or three.</p>  
<p>15. Knowledge <I>by</I> analogy is that which announces, from anything manifest, something which is not</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A></p>  
<p>manifest, (16) and brings, out of anything visible, something invisible, in the likeness of a hand put up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_722"></A><A HREF="#fn_714"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for the household service of the perception of wisdom, (17) through complete similarity, resemblance, <I>or</I> partial resemblance.</p>  
<p>18. Complete similarity is such as <I>that of</I> a man of P&acirc;rs to a man of another district. 19. Resemblance is such as <I>that of</I> cheese to the white of an egg. 20. And partial resemblance is such as <I>that of</I> cheese to chalk, (21) since this is about the limit of partial resemblance, because cheese is like unto chalk only in whiteness, (22) <I>but to</I> the white of an egg in whiteness and also as food.</p>  
<p>23. And there is also <I>that</I> which is called more resembling than resemblance, and more partially resembling <I>than</I> partial resemblance. 24. That which is more <I>than</I> complete similarity is not spoken about, (25) because completion does not become more complete.</p>  
<p>26. By this mode <I>it</I> is set forth a second time at more length. 27. To demonstrate an invisible from a visible thing is such as from a thing made and maintained, which is not domestically serving the maker and maintainer, (28) and from a thing written, whose writer is not declared, (29) are manifest a maker of that <I>which is</I> made, a maintainer of that <I>which is</I> maintained, <I>and</I> a writer of that <I>which is</I> written, who are inevitable, (30) because that which is not manifest <I>and</I> is invisible is demonstrated by the thing which is manifest and visible.</p>  
<p>31. Information of that which is within the possible <I>and</I> fit to exist is credible, (32) such as what <I>one</I></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A></p>  
<p>states thus: 'I saw a man by whom a lion, or a lion by whom a man, <I>was</I> slain outright.' 33. And this, <I>being</I> that which is within the limits of the possible <I>and</I> fit to exist, may be a lie. 34. But when a man announces that intelligence, who is renowned for truth and tested in judgment, it is within the limits of truth and reality. 35. If a man announces <I>it</I>, who is disgraced by falsehood and tested in misjudgment, it is within the limits of falsehood and unreality.</p>  
<p>36. Another mode, outside of these <I>and</I> within the limits of the inevitable, is <I>by knowing what has</I> not occurred <I>and</I> is not possible; (37) such as what <I>one</I> states thus: 'It is possible to bring the world, in secrecy, into the inside of an egg,' (38) or 'it is possible <I>for</I> an elephant to pass into an eye of a needle,' (39) <I>in</I> such a manner <I>as</I> though one <I>of them</I> really becomes no greater and no less, (40) or <I>its</I> substance is something which is not a rudiment.</p>  
<p>41. A struggle which should not be limited, (42) an existing thing which is not temporary and localised, (43) or is localised <I>and</I> not limited, (44) the working of a vain miracle, (45) and other <I>things</I> of this description of speaking <I>and</I> imagining are faulty and false and not possible.</p>  
<p>46. Then&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_723"></A><A HREF="#fn_715"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the knowledge of the existence of him who is the exalted sacred being, apart from tangibility of nature and other evidence, is through the inevitable and analogy, (47) as much visible before the sight of wisdom as from the prosperity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_724"></A><A HREF="#fn_716"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, formation, and organization which are, according to different</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A></p>  
<p>statements of many kinds, the formation of the things of the world and mankind whose particles, <I>and</I> the appliances which are owing thereto, are such as the elements of the body <I>and</I> life, from which&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_725"></A><A HREF="#fn_717"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they are prepared <I>and</I> formed, (48) which are fire, water, air, <I>and</I> earth, (49) that are, each separately, a stimulus so qualified and ennobled for their own operations, (50) that the operation of fire, through its own quality (<I>k</I>&icirc;har&icirc;h) and nobility (v&acirc;sp&ucirc;harak&acirc;n&icirc;h), is such that the operations of water, air, <I>and</I> earth are not to stimulate unrestricted (atang)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_726"></A><A HREF="#fn_718"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by it. 51. Thus, also, the operation of water, through its own quality, is such that the operations of air, fire, <I>and</I> earth are not <I>unrestricted</I> by it. 52. So, also, of air, the operations of fire, water, <I>and</I> earth are not <I>unrestricted by it</I>. 53. So, also, of earth, the operations of these <I>others</I> are to stimulate not unrestricted <I>by it</I>. 54. But each separately is for its own operation, just as they are ennobled <I>and</I> qualified (55) by him who is, sagaciously <I>and</I> methodically, a qualifier, a constructor, and an ennobler. 56. <I>And</I> the organization is constructed, prepared, qualified, <I>and</I> ennobled as is suitable for those operations.</p>  
<p>57. So, also, <I>as to</I> mankind and the other creatures, who are the germinating of these elements, (58) whose organization of bone, fat, sinew, veins, and skin, each separately (59) without sympathy, one for the other, is visible altogether. 60. Thus, too, are the nobility <I>and</I> qualification of the internal organs, (61) such as the liver, heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_727"></A><A HREF="#fn_719"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, lungs, kidneys, gall-bladder, <I>and</I></p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_144"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 144</FONT></A></p>  
<p>other appliances, <I>for</I> every one of which a function of its own is manifest. 62. They are qualified <I>and</I> ennobled for their defence by those functions which are their own.</p>  
<p>63. So, also, is the qualification of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, mouth, teeth, hand, foot, <I>and</I> other external appliances, whose own functions are each separate. 64. And <I>it</I> is visibly manifest therein; inasmuch as, when one of these organs is disabled, any <I>one</I> of the rest is not suitable for the work of that other <I>one</I>, for which it is not qualified. 65. And when only the construction of one of the organs of the body is examined into&#151;that is, how <I>it is</I>&#151;it is wonderfully sagaciously constructed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_728"></A><A HREF="#fn_720"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>66. Such as the eye, which is of many natures of different names and different purposes, (67) as the eyelash, the eyelid, the white, the eyeball (kh&acirc;yak), the iris (s&acirc;yak), <I>and</I> the pupil (t&ecirc;<I>d</I>ak), (68) <I>in</I> such way that the white is fat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_729"></A><A HREF="#fn_721"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (69) the iris is water which <I>has</I> so stood in the prison&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_730"></A><A HREF="#fn_722"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of fat that the turning of the eye, from side to side, occurs through it, (70) <I>and</I> the pupil, itself the sight, is like a view into the water. 71. The iris stands in the prison of white, like the standing of water in a prison of fat; (72) and the pupil is within the iris, like the view of a thing within clear water, (73) <I>or</I> the form of a column in</p>

<p>a shining mirror. 74. And the arrangement of the white <I>in</I> the orbit is for the reason that the dust whirling from the atmosphere, when it arrives at the eye, shall not be concealed in it, (75) <I>but</I> shall turn to the lid (gumb) of the eye, (76) and shall not injure the sight of the eye. 77. Just as the construction of the tube (rag) of the ear is undilated (af&acirc;hal), for the reason (78) that whirls of dust and winged noxious creatures shall not rightly enter therein. 79. And the moisture of oneself, the secretion of the ear, and the venom of noxious creatures are manifestly as <I>useful</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_731"></A><A HREF="#fn_723"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>80. When the appliances of life and soul are observed&#151;(81) such as the smell, hearing; sight, taste, and touch which are causing the intelligence of living beings, (82) as also the wisdom of every pontiff (ra<I>d</I>), <I>which</I> is pronounced decisive, (83) the knowledge which is acquiring, (84) the intellect which is a seeker <I>and</I> transmitter, (85) the understanding which is a treasurer <I>and</I> defender, (86) the consciousness which is itself the sight of the soul, (87) the guardian spirit (fravash) which is itself the nature that is a maintainer of the body, (88) the spiritual life (ah&ucirc;) which is pure, (89) and the other spiritual <I>existences</I> that are maintaining the body, which are each separately qualified, in that manner&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_732"></A><A HREF="#fn_724"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>for</I> their operation and duty&#151;(90) they are perfect in their own operation, as to duty such as they are ennobled <I>and</I> qualified <I>for</I>. 91. As to that <I>for</I> which they are not qualified, they are not suitable.</p>
