<p>1. <I>In</I> the name of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, the lord, the greatest and wise, [the all-ruling, all-knowing, and almighty, (2) who is a spirit even among spirits, (3) and from his self-existence, single in unity, <I>was</I> the creation of the faithful. 4. He also created, by his own unrivalled power, the seven supreme archangels&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_634"></A><A HREF="#fn_626"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,] all the angels of the spiritual <I>and</I> worldly <I>existences</I>, (5) and the seven worldly characteristics&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_635"></A><A HREF="#fn_627"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> which are man, animals, fire, metal, earth, water, <I>and</I> plants.</p>  
<p>6. And man <I>was</I> created by him, as a control of the creatures, for the advancement of <I>his</I> will. 7. From him likewise came&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_636"></A><A HREF="#fn_628"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> <I>at</I> various times, through</p>

<p>his own compassion, mercifulness to his own creatures, religion, and a natural desire of the knowledge of purity <I>and</I> contamination. 8. So, also, <I>as to</I> the intellect, understanding, wisdom, knowledge, consciousness, <I>and</I> guardian spirit&#151;which are the appliances of the soul that are seeking information of these spiritual appliances, the five which are the sight, hearing, smell, taste, <I>and</I> touch, (9) through the five worldly appliances, which are the eye, the ear, the nose, the mouth, and the rubbing surfaces of the whole body&#151;(10) he likewise created man with the accompaniment of these appliances, for the management of the creatures.</p>  
<p>11. He also created the religion of omniscience like an immense tree, (12) of which <I>there</I> are one stem, two branches, three boughs, four twigs, <I>and</I> five shoots&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_637"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 13. And its one stem is agreement. 14. The two branches are performance and abstinence. 15. The three boughs are Humat, H&ucirc;kht, <I>and</I> Huvar<I>s</I>t, which are good thoughts, good words, <I>and</I> good deeds. 16. The four twigs are the four classes of the religion, by whom the religion <I>and</I> world are prepared, (17) which are priesthood, warriorship, husbandry, <I>and</I> artisanship. 18. The five shoots are the five rulers whose scriptural names are the house-ruler, the village-ruler, the tribe-ruler, the province-ruler, <I>and</I> the supreme Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t. 19. And the one chief of chiefs, who is the king of kings, is the ruler of the world.</p>  
<p>20. Likewise, the work manifested by him in the world&#151;which is man&#151;is in the likeness of these four</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A></p>  
<p>classes of the world. 21. As unto&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_638"></A><A HREF="#fn_630"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the head is priesthood, (22) unto the hand is warriorship, (23) unto the belly is husbandry, (24) <I>and</I> unto the foot is artisanship.</p>  
<p>25. So, also, of the four capabilities (hunar&acirc;n) that are in man&#151;which are temper, ability, wisdom, <I>and</I> diligence&#151;(26) unto temper (kh&icirc;m) is priesthood, as the greatest duty of priests is the temper that they do not commit sin on account of shame and fear; (27) unto ability (hunar) is warriorship, that is, the most princely adornment of warriors is the ability which is expended, the manliness which is owing to self-possession (khva<I>d</I>&icirc;h); (28) unto husbandmen is the wisdom (khira<I>d</I>) which is strenuous performance of the tillage <I>of</I> the world, <I>and</I> continuance unto the renovation <I>of the universe;</I> (29) <I>and</I> unto artisans is the diligence (tukhsh&acirc;k&icirc;h) which is the greatest advancement of their class.</p>  
<p>30. This arrangement&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_639"></A><A HREF="#fn_631"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of every kind is upon one stem, truth and agreement, opposing the fiend and his appliances which are co-existent. 31. These&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_640"></A><A HREF="#fn_632"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, which are recounted by me, are of many kinds <I>and</I> many species, as many are religious <I>and</I> many believing at a period that all are mutually afflicting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_641"></A><A HREF="#fn_633"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>,</p>

<p>co-existent destroyers <I>and</I> injurers, one as regards the other. 32. <I>And</I> with the mutual afflictiveness, destructiveness, and combativeness which are theirs, one towards the other, they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_642"></A><A HREF="#fn_634"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> afterwards also contend against the one truth co-operatively <I>and</I> with united strength.</p>  
<p>33. The possession of truth is the one power of the faithful, through the singleness of truth. 34. The many kinds of falsehood, <I>which</I> must become confused <I>and</I> mutually afflicting to many, are, in the aggregate, from one source of deceitfulness.</p>  
<p>35. <I>As to</I> that, this composition is provided by me, <I>who</I> am Mar<I>d</I>&acirc;n-farukh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_643"></A><A HREF="#fn_635"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>son</I> of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>-d&acirc;<I>d</I>, as I saw in the age much religiousness <I>and</I> much good consideration of sects (k&ecirc;sh&acirc;n) of many species; (36) and I have been fervent-mindedly, <I>at</I> all times in my whole youthful career, an enquirer <I>and</I> investigator of the truth of them. 37. For the same reason I have wandered forth also to many realms and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_644"></A><A HREF="#fn_636"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the seashore. 38.

<p>it, for these memoranda, from the writings and memoranda of the ancient sages <I>and</I> high-priests of the just&#151;and especially those of the glorified &Acirc;t&ucirc;r-p&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;y&acirc;vand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_647"></A><A HREF="#fn_639"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#151;the name <I>S</I>ikand-g&ucirc;m&acirc;n&icirc;k Vi<I>g</I>&acirc;r&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_648"></A><A HREF="#fn_640"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is appointed by me. 39. As it is very suitable for explaining away the doubts of new learners about the thorough understanding of the truth, the blessedness and truth of the good religion, and the inward dignity of those free from strife.</p>  
<p>40. And it is composed and arranged by me not for the wise and talented, but <I>for</I> preceptors (farhang&icirc;k&acirc;n)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_649"></A><A HREF="#fn_641"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> <I>and</I> those newly qualified. 41. So that, while many become freer from doubt about the miraculousness and blessedness of the statements of the good religion and primitive faith, (42) I am still begging of distinguished sages, (43) that whoever wants to look, should not look&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_650"></A><A HREF="#fn_642"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to the religion of the particular speaker <I>and</I> composer, but to the greatness of the truth, blessedness, and definite statements of the ancient sages. 44. Because I, who am the composer, do not hold the station of teaching, but that of learning.</p>  
<p>45. And it seemed to me, through liberal thought, a statement, from that knowledge of the religion, destined and important even for new learners. 46. Because <I>he</I> who distributes to the worthy, out of the little knowledge which is his, is more acceptable than <I>he</I> who knows much <I>and</I> the worthy are without benefit <I>and</I> without help from him.</p>  
<p>47. Since those ancient sages decided, (48) that liberality is of three kinds, of thought, of word, <I>and</I></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p><A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of deed. 49. Liberality of thought <I>being</I> that whose wishing of happiness for any others whatever, of a like disposition, is as much as for its own. 50. Liberality in word <I>being</I> that which teaches to the worthy <I>something</I> out of every virtuous knowledge and information which have come to it; (51) just as that which a <I>certain</I> sage said (52) thus: 'I desire that I <I>may</I> understand all information which is advantageous, and I <I>will</I> teach <I>it</I> to friends and acquire the result which is obtainable.' 53. <I>And</I> the liberality which is in deed <I>being</I> that which, out of any benefit whatever that has come to it, is a benefit to the worthy.</p>  
<p>54. Again, <I>it</I> is a reminding of the good as to the preservation of the soul; (55) <I>and</I> for the same reason I <I>have</I> arranged that while the wise are kindly observant of me, through their own compassion, they <I>may</I> remember about the immortality of the soul. 56. Since it is said, that the eye of him who observes all good creatures with kind eyes is the eye of the sun; (57) because the sun is, indeed, an observer and beautifier with kind eyes for all creatures.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_626"></A><A HREF="sbe24071.htm#fr_634">117:1</A> The passage in brackets is omitted in several Pahl. MSS., many of which commence at this point, but it is found in K28, BM, and others, and also in the P&acirc;z. MSS. and Sans. version. The first epithet, 'all-ruling,' which it contains is likewise omitted in a few P&acirc;z. MSS., while others add a further laudatory passage at that point, which is evidently a modern interpolation. The seven archangels include A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> himself (see Bd. I, 26 n).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_627"></A><A HREF="sbe24071.htm#fr_635">117:2</A> So in the Pahl. MSS. and Sans. version, and also in MH 19 and PB3, which latter follows the oldest P&acirc;z. MS. (AK) very closely; but &sect;&sect; 1-16 have been lost from AK itself. Several other P&acirc;z. MSS. substitute 'creations.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_628"></A><A HREF="sbe24071.htm#fr_636">117:3</A> So understood by N&ecirc;ry&ocirc;sang, but the original Pahlavi could have been translated by 'he likewise sent,' because the Huzv&acirc;ri<I>s</I> y&acirc;t&ucirc;n<I>d</I>, 'came,' and <I>s</I>e<I>d</I><I>r</I>un<I>d</I>, 'sent,' are written alike.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_629"></A><A HREF="sbe24071.htm#fr_637">118:1</A> The last two terms were, no doubt, Pahl. <I>s</I>&acirc;k and barg-g&acirc;h, of which the P&acirc;z. d&ecirc;<I>s</I>aa and br&icirc;<I>s</I>aa are merely misreadings.</P>

He lived probably in the eighth or ninth century of the Christian era, as he mentions the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I> edited by &Acirc;t&ucirc;<I>r</I>-fr&ocirc;bag in Chaps. IV, 107, V, 92, IX, 1, 4, X, 57, XII, 1, and also the R&ocirc;shan commentary prepared by &Acirc;t&ucirc;<I>r</I>-fr&ocirc;bag's son (see Chaps. X, 53, 54, XI, 213); but he does not allude to the later edition of the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I>, prepared by .&Acirc;t&ucirc;r-p&acirc;<I>d</I>, son of H&ecirc;m&icirc;<I>d</I>, who was living in the latter part of the ninth century (see Bd.
