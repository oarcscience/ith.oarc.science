### CHAPTER L <span id="fr_1346"></span>[1](#fn_1335).

1\. The fiftieth subject is this, that, every day *at* dawn, when they
rise up from sleep, it is not proper to wash the hands first with water.

2\. The *ceremonial* ablution is to wash the hands, face, nose, eyes,
and feet thoroughly, either with fruit (mîvah) <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[2](#fn_1336) or some grass upon which no water has
come; afterwards, to make *them* dry, *and* to wash *them* three times
with water *in* such a manner that it becomes wet from the face as far
as the ear <span id="fr_1348"></span>[3](#fn_1337). 3. It is necessary
to keep the mouth closed, so that the water *shall* not go into the
mouth; for if a drop, owing to not stopping, goes into the mouth, it is
a sin of three hundred stîrs <span id="fr_1349"></span>[4](#fn_1338). 4.
Afterwards, *one is* to wash the hands three times with water, as far as
the *upper* arms; first the right hand, *and* afterwards the left hand;
and, *in* like manner, *he is* to wash the right foot and left foot.

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

5\. Then they recite the K*e*m-nâ-mazdâ <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1](#fn_1339), for, every time that they wish to
recite anything as an *inward* prayer, it is necessary that the hands be
washed with *ceremonial* ablution <span
id="fr_1351"></span>[2](#fn_1340), and, if *they are* not, the Avesta is
not accepted, and the fiend of corruption (nasu*s*) does not rush *away,
and* it becomes a Tanâvar sin.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1335"></span>[312:1](sbe24138.htm#fr_1346) Omitted in La,
Lp, though the former contains a portion of this chapter annexed to part
of Chap. XLVIII, and most of its contents are repeated, in other words,
in Chap. LXXIV.

<span id="fn_1336"></span>[312:2](sbe24138.htm#fr_1347) Perhaps mîvah
may be taken as an adjective from mîv, 'hair;' in which case we should
have 'with *something* either hairy or grassy.' According to the
long-metre Sad Dar, the liquid to be used for this first wetting is
either goat's or bull's urine.

<span id="fn_1337"></span>[312:3](sbe24138.htm#fr_1348) La has 'from ear
to ear' (sec Chap. XLVIII, 1 n).

<span id="fn_1338"></span>[312:4](sbe24138.htm#fr_1349) A Tanâvar or
Tanâpûhar sin (see Sls. I, 2).

<span id="fn_1339"></span>[313:1](sbe24138.htm#fr_1350) See Chap. XXXV,
2 n, which chapter, as well as Chap. LXXIV, treats of nearly the same
subject.

<span id="fn_1340"></span>[313:2](sbe24138.htm#fr_1351) As described in
§ 2-4.
