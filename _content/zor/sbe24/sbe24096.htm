<p>1. The eighth subject is this, that it is necessary to maintain the religion by rule (dast&ucirc;r), and to practise obedience to the commands of the high-priests; <I>and</I> every duty that <I>people</I> perform they <I>should</I> perform by their authority.</p>  
<p>2. For it is declared in the good religion, that, if they accomplish as many good works as the leaves of the trees, <I>or</I> the sand<I>-grains</I> of the desert, <I>or</I> the drops (qa<I>t</I>rah) of rain, which they do not perform by command of the high-priests, <I>or</I> to their satisfaction, no merit whatever attains to their souls, and <I>for</I> the good works they have done they obtain sin <I>as</I> a recompense. 3. While <I>such a one</I> is living it is not proper to call him righteous, and when he dies he does not attain to heaven, and not a single archangel comes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1138"></A><A HREF="#fn_1130"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> near him. 4.

<P><A NAME="fn_1132"></A><A HREF="sbe24096.htm#fr_1140">267:2</A> The principles of blind submission of the laity to the priesthood, and complete abnegation of private judgment, which pervade the whole of the Sad Dar, are especially conspicuous in this chapter. They are the ideas prevalent in the darkest ages of the religion, which have now nearly disappeared with the spread of true knowledge as in other faiths.</P>
