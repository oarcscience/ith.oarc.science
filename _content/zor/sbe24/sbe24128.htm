<p>1. The fortieth subject is this, that it is not desirable to distress <I>one's</I> priest, <I>or</I> father, <I>or</I> mother; and, if <I>people</I> perceive much trouble, disquietude, and harm <I>arising</I> from them, it is certainly not desirable that they <I>should</I> give them back a reply with any aggravation. 2. Because their satisfaction is connected with the satisfaction of the sacred being, <I>and</I> every time that <I>people</I> distress them they have</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_302"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 302</FONT></A></p>  
<p>distressed H&ocirc;rmazd, the good <I>and</I> propitious. 3. It is not possible <I>for</I> any duty <I>or</I> good work to extend to the spiritual <I>existences</I> while <I>one</I> does not make those <I>guardians</I> satisfied, and it is not possible (mumkin) that any one <I>should</I> repay these three persons all <I>their</I> dues.</p>  
<p>4. In the commentary of the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht <I>Nask</I> it says:&#151;M&acirc; &acirc;z&acirc;ray&ocirc;i<I>s</I>, Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! m&acirc; Pourushaspem, m&acirc; Dughdh&ocirc;v&atilde;m, m&acirc; a&ecirc;thrapaiti<I>s</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1302"></A><A HREF="#fn_1292"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, 'it is nor desirable that thou, O Zaratu<I>s</I>t! <I>shouldest</I> distress <I>thy</I> father, <I>or</I> mother, <I>or</I> priest.'</p>  
<p>5. Therefore, three times every day it is indispensable <I>for one</I> to fold <I>his</I> arms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1303"></A><A HREF="#fn_1293"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in the presence of these three persons, <I>and</I> to say:&#151;'What is your will (mur&acirc;d)? So that I <I>may</I> think and speak and do it. 6. If <I>what</I> was not proper has come from me of itself, it is necessary that you make a righteous gift on our behalf.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1292"></A><A HREF="sbe24128.htm#fr_1302">302:1</A> This Avesta passage is not known to be extant elsewhere, and its orthography has been corrected in accordance with the translation attached to it by the author of Sd. In La, Lp, J15 the first two names are in the genitive, and the third is accusative; B29 differs by putting the third name also in the genitive; the last word being accusative in all. Pourushaspa and Dughdh&ocirc;va (?) were the names of the father and mother of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, and the latter name has not previously been found in the Avesta texts, but is known only from Pahlavi and Persian writings.</P>
