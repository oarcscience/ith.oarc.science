### CHAPTER XLVI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Which is the
one <span id="fr_473"></span>[4](#fn_468) oppression, as regards men,
*that* Aharman considers as the more injurious and great?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: Aharman, when he wrings life
and wife and child and worldly happiness of every kind away from men,
does not consider, as to this, that any injury whatever is inflicted by
him upon that person; (5) but when he wrings away the soul of a single
*individual*, and makes it utterly depraved, he then considers, as to
this, that "an injury which is complete would thereby be inflicted by
me," because this is done by him through his own depravity of wish and
action <span id="fr_474"></span>[5](#fn_469).'
