### CHAPTER LXX.

1\. The seventieth subject is this, that, *as to* any persons, when they
carry a corpse to the appointed place, it is necessary that two suits of
clothes be put on, on account of this work. 2. It is requisite *for*
those clothes to be on <span id="fr_1461"></span>[2](#fn_1450), and it
is necessary <span id="fr_1462"></span>[3](#fn_1451) to make a dog gaze
at the corpse twice, once *at* the time when life becomes separated
*from* it, and once *at* the time when they wish to take *it* up.

3\. Then it is necessary that both those persons be connected, *and each
of them is* to tie a cord on one of his own hands, so that the hand
*may* go away <span id="fr_1463"></span>[4](#fn_1452) from *that of* the
other one. 4. And, when they are moving, it is necessary for him to be
prepared and not to speak a word with any one. 5. And if it be a
pregnant woman *they are* to take *her* up by four persons, because
there are two corpses <span id="fr_1464"></span>[5](#fn_1453).

6\. When, avoiding dead matter, *one* comes again upon it, *he has*, in
the end, to wash <span id="fr_1465"></span>[6](#fn_1454) with
*ceremonial* ablution <span id="fr_1466"></span>[7](#fn_1455), and that
is requisite for the reason that he

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

may not thereby be rapidly a *cause of* wickedness or death for any
one <span id="fr_1467"></span>[1](#fn_1456).

7\. And if *one* does not show a dog to the corpse, *and* they take *it*
up, how many soever *there* be, the whole *of them* become
polluted <span id="fr_1468"></span>[2](#fn_1457). 8. In the commentary
of the Vendîdâ*d* it is asserted, that every one who takes up a corpse
that a dog *has* not seen is polluted and worthy of death <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[3](#fn_1458), and never becomes clean; his soul
*also* would be wicked.
