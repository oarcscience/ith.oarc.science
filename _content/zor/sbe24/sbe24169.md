### CHAPTER LXXXI.

1\. The eighty-first subject is this, that every duty and good work,
which it is requisite to perform, they *should* accomplish while within
that day, and not postpone for the morrow.

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

2\. For it is declared in revelation, that the creator Hôrmazd spoke to
Zaratu*s*t thus: 'O Zaratu*s*t! I have created no one better than thee
in the world, and after thee I *shall* likewise not create *one;* thou
*art* my chosen one, and I have made this world apparent on account of
thee. 3. And all <span id="fr_1514"></span>[1](#fn_1503) these people
(‘*h*alâîq) whom I have created, and the whole of these monarchs who
have existed and do exist, have always maintained the hope that I
*should* create thee in their days, so that they *should* accept (qabûl
kunand) the religion, and their souls *should* attain to the supreme
heaven.

4\. 'Nevertheless I have created *thee* at the present time, in the
middle period; for it is three thousand years from the days of Gayômard
till now, and from now till the resurrection are the three thousand
years that remain: therefore, I have created thee in the middle. 5. For
whatever is in the middle is more precious and better and more valuable,
*in* the same manner as the heart is in the middle of the whole body
*and* is unquestionably (lâ-*g*arm) very precious <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[2](#fn_1504), *in* the same manner as the land of
*E*rân <span id="fr_1516"></span>[3](#fn_1505) is more valuable than
other lands, for the reason that it is in the middle. 6. And the country
of *E*rân, which is *in* the fourth climate (iqlîm) <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[4](#fn_1506), is better than other places, for the
reason that it is in the middle. 7. Therefore, I have created thee in
the middle, in the manner of *what is* precious, and I have given thee
the apostleship, and have sent *thee* to a monarch, a friend of
knowledge and a friend of religion.

8\. 'Afterwards, I have sent thee, with thus much

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

preciousness, to the people; and the knowledge of the good works that
mankind perform <span id="fr_1518"></span>[1](#fn_1507) in life, and
have not been able to bring to hand without trouble (mi‘hnat), I have
made clear *and* plain unto thee; and I have made thee aware of the
whole of knowledge. 9. I have taught *it* <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[2](#fn_1508) to thee in the Avesta, in a language
that no one in the world considers plain *and* easy; and I have told
thee its interpretation (zand) in a language that is more current among
mankind, and thou likewise hast more eloquence (faʓ‘h) therein.

10\. 'While *thou hast* all this greatness that I have given to thee, O
Zaratu*s*t! I enact a precept for thee, that "every good work which thou
art able to do to-day do not postpone for to-morrow, and accomplish with
thine own hand the counsel of thine own soul." 11. Do not be proud
(*gh*arrah) on the *score* that it is still *the time of* youth, *and*
it is quite possible to do *it hereafter*, while thou thinkest thus: "I
will do *it* after this." 12. For *there* have been many people whose
*remaining* life was one day, and they have been taken *away* in the
presence of fifty years’ work <span id="fr_1520"></span>[3](#fn_1509).'

13\. Therefore, make an effort, so that thou *mayest* not postpone
to-day's duty for to-morrow. 14. Because Aharman, the evil wicked *one*,
has intrusted two fiends with this matter, the name of one is Tardy
(dêr) and the name of the other is Afterwards (pas). 15. Both these
fiends are united, *and* they

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

make an effort and exertion <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1](#fn_1510) with
man, so that his duty falls back behindhand <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[2](#fn_1511). 16. For, *as to* every duty and good
work which comes forward, that fiend whose name is Tardy speaks thus:
'Thou wilt live long, and it is possible to perform this duty *at* all
times;' and that fiend whose name is Afterwards says: 'Pass on now; it
is possible to perform *it* afterwards.' 17. And these two fiends united
keep the soul away from its own duty, till the end arrives; all duties
have fallen back behindhand, and *it has* to experience regret
(‘hasarat) and penitence. 18. It has no benefit through duty *and* good
works, *and* departs from this world.
