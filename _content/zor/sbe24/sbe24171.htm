<p>1. The eighty-third subject is this, that it is requisite to abstain from the keeping of fasts. 2. For, in our religion, it is not proper that they <I>should</I> not eat every day <I>or</I> anything, because it would be a sin <I>not to do so</I>.</p>  
<p>3. With us the keeping of fast is this, that we keep fast from committing sin with <I>our</I> eyes and tongue and ears and hands and feet. 4. Some people are striving about it, so that they <I>may</I> not eat anything all day, and they practise abstinence from eating anything. 5. For us it is also necessary to make an effort, so that we <I>may</I> not think, <I>or</I> speak, <I>or</I> commit any sin; and it is necessary that no bad action <I>should</I> proceed from our hands, <I>or</I> tongue, <I>or</I> ears, <I>or</I> feet, which would be a sin owing to them.</p>  
<p>6. Since I have spoken <I>in</I> this manner, and have brought forward the fasting of the seven members of the body, that which, in other religions, is fasting owing to not eating is, in our religion, fasting owing to not committing sin.</p>
