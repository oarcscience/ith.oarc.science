<p>1. Another <I>subject</I> is about the existence of a competitor of a different nature, as shown above&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_753"></A><A HREF="#fn_745"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, (2) that, from the constructing, qualifying, <I>and</I> ennobling of things so sagaciously, <I>and</I> even from the circumstances of an unimproving (a<I>k</I>&acirc;r&icirc;k) hand put upon the concentrated light, <I>it</I> is manifest that its maker, constructor, concentrator, <I>and</I> qualifier is sagacious. 3. Also his constructing sagaciously is manifest, from each separately, through the qualifying <I>and</I> ennobling of his own works severally. 4. And his working sagaciously is an indicator that his work is purposed <I>and</I> caused, (5) because every one of the works of the sagacious ought to be purposed <I>and</I> caused. 6. The purpose and cause of a work arise first, the work <I>itself</I> afterwards.</p>  
<p>7. From the many kinds of his work <I>it</I> is manifest that his work is willed and requisite. 8. For <I>there</I></p>

<p>are two modes of doing a work, (9) either the willed is <I>of</I> the many kinds which are his will, (to) or the quality is <I>of</I> one kind which is as it is qualified&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_754"></A><A HREF="#fn_746"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; (11) <I>so</I> from the many kinds <I>of</I> work of the creator <I>it</I> is manifest that his work is willed and requisite. 12. And his will is owing to a necessity of different limit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_755"></A><A HREF="#fn_747"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (13) because his will <I>was</I> a requisite for the power of the original evolution.</p>  
<p>14. The purpose and cause of a work are before the necessity, (15) because while the purpose of the necessity of a work does not occur, the necessity does not exist. 16. The purpose of a work arises from the cause, towards which the necessity of that work instigates. 17. The necessity <I>and</I> willing of a thing which is caused exist; (18) and a cause of the necessity of a thing owing to its own self is not well suited, (19) because the cause arises from progression, (20) concerning which an indicator is the purposed work that is sagacious. 21. The purpose is owing to a cause, the cause is owing to promptitude (a&ucirc;st&acirc;<I>v</I>), the promptitude is owing to an exception (ba<I>r</I>&acirc;), the exception is owing to an injurer, and the injury is owing to an opponent, without <I>further</I> words.</p>  
<p>22. I <I>have</I> also shown&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_756"></A><A HREF="#fn_748"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, on this subject, through inevitable knowledge and through analogy, the making and qualification of the world and its circumstances <I>and</I> appliances. 23. From the making and qualification of the world is manifested a maker and qualifier; (24) and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_757"></A><A HREF="#fn_749"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> [through the purposely-made</p>
