### CHAPTER XI.

1\. The eleventh subject is this, that it is necessary to maintain the
fire-place <span id="fr_1157"></span>[3](#fn_1148) properly, and to keep
watch <span id="fr_1158"></span>[4](#fn_1149), so that *the fire shall*
not die *out*, and *that* nothing polluted and impure shall attain to
the fire; and it is necessary to make a menstruous woman avoid *being*
within three steps *of it*.

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

2\. Because every time that they maintain a fire properly, which is
within a dwelling, every fire which is in the earth of seven regions
becomes pleased with those persons, and, when they ask a favour, or beg
a necessity (‘hâ*g*at), it becomes quickly operative. 3. And every time
that *one* does not maintain *it* properly, every fire which is in the
earth of seven regions receives injury from that person, and the
necessity he begs does not become operative. 4. If any one does not
maintain the fire-place properly, if he gives a hundred dînârs <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[1](#fn_1150) to the fire Gu*s*asp <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[2](#fn_1151) *there* is no acceptance *of it*, and
that sin does not depart from him.

5\. For it is declared in revelation <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[3](#fn_1152), that the creator Hôrmazd has given
sovereignty in heaven to Ardibahi*s*t <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[4](#fn_1153), the archangel, and has spoken thus:
'*As to* every one with whom thou art not pleased, do not let him escape
into heaven.' 6. And this is also declared in revelation, that, every
time that they do not maintain the fire properly, pregnancy becomes
scarcer for the women, fewer male children are born, and honour
(‘hurmat) in the vicinity of the king becomes less for the men, and
*there* is no approbation (qabûl) of *their* words.

7\. *For* every single fire which dies out in a dwelling a loss of three
dirhams and two dângs <span id="fr_1163"></span>[5](#fn_1154) falls

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

on the property of that person, or it becomes the loss of this dwelling,
or it does not reach him from the place whence wealth comes to him.

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[270:3](sbe24099.htm#fr_1157) Or, perhaps,
'the house-fire.'

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[270:4](sbe24099.htm#fr_1158) B29 omits these
four words.

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[271:1](sbe24099.htm#fr_1159) The dînâr is a
gold coin which, if it contained a dirham weight of gold, and if the
dirham were 63 grains (see Dd. LII, 1 n), was equal to about
half-a-sovereign.

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[271:2](sbe24099.htm#fr_1160) One of the three
most sacred fires (see Bd. XVII, 7).

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[271:3](sbe24099.htm#fr_1161) Lp, B29 have 'in
the good religion.'

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[271:4](sbe24099.htm#fr_1162) Av. asha
vahi*s*ta, 'perfect rectitude,' who is supposed to protect, fire (see
Bd. I, 26, Sls. XV, 12).

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[271:5](sbe24099.htm#fr_1163) That is, three
dirhams and a half in silver, or nearly one rupee and a quarter.
