### CHAPTER LXVII.

1\. The sixty-seventh subject is this, that it is necessary for women to
practise great abstinence from committing adultery. 2. For it is
declared in revelation, *as to* every woman who *has* lain with a
strange man, thus: 'What is it necessary to call her, and why is the
explanation <span id="fr_1434"></span>[1](#fn_1423) that she is of one
nature with all wizards and sinners?'

3\. And in the commentary of the Vendîdâ*d* <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[2](#fn_1424) it says '"every woman who consorts
with two strange men is the first *down* upon me, who am Hôrmazd. 4. For
if she takes a look into a river of water it will make *it* diminish, if
she takes a look <span id="fr_1436"></span>[3](#fn_1425) at a tree *or*
shrub the fruit of the trees becomes scanty, and if she speaks a word
with a righteous man it will make the glory <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[4](#fn_1426) of the man diminish." 5. Zaratu*s*t
enquired of Hôrmazd, "What occurs on <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[5](#fn_1427) her account?" 6. The creator Hôrmazd
spoke thus: "It is necessary to kill her sooner than a biting serpent
and similar creatures and wild beasts, because she is more harmful to my
creatures."'

7\. Therefore, since she is like this, it is necessary for women to keep
themselves *with* great effort, so that they *may* not become unlawful
unto their own

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

husbands. 8. For, every time that *one of them* gives herself four times
to another person, she is, after that, unlawful as long as <span
id="fr_1439"></span>[1](#fn_1428) she may be *in* the house of *her*
husband <span id="fr_1440"></span>[2](#fn_1429) and new sin is
increasing *in connection* with her soul <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[3](#fn_1430).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1423"></span>[331:1](sbe24155.htm#fr_1434) B29 has 'and it
is by reason of that fault.'

<span id="fn_1424"></span>[331:2](sbe24155.htm#fr_1435) What follows is
a free paraphrase of Vend. XVIII, 123-132.

<span id="fn_1425"></span>[331:3](sbe24155.htm#fr_1436) Lp omits these
four words.

<span id="fn_1426"></span>[331:4](sbe24155.htm#fr_1437) Lp, B29 add 'and
purity.'

<span id="fn_1427"></span>[331:5](sbe24155.htm#fr_1438) Lp, B29 have
'what is necessary.'

<span id="fn_1428"></span>[332:1](sbe24155.htm#fr_1439) B29 has
'unlawful when.'

<span id="fn_1429"></span>[332:2](sbe24155.htm#fr_1440) This seems to be
the author's interpretation of the following commentary (Pahl. Vend.
XVIII, 124*a*):—'And it is no matter to her; for, when cohabitation is
three times conceded by her, *she is* worthy of death. Gôgô*s*asp said
that this is an adulteress who is *kept* within bounds.'

<span id="fn_1430"></span>[332:3](sbe24155.htm#fr_1441) B29 has
'increasing as to water and fire.'
