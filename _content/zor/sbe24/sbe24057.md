### CHAPTER LI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Wherefore *is it*
when there are *instances* when a lazy, ignorant, and bad man attains to
eminence and great welfare, (3) and there are *instances* when a worthy,
wise, and good man attains to grievous misery, perplexity, and
indigence?'

4\. The spirit of wisdom answered (5) thus: '*As to* him who is a lazy,
ignorant, and bad man, when his destiny becomes a helper, that laziness
of his then becomes like unto diligence, that ignorance unto <span
id="fr_496"></span>[2](#fn_491) knowledge, and that vileness unto <span
id="fr_497"></span>[2](#fn_491) goodness. 6. And *as to* him who is a
wise, worthy, and good man, when his destiny is an opponent, that wisdom
of his then turns to stupidity and foolishness (alakîh), and that
worthiness to ignorance; (7) and *his*

knowledge, skill, and worthiness become manifestly secluded <span
id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_492).'
