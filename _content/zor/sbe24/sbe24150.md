### CHAPTER LXII.

1\. The sixty-second subject is this, that it is necessary to take early
to the speaking of truth and doing of justice, and to maintain oneself
therein, for nothing whatever is better among mankind than truth.

2\. Owing to truth Hôrmazd created this world and that *other* world,
and truth has remained on the spot, and on account of truth it becomes
pure. 3. And the accursed Aharman, *being devoid* of anything good, does
not issue from that which is owing to truth. 4. It is requisite to
occasion the resurrection owing to truth; and, *as to* every place where
truth is not taken up, the glory in that place *has* found a way *out*,
and *as to* every household where much *of this* resides, it is on
account of truth, and Aharman does not find a way into that place.

5\. It is said in revelation that one truthful man is better than a
whole world (’hâlam) speaking falsehood; and Gâvah of Ispahân <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[2](#fn_1388)—when he kept *his* stand upon the
truth, and was speaking words with truth until *the time* when
Dahâk <span id="fr_1400"></span>[3](#fn_1389), who possessed the

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

whole realm, *and* the whole of the demons and mankind have been afraid
of him, through the truth of the words spoken—was bold with them in
every speech, and became victorious (mu*th*affar) over them, by reason
of the true words that he was speaking.

6\. The accursed Aharman, when he perceived the spirit of truth, had
fallen senseless three thousand years <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1](#fn_1390). 7. From fear of truth he never
managed to hold up *his* head, and from fear of truth he did not manage
to come into this world <span id="fr_1402"></span>[2](#fn_1391). 8. And
everything that thou settest *thy* gaze (na*th*ar) *upon* therein, that
has remained on the spot when thou seekest again an examination of it,
has remained through truth. 9. And the interpretation of the
Ashen-vohû <span id="fr_1403"></span>[3](#fn_1392) is in truth, *and*,
for that reason, they recite the Ashem-vohû frequently.
