### CHAPTER XXXIX.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Which power is the
more seemly? 3.. In wisdom who is the more complete? 4. And in
disposition who is the more faithful? 5. Whose speech is the more
proper? 6. In whose mind is the goodness little <span
id="fr_408"></span>[4](#fn_403)? 7. And as a friend who is the worse? 8.
In whose mind is the pleasure little? 9. In heart who is the more
seemly? 10. In endurance who is the more approvable? 11. Who is not to
be considered as faithful? 12. What is that which is worth keeping with
every one? 13. And what

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

is that which is not to be kept with any one? 14. What is to be
preserved in conversation? 15. Who is he that is not to be accepted as a
witness? 16. And unto whom is it necessary to be obedient? 17. What is
it more necessary to mind and to keep praising? 18. What is that which
is not to be made unrespected in any way? 19. What is he who, in his own
degree, is said *to be* such as Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the archangels? 20.
And what is he who, in his own degree, is <span
id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_404) such as Aharman and the demons?'

21\. The spirit of wisdom answered (22) thus: In power he is the more
seemly who, when he indulges his wrath, is able to allay the wrath, and
not commit sin and gratify himself. 23. And in wisdom he is the more
complete who is able to preserve his own soul. 24. In disposition he is
the more faithful, in whom there is nothing whatever *of* deceit and
pretence. 25. The speech of him is the more proper who speaks more true.
26. Goodness is little in the mind of a man of wrath <span
id="fr_410"></span>[2](#fn_405). 27. As a friend, a malicious man who is
a fighter is worse. 28. And pleasure is little in the mind of him who is
an envious man. 29. In heart he is the more seemly who abandons the
worldly *existence* and seizes the spiritual *one;* (30) and by his own
will accepts righteousness as a yoke (va*l* *k*avarman) <span
id="fr_411"></span>[3](#fn_406). 31. And in endurance he is the more
approvable who <span id="fr_412"></span>[4](#fn_407),

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[contentedly and
with a will, accepts, as a yoke <span id="fr_413"></span>[1](#fn_408),\]
the misery and affliction which \[come upon\] him \[from Aharman and the
demons and the vile; (32) *and* it, in no way, harasses his own soul.
33. He is not to be considered as faithful who has no fear of the sacred
beings, *nor* shame as to mankind. 34. Those which are worth keeping
with every one are peace and affection. 35. And those which are not to
be kept with any one whatever are malice *and* discord. 36. All <span
id="fr_414"></span>[2](#fn_409) these three are to be preserved in
conversation: good thoughts, good words, *and* good deeds in one's own
thinking, speaking, *and* doing. 37. These three are not to be accepted
as a witness: a woman <span id="fr_415"></span>[3](#fn_410), a young
serving-boy <span id="fr_416"></span>[4](#fn_411), and a man-slave. 38.
These are such as must be personally obedient *and* do service: (39) the
wife unto the husband, (40) and the child unto the father and mother,
the chieftain <span id="fr_417"></span>[5](#fn_412) and high-priest, the
teacher <span id="fr_418"></span>[6](#fn_413), the adopted son <span
id="fr_419"></span>[7](#fn_414), and secluded <span
id="fr_420"></span>[8](#fn_415) kindred. 41. *And* unto rulers,
chieftains, *and* teachers *one* is also to be obedient. 42. The sacred
beings it is more necessary to mind and to keep praising. 43. And one's
own soul is not to be made <span id="fr_421"></span>[9](#fn_416)
unrespected in any mode, (44) *and* is always to be kept

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

in remembrance. 45. The judge who exercises true justice, *and* takes no
bribe, is <span id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_417), in his own degree, such
as Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the archangels. 46. And he who exercises false
justice is said *to be*, in his own degree, such as Aharman and the
demons.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_403"></span>[76:4](sbe24045.htm#fr_408) L19 has 'much the
more,' to correspond with a different reps in § 26.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[77:1](sbe24045.htm#fr_409) L19 has 'is said
*to be*.'

<span id="fn_405"></span>[77:2](sbe24045.htm#fr_410) L19 has 'goodness
is more in an humble-minded man,' so as to correspond with the
difference in its question in § 6.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[77:3](sbe24045.htm#fr_411) Literally, 'for the
neck.' Nêr. has misread va*l*-i*k* valman (Pâz. ô-*k*a ôi), and has 'by
his own will for it, also accepts righteousness.'

<span id="fn_407"></span>[77:4](sbe24045.htm#fr_412) From this point to
Chap. XL, 17, the Pahlavi text of K43 is missing, owing to the loss of
one folio in that MS. The copy of <span id="page_78">p. 78</span> TD2
is, therefore, followed, and its translation is enclosed in brackets.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[78:1](sbe24045.htm#fr_413) See § 30 n.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[78:2](sbe24045.htm#fr_414) L19 omits 'all.'

<span id="fn_410"></span>[78:3](sbe24045.htm#fr_415) Or 'a wife,' as
both meanings are expressed by the same word, and, in fact, every woman
is expected to become a wife.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[78:4](sbe24045.htm#fr_416) L19 has 'a young
boy,' as in Chap. XXIX, 4.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[78:5](sbe24045.htm#fr_417) The word sa*r*dâr
(Pâz. sâlâr) also means 'guardian.'

<span id="fn_413"></span>[78:6](sbe24045.htm#fr_418) L19 inserts 'and
fire.'

<span id="fn_414"></span>[78:7](sbe24045.htm#fr_419) See Chap. XXXVI, 8
n. As the adopted son takes the place of the deceased father, he must be
obeyed accordingly by the whole family.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[78:8](sbe24045.htm#fr_420) See Chap. XV, 6 n.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[78:9](sbe24045.htm#fr_421) L19 has
'considered.'

<span id="fn_417"></span>[79:1](sbe24045.htm#fr_422) L19 has 'is said
*to be*.'
