### CHAPTER IX.

1\. The ninth subject is this, that it is necessary to practise
abstinence from committing *or* permitting unnatural intercourse <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[3](#fn_1133). 2. For this is the chief of all sins
*in* the religion: there is no worse sin than this in the good religion,
and it is proper to call those *who commit it* worthy of death in
reality.

3\. If any one comes forth to them, and shall see them in the act, *and*
is working with an axe <span id="fr_1142"></span>[4](#fn_1134), it is
requisite *for him* to cut *off* the heads or to rip up the bellies of
both, *and* it is no sin for him. 4. *But* it is not proper to kill any
person without the authority of high-priests and kings, except on
account of committing *or* permitting unnatural intercourse.

5\. For it says in revelation that unnatural intercourse is on a par
with Aharman, with Afrâsiyâb <span id="fr_1143"></span>[5](#fn_1135),
with Dahâk <span id="fr_1144"></span>[5](#fn_1135), with Tûr-i
Brâ*d*ar-vakhṣh <span id="fr_1145"></span>[6](#fn_1136) who slew

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Zaratu*s*t, with
Malkôs <span id="fr_1146"></span>[1](#fn_1137) who will arise, with the
serpent Sruvar which existed in the days of Sâm Narîmân <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[2](#fn_1138), and as many sins as are theirs. 6.
And Aharman, the evil *one*, becomes more joyful, owing to this
practice, than owing to the other sins *which* have made high-priests
necessary <span id="fr_1148"></span>[3](#fn_1139); for the soul itself
of that person becomes extinct.

7\. And when they commit *the sin* with women, it is just the same as
that with men.
