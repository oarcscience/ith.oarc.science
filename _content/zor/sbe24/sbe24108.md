### CHAPTER XX.

1\. The twentieth subject is this, that it is incumbent on those of the
good religion that they continually give something to the worthy to eat,
on account (*g*ihat) of that which it says in revelation <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[3](#fn_1203) thus: 'When thou givest things to some
one that he *may* eat, every duty and good work that he performs in that
*state of* repletion become *those* of that person, who has given that
bread or food to him, just like those which he has performed with his
own hand.' 2. And if he commits a sin, he who may have given food to him
is innocent. 3. But it is necessary that he be of the good religion and
worthy; they *should* give something to *one of* a different religion
only in case of extreme necessity (ʓ̣arûrat), lest it become as a sin.
