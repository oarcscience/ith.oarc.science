### CHAPTER XXXI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'What is the business
of the priests, warriors, and husbandmen <span
id="fr_365"></span>[5](#fn_360), each separately?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'The business of the priests
is to maintain the religion properly; (5) and to perform the ceremonial
and invocation of the sacred beings well *and* with attention,

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (6) and <span
id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_361) the decrees, decisions <span
id="fr_367"></span>[2](#fn_362), custom, and control <span
id="fr_368"></span>[3](#fn_363), as revealed by the pure, good religion
of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers. 7. To make people aware of the goodness of
good works <span id="fr_369"></span>[4](#fn_364); (8) and to show the
way to heaven, and the danger and avoidance of hell.

9\. 'The business of the warriors is to defeat the enemy; (10) and to
keep their own country and land (bûm) <span
id="fr_370"></span>[5](#fn_365) unalarmed and tranquil.

11\. 'And the business of the husbandmen is to perform tillage and
cultivation; (12) and, to the extent of *their* ability, to keep the
world invigorated and populous.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_360"></span>[67:5](sbe24037.htm#fr_365) The three classes
which are often mentioned in the Avesta as constituting the
Ma*zd*a-worshipping community. For their vices, see Chap. LIX.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[68:1](sbe24037.htm#fr_366) L19 inserts 'to
keep true.'

<span id="fn_362"></span>[68:2](sbe24037.htm#fr_367) K43 has dâ*d*
dâ*d*istân, 'decisions of the law;' but the repetition of the syllable
dâ*d* is probably a clerical blunder.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[68:3](sbe24037.htm#fr_368) L19 omits va band,
'and control.'

<span id="fn_364"></span>[68:4](sbe24037.htm#fr_369) L19 has 'aware of
good works and sin.'

<span id="fn_365"></span>[68:5](sbe24037.htm#fr_370) L19 has vîma*n*d,
'frontier.'
