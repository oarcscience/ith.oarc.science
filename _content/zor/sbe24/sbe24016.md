### CHAPTER X.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Can *there* be any
peace and affection whatever of Aharman, the wicked, and his demons and
miscreations, with Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the archangels, one with the other,
or not?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: '*There* cannot be, on any
account whatever; (5) because Aharman meditates evil falsehood and its
deeds, wrath and malice and discord, (6) and Aûha*r*ma*zd* meditates
righteousness and its deeds, good works

and goodness and truth. 7. And everything can change, except good and
bad nature. 8. A good nature cannot change to evil by any means
whatever, and a bad nature to goodness in any manner. 9. Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
on account of a good nature, approves no evil and falsehood; (10) and
Aharman, on account of a bad nature, accepts no goodness and truth; (11)
and, on this account, *there* cannot be for them any peace and affection
whatever, one with the other.'
