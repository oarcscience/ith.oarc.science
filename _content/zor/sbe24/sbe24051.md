### CHAPTER XLV.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'By what does Aharman
most deceive and lead people to hell? 3. And from what is his pleasure
most? 4. Where is the place he has a foundation?

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 5. Where, also, is
his coming, *together* with the demons, most? 6. And from what is his
food?'

7\. The spirit of wisdom answered (8) thus: Aharman deceives people most
by prosperity and adversity <span id="fr_470"></span>[1](#fn_465), the
fiend of apostasy, scepticism, and covetousness. 9. His pleasure, also,
is most from the discord of men. 10. And his food is from the
impenitence <span id="fr_471"></span>[2](#fn_466) and reticence of men.
11. He has a foundation in the malicious <span
id="fr_472"></span>[3](#fn_467). 12. And his coming and going are most
with the wrathful.'
