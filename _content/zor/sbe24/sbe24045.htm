<p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Which power is the more seemly? 3.. In wisdom who is the more complete? 4. And in disposition who is the more faithful? 5. Whose speech is the more proper? 6. In whose mind is the goodness little&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_408"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>? 7. And as a friend who is the worse? 8. In whose mind is the pleasure little? 9. In heart who is the more seemly? 10. In endurance who is the more approvable? 11. Who is not to be considered as faithful? 12. What is that which is worth keeping with every one? 13. And what</p>

<p>is that which is not to be kept with any one? 14. What is to be preserved in conversation? 15. Who is he that is not to be accepted as a witness? 16. And unto whom is it necessary to be obedient? 17. What is it more necessary to mind and to keep praising? 18. What is that which is not to be made unrespected in any way? 19. What is he who, in his own degree, is said <I>to be</I> such as A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> and the archangels? 20. And what is he who, in his own degree, is&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_409"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> such as Aharman and the demons?'</p>  
<p>21. The spirit of wisdom answered (22) thus: In power he is the more seemly who, when he indulges his wrath, is able to allay the wrath, and not commit sin and gratify himself. 23. And in wisdom he is the more complete who is able to preserve his own soul. 24. In disposition he is the more faithful, in whom there is nothing whatever <I>of</I> deceit and pretence. 25. The speech of him is the more proper who speaks more true. 26. Goodness is little in the mind of a man of wrath&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_410"></A><A HREF="#fn_405"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 27. As a friend, a malicious man who is a fighter is worse. 28. And pleasure is little in the mind of him who is an envious man. 29. In heart he is the more seemly who abandons the worldly <I>existence</I> and seizes the spiritual <I>one;</I> (30) and by his own will accepts righteousness as a yoke (va<I>l</I> <I>k</I>avarman)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_411"></A><A HREF="#fn_406"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 31.

He is not to be considered as faithful who has no fear of the sacred beings, <I>nor</I> shame as to mankind. 34. Those which are worth keeping with every one are peace and affection. 35. And those which are not to be kept with any one whatever are malice <I>and</I> discord. 36. All&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_414"></A><A HREF="#fn_409"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> these three are to be preserved in conversation: good thoughts, good words, <I>and</I> good deeds in one's own thinking, speaking, <I>and</I> doing. 37.
