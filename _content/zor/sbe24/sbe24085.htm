<p>1. Another <I>thing</I> I publish is a feeble story (nisang) about the inconsistency, unbounded statements, and incoherent disputations of Christian (Tars&acirc;k) believers.</p>  
<p>2. Since, inasmuch as all three&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1004"></A><A HREF="#fn_996"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are from the one origin of Judaism&#151;(3) that <I>implying that</I>, when <I>anything</I> is said within the one, it is for them mutually helping their own delusion of every kind&#151;(4) you should know whence the original sect of Christianity came forth. 5. That in the town of Jerusalem&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1005"></A><A HREF="#fn_997"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>there</I> was a woman of the same Jews who was known for incapacity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1006"></A><A HREF="#fn_998"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, (6) <I>and</I> pregnancy became manifest in her&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1007"></A><A HREF="#fn_999"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 7. When asked by them thus: 'Whence is this pregnancy of thine?' (8) she said in reply thus: 'The angel Gabriel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1008"></A><A HREF="#fn_1000"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> came unto me, and he spoke thus: "Thou art pregnant by the pure wind (holy spirit)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1009"></A><A HREF="#fn_1001"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>."'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_230"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 230</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. <I>As to</I> that, you should observe thus: 'Who, apart from that woman, saw the angel Gabriel? <I>And</I> on what account is it expedient to consider that woman truthful?' 10. If they say that, on account of the spiritual state of that angel, no one is able to see <I>him</I>, (11) that <I>implies</I>&#151;if the cause of not seeing that angel be <I>his</I> spiritual nature&#151;<I>that</I> the sight of that woman also, for the same reason, is not unrestricted. 12. If they say that the sacred being made <I>him</I> visible to that woman, and on account of the worthiness of that woman, (13) no other person <I>being</I> made worthy, (14) <I>observe</I> this, where is the evidence that the woman spoke truthfully? 15. Or, if that woman were conspicuous to <I>any</I> one for truth, it is fitting for him to demonstrate that also to other persons, so that, through that evidence, she might be more fully considered as very truthful by them. 16. <I>But</I> now the showing of him (the angel), to that woman only; is not considered <I>by</I> any one as true. 17. Now you should also observe <I>that</I> the origin of their religion <I>has</I> all come forth from this testimony of a woman, which <I>was</I> given by her about her own <I>condition</I>.</p>  
<p>18.<I></I> Observe, again, that if they say the Messiah arose from the pure wind of the sacred being, that <I>implies</I>&#151;if the only wind that is pure <I>and</I> from the sacred being be that one&#151;that the other wind, which is distinct from that, is not <I>from</I> the sacred being and not pure, (19) <I>and</I> another producer is manifested inevitably. 20. If the wind be all from</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_231"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 231</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the sacred being and sacred, it ought to be all pure. 21. If only that one wind be pure, the other wind is polluted and not sacred. 22. As there is no producer whatever except the sacred being, that pollution and impurity of the other wind are likewise from the sacred. being. 23. And if the other wind be that of the sacred being and sacred, it ought to be all pure. 24. Now, that one <I>being</I> considered as purity, why was the other polluted?</p>  
<p>25. Again, <I>observe</I> this, that, if the Messiah were the son of the sacred being for the reason that the sacred being is the father of all, through productiveness, creativeness, and cherishing, (26) that Messiah, through sonship to the sacred being, is not otherwise than the meaner creatures which the sacred being produced and created. 27. If he were born through the means of male and female, (28) that <I>implies</I>&#151;if birth through male and female be suitable unto the sacred being&#151;<I>that</I> it is also <I>so</I> unto the archangels <I>and</I> spirits; <I>in</I> like manner, on account of the existence of birth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1010"></A><A HREF="#fn_1002"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the occurrence of death also is suitable. 29. Thus, about the arising of <I>that</I> same sacred being <I>there</I> is no doubt, (30) because there where birth of that kind <I>exists</I>, eating, drinking, <I>and</I> even death are certain.</p>  
<p>31. And, there are <I>some</I> even who say that the Messiah is the sacred being himself. 32. Now this is very strange, when the mighty sacred being, the maintainer <I>and</I> cherisher of the two existences, became of human nature, <I>and</I> went into the womb of a woman who <I>was</I> a Jew. 33. To leave the lordly throne, the sky <I>and</I> earth, the <I>celestial</I> sphere</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_232"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 232</FONT></A></p>  
<p><I>and</I> other similar <I>objects</I> of <I>his</I> management and protection, he fell (a&ucirc;past), for concealment, into a polluted and straitened&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1011"></A><A HREF="#fn_1003"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> place, (34) and, finally, delivered his own body to scourging, execution on the tree (d&acirc;r-kar<I>d</I>&icirc;h), and the hands of enemies, (35) while, apart from death, much brutality <I>and</I> lawlessness <I>were</I> arranged by them.</p>  
<p>36. If they speak of his <I>having</I> been inside the womb of a woman for the reason that the sacred being exists <I>in</I> every place, (37) that <I>implies that being</I> inside the womb of a woman, through existence <I>in</I> every place, is not more antagonistic than <I>being in any</I> very polluted and very fetid place; (38) <I>and, along</I> with that, that the faultiness of speaking of all places <I>as having</I> been the property of the sacred being is manifold, (39) because, if <I>they were so, in</I> like manner the speaking of anything whatever that is devoid of the existence of the sacred being is strange&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1012"></A><A HREF="#fn_1004"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>40. Again, <I>as to</I> that which they say, that death and execution on the tree <I>were</I> accepted by him, as a yoke&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1013"></A><A HREF="#fn_1005"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, for the sake of demonstrating the resurrection to mankind, (41) that <I>implies</I>&#151;if it were not possible for him to <A HREF="errata.htm#4">demonstrate</A> the resurrection to mankind, except through that disgrace&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1014"></A><A HREF="#fn_1006"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and death and brutal treatment of himself&#151;<I>that</I> that omnipotence of his is not effectual. 42. Or, when no opponent and adversary whatever of his arose, why</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_233"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 233</FONT></A></p>  
<p>are they not made without doubt of that sort of clear knowledge which is <I>imparted</I> by seeing the resurrection, so that <I>there</I> would not have been a necessity for this mode of demonstrating it brutally, disgracefully&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1015"></A><A HREF="#fn_1007"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, distressingly, <I>and</I> through the will of <I>his</I> enemies. 43. If that death <I>were</I> accepted by him; as a yoke of a new description, through his own will, (44) that <I>implies that</I> now his outcry of woe and curses for the executioners&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1016"></A><A HREF="#fn_1008"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>and his</I> considering those Jews as <I>it were</I> wrathfully are unreasonable. 45. <I>He ought</I>, indeed, not to cause curses and <I>imprecations of</I> woe upon them, but it is fitting for them to be worthy of recompense through that deed.</p>  
<p>46. Again, <I>as to</I> this which they state, that the father and son and pure wind are three names which are not separate one from the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1017"></A><A HREF="#fn_1009"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, (47) nor is one foremost, (48) <I>and</I> this, too, that, though a son, <I>he</I> is not less than the father, <I>but in</I> every knowledge equal <I>to</I> the father&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1018"></A><A HREF="#fn_1010"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, why now is <I>one</I> to call him by a different name? 49. If it be proper <I>for</I> three to be one, that <I>implies that</I> it is certainly possible <I>for</I> three to be nine and <I>for</I> nine to be</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_234"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 234</FONT></A></p>  
<p>three; (50) <I>and</I> it is possible to speak <I>of</I> other numbers, in this sequence, unlimitedly.</p>  
<p>51. <I>Observe</I> this, too, that if a son <I>be</I> not less than a father, that father also is not greater than the son. 52. That is possible if the father is said <I>to be</I> from the son, or the son not from the father. 53. And this is certain, that it is possible <I>for</I> every one <I>originating</I> from <I>any</I> one to be less than him from&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1019"></A><A HREF="#fn_1011"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> whom he is, who is the essential origin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1020"></A><A HREF="#fn_1012"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of himself; (54) if <I>he be so</I> in <I>point of</I> time, <I>and</I> likewise if <I>so</I> in <I>point of</I> relationship. 55. If the son <I>be</I> not less than the father, that <I>implies that</I> the maker is not before the <I>thing</I> made, nor yet is greater; (56) both must be original evolutions, (57) and the creation is not less than the creator, nor the creator greater than the creation, (58) however he <I>may</I> be said <I>to be</I> unlimited.</p>  
<p>59. <I>Observe</I> this, too, that if the son <I>be</I> equal to the father in all knowledge, that father also is as ignorant as the son who was unaware of his own death and execution on the tree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1021"></A><A HREF="#fn_1013"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, (60) until <I>he was</I> slain by their capturing <I>him</I> and causing <I>his</I> wretched death, brutal treatment, <I>and</I> disgrace&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1022"></A><A HREF="#fn_1014"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 61. He did not know about it because they enquired of him thus: 'When is the day of resurrection?' And he answered thus: 'Of this no one is aware but the father&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1023"></A><A HREF="#fn_1015"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.' 62. Just as when the son is formed (t&acirc;<I>s</I>t&icirc;k)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_235"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 235</FONT></A></p>  
<p>as <I>it were</I> ignorant, the father <I>must be</I> as <I>it were</I> just the same.</p>  
<p>63. <I>Observe</I> this, too, that all the creatures and creation, <I>and</I> even his own adversary, being created and produced by him out of nothing, the executioners of his son are themselves deluded <I>by him</I>. 64. <I>And</I> if the sacred being himself created the executioners of his son, <I>and</I> even his own adversary, without a purpose <I>and</I> without a cause, (65) and the son <I>was</I> slain by them altogether with, his knowledge, (66) that <I>implies that</I> it is now possible to be without doubt that the slayer of his son was he himself, (67) if he knew that when he produces&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1024"></A><A HREF="#fn_1016"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a son they <I>will</I> then slay him, and <I>in</I> the end he produced <I>him</I> foolishly and unwisely. 68. If he did not know <I>it, he</I> is deficient in knowledge.</p>  
<p>69. Again, <I>observe</I> this, that, if the sacred being created these creatures and creation out of nothing, and created and produced even his adversary similarly out of nothing, that <I>implies that</I> their nature ought to be one. 70. Now, why is not the adversary preserved <I>in</I> the <I>same</I> manner as the other creatures?</p>  
<p>71. Another <I>point</I> is about the inconsistency of the statements <I>derived</I> from the scriptures of their high-priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1025"></A><A HREF="#fn_1017"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (72) and that which he says that no <I>one</I> falls, nor anything from a tree, and no outcry arises in a district&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1026"></A><A HREF="#fn_1018"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, nor two birds fight together</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A></p>  
<p>without the command of the father&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1027"></A><A HREF="#fn_1019"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, (73) which is a demonstration&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1028"></A><A HREF="#fn_1020"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of these statements, that the original evolution is single and all <I>things</I> are by his will.</p>  
<p>74. Now for what purpose <I>was</I> the Messiah appointed, who is his son; and which way is the demonstration, through that, of his (the father's) <I>being</I> unwilling; (75) when all is <I>by</I> his will, and nothing whatever is said <I>about</I> his <I>being</I> unwilling? 76. Even this is <I>evident</I> from the same explanation, that the Jews slew the Messiah, who is his son, through the will of the father.</p>  
<p>77. Again, he speaks inconsistently about the free will (&acirc;<I>z</I>&acirc;<I>d</I>-k&acirc;m&icirc;h) of the faithful, (78) that mankind are produced by him <I>with</I> free will. 79. Thus the iniquity of the sin which mankind commit is freely willed, (80) and the freedom of will <I>was</I> produced by him himself for mankind. 81. That <I>implies that</I> it is fitting to consider him likewise a sinner who is the original cause of sin. 82. If mankind commit sin and crime by their own free will through. the will of the sacred being, (83) through what free will and sin are the sin and crime of the lion, serpent, wolf, <I>and</I> scorpion&#151;the stinging <I>and</I> slaying noxious creatures&#151;which are the natural actions that ever proceed from them?</p>  
<p>84. So also, who <I>has</I> maintained the origin of the deadly poison which is in the B&ecirc;sh <I>herb</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1029"></A><A HREF="#fn_1021"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and other species of plants, the cause of which is not owing to free will? 85: If they say that those poisons</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A></p>  
<p>are advantageous <I>and</I> suitable in many medicines which are removers of the disease of the sick, (86) it should be asked of them thus: 'Who produced the disease itself and the harm that <I>arises</I> from it, and what is the necessity of it, (87) that, afterwards, medicine and deadly poison <I>were</I> created by him for it; and were necessary?' 88. Or, <I>as to</I> that disease, 'it would be more expedient if he had produced an antidotal (an&ocirc;sh) medicine for carrying <I>it</I> away than a medicine of poison.' 89. Also this, that is, 'from what origin is the term itself "doing harm," and against whom is the advantageousness necessary?' 90. On this subject it is possible to speak abundantly for a summary compiled.</p>  
<p>91. Another <I>instance</I> is from the words of Paul (P&acirc;var&ocirc;<I>s</I>), who <I>was</I> their high-priest&#151;(92) that <I>one</I> who was afflictive with&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1030"></A><A HREF="#fn_1022"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> them at their own beginning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1031"></A><A HREF="#fn_1023"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>&#151;even this, they say, (93) is thus: 'Not the good works which I desire, but the iniquity (94) which I do not desire, I do&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1032"></A><A HREF="#fn_1024"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 95. And <I>it</I> is not I <I>that</I> do <I>so</I>, but that which is collected within me does <I>it</I>, (96) because I always see that <I>it</I> is striving with me day and night&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1033"></A><A HREF="#fn_1025"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>97. Again, they say, from the words of the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_238"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 238</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Messiah, that the original evolution <I>from</I> the sacred being is light and goodness; (98) evil and darkness are separate from him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1034"></A><A HREF="#fn_1026"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 99. Also this, that is, 'just as a shepherd who provides protection for his hundred sheep, (100) <I>and</I> the wolves carry <I>off</I> one from him, (101) goes after that one which the wolves carried <I>off</I> until he leads it back to the flock, (102) and leaves the ninety-nine of them in the wilderness (da<I>s</I>t)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1035"></A><A HREF="#fn_1027"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (103) even so I am come to take care of the defiled, not for the just, (104) because <I>it</I> is needless to bring him who is just into the <I>right</I> way&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1036"></A><A HREF="#fn_1028"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.' 105. That <I>implies</I>, if the original evolution <I>be</I> one, and his will <I>be</I> wholly <I>that</I> no one whatever of it <I>shall be</I> astray and defiled, (106) <I>that</I> even the wolf's slaying the sheep is likewise his will, (107) and the wolf itself <I>was</I> also created by him.</p>  
<p>108. The word of the Messiah is specially inconsistently a demonstrator as regards the two original evolutions. 109. As they say this is one of <I>those</I> same statements of the Messiah, that there is another original evolution, 'an enemy of my father, <I>and</I> I am of that sacred being doing good works&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1037"></A><A HREF="#fn_1029"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.' 110. From this statement <I>it</I> is evident that his own father separates from that enemy, <I>and</I> acts differently.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_239"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 239</FONT></A></p>  
<p>111. This, too, <I>he says</I>, that is, 'I am produced <I>by</I> the sacred being for truth and through truth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1038"></A><A HREF="#fn_1030"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; (112) and Aharman, the iniquitous, came for my death (va<I>d</I>ar<I>d</I>an&#335;), (113) and I am desired by him to deceive in many ways&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1039"></A><A HREF="#fn_1031"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' 114. Now, if the original evolution <I>be</I> one, and there be nothing competing with it, why <I>was</I> Aharman so powerful that he desired to delude the son of the sacred being? 115. If the sacred being himself created that iniquitous <I>one</I>, then the producing of that delusion by the <I>latter was</I> with the knowledge and will of <I>the former</I> himself, (116) and the deluder of the son <I>was</I> in like manner himself.</p>  
<p>117. This, too, it says, that, when the Jews stood disputing against <I>him</I>, he spoke to the Jews thus: 'You are from that which is a lower <I>region</I>, and I am from an upper <I>region</I>; (118) you are of this country, I am not of it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1040"></A><A HREF="#fn_1032"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.' 119. And he also said this, that is, 'I know that you are of the seed of Abraham, <I>and</I> he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1041"></A><A HREF="#fn_1033"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> who had slain mankind from aforetime (120) <I>has</I> wished to slay even me. 121. I do that which is seen of my father, <I>and</I> you do that which is seen by you as to your own father&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1042"></A><A HREF="#fn_1034"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.' 122. This,</p>

<p><A NAME="page_240"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 240</FONT></A></p>  
<p>too, <I>he said</I>, 'If the sacred being be that father of yours, he would be a friend of me <I>for</I> your <I>sake</I>, (123) because I have sprung from the sacred being; I have not come of my own will; (124) I am appointed <I>by</I> that sacred being doing good works&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1043"></A><A HREF="#fn_1035"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Why do you not hear those words of mine? 125. Only because you are from the iniquitous <I>one it</I> is not possible for you to hear them, (126) and you wish to do the will of your own father. 127. By him truth is not spoken; whatever he speaks he tells a lie of it, therefore you are false yourselves <I>together</I> with your father. 128. <I>As for</I> me, who speak the truth, you do not believe it of me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1044"></A><A HREF="#fn_1036"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: 129. And he who is from the sacred being hears the words of the sacred being, but you, because you are not from the sacred being, do not hear my words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1045"></A><A HREF="#fn_1037"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.' 130. By all these sayings it is demonstrated by him that there are two original evolutions, 'one by which I am produced, <I>and</I> one by which the Jews <I>are</I>,' (131) and that <I>latter</I> is not his doer of good works, but is called by him the iniquitous <I>one</I>. . .</p>  
<p>132. And this, too, <I>was</I> said by him, that 'not</p>

<p>unrestricted (atang) is the tree of merit (kirfak) to produce the fruit of offensiveness (ba<I>z</I>ak), nor yet that of offensiveness <I>as to</I> the fruit of merit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1046"></A><A HREF="#fn_1038"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' 133. This, too, <I>he said</I>, that 'he either makes the whole tree with fruit of merit, or the whole tree with fruit of offensiveness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1047"></A><A HREF="#fn_1039"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (134) for every tree becomes manifest by <I>its</I> fruit, if <I>it be of</I> merit and <I>if it be of</I> offensivenes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1048"></A><A HREF="#fn_1040"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.' 135. And the whole tree <I>was</I> mentioned by him, not half the tree. 136. Now, how is it suitable <I>for</I> half a tree <I>to be</I> light and half dark, (137) half merit and half offensiveness, (138) half truth and half falsehood? 139. When these remain both competing together, (140) they cannot become one tree.</p>  
<p>141. And, again, a Jewish <I>sect was</I> called by him 'the hill-serpent of the Jews&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1049"></A><A HREF="#fn_1041"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>,' (142) and he spoke thus: 'How is <I>it</I> possible for you to do good works when you are Jewish evil-doers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1050"></A><A HREF="#fn_1042"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>?' 143. And <I>it was</I> not his own father he called an evil-doer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1051"></A><A HREF="#fn_1043"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_242"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 242</FONT></A></p>  
<p>144. This, too, he says, that 'every tree which the father <I>has</I> not sown should be dug <I>up</I>, and should be cast into the fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1052"></A><A HREF="#fn_1044"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' 145. Wherefore it is fitting to understand from these words that there is a tree, which the father <I>has</I> not sown; <I>that</I> it is necessary to dig <I>up and</I> cast <I>away</I>.</p>  
<p>146. Again, <I>he says</I> this, that 'I am come to my own, and I am not received <I>by</I> my own&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1053"></A><A HREF="#fn_1045"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' 147. Wherefore it is fitting to understand that <I>what is</I> his own and <I>what is</I> not his own are two <I>things</I>.</p>  
<p>148. This, too, he says, that is, 'Our father, that <I>art</I> in the sky, let thy empire arise! And may it be thy will <I>that</I> shall take place on earth as in the sky! 149. Also give us daily bread! And do not bring us to a cause of doubt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1054"></A><A HREF="#fn_1046"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!' 150. From these words <I>it</I> is evident that his will is not so unalloyed (a<I>v</I>&ecirc;<I>z</I>ak) on earth as in the sky. 151. Also this, that the cause of the doubt of mankind is not owing to the sacred being.</p>  
<p>152. And this, too, <I>was</I> said by him at first, that I am not come for the <I>purpose</I> that I <I>may</I> destroy the law of Moses (M&ucirc;sh&acirc;&ecirc;), (153) but I am come for the <I>purpose</I> that I <I>may</I> make <I>it</I> altogether more complete&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1055"></A><A HREF="#fn_1047"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.' 154. And <I>yet</I> all his sayings and</p>
