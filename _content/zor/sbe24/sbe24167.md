### CHAPTER LXXIX.

1\. The seventy-ninth subject is this, that it is necessary to make an
effort that they *may* exercise munificence and liberality towards the
good and the worthy. 2. For the exercise of liberality is grand, *in*
such manner as it is better and pleasanter, *in* like manner, for the
ground on which a liberal man walks, better for the wind that blows upon
a liberal man, better for the horse on which a liberal man sits, better,
*in* like manner, for the cow and goat that <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[2](#fn_1486) a liberal man eats, *and* <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[3](#fn_1487) pleasanter for the sun and moon and
stars that shine upon a liberal man.

3\. To such an extent is a liberal and munificent *man* precious
(’hazîz), that Hôrmazd speaks <span id="fr_1499"></span>[4](#fn_1488)
thus: 'I have wished that I *might* give a recompense *to* a munificent
man, if it be suitable for him, *but* I have not found any recompense
and happiness that are suitable for him, except a blessing.' 4. And
virtuous men and the united archangels are perpetually uttering
blessings on account of the liberal man who maintains no refusal of his
own things to a stranger.

5\. For it is declared in revelation, that the creator Hôrmazd spoke to
Zaratu*s*t, the Spitamân, thus: 'I have created the supreme heaven of
heavens for the sake of any of the liberal who provide for the worthy
and give them something; and gloomy hell is for all those persons who
give anything to the unworthy.'

6\. *In* like manner it is declared in revelation, that there are
thirty-three ways to heaven, besides *that of* the souls of the liberal.
7. If the soul be of any one else, it is not able to arrive in
heaven <span id="fr_1500"></span>[1](#fn_1489) by that way. 8. Besides
*this* happy <span id="fr_1501"></span>[2](#fn_1490) way, a soul of the
liberal is able to arrive in heaven by means of the thirty-three ways.
9. For no one is it easier to arrive in heaven than *for* the liberal.
