<p>1. The twentieth subject is this, that it is incumbent on those of the good religion that they continually give something to the worthy to eat, on account (<I>g</I>ihat) of that which it says in revelation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1212"></A><A HREF="#fn_1203"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> thus: 'When thou givest things to some one that he <I>may</I> eat, every duty and good work that he performs in that <I>state of</I> repletion become <I>those</I> of that person, who has given that bread or food to him, just like those which he has performed with his own hand.' 2. And if he commits a sin, he who may have given food to him is innocent. 3. But it is necessary that he be of the good religion and worthy; they <I>should</I> give something to <I>one of</I> a different religion only in case of extreme necessity (&#659;&#803;ar&ucirc;rat), lest it become as a sin.</p>
