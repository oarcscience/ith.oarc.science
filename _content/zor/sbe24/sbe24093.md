### CHAPTER V.

1\. The fifth subject is this, that it is necessary for all those of the
good religion that they make a thorough effort, so that they celebrate
the ritual and become Navazû*d* <span id="fr_1109"></span>[1](#fn_1101).

2\. For in our religion there is no good work more ample than this. 3.
And it is declared in revelation, that, although much duty and good work
be performed, it s not possible to attain to the supreme heaven
(garô*d*mân) <span id="fr_1110"></span>[2](#fn_1102), except *on* that
one occasion when the Navazû*d* *ceremony* is performed, or they have
celebrated a Gêtî-kharî*d* <span id="fr_1111"></span>[3](#fn_1103). 4.
And *on* any occasion (‘hâl), if they are not able to perform *it* with
their own hands, it is requisite to order *it; and* then it is
inevitably necessary that the celebration of <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[4](#fn_1104) the Gêtî-kharî*d* should be *in* the
same manner as they *would* have performed *it* with their own hands.

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

5\. Man and woman are both <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1](#fn_1105) equal
in this good work; therefore <span id="fr_1114"></span>[2](#fn_1106), it
is not proper to neglect this duty, for it is the chief of all the good
works of the religion. 6. Because it is declared in revelation, that on
the day that they are performing the Navazû*d* *ceremony*, or are
celebrating a Gêtî-kharî*d* on his account, three times the soul of that
person arrives at heaven, and they show it a place therein, and offer it
a profuse greeting (niTHâr) <span id="fr_1115"></span>[3](#fn_1107).

7\. The explanation (tafsîr) of the Gâhs <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[4](#fn_1108) is this, that a Gâh—that is, that his
own place—becomes visible to him <span id="fr_1117"></span>[5](#fn_1109)
in heaven that day.

8\. And if *one* does not perform a Navazû*d* *ceremony*, or does not
order the celebration of a Gêtî-kharî*d*, it is the same as when a poor
(*gh*arîb) man makes *for* <span id="fr_1118"></span>[6](#fn_1110) a
town, and does not obtain a spot where he *may* alight *in* that place.
9. Although it is his own town he is in this trouble. 10. Therefore, it
is not possible to bring to hand a place in heaven through any good
work, except by the performance of the Navazû*d* ceremony, or *by*
ordering the celebration of a Gêtî-kharî*d*.

11\. And a Gêtî-kharî*d* is this, that heaven is purchased in the world,
and one's own place brought to hand in heaven.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1101"></span>[262:1](sbe24093.htm#fr_1109) Apparently
'newly born' (see Sls. XIII, 2 n), a term applied to one who has been
duly initiated. After preparatory performances of the Bareshnûm
purification and the ordinary ceremonial, the ceremonies are carried on
four days longer by two priests. The first day's ceremony is that of the
Nônâbar, the second is the Srôsh ya*s*t, the third is the Sîrôzah, and
the fourth is the Vispara*d* (see Vi*g*irkar*d* î Dînik, ed. Peshotan,
p. 147).

<span id="fn_1102"></span>[262:2](sbe24093.htm#fr_1110) Ordinary good
works, when in excess of the sins, are a passport only to the ordinary
heaven (vahi*s*t).

<span id="fn_1103"></span>[262:3](sbe24093.htm#fr_1111) Literally
'purchased *in* the worldly *existence*' (see § 11). A ceremony somewhat
resembling the Navazûdî (see Bd. XXX, 28 n), but celebrated either late
in life, or after death.

<span id="fn_1104"></span>[262:4](sbe24093.htm#fr_1112) Lp, B29 have
'that they celebrate.'

<span id="fn_1105"></span>[263:1](sbe24093.htm#fr_1113) Lp, B29 omit
'both.'

<span id="fn_1106"></span>[263:2](sbe24093.htm#fr_1114) Lp omits
'therefore,' and B29 has 'certainly.'

<span id="fn_1107"></span>[263:3](sbe24093.htm#fr_1115) Lp, B29, J15 add
'and, afterwards they bring the Gêtî,' and Lp continues thus: 'the
meaning is adduced in Pâzand.'

<span id="fn_1108"></span>[263:4](sbe24093.htm#fr_1116) This explains
'the heavenly Gâhs' of Bd. XXX, 28. The Sad Darband-i Hush (as quoted in
B29, fol. 458 b) says that it is stated in revelation that the day when
one celebrates the Gêtî-kharî*d* of any one, the soul of that person
seizes-upon the heavenly Gâhs three times in that one day, *and* is
conveyed to heaven and the supreme heaven.'

<span id="fn_1109"></span>[263:5](sbe24093.htm#fr_1117) Lp, B29 have 'is
brought into sight.'

<span id="fn_1110"></span>[263:6](sbe24093.htm#fr_1118) Lp, B29 have
'arrives at.'
