<p>1. The twenty-eighth subject is this, that, when they teach the Avesta, it is <I>in</I> like manner necessary</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_291"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 291</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that they teach <I>it</I> properly and truly, <I>and</I> recite <I>it</I> with deliberation and composure (s&acirc;kin&icirc;). 2. And it is necessary <I>for</I> those who are taught to recite <I>it</I> connectedly, and to keep <I>it</I> ever <I>in</I> remembrance.</p>  
<p>3. For it is declared in revelation, that the sacred being <I>has</I> decreed thus: '<I>As to</I> every one who puts the Avesta away from <I>his</I> memory, I <I>will</I> put his soul as far from heaven as the width of the earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1254"></A><A HREF="#fn_1244"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' 4. And in the commentary of the Avesta it is related <I>that</I>, in former times, <I>as to</I> any one who had been taught the Avesta and had put <I>it</I> away from <I>his</I> memory, until the time he had again made <I>it</I> easy, they would have given him bread like that which they give to the dogs. 5. <I>And in</I> another place I have read that they would have given bread to him <I>on</I> the point of a spear.</p>
