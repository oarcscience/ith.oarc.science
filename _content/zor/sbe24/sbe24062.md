### CHAPTER LVI.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Wherefore are these
mountains and rivers <span id="fr_522"></span>[1](#fn_515) made, which
are in the world?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'Of these mountains, which
are in the world, there are *some* which are moderators of the wind, and
there are *some* which are <span id="fr_523"></span>[2](#fn_516) warders
off; (5) there are *some* which are the place and vent, the
resting-place and support of the rainy cloud; (6) and there are *some*
which are smiters of Aharman and the demons, and maintainers and
vivifiers of the creatures and creation of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord.

7\. 'And these rivers, which are in the world, the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*
has formed, from the borders of Albûr*z* <span
id="fr_524"></span>[3](#fn_517), for providing the protection and *for*
the vivification of his own creatures and creation.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_515"></span>[98:1](sbe24062.htm#fr_522) Or it may be
'seas,' as the Sanskrit version translates the word, both here and in §
7, but this hardly agrees with the context,

<span id="fn_516"></span>[98:2](sbe24062.htm#fr_523) L19 omits these
five words.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[98:3](sbe24062.htm#fr_524) See Chap. XLIV, 16
n.
