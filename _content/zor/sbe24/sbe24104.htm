<p>1. The sixteenth subject is this, that, when a woman becomes pregnant in a house, it is necessary to make an endeavour so that <I>there may</I> be a continual fire in that house, and to maintain a good watch <I>over it</I>. 2. And, when the child becomes separate from the mother, it is necessary to burn a lamp <I>for</I> three nights <I>and</I> days&#151;if they burn a fire it would be better&#151;so that the demons and fiends <I>may</I> not be able to do any damage and harm; because, when a child is born, it is exceedingly delicate <I>for</I> those three days.</p>

During forty days it is not proper that they <I>should</I> leave the child alone; and it is also not proper that the mother of the infant <I>should</I> put <I>her</I> foot over a threshold in the dwelling, or cast <I>her</I> eyes upon a hill, <I>for</I> it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1192"></A><A HREF="#fn_1183"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is bad <I>for</I> her menstruation.</p>
