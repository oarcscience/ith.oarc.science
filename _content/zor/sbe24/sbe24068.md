### CHAPTER LXII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: '*In* what place
stands Kangde*z*? 3. Where is the enclosure formed by Yim
constructed <span id="fr_592"></span>[8](#fn_584)? 4. *In* what

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

place lies <span id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_585) the body of Sâhm? 5.
Where is the abode of Srôsh? 6. *In* what place stands the three-legged
ass? 7. Where is the Hôm grown, the preparer of the dead, with which
they restore the dead and produce the future existence? 8. In which
place is <span id="fr_594"></span>[2](#fn_586) Gôpaîtôshah? 9. With what
work is the Kar fish intrusted? 10. Where has the griffon bird a nest
(â*s*îyân) <span id="fr_595"></span>[3](#fn_587)? 11. *In* what place
sits *K*înâmrô*s*, and what is his work?'

12\. The spirit of wisdom answered (13) thus: 'Kangde*z* <span
id="fr_596"></span>[4](#fn_588) is intrusted with the. eastern quarter,
near to Satavâyês <span id="fr_597"></span>[5](#fn_589), (14) on the
frontier of Aîrân-vê*g*ô <span id="fr_598"></span>[6](#fn_590).

15\. 'The enclosure formed by Yim <span id="fr_599"></span>[7](#fn_591)
is constructed in Aîrân-vê*g*ô, below the earth <span
id="fr_600"></span>[8](#fn_592). 16. And every species and seed of all
the creatures and creations of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord, whatever is
better and more select of man and beast *of burden, of* cattle and
flying creatures is brought thither <span
id="fr_601"></span>[9](#fn_593). 17. And every forty years one child is
born from one woman and one man <span id="fr_602"></span>[10](#fn_594)
who are of that place; (18) their life,

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

too, is three hundred years <span id="fr_603"></span>[1](#fn_595), (19)
and their pain and disturbance are little <span
id="fr_604"></span>[2](#fn_596).

20\. 'The body of Sâhm <span id="fr_605"></span>[3](#fn_597) is in the
plain of Pê*s*ândas <span id="fr_606"></span>[4](#fn_598), near to Mount
Dimâvand <span id="fr_607"></span>[5](#fn_599). 21. And on that plain,
except corn and the eatable things they sow and reap *and* live upon,
there is not so much as a single other tree <span
id="fr_608"></span>[6](#fn_600), *or* shrub, *or* plant; (22) and its
golden colour is mostly wormwood <span id="fr_609"></span>[7](#fn_601).
23. And the angels and archangels have appointed 99,999 guardian spirits
of the righteous as a protection for the body of Sâhm <span
id="fr_610"></span>[8](#fn_602), (24) so that the demons and fiends
*may* not injure it.

25\. 'The abode of Srôsh <span id="fr_611"></span>[9](#fn_603) is mostly
in Arzah <span id="fr_612"></span>[10](#fn_604), and afterwards also in
Savah and the whole world.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

26\. 'The three-legged ass <span id="fr_613"></span>[1](#fn_605)
sits <span id="fr_614"></span>[2](#fn_606) amid the sea Varkash <span
id="fr_615"></span>[3](#fn_607); (27) and *as to* water of every kind
that rains on dead matter, the menstrual discharge, and other bodily
refuse <span id="fr_616"></span>[4](#fn_608), when it arrives at the
three-legged ass, he makes every kind clean and purified, with
watchfulness.

28\. 'The Hôm <span id="fr_617"></span>[5](#fn_609), which is the
preparer of the dead, is grown in the sea Varkash, in that which is the
deepest place; (29) and 99,999 guardian spirits of the righteous are
appointed *as* its protection <span id="fr_618"></span>[6](#fn_610). 30.
The Kar fish <span id="fr_619"></span>[7](#fn_611), too, ever circles
around it, and always keeps the frog and other noxious creatures away
from it.

31\. 'Gôpaîtôshah <span id="fr_620"></span>[8](#fn_612) is in
Aîrân-vê*g*ô, within the region of Khvanîras <span
id="fr_621"></span>[9](#fn_613). 32. From foot to mid-body *he* is an
ox, and from mid-body to the top *he* is a man. 33. And *at* all times
he sits on the sea-shore, (34) and always performs the ceremonial of the
sacred beings, and pours holy-water into the sea. 35. On account of
which <span id="fr_622"></span>[10](#fn_614), through the pouring of
that holy-water, innumerable noxious creatures in

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

the sea will die. 36. Because, if he does not specially perform that
celebration of the ceremonial, and does not pour that holy-water into
the sea—where those innumerable noxious creatures shall utterly
perish <span id="fr_623"></span>[1](#fn_615)—then, whenever the rain
shall rain, the noxious creatures *have* to rain just like rain.

37\. 'The nest of the griffon bird <span id="fr_624"></span>[2](#fn_616)
is on the tree. opposed to harm, the many-seeded <span
id="fr_625"></span>[3](#fn_617). 38. Whenever he rises aloft a thousand
twigs will shoot out from that tree, (39) and when he alights he breaks
off the thousand twigs and bites the seed from them. 40. And the bird
*K*înâmrô*s* <span id="fr_626"></span>[4](#fn_618) alights likewise *in*
that vicinity; (41) and his work is this, that he collects those seeds
which are bitten from the tree of many seeds, which is opposed to harm,
and he scatters (pargandê*d*) *them* there where Tî*s*tar <span
id="fr_627"></span>[5](#fn_619) seizes the water; (42) so that, while
Tî*s*tar shall seize the water, *together* with those seeds of all
kinds, he shall rain *them* on the world with the rain <span
id="fr_628"></span>[6](#fn_620).'

<span id="fn_586"></span>[109:2](sbe24068.htm#fr_594) L19 has 'remains.'

<span id="fn_587"></span>[109:3](sbe24068.htm#fr_595) L19 has 'a
resting-place.'

<span id="fn_588"></span>[109:4](sbe24068.htm#fr_596) See Chap. XXVII,
58, 62.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[109:5](sbe24068.htm#fr_597) Av. Satavaêsa, the
western leader of the stars *a*nd special opponent of the planet
Anâhî*d* (Venus), which may, perhaps, he identified with. Antares (see
Bd. II, 7, V, I), though Geiger (Ost. Kul. p. 313) thinks Vega more
probable. It also protects the southern seas, and its name is applied to
the gulf of ’Umân in that direction (see Bd. XIII, 9-13, Zs. VI,
16,.18). But its connection with the east, as implied in our text,
requires explanation, and throws some doubt upon the reading.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[109:6](sbe24068.htm#fr_598) See Chap. XLIV,
17-23.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[109:7](sbe24068.htm#fr_599) See Chap. XXVII,
27-31.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[109:8](sbe24068.htm#fr_600) So stated in Bd.
XXXII, 5, and probably meaning that its position could no longer be
discovered on earth. Bd. XXIX, 14 states that it is in the middle of
Pârs, below Mount Yimakân.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[109:9](sbe24068.htm#fr_601) See Vend. II,
106-113.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[109:10](sbe24068.htm#fr_602) Perhaps we should
understand 'from each woman and each <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>
man,' that is, a couple of children from each couple, which would agree
with Vend. II, 134.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[110:1](sbe24068.htm#fr_603) Pahl. Vend. II,
136 has 150 years.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[110:2](sbe24068.htm#fr_604) The
characteristics mentioned in §§ 17-19 are ascribed to the whole of
Aîrân-vê*g*ô in Chap. XLIV, 25, 27, 32.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[110:3](sbe24068.htm#fr_605) See Chap. XXVII,
49.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[110:4](sbe24068.htm#fr_606) L19 has Pu*s*t
Gu*s*tâspã, 'the ridge of Vi*s*tâsp,' which appears, from Bd. XII, 18,
34, XVII, 8, to have been somewhere in the central desert of Persia. In
Bd. XXIX, 7-9, 11 we are told that Sam lies asleep in the plain of
Pê*s*yânsaî (evidently the Pê*s*ândas of our text) in Kâvulistân, till
he is waked hereafter to slay Dahâk, who escapes from Mount Dimâvand.
This legend may have led to the perplexing juxtaposition of Pê*s*ândas
and Dimâvand in our text, and the perplexity occasioned by this may have
led Nêr. to substitute Pû*s*t-î Vi*s*tâspân for the former name, as
being nearer Dimâvand.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[110:5](sbe24068.htm#fr_607) The highest peak
of the modern Albûr*z*, in which Dahâk is said to be confined (see Bd.
XII, 31).

<span id="fn_600"></span>[110:6](sbe24068.htm#fr_608) Reading hânŏ
drû-aê; L19 has han mûrd, 'another myrtle-bush.'

<span id="fn_601"></span>[110:7](sbe24068.htm#fr_609) With yellow
blossoms.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[110:8](sbe24068.htm#fr_610) As stated in
Fravar*d*in Yt. 61.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[110:9](sbe24068.htm#fr_611) See Chap. II, 115.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[110:10](sbe24068.htm#fr_612) The western
region, as Savah is the eastern one (see Chap. XVI, 10).

<span id="fn_605"></span>[111:1](sbe24068.htm#fr_613) A prodigious
monster of benevolent character, described in Bd. XIX, 1-12; possibly
some local divinity.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[111:2](sbe24068.htm#fr_614) L19 has 'stands,'
as is also slated in Yas. XLI, 28.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[111:3](sbe24068.htm#fr_615) See Chap. XLIV,
15.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[111:4](sbe24068.htm#fr_616) L19 adds 'and
pollution.'

<span id="fn_609"></span>[111:5](sbe24068.htm#fr_617) The white Hôm or
Gôkarn, the tree of immortality (see Bd. XVIII, 1, XXVIII 4). It is 'the
preparer of the dead,' because the elixir of immortality is expected to
be prepared from it at the, resurrection (see Bd. XXX, 25).

<span id="fn_610"></span>[111:6](sbe24068.htm#fr_618) Those who watch
over the sea Vouru-kasha (see Fravar*d*in Yt. 59)

<span id="fn_611"></span>[111:7](sbe24068.htm#fr_619) Ten such fish, of
enormous size and intense watchfulness, are said to be employed to
protect the Gôkarn from a lizard or frog sent by Aharman to injure it
(see Bd. XVIII, 2-6).

<span id="fn_612"></span>[111:8](sbe24068.htm#fr_620) See Chap. XLIV, 35
n.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[111:9](sbe24068.htm#fr_621) See Chap. XXVII,
40.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[111:10](sbe24068.htm#fr_622) L19 Omits these
four words.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[112:1](sbe24068.htm#fr_623) L19 has 'and those
innumerable noxious creatures do not utterly perish.'

<span id="fn_616"></span>[112:2](sbe24068.htm#fr_624) The Sênô-mûrûv
(Av. saênô mereghô) or Simurgh, a mythic flying creature said to suckle
its young and to be of three natures like the bat (see Bd. XIV, 11, 24,
XIX, 18).

<span id="fn_617"></span>[112:3](sbe24068.htm#fr_625) L19 has 'of all
seeds.' This tree, from which all wild plants are supposed to spring, is
said to grow in the sea near the Gôkarn tree, and also in Aîrân-vê*g*ô
(see Bd. IX, 5, 6, XVIII, 9, XXVII, 2, XXIX, 5).

<span id="fn_618"></span>[112:4](sbe24068.htm#fr_626) The chief of
mythic birds next to the Sênô-mûrûv; he is said to defend Irân from
invasion by occasionally picking up foreign districts like grains of
corn (see Bd. XIX, 15, XXIV, 29).

<span id="fn_619"></span>[112:5](sbe24068.htm#fr_627) The angel who
personifies the star Tî*s*tar (Sirius, see Chap. XLIX, 5, 6), after a
conflict with the demons of drought and thunder (see Bd. VII, 1-13),
pours down rain from the cloud, in which he had brought the water from
the sea.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[112:6](sbe24068.htm#fr_628) Originally, the
archangel Ame*r*oda*d* (see Chap. II, 34) is said <span id="page_113">p.
113</span> to have mingled the plants with the rain (see Bd. IX, 2); but
afterwards this was done by the mythic bird (see Bd. XXVII, 3). This
legend was evidently intended to account for the rapid appearance of
wild plants after rain in dry climates, where all traces of vegetation
often disappear during the summer droughts.
