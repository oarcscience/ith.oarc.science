### CHAPTER III.

1\. The third subject is this, that it is necessary *for* man that he be
continuously employed (ma*sgh*ûl) on his own work, and then the work
becomes his own.

2\. For it is declared in revelation, that every one who hereafter
becomes employed <span id="fr_1094"></span>[2](#fn_1086) *on* his own
work, if in the midst of that work any trouble and discomfort happen to
him, obtains in that *other* world twelve recompenses <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[3](#fn_1087) for every single *instance*. 3. If he
becomes employed *on* iniquity (fasâd), and in the midst of that work
any trouble and harm happen to him, he so <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[4](#fn_1088) obtains in that *other* world only
torment (’huqûbat) and punishment.

4\. Similarly (maTHalâ*m*), if any one be himself going, employed on his
own work, and a robber falls

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

upon him on the road, and carries off his property (qumâ*s*), or he be
slain <span id="fr_1097"></span>[1](#fn_1089), they give him back in
that *other* world four *things* for each one <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[2](#fn_1090) of whatever they have carried off. 5.
If he be slain he becomes righteous, any sin that he has committed goes
clean *away* from him, *and* they convey him to heaven. 6. But (ammâ) if
he becomes faulty (bâ*t*il) in any duty, and a robber falls upon him on
the road <span id="fr_1099"></span>[3](#fn_1091), and carries off his
wealth (mâl), or he be slain, when he descends to that *other*
world <span id="fr_1100"></span>[4](#fn_1092) all the property that
*other* carried off from him becomes just as *though it were* his who
has carried it off from that person <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[5](#fn_1093); and, besides, *there* occur, as a
substitute (’hivaʓ̣) *for* that property, the punishment and torment they
give him. 7. *And* if he be slain it is just as *though* he who has
carried it off from that person *were one* who had innocently slain that
person who arrives in hell as retribution (mukâfât) for sin.
