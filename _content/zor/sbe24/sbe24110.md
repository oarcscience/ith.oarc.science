### CHAPTER XXII.

1\. The twenty-second subject is this, that the performance of
*G*âda*n*gôî <span id="fr_1228"></span>[2](#fn_1218) ('intercession') is
like that when some one is occasioning the ceremonial of the sacred
beings. 2. Therefore, it should be expedient that it be continuous, *and
that* <span id="fr_1229"></span>[3](#fn_1219) they perform *G*âda*n*gôî
as regards the priests and high-priests and the worthy.

3\. For, in the commentary of the Hâ*d*ôkht Nask, it says that every one
who performs *G*âda*n*gôî, and extracts anything from a person on their
account, and conveys *it* to them, is as much without dishonesty
(‘*h*iyânat), towards them <span id="fr_1230"></span>[4](#fn_1220), as
he who may

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

have given to them out of his own property. 4. And *in* the spiritual
*existence* they take <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1](#fn_1221) account of
that profit for him, and just as they make *out* the account of the good
work of that person who may have given *it*, even so much is his good
work.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1218"></span>[285:2](sbe24110.htm#fr_1228) The original
Pahlavi of this word can be read either dâ*d*ŏ-gôbîh, 'a speaking of the
law,' or yêdatô-gôbîh, 'a speaking of the sacred being;' in either case
it implies 'pleading for the proper observance of religious duties,'
especially the duty of supporting the priesthood and the poor, and it is
for such purposes that the 'intercession' with those possessing property
must be understood as being exercised. As the traditional mode of
reading Pahl. yêdatô is *g*âtan, or *g*â*d*an, it is evident that the
Pâzand inventors of the word in the text must have understood the
Pahlavi in the latter of the two meanings mentioned above.

<span id="fn_1219"></span>[285:3](sbe24110.htm#fr_1229) Lp, B29 have
merely 'that continuously.'

<span id="fn_1220"></span>[285:4](sbe24110.htm#fr_1230) Lp, B29 omit
these two words. But the meaning of La seems to be that he who bestows
charity out of the contributions of others, without mentioning the
contributors, does not act dishonestly towards the recipients.

<span id="fn_1221"></span>[286:1](sbe24110.htm#fr_1231) Lp, B29 have
'the spirits take.'
