### CHAPTER LIX.

1\. The fifty-ninth subject is this, that, in the good *and* pure
religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, they have not commanded the women
to perform the Nyâyi*s*es <span id="fr_1387"></span>[2](#fn_1376). 2.
And <span id="fr_1388"></span>[3](#fn_1377) their Nyâyi*s*es are these,
that three times every day, *at* dawn, mid-day <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[4](#fn_1378) prayer, and evening prayer, they stand
back in the presence of their own husbands, and fold their arms and
speak thus: 'What are thy thoughts, so that I *may* think them; what is
necessary for thee, so that I *may* speak it; and what is necessary for
thee, so that I *may* do it?'

3\. For, any command, and whatever the husband

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

orders, it is requisite to go about that day. 4. *And*, certainly,
without the leave (riʓ̣â) of the husband *she is* to do no work, so that
the Lord *may* be pleased with that wife. 5. For the satisfaction of the
sacred being is in a reverence (ya*s*t) for <span
id="fr_1390"></span>[1](#fn_1379) the satisfaction of the husband; so
that every time that they perform work *by* command of the husband they
call them righteous in the religion; and if not, what do they call them?
