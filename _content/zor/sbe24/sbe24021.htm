<p>1. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Is poverty good, or opulence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?'</p>  
<p>3. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'Poverty which is through honesty is better than opulence which is from the treasure of others. 5. For it is stated (6) thus: "<I>As to</I> him who is the poorest and most secluded (arm&ecirc;<I>s</I>tt&ucirc;m)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> person, whenever he keeps his thoughts, words, <I>and</I> deeds honest, and in duty to the sacred beings, for him even <I>there</I> is lawfully a share of all the duties and good works which mankind shall do in the world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 7. <I>As to</I> him, too, who is opulent, who is a man of much wealth, when the wealth is not produced by honesty, though he takes trouble (an<I>g</I>&icirc;nak&#335;) in&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> duties and good works and righteous gifts, his good work is then not his own, (8) because the good work is his from whom <I>the wealth</I> is abstracted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_227"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_230">42:1</A> L19 adds 'or sovereignty,' to account for &sect;&sect; 12-39.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_228"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_231">42:2</A> Av. arma&ecirc;<I>s</I>ta, applied to water, means 'most stationary, stagnant;' Pahl. arm&ecirc;<I>s</I>t (Av. airima) is applied to the place of 'seclusion' for impure men and women, and in Sls. VI, 1 it seems to refer to 'helpless' idiots or lunatics; N&ecirc;r. explains it in Sanskrit as 'lame, crippled, immobility,' but 'secluded, immured, helpless' are terms better adapted to the context, whether the word be applied to persons, as it is here and in Chaps. XXXVII, 36, XXXIX, 40, or to learning and character, as in Chap. LI, 7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_229"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_232">42:3</A> Persons who are wholly unable to perform good works are supposed to be entitled to a share of any supererogatory good works performed by others (see Sls. VI, 1, 2), but the allotment of such imputed good works seems to be at the discretion of the angels who keep them in store (see Sls. VIII, 4).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_230"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_233">42:4</A> N&ecirc;r. has 'makes expenditure on,' by reading khvaz&icirc;nak, as in Chap. XIII, 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_231"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_234">42:5</A> &sect; 8 does not occur in L19, but is found in TD2, PA10, and MH7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_232"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_235">43:1</A> That is, the proper use of wealth does not make the wealth itself any better, but only the rightful possessor of it. This is, however, probably only an emendation of N&ecirc;r., as the copy of TD2 gives merely the following, for &sect;&sect; 9-11: 'But <I>as to</I> him who is a man of much wealth, by whose proper exertion it is collected, <I>and</I> he consumes <I>and</I> maintains <I>it</I> with duties, good works, and pleasure, he is no better thereby, because it is necessary to consider him as perfect.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_233"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_237">43:2</A> L19 omits 'what is' in both places.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_234"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_238">43:3</A> TD2 omits 'maintains,' as it is sufficiently expressed by the same Pahl. verb 'keeps' in &sect; 19; and. L19 omits 'by law.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_235"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_239">44:1</A> Reading d&acirc;<I>d</I>&#335;-g&ocirc;b&icirc;h, 'pronouncing the law,' or 'speaking of gifts,' instead of P&acirc;z. <I>g</I>&acirc;da<I>n</I>g&ocirc;&icirc;, a misreading of N&ecirc;r. for Pahl. y&ecirc;dat&ocirc;-g&ocirc;b&icirc;h, speaking of the sacred being.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_236"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_240">44:2</A> The usual way of treating nonconformists in all ages and all sects, when party spirit is strong. TD2 has 'delivers <I>him</I> up for the sake of body and soul.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_237"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_241">44:3</A> TD2 has 'good government which.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_238"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_242">44:4</A> TD2 has 'keeps;' but the two verbs are much alike in Huzv&acirc;ri<I>s</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_239"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_243">44:5</A> Because nearly all such works entail expenditure.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_240"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_244">44:6</A> N&ecirc;r. has 'accumulation,' but this is the meaning of and&ocirc;<I>z</I>i<I>s</I>n, rather than of the and&acirc;<I>z</I>i<I>s</I>n in the text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_241"></A><A HREF="sbe24021.htm#fr_245">44:7</A> So in TD2.</P>
