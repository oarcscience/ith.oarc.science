### CHAPTER L.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'Which is that opulent
*person* who is to be considered as fortunate, and which is that *one*
who is *to be considered* as evil-conditioned?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'That *one* who has produced
opulence by proper exertion is to be considered as fortunate; and that
*one* who has produced *it* by dishonesty, as evil-conditioned.'
