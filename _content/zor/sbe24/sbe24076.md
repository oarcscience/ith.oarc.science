### CHAPTER VI.

1\. *As to* another delusion <span id="fr_735"></span>[3](#fn_727) of
those asserting the non-existence of a sacred being—(2) whom they call
atheistical (daharî) <span id="fr_736"></span>[4](#fn_728)—(3) that they
are ordained *free* from religious trouble (alag) and the toil of
practising good works, (4) and the unlimited twaddle (drâyi*s*n) <span
id="fr_737"></span>[5](#fn_729) they abundantly chatter, (5) you <span
id="fr_738"></span>[6](#fn_730) should observe this:—6. That they
account this world, with the much change and adjustment of description
of its members *and* appliances, *their* antagonism to one another, and
their confusion with one another, *as* an original evolution <span
id="fr_739"></span>[7](#fn_731) of boundless time. 7. And this, too,
that there is no reward of good works, no punishment of sin, no heaven
and hell, and no stimulator of good works and crime. 8. Besides

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

this, that things are only worldly, and there is no spirit.

9\. As I *have* written and shown above <span
id="fr_740"></span>[1](#fn_732)—(10) that to be made without a maker,
and decided without a decider, is as impossible as to prepare *what* is
written without a writer, *or* a house without a mortar-mixer
(râ*z*) <span id="fr_741"></span>[2](#fn_733) and building
(dê*s*âk)—(11) things made, of all kinds, cannot arise without making.

12\. And this worldly *existence* is owing to the mingling of competing
powers. 13. So *its* numerous possessions are so constructed, selected,
*and* made of diverse races (*k*îharân), diverse colours, diverse
scents, diverse characteristics, *and* diverse species as I *have*
stated above <span id="fr_742"></span>[3](#fn_734) about the body, (14)
that it is constructed *and* made out of many things, such as bone, fat,
sinew, veins, skin, blood, breath, hair <span
id="fr_743"></span>[4](#fn_735), fundament <span
id="fr_744"></span>[5](#fn_736), hand, foot, head, belly, *and* other
members, internal and external, (15) in two series <span
id="fr_745"></span>[6](#fn_737) of things of many kinds, of which *to
be* never made by means of the diverse nature of diverse powers, (16) or
to arise without a maker, the impossibility is certain.

17\. And *in* like manner of the other creatures, plants *and* trees,
water *and* fire, earth and air, their stimulus, too, which is not
themselves, is to their own duty; and they are not stimulators, (18) but
there is a stimulator, a building (dê*s*âk), and a making for

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

them. 19. And the usage (vâzâr) which is changing *and* urging them,
from stimulus to stimulus, from statement to statement, *and* from time
to time, is not according to the will and requirement of those made, but
according to those that are stimulating and making.

20\. Even so, indicative of the rotation of the years, months, days,
*and* hours, is the revolution of the *celestial* sphere and stars which
are settled (pasâkhtak), and *of* the sun and moon which are adjusted
(nîvâr*d*ak), a well-horsed <span id="fr_746"></span>[1](#fn_738)
progress *and* conspicuous revolution. 21. This, too, is an indication
that the movements of every appearance (*k*îharîh) are owing to an
exhibitor, by whom the movement of that appearance is exhibited.

22\. Owing to other differences and different management in the worldly
*existence* (23) it is possible to know, from the worldly *existence* at
various times *and* various periods, that this worldly *existence* is
not without a manager. 24. Or *that* its manager is not a sacred
being <span id="fr_747"></span>[2](#fn_739), who is learned, acting
reasonably, of unlimited power, and illumining <span
id="fr_748"></span>[3](#fn_740) the sky, is also that which is visible
when the development, decay, and death of the world are such, that the
nature alike of mankind and animals, and alike of races and trees, is to
come from youth to old age, *and* from old age to death. 25. No one
whatever is seen *that has* come from old age back to youth, *or* from
death back to life, and *it* is not

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

possible to say *so*. 26. Nor yet is it proper to think, say, *or*
believe this, (27) that there is no recompense of good works and
punishment of crime, (28) nor even an appearance of an attainable
creator of all the creatures, and *of* the daubing of a destroyer.

29\. Moreover, *as to* this *latter*, that is precious to those who are
more friends of penury than *of* the comfort of ill-famed vileness—(30)
because they produce their happiness thereby <span
id="fr_749"></span>[1](#fn_741), and are grateful, (31) and when they
see distress they become suppliants (32) even from this destiny and
dispensation which cannot become spiritual except by the spirits—(33)
even so, in the appearance of every one *of* the hungry, (34) *and* in
every one hurrying and straitened <span id="fr_750"></span>[2](#fn_742),
who is imploring favours, is a manifestation of the maintenance of a
hope for a supreme inspection over mankind, *and*, indeed, over wild
animals, birds, *and* quadrupeds.

35\. *As to* this, too, which they call sophistical <span
id="fr_751"></span>[3](#fn_743). (36) that there is no assurance of even
one of *these* things, (37) because all are jaundiced <span
id="fr_752"></span>[4](#fn_744)—(38) for whoever says that honey is
bitter and honey is sweet, is right *in* both, (39) since *it* is bitter
to those abounding in bile, *and* sweet to others; (40) also bread is
pleasant and bread is unpleasant are both

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

true, (41) since *it* is pleasant to the hungry, *and* unpleasant to the
surfeited; (42) *and* many other *statements* of this description—(43)
that *which* should be said in reply to their twaddle is summarily (44)
such as the wise *have* told them (45) thus:—'Even this statement of you
sophists, about the jaundiced nature of everything, is alike jaundiced,
and there is no truth *in* it.'

46\. Many other *things* are said among them; (47) and this that is
indicated by us is the predominant information *for* you victors, (48)
so that you *may* obtain more from revelation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_727"></span>[146:3](sbe24076.htm#fr_735) Pâz. vyâwãnî (see
Chap. III, 22 n).

<span id="fn_728"></span>[146:4](sbe24076.htm#fr_736) Sans. digambara
refers this term to Buddhist ascetics, the nearest approach to atheists
with which Nêr. was acquainted.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[146:5](sbe24076.htm#fr_737) A contemptuous
term for the speech of evil beings.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[146:6](sbe24076.htm#fr_738) Or it may be
'one,' as the Sanskrit uses the third person.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[146:7](sbe24076.htm#fr_739) See Chap. IV, 73
n.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[147:1](sbe24076.htm#fr_740) Chap. V, 27-30.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[147:2](sbe24076.htm#fr_741) Sans. has
'carpenter.'

<span id="fn_734"></span>[147:3](sbe24076.htm#fr_742) Chap. V, 57-63.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[147:4](sbe24076.htm#fr_743) Assuming that Pâz.
vas is a misreading of Pahl. varas. Nêr. has Sans. rasa, 'liquid
secretion.'

<span id="fn_736"></span>[147:5](sbe24076.htm#fr_744) Supposing that
Pâz. daryam (Sans. nish*th*â) stands for Pahl. dar-î dum.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[147:6](sbe24076.htm#fr_745) Literally
'columns.'

<span id="fn_738"></span>[148:1](sbe24076.htm#fr_746) Alluding to the
supposed horses of the sun. Sans. has 'brilliant.'

<span id="fn_739"></span>[148:2](sbe24076.htm#fr_747) That is, the world
cannot be controlled by a, sacred being alone, on account of the evil it
contains.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[148:3](sbe24076.htm#fr_748) Sans. has
'making,' another meaning of varz.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[149:1](sbe24076.htm#fr_749) By performing the
good work of charity, which is necessary for the future happiness of
their own souls.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[149:2](sbe24076.htm#fr_750) Assuming that Pâz.
*hv*a*s*tâw u vada*n*g is a misreading of Pahl. aû*s*ta*v*ŏ va tang.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[149:3](sbe24076.htm#fr_751) Pâz. suwastaî
(Sans. suvastâyîka) is evidently traceable to σοφιστικός through Pers.
sûfis*t*âiyah.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[149:4](sbe24076.htm#fr_752) Pâz. tahal (Sans.
ka*t*uka) is transposed in Pers. tal‘*h*, 'bitter,' in which sense the
word is used in §§ 38, 39, and Chap. III, 24.
