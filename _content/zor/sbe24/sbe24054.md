### CHAPTER XLVIII.

1\. The sage asked the spirit of wisdom (2) thus: 'How is the dwelling
of the understanding and intellect and seed of men in the body?'

3\. The spirit of wisdom answered (4) thus: 'The place of the
understanding and intellect and seed of men is in the brain of the head.
5. And when the brain of the head is sound, the understanding and
intellect and seed are on the increase; (6) *but* when a person attains
unto old age, the brain of the head remains only at a diminution. 7. And
he who is an aged man, on account of the diminution of understanding and
intellect, sees less and knows less of that which it is necessary to do
with wisdom. 8. Wisdom, in the beginning, mingles with the marrow of the
fingers of men's hands; (9) and, afterwards,

its seat and abode and place <span id="fr_476"></span>[1](#fn_471) are
in the heart. 10. And its dwelling <span id="fr_477"></span>[2](#fn_472)
in the whole body becomes such as the shape of the foot in various shoes
(mûg*k*akŏ). <span id="fr_478"></span>[3](#fn_473)'
