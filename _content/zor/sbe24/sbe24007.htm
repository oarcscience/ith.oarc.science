For the same reason <I>it</I> is declared, (15) that <I>there</I> was a sage who said, (16) that 'if this be known, that the religion of the sacred beings (ya<I>z</I><I>d</I>&acirc;n) is truth, and <I>its</I> law is virtue, and <I>it</I> is desirous of welfare and compassionate as regards the creatures, (17) wherefore are <I>there</I> mostly many sects, many beliefs, and many original evolutions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of mankind? 18.

And this, too, <I>one has</I> to consider, that, in order to become a chooser in this matter, trouble is to be undergone; (21) and it is necessary to become acquainted with this matter, (22) because, in the end, the body is mingled with the dust, and reliance is on the soul. 23. And every one is to undergo trouble for the soul, (24) and is to become acquainted with duty and good works; (25) because that good work which a man does unwittingly is little of a good work, (26) and that sin which a man</p>

And <I>it</I> is declared by the Avesta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (28) thus:]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>" Nothing <I>was</I> taken by him by whom the soul <I>was</I> not taken (29) hitherto, and he takes nothing who does not take the soul (30) henceforward likewise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; (31) because the spiritual and worldly <I>existences</I> are such-like as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> two strongholds, (32) one <I>it</I> is declared certain that they shall capture, and one it is not possible to capture."'</p>

<p>one another, (38) he then knew that these religions and beliefs and diverse customs, which are so mutually afflicting among one another in this world, are not worthy to be from the appointment of the sacred beings; (39) because the religion of the sacred beings is truth, and <I>its</I> law is virtue. 40. And through this he became without doubt that, <I>as to</I> whatever&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is not in this pure religion, <I>there</I> is then doubtfulness for them in everything, (41) and. in every cause they see distraction.</p>  
<p>42. After that he became more diligent in the enquiry and practice of religion; (43) and he enquired of the high-priests who have become wiser in&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> this religion and more acquainted <I>with</I> the religion, (44) thus: 'For the maintenance of the body <I>and</I> preservation of the soul what thing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is good and more perfect?'</p>  
<p>45. And they [spoke&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>], through the statement [from revelation, (46) thus: 'Of the&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> benefit which happens to men] wisdom is good; (47) because it is possible to manage the worldly <I>existence</I> through wisdoms, (48) and it is possible to provide also the spiritual existence for oneself through the power of wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. 49. And this, too, is declared, that A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> has produced these creatures and creation, which are in the worldly <I>existence</I>, through innate</p>

<p>51. And when, in that manner, he saw the great advantage and preciousness of wisdom, he became more thankful unto A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, the lord, and the archangels of&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the spirit of wisdom; (52) and he took&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the spirit of wisdom as a protection. 53. For the spirit of wisdom <I>one</I> is to perform more homage and service than <I>for</I> the remaining archangels. 54. And this, too, he knew, that it is possible to do for oneself every duty and good work and proper action through the power of wisdom; (55) and it is necessary to be diligent for the satisfaction of the spirit of wisdom. 56. And, thenceforward, he became more diligent in performing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the ceremonial of the spirit of wisdom.</p>  
<p>57. After that the spirit of wisdom, on account of the thoughts and wishes of that sage, displayed <I>his</I> person unto him. 58. And he spoke to him (59) thus: 'O friend <I>and</I> glorifier! good from perfect righteousness! (60) seek advancement from me, the spirit of wisdom, (61) that I may become thy guide to the satisfaction of the sacred beings and</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_32"></A><A HREF="sbe24007.htm#fr_33">3:1</A> This heading is prefixed to the original Pahlavi text in K43, a facsimile of which was published by Andreas in 1882; as, however, the text which follows it, in that codex, begins in the middle of Chap. I, 28, this heading must have been composed by some copyist, after the first folio of the text had been lost from some previous copy. It is, therefore, doubtful whether the name he gives to the work, 'Opinions (or decisions) of the Spirit of Wisdom,' be the original title, or not; but it is, at any rate, preferable to the modern appellation, 'the Spirit of Wisdom.' In P&acirc;zand this title is Mainy&ocirc;-i Khard; but regarding the Pahlavi word ma&icirc;n&ocirc;g, see the Introduction.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_33"></A><A HREF="sbe24007.htm#fr_34">3:2</A> The beginning of this chapter, enclosed in brackets, as far as &sect; 28 (being lost from the Pahlavi text of K43, and no copy of it from TD2 being available) is here taken from the P&acirc;zand version contained in L19. The division into sections, adopted throughout, is that of the alternating P&acirc;z.-Sans. text of N&ecirc;ry&ocirc;sang.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_34"></A><A HREF="sbe24007.htm#fr_35">4:1</A> That is, this work is a selection of wisdom from the religion. The P&acirc;z. va<I>s</I> is a misreading of Pahl. a<I>g</I>a<I>s</I>, 'from it,' which is identical in form with Pahl. afa<I>s</I>, the correct equivalent of P&acirc;z. va<I>s</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_36"></A><A HREF="sbe24007.htm#fr_37">4:3</A> The angels are here compared to the v&acirc;sp&ucirc;harak&acirc;n, the highest class of Sasanian nobles, called barb&ecirc;t&acirc;n, 'sons of the house,' in Huzv&acirc;ri<I>s</I> (see N&#335;ldeke's Gesch. Pers. Sas. pp. 71, 501). As these nobles ranked next to the royal house, so do the archangels and angels rank next to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>. The title v&acirc;sp&ucirc;har is evidently connected with the ancient Pers. equivalent of Av. v&icirc;s&ocirc; puthra, 'son of the village or town,' which, as Darmesteter points out (&Eacute;tudes Iraniennes, II, p. 140), is used in Vend. VII, 114 as the title of a person who has to pay the same medical fees as the za<I>n</I>tu-paiti, 'tribe-ruler,' mentioned in the earlier &sect; 108, and who must, therefore, have been a man of equal rank.</P>

A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>) constitute a considerable portion of the Avesta, or scripture of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers.</P>
