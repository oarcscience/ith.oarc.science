<p>1. And <I>as to</I> that which is asked (2) thus: 'When I always see that all things ever arise from the <I>celestial</I> sphere and stars, (3) and who created this sphere, then it is like that <I>which</I> those of the V&icirc;r&ocirc;<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_664"></A><A HREF="#fn_656"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> religion say, that he created good and evil. 4. If Aharman</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A></p>  
<p>created <I>anything</I>, how did he become able to create the effect of these marvellous things, (5) <I>and</I> why <I>is it</I> when they are stars by which assistance of virtue is always bestowed? 6. If A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> and Aharman created in conference, then that way <I>it</I> is manifest that A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is an accomplice <I>and</I> confederate, with Aharman, in the harm and evil which ever arise from the <I>celestial</I> sphere.' 7. The answer is this, (8) that the <I>celestial</I> sphere is the place of the divinities (bagh&acirc;n), who are the distributers of happiness, from which they always justly bestow their distribution of every happiness. 9. And the forms of the seven planets (star) are witches who rush below them, despoilers who are antagonistic distributers, (10) whose scriptural name is Gad&ucirc;g&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_665"></A><A HREF="#fn_657"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>11. <I>Through</I> the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> <I>was</I> the arrangement of these creatures and creation, methodically <I>and</I> sagaciously, and for the sake of the continuance of the renovation <I>of the universe</I>. 12. As the evil spirit <I>was</I> entangled in the sky, that fiend, with evil astuteness <I>and</I> with lying falsehood, encompassed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_666"></A><A HREF="#fn_658"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>and</I> mingled with the light, <I>together</I> with the fiends of crimes of many kinds, who are those of a gloomy race, <I>thinking</I> thus: 'I <I>will</I> make these creatures <I>and</I> creation of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> extinct, or I must make <I>them</I> for my own.'</p>  
<p>13. Those luminaries, the highest of those of the</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></p>  
<p>good <I>being</I>, became aware, by means of omniscience, of the blemishing operation and the lies <I>and</I> falsehoods of the fiend, (14) <I>and</I> of this too, that is, of what extent <I>was</I> this power of his, by which this blemishing operation and work of ruin creep on&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_667"></A><A HREF="#fn_659"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, (15) so that, henceforth, <I>there</I> exists no power whatever for its restoration, which is <I>free</I> from the complete daubing of restraint, pain, and entanglement that is inside the sky.</p>  
<p>16. It is they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_668"></A><A HREF="#fn_660"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who are sagaciously mingled by him (the good being) with the substance of the luminaries, because that fiend encompassed and <I>was</I> entangled with his luminaries, therefore all his powers and resources are for the purpose of not allowing the fiends of crimes of many kinds their own performance of what is desirable for them each separately; (17) such as the fiendish venom of the noxious creatures which the four elements (zahak&acirc;n), pertaining to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, [keep enveloped&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_669"></A><A HREF="#fn_661"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 18. For if this fiendish venom of the noxious creatures] does not remain entangled [with the four elements of the bodily formations pertaining to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>]&#151;which are water, fire, earth, and air&#151;<I>it is</I> just as though they came to the sky <I>and</I> spiritual<I></I> existence. 19.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> <I>And</I> if they attained to spirituality and a disembodied existence, it would not be possible for those creatures of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> to avoid <I>and</I> escape from that demoniacal venom of theirs. 20. It would be in the grasp (gr&ocirc;h&ecirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_670"></A><A HREF="#fn_662"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and mingled with the breath (v&acirc;<I>d</I>) of mankind <I>and</I> the other creatures, <I>and their</I> restoration, support, increase, <I>and</I> growth would not be possible.</p>  
<p>21. So they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_671"></A><A HREF="#fn_663"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> also keep those planets enveloped in light, because the fiendish venom of the noxious creatures is in the substance of <I>those</I> luminaries. 22. On account of that, too, the existence of somewhat of advantage is manifest from the serpent species, which are dissolving venom from the multitudes of other wild animals <I>and</I> noxious creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_672"></A><A HREF="#fn_664"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 23. So also from the planets; on account of the commingling of the inferior splendour of <I>those</I> luminaries, benefit is manifested by them.</p>  
<p>24. A similitude of these planets <I>and</I> the benefit which they always bestow (25) is such as the brigands (gad&ucirc;g&acirc;n)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_665"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> <I>and</I> highwaymen who interrupt the path of traders in a caravan. 26. They abstract important things <I>from</I> many, (27) <I>and</I> do not grant and give <I>them</I> to the diligent <I>and</I> worthy, but to sinners, idlers, courtezans, paramours, <I>and</I> the unworthy.</p>  
<p>28. <I>Observe</I> this, too, that this performance of good works which astrologers compute and state from those planets is for this reason, (29) when they have not preferred the method of the divinities</p>

And those are the five planets that rush below them in the shape of stars, and they keep <I>them</I> enveloped in light, which are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. 31. Since the supreme constellation, the great <I>one</I> of the north-opposing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_682"></A><A HREF="#fn_674"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> (32) Hapt&ocirc;iring, is opposing Saturn, (33) Hapt&ocirc;iring, created by Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a, is opposing Jupiter, (34) Vanand, the smiter of noxious creatures, is opposing Mars, (35) the star Satav&ecirc;s is opposing Venus, (36) <I>and</I> the star T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar is opposing the planetary Mercury&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_683"></A><A HREF="#fn_675"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>, (37) the welfare, which they say is from those brigands (gad&ucirc;g&acirc;n), is from those five constellations pertaining</p>

<p>to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, (38) as they obtain the triumph of much power <I>and</I> little injury.</p>  
<p>39. And for the sake of not leaving these five planets to their own wills, they are bound <I>by</I> the creator, A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, each one by two threads (<I>g</I>&icirc;k) to the sun (Mihir) and moon. 40. And their forward motion and backward motion are owing to the same cause. 41. There are <I>some</I> whose length of thread is longer, such as Saturn and Jupiter, (42) and there are <I>some of</I> which <I>it</I> is shorter, such as Mercury and Venus. 43. Every <I>time</I> when they go to the end of the threads, they draw <I>them</I> back from behind, (44) and they do not allow them to proceed by their own wills, (45) so that they <I>may</I> not injure the creatures.</p>  
<p>4.6. And those two fiends that are greatly powerful, who are opponents of the planetary sun and moon, move below the splendour of <I>those</I> two luminaries&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_684"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 47. Another&#151;even that which is called the brigand (gad&ucirc;g) of the stars, as regards the welfare that exists&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_685"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>&#151;is likewise confined below the splendour of the sun. 48. And when it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_686"></A><A HREF="#fn_678"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> gets far from control, it commits damage and harm on the constellation into which it springs, <I>and</I> on the quarter which is the particular concern of that constellation, (49) until it</p>

<p>becomes again, a second <I>time</I>, bound <I>and</I> fettered <I>to</I> the sun.</p>  
<p>50. The statement which they offer about it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_679"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (51) is this, the conflict of the superior beings within the star station. 52. Out of the inferior of those are the conflicts of T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar and the demon Spen<I>z</I>agar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_680"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (53) <I>of</I> the fire V&acirc;zi<I>s</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_681"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the demon A<I>v</I>&acirc;ush&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_690"></A><A HREF="#fn_682"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, (54) <I>and of</I> other good spirits with gloomy ones, for the formation of rain and allotment of welfare to the creatures.</p>  
<p>55. Below them are mankind and cattle, noxious creatures and deadly <I>ones</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_691"></A><A HREF="#fn_683"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and other creatures that are good and bad. 56. Because propensities (gada<I>s</I>ni) are mingled with mankind, (57) which are greed, lust, malice, wrath, and lethargy, (58) wisdom, temper, skill, knowledge, understanding, and intellect, (59) as the good influences and bad influences are called, which are the causes of good works and sin.</p>  
<p>60. All this welfare of the creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_692"></A><A HREF="#fn_684"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> is specially owing to the creator of the creatures, (61) who is himself the healer and perfect ruler, the maintainer of protection, nourisher, and caretaker, preserving his own creatures. 62. And, for his own creatures, he</p>

<p>has thoroughly created and taught the means of preservation from evil, and the appliances for abstaining from crime.</p>  
<p>63. A semblance, too, of him is such as a wise orchard-owner and gardener who wishes to diminish the wild animals and birds which are mischievous and destructive for his orchard by spoiling the fruit of the trees. 64. And that wise gardener, effacing (padas&acirc;&ecirc;) his own little trouble, for the sake of keeping those mischievous wild animals away from his own orchard, arranges the appliances which are necessary for the capture of those wild animals, (65) such as springes, traps, and snares for birds. 66. So that when a wild animal sees the snare, and wishes to proceed with suspicion of it, through unconsciousness of the springe and trap he is captured therein.</p>  
<p>67. This is certain, that, when a wild animal falls into a trap, <I>it</I> is not a victory of the trap, but that of the arranger of the trap, (68) <I>and</I> through him the wild animal is captured in the trap. 69. The proprietor <I>and</I> orchard-owner, who is the arranger of the trap, is aware through sagacity that the wild animal is powerful, <I>and</I> to what extent and how long a time. 70. The power and strength of that wild animal, which are in its body, are exhausted and poured <I>out</I> by struggling, as much as it is able, in demolishing the trap and <I>in</I> endeavouring to destroy <I>and</I> spoil the springe. 71. And when, on account of imperfect strength, its power of struggling totters <I>and</I> is exhausted, that wise gardener then, by his own will and his own result of determination, wisely throws that wild animal out of the trap, with <I>its</I> existing nature <I>and</I> exhausted strength. 72. And</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A></p>  
<p>he consigns his own trap and springe, rearranged <I>and</I> undamaged, back to the storehouse.</p>  
<p>73. Even like him is the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, who is the preserver of creations and arranger of creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_693"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the disabler of the evil original evolution&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_694"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and protector of his own orchard from the injurer. 74. The mischievous wild animal, which is the spoiler of the orchard, is that accursed Aharman who is the hurrier <I>and</I> disturber of the creatures. 75. The good trap is the sky, in which the good creations are lodging, (76) <I>and</I> in which the evil spirit and <I>his</I> rudimentary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_695"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> miscreations are captured. 77. And <I>pertaining</I> to the springe and trap of the wild animal, who is mischievous owing to his own wilfulness, is the exhauster (78) time that, for the struggling of Aharman and his powers <I>and</I> resources, is for the long period&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_696"></A><A HREF="#fn_688"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> (79) which, through the struggling of the wild animal in the springe and trap, is an exhaustion of its strength. 80. The sole&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_697"></A><A HREF="#fn_689"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<p>creator of the creatures arranges a preservation again, which is the preparation of an eternal happy progress <I>free</I> from his adversary, which that wise orchard-owner <I>does with</I> his own trap and springe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_698"></A><A HREF="#fn_690"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>81. Then&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_699"></A><A HREF="#fn_691"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the scanty power and want of ability of that fiend for it, in his struggling for the luminaries, are manifest even from this. 82. When as with lying falsehood he thought thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_700"></A><A HREF="#fn_692"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: 'I <I>will</I> make this sky and earth and the creatures of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> extinct, or I <I>will</I> turn <I>them</I> from their own nature <I>and</I> bring <I>them</I> to my own,' (83) even then, with <I>all</I> the power, desire of destruction, and perpetual struggling of the fiend, no slaughter whatever <I>by</I> the demons is <I>free</I> from effectual limits; it is this earth and sky, and these creatures, (84) <I>that</I> are propagating from few to many, as is manifest, (85) and innumerable <I>persons</I> are convinced of it. 86. For, if in this struggling any victory should have specially occurred, it would have been impossible to attain from few to many.</p>  
<p>87. Moreover, if the births of the worldly <I>existence</I> are mostly manifest through the occurrence of death therein, even then it is seen that that death is not a complete dissolution of existence, but a necessity of <I>going</I> from place to place, from duty to duty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_701"></A><A HREF="#fn_693"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 88. For, as the existence of all these creations is <I>derived</I> from the four elements, <I>it</I> is manifest to the sight <I>that</I> those worldly bodies of theirs are to be mingled again with the four elements. 89. The spiritual <I>parts</I>, which are the rudimentary appliances of the life</p>

<p>stimulating the body, are mingled with the soul&#151;(90) on account of unity of nature they are not dispersed&#151;(91) and the soul is accountable (am&acirc;rh&ocirc;mand) for its own deeds. 92. Its treasurers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_702"></A><A HREF="#fn_694"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, also, unto whom its good works and offences are intrusted, advance there for a contest. 93. When the treasurer of the good works is of greater strength, she preserves it, by her victory, from the hands of the accuser&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_703"></A><A HREF="#fn_695"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> settles <I>it</I> for the great throne and the mutual delightfulness of the luminaries; (94) and it is assisted eternally in virtuous progress. 95. And when the treasurer of its offences is of greater strength, it is dragged, through her victory, <I>away</I> from the hands of the helper&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_704"></A><A HREF="#fn_696"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, (96) <I>and</I> is delivered up to the place of thirst and hunger and the agonizing abode of disease&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_705"></A><A HREF="#fn_697"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 97. And, even there, those feeble good works, which <I>were</I> practised by it in the worldly <I>existence</I>, are not useless to it; (98) for, owing to <I>this</I> same reason, that hunger and thirst and punishment are <I>inflicted</I> on it proportionately to the sin, <I>and</I> not lawlessly, (99) because <I>there</I> is a watcher&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_706"></A><A HREF="#fn_698"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<p>of the infliction of its punishment. 100. And, ultimately, the compassionate creator, who is the forgiver of the creatures, does not leave any good creature captive in the hands of the enemy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_707"></A><A HREF="#fn_699"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 101. <I>But</I>, one day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_708"></A><A HREF="#fn_700"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he saves even those who are sinful, <I>and</I> those of the righteous through atonement for sin, by the hands of the purifiers, <I>and</I> makes <I>them</I> proceed on the happy course which is eternal.</p>  
<p>102. The conclusion is this, that the creator is the healer and perfect ruler, the maintainer and nourisher, protecting <I>and</I> preserving the creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_709"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; not a producer of the disease, a causer of the pain, and an inflicter of the punishment of his own creatures. 103. And it is more explicitly written below, with the arrangement of the two original evolutions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_710"></A><A HREF="#fn_702"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, among the assertors of the non-existence of a sacred being&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_711"></A><A HREF="#fn_703"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and the contemplators of unity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_712"></A><A HREF="#fn_704"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>104. As ordered and requested by you it is provided (padar&acirc;st); do you direct and observe <I>it</I> with kind regards. 105. Because, as written above&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_713"></A><A HREF="#fn_705"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> by us, I do not hold the station of teaching, but really that of learning. 106. Even this teaching of doctrines is that which <I>was</I> obtained by me, through the religion of wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_714"></A><A HREF="#fn_706"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, from the writing (nip&icirc;k) of &Acirc;t&ucirc;r-p&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;y&acirc;vand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_715"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>, and is here indicated. 107.

It is possible that Muhammadanism is alluded to, as that religion is hardly ever mentioned by name in Pahlavi writings, probably from motives of policy.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_657"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_665">128:1</A> Av. gadha, a term for 'a brigand' which is used in conjunction with witches and other evil beings in the Sr&ocirc;sh Yt. H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht, 5, 6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_658"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_666">128:2</A> Supposing that the P&acirc;z. frawast (fravast in &sect; 16) stands for Pahl. parvast, as in Chaps. VIII, 96, 97, XIV, 73, XVI, 56, 60, 66-69, 71, 72; but as N&ecirc;r. uses Sans. prasarpita, pravish<I>t</I>a, pravartita, samudgata, and samutpatita to translate the word, he must have assumed that it stood for fra<I>z</I>ast (Pahl. fra<I>g</I>ast, 'sprang forth').</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_659"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_667">129:1</A> Sans. 'will retreat,' as if N&ecirc;r. understood the pronoun 'his' to refer to the good spirit, instead of the evil one; the application of the pronouns in &sect;&sect; 14, 15 being by no means clear in the original text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_660"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_668">129:2</A> The spiritual representatives of the luminaries, who are angels.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_661"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_669">129:3</A> The words in brackets are omitted in AK, PB3, L23, so that &sect;&sect; 17, 18, in those MSS., stand as follows:&#151;'Since the fiendish venom of the noxious creatures, that the four elements pertaining to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&#151;which are water, fire, earth, and air&#151;have not entangled, is just as though they (the creatures) came to the sky <I>and</I> spiritual <I>existence</I>.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_669"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_677">131:4</A> This epithet is often applied to Hapt&ocirc;iring, Vanand, and Satav&ecirc;s.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_670"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_678">131:5</A> See Mkh. XLIX, 12-14.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_674"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_682">131:9</A> Or it may be 'planetary-opposing,' or 'north-accepting.' The dislocation, and probable corruption, of these sections is due to N&ecirc;r., who evidently considered the epithet mazdadh&acirc;ta, 'created by Mazda,' as the name of one of the constellations, and 'great' and 'supreme' as mere epithets of Hapt&ocirc;iring. But he found it difficult to adapt the text to this opinion of his.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_675"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_683">131:10</A> These oppositions agree with those mentioned in Bd. V, 1, except that Hapt&ocirc;iring is there opposed to Mars, and Vanand to Jupiter.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_676"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_684">132:1</A> Referring to the supposed cause of eclipses, which are said to be occasioned by two dark bodies revolving below the sun and moon, so as to pass between them and the earth whenever an eclipse occurs (see Dd. LXIX).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_677"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_685">132:2</A> Referring to the supposed injurious influence of comets which, as they usually appear one at a time to the unassisted eye, are here assumed to be a single evil being, the M&ucirc;<I>s</I>par of Bd. V, 1, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_678"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_686">132:3</A> We should perhaps say 'she,' as a dr&ucirc;<I>g</I>, 'fiend,' is usually considered to be a female being, and the M&ucirc;<I>s</I>par or M&ucirc;<I>s</I>-pairika is a witch.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_679"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_687">133:1</A> Meaning, probably, the reason given by the astrologers for the good works mentioned in &sect; 28.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_680"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_688">133:2</A> The demon of thunder (see Bd. VII, 12).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_681"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_689">133:3</A> The lightning (see Bd. XVII, 1).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_682"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_690">133:4</A> The demon of drought (see Bd. VII, 8, 10, 12, XXVIII, 39). These two conflicts represent the struggle between rain and drought, which culminates in the thunderstorm; T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar (Sirius) being the bringer of rain.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_683"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_691">133:5</A> So in AK, PB3, MH19, but other MSS. have m&acirc;r, 'serpent,' instead of mar, though N&ecirc;r. uses Sans. n<I>ri</I><I>s</I>a<I>m</I>sa.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_684"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_692">133:6</A> Which is manifest in the world around us.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_686"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_694">135:2</A> Reading b&ucirc;n ga<I>s</I>tak instead of b&ucirc;n ya<I>s</I>tak, as the word has evidently no reference to any form of worship. It cannot be translated 'original perversion' (a possible meaning of the word) because there are two of them (see &sect; 103 and Chap. VIII, 101), one competing with the other (see Chap. VIII, 1), which, as one of them is here said to be evil, implies that the other is good and cannot, therefore, be a perversion; nor would this term be applicable in Chap. VI, 6 or XV, 56.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_687"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_695">135:3</A> Or it may be 'primitive,' as k&acirc;dmon is the Huzv&acirc;ri<I>s</I> form of the P&acirc;z. kh&acirc;mast (superlative of Pers. &#145;<I>h</I>&acirc;m, 'immature') here used.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_688"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_696">135:4</A> So in all the older MSS., but in Sans. it '<I>is</I> the long-time lord,' a common Avesta epithet of 'time,' and this alteration has been introduced into JE, R, and a few other modern MSS.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_689"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_697">135:5</A> Assuming that P&acirc;z. aw&acirc;<I>z</I> stands for <I>e</I>w&acirc;<I>z</I>. The word is omitted by Sans., K28, L15.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_690"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_698">136:1</A> As stated in &sect; 72.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_691"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_699">136:2</A> Reading ad&icirc;na<I>s</I>, 'then for it,' which is the original Pahlavi indicated by the P&acirc;z. ain&acirc; of N&ecirc;r. (see Mkh. IX, 6 n).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_692"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_700">136:3</A> See &sect; 12.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_693"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_701">136:4</A> Compare Chap. XII, 79.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_694"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_702">137:1</A> N&ecirc;r. divides the word gan<I>g</I>&ocirc;bar, 'treasurer,' into the three words gan<I>g</I> u bar, 'treasure and produce.' These treasurers are the female spirits who meet the soul after death, with its stores of good works and sins (see Dd. XXIV, 5, XXV, 5), and symbolize its good and bad conscience, represented by a beautiful maiden and a frightful hag, respectively.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_695"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_703">137:2</A> The accuser is any person or thing of the good creation that has been injured by any sin, and who must be satisfied by atonement before the sin can be remitted. The question, therefore, to be settled, when the account of the soul is rendered, is whether its good works are sufficient to atone for its sins. In this case the treasurer of offences represents the accusers.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_696"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_704">137:3</A> The treasurer of good works.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_697"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_705">137:4</A> That is, to the torments of hell.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_698"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_706">137:5</A> Either the treasurer of its good works, or the good works themselves.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_699"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_707">138:1</A> Compare Chap. XII, 59.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_706"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_714">138:8</A> It is doubtful whether this d&icirc;ni-i-khard was the name of a book now unknown, as the phrase admits of reasonable translation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_707"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_715">138:9</A> This writer is also mentioned in Chaps. I, 38, IX, 2, X, 52, but his name has not yet been found elsewhere. As he does not <A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A> appear to be mentioned in that portion of the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I> known to be extant, his writings were probably embodied in the first two books of that work, which have not yet been discovered.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_708"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_716">139:1</A> The most extensive Pahlavi work in existence, of which only Books III-IX are extant; they contain about 170,000 words and are a summary of the religious opinions, customs, legends, and literature of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers, compiled probably in or before the eighth century of the Christian era from earlier records.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_709"></A><A HREF="sbe24074.htm#fr_717">139:2</A> An early editor of the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I>, 'acts of the religion.' His selections from various religious writings form the fourth and fifth books of that work. He appears to have been succeeded in the editorship by his son Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t.
