### AUTHOR'S PREFACE

ZOROASTRIANISM is a religion much commented upon by a few enthusiastic
oriental scholars, and less understood by the general public. Out of the
millions of believers of this faith in the bygone ages, there now
remains a handful of devout followers, known as the Parsis. I have,
therefore, ventured to put before my readers a brief sketch of the
teachings of this divine prophet. I hope, that the strangers to the
faith may find in it food for philosophic enlightenment, and the
Zoroastrians themselves a subject for deeper and wider researches in the
untold wealth of sublime theology and philosophy, now looked up in the
monumental tomes of the ancient Avesta writings.

For extracts in this volume, I am greatly indebted, amongst others, to
the works of the following eminent oriental scholars: Dr. Martin Haug,
Dr. E. W. West, Dr. L. H. Mills, Professors

I have also to thank the India Office authorities for their kindness in
placing at my disposal their splendid library of the Persian and Zend
literature, and my old friend Sir C. Purdon Clarke, the Director of the
Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington, for his valuable
suggestions regarding the ancient print of Zoroaster, which appears on
the cover of this book, and my friend Mr. A. Kapadia, of Lincoln's Inn,
for his kind assistance.
