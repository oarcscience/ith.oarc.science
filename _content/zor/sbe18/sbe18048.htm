<p>1. <I>As to</I> the fortieth question and reply, that which you ask is thus: Of those whose decision is this, that it is not necessary to be steadfast in the religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers--by <I>which</I> decision this is asserted, <I>that</I> they should abandon the religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers--<I>some one</I> disparages the religion <I>and</I> goes over to a foreign faith (an-a&icirc;r&icirc;h), then of what nature is his sin</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A></p>  
<p>owing thereto, <I>and</I> what does the sin owing thereto, as regards those of the same foreign religion, amount to? 2. Or order <I>some one</I> then to tell us clearly concerning it, how it is, and how is the disobedience due to this sin.</p>  
<p>3. The reply is this, that an adult is worthy of death&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> on account of the good religion they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> would abandon, on account also of the adopted law of the foreign faith <I>he</I> is worthy of death, in whose reliance upon the improper law is also the sin which they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> maintain <I>and</I> practise by law, and through <I>being</I> in the same law <I>he</I> is equally sinful with them. 4. And also when any one is on that course, and his wish is <I>for</I> the same protection, of which a similitude is <I>in</I> the enduring words of that good law they would forsake, and he adopts that which is vile&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, even through that impropriety <I>he</I> is equally sinful.</p>  
<p>5. When he dies, without renunciation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> <I>of that sin</I> and impenitently, in that improperly-constituted law, the position of his soul is then in the worst</p>

<p>existence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and his punishment is that of many <I>sins</I> worthy of death; from the demons also <I>there</I> come grievously, hand in hand, pain and suffering, gnawing and stench of many kinds, stinging, tearing, and lacerating, primary evil and discomfort. 6. And through their&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> law and faith his distress in that worst existence is thus until the last change of existence, when the renovation <I>of the universe</I> is produced by will among living beings.</p>  
<p>7. But reality (a&icirc;t&#335;&icirc;h), as regards living, arises from renunciation of that disobedience; it makes those attract to the good law who seduced him to that evil law, that which established him improperly in the law it eradicates from <I>his</I> conduct (r&ucirc;b&acirc;k&icirc;h), advancing sins it again restrains, and whatever <I>has</I> advanced it repairs again anew through the religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers, <I>and</I> he becomes thoughtful, constant, and steadfast. 8. The sin which he set going he restrains and atones for by wealth, trouble, and authorising&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> commands; even in the body he also undergoes punishment in the three <I>nights</I> (sat&ucirc;&icirc;h)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_514"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; he then obtains forgiveness, and his soul is saved.</p>  
<p>9. And as <I>it</I> is said in the persistent law of the sacred beings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, that 'the good religion of the sacred beings, who are the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshipping superiors,</p>

<p>ordains <I>it</I> as retribution,' so that the sin it takes away (spay&ecirc;iti)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> may not exist in him, his retribution is declared by revelation. 10. And by the same witness <I>it</I> is said, that all of the primitive faith have been quite of the same opinion about this, that from the good religion except by&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the way of renunciation <I>of sin</I> there is none unless to hell; but that renunciation <I>should</I> be during life, for it is said that 'whoever <I>when</I> living does not become righteous, that is, does not fully atone for sin, <I>for</I> him <I>when</I> dead <I>there</I> is no grant of&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the best existence.' 11. To commit no sin is better than retribution <I>and</I> renunciation of sin.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_507"></A><A HREF="sbe18048.htm#fr_509">137:4</A> The probable meaning is that if he conforms to the foreign faith merely from politic motives, while retaining a belief in his own religion, he is still equally sinful.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_508"></A><A HREF="sbe18048.htm#fr_510">137:5</A> This renunciation is effected by the recitation of a particular formula called the Patit, in which every imaginable sin is mentioned with a declaration of repentance of any such sins as the reciter may have committed. But this formal renunciation must. be accompanied by atonement and true repentance; and in order to ascertain the proper atonement all serious sins must be confessed to the high-priest (see Sls. IV, 14, VIII, 1, 2, 8-10).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_512"></A><A HREF="sbe18048.htm#fr_514">138:4</A> Referring to the three nights' punishment after the resurrection of the body, which is specially reserved for mortal sinners (see Bd. XXX, 10).</P>
