<p>1. The fourth question is that which you ask thus: Of this destruction (za<I>d</I>am) and terror which ever happen to us from the retribution&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the period, and are a cause of the other evils and defects of the good religion, what kind of opinion exists? And 'is there a good opinion of us among the spirits, or not?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that it is said in the revelation of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers that the impediments (r&acirc;s-band&icirc;h), through which <I>there</I> is vexation in righteousness, are because its doctrine is this, that, regarding the difficulty, anxiety, and discomfort which occur through good works set going, it is not desirable to account <I>them</I> as much difficulty, trouble, and discomfort. 3. Whereas it is not desirable to account <I>them</I> as anxiety and difficulty, it is then declared by it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> thereof, that, as its recompense, so much comfort <I>and</I> pleasure will come to the soul, as that no one is to think of that difficulty and discomfort which came upon him through so many such good works, because he is steadfast to maintain the good religion, and utters thanksgivings (va st&acirc;ye<I>d</I>&#335;). 4. And as regards the discomfort&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, which the same good religion of ours <I>has</I> had, it comes on from the opponents of the religion.</p>

<p>5. Through the coming, of religion we have full enjoyment (ba<I>r</I>&acirc; g&ucirc;k&acirc;r&ecirc;m), and owing. to religion, unlike bondsmen (ab&ucirc;r<I>d</I>&#335;g&acirc;nv&acirc;r), we do not become changeable among the angels; our spiritual life (ahv&ocirc;&icirc;h) of praise then arrives in readiness, and owing to the angels <I>there</I> are joyous salutation, spiritual life, and glory for the soul.</p>
