<p>1. <I>As to</I> the eighty-fifth question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: What is possible to become the harm of a gift <I>that</I> is reduced?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that since <I>those things</I> are to be properly given which are for the religious rites of the ceremonial&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and are the consideration of the undertakers of all the religious rites, and are also the stipend of some solemnizers, both&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_934"></A><A HREF="#fn_931"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are living comfortably <I>by</I> the ceremonial. 3. The sons of the disciples <I>who</I> wanted approval for the words prayed, become so much the more to be ordered <I>and</I> to be accepted; and the ceremonial of all the religious rites becomes more progressive.</p>  
<p>4. So, moreover, when they go to undertake the well-operating activity of the ceremonial for a diminution of remuneration <I>and</I> gift, and owing to undertaking <I>and</I> ordering again&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_935"></A><A HREF="#fn_932"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, by way of routine (pavan d&ocirc;r r&acirc;s), they do not request so much stipend, <I>it is</I> as though they should buy my linen <I>and</I> should sell <I>it</I> again for their own payment (d&acirc;<I>d</I>an&#335;). 5. <I>As to</I> the performers of the ceremonial, likewise, who <I>have</I> to acquire approval with much trouble and words prayed, and obtain a remuneration which, <I>for</I> the soul even, is as little for the ceremonial as though <I>one were</I> annoyed--whereby</p>

<p>living is difficult--they become sorry for enduring the trouble, owing to lukewarmness (afsur<I>d</I>&#335;-mini<I>s</I>n&icirc;h) <I>in</I> the same profession. 6. And even the sons of the disciples shall sell linen for wages, and they rejoice <I>that</I> it is possible to learn other callings <I>with</I> less pains; and thus they make <I>them</I> become lukewarm <I>and</I> meditating retreat (a<I>v</I>&acirc;<I>z</I>&acirc;hang) from the words of fresh paragraphs continually prayed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_936"></A><A HREF="#fn_933"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, from the approval requested of the learned (&acirc;<I>z</I>&acirc;n), <I>and</I> from all the religious rites they should undertake <I>for</I> the contented.</p>  
<p>7. <I>As to</I> those, moreover, who, through fervent-minded undertaking of <I>what</I> is ordered, request less <I>for</I> all the religious rites, <I>and have</I> not obtained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_937"></A><A HREF="#fn_934"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> even that which is due <I>to them</I>, it is not even as though they ordered <I>of them</I> for the fiends&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_938"></A><A HREF="#fn_935"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 8. And the disgrace, too, of the orderers of good works of lukewarmness is the exaltation of the profession of the disciples; and its deficient progress becomes the paralysation of the ceremonial of the sacred beings for saving the souls of the good from the deadly <I>one</I> (mar).</p>
