<p>1. <I>As to</I> the eighty-eighth question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: When a man resolves within himself thus: '<I>In</I> the summer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_956"></A><A HREF="#fn_953"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> time I <I>will</I> go into P&acirc;rs, and will give so much money for the high-priesthood, on account of the fires <I>and</I> other matters which are as greatly advantageous,' though he himself does not come into P&acirc;rs, <I>but</I> sends the money according to his intention, <I>or</I> in excess of it, unto the high-priests--so that he is like the great <I>who</I> send in excess of that unto the high-priests&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_957"></A><A HREF="#fn_954"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>--that, as the benefit is greater which is more maintained, they may provide for the fires of every kind <I>and</I> other matters, is then his proceeding of sending to P&acirc;rs, for that purpose, a sin, or not?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that if his coming be indispensable for the design he would undertake, then it is indispensable for him to accomplish his own mental undertaking; but in suffering which is excited <I>and</I> not avoidable, when <I>there</I> is really no possibility</p>

<p>of his travelling himself, any one whom he sends in his place, more particularly on <I>that</I> account, is not acceptable by the approval of the angels who <I>have</I> realized the affliction in <I>his</I> good thought, but the good work is to be eagerly well-considered. 3. Good gifts, and every office (g&acirc;s) about good works which it is possible to perform, are what are commendable <I>in</I> the well-housed <I>man</I> that is not able to work <I>himself</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_958"></A><A HREF="#fn_955"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><I>; they are</I> avoidable by him when not of good race, and are not indispensable for him whenever the good work is not announced. 4. When able to manage <I>it</I> himself <I>it</I> is better; and when otherwise, his appointment of a faithful <I>person</I> over <I>its</I> preparation, and <I>his</I> accomplishment of the work of selector are expedient.</p>
