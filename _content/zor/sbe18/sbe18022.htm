<p>1. The thirteenth question is that which you ask thus: 'Who should prepare the account of the soul as to sin and good works, and in what place should they make it up? <I>And</I> when punishment is inflicted by them, where is their place then?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that the account about the doers of actions, as to good works <I>and</I> sin, three times every day whilst the doer of the actions is living, Voh&ucirc;man the archangel should prepare; because taking account of the thoughts, words, and deeds of all material existences is among his duties. 3. And about the sin which <I>affects</I> accusers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_87"></A><A HREF="sbe18022.htm#fr_88">32:1</A> Sins are divided into two classes, ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l&acirc;n or those which affect 'accusers,' and r&ucirc;b&acirc;n&icirc;k or those which affect only one's own soul. In the first class are included all evil actions which injure our fellow-creatures or any good animal or thing, and for which the injured party (the 'accuser') must receive satisfaction before the sinner can be pardoned (see Sls. VIII, I).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_88"></A><A HREF="sbe18022.htm#fr_89">33:1</A> The angel of the sun's light; he is a personification of friendship and good faith, and is, therefore, specially aggrieved by breaches of promise and fraudulent debtors, but assists righteous souls in their passage to the other world (see AV. V, 3, Mkh. II, 118).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_89"></A><A HREF="sbe18022.htm#fr_90">33:2</A> Referring to debts and promises to pay.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_90"></A><A HREF="sbe18022.htm#fr_91">33:3</A> The angels of obedience and justice; the duty of the former is to protect the righteous, and that of the latter is to weigh the good works and sins in his golden scales, when the soul's account is balanced after the third night after death (see AV. V, 2-5, Mkh. II, 115-122).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_91"></A><A HREF="sbe18022.htm#fr_92">33:4</A> Referring, perhaps, to the future temporary separation of the wicked from the righteous, after the assembly of the Sa<I>d</I>v&acirc;star&acirc;n (see Bd. XXX, 10-16).</P>
