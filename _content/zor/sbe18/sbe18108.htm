<p>1. And <I>as to</I> that which is written&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1182"></A><A HREF="#fn_1178"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, that 'in the teaching of Afarg <I>it</I> is thus declared, that "for every single person, at the least&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1183"></A><A HREF="#fn_1179"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, one cup of water <I>and</I>&nbsp;</p>

<p>one cup of bull's urine, which are well alike (v&ecirc;hm&acirc;l)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1184"></A><A HREF="#fn_1180"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, are requisite;" <I>and in</I> the same manner it is said in the teaching of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h, that "the water and bull's urine, when it is possible, are all to be thoroughly consecrated; when not--and, at the lowest, one cup of water and one cup of bull's urine, which are well alike, for every single person--<I>they</I> are to be set down <I>in</I> that place, and are afterwards to be mingled together&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1185"></A><A HREF="#fn_1181"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>." 2. And since two teachings have so stated, are <I>we</I> to perform the operation more preservatively&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1186"></A><A HREF="#fn_1182"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and according to a more correct opinion than this?'</p>  
<p>3. Also, 'a correct apportionment is not understood by us, and clear reasons <I>have</I> not come to <I>our</I> knowledge that a less measure of the thing is proper.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1187"></A><A HREF="#fn_1183"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. But I well imagine (h&ucirc;-minam) this. is not the operation of the <I>purifying</I> cup (t&acirc;<I>s</I>t&icirc;k&#335;), where a less thing is not proper, because the information with which they have existed--owing to that information of theirs, of which a former high-priest and deliberator <I>was</I> the communicator--is that which <I>was</I> heard by me, that there are <I>some</I> who, for the sake of diminishing the measure <I>of</I> water <I>and</I> bull's urine, speak of this apportionment thus: 'V&icirc;<I>k</I>ithr<I>e</I><I>k</I>i<I>d</I>', in everything the operation</p>

<p><A NAME="page_306"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 306</FONT></A></p>  
<p>which accomplishes this, that is, when <I>there is</I> as much as is discernible from his body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1188"></A><A HREF="#fn_1184"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is proper.' 5. And the saying is not perceived by me <I>as</I> a correct apportioning, because the judgment of the greatly-learned leader of those of the good religion, the glorified Y&ucirc;d&acirc;n-Yim&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1189"></A><A HREF="#fn_1185"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and of other deliberators, the opinion of good thinkers, was thus, that that saying is spoken about that of which the measure is not declared as the least by the high-priests' teaching of revelation. 6. Finally, when it is really of the same origin <I>and</I> suitable, then less than the least of that, of which the measure is declared as the least, is not proper, if, owing to much evidence in the teaching which has mentioned <I>it</I> as suitable, <I>it be</I> more of a blessing, and the operation performed thereby <I>be</I> more legitimate; because that teaching is for confessing that the statements of high-priests are most evidence of the practice.</p>  
<p>7. This is that which is equally perpetual: it is very important <I>for</I> the purifiers to keep the intellect of life in operation, <I>and for</I> the good to become mentally a powerful giver of aid to them; and now, too, a purifier is ordered to keep in use his own most universal equal measure. 8. That which is perceived by me, and <I>has</I> come to my knowledge, more particularly when washed by myself, is the keeping in use an equal measure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1190"></A><A HREF="#fn_1186"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 9. And even if there be a purifier who does not completely keep in use the</p>

<p>consecrated water and bull's urine, still then <I>it</I> is not worse than when it does not really arise <I>from</I> the same origin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1191"></A><A HREF="#fn_1187"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and its religious rite also does not take place.</p>  
<p>10. Also the words of both the solemnization of the Vendid&acirc;<I>d</I> and the recitation of the Avesta are likewise to be uttered by him; because&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1192"></A><A HREF="#fn_1188"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> 'Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t enquired of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> <I>about</I> it thus: "How <I>shall</I> I purify&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1193"></A><A HREF="#fn_1189"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> where he does not attain unto the Airy<I>e</I>m&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1194"></A><A HREF="#fn_1190"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>--there are <I>some</I> who say <I>where</I> everything is anus&ocirc; ('discontented')&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1195"></A><A HREF="#fn_1191"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>? 11. How as to the fire, how as to the water, how as to the earth, how as to animals, how as to plants, how as to the righteous man, how as to the righteous woman, how as to the stars, how as to the moon, how as to the sun, how as to the endless light, how as to the independent light&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1196"></A><A HREF="#fn_1192"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, how as to all the prosperity, created by</p>

And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke to him thus: "Thou shalt chant the purification <I>liturgy</I>, O Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t!--that is, fully solemnize a Vendid&acirc;<I>d</I> <I>service</I>--then he becomes purified, &amp;c.,"' as mentioned by me <I>above</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1198"></A><A HREF="#fn_1194"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 13. Where they do not make <I>them</I> solemnize a Vendid&acirc;<I>d</I> so that they keep in operation that which is written of it as a rite, this does not drive <I>pollution</I> from any <I>one</I>; and then, too, they should abandon the commands of a decree of leaders who are not over <I>them</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1199"></A><A HREF="#fn_1195"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>14. Keep the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1200"></A><A HREF="#fn_1196"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in operation, so that the consecrated water and bull's urine are in the proportion <I>which</I> is taught by the high-priests of the religion, unless a scarcity occurs as regards these. 15. Then <I>together</I> with it, also, this is <I>to be observed</I>, that what is mentioned in two teachings is certainly more correct; afterwards, too, where a possibility for it is not obtained by them, <I>there</I> is <I>what</I> is mentioned as suitable by one teaching, and I do not decide <I>that it</I> is not an expediency.</p>  
<p>16. And <I>as to</I> that, also, <I>which</I> is written concerning the three hundred pebbles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1201"></A><A HREF="#fn_1197"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> that, sprinkled</p>

<p>in <I>ceremonial</I> ablution (p&acirc;<I>d</I>y&acirc;<I>v</I>&#335;), are cast into (va<I>l</I>) the bull's urine and water, that is taught even <I>in</I> the same manner; the <I>inward</I> prayer (v&acirc;<I>g</I>&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1202"></A><A HREF="#fn_1198"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, even for when <I>one</I> does not cast <I>them</I>, is in the existing teaching, which is proper. 17. Then, too, on account of the cheapness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1203"></A><A HREF="#fn_1199"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and harmlessness of the pebbles the purifiers are less curtailing as to them, <I>and</I> to drink the thing so is well-curative in performance. 18. In the existing teaching of imperfect purifiers it should be very advantageous to maintain it as easy; moreover, it is not said of it <I>that it</I> is not suitable, and in the teaching of Afarg it is said that it is proper.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1176"></A><A HREF="sbe18107.htm#fr_1180">304:2</A> Reading p&ecirc;sm&acirc;l, as equivalent to the p&ecirc;<I>s</I>m&acirc;l or p&ecirc;<I>s</I>&icirc;mal previously used; but the word can also be read pas&icirc;mal, 'after deponent,' which would be inconsistent with the context. The two terms are very liable to be confounded in writing Pahlavi, and in Ep. II, ii, 6 they are again written alike, though put in opposition to each other. The 'prior deponent' is Afarg.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1177"></A><A HREF="sbe18107.htm#fr_1181">304:3</A> That is, 'about this one time,' as J has it.</P>

Vend. IX, 132, <i>c</i> the phrase is pavan kamist&icirc;h, which can mean only 'at the minimum, or least.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1180"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1184">305:1</A> In Pahl. Vend.

<P><A NAME="fn_1183"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1187">305:4</A> This word, which probably means 'in whatever is varied,' was <A NAME="page_306"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 306</FONT></A> evidently the beginning of an Avesta phrase whose Pahlavi translation concludes the sentence. The phrase does not appear to be extant elsewhere.</P>

This section is omitted in J, probably by mistake.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1187"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1191">307:1</A> Apparently deprecating the use of mingled liquids derived from various sources.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1188"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1192">307:2</A> The passage quoted here is from Pahl. Vend. XI, 1-6, with a few variations.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1189"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1193">307:3</A> Pahl. Vend. inserts 'as to the abode.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1190"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1194">307:4</A> The Airy<I>e</I>m&acirc; (written Airy&ecirc;m&ecirc; in the MSS.) is Yas. LIII, which commences with the words '&acirc; airy<I>e</I>m&acirc; ishy&ocirc;,' and is the last of the G&acirc;tha spells mentioned, in Vend. X, 22, as having to be recited four times in order to exorcise the fiend. The meaning of the question in the text, therefore, is: how is the purification to be effected when all the spells are not recited?</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1191"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1195">307:5</A> Referring to Vend. IX, 161--163 (see Chap. IV, 3).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1192"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1196">307:6</A> This clause is omitted in Pahl. Vend., being merely a repetition of the preceding one, the Av. anaghra rao<I>k</I><I>a</I>u being first translated by asarag r&ocirc;shan&#335;&icirc;h, and then partially transliterated by <A NAME="page_308"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 308</FONT></A> anagrag r&#335;shan&#335;. As sar means 'head, end' in Pahlavi (hardly ever 'beginning'), the only meaning common to the two terms asarag and anagrag seems to be 'without a head or superior, independent,' that is, in this case, independent of the light of other luminaries.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1193"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1197">308:1</A> K35 has 'righteousness, created by A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>,' but this is evidently a mistake, as 'righteousness' does not translate the original Av. voh&ucirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1194"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1198">308:2</A> That is, as to the fire, &amp;c. mentioned in &sect; 11.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1195"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1199">308:3</A> Referring to the heretical decree about which he is writing.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1196"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1200">308:4</A> See App. IV.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1197"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1201">308:5</A> See also Ep. II, iii, 12. The word generally used in these <A NAME="page_309"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 309</FONT></A> epistles is sang, 'stone,' but Chap. IX, 6 has sag&icirc;<I>k</I>ak&#335;, and Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, <i>c</i> mentions sag<I>k</I>ak, 'a pebble,' as being cast into (d&ecirc;n) the consecrated water and bull's urine, without specifying any number. The practice appears not to be mentioned in the Persian Riv&acirc;yats, and seems now obsolete; the addition of a small quantity of the ashes of the sacred fire to the bull's urine, which is tasted at the beginning of the rite, is, however, mentioned in the Riv&acirc;yats.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1198"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1202">309:1</A> See Dd. LXXIX, 2. The prayer or grace has to be taken inwardly, that is, murmured, before the drinking mentioned in &sect; 17. According to this text provision seems to have been made for not using the pebbles, by means of a special prayer.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1199"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fr_1203">309:2</A> Or 'value,' as ar<I>g</I>&acirc;n&icirc;h means both.</P>
