<p>1. <I>As to</I> the sixty-fourth question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: Where <I>and</I> from what did the origin of race, <I>which</I> they say <I>was</I> next-of-kin marriage (khv&ecirc;t&ucirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I>&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_737"></A><A HREF="#fn_734"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, arise; and from what place did it arise?</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_200"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 200</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that the first consummation of next-of-kin marriage was owing to that <I>which</I> Mashy&acirc;&icirc;h <I>and</I> Mashy&acirc;y&ocirc;&icirc;h&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_738"></A><A HREF="#fn_735"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> did, who were brother and sister together, and their consummation of intercourse produced a son&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_739"></A><A HREF="#fn_736"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> as a consummation of the first next-of-kin marriage. 3. So that they effected the first intercourse of man with woman, <I>and</I> the entire progress of the races of every kind of lineage of men arose from that, <I>and</I> all the men <I>of</I> the world are of that race.</p>  
<p>4. It is truly said, that it was the joy of the lord <I>and</I> creator after the creation of the creatures, and, owing to that, its consummation, which <I>was</I> his complete accomplishment of the existence of the creatures (d&acirc;m&acirc;n&icirc;h), was owing to him. 5. And its occurrence, too, is in evidence that the creator, who is so with unflinching (at&ocirc;r&acirc;k) will, is as much <I>the cause of</I> the begetting and entire progress of his own perfect creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_740"></A><A HREF="#fn_737"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, in whom begetting is by destiny, as H&ocirc;sh&acirc;ng&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_741"></A><A HREF="#fn_738"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> by whom two-thirds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_742"></A><A HREF="#fn_739"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of the demons <I>were</I> smitten, T&acirc;khm&ocirc;rup&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_743"></A><A HREF="#fn_740"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> who overturned Aharman through the power of the angels, Yim by</p>

It is a term applied to marriages between near relations, and is extolled as specially meritorious. For centuries past the Parsis have understood it to refer to marriages between first cousins, and all allusions to marriage between nearer relations they attribute to the practices of heretics (see Sls. XVIII, 4 n); though, like the professors of all other religions, they must admit the necessity of such a practice in the first family of mankind, as detailed in the text. Translations of other passages relating to the subject will be found in Appendix III, and it is also mentioned in Chaps. XXXVII, 82, LXXVII, 6, and LXXVIII, 19.</P>
