<p>1. The eighteenth question is that which you ask thus: When the souls of the righteous <I>and</I> the souls of the wicked go out to the spirits, will it then be possible for them to see A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> and Aharman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, or not?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that concerning Aharman it is said that his is no material existence (st&icirc;s); <I>and</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, as a spirit among the spirits, is to be heard by those who are material and those also who are spiritual, <I>but his</I> form (kerp&ocirc;) is not completely visible except through wisdom. 3. And a semblance of <I>his</I> power is seen, as <I>was</I> told unto Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t the Sp&icirc;tam&acirc;n when he saw the result (zah) of his handiwork, and he (A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>) spoke thus: 'Grasp the hand of a righteous man! for the kindly operation of my religion through&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> thee thyself is as</p>

<p>much as he shall grasp, and thou mayst see him whose reception (m&acirc;hm&acirc;n&icirc;h) of my wisdom and glory is the most.</p>  
<p>4. And about the souls of the righteous and wicked, in the spiritual places they see the throne (g&acirc;s), which they deem a sight of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>. 5. And so also those who are domiciled with (hamnem&acirc;n) Aharman, through that wisdom with reference to whose creator they shall suffer, will understand minutely as regards A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> and the nature of Aharman (Aharman&icirc;h). 6. And he who is of the righteous is delighted at escaping from Aharman <I>and</I> coming to the existence pertaining to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; and they shall offer homage to the glory&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>. 7. And he who is wicked, through being deceived by Aharman, and turning from the direction (pe<I>l</I>ag) of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, becomes more vexed <I>and</I> more penitent; the hope (zah&icirc;<I>s</I>n&#335;) and forgiveness which he possesses, and the retribution <I>and</I> manacling which are his among the fiends <I>and</I> spirits through his own handiwork, are <I>by</I> the permission which comes from the most persistent of the persistent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> at the period of the resurrection.</p>

The epithet khv&acirc;par, here translated 'persistent,' appears to mean 'self-sustaining' in the Avesta (see Sls. XXII, 21); traditionally it is supposed to mean 'protecting, cherishing,' but this is merely a guess, though it seems related to, Pers. khap&acirc;rah, 'active,' and may, therefore, often mean 'persevering.'</P>
