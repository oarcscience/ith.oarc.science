### CHAPTER XX.

1\. The nineteenth question is that you ask thus: To what place do the
righteous and wicked <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_127) go?

2\. The reply is this, that it is thus said that the souls of those
passed *away and* of the dead <span id="fr_129"></span>[2](#fn_128) are
three nights on earth; and the first night satisfaction comes to them
from *their* good thoughts *and* vexation from *their* evil thoughts,
the second night *come* pleasure from *their* good words and discomfort
*and* punishment <span id="fr_130"></span>[3](#fn_129) from *their* evil
words, and the third night *come* exaltation from *their* good deeds
*and* punishment from *their* evil deeds <span
id="fr_131"></span>[4](#fn_130). 3. And that third night, in the dawn,
they go to the place of account *on* Albûr*z* <span
id="fr_132"></span>[5](#fn_131); the account *being* rendered they
proceed to the bridge <span id="fr_133"></span>[6](#fn_132), and he who
is righteous

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

passes over the bridge on the ascent (lâlâîh), and if belonging to the
ever-stationary (hamîstânîkŏ) <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_133) he
goes thither where their place is, if *along* with an excess of good
works *his* habits are correct (frârûn-dâ*d*) *he goes* even unto heaven
(vahi*s*tô), and if *along* with an excess of good works *and* correct
habits *he has* chanted the sacred hymns (gâsânŏ) *he goes* even unto
the supreme heaven (garô*d*mânŏ). 4. He who is of the wicked falls from
the lower end (tîh) of the bridge, or from the middle of the bridge; he
falls head-foremost to hell, *and* is precipitated (nikûnî-aîtŏ) unto
that grade <span id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_134) which is *suitable for*
his wickedness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_127"></span>[46:1](sbe18028.htm#fr_128) As K35 inserts the
relative î here, some such phrase as 'who are dead' has probably dropped
out of the Pahlavi text.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[46:2](sbe18028.htm#fr_129) The Parsi books
speak of the righteous dead as 'departed,' a term very rarely applied to
the wicked (see Chap. XXXII, 4), who are nearly always said 'to die;'
the latter verb is, however, occasionally used when speaking of the
righteous. This distinction is made even in the Huzvâri*s* logograms,
which express the death of the righteous by forms allied to Chald. ‏ו
?Oֲ?Bַ?R‎ 'he passed over,' and the death of the wicked by forms allied
to Chald. ‏ו םִ?Y?Tה‎ 'he died.'

<span id="fn_129"></span>[46:3](sbe18028.htm#fr_130) So in all MSS., but
the 'punishment' seems superfluous here.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[46:4](sbe18028.htm#fr_131) The Avesta merely
states that the soul remains three nights near the body, chanting a
particular hymn, and experiencing as much pleasure or uneasiness as it
had in the world (see Hn. II, 3-17, III, 3-16); and much the same
account is given in AV. IV, 9-14, XVII, 2-9, Mkh. II, 114, 158-160.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[46:5](sbe18028.htm#fr_132) The mountain chain
which is supposed to surround the world (see Bd. XII, 3); the Av.
Hara-berezaiti.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[46:6](sbe18028.htm#fr_133) The *K*inva*d*
bridge (see Chap. XXI, 2-7), which is said to <span id="page_47">p.
47</span> rest upon the Dâîtih ('judicial') peak, and to 'pass over to
Albûr*z* (see Bd. XII, 7). According to the Avesta (Vend. XIX, 100, 101,
trans. D.) his conscience, in the form of a maiden, 'makes the soul of
the righteous one go up above the Hara-berezaiti (Albûr*z*); above the
*K*inva*d* bridge she places it in the presence of the heavenly gods
(angels) themselves.' See also AV. V, 1, 2, Mkh. II, 115.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[47:1](sbe18028.htm#fr_134) The intermediate
place for those not good enough for heaven and not bad enough for hell,
where such souls remain in a passive, immovable state till the
resurrection (see Sls. VI, 2). It is divided into two parts, according
to the author, one for those nearly righteous (see Chap. XXIV, 6), and
one for those nearly wicked (see Chap. XXXIII, 2).

<span id="fn_134"></span>[47:2](sbe18028.htm#fr_135) Four grades of
heaven and four of hell are mentioned in AV. and Mkh, (see Sls. VI, 3,
note).
