<p>1. <I>As to</I> the eighty-first question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: <I>As to</I> a man who shall order a ceremonial <I>and</I> shall give the money (diram), and the man who shall undertake his ceremonial</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_243"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 243</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and shall take his money, <I>but has</I> not performed the ceremonial, what is then the decision and what is then the decision <I>about</I> the man who ordered the ceremonial?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that the merit of a ceremonial not performed is not set going, and does not come to the soul of the undertaker who shall take money for it, <I>nor</I> even <I>to</I> that of the orderer who gave money for it. 3. But, <I>as to</I> him who is the orderer, since his mental meritoriousness is so steadfast that he gave his money, the efficacy (t&ucirc;ban) of the good work, mentally his own, <I>has</I> not stayed <I>away</I> from him, because he gave money authorisedly for the good work; the decision, then, <I>about</I> him is such as <I>about him</I> to whom harm occurs in performing a good work for the religion. 4. It is said that the angels so recompense him that he does not consider it as <I>any</I> other harm; and as much as the good money given&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_917"></A><A HREF="#fn_914"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> for the sacred feast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_918"></A><A HREF="#fn_915"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>and</I> ceremonial is then the pleasure <I>which</I> comes unto his soul, as much as would have been possible to arise in the world from that money.</p>  
<p>5. And he who shall take his money, and did not perform his ceremonial, is just as though he had abstracted from the angels&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_919"></A><A HREF="#fn_916"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the righteous guardian spirits, <I>and</I> destroyed, as much propitiation as would have been possible from that ceremonial; and he is, therefore, overwhelmed by it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_920"></A><A HREF="#fn_917"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and expiates <I>it</I> in the soul.</p>
