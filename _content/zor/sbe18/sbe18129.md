### CORRECTIONS.

P. [66](sbe18038.htm#page_66), line 15; [p. 67](sbe18038.htm#page_67),
l. 7; for 'Mitrô,' read 'Mit*r*ô.'

P. [198](sbe18071.htm#page_198), lines 1, 3, for 'the Supreme Being' and
'the Being' read 'God (yêdatô),' and cancel note 1.

P. [109](sbe18044.htm#page_109), note 2, add 'Malkôs has also been read
Markûs and traced to Av. mahrkû*s*ô (see Fragment VIII, 2 in
Westergaard's Zend-Avesta, p. 334), which appears to be the title of
some demon, regarding whom very little can be ascertained from the text
that mentions him.'

P. [143](sbe18050.htm#page_143), l. 12; [145](sbe18050.htm#page_145), l.
6; [150](sbe18051.htm#page_150), note 6; [252](sbe18095.htm#page_252),
l. 6; [289](sbe18104.htm#page_289), note 2;
[318](sbe18111.htm#page_318), ll. 26, 27; [346](sbe18117.htm#page_346),
l. 24; for 'Âtûr' and 'Âtûrŏ' read 'Âtû*r*' and 'Âtû*r*ŏ.'

The following emendations depend upon the meaning to be attached to the
word vâspôharak, or vâspûharak, which in Mkh. I, 7 was traced to Pers.
bâ, 'with,' and sipihrah, 'sphere, world, universe,' and supposed to
mean 'world-renowned,' being rendered by vikhyâtimat in Sanskrit. The
objections to this etymology are that Pers. bâ is Pahl. a*v*âk (not vâ),
which is nearly always replaced by Huz. levatman, and that vâspûhar
appears to be the correct form of the word vaspûr, which explains the
Huz. barbêtâ, literally 'son of the house' in the Pahlavi Farhang (p. 9,
ed. H.); the latter word having been the highest title of the Persian
nobility, probably confined to the heads of seven families (see
Nŏldeke's Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden, pp.
71, 501). Such nobles are called barbêtân in the Hâ*g*îâbâd inscription,
line 6, and vâspûharakan in the Naq*s*-i Rustam inscription, line 6;
they may perhaps be styled 'princes,' and their title, vâspûhar, may be
traced to the ancient Persian equivalent of Av. vîsô puthra (Vend. VII,
114), literally 'son of the village or borough.' It may be noted,
however, that the word 'sphere' does really occur in a form very similar
to this title, in the word aspiharakânîkîhâ, 'as regards the spheres,'
in Dd. 88, 4.

P. [78](sbe18043.htm#page_78), ll. 11-13, read 'But those who are the
more princely (vâspûharakânîktar) producers of the renovation are said
to be seven . . .'

P. [91](sbe18044.htm#page_91), ll. 11, 12, read '. . . and he made the
princes (vâspûharakânîhâ) contented.'

P. [172](sbe18055.htm#page_172), ll. 26, 27, read '. . . a minder of the
princes of the religion (dînvâspûharakânŏ), the angels, and *with* pure
thoughts . . .'

P. [262](sbe18098.htm#page_262), ll. 15, 16, read '. . . and its
position is most princely (vâspûharakânîktar).'

P. [282](sbe18103.htm#page_282), ll. 17, 18, read 'On account of the
princeliness (vâspûharakânîh) of the good *people* of Khvanîras . . .'

P. [289](sbe18104.htm#page_289), ll. 14, 15, read '. . . I *am* more
applauding the princes (vâspûharakânŏ-zâhtar) about the property of the
profession . . .'

P. [306](sbe18108.htm#page_306), ll. 23, 24, read '. . . to keep in use
the equal measure *which is* more *the custom* of his own superiors
(naf*s*man vâspûharakântar).'
