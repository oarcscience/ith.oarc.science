### CHAPTER IX.

1\. The eighth question is that which you ask thus: Of him who, out of
his *own* wealth, himself directed others thus: 'Let them act
advantageously (khan*g*înakŏ) for my soul,' is it so that what others
may do for him out of that wealth *and that* done by his own toil are
very different, one from the other, or not?

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

2\. The reply is this, that *they* are very different, one from the
other; for that which he orders out of his own wealth is more effectual
than that which others may do for him without order. 3. And among the
kinds of good work, that is more effectual which *one* practises himself
and with his own toil; then that *which one* sets going out of whatever
is his own by his own order, regarding which he <span
id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_79) afterwards bequeaths *and* orders out of
his own *property and* it comes into progress; and, lastly, that which
others may do for him.

4\. Since thus his own *and* that which is his by design, when any one
manages for him and in his life*time*, aggrandize his position then,
*and his* soul is preserved, when he manages for him thereafter the
enjoyment then reaches unto his soul. 5. When not consenting as to the
good work, and *it is* not his by design, even though others may do *it*
for him it does not then come into his possession.
