### OBSERVATIONS.

1\. For all divisions into chapters and sections the translator is
responsible, as the manuscripts are written continuously, with very few
stops marked, and even those are often misplaced.

2-6. (The same as on page [2](sbe18008.htm#page_2).)

7\. The manuscripts mentioned are:--

BK, an old imperfect copy of K35 written in Kirmân, but now in Bombay.

J (about 60 years old), belonging to Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji in
Bombay.

K35 (probably written A.D. 1572), No. 35 in the University Library at
Kopenhagen; upon the text of which this translation is based.

M10 (about 150 years old), a Persian Rivâyat, No. 10 of the Haug
Collection in the State Library at Munich.

# EPISTLES OF MÂNÛ*SK*ÎHAR.

## EPISTLE I.

#### TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF SÎRKÂN.

THROUGH the name and assistance of the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the
whole of the sacred beings, all the angels of the spiritual *and* the
angels of the worldly *existences*.

A copy of the epistle of the priest Mânû*sk*îhar <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[1](#fn_1068), son of Yûdân-Yim, which *was*
composed by him for the good *people* of Sîrkân <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[2](#fn_1069), on the contents of the precepts
(vi*g*îr-ka*rd*ŏ)) which the priest Zâ*d*-sparam <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[3](#fn_1070), son of Yûdân-Yim, prepared.

### CHAPTER I.

1\. *In* the name of the sacred beings, who sent you a soul with long
life, with provision for proper progress, *and* with the protection of
increase of righteousness and wisdom, may such works and

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

mysterious dignity, encompassed with <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1](#fn_1071) happiness, now possess increasing
prosperity and a complete share of pre-eminent welfare and great
exaltation in both worlds.

2\. The epistle <span id="fr_1076"></span>[2](#fn_1072) which *was*
wisely, properly, and with religious demeanour ordered by you, *and*
sent by a courier (paîkŏ), *has* come, and *has* enveloped *and*
assailed (*g*astŏ) me, indeed, with appalling intelligence on other
subjects; and if even a portion <span id="fr_1077"></span>[3](#fn_1073)
*of* the vast importance and great value, as regards your heavenly
*concerns*, arrangements, and natural *and* unpremeditated (avarîk)
prodigies <span id="fr_1078"></span>[4](#fn_1074), which are for my
knowledge, for the sake of courteous (drû*d*îk) information, *be* owing
to intelligence for which the courteousness *and* proper courageousness
are among you, special pleasure is received *therewith*. 3. And praise
is, thereupon, recited by me to the sacred beings, as regards the
conflicting affairs even of this disordered (gûmê*z*i*s*nîkŏ) existence;
worldly possessions, as much as are suitable for the assistance of
wisdom, are proper <span id="fr_1079"></span>[5](#fn_1075), and the gift
of virtuous pleasure is the gain of the undeserving good work *or*
prayer they (the sacred beings) shall accept; it causes aggrandizement
and is as deserving as even that which the decision of

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

the wise has said about *it*, that even from the management of
disordered possessions which are impaired *there* is advantage through
the power of wisdom; *and* they (the sacred beings) select and cleanse
and uplift the good works *in* such manner as a precious stone (sag
khêl) from the water, and gold brocade <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[1](#fn_1076) from the dust.

4\. My pleasure, also, is as much increased through the information clue
to the same courtesy, *and I have* a new *and* great desire for the
arrival of information, continuously from henceforth, about the perfect
courageousness, enduring humility, good works; worshipping, favouring
position, and eagerness of soul of you who *have* recounted *your* great
thoughtfulness for religion *and have* provided good works.

5\. On account of the universal renown (aspôharakânîh) of the good
*people* of Khvanîras <span id="fr_1081"></span>[2](#fn_1077), which is
yours, owing to the favour that is your complete happiness, ardently
*and* joyfully most desired, and constantly *so*, when *there* are
opportunities of seeing you--though it is supposed *to be* the advantage
of your own religion, joy of soul, courteousness, *and* proper
constancy--since my will *resides* among you, you make known *and*
command my actions, through the will of the sacred beings.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[279:1](sbe18102.htm#fr_1072) The high-priest
of Pârs and Kirmân (see the heading to Dd., p. 3).

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[279:2](sbe18102.htm#fr_1073) Written Sîrkân
once, Sîrkânŏ twice, and Sîrgâno four times, in these epistles. It was a
town of considerable importance in former times (see Ouseley's Oriental
Geography, pp. 138-145), about thirty parasangs south of Kirmân.

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[279:3](sbe18102.htm#fr_1074) He was
high-priest of Sîrkân and brother of Mânû*sk*îhar (as expressly stated
in the heading to Ep. II), both being sons of the same father.

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[280:1](sbe18102.htm#fr_1075) Or, 'sent down
in,' according as we read parvastŏ or frôstŏ.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[280:2](sbe18102.htm#fr_1076) An epistle
complaining of certain heretical teachings of their high-priest,
Zâ*d*-sparam, which is no longer extant.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[280:3](sbe18102.htm#fr_1077) Reading va hat
vâhar-i*k*.

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[280:4](sbe18102.htm#fr_1078) The epistle
which he had received from his brother, Zâ*d*-sparam, some time before,
seems also to have mentioned certain omens (see Ep. II, i, 3).

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[280:5](sbe18102.htm#fr_1079) J omits
shâye*d*ŏ, 'are proper,' because it follows the other shâye*d*, 'are
suitable;' but it is not always safe to assume that the repetition of a
word is a blunder.

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[281:1](sbe18102.htm#fr_1080) Reading dîpakŏ-î
zahabâ.

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[281:2](sbe18102.htm#fr_1081) The central
region of the earth, containing all the lands best known to the Iranians
(see Dd. XC, 3).
