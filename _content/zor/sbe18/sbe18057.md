### CHAPTER L.

1\. The forty-ninth question is that you ask thus: *If* they should sell
wine unto foreigners and infidels what is then the decision *about* it?

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

2\. The reply is this, that *there* is very vehement danger of grievous
sin, and it would be an evil occupation. 3. But if through the operation
of that wine-selling of theirs the wine is kept more away from those who
become worse through immoderate drinking of wine, *and* comes to those
who drink wine in moderation <span
id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_663)--*whom* they cause to become better
through drinking the wine--more than when they shall not practise that
selling of the wine, then through that selling of theirs the power which
is in the wealth <span id="fr_667"></span>[2](#fn_664), by their keeping
away of which a man is confirmed (pa*d*ayînî*d*ŏ) in the good religion
and diverted from going into infidelity, the progress of sin is impeded
*and* good works are promoted, becomes the assistance of the good and
protection of religion, the hindrance of sin and aid of good works,
which, when they shall not practise that wine-selling, do not arise,
*and* which are much more promoted than the various sins that might have
arisen from the unlawfully drinking of wine. 4. Or, otherwise, the
greater decision--and great are the good works which are assured
therein--is thus: 'They who shall sell wine <span
id="fr_668"></span>[3](#fn_665) to foreigners, infidels, and others from
whom unlawful conduct arises through drunkenness, *act* very sinfully
and not authorisedly.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_663"></span>[177:1](sbe18057.htm#fr_666) That is, when the
supply of wine is so limited that by selling it to moderate drinkers
they keep it away from drunkards.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[177:2](sbe18057.htm#fr_667) The wealth they
acquire by selling wide, which would have produced evil in the hands of
the buyers, and ought to produce good in their own.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[177:3](sbe18057.htm#fr_668) K35 has vinâs,
'sin,' instead of âs, 'wine,' which is clearly wrong.
