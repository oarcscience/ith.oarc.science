<p>1. <I>As to</I> the eighty-seventh question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: <I>As</I> family householders we of the good religion of Ir&acirc;n, before each <I>celebration of</I> all the religious rites with holy-water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_941"></A><A HREF="#fn_938"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> which they have provided in the land&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_942"></A><A HREF="#fn_939"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of P&acirc;rs, have then always given for it a gift of 400 dirhams, <I>or</I> 350 dirhams&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_943"></A><A HREF="#fn_940"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> <I>at</I> least. 2. And now if <I>we</I> should be needy, when we deduct something from the 400 dirhams, or from the 350 dirhams, of the gift for them, they would then not accept <I>it</I> from us, and speak thus: 'Less than 400, or than 350, dirhams we do not&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_944"></A><A HREF="#fn_941"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> accept.' 3. <I>But</I> there are needy <I>men</I>&nbsp;</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_251"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 251</FONT></A></p>  
<p>who always come to us themselves and speak thus: 'For 350 dirhams we will always twice conduct all the religious rites <I>and</I> ceremonial with holy-water such as <I>those</I> which you have always ordered before for 400; only order us.' 4. Would a needy <I>one, apart</I> from the priestly men <I>who</I> always say that they are not, be authorised, or not?</p>  
<p>5. The reply is this, that the priest <I>to whom your</I> predecessors <I>have</I> given a gift of 400 or 350 <I>dirhams</I>, for all the religious rites with holy-water, it is proper to consider particularly virtuous <I>and</I> faithful, when there is nothing else <I>about</I> him, on account of which he is otherwise: 6. A <I>celebration of</I> all the religious rites with holy-water, in which they shall use four pure animals&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_945"></A><A HREF="#fn_942"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--<I>and</I> just according to the teaching of the high-priests they present <I>to</I> every single fire from one animal <I>and</I> one holy-water--and the offering of holy-water unto the fire whose holy-water <I>it is</I>, and bringing it on to another fire <I>apart</I> from that holy-water, and the <I>ceremonial</I> cleansing of the holy-water they maintain by agreement in thy name, the superiors solemnize with approval, faithfully, and attentively; <I>and</I> the remuneration of 350 dirhams would be a balancing of when they conduct the religious rite <I>at</I> the place of undertaking <I>it, and</I> when <I>it</I> is undertaken as regards a distant district&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_946"></A><A HREF="#fn_943"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>7. In A<I>r</I>takhshatar-gadman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_947"></A><A HREF="#fn_944"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, within my memory,</p>

<p><A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they who would accept less than 300 dirhams&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_948"></A><A HREF="#fn_945"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> for it made a memorandum (farh&acirc;ng), to keep in remembrance <I>that</I> 350 dirhams for all the religious rites performed <I>was</I> to be the rule declared by those of the religion <I>in</I> A<I>r</I>takhshatar-gadman. 8. Likewise, the glorified At&ucirc;<I>r</I>-fr&ocirc;bag&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_949"></A><A HREF="#fn_946"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>son</I> of Far&acirc;kh&ucirc;z&acirc;<I>d</I>, who was the pre-eminent leader of those of the good religion, decided <I>in</I> the same manner.</p>  
<p>9. And now, too, they always conduct those <I>rites</I> which are without holy-water for 150 dirhams, <I>or</I> even for 120 dirhams&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_950"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; and the reason of it is the neediness of the disciples who, owing to that need, <I>and</I> in hope of obtaining more employment, always diminish <I>their demands, and</I> through deficient remuneration always become more needy, more importunate, and more moderate in desiring remuneration; and, in the course <I>of</I> the employment of resources and requesting <I>the charge of</I> all the religious rites, the labour and endurance of discipleship are exhausted.</p>  
<p>10. And <I>as to</I> him who undertakes to conduct all the religious rites twice for 350 dirhams, if <I>he be</I> properly working <I>and</I> thoroughly reliable <I>for</I> the 350 dirhams <I>which</I> are always given him for the ceremonial of all the religious rites--just like those who would always undertake <I>them</I> once--and all the religious rites are conducted <I>and</I> secured twice, on</p>

<p>account of the merit due to the continuous ceremonial of the sacred beings it is more authorisedly ordered of those who solemnize all the religious rites twice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_951"></A><A HREF="#fn_948"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 11. But <I>as</I> to <I>him</I> who would under-take all the religious rites twice for 350 dirhams, <I>but</I> is not able to conduct <I>them</I> unless he puts to it <I>some</I> of his own wealth, so that the progress <I>may be</I> acceptable to him as they conduct <I>them</I> through repetition, he should not undertake <I>them</I> owing to the reasons written in another chapter of ours&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_952"></A><A HREF="#fn_949"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, since <I>it tends</I> much more to neediness.</p>  
<p>12. And more like unto the ancient sceptics (vim&acirc;nak&#335;) <I>have</I> become the disciples, among whom disagreement <I>and</I> enmity are produced, as is written in the same writing (khad&ucirc;-g&ucirc;n n&acirc;mak&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_953"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; <I>and</I>, owing to admonishing words, these <I>become</I> enviousness and maliciousness unto the disciples, <I>and</I> trouble <I>and</I> disagreement less becoming among you and more contentious about you. 13. And at the time <I>in</I> which a great stipend existed, <I>they</I> contended with him through whose greatness <I>and</I> abundance of stipend their conflict was caused, one with the other, through envy; and now, too, they <A HREF="errata.htm#0">always</A> squabble <I>about</I> his deficient stipend, by which they will tempt them, on account of <I>its</I> inadequacy, for the sake of a way for preserving life, as was shown by my metaphor in the other chapter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_954"></A><A HREF="#fn_951"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 14. When those who, through need of <I>employment in the rites</I> of religion, or the recitations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_955"></A><A HREF="#fn_952"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<p>which are its wisdom, would at once produce enmity, and the friends of religion, are for each <I>of</I> two sides, <I>it</I> is important to look to the procuring of forgiveness, kind regards, and the progress of the elect (pasandak&acirc;n&#335;) in the duty of the faithful.</p>
