### CHAPTER III.

1\. This, too, I am begging of you, that *you* may be desiring the
truth, and *that* Vohûman <span id="fr_1094"></span>[2](#fn_1090), who,

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

when a ruler (shah) of yours, is an interpreter (pâ*k*ûkŏ) about the
writing which <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1](#fn_1091) I write, *may* as
regardfully *and* accommodatingly observe *and* direct as the variety of
dispositions *permits*. 2. For you are of like opinion with me, to
inform again the most initiated <span id="fr_1096"></span>[2](#fn_1092);
so that I am more steadfastly-determined (aûstîkânŏ-mini*s*ntar)
thereon. 3. And if there be *anything* that seems to you otherwise,
direct *some one* to point *it* out again, with the reason *for*
maintaining *it* which occurs to you, just as a household companion is a
responder *and* has spoken again for the sake of pointing out again; for
there are many reasons, on account of which your kindly-regardful
observation is needful, which are to be written about.

4\. The first is this, that the penmanship of the spirits is not the
profession of me and others <span id="fr_1097"></span>[3](#fn_1093);
*and as to* him by whom a theory (farhâng) not universally operating is
disseminated, which is *distinct* from his more indispensable
occupation, *there* is then no command for his teaching *and*
apostleship therein. 5. On that account, too, the wise *and* the seekers
for truth uphold the' body of opinion about the statements of the
writing of the spirits <span id="fr_1098"></span>[4](#fn_1094), and,
therefore, direct less of the ingenuity of preparing again the
penmanship of various tidings.

6\. The second is this, that, in the distress (dahyakŏ) of this grievous
time, he to whom

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

adherence *and* much indebtedness even as to his *fore*fathers *have*
remained, is well-lamenting, owing to the proposals (dâ*d*anŏ) of the
unfriendly, and much harm has occurred through the conflicting
(âr*d*îkŏ) offer of remedies *and* lawful provision of means, full of
trouble, except, indeed, to the upholder of religion who is more
worldly-managing and investigation by opponents is grievous danger full
of things inopportune *and* unnecessary for accomplishment <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[1](#fn_1095).

7\. The third is this, that a wise *man* who is a high-priest of the
spirit-retaining <span id="fr_1100"></span>[2](#fn_1096) religion *and*
acquainted with opinions, when also himself properly humble, fearless,
and benedictive in the world, is then even, owing to his
estimating <span id="fr_1101"></span>[3](#fn_1097) pardonings *and*
long-*continued* dexterity (dêr zîva*k*akîh), united with the good
creations in affliction *and* vexation. 8. And, on account of
information about the worldly *and* spiritual misery of former evils of
many kinds--always as much in the religion, *and* in the thoughts of
others <span id="fr_1102"></span>[4](#fn_1098), as *one* delivers up his
heart to ingenious verbiage and for the preparation of phrases--he
speaks as in the question in revelation, thus <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[5](#fn_1099): '"Who in the bodily existence

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

is more quickly fortunate?" *and* it is answered thus: "The youth who is
observant *and* humble, O Zaratû*s*t! who, as regards both that which
has happened and that *which* happens, also sees that which is evil and
good with gratitude, just like that also which *happens* unto another;"'
because he knows this, that from this is a benefit, for he knows
happiness and also misery <span id="fr_1104"></span>[1](#fn_1100). 9.
The glorified leader of those of the good religion, Hêr-Frôvag <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[2](#fn_1101), son of Farukhûzâ*d*, wrote: 'It is he
understands the consequence of his own action; and *it* is his great
household attendant, and the worldly desire provided at the *K*inva*d*
bridge <span id="fr_1106"></span>[3](#fn_1102) becomes less watchful.'

10\. The fourth is this, that I *am* more universally hoping about the
property of the profession *and* the much duty fit for the truly wise,
*in* such manner as even that *in* which the glorified and
greatly-learned leader of those of the good religion, Yûdân-Yim <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[4](#fn_1103), son of Shahpûhar, always urged on a
priestly man with many sons *and* equally clever <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[5](#fn_1104) discourse.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

11\. That *was* through my instigation, alone and with little
assistance, in the beginning; and, on account of the deficiency of
warriors <span id="fr_1109"></span>[1](#fn_1105), the abundance of
opponents, the very rapid arrival of disturbance, *and* the fourfold
supplication for keeping away the ruin *or* hasty unlawful maintenance
*of* the fires *of* the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, my constant distress is
such that most of my time speaks of the same subject <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[2](#fn_1106). 12. They may leave the abundance of
despondency and thoughtfulness of the bodily existence to such remedial
writing of his, unto whom the pleasantly comfortable thought of an
evaded (vîrikhtô) seizure is requisite, but *there* is little worldly
leisure for me for writing more *in* this direction (hanâ-runtar). 13.
And specially in this passing *time*--when, alike limited by the coming
of the period of giving daily *supplies* to the performers of worship,
*and by* the ever-triumphant fire and *its* produce <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[3](#fn_1107), it was necessary for me to go to
Shirâ*z* <span id="fr_1112"></span>[4](#fn_1108) on account of some
indispensable provision of means--the work was much *and* the leisure
little.

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

14\. The fifth is this, that the custom of providing for all the duties
even of the *sacred* fire (âtû*r*) by me, and my own desire <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1](#fn_1109), trained hand <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[2](#fn_1110), unhardened mind, and unhardened heart
*for* managing many *things* should have become the joy of *my* mind.
15. Then, too, from *having* read such writing *and* such news the
healer of distress would be thoroughly connected with my heart and mind,
*owing* to which my intellect would have become quickly fatigued
(mândakŏ) by a limited preparation of phrases.

16\. The sixth is this, that even he who is a rescued <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[3](#fn_1111) *and* better-operating (hû-dâgtar)
man--when, owing to the writing of a learned *man* of the realm who is
desiring the truth, *he* is so perplexed <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[4](#fn_1112) on account of a doubt of increasing
the after-tearing of the same perplexity--*has* no doubt of the falsity
and little training existent in the worldly.

17\. The seventh is this, that if none of these six *of* which I *have*
written should exist, even then your approved cleverness (*s*îvagdârîh),
extolled freedom from strife, hereafter-discerning and complete
mindfulness,

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

practised <span id="fr_1117"></span>[1](sbe18105.htm#fn_1113) attention
to the good, and much affection <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[2](sbe18105.htm#fn_1114) for the faithful--so
kindly regarding, truly judging, *and* with a liking for praising
(srî*d*anŏ), as regards whatever I write truly *and* with true
conviction--are, I consider, to make provision, and *have* realised a
preparation striven for.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1090"></span>[286:2](sbe18104.htm#fr_1094) The archangel
personifying 'good thought' (see Dd. III, 13).

<span id="fn_1091"></span>[287:1](sbe18104.htm#fr_1095) Reading î
instead of va, 'and.'

<span id="fn_1092"></span>[287:2](sbe18104.htm#fr_1096) That is, to
severely admonish their high-priest, as he does in Ep. II.

<span id="fn_1093"></span>[287:3](sbe18104.htm#fr_1097) That is, he
disclaims all pretensions to inspiration on the part of himself and his
contemporaries.

<span id="fn_1094"></span>[287:4](sbe18104.htm#fr_1098) The inspired
scriptures.

<span id="fn_1095"></span>[288:1](sbe18104.htm#fr_1099) Referring to the
risk of unfriendly and destructive criticism of the scriptures.

<span id="fn_1096"></span>[288:2](sbe18104.htm#fr_1100) J has
'spirit-observing,' by changing gîri*s*nŏ into nigîri*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_1097"></span>[288:3](sbe18104.htm#fr_1101) Reading andasîh;
the reference being to the sympathy acquired by a high-priest through
performing his duty of appointing atonements for sins confessed to him.

<span id="fn_1098"></span>[288:4](sbe18104.htm#fr_1102) Assuming that
aî*s*anŏ stands for aî*s*ânŏ.

<span id="fn_1099"></span>[288:5](sbe18104.htm#fr_1103) J. has only 'as
*one* speaks out his heart for ingenious verbiage and phrases, thus.'
The question and reply here quoted seen to be no longer extant in the
Avesta.

<span id="fn_1100"></span>[289:1](sbe18104.htm#fr_1104) It is doubtful
whether this last clause be a portion of the quotation, or not.

<span id="fn_1101"></span>[289:2](sbe18104.htm#fr_1105) This name is
corrupted into Hê-Fôrvag in the MSS., but Âtûr-Frôbag is probably
intended. He was the compiler of a great part of the Dînka*rd*, and is
also mentioned in Dd. LXXXVIII, 8. The names Atûr and Hêr are
synonymous, both meaning 'fire.' The passage quoted in the text has the
same form (beginning with the word hôman*d*ŏ, 'it is') as nearly all the
sections of the third book of the Dînka*rd*, but it has not yet been
discovered among them.

<span id="fn_1102"></span>[289:3](sbe18104.htm#fr_1106) Here written
*K*i*s*-vi*d*arg (see Dd. XX, 3).

<span id="fn_1103"></span>[289:4](sbe18104.htm#fr_1107) So written in J,
but K35 and BK have the syllable din somewhat corrupted. The person
meant, both here and in Chap. VII, 5, was probably the author's father,
though Bd. XXXIII, 11 seems to make Yûdân-Yim the son of Vâhrâm-shâ*d*.

<span id="fn_1104"></span>[289:5](sbe18104.htm#fr_1108) Reading
ham-gôkŏ, but J has ham-dû*d*akŏ, 'of the same family;' it also omits
several other words by mistake.

<span id="fn_1105"></span>[290:1](sbe18104.htm#fr_1109) From this and
Ep. II, v, 14 it would appear that the priests at that time maintained a
body of troops for the protection of their followers.

<span id="fn_1106"></span>[290:2](sbe18104.htm#fr_1110) That is,
regarding the proper maintenance of the priesthood, which had already
engaged his anxious attention during the life-time of his father.

<span id="fn_1107"></span>[290:3](sbe18104.htm#fr_1111) The word var may
either mean 'ashes' (see Sls. II, 49), alluding to clearing out, the
fire, or it may mean 'ordeal' (see Sls. XIII, 17).

<span id="fn_1108"></span>[290:4](sbe18104.htm#fr_1112) See Dd. I, 17.
This name is written Shirâ*z*ŏ once, Sîrâ*z*ŏ thrice, and Sirâ*z*ŏ four
times in K35. Mânû*sk*îhar appears to have come to Shirâ*z* on this
occasion to hold a general assembly of the priests and leading members
of the community, and he wrote this epistle from that city (see Ep: II,
i, 11;. v, 10).

<span id="fn_1109"></span>[291:1](sbe18104.htm#fr_1113) Reading kâmakŏ,
instead of the unintelligible kâmûn.

<span id="fn_1110"></span>[291:2](sbe18104.htm#fr_1114) The MSS. omit
the last letter of yadman.

<span id="fn_1111"></span>[291:3](sbe18104.htm#fr_1115) That is,
delivered from contamination or sin; virikhtô is probably to be traced
to Av. vi+irikhta, rather than to vi+rikhta (Pers. gurêkht).

<span id="fn_1112"></span>[291:4](sbe18104.htm#fr_1116) K35 has a blank
space here, and again a few words further on, but it is doubtful if any
words be missing, The spaces are filled up in J and BK, apparently by
guess, as follows: J has 'he sees so perplexing a chance, concerning
which, owing to the increase of after-tearing of the same perplexity and
the arrival of evil, *he* is doubtful, *has* no doubt,' &e. And BK has
'*he* is so perplexed on account of no doubt of the falsity *and* little
training *that* existed in the worldly for increasing the after-tearing
of the same perplexity, *has* no doubt, &c.'
