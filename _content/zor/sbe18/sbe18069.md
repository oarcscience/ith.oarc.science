### CHAPTER LXII.

1\. *As to* the sixty-first question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: How stand the shares in the inheritance (mîrâtŏ) of property among
those of the good religion, and how is it necessary for them to stand
therein?

2\. The reply is this, that in the possession of wealth the wealth
reaches higher *or* lower, just like water when it goes in a stream on a
declivity, but when the passage shall be closed at the bottom it goes
back on the running water (pûy-â*v*ŏ), *and* then it does not go to its
after-*course* <span id="fr_712"></span>[2](#fn_709).

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

3\. When there is nothing *otherwise* in the will and private <span
id="fr_713"></span>[1](#fn_710), property *goes* to a wife *or*
daughter <span id="fr_714"></span>[2](#fn_711) who is privileged; if
*one* gives her anything by will then she does not obtain the share
(dâ*s*) *pertaining* to her <span id="fr_715"></span>[3](#fn_712). 4.
Whenever <span id="fr_716"></span>[4](#fn_713) a share for a son is not
provided by it, every one *has* so much and the wife who may be a
privileged *one has* twice as much; and the share of that *one* of the
sons <span id="fr_717"></span>[5](#fn_714), *or* even the wife of a son,
who is blind in both eyes, or crippled <span
id="fr_718"></span>[6](#fn_715) in both feet, or maimed in both his
hands, is twice as much as that *of one* who is sound.

5\. And *it* is needful *that* he who was in the father's guardianship
*shall* remain in guardianship, as when a father or mother is decrepit
and causing awe (*k*agarîn), or *of* a nurture different from that of
the guardian <span id="fr_719"></span>[7](#fn_716)--or a child of his
brother or sister, or a father, or *one* <span
id="fr_720"></span>[8](#fn_717) without nurture apart from him, is

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

without a guardian--the ready guardianship of a capable man, and the
shelter *and* nourishment *that* have become inadequate <span
id="fr_721"></span>[1](#fn_718) are as indispensably forth*coming* <span
id="fr_722"></span>[2](#fn_719) from the possessors of wealth, of those
who *have* taken the property, as that *taking* was indispensable <span
id="fr_723"></span>[3](#fn_720).

6\. If *there* be no son of that *man*, but there be a daughter or wife
of his, and if *some* of the *affairs* <span
id="fr_724"></span>[4](#fn_721) of the man are such as render a woman
not suitable for the guardianship, it is necessary to appoint a family
guardian; if there be, moreover, no wife *or* daughter of his it is
necessary to appoint an adopted son. 7. This--that is, when it is
necessary to appoint a family guardian *and* who is the fittest, *and*
when it is necessary to appoint an adopted son *and* which is the
fittest--is written in the chapters *on* the question <span
id="fr_725"></span>[5](#fn_722).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_709"></span>[194:2](sbe18069.htm#fr_712) This metaphor
seems to mean that property, like water, always <span id="page_195">p.
195</span> descends until it meets with an obstruction to its downward
progress in the shape of the nearest descendants, but, when once in
their possession, it can again ascend (like the dammed stream) for the
support of the survivors of an older generation (see § 5).

<span id="fn_710"></span>[195:1](sbe18069.htm#fr_713) Or, it may be 'in
the provisions (vûyagân) of the will;' or, by omitting two strokes, we
have simply 'otherwise (hân) in the will.'

<span id="fn_711"></span>[195:2](sbe18069.htm#fr_714) That is, they have
a share of the property when there are other next of kin. M14 adds, 'and
they should provide a living son as father and husband unless
privileged,' referring to the necessity of adoption when there is no son
and the wife is not a privileged one.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[195:3](sbe18069.htm#fr_715) It being assumed
that the will provides as much as is intended for any one whom it
mentions.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[195:4](sbe18069.htm#fr_716) Reading amat,
'when,' instead of mûn, 'who; which words are often confounded because
their Pâz. equivalents are nearly identical.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[195:5](sbe18069.htm#fr_717) M14 has
'daughters.'

<span id="fn_715"></span>[195:6](sbe18069.htm#fr_718) Armê*s*t probably
means literally 'most immovable.'

<span id="fn_716"></span>[195:7](sbe18069.htm#fr_719) M14 omits this
last clause.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[195:8](sbe18069.htm#fr_720) M14 has 'mother.'

<span id="fn_718"></span>[196:1](sbe18069.htm#fr_721) Literally 'not
issuing.'

<span id="fn_719"></span>[196:2](sbe18069.htm#fr_722) M14 has 'are thus
forth*coming*'

<span id="fn_720"></span>[196:3](sbe18069.htm#fr_723) M14 has 'or *have*
become indispensable to it.'

<span id="fn_721"></span>[196:4](sbe18069.htm#fr_724) Or, it may be
'*dependents*;' the text is merely va hatŏ min zak-î gab*r*â.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[196:5](sbe18069.htm#fr_725) See Chaps.
