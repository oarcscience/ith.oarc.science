### CHAPTER LVII.

1\. *As to* the fifty-sixth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: Who is suitable *for* adoption, *and* who is not suitable?

2\. The reply is this, that a grown-up man of the good religion who is
intelligent, a complete ruler of a numerous household <span
id="fr_704"></span>[4](#fn_701), expecting offspring, *and* not *having
sins* worthy of death is suitable for adoption; even when he has
accepted either one adoption, or many adoptions, he is then still
suitable for another adoption. 3. And a grown-up woman, *or* even a
child, is suitable for one adoption, *but* when adopted in one family
she is not suitable for another adoption.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

4\. A woman requiring a husband--though a complete worshipper--or a
foreigner, or an infidel, or *one* having *sins* worthy of death, is
unfit for adoption; so also those who are demon-worshippers, she who is
a concubine (shûsar nê*s*man) *or* courtezan, *and* she who is
menstruous are unfit.
