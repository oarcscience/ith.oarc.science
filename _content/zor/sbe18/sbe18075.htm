<p>1. <I>As to</I> the sixty-seventh question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: What is this which, when the sun and moon <I>have</I> both come up, is something&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_781"></A><A HREF="#fn_778"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p>come, <I>and</I> comes on as <I>it were</I> anew when it (the moon) becomes new, <I>and</I> men want the thing to go down from the place <I>where it</I> is becoming apparent? 2. When it <I>has</I> been several times, what is then the thing <I>which</I> comes up <I>and</I> exists, and how is its motion by night and day?</p>  
<p>3. The reply is this, that the sun and moon are always seen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_779"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> there where they stand, and they exist for men and the creatures. 4. The sun is swifter-moving&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_783"></A><A HREF="#fn_780"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> than the moon, <I>and</I> every day becomes a little in advance; at the new moon the sun is shining, and the moon owing to diminution backwards, on account of the slenderness of the moon by much travelling&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_781"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and on account of the brilliance of the sun, is not apparent. 5. As the sun goes down a light which is not very apparent is the moon, and not <I>having</I> gone down the moon is seen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_782"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; and each day the moon increases, comes up more behind the sun, <I>and</I> goes down more behind, <I>and</I> is, therefore, more seen. 6. When increased to the utmost, which is approaching a likeness of the sun, it comes spherical (aspiharak&#335;), and is seen the whole night; to diminish anew it comes back to the companionship of the sun, and goes into the splendour of the sun.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_778"></A><A HREF="sbe18075.htm#fr_781">210:4</A> The only probable reading for this word is mindavam, 'a thing;' it occurs three times in this question, but is a very vague term for the phases of the moon, probably referring to a supposed body covering the dark part of the moon's disc.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_779"></A><A HREF="sbe18075.htm#fr_782">211:1</A> The MSS. have ast&icirc;-h&ecirc;nd, 'have remained,' instead of khad&icirc;tun&icirc;-h&ecirc;nd, 'are seen;' but the difference between these words in Pahlavi letters is merely a medial stroke.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_780"></A><A HREF="sbe18075.htm#fr_783">211:2</A> Apparently so, as the moon rises and sets about 48 minutes later every day, on the average.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_781"></A><A HREF="sbe18075.htm#fr_784">211:3</A> A very anthropomorphic mode of accounting for the waning of the moon into a slender crescent.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_782"></A><A HREF="sbe18075.htm#fr_785">211:4</A> Most Orientals consider the day of the new moon to be that in the evening of which it is first possible to see the moon; this is usually the first, but sometimes the second, day after the actual change of the moon according to European ideas.</P>
