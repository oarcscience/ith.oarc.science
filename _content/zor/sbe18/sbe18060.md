### CHAPTER LIII.

1\. *As to* the fifty-second question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: *If* people of the good religion, in *their* country *or* out of
*their* country, shall buy *and* sell with those of a different religion
as regards cattle, *or* shall lay hold of traders (vanîkgarân) and shall
sell to them, what is then the decision about it? 2. When *those of* the
good religion shall not buy, as they have not come *up to* the price,
but *the orthodox dealers* shall sell to traders *and* those of a
different religion, what is then the decision about it? 3. *And* about
him, of whom the means of existence (zîvi*s*nŏ mindavam) are such, what
is then the decision?

4\. The reply is this, that it would be very grievously sinful, and it
would be an evil occupation to transact such business through the
influence of opportunity, *and* to seek profit unauthorisedly in that
manner. 5. But if *it be* the means of existence *of* those of the good
religion *of* whom *you have* written, and *they* are not able to seek
*it* in any other business *and* proper occupation which *would be* a
less sinful meant of existence, complete <span

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

the good religion shall sell unto those of the good religion <span
id="fr_681"></span>[1](#fn_678); because it is possible for him *to be*
less sinful *to* whom *it* is allowable to beg the life of a comrade,
for still the rule *of* a righteous man, with the righteous who are in
his guardianship, is to live. 6. So it is possible, when they shall sell
cattle for slaughter *and* foreign eating, many cattle--amounting even
to a diminution of the maintenance of Irân--are more wretched than a
righteous man forced to kill *them* through a living becoming
unobtainable *and* the fear of death.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[182:1](sbe18059.htm#fr_679) That is, having
made a bargain, he is not to be aggrieved at any unexpected excess of
profit made in good faith by the other parties to the bargain; a rather
high standard of commercial morality.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[182:2](sbe18060.htm#fr_680) The word is pûr,
but it may be suspected of being a blunder, as tô*r*â, 'ox,' would be a
more likely word.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[183:1](sbe18060.htm#fr_681) Who would not be
likely to kill the animal, and with whom they could come to an
understanding as to its good treatment, so as to avoid the sin of
bô*d*yôzê*d*îh (see Chap. XLIX, 5 n).
