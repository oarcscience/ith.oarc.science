<p>THE controversy between M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har and his brother, Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam, of. which the Epistles of M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har are the only portion extant, turned chiefly upon the meaning to be attached to Vend. VIII, 271-299&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1689"></A><A HREF="#fn_1683"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and whether the mode of purification therein detailed was a sufficient substitute, or merely a preparation, for the Bareshn&ucirc;m ceremony. The following is a translation of the Pahlavi version of this passage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1690"></A><A HREF="#fn_1684"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:--</p>  
<p>Pahl. Vend. VIII, 271. 'O creator! how are those men purified, O righteous A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>! who shall stand by a corpse, in a distant place, upon a wild spot&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1691"></A><A HREF="#fn_1685"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>?'</p>  
<p>272. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'They are purified, O righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t!'</p>  
<p>273. 'But when so? [that is, how will <I>such a one</I> become clean?]'</p>  
<p>274. 'If a corpse-eating dog, or a corpse-eating bird, <I>has</I> attacked that corpse, (275) <I>the man</I> shall then purify over his own body with bull's urine, (276) thirty times by washing forwards [<I>with</I> the bull's urine], <I>and</I> thirty times by washing over&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1692"></A><A HREF="#fn_1686"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, [and</p>

<p>278. 'If a corpse-eating dog, or a corpse-eating bird, <I>has</I> not attacked that corpse, (279) <I>he shall purify</I> fifteen times by washing forwards, <I>and</I> fifteen times by washing backwards, [and <I>his</I> hand shall rub over it:]</p>  
<p>280. 'He shall run the first mile (h&acirc;sar)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1694"></A><A HREF="#fn_1688"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 281: He shall then run forwards, [when the Pa<I>n</I><I>k</I>adasa ("fifteen <I>times</I>") shall be performed by him.] 282. <I>And</I> when he shall thus stop opposite any one whomsoever of the material existence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1695"></A><A HREF="#fn_1689"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, he shall be prepared with a loud issue of words, (283) thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1696"></A><A HREF="#fn_1690"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>: "I have thus stood close by the body of him who is dead; I am no wisher <I>for it</I> by thought, I am no wisher <I>for it</I> by word, I am no wisher <I>for it</I> by deed, [that is, <I>it</I> is not possible for me <I>to be</I> as <I>though</I> washed.] 284. It demands purification for me, [that is, wash me thoroughly!]" 285. When he runs, the first he shall reach, (286) if they do not grant him purification, share one-third of that deed of his, [that is, of all that sin, not possible for him <I>to bear</I>, except when they shall perform <I>his purification</I>, one <I>part</I> in three is theirs at <I>its</I> origin.]</p>
