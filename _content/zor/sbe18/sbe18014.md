### CHAPTER VI.

1\. The fifth question is that you ask thus: Why does evil always happen
more *to* the good than to the bad?

2\. The reply is this, that not *at* every time and every place, *and*
not *to* all the good, does evil happen more--for the spiritual welfare
of the good is certainly more--but in the world it is very much more
manifest <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_69). 3. And the reasons for it
are many; one which is conclusive is even this, that the modes

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

and causes of *its* occurrence are more; for the occurrence of evil is
more particularly appointed (vakhtŏ) by two modes, one by the demons,
the appointers of evil, *and* one by the vile, the doers of evil; even
to the vileness of creation and the vile they cause vexation. 4.
Moreover, incalculable is the evil which happens to the vile from the
demons, and that to the good from the demons and also from the vile, and
the mode of its occurrence is in the same way without a demon.

5\. This, too, is more particularly such as the ancients *have* said,
that the labour and trouble of the good are much more in the world, and
their reward *and* recompense are more certain in the spiritual
*existence*; and the comfort and pleasure of the vile are more in the
world, and their pain *and* punishment in the spiritual *existence* are
more severe. 6. And this, too, is *the case*, that the good; through
fear of the pain and punishment of hell, should forsake the comfort and
ease in the world, and should not think, speak, *or* do anything
improper whatever. 7. And through hope for the comfort and pleasure in
heaven they should accept willingly, for the neck <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70), much trouble *and* fear in the practice
of virtue in thought, word, *and* deed.

8\. The vile, through provision with temporary enjoyment <span
id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_71)--even that enjoyment of improprieties for
which eventually there is hell--then enjoy themselves

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

therein temporarily, and lustfully on account of selfishness; those
various actions also, through which *there* would be a way to heaven,
they do not trouble themselves with.

9\. And in this way, in the world, the comfort and pleasure of the vile
are more, and the anxiety, vexation, despondency, and distress of the
good *have* become more; the reason is revealed by the stars <span
id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_72).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_69"></span>[23:1](sbe18014.htm#fr_70) M14 and J have 'but
the worldly evil and bondage are in-calculably more manifest about the
good, much more in the season (zêmânîh) of Srôsh.' The 'season of Srôsh'
may perhaps mean the night-time, or the three nights after death, when
the protection of the angel Srôsh is most wanted; but Dastûr Peshotanji
Behramji, the high-priest of the Parsis in Bombay, prefers reading
zîmânash (with a double pronominal suffix), and has favoured me with the
following free translation of the whole passage:--'At every time and
every place much evil does not happen *to* all the good; for the good,
after having been separated from this world, receive (as a reward for
their suffering evil) much goodness in the next world, which goodness is
(regarded as) of a very high degree in religious doctrines (srôsh).'
Perhaps, after all, Srôsh is a miswriting of saryâ, 'bad, evil.'

<span id="fn_70"></span>[24:1](sbe18014.htm#fr_71) The word can be read
either garêvan, 'collar,' or gardûn, 'neck,' and is the usual Pâz. of
the Huz. *k*avarman (Chald. ‏ו ?Cַ?W.ַ?Rָ?A‎), 'the neck,' though
'neck', is often expressed by gar*d*ûn. The meaning is that the yoke of
trouble and fear should be accepted.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[24:2](sbe18014.htm#fr_72) M14 and J have
'through provision with the enjoyment of improprieties which is
temporarily theirs.'

<span id="fn_72"></span>[25:1](sbe18014.htm#fr_73) That is, it is
dependent upon destiny.
