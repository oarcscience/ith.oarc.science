### CHAPTER XXIII.

1\. The twenty-second question is that which you ask thus: When they
shall snatch forth the life from the body of man how does it depart?

2\. The reply is this, that *it* is said *to be* in resemblance such as
when the redness is drawn up out of a fire; for when the inflammable
*material* of a fire is burnt, *and has* remained without glowing <span
id="fr_149"></span>[3](#fn_148),

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

and when it does not obtain new inflammable *material*, or extinguishing
*matter* (nî*z*âyi*s*nîk) comes upon *it*, its redness *and* heat then
depart from it <span id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_149); the life, too, on
the departure of the breath (vâ*d*ŏ va*s*akîh), does not stay in the
body, *but in* like manner departs.

3\. *To* a like purport the high-priests of the religion *have* also
said this, that mortals *and* men by listening <span
id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_150) perceive the time when the spirits shall
put a noose (band) on the neck <span id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_151);
when his time *has* fully come *one* then conducts him with a companion
(pavan ham-bar) <span id="fr_153"></span>[4](#fn_152), and at his
falling are the place of death <span id="fr_154"></span>[5](#fn_153) and
cause of death; and *having* made lethargy (bûshâsp) deliver him up, and
terrified his fever (tapŏ), death (aôsh) seizes decrepitude (zarmân)
*away* from him <span id="fr_155"></span>[6](#fn_154).

4\. The strength in those intrusted *with him*, and the good proceedings
*and* pursuit of means which remain behind <span
id="fr_156"></span>[7](#fn_155), giving them strength, are the
determination

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (vi*k*îr) which is
their own inward physician. 5. And should it be a passing *away*
(vi*d*arg) which obtains no light, and on account of their disquietudes
*they have* gone to the understanders of remedies for strength for the
remedial duties, and the way is closed, he proceeds with insufficiency
of means <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_156). 6. And the soul of the
body, which is the master of *its* house (ka*d*ak khû*d*âî), *along*
with the animating life, *goes* out of the impotent body to the immortal
souls <span id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_157), as a wise master of a house
goes out of a foreign (anîrânŏ) house to a residence of the good
worship.

7\. *It was* also told to the ancient learned that life (khayâ) is where
there is a living spirit within the soul's body, which is connected with
the soul <span id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_158), as much as a development
(*s*arîtûntanŏ) of the body, and is the life (zîvandakîh) of the soul of
a body of *one* passed *away*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_148"></span>[51:3](sbe18030.htm#fr_149) Reading abarî*s*
(compare Pers bar*z*, 'splendour'), or it may be abarâkh, 'sparkless,'
if barkh, 'a spark,' be a pure Persian word, which is doubtful.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[52:1](sbe18030.htm#fr_150) M14 and J omit the
remainder of the sentence.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[52:2](sbe18030.htm#fr_151) Reading
*s*invi*s*nŏ, but by omitting a stroke we should have dâni*s*nŏ,
'knowledge.'

<span id="fn_151"></span>[52:3](sbe18030.htm#fr_152) Of a person at the
point of death. The demon of death, Astôvîdâ*d* is supposed to cast a
noose around the necks of the dead to drag them to hell, which only the
righteous can throw off (see Bd. III, 21, 22).

<span id="fn_152"></span>[52:4](sbe18030.htm#fr_153) That is, the dying
man must be conveyed by more than one person, for fear of such
contamination by the demon of corruption (at the time of death) as would
require the tedious Bareshnûm ceremonial of purification (see Sls. II,
1, 6-8).

<span id="fn_153"></span>[52:5](sbe18030.htm#fr_154) And, therefore, the
place where his body will rise again at the resurrection (see Sls. XVII,
11-14).

<span id="fn_154"></span>[52:6](sbe18030.htm#fr_155) Lethargy, fever,
and decrepitude are considered as fiends, but are dispossessed by the
mightier demon of death. M14 and J mention 'lethargy,' but omit the
after part of the sentence.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[52:7](sbe18030.htm#fr_156) Alluding probably
to the ceremonies to be ordered and performed by the survivors (see
Chap. XXVIII, 6, Sls. XVII, 2-6).

<span id="fn_156"></span>[53:1](sbe18030.htm#fr_157) That is, when there
are doubts about the fate of the soul, and the survivors can obtain no
satisfactory assurances from the priesthood, the soul has to proceed to
the other world without suitable provision for its happiness.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[53:2](sbe18030.htm#fr_158) The MSS. have
'soul.'

<span id="fn_158"></span>[53:3](sbe18030.htm#fr_159) M14 and J have
'which is the soul,' and omit the remainder of the sentence.
