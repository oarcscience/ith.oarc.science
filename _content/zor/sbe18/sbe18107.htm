<p>1. <I>As to</I> that which is written in that epistle, that in the teaching of S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns he thus states, that 'of both the purifiers necessary he is suitable by whom the ritual is performed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1167"></A><A HREF="#fn_1163"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,' they have been similarly very unanimous that when one is incapable (at&ucirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1168"></A><A HREF="#fn_1164"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> it is the other <I>that</I> is suitable, who is written <I>of</I> in connection with him; and that, moreover, because the statement of Afarg is in a teaching of his&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1169"></A><A HREF="#fn_1165"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and, on</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_302"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 302</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that account, that declaration of his seemed <I>to be</I> from him, which is as though <I>it were</I> decided by him. 2. Then, when <I>one</I> reaches the eulogistic (afr&acirc;s&icirc;n&acirc;k&#335;) reply of his re-explainer, owing to his just will it is itself well perceived that Afarg comes into account as one of the high-priests; and that which is the special teaching of S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns <I>has</I> mentioned that they have been very unanimous that when there is one he would be suitable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1170"></A><A HREF="#fn_1166"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>3. That evidence, too, which many high-priests, and especially one teaching, are alike diffusing, is stated also in the teaching of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h, that when he who is washing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1171"></A><A HREF="#fn_1167"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> understands the profession, then one purifier is plenty for him. 4. When it is abundantly declared, in particular by two teachings, <I>that</I> when there is one he is suitable, <I>it</I> is then not to be rendered quite inoperative through the solitary statement of Afarg; for Afarg only said, as it appeared so to him himself, <I>that</I> 'two purifiers are requisite&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1172"></A><A HREF="#fn_1168"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.' 5. The customs of another high-priest are not declared to exist with like evidence; and this is set aside (sp&ecirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) even by him himself, that another custom is not suitable to exist, because his own view is mentioned as it appeared to him.</p>  
<p>6. Those of the primitive faith have been fully&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1173"></A><A HREF="#fn_1169"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of the custom that other <I>one</I> selected, as to this, where <I>it</I> is the performance of the V&icirc;kaya ('exorcism')&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1174"></A><A HREF="#fn_1170"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; because its explanation is this, that an</p>

<p>opinion upon which the priests (magav&ocirc;g&acirc;n&#335;) are without dispute is that which he says is the custom of a priest, <I>and</I> the business of the two priests, of whose other custom he speaks as much, is a performance by those two witnesses indicating the same as the priest.</p>  
<p>7. This, too, is evident, that, by confession of Afarg, when there is <I>only</I> one purifier <I>he</I> is to be considered as being suitable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1175"></A><A HREF="#fn_1171"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; <I>and</I> an attainment <I>to</I> more evidence is that which is written by you, that M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h <I>has</I> said that every customary <I>part</I> (p&icirc;<I>s</I>ak&#335;) is to be washed three times&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1176"></A><A HREF="#fn_1172"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and now the purifiers <I>do it</I> once. 8. That teaching remains <I>in</I> the same manner as written by him, but the three-fold washing of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h is not a washing to be striven for, but <I>one</I> to be well considered, <I>of</I> which he spoke; and this, too, is not said by him, that when <I>one</I> shall not wash three times it is not proper&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1177"></A><A HREF="#fn_1173"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 9. Afarg said that when <I>one</I> shall&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1178"></A><A HREF="#fn_1174"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> wash once it is proper, and about this once the opinion of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h is the after statement, and the opinion of Afarg is the prior statement; <I>and</I> since in the life of man the first <I>thing</I> to be considered is about purity, not the indispensability of washing, and, further, the</p>

<p>pollution diminishes, about which it speaks in the religious cleansing, during so many times washing <I>as</I> is declared, then the consideration of it is a consideration about the one time which is the first computation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1179"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fn_1175"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 10. That which mentions more than once washing is a contradiction of the prior deponent, not a declaration; <I>and</I> the consideration of that operation, so long as <I>it is</I> declared, is about the statement of him who <I>has</I> mentioned once washing with the opinion of a prior deponent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1180"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fn_1176"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, owing to the same <I>reasons</I>. 11 . But if it be even that much washing which is the merit of the operation, then the statement of Afarg about these times&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1181"></A><A HREF="sbe18108.htm#fn_1177"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is manifestly very preservative, <I>and</I> that of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h is a necessity for declaration.</p>
