<p>1. <I>As to</I> the thirty-eighth question and reply, that which you ask is thus What are the reason and cause of tying <I>on</I> the <I>sacred thread</I>-girdle (k&ucirc;st&icirc;k&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> which, when they shall tie <I>it</I> on is said <I>to be</I> so greatly valuable, and when they shall not tie <I>it</I> the sin is so grievous?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that the all-good, most spiritual of spirits, and most ruling of rulers is the creator, and there is no need of troubles for men of the poor as to any wealth <I>or</I> anything, for all are his own. 3. And through his will <I>as</I> ruler, and all-powerful, he demands this of men, to remain properly</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A></p>  
<p>skirted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_454"></A><A HREF="#fn_452"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as a true servant not even bound--which is due to that service, and also the indication of a servant--as is seen <I>and</I> clearly declared in the ever-fixed (ham&acirc;&icirc;-d&acirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) religion and belief.</p>  
<p>4. Formerly men paid homage through the will and worship, as <I>it were</I> more effectually, more essentially, <I>and</I> more suitably for the discreet; and every day <I>spent</I> in worship offered and homage paid they account as <I>of</I> the greatest use, particularly for observing the world, and understanding <I>its</I> character. 5. And <I>as to him</I> of whose offering of homage no worldly advantage whatever is apparent--as fruit is apparent from trees, flavour from foods, fragrance from aromatic herbs, tint (b&acirc;m) from colours, the good quality of spears from the forest, health from the patient (m&ocirc;lvarak&acirc;n), and decision from words--but, audibly speaking, <I>his</I> head is lowered in sign of humility--as though the head, which is uppermost in the body and in the most pre-eminent <I>position</I>, and is lowered as far even as the sole of the foot, which is lowermost in the body, salutes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_455"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>and</I> is placed on the ground in thought about worship <I>and</I> desire of paying homage--and the appearance which exists as regards himself through <I>that</I> lowliest (k&icirc;hast&#335;) servitude is <I>in accordance</I> with that which is apparent from trees, food, and the many other worldly advantages <I>before</I> recited--whoever <I>has</I> offered homage and such advantageous (v&ecirc;<I>s</I>i<I>s</I>nak&#335;) appearance</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is manifest--even then that sign of humility <I>and</I> servitude is <I>what</I> great multitudes consider the offering of homage of a man more essential for hypocrisy (sh&ecirc;d&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_454"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>6. <I>But</I> owing to that which <I>happens</I> when they plant a tree in the name of a sacred being&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_455"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and eat the produce, and practise other worldly labour of worldly advantage, owing also to work of this kind through the doing of which they preserve all the growing <I>crops</I> of the whole world, and through tillage and multitudinous cultivated plots (kh&ucirc;stak&icirc;h&acirc;) <I>it</I> is manifest that they should meditate inwardly (d&ecirc;n m&icirc;n&#335;y&ecirc;n)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_458"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 7. A token <I>and</I> sign of worship is <I>of</I> great use, and a great assistance (ban<I>g</I>i<I>s</I>n&#335;) therein is this belt (band), which is called the K&ucirc;st&icirc;k, that is tied on the middle of the body.</p>  
<p>8. The reasons of the assistance are numerous; and its first assistance is this, that <I>as to</I> him who--<I>as</I> a worshipper of the sacred beings, owing to the undeceitful (akadb&acirc;) religion whose indication is sagaciously propitiating with the <I>purifying</I> cup&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>--wears upon the body that spiritual, customary, and</p>

<p><A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A></p>  
<p>doctrinal indication of the sacred beings with a wisdom which is truly religion, <I>his</I> steadfastness and religious service of the sacred beings are audibly spoken thereby; even for the religious <I>it</I> is commanded, because <I>it</I> is an assisting motive of beneficial high-priests and such-like submitters <I>to</I> the commands of the religion of the sacred beings.</p>  
<p>9. One is this, that, as the lowliest servant and greatest lord are steadily agreed, and <I>it is</I> beneficial&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="#fn_458"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> when they (the servants) wear a belt upon the body <I>as</I> a sign of service--because <I>it</I> is not the custom to grant that little at any time without guardianship--the lapse of which service is also not a beneficial lapse, then those unbound are without a token of the lord's service.</p>  
<p>10. One is this, that it is commanded in revelation to keep thought, word, and deed confined from sin by a belt, and just like a servant; for the sake of confinement of sins from purity of thought, whose dwelling is the heart, <I>one</I> is to wear the same belt, which is the token of a servant, <I>on</I> the middle of the body and before the heart; and the periodical (hang&acirc;m&icirc;k&acirc;n&#335;) sight of the token and sign of confined sins, and of the constant reminder for <I>one's</I> own mind, is the necessity of wearing <I>it</I> as a belt which is very restraining from the sin in thought, word, and deed that is manifest even in experience; which wearing of the same belt is as a reason and cause of much remembrance of much sin, that in the same way is therefore a restraint of it.</p>  
<p>II. One is this, that the ancients acquainted with religion <I>have</I> communicated these tidings (sr&ocirc;b&#335;)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A></p>  
<p>unto our ancestors <I>and</I> to us:--'When the destroyer came upon the creatures, the demons and witches (par&icirc;k&#335;) especially rushed up in the earth and atmosphere, and even to <I>just</I> below the position of the stars; and they saw multitudes of luminaries, and also the barricade <I>and</I> rampart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_461"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the glory of the religion, and the girdle (parvand)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_462"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of the wishes <I>and</I> good works of all, when&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_461"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> it is arrayed like a brilliant <I>thread</I>-girdle (k&ucirc;st&icirc;k), and all its luminaries are girded (parvast&#335;) by the girdle as the girdle of the omniscient wisdom has girded the all-intelligent angels.' 12. That great glory of the pure religion, solving doubts, became as beautiful and far-adorning as is stated in the liturgy (m&acirc;nsar) thus: 'The star-studded girdle (ay&icirc;<I>v</I>yah&acirc;ng&acirc;n&#335;) of the spirit-fashioned, good religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.' 13. All the demons and fiends <I>were</I> terrified by the great glory of the religion, <I>and it is</I> said that, by the recital, practice, <I>and</I> promulgation of the whole routine of the enlightened religion, all those fiends are subdued, <I>and</I> the renovation <I>of the universe</I> is produced by the will of the patron spirits (ahv&acirc;n). 14. Likewise, on account of that terror, none of the demons and fiends, who are the mightiest of the demons, rushed upon the creatures of that uppermost third <I>of the sky</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, who are in purity and indestructibility.</p>

And it (the girdle) is commanded in revelation for men, more particularly for upholders of the religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <I>to be</I> within the middle third <I>and</I> near to the uppermost third of the body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_467"></A><A HREF="#fn_465"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>16. <I>One is</I> this, that Yim the splendid, <I>son</I> of V&icirc;vangha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_468"></A><A HREF="#fn_466"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, who in <I>his</I> worldly career was most prosperous in worldly affairs, a keeper away of all agitations of temper&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="#fn_467"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> <I>and</I> all death, <I>and</I> a provider of freedom from decay <I>and</I> exemption from death, when he was deceived by the fiend <I>was</I> thereby made eager for supreme sovereignty instead of the service of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>. 17. And about his administration (d&acirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r&icirc;h) of the creatures <I>it</I> is said he himself became cut&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_470"></A><A HREF="#fn_468"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> away from radiant glory by that fiendishness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_471"></A><A HREF="#fn_469"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and their cause of wandering</p>

And his pardon originated from the fully-persistent creator; therefore he spoke <I>and</I> gave advice unto his successors as to the retribution of those <I>who</I> shall abandon the service of the creator; and therein is explained about the fortress of the angels&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_473"></A><A HREF="#fn_471"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, with the many proper actions which are the strength of the fortress, and about the proportional way it is strengthened when a belt worn on the waist is ordered for men <I>by</I> him--the fully glorious ruler who was lord of the world, and also in gloriousness well-betokening the good creation--<I>and</I> they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_474"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> likewise order <I>it</I>.</p>  
<p>19. One is this, that just as through that reason&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_475"></A><A HREF="#fn_473"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, which is an appointment (pa<I>d</I>&#335;-dahi<I>s</I>n&#335;) that the sacred beings decreed, the <I>sacred thread</I>-girdle <I>was</I> worn even before the coming of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t the Sp&icirc;tam&acirc;n, <I>so</I> after <I>the coming of</I> that messenger (vakh<I>s</I>var) of the sacred beings, the righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t--who enjoined the commands of the good spirits <I>and</I> the exposition of the religion, with discourse praising the sacred beings and scriptures (a<I>v</I>&icirc;st&acirc;k&#335;) about steadfastness in the good religion--the same religious girdle is put on, with a religious formula&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_474"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, around</p>

<p>the body, over the garment of Voh&ucirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_475"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 20. Because the same intimation, relative to girding (parvandi<I>s</I>n&icirc;k) is wisdom for which the race of the religion is so justly famed that innumerable people, with the same customs <I>and</I> equally proper girding, wear the <I>sacred thread</I>-girdle, the ceremonial belt of the religion <I>and</I> indication of the creator, on the middle of the body; <I>and</I> it becomes more destructive of the power of destruction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, more obstructive of the way to sin, and more contesting (kastaktar) the will of the demons.</p>  
<p>21. One is this, that <I>he</I> is unwise that <I>has</I> not worn <I>it</I> when that <I>man has</I> arrived in whose law no belting and no girdling&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are ordered, and more perplexing and more grievous destruction is so manifested at the time, that <I>it</I> is similar evidence to that exposition of revelation, the purport (a&ecirc;v&acirc;<I>z</I>) of <I>whose</I> question <I>and</I> reply is spoken thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>:--'"O creator! in whom is the manifestation of secretly-progressing destruction, that is, in whom is its progress&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>?" And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: "In him who is the guide of a vile religion; whoever it is who puts on a girdle</p>

<p>at most thrice (3-t&ucirc;mak) in a year&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, that is, he does not wear a <I>sacred</I> shirt and <I>thread</I>-girdle, and his law also is this, that it is not necessary to wear <I>them</I>"'--and when the law of no belting is so grievous that, when that law shall be accepted, it is observed <I>that</I> destruction is strengthened.</p>  
<p>22. The same belt, kept on after the command of Yim, <I>was</I> the first token as regards which an annihilator of destruction is mentioned <I>and</I> established by law; <I>and on</I> both occasions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> destruction is more grievously manifest. 23. That which is more particularly important is such as the destroyer of destruction, Yim the splendid, advised, which the high-priest of the good, Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t the Sp&icirc;tam&acirc;n, mentioned thus:--'The <I>sacred thread</I>-girdle is as a sign of the service of the sacred beings, a token of sin ended, and a presage of beneficence; <I>and one is</I> to put <I>it</I> on <I>and</I> to gird <I>it</I>, in the neighbourhood of the heart and <I>on</I> the middle of the body, with the religious formula accompanying the glorious scripture.' 24. That is also betokened by <I>its</I> equally-dividing (hamb&ucirc;r) position and determining fashion; for, as a wise man becomes a discriminator between benefit <I>and</I> injury, between good and evil, so also the place of the <I>sacred thread</I>-girdle is between below and above. 25. With a low <I>sacred</I> girdle there is a passage for one's want of openness (av&icirc;sh&ocirc;<I>d</I>an&#335;) and secret ruin, and also a shutting up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of life; with a high <I>sacred</I>&nbsp;</p>

<p>girdle there is a way <I>for</I> thought, word, and deed, and no confinement (ag&icirc;ri<I>s</I>n&#335;k&acirc;r&icirc;h) of life; and tying the <I>sacred</I> girdle with a religious rite (hamd&icirc;n&#335;) is like a glory amid the glories <I>of</I> the angels, for it is itself through the aid of the patron spirit (ahv&ocirc;). 26. And from the heart, which is the place of thought and dwelling of life, on the upper side (l&acirc;l&acirc;&icirc;h) are the eye, ear, tongue, <I>and</I> brain, which are the dwellings of sight, hearing, speech, understanding, and intellect; and on its lower side (fr&ocirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;h)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_485"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is the abode of a father's generativeness.</p>  
<p>27. When this <I>sacred thread</I>-girdle, whose token, sign, and presage are such&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_484"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, is tied, it is girded on with this glorious rite&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_485"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of the glorious ones, the custom of the learned, the command of rulers, and the decree of apostles.</p>  
<p>28. That secretly-progressing destruction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, which <I>arises</I> from the fiend of insubordination (asa<I>r</I>d&acirc;r&icirc;h)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> who <I>was</I> much afraid of Yim, <I>and</I> which is averse to the labour of men <I>and</I> the service of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, is a demon and irreligious (d&ucirc;<I>s</I>-d&icirc;n&ocirc;), who is full of fear of the girdles (parvand&icirc;h&acirc;) of the glory of</p>

<p>religion, <I>with</I> which both angels <I>and</I> also worldlings <I>have</I> become belted <I>and</I> diligent.</p>  
<p>29. Then, because the glory for this belt of ours, which is called the K&ucirc;st&icirc;k and is worn on the middle of the body, remains unreleased (a<I>v</I>&icirc;-v&ucirc;kht) from the angels, who are givers of glory, <I>and from</I> men who are glorious--which is explained as a similitude <I>and</I> sample of fortunes (b&acirc;harak&#335;&icirc;h&acirc;) among worldlings, even those <I>who are</I> actually primitive creatures likewise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--it <I>has</I>, therefore, seemed comely and desirable. 30. And their heart, will, knowledge, and purpose are as much for it as that which is perceptible where, even apart from those of the good religion who shall tie the <I>sacred thread</I>-girdle with the scripture formula, <I>some</I> of the faiths of all countries, except those who are unbelted, possess the religious custom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 31. Also outside the seat of the existence of faith&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> all men have the waist, or the palms of the hands&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, or similar joints for a girdle (k&ucirc;st&icirc;k&#335;); <I>and</I> it is deemed comely, desirable, and convenient for work to wear <I>it</I>. 32. And <I>it</I> is manifestly the lot (dak&#335;) of the thoroughly-praising one whose own desire is truth and the enjoyment of welfare, <I>it is</I> a token of the service of the sacred beings, and a sign of walking <I>in</I> the commands of religion,</p>

<p>which they shall tie on account of the superior beings (p&acirc;sh&ucirc;m&acirc;n) with the proper formula, more particularly <I>with</I> that which <I>one</I> utters when <I>there is</I> reliance <I>upon</I> the scripture itself.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_451"></A><A HREF="sbe18046.htm#fr_453">122:1</A> The K&ucirc;st&icirc;k (Pers. kust&icirc;) consists of a string, about the size of a stay-lace, which is first passed twice round the waist very loosely, over the sacred shirt (see Chap. XL, 2), and tied in front with a loose double knot (right-handed and left-handed), and the long ends are then passed a third time round the waist and tied again behind with a similar double knot. This string contains six strands, each consisting of twelve very fine, white, woollen threads twisted together, or seventy-two threads in all. Near each end the six strands are braided together, instead of being twisted, and for the last inch they are braided into three separate string-ends of two strands each; these string-ends, therefore, contain twenty-four threads each, and form a kind of fringed end to the string. This fringe is a sort of remembrancer, as its six strands are supposed to symbolize the six G&acirc;hanb&acirc;rs or season-festivals, the twelve threads in each strand symbolize the twelve months, the twenty-four threads in each string-end symbolize the twenty-four kar<I>d</I>aks or sections of the Vispara<I>d</I>, and the seventy-two threads in the whole string symbolize the seventy-two his or chapters of the Yasna. The girdle has to be re-tied every time the hands have been washed, which, in order to comply with the ceremonial laws, occurs many times in the day; and each time it has to be done with ceremony and a particular formula of prayer (see &sect; 27).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_455"></A><A HREF="sbe18046.htm#fr_457">124:2</A> Whether y&ecirc;dat&ocirc; means 'an angel,' or 'God,' is here uncertain.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_460"></A><A HREF="sbe18046.htm#fr_462">126:2</A> It is not certain that parvand signifies 'a girdle,' or that parvastan&#335; means 'to gird,' but they seem to be used in that sense here. The former word translates Av. paurvan&icirc;m, 'leading the Pleiades' (Haug's Essays, p. 182), in Yas. IX, 81, an epithet applied to the belt of Orion.</P>
