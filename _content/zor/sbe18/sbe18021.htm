<p>1. The twelfth question is that which you ask thus: In the fourth night do they score off (ba<I>r</I>&acirc; ang&acirc;r&ecirc;nd) the sin by the good works, and does he go by the residue (b&ocirc;n); or do they inflict punishment on him for the sin which <I>has</I> happened to him, and give reward <I>and</I> recompense for the good works which he <I>has</I> done?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that at dawn of the third night the account is prepared it is said, and about the sin which he <I>has</I> atoned for, <I>and</I> the good work which is its equivalent (&acirc;<I>v</I>&acirc;r) <I>there</I> is no need for account, since the account is about the good works which may be appropriated by him <I>as</I> his own, and about the sin which may remain <I>in</I> him as <I>its</I> origin. 3. Because the origin of it (the sin atoned for) remains distinct, and it is cancelled (astar<I>d</I>&#335;)</p>

<p>by it (the good work), they balance it therewith; and they weigh the excess and deficiency, as it may be, of the <I>other</I> good works <I>and</I> sin.</p>  
<p>4. Of those living, at the just, impartial (a<I>k</I>afsi<I>s</I>n&#335;) balance the <I>man</I> of proper habits (d&acirc;<I>d</I>&#335;), whose good works are more, when sin <I>has</I> happened to him, undergoes a temporary (vidan&acirc;&icirc;k) punishment and becomes eternally cleansed by the good works; and he of improper habits, of much sin and little good works, attains temporary enjoyment by those good works, <I>but</I> through the sin which they perceive <I>in</I> him he is suffering punishment unto the resurrection.</p>
