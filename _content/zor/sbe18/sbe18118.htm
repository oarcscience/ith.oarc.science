<p>1. When at <I>any</I> time I write more pleasantly, this directs <I>you</I> to understand that still with the steadfast, are my affection and natural lowly-mindedness; afterwards, too, that which <I>happens</I> when you have kept me wide away from the way of brotherhood, and higher even than a father, master, leader, ruler, <I>or</I> high-priest, is due to the fame and happiness of</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_349"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 349</FONT></A></p>  
<p>my body <I>and</I> life, not <I>to</I> affection of character, but the position of religion <I>and</I> the command of the sacred beings. 2. On that account, when you have seen the pure religiousness, the learned knowledge, <I>and</I> the repose-promoting truth of the invisible (av&ecirc;n&acirc;p&icirc;h) <I>of</I> which my&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1357"></A><A HREF="#fn_1352"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> heart is leaping with evidence, so that you are steadfast even unto the n&ocirc;i<I>d</I> asta-<I>k</I>a ('not though the body') <I>of</I> which Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t the Sp&icirc;tam&acirc;n spoke&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1358"></A><A HREF="#fn_1353"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>--and, because, turned by me to the religion which is thy passport (parv&acirc;nak&#335;) to the best existence, you have understood <I>that</I> it is the organizer of the greatest protection, <I>even</I> that is supposed by me--I undergo all the terror of the period in hope of the supreme recompense.</p>  
<p>3. And the position that that religion <I>has</I> given, which on that account is mine, you have that way considered as supremacy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1359"></A><A HREF="#fn_1354"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; and if, sent from you or another person, the opposition of <I>one of</I> the same religion is seen <I>to be</I> the dispersion and disruption of the appointed profession, I act against the continuance of the opposition, and as steadfastly as the series (zarah) of submissiveness and gratification of <I>your</I> priestly lordship <I>has</I> done to me. 4. And this <I>will</I> be undoubtedly realised by you, that if you do not turn away from this decree which is not preservative, but, <I>being</I> appointed, I reach out from</p>

<p>the country of Ir&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1360"></A><A HREF="#fn_1355"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, then I <I>shall</I> become its greatest attacker of you. 5. And so I consider that from my opposition it is possible <I>for</I> more harm to happen unto you than from many accusers who are like the leader of those of the good religion, the many who are as <I>it were</I> of like fame with me.</p>  
<p>6. And also from my departure, and the non-existence <I>of one</I> that is a friend of yours, who, like me, is less able to be for your harm than he who is <I>one</I> of the many accusers of whom it is I who am the restrainer, you know this, that my coming is on account of the affection of some and the reverence of others. 7. From the exercise of religion I do not at all fall <I>away</I>, and for the sake of the position of the religion I am maintaining opposition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1361"></A><A HREF="#fn_1356"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to any one; even when he is a friend <I>who</I> is loved by me, I am then his antagonist 8. Fate (z&icirc;k&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1362"></A><A HREF="#fn_1357"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is the great truth of the vacant, the form (and&acirc;m)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1363"></A><A HREF="#fn_1358"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> which <I>has</I> procured the light of life.</p>
