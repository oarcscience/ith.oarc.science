<p>1. <I>As to</I> the sixty-ninth question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: What are these river-beds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_790"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and what is the cause of them; whence do they always arise, <I>and</I> why is <I>there</I> not a river-bed every-where <I>and in</I> every place where <I>there</I> is no mountain?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that any place where a mountain is not discernible and a river-bed exists <I>it</I> is a fissure (a<I>s</I>k&ucirc;p&#335;); and it is declared as clear that, even before the growth of the mountains, when the earth was all a plain, <I>by</I> the shaking of the world the whole world became rent (zandak&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_791"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 3.

VIII, 1-5); and at the resurrection it is expected that the earth will recover its original perfect state of a level plain (see Bd. XXX, 33).</P>

He is often mentioned as constructing canals (see Bd. XX, 17, 34, XXI, 6), but being a foreign conqueror he was considered as specially wicked by the Ir&acirc;nians.</P>
