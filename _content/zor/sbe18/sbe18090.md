### CHAPTER LXXXIII.

1\. *As to* the eighty-second question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: Is it necessary for a priestly man <span
id="fr_921"></span>[1](#fn_918) *that* he should undertake all the
religious rites and other ceremonials, or in what way is it?

2\. The reply is this, that a priestly man should necessarily undertake
all the religious rites *and* other ceremonials, because the deciding
and advising performers of the ceremonial, *these* same priestly men,
well understand the merit *or* demerit, the propriety *or* impropriety,
of the ceremonial. 3. When the undertaker *and* conductor of all the
religious rites is a priestly man, *one* is more hopeful of *their*
progress in merit.

4\. *As to* the priestly man who shall undertake all the religious
rites, if *he be* living comfortably (hû-zîvi*s*nŏ) on a share of our
house-rulership <span id="fr_922"></span>[2](#fn_919),

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

village-rulership, tribe-rulership, and province-rulership, and his
needful support of religion remain the consideration as to his living
comfortably, and he have no need for the stipend of all the religious
rites, then the rule for him is to distribute properly that recompense
of the sacred feast <span id="fr_923"></span>[1](#fn_920), which is to
be given *for* all the religious rites, among the solemnizers <span
id="fr_924"></span>[2](#fn_921). 5. If *it be* needful for him, the
priestly man, as he is suitable, is not changed--whereby good management
is not attained--and *if it be* needful even for his consideration of
all those religious rites, his performance in the duty and ministration
is then an approval of worthiness *and* management. 6. When they shall
act so, all those religious rites are more meritoriously managed; and
one day the solemnizers are brought from the fag-end (sar) into the rank
of priestly manhood, which is the stipend for all the religious rites
that they shall expressly take authorisedly, and are, therefore, worthy
of it  <span id="fr_925"></span>[3](#fn_922).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_918"></span>[244:1](sbe18090.htm#fr_921) The term
magavôg-gab*r*â probably means strictly 'a man of a priestly family,' as
distinguished from a priest appointed from -the laity, an appointment
that seems to have been occasionally made informer times (see Bd.
Introd. p. xxxiii, note 1). According to the Nîrangistân any virtuous
man or woman can perform certain priestly duties under certain
circumstances (see Sls. X, 35), but would not, of course, be magavôg,
'priestly, or of priestly family.'

<span id="fn_919"></span>[244:2](sbe18090.htm#fr_922) Reading mânpatîh,
instead of magôpatîh, 'priesthood,' which words are often confounded in
Pahlavi, being written very nearly alike. And assuming that hatŏm, 'if
my,' stands for hatŏmân, 'if our;' M14 has atûkhsh, 'without exertion,'
but hatŏ*s*, 'if his,' would be a more probable emendation, as it occurs
in the next section.

<span id="fn_920"></span>[245:1](sbe18090.htm#fr_923) See Chap. XLVII,
1.

<span id="fn_921"></span>[245:2](sbe18090.htm#fr_924) That is, if the
chief priest has already a sufficient income, he is not to appropriate
the fees for such occasional ceremonies, but to distribute them among
his assistants, who are the actual solemnizers.

<span id="fn_922"></span>[245:3](sbe18090.htm#fr_925) That is, when the
chief priest requires the fees for his own support, the reward of his
assistants must be the fact that they are rendering themselves competent
to undertake the responsibility of the chief priest at some future time.
