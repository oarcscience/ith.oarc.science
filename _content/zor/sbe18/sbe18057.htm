<p>1. The forty-ninth question is that you ask thus: <I>If</I> they should sell wine unto foreigners and infidels what is then the decision <I>about</I> it?</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A></p>

But if through the operation of that wine-selling of theirs the wine is kept more away from those who become worse through immoderate drinking of wine, <I>and</I> comes to those who drink wine in moderation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_666"></A><A HREF="#fn_663"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--<I>whom</I> they cause to become better through drinking the wine--more than when they shall not practise that selling of the wine, then through that selling of theirs the power which is in the wealth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_667"></A><A HREF="#fn_664"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, by their keeping away of which a man is confirmed (pa<I>d</I>ay&icirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) in the good religion and diverted from going into infidelity, the progress of sin is impeded <I>and</I> good works are promoted, becomes the assistance of the good and protection of religion, the hindrance of sin and aid of good works, which, when they shall not practise that wine-selling, do not arise, <I>and</I> which are much more promoted than the various sins that might have arisen from the unlawfully drinking of wine. 4. Or, otherwise, the greater decision--and great are the good works which are assured therein--is thus: 'They who shall sell wine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_668"></A><A HREF="#fn_665"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to foreigners, infidels, and others from whom unlawful conduct arises through drunkenness, <I>act</I> very sinfully and not authorisedly.'</p>
