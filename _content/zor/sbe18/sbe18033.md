### CHAPTER XXVI.

1\. The twenty-fifth question is that which you ask thus: How are the
nature of heaven (vahi*s*tô), *and* the comfort and pleasure which are
in heaven?

2\. The reply is this, that *it is* lofty, exalted, and

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

supreme, most brilliant, most fragrant, and most pure, most *supplied
with* beautiful existences, most desirable, and most good, and the place
*and* abode of the sacred beings (ya*zd*ânŏ). 3. And in it are all
comfort, pleasure, joy, happiness (vasî*d*âgîh), and welfare, more *and*
better even than the greatest *and* supremest welfare *and* pleasure in
the world; and there is no want, pain, distress, *or* discomfort
whatever *in* it; and its pleasantness and the welfare of the angels are
from that constantly-beneficial place (gâs), the full *and*
undiminishable space (gûn*g*) <span id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_171), the
good and boundless world.

4\. And the .freedom of the heavenly from danger from evil in heaven is
like unto *their* freedom from disturbance, and the coming of the good
angels is like unto *the heavenly ones'* own good works provided. 5.
This prosperity (freh-hastŏ) and welfare of the spiritual *existence* is
*more* than that of the world, as much as that which is unlimited *and*
everlasting is *more* than that which is limited and demoniacal
(*s*êdânîkŏ).
