<p>1. <I>As to</I> that which is written&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1204"></A><A HREF="#fn_1200"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that it is declared in the Sak&acirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;m <I>Nask</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1205"></A><A HREF="#fn_1201"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, that the consecrated bull's</p>

<p>urine, when it becomes fetid, is to be stirred up (ba<I>r</I>&acirc; ag&acirc;r<I>d</I>&#335;&icirc;ni<I>s</I>n&#335;), <I>and</I> they should not carry <I>it</I> forth so to the fire, so that the stench extends to the fire; because, if that stench extends to the fire, on account of the moisture <I>and</I> through carrying bodily refuse (h&icirc;gar)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1206"></A><A HREF="#fn_1202"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> on and forth to the fire, it overwhelms it; that is taught <I>in</I> like manner lest, and owing to what is said, it then seemed to one that the bodily refuse and pollution of fetid bull's urine is on account of the stench. 2. But it is proper to observe it more fully mindfully, perfectly completely, <I>and</I> with better understanding, because that which is said by it, that the carrying of bodily refuse forth to the fire overwhelms <I>it</I>, is not on account of the pollution of the bull's urine, but the proportion of the sin through this; so that it becomes the origin of as much sin for him as that pollution of the bull's urine; but the stench, on account of moisture, is like <I>him</I> even who shall bring clean <I>and</I> purified water into the fire, <I>and</I> thereby becomes sinful&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1207"></A><A HREF="#fn_1203"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p><A NAME="page_311"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 311</FONT></A></p>  
<p>3. This, too, is a saying, that the proportion of the sin is mentioned not on account of the pollution of the bull's urine; it is said <I>to be</I> a counterpart even of that <I>which</I> is declared of the care of the <I>flesh of the</I> ass and pig, so that when they shall now carry unto the fire more than the proportion which is ordered, it overwhelms <I>it</I> through carrying bodily refuse forth to the fire, and even then that flesh, investigated as to purity, is mentioned as a supply for the season-festival&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1208"></A><A HREF="#fn_1204"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>4. The fetid bull's urine is itself likewise prepared, so that on this account it is ordered that <I>it</I> is to be stirred up, that so long as <I>it</I> is stirred up they <I>may</I> thereupon order the use of it; if then <I>it</I> is to be rendered quite useless, <I>there</I> is afterwards no necessity for stirring it. 5. The stirring is declared a purification as regards polluted <I>things</I>, where bodily refuse is only such that <I>it</I> is not endless, and so pure that it purifies even that of another.</p>  
<p>6. When <I>it</I> is written of it itself, that <I>it</I> is thus declared in the Sak&acirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;m <I>Nask</I>, that consecrated bull's urine which is fetid is to be stirred up for the fire, <I>it</I> is afterwards declared that <I>it</I> is not speaking <I>only of</I> the bull's urine <I>which</I> is provided those three days&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1209"></A><A HREF="#fn_1205"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; but that, too, which is old <I>and</I> consecrated,</p>

<p>become fetid <I>and</I> is stirred again, when they keep it in use, is proper. 7. And that which the Sak&acirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;m <I>has</I> declared is, specially, that one of the high-priests <I>has</I> individually said: 'That stench is mentioned with reference to the <I>occasion</I> when a stench reaches it of a different kind <I>from that</I> which exists naturally in it.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1201"></A><A HREF="sbe18109.htm#fr_1205">309:4</A> This was the eighteenth of the lost books of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers (see Sls. X, 25, note). It was one of the seven law books, and treated of many legal matters. Among the contents of its first thirty sections the following items are mentioned by the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I>, <A NAME="page_310"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 310</FONT></A> and one of these passages probably contained the statement quoted in our text:--'On carrying forth the holy-water and also the pot (d&icirc;g&#335;-<I>k</I>) to the fire, that is, <I>with</I> purified <I>and</I> thoroughly-washed hands; <I>and</I> the sin of carrying <I>them</I> forth with unpurified <I>and</I> imperfectly-washed hands. On preserving the pot and the other <I>things</I>, whose use is with the fire, from defilement with bodily refuse; when, through want of care, defilement occurs, <I>and</I> any one shall carry <I>it</I> unawares to the fire, he who is careless overwhelms <I>it</I> thereby. . . . On lawfully warming the bull's urine on the fire, <I>and</I> the sin when <I>it</I> is not <I>done</I> lawfully.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1202"></A><A HREF="sbe18109.htm#fr_1206">310:1</A> See Dd. XLVIII, 19, note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1203"></A><A HREF="sbe18109.htm#fr_1207">310:2</A> The argument is that the urine being a consecrated liquid, its corruption is not contaminating (provided it be not occasioned by foreign matter, as alluded to in &sect; 7); but if the stench be sufficient to extinguish or injure the fire, it is as sinful to expose the fire to its influence as it would be to injure the fire with holy-water.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1204"></A><A HREF="sbe18109.htm#fr_1208">311:1</A> So the damage to the fire is not occasioned by any impurity of the flesh of the ass or pig (which could be used for a sacred feast), but by the excessive quantity brought to it. The pig was formerly domesticated by the Parsis (see Sls. II, 58), but they have long since adopted the prejudices of the Hindus and Muhammadans as regards its uncleanness.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1205"></A><A HREF="sbe18109.htm#fr_1209">311:2</A> Referring probably to the times of the three washings, subsequent to the chief ceremony, which take place after the third, sixth, and ninth nights, respectively, (see Vend. IX, 136, 140, 144.)</P>
