<p>THE great ceremony of purification for any Parsi man or woman who has become unclean by contact with the dead, or through any other serious defilement, lasts for nine nights, and is called the Bareshn&ucirc;m, which is the Avesta name for the 'top' of the head, the first part of the body appointed to be washed in the ceremony, after the hands. The description of this ceremony, given in Pahl. Vend. IX, I-145, which does not differ very materially from the rite still in use, is as follows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1602"></A><A HREF="#fn_1596"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:--</p>  
<p>Pahl. Vend. IX, 1.

'How, when in the material existence they see a [clean] man together with [that which is polluted], (3) how shall they purify him clean who</p>

<p>4. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'A righteous man, O Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t the Sp&icirc;tam&acirc;n!

At the present time the term magh, which means 'a hole' in the Avesta, is applied to the stones which are used as ablution seats for squatting upon.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1604"></A><A HREF="sbe18126.htm#fr_1610">433:4</A> The greater depth of the hole for catching the ablution droppings in the winter, would provide for the larger quantity of liquid that could not sink into the soil, or evaporate, during the tedious washing, owing to the soil and air being damper than in summer.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1607"></A><A HREF="sbe18126.htm#fr_1613">436:1</A> The arrangement, here described, is that of six holes in a row, one step apart; then an interval of three steps, followed by three more holes, one step apart, in the same line. This row of nine holes, from north to south (see &sect; 232, <i>e</i>), is surrounded by three furrows, the first six holes and the last three are both surrounded by a second series of three furrows, and the first three holes are surrounded by a third series of three furrows. And these furrows are not less than three steps from the holes in any place, except where they separate the three series of holes from each other. The object of the furrows, which are scored during the recitation of certain formulas (see &sect; 132, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>), is to prevent the fiend of corruption from forcing its way from the unclean person within the furrows to any other person outside them. And, as the fiend is supposed to be strongest at first, and to become gradually weakened by the progress of the purification (see &sect; 119), the first three holes are surrounded by the strongest barrier of nine furrows.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1608"></A><A HREF="sbe18126.htm#fr_1614">436:2</A> There were three such spaces, one between the furrows and the first hole, one between the sixth and seventh holes, and one between the last hole and the furrows (see the plan). It is not distinctly stated that these stones were to be distributed, as ablution seats, to each of the nine stations, as at present; but this was probably intended. At the present time an additional group of stones is placed outside the furrows, at the entrance to the north, as a station for the preliminary washing.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1609"></A><A HREF="sbe18126.htm#fr_1615">436:3</A> That is, the priest is to stand outside, to the right (see &sect; 132, <i>i</i>), but close to the furrows.</P>
