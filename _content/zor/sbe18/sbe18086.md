### CHAPTER LXXIX.

1\. *As to* the seventy-eighth question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: What is the decision *about* water *with* the *word* Ithâ <span
id="fr_872"></span>[1](#fn_869) and *him who* shall drink it? 2. When a
man *has* performed his ritual *and* does not take the prayer (vâ*g*ŏ)
*inwardly, but* drinks water with the *word* Ithâ, what is the decision
*about* this efficacy <span id="fr_873"></span>[2](#fn_870) of which he
takes up one half *and* abandons one half, how is it necessary, or not,
to consider *it*, and what is the sin of it? 3. *As to him* who performs
half, *or* less than half, of the efficacy, *and* drinks water with the
*word* Ithâ, what is the retribution for this sin when he shall commit
*it* occasionally, *and* what is good *in order* that this sin, when he
shall commit *it*, may depart from *its* source?

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

4\. *As to him* who *has* performed his Nâbar <span
id="fr_874"></span>[1](#fn_871) ritual, *and* drinks water with the
*word* Ithâ, not muttering (andâkŏ) the *inward* prayer (vâ*g*ŏ), and
performs a ceremony (ya*s*tô), though he does not order a ceremony of
Gêtô-kharî*d* <span id="fr_875"></span>[2](#fn_872) for himself, is the
decision then *about* him anything better, or not; *and* does the good
work of this ceremony of Gêtô-kharî*d* become just the same as *that* of
the Nâbar ceremony, or not? 5. *As to him* who orders a ceremony of
Gêtô-kharî*d* for <span id="fr_876"></span>[3](#fn_873) himself, what is
then his good work, and what is the value <span
id="fr_877"></span>[4](#fn_874) of his worthiness when he does not
himself perform because he orders that they should perform for him? 6.
And *as to* him who has not performed his ceremony, *and* is fifteen
years *old*, what is then the decision *about* him?

7\. The reply is this:--When a man *who has* chanted the Gâthas
('hymns') <span id="fr_878"></span>[5](#fn_875) drinks water with the
*word* Ithâ, if, moreover, *being* preservable *from* suffering <span
id="fr_879"></span>[6](#fn_876), he be not a righteous *one* overwhelmed
by impotence, it is thus said that, when *in order* to consecrate the
sacred cake (drônô) <span id="fr_880"></span>[7](#fn_877) it is not
possible

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

to take the prayer *inwardly*, and *there* are no presentations of it
for the tasting of the virtuous *with inward* prayer <span
id="fr_881"></span>[1](#fn_878) or for the sake of relieving the
sickness of a righteous person, which has come severely, when it is
possible for him *to say* 'Ithâ' *and* one 'Ashem-vohû <span
id="fr_882"></span>[2](#fn_879),' or it is possible for him to say
'Ashem,' *he* is to recite that which it is possible for him to speak,
and *he* is to drink or eat <span id="fr_883"></span>[3](#fn_880) the
water, or food, or medicine which is discreetly his, and may be the
custom of his body and life <span id="fr_884"></span>[4](#fn_881).

8\. But the sinfulness of *him* who *has* drunk water with the *word*
Ithâ, not owing to suffering, is much the most sinful, except this
efficacy of which *you have* written that, *having* taken up <span
id="fr_885"></span>[5](#fn_882) one half, they shall abandon one half;
for, when in eating the efficacy is possessed in that manner, *it* is
then a chattering meal which is a very grievous sin <span
id="fr_886"></span>[6](#fn_883). 9. Every single drop (pashan) <span
id="fr_887"></span>[7](#fn_884) which in that manner comes to the

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

mouth *as* a new taste is *a sin of* three stîrs <span
id="fr_888"></span>[1](#fn_885), and every single *thing* which is
spoken like that word <span id="fr_889"></span>[2](#fn_886) is a sin of
three stîrs, which is mentioned as the minimum.

10\. The retribution is that way well perfected when, in renunciation of
that sin which attacks, a proper efficacy is prepared *and* becomes a
vestige (vûnakŏ) of the sin of the performer. 11. Whoever is not able to
arrange it in this manner is to entreat the prayers of three men with a
donation of wealth, and is to solemnize his Nônâbar *ceremony* <span
id="fr_890"></span>[3](#fn_887), *or he* is to consecrate a sacred cake
every day in the ceremonial place, to eat food lawfully, *and* to order
the proper maintenance of the efficacy. 12. The assistance of performing
the proper rituals through ordering the Nâbar *ceremony*, and the
helping existence of discharging the burden of the trouble of a populous
household seem to me suitable for the atonement of such-like sin,
through the will of the sacred beings.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_869"></span>[233:1](sbe18086.htm#fr_872) The first word of
Yas. V, 1, 2 which forms the first portion (after the invocation) of the
inward prayer, or grace, to be muttered before eating or drinking. This
first portion may be translated as follows: 'Here then we praise
Ahura-mazda, who gave (or created) both cattle and righteousness, he
gave both water and good plants, he gave both the luminaries and the
earth, and everything good.' This is followed by three Ashem-vohûs, each
meaning as follows: 'Righteousness is the best good, a blessing it is; a
blessing be to that which is righteousness to *the angel of* perfect
rectitude.' After muttering these formulas, or 'taking' them inwardly as
a protective spell, the mutterer can eat or drink, and after washing his
mouth he 'speaks out' the spell or vâ*g* by reciting certain other
formulas aloud. This chapter refers to those who mutilate the vâ*g* by
muttering only its first word or words, which matter is also treated in
Sls. V.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[233:2](sbe18086.htm#fr_873) Supposing that
this word, which may be twice read mâânâê and four times mâânâê,
represents the Ar. ma’hni, but this is by no means certain.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[234:1](sbe18086.htm#fr_874) The initiatory
ceremony of a young priest, written nâîbar or nâgbar in this chapter,
and sometimes nônâbar (Pahl. navak nâîbar).

<span id="fn_872"></span>[234:2](sbe18086.htm#fr_875) This ceremony,
which means 'the world-purchased,' and by which, according to the
Sad-dar Bundahi*s*, 'heaven is purchased in the world, and one's own
place brought to hand in heaven,' lasts three days, and is performed by
two priests; the first day's ceremonies are those of the Nônâbar, those
of the second are of the angel Srôsh, and those of the third are of the
Sîrôzah, or angels of the thirty days of the month (see Bd. XXX, 28 n).

<span id="fn_873"></span>[234:3](sbe18086.htm#fr_876) Reading râî
instead of lâ, 'not'

<span id="fn_874"></span>[234:4](sbe18086.htm#fr_877) Reading va*r*kâ,
instead of va neked, 'female,' which is much like it in Pahl. letters.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[234:5](sbe18086.htm#fr_878) And is, therefore,
an initiated. priest.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[234:6](sbe18086.htm#fr_879) M14 has 'from
impotent suffering.'

<span id="fn_877"></span>[234:7](sbe18086.htm#fr_880) See Chap. XXX, I.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[235:1](sbe18086.htm#fr_881) Reading vâ*g*ŏ
atôfdâ*d*agân-î nadûgânŏ, which M14 has altered to mean 'and if in his
state of hunger and thirst.'

<span id="fn_879"></span>[235:2](sbe18086.htm#fr_882) Merely the first
words of the two formulas which constitute the inward prayer, or vâ*g*
(see § i n).

<span id="fn_880"></span>[235:3](sbe18086.htm#fr_883) M14 has only '*he*
is to eat.'

<span id="fn_881"></span>[235:4](sbe18086.htm#fr_884) M14 has 'and is
authorisedly to preserve his own body.'

<span id="fn_882"></span>[235:5](sbe18086.htm#fr_885) Reading f*r*âg, as
in M14 and § 2, instead of pavan, 'in;' though the reading 'in taking
up' is quite possible.

<span id="fn_883"></span>[235:6](sbe18086.htm#fr_886) The sin of
drâyân-*g*ûyi*s*nîh, 'eagerness for chattering,' which arises from
talking while eating, praying, or at any other time when a prayer
(vâ*g*) has been taken inwardly and is not yet spoken out. The sin
arises from breaking the spell of the inward prayer (see Sts. V).

<span id="fn_884"></span>[235:7](sbe18086.htm#fr_887) Comp. Av. parshuya
and Pers. pashang, bashang. This word has been misread ya*z*i*s*n,
'ceremony,' in Sls. V, 3, 4, which ought to stand as follows:--'It is
unseasonable chatter for every single drop; *for* him who has performed
the ritual *it* is a Tanâpûhar sin; *for* him who has not performed the
ritual *it* is less, <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> some *have* said
three Srôshô-*k*aranâms. The measure of unseasonable chatter is a
Tanâpûhar *sin*; this is where every single drop, or every single
morsel, or every single taste is not completed.'

<span id="fn_885"></span>[236:1](sbe18086.htm#fr_888) The stîr is
evidently taken here as equivalent to the Srôshô-*k*aranâm of Sls. V, 3
(see the last note). A sin of three Srôshô-*k*aranâms, 'lashes with a
scourge,' is called a Farmân, and is usually the least degree of sin of
which notice is taken; its amount is variously estimated (see Sls. IV,
14, X, 24, XI, 2, XVI, 1, 5), but the value given here, in the text, is
very likely correct, and is equivalent to about 4 1/5 rûpîs, either in
weight or amount (see Chap. LII, r n).

<span id="fn_886"></span>[236:2](sbe18086.htm#fr_889) The word Ithâ. M14
has 'every single time it is spoken in tasting with an efficacy like
that word,' but the meaning of this is not clear.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[236:3](sbe18086.htm#fr_890) See § 4.
