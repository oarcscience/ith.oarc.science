<p>1. <I>As to</I> the seventieth question and reply, that which you ask is thus; Is anything which happens</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_215"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215</FONT></A></p>  
<p>unto men through fate or through action, is exertion destiny <I>or</I> without destiny, <I>and</I> does anything devoid of destiny happen unto men, or what way is it? 2. <I>As to</I> that which they say, that, when a man turns unto sinfulness, they ordain anew a new death&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_796"></A><A HREF="#fn_793"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; <I>as to</I> that which they say, <I>that</I> anything which happens unto men is a work of the moon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_797"></A><A HREF="#fn_794"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and every benefit is connected with the moon, and the moon bestows <I>it</I> upon worldly beings; and <I>as to</I> what way the moon <I>does</I> this, and bestows all benefits, order <I>some one</I> to decide the literal explanation of how and what way it is, by the will of the sacred beings.</p>  
<p>3. The reply is this, that the high-priests&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_798"></A><A HREF="#fn_795"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> have said thus, that there are <I>some</I> things through destiny, and there are <I>some</I> through action; and <I>it</I> is thus fully decided by them, that life, wife, and child, authority and wealth are through destiny, and the righteousness and wickedness of priesthood, warfare, and husbandry are through action. 4. And this, too, is thus said by them, that that which is not</p>

<p>destined for a man in the world does not happen; <I>and</I> that which is destined, be it owing to exertion, will come forward, be it through sinfulness <I>or</I> slothfulness he is injured by it. 5. That which will come forward owing to exertion is such as <I>his</I> who goes to a meeting of happiness, or the sickness <I>of</I> a mortal who, owing to sickness, dies early&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_799"></A><A HREF="#fn_796"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; <I>and</I> he who through sinfulness and slothfulness is thereby injured is such as <I>he</I> who would wed no wife, <I>and</I> is certain that no child of his is born, <I>or</I> such as he who gives <I>his</I> body unto slaughter, and life is injured by his living.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_793"></A><A HREF="sbe18078.htm#fr_796">215:1</A> This reference is to a phrase in the Pahl. commentary on Vend. V, 33, which commentary contains a good many of the statements made in this chapter, excepting those relating to the moon. The reading a&ocirc;sh, 'death,' given by K35, is probably more correct than a&ucirc;ba<I>s</I>, 'for him,' given by our modern MSS. of the Vendid&acirc;<I>d</I>; but M14 has amended it, and states 'then many new things are ordained by it for him.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_794"></A><A HREF="sbe18078.htm#fr_797">215:2</A> Assuming that vidan&acirc;g, 'time,' stands for bidan&acirc;g, the Huz. of m&acirc;h, which means both 'month' and 'moon.' In the following phrases the word m&acirc;h is used.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_795"></A><A HREF="sbe18078.htm#fr_798">215:3</A> It may be noted that most Pahlavi writers, when quoting the Pahlavi commentaries on the Vendid&acirc;<I>d</I> (as the author is doing here) or any other Nask, speak of them merely as the utterances of the high-priests, and reserve the term d&icirc;n&ocirc;, 'revelation,' for the Avesta itself; thus showing that belief in the inspiration of the Pahlavi translations of the Avesta is a very modern idea.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_796"></A><A HREF="sbe18078.htm#fr_799">216:1</A> M14 has 'which comes forward owing to sickness.'</P>
