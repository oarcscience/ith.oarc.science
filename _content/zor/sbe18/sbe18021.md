### CHAPTER XIII.

1\. The twelfth question is that which you ask thus: In the fourth night
do they score off (ba*r*â angârênd) the sin by the good works, and does
he go by the residue (bôn); or do they inflict punishment on him for the
sin which *has* happened to him, and give reward *and* recompense for
the good works which he *has* done?

2\. The reply is this, that at dawn of the third night the account is
prepared it is said, and about the sin which he *has* atoned for, *and*
the good work which is its equivalent (â*v*âr) *there* is no need for
account, since the account is about the good works which may be
appropriated by him *as* his own, and about the sin which may remain
*in* him as *its* origin. 3. Because the origin of it (the sin atoned
for) remains distinct, and it is cancelled (astar*d*ŏ)

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

by it (the good work), they balance it therewith; and they weigh the
excess and deficiency, as it may be, of the *other* good works *and*
sin.

4\. Of those living, at the just, impartial (a*k*afsi*s*nŏ) balance the
*man* of proper habits (dâ*d*ŏ), whose good works are more, when sin
*has* happened to him, undergoes a temporary (vidanâîk) punishment and
becomes eternally cleansed by the good works; and he of improper habits,
of much sin and little good works, attains temporary enjoyment by those
good works, *but* through the sin which they perceive *in* him he is
suffering punishment unto the resurrection.
