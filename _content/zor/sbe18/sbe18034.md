### CHAPTER XXVII.

1\. The twenty-sixth question is that which you ask thus: How are the
nature of hell, *and* the pain, discomfort <span
id="fr_173"></span>[2](#fn_172), punishment, and stench of hell?

2\. The reply is this, that *it is* sunken, deep, and descending, most
dark, most stinking, and most terrible, most *supplied with* wretched
existences (anâzî*d*ântûm), and most bad, the place and cave

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (grêstakŏ) of the
demons and fiends. 3. And in it is no comfort, pleasantness, *or* joy
whatever; *but* in it are all stench, filth, pain, punishment, distress,
profound evil, and discomfort; and *there* is no resemblance of it
whatever *to* worldly stench, filthiness, pain, and evil. 4. And since
*there* is no resemblance of the mixed evil of the world to that which
is its sole-indicating (aê-numâî) good, *there* is also a deviation
(gumi*s*nŏ) of it from the origin and abode of evil <span
id="fr_174"></span>[1](#fn_173).

5\. And so much more grievous is the evil in hell than even the most
grievous evil on earth, as the greatness of the spiritual *existence* is
*more* than *that of* the world; and more grievous is the terror of the
punishment on the soul than that of the vileness of the demons on the
body. 6. And the punishment on the soul is from those whose abode *it
has* become <span id="fr_175"></span>[2](#fn_174), from the demons and
darkness--a likeness of that evil to hell--the head (kamârakŏ) of whom
is Aharman the deadly.

7\. And the words of the expressive utterance of the high-priests are
these, that where *there* is a fear of every other thing *it* is more
than the thing itself, *but* hell is a thing worse than the fear *of
it*.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[57:2](sbe18034.htm#fr_173) Or
'ingloriousness.'

<span id="fn_173"></span>[58:1](sbe18034.htm#fr_174) Meaning, probably,
that the mixture of good and evil in the world is as far removed from
heaven as it is from hell. But the words aê-numâî and gumi*s*nŏ are
doubtful both in reading and meaning.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[58:2](sbe18034.htm#fr_175) That is, hell has
become; reading man ga*s*tŏ.
