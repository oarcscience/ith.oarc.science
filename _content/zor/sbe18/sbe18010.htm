<p>1. First you ask thus: Why is a righteous man created better than the stars and moon <I>and</I> sun and fire of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, and is called in revelation greater and better than the spiritual creation, <I>and</I> also than that which is worldly?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that the greatness and goodness of advance in wisdom and just judgment over the creatures arise from proficiency (h&ucirc;nar). 3. Justice is the one good proficiency over the creatures, the means of wisdom are great, and praise bestowed is the most effectual performance</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of what is desirable (k&acirc;mi<I>s</I>n-kar&icirc;h). 4. For all three are mutually connected together; since the manifestation of justice is through wisdom, and its advantage is the performance of what is desirable for the creator; wisdom is the performance of what is desirable for the requirements of the creator, and its weapon (z&ecirc;n&ocirc;) is justice; and the desire of the creator, which is progress, is in wisdom with justice. 5. All three are great among the creatures, and their lodgment in the superior beings and righteous men is spiritual, in the spirit which is the pure guardian angel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <I>in</I> the understanding for encountering, averting, smiting, and prostrating (khv&acirc;p&acirc;k) the fiend, <I>in</I> the army of angels, and in the sovereignty of the far-seeing (d&ucirc;r-v&ecirc;n&acirc;ko)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> spirit, A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; and, materially, in the worldly equipment and mutual connection of body <I>and</I> life. 6. And their appliances are the wisdom and worldly efficacy of treatises on the wise adoption of good thoughts, good words, <I>and</I> good deeds, <I>and</I> the relinquishment <I>and</I> discontinuance of evil thoughts, evil words, <I>and</I> evil deeds. 7. And their acquirer is the worldly ruler who is providing for A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, and approving and stimulating the pure religion, a praiser of the good and pure creator, and a director of persistence in destruction of the fiend. 8. And in the promulgation</p>

<p>9. And <I>such rulers</I> are great and pre-eminent; yet every man is not for that greatness, but it is mentioned as to superior beings <I>and</I> concerning righteous men, in whom it <I>has</I> arisen, and the best are the three who are the beginning, middle, <I>and</I> end of the creation. 10. One is the pure man, G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>, who was its first rational praiser; he in whose keeping <I>was</I> the whole creation of the sacred beings, from <I>its</I> beginning and immaturity unto the final completion of the worldly creatures, over which <I>was</I> the exercise of goodness of his well-destined progeny, such as H&ocirc;sh&acirc;ng, T&acirc;khm&ocirc;rup, Yim, and Fr&ecirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, such as the apostles of the religion, like Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, H&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar, and H&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar-m&acirc;h&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and the producers of the renovation <I>of the universe</I>, like S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, R&ocirc;shan&ocirc;-<I>k</I>ashm, and</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_39"></A><A HREF="sbe18010.htm#fr_39">12:2</A> This word is badly written in K35, so that it has become z&ocirc;r&icirc;n&acirc;k in later MSS., which might perhaps mean 'strength--exerting.'</P>

The five names of these primeval sovereigns are corruptions of the Avesta names, Gaya-maretan, Haoshyangha, Takhm&ocirc;-urupa, Yima, and Thra&ecirc;taona. The third name is always written T&acirc;khm&ocirc;r&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335; in Dd.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_42"></A><A HREF="sbe18010.htm#fr_42">13:3</A> Corruptions of Av. Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, Ukhshya<I>d</I>-ereta, and Ukhshya<I>d</I>-nemangh. The last two are future apostles still expected by the Parsis to restore their religion to its original purity, in preparation for the resurrection (see Bd. XXXII, 2-10, Byt. III, 13, 43-48, 52, 53).</P>

XXX, 4-27, XXXII, 8, Byt. III, 62).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_44"></A><A HREF="sbe18010.htm#fr_44">14:1</A> These two names, which mean 'bright-eyed' and 'sunny-eyed,' are the Av. Rao<I>k</I>as-<I>k</I>a&ecirc;shman and Hvare-<I>k</I>a&ecirc;shman of Fravar<I>d</I>&icirc;n Yt. 128 (see also Chap. XXXVI, 4).</P>

They appear, originally, to have been both supposed to spring from A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, who speaks of 'the more beneficent of my two spirits' in Yas. XIX, 21; but in later times, and throughout the Pahlavi literature, the beneficent spirit is identified with A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, and the origin of the evil spirit is left in obscurity.</P>
