### CHAPTER XC.

1\. *As to* the eighty-ninth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: Who, and how many are they who are without the religion (adînôîh)
*but* are made immortal, and for what purpose is their immortality? 2.
Where is the place they, each one, possess sovereignty, and *in* the
place where they possess sovereignty are *there* people of the good
religion of every kind, or how are they; are *there* sacred fires <span
id="fr_959"></span>[2](#fn_956) and appointed worship, or how is

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

it; and for what purpose is each one of their sovereignties?

3\. The reply is this, that the immortal rulers of the region of glory,
Khvanîras <span id="fr_960"></span>[1](#fn_957), are said *to be* seven:
one is Yô*s*tô, son of Fryân  <span id="fr_961"></span>[2](#fn_958); the
Avesta name of one is Yakhmâyûs*ad* <span
id="fr_962"></span>[3](#fn_959), son of the same Fryân; the name of one
is Fradhakh*s*tŏ, son of the Khumbîks <span
id="fr_963"></span>[4](#fn_960); the name of one is Ashavazang, son of
Pôrûdakhstôîh <span id="fr_964"></span>[5](#fn_961); one is the tree
opposed to harm <span id="fr_965"></span>[6](#fn_962);

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

one is Gôpatshah <span id="fr_966"></span>[1](#fn_963); *and* one is
Peshyôtanû <span id="fr_967"></span>[2](#fn_964), who is called after
the *K*îtravôkŏ-mîyânŏ <span id="fr_968"></span>[3](#fn_965).

4\. The reign of Gôpatshah is over the land of Gôpatŏ <span
id="fr_969"></span>[4](#fn_966), coterminous with Aîrân-vê*g* <span
id="fr_970"></span>[5](#fn_967), on the bank (bar) of the water of the
Dâîtîh <span id="fr_971"></span>[6](#fn_968); *and* he keeps watch over
the ox Hadhayã*s* <span id="fr_972"></span>[7](#fn_969), through whom
occurs the complete perfection of primitive man <span
id="fr_973"></span>[8](#fn_970). 5. The reign of Peshyôtanû is in
Kangde*z* <span id="fr_974"></span>[9](#fn_971), *and* he resides in the
illustrious Kangde*z* which the noble Sîyâvash <span
id="fr_975"></span>[10](#fn_972) formed through his glory, *he* who is
called the erratic youth <span id="fr_976"></span>[11](#fn_973) of the
illustrious Kayânians. 6. And through his powerful spirit *arose*
increase of cultivation and the ruler Kaî-Khûsrôî <span
id="fr_977"></span>[12](#fn_974) among the highest of the mountains in
the countries of

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Irân *and* Tûrân;
the purity of the sacred fire <span id="fr_978"></span>[1](#fn_975) of
great glory *and* the recital of the liturgy exist there, *and* the
practice of religious rites (dînô) is provided. 7. The custom, also, of
him (Peshyôtanû) and *his* companions *and* coadjutors (ham-bâr), in the
appointed millenniums, is the great advancement of religion and good
works in other quarters likewise <span id="fr_979"></span>[2](#fn_976).

8\. But, secondly, *as to* the whereabouts of the places which are
theirs--just like his--of which *there* is no disquisition by me, this
also is even owing to *my* not remembering <span
id="fr_980"></span>[3](#fn_977).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_956"></span>[255:2](sbe18097.htm#fr_959) Literally 'fires
of Varahrân' (see Chap. XXXI, 7).

<span id="fn_957"></span>[256:1](sbe18097.htm#fr_960) The central one of
the seven regions of the earth, which is supposed to contain all the
countries best known to the Iranians, and to be as large as the other
six regions put together (see Bd. XI, 2-6). The name is here corrupted
into Khvanâîra*s*.

<span id="fn_958"></span>[256:2](sbe18097.htm#fr_961) Av. Yôi*s*tô yô
Fryananãm of Âbân Yt. 81, Fravar*d*în Yt. 120, who had to explain
ninety-nine enigmas propounded to him by the evil Akhtya. In Pâz. this
name is corrupted into Gô*s*t-î Fryânô, whose explanation of
thirty-three enigmas propounded by Akht the wizard, and proposal of
three enigmas in his turn form the subject of a Pahlavi tale published
with AV. He is not included among the immortals mentioned in Bd. XXIX,
5, 6, and Dk. (see § 8, note), but is one of those specified in Byt. II,
1.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[256:3](sbe18097.htm#fr_962) No doubt, the Av.
Ashem-yahmâi-u*s*ta ('righteousness for which be blessing') who precedes
Yôi*s*tô in Fravar*d*în Yt. 120. He is the Asâm-î Yamâhu*s*t of Bd.
XXIX, 5, who is said to reside in the district of the river Nâîvtâk; but
he is not mentioned in Dk. The names Yakhmâyûs*ad*, Fradhakh*s*tŏ, and
Ashavazang are written in Pâzand, which accounts for their irregular
spelling.

<span id="fn_960"></span>[256:4](sbe18097.htm#fr_963) Av. Fradhâkh*s*ti
Khu*n*bya of Fravar*d*în Yt. 138. In Dk. he is said to be ruler on the
Nâîvtâk waters, but in Bd. he is called Par*s*adgâ *Hv*embya residing in
the plain of Pê*s*yânsaî.

<span id="fn_961"></span>[256:5](sbe18097.htm#fr_964) Av. Ashavazdang

Ashavazd son of Pourudhâkh*s*t in Bd., and is said to rule in the plain
of Pê*s*yânsaî in Dk.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[256:6](sbe18097.htm#fr_965) The many-seeded
tree, said to grow in the wide-formed ocean, and also in Aîrân-vê*g*, on
which the Saêna bird (simurgh) is sup-posed to sit and shake off the
seeds, which are then conveyed by the bird *K*amrô*s* to the waters
gathered by Tî*s*tar, who rains them down on the earth with the water;
hence the growth of fresh vegetation when the rainy season commences
(see Rashnu Yt. 17, Bd. XXXVI, 2, XXIX, 5, Mkh. LXII, 37-42).

<span id="fn_963"></span>[257:1](sbe18097.htm#fr_966) Either a title or
son of Aghrêra*d*, brother of Frâsîyâ*v* of Tûr (see Bd. XXIX, 5, XXXI,
20-22). He is a righteous minotaur according to Mkh. LXII, 31-36.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[257:2](sbe18097.htm#fr_967) Here written
Patshâyôtanû, but he is the Peshyôtanû of Chap. XXXVII, 36.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[257:3](sbe18097.htm#fr_968) The *K*atru-mîyân
river in Kangde*z* (see Bd. XX, 31).

<span id="fn_966"></span>[257:4](sbe18097.htm#fr_969) Which is a
non-Aryan country according to Dk., but Bd. (XXIX, 5) calls it 'the land
of the S*a*ukavastân,' and Mkh. (XLIV, 24-35, LXII, 31) places Gôpatshah
in Aîrân-vê*g*.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[257:5](sbe18097.htm#fr_970) See Chap. XXI, 2.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[257:6](sbe18097.htm#fr_971) Av. Dâitya, a
river which flows out of Aîrân-vê*g* (see Bd. XX, 13).

<span id="fn_969"></span>[257:7](sbe18097.htm#fr_972) See Chap. XXXVII,
99.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[257:8](sbe18097.htm#fr_973) Referring either
to the complete peopling of the earth by emigration on the back of this
ox in ancient times, or to the immortality produced at the resurrection
by tasting an elixir, of which the fat of this ox is one of the
ingredients.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[257:9](sbe18097.htm#fr_974) A settlement east
of Persia formed, or fortified, by Sîyâvash (see Bd. XXIX, 10, Byt. III,
25).

<span id="fn_972"></span>[257:10](sbe18097.htm#fr_975) See Chap. XXXVII,
36.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[257:11](sbe18097.htm#fr_976) Or kang-î raftâr
may mean 'jaunty youth;' but it is evidently an attempt to account for
the name Kangde*z* as 'the fortress of the kang ("youth").'

<span id="fn_974"></span>[257:12](sbe18097.htm#fr_977) The son of
Sîyâvash (see Chap. XXXVI, 3, Bd. XXXI, 25).

<span id="fn_975"></span>[258:1](sbe18097.htm#fr_978) Literally 'fire of
Varahrân.'

<span id="fn_976"></span>[258:2](sbe18097.htm#fr_979) He is expected to
be summoned by the angels to restore the religious rites to the world,
after the conflict of the nations in a future age (see Byt. III, 25-42).

<span id="fn_977"></span>[258:3](sbe18097.htm#fr_980) In the detailed
account of the contents of the Sû*d*kar (or Stû*d*gar) Nask, given in
the ninth book of the Dînka*rd*, the latter part of its fifteenth
fargar*d* is said to have been 'on the seven immortal rulers who are
produced in the region of Khvanîras, and also about the determination of
their glory, and the goodness, too, of *their* assistants and living
sovereignty in both worlds. The tree opposed to harm is on Aîrân-vê*g*
in the place of most excavations (frêh-nigânân?). Gôk-patŏ is in the
non-Aryan countries. Peshyôtanû son of Vi*s*tâsp is in Kangde*z* of the
hundred-ribbed shape (sa*d*-dandakŏ kerpîh?), in which a myriad of the
exalted, who wear black marten *fur* (mûn sîyah samûr yakhsenund), are
righteous listeners out of the retinue of Peshyôtanû son of Vi*s*tâsp.
Frâ*d*akh*s*tŏ son of the mortal Khûmbîks, who is sovereign on the water
of Nâîvtâk. Ashavazd son of Pôrû*d*akh*s*tŏ, who is sovereign over the
most manifest among uplands, the plain, of Pê*s*inâs. Barâzd the causer
of strife. And of the father-in-law's race (kha*s*t-tômagag?) of the
famous Vi*s*tâsp is *he* who is called Kaî-Khûsrôî, who produces even an
advance of thy religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, and also understands
about *it; and* who gives my good practices further blessings, so that
the world maintains my doings with benedictions. Perfect is the
excellence of righteousness.'

In this list of the immortal rulers of ancient times, the names of
Barâzd and Kaî-Khûsrôî are substituted for those of Yô*s*tô and <span
id="page_259">p. 259</span> Yakhmâyûs*ad* in our text. Barâzd is the
Ibairaz of Bd. XXIX, 6, and, possibly, the Av. Berezyar*s*ti of
Fravar*d*în Yt. 101.
