### CHAPTER X.

1\. The ninth question is that which you ask thus: How much does the
growth <span id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_80) of his good works increase,
from the time when the good works are done, so long as *he* is living?

2\. The reply is this, that from the *time* when a good work comes into
progress *its* growth remains on the increase so long as *he* is living;
moreover,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

when he is distressed by that good work <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_81), while the increase does not desist *from*
increase, it grows just as a child becomes enlarged in the womb of a
mother.
