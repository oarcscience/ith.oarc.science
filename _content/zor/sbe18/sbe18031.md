### CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. The twenty-third question is that which you ask thus: When he who is
righteous passes away, where is the place the soul sits the first night,
the second, and the third; and what does it do?

2\. The reply is this, that thus it is said, that the

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

soul of man, itself the spirit of the body <span
id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_159), after passing away, is three nights
upon earth, doubtful about its own position (gâs) <span
id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_160), and in fear of the account; and it
experiences terror, distress (dahyakŏ), and fear through anxiety about
the *K*inva*d* bridge <span id="fr_162"></span>[3](#fn_161); and as it
sits it notices about its own good works *and* sin. 3. And the soul,
which in a manner *belongs* to *that* same spirit of the body which is
alike experiencing and alike touching it, becomes acquainted by sight
with the sin which it *has* committed, and the good works which it *has*
scantily done.

4\. And the first night from its own good thoughts, the second night
from *its* good words, and the third night from *its* good deeds it
obtains pleasure for the soul; and if also, with the righteousness,
there be sin which remains *in it* as its origin, the first punishment
in retribution for the evil deed occurs *that* same third night. 5. The
same third night, on the fresh arrival of a dawn <span
id="fr_163"></span>[4](#fn_162), the treasurer of good works, like a
handsome maiden (kanîkŏ) <span id="fr_164"></span>[5](#fn_163), comes
out to meet *it* with the store of its own good works; and, collected by
witches (parîkŏ-*k*ind), the sin and crime unatoned for (atôkhtŏ) come
on to the account *and* are justly accounted for <span
id="fr_165"></span>[6](#fn_164).

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

6\. For the remaining (ketrûn*d*) sin it undergoes punishment *at* the
bridge, and the evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds are atoned
for; and with the. good thoughts, good words, and good deeds of its own
commendable and pleasing spirit it steps for-ward unto the supreme
heaven (garô*d*mânô) <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_165), or to heaven
(vahi*s*tô), or to the ever-stationary (hamîstânagânŏ) of the
righteous <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_166), there where there is a
place for it in righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_159"></span>[54:1](sbe18031.htm#fr_160) The 'spirit of the
body' which is to some extent distinguished from the 'soul,' both in
this chapter and the next, is probably the life, as described in Chap.
XXIII, 7.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[54:2](sbe18031.htm#fr_161) That is, its future
position, or 'destination.'

<span id="fn_161"></span>[54:3](sbe18031.htm#fr_162) See Chap. XXI, 2-7

<span id="fn_162"></span>[54:4](sbe18031.htm#fr_163) Reading dên bâm-i
nuk ayâftŏ.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[54:5](sbe18031.htm#fr_164) Fully described in
Hn. II, 22-32, AV. IV, 18-35, Mkh. II, 125-139

<span id="fn_164"></span>[54:6](sbe18031.htm#fr_165) The author is more
practical than most other writers on the same subject, as he assumes
that the righteous soul is not absolutely righteous, nor the wicked soul
absolutely wicked.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[55:1](sbe18031.htm#fr_166) See Chap. XX, 3.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[55:2](sbe18031.htm#fr_167) There is another
place for the ever-stationary of the wicked (see Chap. XXXIII, 2).
