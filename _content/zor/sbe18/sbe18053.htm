<p><A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that there is no loss of reputation to priests from priestly duties (a&ecirc;rpat&icirc;h), which are themselves the acquired knowledge <I>that</I> is accumulated <I>by</I> the priestly disposition, care for the soul, <I>and</I> the requisite good works. 3. <I>And</I> there is this advantage, that, through acquaintance with the religion <I>of</I> the sacred beings, <I>and</I> certainty as to the reward of the spirit, they make <I>them</I> become more contented in adversity, more intelligent as regards stability of character in difficulty <I>and</I> restriction, and more through knowledge the abode of hope for those saved. 4.

When even by that they do not obtain <I>it, they</I> are to seek a livelihood by agriculture, sheep-rearing, penmanship, <I>or</I> other proper employment among priests; <I>and</I> when <I>it</I> is not possible for them to live even by these, <I>they are to seek it</I> by bearing arms, hunting, <I>or</I> other proper employment in the profession of a virtuous warrior. 7.
