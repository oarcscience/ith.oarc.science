And on account of your embarrassment and wrong-<I>doing</I> (va<I>d</I>ag) they would give up the Frasn&acirc;t<I>e</I>&ecirc; ('washing upwards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1306"></A><A HREF="#fn_1301"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) and Upasn&acirc;t<I>e</I>&ecirc; ('washing downwards'), to bring the fifteen <I>times</I> which are without ordinance (ba<I>r</I>&acirc; &acirc;&icirc;nak&#335;), that are after it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1307"></A><A HREF="#fn_1302"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, back to the fifteen which are a portion of the ordinance (&acirc;&icirc;nak&#335; v&acirc;&icirc;).</p>

<p>allotted unto the priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1311"></A><A HREF="#fn_1306"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for if <I>he were</I> impure (pali<I>s</I>t&#335;) there <I>would</I> be no one whatever who would properly perform the purification as it is necessary.</p>  
<p>5. Then it <I>has</I> become indispensable <I>for</I> you to perform the purification, for that operation--so suitable for the discreet where 'he who <I>has been</I> by the dead&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1312"></A><A HREF="#fn_1307"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,' so that he has become polluted, and even 'the stars and moon and sun shine upon his life discontentedly'--is just as fit for the exalted when there is great 'propitiation of fire, water, earth, cattle, righteous males, and righteous women' thereby. 6. So great is <I>its</I> value <I>that</I> where there is no purification <I>of</I> the body <I>it</I> is not possible to purify the life <I>and</I> soul; <I>and</I> when there is a man in a realm who is able to perform it, that man is not justifiable except when he shall perform <I>it</I>.</p>  
<p>7. Finally, when that pre-eminent operation is <I>being</I> accomplished, over which <I>there</I> is in revelation and the perfect information due to revelation that supreme&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1313"></A><A HREF="#fn_1308"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> control which you are so disputing in the religion--which even through your trifling (kh&ucirc;r<I>d</I>ak&#335;) in the name of authority is becoming a struggle (patk&acirc;r-yehev&ucirc;n)--then, though it may not be possible for you to perform <I>it</I> yourself, it should thereupon be the duty of some one of your <I>disciples</I> to perform it in your sight, so that you <I>may</I> be aware of the rite, even apart from the great resources in <I>that</I> most learned (&acirc;<I>z</I>t&ucirc;m) acquaintance</p>  
<p>

<p>with revelation which is associated with you&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1314"></A><A HREF="#fn_1309"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 8. Also from that which is repeatedly written by you with understanding of the rite, as regards all three teachings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1315"></A><A HREF="#fn_1310"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>it</I> is manifest those rites are mentioned even <I>as</I> those <I>which</I> are more maintained, <I>and</I> are not those which are unnecessary to perform. 9. You are a something therein that <I>tends</I> to preserve&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1316"></A><A HREF="#fn_1311"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> a little <I>of</I> what it is not possible for thee to attain fully in any mode; when thou shalt obtain the operations of the voice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1317"></A><A HREF="#fn_1312"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and the water and bull's urine, as well as the three men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1318"></A><A HREF="#fn_1313"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, or thou shalt give a man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1319"></A><A HREF="#fn_1314"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> to wash therein, the intellect of those controlling is then, indeed, not preservative therein.</p>  
<p>10. It is proper also for you to consecrate the water <I>and</I> bull's urine by that ritual which is in all three teachings, to prepare your own ritualistic liquid <I>and</I> other <I>things</I> which are approved among you with mutual assistance, <I>and</I> to appoint a purifier who <I>has</I> performed fully acceptably <I>and</I> been wanted. 11. Then, to give <I>out</I> properly to the country that the purification, is according to my order, I always</p>

<p><A NAME="page_340"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 340</FONT></A></p>  
<p>perform <I>it</I> more acceptably than that of other purifiers. 12. For the water <I>and</I> bull's urine are all consecrated by me, and the three hundred pebbles (sang&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1320"></A><A HREF="#fn_1315"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) are cast into them (a&ucirc;ba<I>s</I>) by me, just as it is directed; the operation is also directed by me in the three days&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1321"></A><A HREF="#fn_1316"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> when it is performed, and all the customary <I>parts</I> are washed three times by me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1322"></A><A HREF="#fn_1317"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; the ablution seats (mak&#335;) are also arranged by me anew for every single person, and the use of washed seats is not ordered by me therein&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1323"></A><A HREF="#fn_1318"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; every rite of the washing by the purifier is also so performed by me as all three teachings have mentioned as perfection. 13. You become the best of the district, as regards the minutiae (b&acirc;r&icirc;k&icirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;&acirc;n) of the purification that is within your duty, so long as they excite the sight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1324"></A><A HREF="#fn_1319"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, <I>but</I> which are curtailed (kazd) by you in the way of washing disclosed to me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1325"></A><A HREF="#fn_1320"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, while, when it should be performed by you in this manner, your performance would be equally constantly extolled <I>and</I> your writing praised.</p>  
<p>14. When, then, you write of it that they should always perform it just as now, the falsity therein is</p>

<p>grievous (yagar), and I know none worse; for this washing and professional purification which <I>one</I> is to keep in operation--as is declared by revelation, the teaching of high-priests, and those of the primitive faith who are esteemable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1326"></A><A HREF="#fn_1321"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--you withdraw (madam d&acirc;r&ecirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) from the midst <I>of us</I>. 15. That <I>which</I> you understand yourself is that unto A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> the confederate good creatures are as <I>it were</I> defiled <I>and</I> in the eyes of the good <I>and</I> wise <I>they are</I> as <I>it were</I> propitiatory towards the mischievous V&acirc;&ecirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1327"></A><A HREF="#fn_1322"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 16. And your words about it are just as they say concerning a beggar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1328"></A><A HREF="#fn_1323"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, where a garment is given to him, thus: 'Wash the dirt (&acirc;l&ucirc;g) on him thoroughly clean;' <I>and</I> that garment they shall take is put upon the fire <I>and</I> burnt; and he spoke thus: 'My dirt <I>was</I> a comfort.'</p>

II, 10) are expected to bring, so as to restore the religion in preparation for the resurrection.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1300"></A><A HREF="sbe18115.htm#fr_1305">336:5</A> Those of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h, Afarg, and S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns (see Ep. I, v, 1, 6).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1301"></A><A HREF="sbe18115.htm#fr_1306">337:1</A> These terms are quoted from Vend. VIII, 276, 279 (see App. V), and are thus explained in Pahlavi in Chap. IV, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1302"></A><A HREF="sbe18115.htm#fr_1307">337:2</A> Referring, apparently, to the second mention' of the fifteen washings, in Pahl. Vend. VIII, 281, which does not occur in the Avesta text ('the ordinance'), but refers to its previous occurrence in &sect; 279 of the Avesta. But, perhaps, the author means that they would confound the final washing appointed in Vend. VIII, 299 with the preliminary washing appointed in the previous &sect; 279.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1303"></A><A HREF="sbe18115.htm#fr_1308">337:3</A> See Vend. VIII, 280, 287, 295 (compare App. V and Ep. I, ii, 6, note).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1304"></A><A HREF="sbe18115.htm#fr_1309">337:4</A> After the polluted person has thrice run a mile, he is to run further (see Vend. VIII, 294) to some inhabited spot; from which directions the author concludes that any excess of distance is immaterial. K35 and BK have 'four miles and more,' but this seems to be a copyist's blunder.</P>
