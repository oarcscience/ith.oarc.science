<p>1. <I>As to</I> the forty-first question and reply, that which you ask is thus: <I>As to</I> him who remains in the good religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers, <I>whom</I> men shall make the protection and assistance of the good religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_519"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, <I>who</I> shall save men from a foreign faith and irreligion (akd&icirc;n&ocirc;&icirc;h), and then holds back <I>some</I> of those who have the idea that they should go over to a foreign faith and irreligion, <I>and</I> they do not go over to the foreign faith, <I>but</I> become steadfast in the religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers, what is then&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_520"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> the</p>

<p>nature of the decision of the angels <I>about</I> him, and what is the nature of their (the men's) good works <I>and</I> sin?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that <I>he</I> is much extolled, happy, exalted, of great good works <I>and</I> abundant recompense, and the path to the best existence, prepared (fr&acirc;r&acirc;st&#335;) by his righteousness, is wide&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_519"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; the delight of <I>his</I> soul becomes complete, <I>and its</I> hope&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_520"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is great. 3. And every good work that is manifested in the good religion by those who are transferred by him from a foreign faith and irreligion, and <I>which</I> they shall do thereafter--when, through the perseverance <I>and</I> praise exercised by him who is protected by the religion, they are saved <I>from</I> irreligion--becomes his as much as though it had been set going by him himself, and <I>he has</I> the same praise and the same good works with them. 4. Of the extent (s&acirc;m&acirc;n&#335;) <I>and</I> amount of such good works <I>there</I> is no writing a second time, unless <I>his</I> acquaintance with the full computation of the good works due to <I>their</I> number is continuous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; but when <I>in</I> the same way they are practising and steadfast in sin it shall not be assigned <I>to him</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 5.

<p>righteousness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is very grand, and in the world he has himself great eminence, applause, <I>and</I> dignity.</p>  
<p>6. And as much as that which is an improper law <I>and</I> a law worthy of death is a punishing of the soul, and the disconnected&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_524"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> words and perversion (va<I>s</I>tak&icirc;h), due also to the perfidy (rangi<I>s</I>n&#335;) of the fiend <I>who has</I> come, are such that in his time the religious rites (d&icirc;n&ocirc;) performed are rites of grievous vexation <I>and</I> fear, <I>so</I> that which is a proper law, like the great glorification in spirit and the connected words of the high-priests, is the arrival of the good spirit as much as a virtue worthy of recompense <I>and</I> full of hope. 7. Even as that which is said thus: 'Of men who are practisers of good deeds the manifestation is then in their children.'</p>
