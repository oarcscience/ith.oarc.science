<p>1. <I>As to</I> the ninetieth question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: From what is the sky made, <I>and</I> with what is it prepared?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that the sky is a dome (gard&ucirc;n), wide <I>and</I> lofty; its inside and whole width and boundaries (&acirc;khyak&icirc;h&acirc;), besides its material existence, are the stone of light, of all stones the hardest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_981"></A><A HREF="#fn_978"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <I>and</I> most beautiful; and the grandeur of its spirit <I>and</I> even <I>its</I> internal bow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_982"></A><A HREF="#fn_979"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are like <I>those of</I> mighty warriors arrayed. 3. And that material of the sky reached unto the place <I>where</I> promise-breaking words exist&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_983"></A><A HREF="#fn_980"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> was without need of preparation; <I>as</I> it is said <I>of</I> places such as those--where wisdom is a witness about <I>them</I>--that <I>that</I> which is not even itself a place, and its place does not yet exist, is without need of any preparing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_984"></A><A HREF="#fn_981"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>kinds, <I>that</I> causing motion <I>and that</I> of movables&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_985"></A><A HREF="#fn_982"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; as mobility is mentioned about thought&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_986"></A><A HREF="#fn_983"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and immobility about material things. 5. Immovables are not moved, while movables are moved by their power of movement; and those movables, that way causing motion, are afterwards themselves a moving secret cause of motion, and then a cause of motion is not moving the movable, since <I>it</I> is not incapable of causing motion secretly by movement of itself. 6. Just as the force (k&ucirc;ni<I>s</I>n&#335;) of a movement exists <I>and</I> does not become a force; only then it is declared by wisdom, that the causers of motion have been the causing of motion by force before movement, <I>and, being</I> unmoved, they are subsequently made to move by the force; later on, the causers of motion <I>have</I> to cause motion, by their power of causing motion, <I>in</I> the non-causers of motion, from which it is certain though the force of a movement exists it does not become a force; but, finally, that <I>which is</I> prepared with a source of activity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_987"></A><A HREF="#fn_984"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, before force, becomes unmoved.</p>  
<p>7. Natures without need of the trouble of a preparer are distinguished from such; where movement occurs through every force, the championship of a position (g&acirc;h) not made to move--except, indeed, <I>of that</I> whose force, when it is unmoved by other force, is its own--is unmoving and thirstless&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_988"></A><A HREF="#fn_985"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 8. <I>It</I>&nbsp;</p>

<p><I>was</I> restored immovably when <I>there was</I> an approach to the sky of that actual contender for the place, the fiend, and the sky <I>was</I> shaken by him; for connected with the sky <I>were</I> arranged so many possessors of all resources, dignified (afrank&icirc;<I>d</I>) by their. own all-powerful position and that well-operating, mighty, undrawn bow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_989"></A><A HREF="#fn_986"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, righteous <I>and</I> well-discoursing (h&ucirc;fravakhsh), and many good spirits, gloriously co-operating for the preparation of the sky. 9. For that which <I>was</I> not even itself a place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_990"></A><A HREF="#fn_987"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, when <I>it</I> is thus henceforth really a place, is <I>in</I> want of preparing; <I>and</I>, in the preparation <I>of</I> that visible&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_991"></A><A HREF="#fn_988"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> place, with the material of the sky is mingled that triumphing, powerful spirit who made its existence a seeking for principle <I>and</I> seeking for intention, drawing up from below <I>and</I> drawing down from above, so that through that seeking for principle it becomes a concord, the resting-place of united champions, and unadmonishable through that power of seeking for intention; such as this <I>it is</I> if, indeed, <I>it be</I> the will of him, the creator of all goodness.</p>  
<p>10. And it is said summarily that the sky was shaken in the <I>period of</I> disturbance and restored <I>with</I> trouble; and, if the guardian spirits are in freedom from disturbance through the glory <I>of</I> the creator, when there is not even a place for it prepared by themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_992"></A><A HREF="#fn_989"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and <I>their</I> nature and own</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_978"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_981">259:1</A> The same notion as that indicated in Genesis by the word 'firmament.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_979"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_982">259:2</A> The rainbow.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_980"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_983">259:3</A> Probably meaning that the sky extends downwards, below the horizon, as far as the second grade of hell, that for 'evil words,' Du<I>s</I>-h&ucirc;kht (see Sls. VI, 3, note).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_981"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_984">259:4</A> The word d&icirc;v&acirc;k, 'place' (z&icirc;v&acirc;k in the Sasanian inscription of Naq<I>s</I>-i Rustam, but traditionally pronounced <I>g</I>&icirc;n&acirc;k), seems to be here taken in the etymological sense of z&icirc;v&acirc;k, that is, 'a living-place.' The text refers to the period, in the beginning, when the sky was indefinite space unprepared for the residence of creatures and merely a region of light (see Bd. I, 2), the light mentioned in &sect; 4. Its preparation is referred to in &sect;&sect; 8, 9.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_982"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_985">260:1</A> M14 has 'movables <I>and</I> immovables' instead of this clause.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_983"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_986">260:2</A> Perhaps we should read 'the spirits,' by inserting an additional medial stroke in the Pahlavi word.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_984"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_987">260:3</A> Reading t&ucirc;khsh&icirc;n&icirc;k&icirc;h&acirc;, instead of the unintelligible t&ucirc;khsht&icirc;k&icirc;h&acirc;'. The author has so nearly lost sight of his argument in the mazes of his verbiage that there is some uncertainty about the translation of this paragraph.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_985"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_988">260:4</A> That is, the guardians of a place exposed to all attacks (as <A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A> the sky is supposed to be), unless it is a stronghold in itself, must be always on the alert.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_986"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_989">261:1</A> The rainbow; reading atan<I>g</I> dar&ucirc;n.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_987"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_990">261:2</A> That is, 'a living-place' (see &sect; 3 n).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_988"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_991">261:3</A> Reading d&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;, 'seen;' but it may be st&ocirc; for st&icirc;, 'material.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_989"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_992">261:4</A> That is, while the sky was still indefinite space, the region of light, but, no dwelling-place; although the guardian spirits had <A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A> been created as representatives of the creatures, both spiritual and material, which were to be afterwards produced (see Bd. I, 8).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_990"></A><A HREF="sbe18098.htm#fr_993">262:1</A> That is, when afterwards prepared as a dwelling-place the sky remains unmoved by evil beings.</P>
