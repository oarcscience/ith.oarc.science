### CHAPTER VI.

1\. When at *any* time I write more pleasantly, this directs *you* to
understand that still with the steadfast, are my affection and natural
lowly-mindedness; afterwards, too, that which *happens* when you have
kept me wide away from the way of brotherhood, and higher even than a
father, master, leader, ruler, *or* high-priest, is due to the fame and
happiness of

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

my body *and* life, not *to* affection of character, but the position of
religion *and* the command of the sacred beings. 2. On that account,
when you have seen the pure religiousness, the learned knowledge, *and*
the repose-promoting truth of the invisible (avênâpîh) *of* which
my <span id="fr_1357"></span>[1](#fn_1352) heart is leaping with
evidence, so that you are steadfast even unto the nôi*d* asta-*k*a ('not
though the body') *of* which Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân spoke <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[2](#fn_1353)--and, because, turned by me to the
religion which is thy passport (parvânakŏ) to the best existence, you
have understood *that* it is the organizer of the greatest protection,
*even* that is supposed by me--I undergo all the terror of the period in
hope of the supreme recompense.

3\. And the position that that religion *has* given, which on that
account is mine, you have that way considered as supremacy <span
id="fr_1359"></span>[3](#fn_1354); and if, sent from you or another
person, the opposition of *one of* the same religion is seen *to be* the
dispersion and disruption of the appointed profession, I act against the
continuance of the opposition, and as steadfastly as the series (zarah)
of submissiveness and gratification of *your* priestly lordship *has*
done to me. 4. And this *will* be undoubtedly realised by you, that if
you do not turn away from this decree which is not preservative, but,
*being* appointed, I reach out from

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

the country of Irân <span id="fr_1360"></span>[1](#fn_1355), then I
*shall* become its greatest attacker of you. 5. And so I consider that
from my opposition it is possible *for* more harm to happen unto you
than from many accusers who are like the leader of those of the good
religion, the many who are as *it were* of like fame with me.

6\. And also from my departure, and the non-existence *of one* that is a
friend of yours, who, like me, is less able to be for your harm than he
who is *one* of the many accusers of whom it is I who am the restrainer,
you know this, that my coming is on account of the affection of some and
the reverence of others. 7. From the exercise of religion I do not at
all fall *away*, and for the sake of the position of the religion I am
maintaining opposition <span id="fr_1361"></span>[2](#fn_1356) to any
one; even when he is a friend *who* is loved by me, I am then his
antagonist 8. Fate (zîkŏ) <span id="fr_1362"></span>[3](#fn_1357) is the
great truth of the vacant, the form (andâm) <span
id="fr_1363"></span>[4](#fn_1358) which *has* procured the light of
life.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1352"></span>[349:1](sbe18118.htm#fr_1357) The MS. J ends
at this point, but the continuation of the text, as far as the word
'important' in Chap. IX, 7, is interpolated in Dd. XXXVII, 33 in the
same MS.

<span id="fn_1353"></span>[349:2](sbe18118.htm#fr_1358) In Vend. XIX,
26, 'not though the body, not though the life, not though the
consciousness should part asunder,' would he curse the good,
Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion.

<span id="fn_1354"></span>[349:3](sbe18118.htm#fr_1359) He now proceeds
from persuasion to an assertion of his authority, accompanied by
threats.

<span id="fn_1355"></span>[350:1](sbe18118.htm#fr_1360) Referring to his
intended visit to Sîrkân (see Chaps. V, 5, VII, 3, Ep. I, xi, 4),

<span id="fn_1356"></span>[350:2](sbe18118.htm#fr_1361) J has 'I am an
opposition.'

<span id="fn_1357"></span>[350:3](sbe18118.htm#fr_1362) Or 'living.'

<span id="fn_1358"></span>[350:4](sbe18118.htm#fr_1363) Or 'the time
(hangâm).'
