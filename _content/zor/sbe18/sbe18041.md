### CHAPTER XXXIV.

1\. *As to* the thirty-third question and reply, that which you ask is
thus: In what manner is there one way of the righteous from the Dâîtih
peak <span id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_248) to heaven, and one of the
wicked to hell; and *what is* their nature?

2\. The reply is this, that one is for ascent, and one for descent; and
on account of both being of one appearance I write thus much for
understanding and full explanation, that is to say:--3. The righteous
souls pass over on the *K*inva*d* bridge <span
id="fr_250"></span>[2](#fn_249) by spiritual flight and the power of
good works; and they step forth up to the star, or to the moon, or to
the sun station, or to the endless light <span
id="fr_251"></span>[3](#fn_250). 4. The soul of the wicked, owing to
*its* falling *from* the bridge, its lying demon, and the pollution
collected by its sin, they shall lead therefrom to the descent into the
earth, as both ways *lead* from that bridge on the Dâîtih peak.
