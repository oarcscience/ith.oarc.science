### CHAPTER XI.

1\. For completion little is observed by me; and a man of my own, *in* a
position of authority (sông gâh), comes with a second epistle <span
id="fr_1243"></span>[3](#fn_1239) for that priestly man, opposing,
disputing, showing the harm, making

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

aware of the deliverance <span id="fr_1244"></span>[1](#fn_1240), and
applying for arrangement. 2. And the man who comes as a co-operator is
announced by me, *and* the rite which is accomplished by him is *so*
till further *notice*, which is for my further epistle <span
id="fr_1245"></span>[2](#fn_1241); because a double elucidation about
that which it is necessary to arrange from afar is a custom more
suitable for the discreet.

3\. If *that* same priestly *man* <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[3](#fn_1242) should have been in the vicinity, then
interviews *with* me, with a few words, *would have been* more
preservative than *trying* to convert that wretchedness (vakhâr) into
that which is customary (pî*s*akŏ) even by further writing and much
information. 4. And even now my prospect is a well-considering demand
for explanation, so that, if the duties which are suitable for the
discreet *be* really disposable for it, it is proper so to arrange what
it is possible for me to complete *for* three months; *and* I *may* go
myself into the presence of *that* same priestly *man* for the
arrangement of the indispensable duties, and *may* diffuse this
arrangement properly <span id="fr_1247"></span>[4](#fn_1243). 5. *But*
there are many reasons for private reflection (nâhî*d*ŏ) on account of
which a descent from position is an evil resource; and *this* once a
temporary epistle is written by me to him, and comes with this
epistle <span id="fr_1248"></span>[5](#fn_1244). 6. And

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Ya*zd*ân-pânak <span id="fr_1249"></span>[1](#fn_1245), a man who is
instructed <span id="fr_1250"></span>[2](#fn_1246), shall come to him,
*who* is friendly to custom (âînag-îyâr), *and* of like rank with his
own man who is faithful; *and* I *will* write further *and* more
controversially to him, and give the information advisedly with which I
*shall* acquaint him, so that *it may be* more explanatory to him.

7\. But if through this which is written by me, or *through*
myself <span id="fr_1251"></span>[3](#fn_1247), he *should* come
immediately (di*g*andyî*s*) unto Pârs, I *shall* then be seeking an
opportunity even for the retirement of him himself; I do not abominate
*it* (madam lâ man*s*ôm) when it is necessary for them *and* private, as
is better.

8\. As to these other diffusions of arrangements which are pre-eminently
the resources of that priestly man, and the acquaintance with revelation
which is sought by him, for the sake of the advantage of the religion
they should not be molested before <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[4](#fn_1248).

9\. May the arrangement and restoration and benediction of the
revelation (dîn 6) of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion reach a climax!
and may the

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

eminence of you listeners <span id="fr_1253"></span>[1](#fn_1249) to the
primeval religion consist in long-continued, supreme prosperity, through
all happiness! then, through such thoughtful friends, the acquaintance
*with* its difficult teaching and mighty words, which is to increase
that gratitude of yours to me for my decisions, is made a blessing to
you, if you observe therein a good idea which seems to you important,
when it reaches your sight.

10\. The correct writer *and* scribe is ordered that he do not alter
*any* of <span id="fr_1254"></span>[2](#fn_1250) the words (mârîk),
while he writes a fair copy of this epistle of mine, which is written by
me to you, and he orders *some one* to give *it* to *that* same man,
Ya*zd*ân-pânak, *along* with that epistle, so that it *may* come to
him <span id="fr_1255"></span>[3](#fn_1251), for there are *times* when
I seem aware that *it* is better *so*. 11. And may the angels increase
*and* enlarge your many new *things* with full measure and complete
exaltation! the pleasure, peace <span id="fr_1256"></span>[4](#fn_1252),
righteousness, prosperity, commendation, *and* happiness *of* the
powerful <span id="fr_1257"></span>[5](#fn_1253) who are all-controlling
*and* happy-ending.

12\. Mânû*sk*îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, *has* written *it in* the day *and*
month *of* Spenda*r*ma*d* <span id="fr_1258"></span>[6](#fn_1254), in
the

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

enjoyment of righteousness, the glorification of the religion,
trustfulness to the angels, and gratitude unto the creator
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the archangels, *and* all the angels of the spiritual
*and* the angels of the worldly *existences*. 13. Praise to the month
(mâh) of like kind which is exalted in its name with this.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[320:3](sbe18112.htm#fr_1243) Not Ep. II, but
one which preceded it (see § 5, note).

<span id="fn_1240"></span>[321:1](sbe18112.htm#fr_1244) From pollution,
by means of the Bareshnûm ceremony.

<span id="fn_1241"></span>[321:2](sbe18112.htm#fr_1245) Probably
referring to Ep. II, till the arrival of which (or that of Ep. III) they
were to act as directed by the priest he sends with this epistle.

<span id="fn_1242"></span>[321:3](sbe18112.htm#fr_1246) His brother
Zâ*d*-sparam.

<span id="fn_1243"></span>[321:4](sbe18112.htm#fr_1247) This intended
visit to Sîrkân is also mentioned in Ep. II, v, 5; vi, 4, 6; vii, 3.

<span id="fn_1244"></span>[321:5](sbe18112.htm#fr_1248) Being
apprehensive that personal interference might lead to altercations
derogatory to his dignity, he prefers trying the effect of writing in
the first place. The temporary epistle, here referred to, <span
id="page_322">p. 322</span> could not have been Ep. II, as that was
written after Ep. III, and was the further epistle promised in § 6.

<span id="fn_1245"></span>[322:1](sbe18112.htm#fr_1249) Or, perhaps,
Ya*zd*ân-pahnak. This was a common Parsi name in former times, as it is
found in two of the Pahlavi inscriptions in the Kanheri caves, dated
A.D. 1009 (see Indian Antiquary, vol. ix, pp. 266, 267), and the very
similar name, Yazd-panâh, occurs as the name of a Parsi convert to
Christianity who was put to death about A.D. 541 (see Hoffmann's Auszüge
aus syrischen Akten persischer Märtyrer, p. 87).

<span id="fn_1246"></span>[322:2](sbe18112.htm#fr_1250) Assuming that
dinhâr*d*ŏ stands for zinhârî*d*ŏ.

<span id="fn_1247"></span>[322:3](sbe18112.htm#fr_1251) If I should come
personally.

<span id="fn_1248"></span>[322:4](sbe18112.htm#fr_1252) Referring
probably to further matters of complaint, which he did not think it
advisable to notice seriously until the present controversy was settled.

<span id="fn_1249"></span>[323:1](sbe18112.htm#fr_1253) Reading
nyôkhshî*d*ârânŏ, as in J, instead of avakhshî*d*ârânŏ.

<span id="fn_1250"></span>[323:2](sbe18112.htm#fr_1254) Reading min,
instead of mûn, 'who.'

<span id="fn_1251"></span>[323:3](sbe18112.htm#fr_1255) To Zâ*d*-sparam.
This copy was that mentioned in Ep. II, vii, I.

<span id="fn_1252"></span>[323:4](sbe18112.htm#fr_1256) Reading slam, as
in J; the other MSS. have shnuman, 'propitiation,' the two words being
nearly alike in Pahlavi letters.

<span id="fn_1253"></span>[323:5](sbe18112.htm#fr_1257) Reading
patûgânŏ; J has pa*d*vandânŏ, 'connections,' by inserting a stroke.

<span id="fn_1254"></span>[323:6](sbe18112.htm#fr_1258) The fifth day of
the twelfth month of the Parsi year; and, as Ep. III (which was
evidently written after further consideration) is dated in the third
month of A. Y. 250, this must have been written in A.Y. 249. The date of
this epistle, therefore, corresponds to the 15th March, 881.
