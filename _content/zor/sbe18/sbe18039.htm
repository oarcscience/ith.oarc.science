<p>1. The thirty-first question is that which you ask thus: When he who is wicked goes to hell, how</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A></p>  
<p>does he go, <I>and in</I> what manner does he go; also, who comes to meet him, and who leads him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to hell; also, does any one of the infernal ones (d&ucirc;<I>s</I>ah&ucirc;&icirc;k&acirc;n&#335;) come to meet him, or how is it? 2. Shall they also inflict punishment upon him, for the sin which he <I>has</I> committed, at once, or is his punishment the same until the future existence? 3. Also, what is their food in hell, and of what description are their pain <I>and</I> discomfort; <I>and</I> is the limit of hell manifest, or how is it?</p>  
<p>4. The reply is this, that a soul of the wicked, the fourth night after passing away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>its</I> account <I>being</I> rendered, rolls head-foremost and totters (kap&icirc;n&ecirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) from the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> bridge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; and V&icirc;zar&acirc;sh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, the demon, conveys (n&acirc;ye<I>d</I>&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> him cruelly bound therefrom, and leads him unto hell. 5 And with him are the spirits <I>and</I> demons connected with the sin of that <I>soul</I>, watching in many guises, resembling the very producers of doubt (v&icirc;mand&acirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r&acirc;n-i<I>k</I>), the wounders, slayers, destroyers, deadly ones, monsters (d&ucirc;<I>s</I>-gerp&acirc;no), and criminals,</p>

<p>those <I>who</I> are unseemly, those, too, <I>who</I> are diseased <I>and</I> polluted, biters and tearers, noxious creatures, windy stenches, glooms, fiery stenches, thirsty ones, those of evil habits, disturbers of sleep (khv&acirc;p-kh&acirc;r&acirc;n), and other special causers of sin and kinds of perverting, with whom, in worldly semblance, are the spiritual causers of distress. 6. And proportional <I>to</I> the strength <I>and</I> power which <I>have</I> become theirs, owing to his sin, they surround him uncomfortably, and make him experience vexation, even unto the time of the renovation <I>of the universe</I>. 7. And through the leading of V&icirc;zar&acirc;sh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he comes unwillingly unto hell, becomes a household attendant (khavag-&icirc;-m&acirc;n&ocirc;&icirc;-a&icirc;t&#335;) of the fiend and evil <I>one</I>, is repentant of the delusion of a desire for fables (vardak&icirc;h&acirc;), is a longer for <I>getting</I> away from hell to the world, and <I>has</I> a wonderful desire for good works.</p>  
<p>8. And his food is as 'a sample of those which are among the most fetid, most putrid, most polluted, and most thoroughly unpleasant; and <I>there</I> is no enjoyment and completeness <I>in</I> his eating, but he shall devour (<I>g</I>a<I>l</I>&acirc;<I>d</I>) with a craving which keeps him hungry and thirsty, due to water <I>which</I> is hastily <I>sipped</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 9. Owing to that vicious habit <I>there</I> is no satisfaction therefrom, but it increases his haste and the punishment, rapidity, and tediousness of his anguish.</p>  
<p>10. The locality&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in hell is not limited (s&acirc;m&acirc;n&icirc;a&icirc;t)</p>

<p>before the resurrection, <I>and</I> until the time of the renovation <I>of the universe he</I> is in hell. 11. Also out of his sin is the punishment connected <I>with it</I>, and that punishment comes upon him, from the fiend <I>and</I> spirit of his own sin, in that manner and proportion with which he <I>has</I> harassed and vexed <I>others</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and <I>has</I> reverenced, praised, and served that which is vile.</p>  
<p>12. And at the time of the renovation, when the fiend perishes, the souls of the wicked pass into melted metal (ay&ecirc;n&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>for</I> three days; and all fiends and evil thoughts, which are owing to their sin, have anguish effectually, and are hurried <I>away</I> by the cutting and breaking <I>away</I> of the accumulation (ham-d&acirc;<I>d</I>ak&icirc;h) of sin of the wicked souls. 13. And by that pre-eminent (a<I>v</I>art&ucirc;m) ablution in the melted metal they are thoroughly purified from guilt and infamy (dast&#335; va raspak&#335;), and through the perseverance (khv&acirc;par&icirc;h)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and mercifulness of the pre-eminent persistent ones they are pardoned, and become most saintly (m&ocirc;gt&ucirc;m) pure ones; as it is said in metaphor that the pure are <I>of</I> two kinds, one which is glorious (khv&acirc;rvat&ocirc;), <I>and</I> one which is metallic (ay&ecirc;navat&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>14. And after that purification <I>there</I> are no demons, no punishment, <I>and</I> no hell as regards the wicked, and their disposal (v&icirc;r&acirc;stak&#335;) also is just; they become righteous, painless, deathless, fearless, and free from harm. 15. And with them comes the spirit of the good works which were done <I>and</I> instigated by them in the world, and procures them pleasure and joy in the degree and proportion of those good works. 16. But the recompense of a soul of the righteous is a better formation (v&ecirc;hd&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;h) and more&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_229"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_230">71:1</A> M14 and J omit the words from 'also' to 'leads him.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_230"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_231">71:2</A> The term 'passing away' is here used with reference to the death of a wicked person, contrary to the general rule (see Chap. XX, 2).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_231"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_232">71:3</A> See Chap. XX, 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_232"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_233">71:4</A> 'Then the fiend, named V&icirc;zaresha, carries off in bonds the souls of the wicked Da&ecirc;va-worshippers who live in sin' (Vend. XIX, 94, trans. D.); see also Bd. XXVIII, 18, where the name is V&icirc;zar&ecirc;sh, but it is always V&icirc;zar&acirc;sh in Dd. Here it has been first miswritten in K35, and afterwards corrected, so that later copyists have read V&icirc;r&acirc;sh, as in M14 and J.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_233"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_234">71:5</A> Identifying the verb with Av. nay&ecirc;iti of Vend. V, 25, 31; or it may be read v&acirc;ye<I>d</I>&#335;, and identified with Av. vay&ecirc;iti of Vend. XV, 17, or Av. v&acirc;dhay&ecirc;iti of Vend. XIX, 94, without much change of meaning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_234"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_235">72:1</A> See &sect; 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_235"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_236">72:2</A> Referring to the fact that a person who is both hungry and thirsty cannot quench his thirst, for more than a few minutes, by drinking water without eating.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_236"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_237">72:3</A> Or, perhaps, 'his position,' if we read d&icirc;v&acirc;k-a<I>s</I> instead of <A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A> d&icirc;v&acirc;k&icirc;h, but the former reading would be more of a modern Persian idiom than a Pahlavi one.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_237"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_238">73:1</A> Or, '<I>the good</I>;' the word is not expressed in the Pahlavi text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_238"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_239">73:2</A> Bd. XXX, 20 states that both the righteous and wicked are finally purified by melted metal which is a torment to the latter, but only like a bath in warm milk to the former.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_239"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_240">73:3</A> See Chap. XIX, 7 n.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_240"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_241">73:4</A> This is probably a misapplication of a Pahlavi phrase which contained the word &acirc;snavat&ocirc;, 'indestructible,' and was the translation of an Avesta passage containing the words <I>h</I><I>v</I>&acirc;thravan<I>d</I>, 'brilliant, glorious,' and &acirc;sna,' stony, indestructible, enduring' (often translated 'heavenly'), which words are sometimes used together, <A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A> as in Yas. LIX, 14. As the Pahl. &acirc;snavat&ocirc; and ay&ecirc;navat&#335; are written alike they are easily confounded, but that 'metal' is meant here appears from Yas. L, 9, b, Bd. XXX, 20.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_241"></A><A HREF="sbe18039.htm#fr_242">74:1</A> M14 has 'and the position of more good works is better, the rank is greater, and the pleasure and delight more.'</P>
