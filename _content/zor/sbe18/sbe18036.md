### CHAPTER XXIX.

1\. The twenty-eighth question is that you ask thus: For what reason is
it not allowable to perform

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

the ceremony of Srôsh, the living spirit (ahvô) <span
id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_184), *along* with other propitiations
(shnûmanŏ) <span id="fr_186"></span>[2](#fn_185), when they reverence
him separately?

2\. The reply is this, that the lord of all *things* is the creator who
is persistent over his own creatures, and a precious work is his own
true service <span id="fr_187"></span>[3](#fn_186) which is given by him
to Srôsh the righteous whom, for this reason, *one* is to reverence
separately when even his name is not frequently mentioned, and *one* is
not even to reverence the names of the archangels with him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_184"></span>[61:1](sbe18036.htm#fr_185) Probably a
miswriting of ashôk, 'righteous.'

<span id="fn_185"></span>[61:2](sbe18036.htm#fr_186) Short formulas of
praise, reciting all the usual titles of the spirits intended to be
propitiated by them, which are introduced into a particular part of the
liturgy to dedicate the ceremony to the particular spirit in whose
honour it is being performed (see Sls. VII, 8).

<span id="fn_186"></span>[61:3](sbe18036.htm#fr_187) Reading bôndakîh;
but it may be bûndakîh, 'completeness, perfection.'
