### CHAPTER III.

1\. *It* is disquieting about this, too, which is declared in your
writing <span id="fr_1303"></span>[3](#fn_1298), as regards *your*
vehement desire and embarrassment (rûzdîh) for a new law, and *your*
wish and longing. for the establishment of the law of the apostles <span
id="fr_1304"></span>[4](#fn_1299); as also that which you *have* done
about the gathering of the details of statements from the three
teachings <span id="fr_1305"></span>[5](#fn_1300), *and* about

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

causing the rapid bringing of the new law. 2. And on account of your
embarrassment and wrong-*doing* (va*d*ag) they would give up the
Frasnât*e*ê ('washing upwards <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1](#fn_1301))
and Upasnât*e*ê ('washing downwards'), to bring the fifteen *times*
which are without ordinance (ba*r*â âînakŏ), that are after it <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[2](#fn_1302), back to the fifteen which are a
portion of the ordinance (âînakŏ vâî).

3\. *As to* the three times, each of which times *one* runs a mile
(hâsar) even until he obtains a purifier <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[3](#fn_1303), since peradventure thy mile
(parasang), too, *might* become more, all the good work is written
purposely (a*g*-karîhâ) of three miles and more <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[4](#fn_1304). 4. And that, too, which the
high-priests have so appointed, when *he has* striven in that manner for
three persons <span id="fr_1310"></span>[5](#fn_1305), or that sin and
retribution of his is apportioned unto them *and* brought to the balance
(san*g*ag-âînî*d*ŏ), is because that commission and retribution of sin
*might* now, peradventure, be

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

allotted unto the priest <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1](#fn_1306); for if
*he were* impure (pali*s*tŏ) there *would* be no one whatever who would
properly perform the purification as it is necessary.

5\. Then it *has* become indispensable *for* you to perform the
purification, for that operation--so suitable for the discreet where 'he
who *has been* by the dead <span id="fr_1312"></span>[2](#fn_1307),' so
that he has become polluted, and even 'the stars and moon and sun shine
upon his life discontentedly'--is just as fit for the exalted when there
is great 'propitiation of fire, water, earth, cattle, righteous males,
and righteous women' thereby. 6. So great is *its* value *that* where
there is no purification *of* the body *it* is not possible to purify
the life *and* soul; *and* when there is a man in a realm who is able to
perform it, that man is not justifiable except when he shall perform
*it*.

7\. Finally, when that pre-eminent operation is *being* accomplished,
over which *there* is in revelation and the perfect information due to
revelation that supreme <span id="fr_1313"></span>[3](#fn_1308) control
which you are so disputing in the religion--which even through your
trifling (khûr*d*akŏ) in the name of authority is becoming a struggle
(patkâr-yehevûn)--then, though it may not be possible for you to perform
*it* yourself, it should thereupon be the duty of some one of your
*disciples* to perform it in your sight, so that you *may* be aware of
the rite, even apart from the great resources in *that* most learned
(â*z*tûm) acquaintance

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

with revelation which is associated with you <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[1](#fn_1309). 8. Also from that which is repeatedly
written by you with understanding of the rite, as regards all three
teachings <span id="fr_1315"></span>[2](#fn_1310), *it* is manifest
those rites are mentioned even *as* those *which* are more maintained,
*and* are not those which are unnecessary to perform. 9. You are a
something therein that *tends* to preserve <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[3](#fn_1311) a little *of* what it is not possible
for thee to attain fully in any mode; when thou shalt obtain the
operations of the voice <span id="fr_1317"></span>[4](#fn_1312), and the
water and bull's urine, as well as the three men <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[5](#fn_1313), or thou shalt give a man <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[6](#fn_1314) to wash therein, the intellect of
those controlling is then, indeed, not preservative therein.

10\. It is proper also for you to consecrate the water *and* bull's
urine by that ritual which is in all three teachings, to prepare your
own ritualistic liquid *and* other *things* which are approved among you
with mutual assistance, *and* to appoint a purifier who *has* performed
fully acceptably *and* been wanted. 11. Then, to give *out* properly to
the country that the purification, is according to my order, I always

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

perform *it* more acceptably than that of other purifiers. 12. For the
water *and* bull's urine are all consecrated by me, and the three
hundred pebbles (sang <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1](#fn_1315)) are cast
into them (aûba*s*) by me, just as it is directed; the operation is also
directed by me in the three days <span id="fr_1321"></span>[2](#fn_1316)
when it is performed, and all the customary *parts* are washed three
times by me <span id="fr_1322"></span>[3](#fn_1317); the ablution seats
(makŏ) are also arranged by me anew for every single person, and the use
of washed seats is not ordered by me therein <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[4](#fn_1318); every rite of the washing by the
purifier is also so performed by me as all three teachings have
mentioned as perfection. 13. You become the best of the district, as
regards the minutiae (bârîkî*d*ôân) of the purification that is within
your duty, so long as they excite the sight <span
id="fr_1324"></span>[5](#fn_1319), *but* which are curtailed (kazd) by
you in the way of washing disclosed to me <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[6](#fn_1320), while, when it should be performed by
you in this manner, your performance would be equally constantly
extolled *and* your writing praised.

14\. When, then, you write of it that they should always perform it just
as now, the falsity therein is

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

grievous (yagar), and I know none worse; for this washing and
professional purification which *one* is to keep in operation--as is
declared by revelation, the teaching of high-priests, and those of the
primitive faith who are esteemable <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[1](#fn_1321)--you withdraw (madam dârê*d*ŏ) from
the midst *of us*. 15. That *which* you understand yourself is that unto
Aûha*r*ma*zd* the confederate good creatures are as *it were* defiled
*and* in the eyes of the good *and* wise *they are* as *it were*
propitiatory towards the mischievous Vâê <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[2](#fn_1322). 16. And your words about it are just
as they say concerning a beggar <span id="fr_1328"></span>[3](#fn_1323),
where a garment is given to him, thus: 'Wash the dirt (âlûg) on him
thoroughly clean;' *and* that garment they shall take is put upon the
fire *and* burnt; and he spoke thus: 'My dirt *was* a comfort.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1298"></span>[336:3](sbe18115.htm#fr_1303) The decree
mentioned in Chap. II, 1.

<span id="fn_1299"></span>[336:4](sbe18115.htm#fr_1304) That is, the new
law which the future apostles, Hûshê*d*ar, Hûshê*d*ar-mâh, and Sôshâns
(see Dd. II, 10) are expected to bring, so as to restore the religion in
preparation for the resurrection.

<span id="fn_1300"></span>[336:5](sbe18115.htm#fr_1305) Those of
Mê*d*yôk-mâh, Afarg, and Sôshâns (see Ep. I, v, 1, 6).

<span id="fn_1301"></span>[337:1](sbe18115.htm#fr_1306) These terms are
quoted from Vend. VIII, 276, 279 (see App. V), and are thus explained in
Pahlavi in Chap. IV, 2.

<span id="fn_1302"></span>[337:2](sbe18115.htm#fr_1307) Referring,
apparently, to the second mention' of the fifteen washings, in Pahl.
Vend. VIII, 281, which does not occur in the Avesta text ('the
ordinance'), but refers to its previous occurrence in § 279 of the
Avesta. But, perhaps, the author means that they would confound the
final washing appointed in Vend. VIII, 299 with the preliminary washing
appointed in the previous § 279.

<span id="fn_1303"></span>[337:3](sbe18115.htm#fr_1308) See Vend. VIII,
280, 287, 295 (compare App. V and Ep. I, ii, 6, note).

<span id="fn_1304"></span>[337:4](sbe18115.htm#fr_1309) After the
polluted person has thrice run a mile, he is to run further (see Vend.
VIII, 294) to some inhabited spot; from which directions the author
concludes that any excess of distance is immaterial. K35 and BK have
'four miles and more,' but this seems to be a copyist's blunder.

<span id="fn_1305"></span>[337:5](sbe18115.htm#fr_1310) To purify him,
and, if they refuse, they each take a share of his sin (see Vend. VIII,
280-293),

<span id="fn_1306"></span>[338:1](sbe18115.htm#fr_1311) Who is to purify
him finally with the Bareshnûm ceremony.

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[338:2](sbe18115.htm#fr_1312) Referring to
Vend. IX, 161-1 63, quoted at length in Ep. I, iv, 3.

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[338:3](sbe18115.htm#fr_1313) Reading mahîstô,
but it can also be read Ma*zd*ayastô, 'Ma*zd*a-worshipping.'

<span id="fn_1309"></span>[339:1](sbe18115.htm#fr_1314) That is, even
when not performing the ceremony himself, his presence would be
desirable, for the sake of securing due attention to all the details,
with which his superior knowledge must make him better acquainted than
his subordinates.

<span id="fn_1310"></span>[339:2](sbe18115.htm#fr_1315) See § 1.

<span id="fn_1311"></span>[339:3](sbe18115.htm#fr_1316) Reading
bûkhtanŏ; the MSS. divide the word, so as to convert it into ba*r*â
tanû,' without a body.' The meaning is that by his presence he is, at
all events, able to secure some efficiency in the ceremony, when he is
compelled to intrust its performance to subordinates who are not fully
competent.

<span id="fn_1312"></span>[339:4](sbe18115.htm#fr_1317) In the prayers
and exorcisms.

<span id="fn_1313"></span>[339:5](sbe18115.htm#fr_1318) See § 4.

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[339:6](sbe18115.htm#fr_1319) That is, one
thoroughly qualified (the priest mentioned in § 4) who requires no
special supervision.

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[340:1](sbe18115.htm#fr_1320) See Ep. I, vii,
16.

<span id="fn_1316"></span>[340:2](sbe18115.htm#fr_1321) The 'three
washings' mentioned in Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, *o* (see App. IV); referring
probably to those after the third, sixth, and ninth nights (see Vend.
IX, 136, 140, 144), that is, on the fourth, seventh, and tenth days of
the Bareshnûm ceremony. Most of this clause is omitted in J.

<span id="fn_1317"></span>[340:3](sbe18115.htm#fr_1322) As said to have
been directed by Mê*d*yôk-mâh (see Chap. 71, 6, Ep. I, vi, 7), though
the extant Pahlavi Vendidâ*d* (IX, 132, *j*) attributes the order to
Afarg.

<span id="fn_1318"></span>[340:4](sbe18115.htm#fr_1323) Compare Ep. I,
ix, 7, Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, o, s.

<span id="fn_1319"></span>[340:5](sbe18115.htm#fr_1324) J has 'so long
as they advance the purification as much as possible by a resemblance so
approved,'

<span id="fn_1320"></span>[340:6](sbe18115.htm#fr_1325) In the heretical
decree under consideration.

<span id="fn_1321"></span>[341:1](sbe18115.htm#fr_1326) That is, by the
Avesta and Zand.

<span id="fn_1322"></span>[341:2](sbe18115.htm#fr_1327) Reading anâkŏ
Vâê; he is the demon that carries off the soul (see Dd. XXX, 4). Even
the best creatures are imperfect in the eyes of Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the
righteous.

<span id="fn_1323"></span>[341:3](sbe18115.htm#fr_1328) Reading
niyâ*z*kar, instead of the niyâ*z*ar, of the MSS.
