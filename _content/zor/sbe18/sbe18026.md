### CHAPTER XVIII.

1\. The seventeenth question is that you ask thus: Is it better when
they give *it* to the birds, or what mode is better?

2\. The reply is this, that after showing the dog--the reason of which
is as declared <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_117) in its own
chapter--they shall carry the corpse at once to the hills and rising
ground (vakhsh bûm); and, for the reason that the dogs *and* birds
should not bring that dead matter away to a watered, cultivated, *or*
inhabited place, *one* is to fasten *it in* the manner of a thief <span
id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_118). 3. When the corpse-eating birds have
eaten the fat, that fat which, when it is not possible to eat *it*,
becomes rotten, offensive, and fraught with noxious creatures, then
*men* shall properly convey the bones away to the bone-receptacle
(astôdânŏ), which <span id="fr_120"></span>[3](#fn_119) *one* is to
elevate so from the ground, *and* over which <span
id="fr_121"></span>[4](#fn_120) a roof (â*s*kûpŏ) so stands, that in no
way does the rain fall upon the dead matter, nor the water reach up to
it therein, nor the damp make up to it therein, nor are the dog and fox
able to go to it, and for the sake of light coming to it a hole is made
therein.

4\. More authoritatively (dastôbarîhâ) it is said that bone-receptacle
is a vault (ka*d*akŏ) of solid stone <span
id="fr_122"></span>[5](#fn_121), and its covering (nihûmbakŏ) *one* is
to

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

construct also of a single stone which is cut perforated (sûlâk-hômand),
and around it *one* is to fill in with stone and mortar <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_122).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_117"></span>[43:1](sbe18026.htm#fr_118) Literally 'as the
reason of it is declared.' This is another allusion to the missing
chapter mentioned in Chap. XVII, 20.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[43:2](sbe18026.htm#fr_119) Reading âhûn
khadûînŏ, but this is very likely a corruption of khadûînŏ khadûînŏ,
'*in* various modes.'

<span id="fn_119"></span>[43:3](sbe18026.htm#fr_120) The MSS. have
mûnam, 'which by me.'

<span id="fn_120"></span>[43:4](sbe18026.htm#fr_121) The MSS. have min
madam, 'from above.'

<span id="fn_121"></span>[43:5](sbe18026.htm#fr_122) Whether
khadûkŏ-sagakŏ means 'solid rock' or 'solid ashlar' is doubtful.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[44:1](sbe18026.htm#fr_123) Perhaps the single
stone is not to cover the whole space, but merely to contain the opening
for light, and to be set in a vaulted roof of ashlar or rubble;
otherwise it is not clear where the filling with stone and mortar is to
be placed. This bone-receptacle was to be provided for the bones of
those corpses which were deposited on the open ground. In the enclosed
depositories, used in India, the bone-receptacle is a circular well in
the centre, from which the rain does not appear to be excluded (see Sls.
II, 6, note).
