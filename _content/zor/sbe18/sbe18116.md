### CHAPTER IV.

1\. *It* <span id="fr_1329"></span>[4](#fn_1324) is both explained again
*and* summarized *thus*:--If the decree be from a law of Zaratû*s*t, is
it so decreed as he spoke it? and if they should never perform by that,
do not bring the Avesta *and its* exposition into the midst *of it*. 2.
For the fifteen times *of* which you *have* written, if from the
revelation of Zaratû*s*t, are his mode of *washing* fifteen times
upwards and fifteen times downwards <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[5](#fn_1325), a rule

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

which is fulfilled. 3. *It* is said, if *one's defilement be* owing to
depositing any bodily refuse (higar-1), then nothing of this is ever
necessary for him, for one reckoning (mar-1) <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[1](#fn_1326) will smite that which he takes hold of
with a finger and *it* is clean, or it will smite a golden yellow clean,
or whatever <span id="fr_1332"></span>[2](#fn_1327) it shall smite is
clean; but nothing *merely* clean is purified, unless a demon be
clean <span id="fr_1333"></span>[3](#fn_1328).

4\. And this, too, is very amazing to me, that when this is not taken
into account by you, that when there should be, *and one* should obtain,
no purifier <span id="fr_1334"></span>[4](#fn_1329) it would then be
necessary for him to operate himself <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[5](#fn_1330), how then is this knowledge obtained
by you, on which information (âgahîh) *has* reached you, that the
purifying of all the purifiers of the country of Irân is just as they
should always perform *it*. 5. When, as I consider, there is then no
complete acquaintance *with* the management of a house in you, its own
master, in what manner then is our account of the gossip <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[6](#fn_1331), *and your* information, about all the
purifiers of the country of Irân

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

obtained? 6. If your *people* should abandon that *which is* most
indispensable, and your account of the gossip, as regards that which the
whole realm *has* done, *be* not according to the commands of religion
and to sound wisdom; *and* if it has not come completely to your
knowledge as the washing of the purifiers of the country of
Irân--because, when you do not fix the number even of their
footsteps <span id="fr_1337"></span>[1](#fn_1332), *it* is certain that
*your* understanding of their disposition *and* virtuous practice is
even less--then it was necessary for you to determine the reason that
all the purifiers in the country of Irân always wash that way that is
declared as improper, with whatever certainty *it be* uttered *or*
written.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1324"></span>[341:4](sbe18116.htm#fr_1329) His own line of
argument.

<span id="fn_1325"></span>[341:5](sbe18116.htm#fr_1330) See Chap. III,
2.

<span id="fn_1326"></span>[342:1](sbe18116.htm#fr_1331) That is, a
single washing, which is sufficient for ordinary defilements unconnected
with the dead.

<span id="fn_1327"></span>[342:2](sbe18116.htm#fr_1332) This is
doubtful; the word seems to be *k*îkê in Pâzand, but, as the Av. î and û
are much alike in Iranian MSS., it may be read *k*ûk-ê, and the phrase
would then be 'or it will smite a penis clean.'

<span id="fn_1328"></span>[342:3](sbe18116.htm#fr_1333) That is,
cleanliness can no more be considered purification than a demon, who is
supposed to be an embodiment of impurity, can be considered clean.

<span id="fn_1329"></span>[342:4](sbe18116.htm#fr_1334) J has 'when
there should be no purifier it would be necessary to beg the help of a
chief of the religion, and when *one* should not obtain *that*.'

<span id="fn_1330"></span>[342:5](sbe18116.htm#fr_1335) As directed in
Vend. VIII, 299 (see App. V).

<span id="fn_1331"></span>[342:6](sbe18116.htm#fr_1336) Reading va*k*
sakhûn, but this is uncertain.

<span id="fn_1332"></span>[343:1](sbe18116.htm#fr_1337) Referring
probably either to the distance of the Bareshnûm place from pure
objects, or to the distances between the holes or ablution seats, and
from them to the furrows, mentioned in Vend. IX, 12, 24, 18, 22 (see
App. IV).
