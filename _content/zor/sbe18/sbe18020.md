### CHAPTER XII.

1\. The eleventh question is that you ask thus: Does the growth of a
good work eradicate sin just like the original good work, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that the growth does eradicate *it*, as happens
*with* the good work which is for atonement for sin; it shall be done as
retribution for sin, *and* it eradicates the sin, which is specially
mentioned in revelation <span id="fr_86"></span>[5](#fn_85). 3. 'Then
the place of his

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

other good work is evidently the soul; and, in order to be with the sin
at *its* origin, it remains *and* is taken into account.' 4. 'Through
good works and the growth of good works is the recompense of the soul,
so that they should do those good works in atonement for sin.' 5. And
concerning the sin eradicated it is said: 'An original good work
eradicates original sin <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_86), and the
growth of a good work *eradicates* the growth of a sin.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_85"></span>[30:5](sbe18020.htm#fr_86) See Pahl. Vend. VII,
136, where the matter is mentioned, but <span id="page_31">p. 31</span>
the passages which seem to be quoted here must be from some other
source.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[31:1](sbe18020.htm#fr_87) Literally 'sinning of
the beginning' (bûn-vinâsîh). It must mean the first commission of any
particular sin, and has no connection with the 'original sin' of
Christian writers.
