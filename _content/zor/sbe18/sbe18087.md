### CHAPTER LXXX.

1\. *As to* the seventy-ninth question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: Concerning him who does not order *ceremonies* what is then the
decision?

2\. The reply is this, that, excepting those. among which is specially
the selected religious rite (dînô) of him whose ceremony is not
performed--who, even though *having* many good works, does not
afterwards attain unto the supreme heaven, which is determined <span
id="fr_891"></span>[1](#fn_888)--this, moreover, is thus said, that he
who is not able to perform his ritual himself, when he orders a
Gêtô-kharî*d* <span id="fr_892"></span>[2](#fn_889) *ceremony* and they
shall perform *it*, can become *fit* for the supreme heaven
(garô*d*mânîkŏ); this is greatly to be commended.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_888"></span>[237:1](sbe18087.htm#fr_891) It is the general
opinion that if the proper ceremonies are not performed during the three
days after a death (see Chap. XXVIII) the deceased cannot attain to the
highest grade of heaven; this is, however, denied by some of the
commentators (see Sls. VI, 3-6).
