<P><A NAME="fn_1015"></A><A HREF="sbe18101.htm#fr_1018">269:3</A> The first eleven sections of this chapter are quoted from the beginning of the sixth book of the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I>, which commences as follows:--'The propitiation of the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is even in the benedictions of the religion of Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship; this, too, was the settled decision of those of the primitive faith. The sixth <I>book</I> is on a compendium (vasang) which <I>was</I> prepared by those of the primitive faith to maintain about the sayings of the religion of Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship;' and then proceeds as in our text, with the variations and additional matter mentioned in the foot-notes. It is hardly probable that these quotations were intended as a conclusion to any reply, the beginning of which may be lost, as they refer to a variety of subjects; but they may have been selected by the author as authoritative opinions sufficiently comprehensive for his general peroration. At any rate they show that the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I> must have been in existence in its present form before the D&acirc;<I>d</I>ist&acirc;n-&icirc; D&icirc;n&icirc;k was written. All the MSS. have this peroration written continuously with the preceding chapter, without stop or break of any kind to indicate a change of subject.</P>

And this, too, <I>was</I> thus considered by them, that the essential thing of the primitive faith is freedom from sin. And this, too, <I>was</I> thus considered by them, that <I>one</I> becomes diligent about that <I>with</I> which <I>he</I> is conversant.

<P><A NAME="fn_1054"></A><A HREF="sbe18101.htm#fr_1058">273:5</A> In Dk. the following is here inserted:--'And this, too, <I>was</I> thus considered by them, that people are to keep an eye most diligently on the world <I>for</I> these three things: that which is realisable <I>by</I> a sinner through sin, a follower made famous, <I>and</I> to beg the recompense of good works from the spirits: and keeping their eye on the world is said <I>to be</I> this, that <I>it is he</I> who observes himself, so that <I>a part</I> of whatever he really desires he should always perform. And this, too, <I>was</I> thus considered by them, that three <A NAME="page_273"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 273</FONT></A> things which are very difficult to do are even such as these: one is not to render the sinfulness famous by the sin; one is not to exalt the opinions of the fiend, and the various sovereignties of the evil <I>one</I>, for the sake of wealth; and one is to beg the recompense of good works from the spirits, <I>and</I> not from the world.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1055"></A><A HREF="sbe18101.htm#fr_1059">274:1</A> Dk. has merely 'keeps.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1058"></A><A HREF="sbe18101.htm#fr_1062">274:4</A> The oldest MS. of Dk. has 'though <I>some</I> of the much happiness of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>,' &amp;c., as in the latter part of the section, omitting the passage referring to Aharman and hell; later MSS., however, insert a modified version of the omitted passage, and read as follows: 'When even here <I>it</I> is so happy at the period when it should be distressing <I>and</I> the mischievous vexation of much pain has come; this, too, is to be considered, that misery, indeed, is the calamity (&acirc;fat&#335;) there in hell, when even here <I>it</I> is so, though <I>some</I> of the much happiness of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>,' &amp;c.. as before. This interpolation in Dk. is evidently modern (as the word &acirc;fat&#335; is Arabic and not Pahlavi), and was probably composed by a copyist in India who was acquainted with the text of Dk.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1061"></A><A HREF="sbe18101.htm#fr_1065">275:3</A> Dk. concludes as follows: '<I>who has</I> done those things which are done, <I>about</I> which <I>on his</I> last day--when the things of the world depart--his wish is then thus, that 'more endeavour should be made by me;' <I>and has exercised</I> much abstinence from those things <I>about</I> which his last day's wish is this, that the endeavour made should not be made.'

<P><A NAME="fn_1065"></A><A HREF="sbe18101.htm#fr_1069">276:3</A> This title seems to be always spelt in Pahlavi with &acirc; in the middle syllable, so that the form frama<FONT SIZE="-1">DH</FONT>&acirc;r in N&#335;ldeke's Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden, p. 9, must be looked upon as an Arabic corruption, and the idea that it means 'a preceder or one who has precedence' can hardly be maintained. It probably stands for farm&acirc;&icirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r, 'a director or commander,' not in a military sense. It occurs also in Bd. XXXIII, 2, where the title 'a great farm&acirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r' is evidently equivalent to 'prime minister, or grand vaz&icirc;r,' but applied to a priest, as farm&acirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r is here and in Chap.
