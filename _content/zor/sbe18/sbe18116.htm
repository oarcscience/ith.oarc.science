<p>1. <I>It</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1329"></A><A HREF="#fn_1324"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is both explained again <I>and</I> summarized <I>thus</I>:--If the decree be from a law of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, is it so decreed as he spoke it? and if they should never perform by that, do not bring the Avesta <I>and its</I> exposition into the midst <I>of it</I>. 2. For the fifteen times <I>of</I> which you <I>have</I> written, if from the revelation of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, are his mode of <I>washing</I> fifteen times upwards and fifteen times downwards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1330"></A><A HREF="#fn_1325"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, a rule</p>

<p>which is fulfilled. 3. <I>It</I> is said, if <I>one's defilement be</I> owing to depositing any bodily refuse (higar-1), then nothing of this is ever necessary for him, for one reckoning (mar-1)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1331"></A><A HREF="#fn_1326"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> will smite that which he takes hold of with a finger and <I>it</I> is clean, or it will smite a golden yellow clean, or whatever&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1332"></A><A HREF="#fn_1327"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> it shall smite is clean; but nothing <I>merely</I> clean is purified, unless a demon be clean&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1333"></A><A HREF="#fn_1328"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>4. And this, too, is very amazing to me, that when this is not taken into account by you, that when there should be, <I>and one</I> should obtain, no purifier&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1334"></A><A HREF="#fn_1329"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> it would then be necessary for him to operate himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1335"></A><A HREF="#fn_1330"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, how then is this knowledge obtained by you, on which information (&acirc;gah&icirc;h) <I>has</I> reached you, that the purifying of all the purifiers of the country of Ir&acirc;n is just as they should always perform <I>it</I>. 5. When, as I consider, there is then no complete acquaintance <I>with</I> the management of a house in you, its own master, in what manner then is our account of the gossip&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1336"></A><A HREF="#fn_1331"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, <I>and your</I> information, about all the purifiers of the country of Ir&acirc;n</p>

<p>obtained? 6. If your <I>people</I> should abandon that <I>which is</I> most indispensable, and your account of the gossip, as regards that which the whole realm <I>has</I> done, <I>be</I> not according to the commands of religion and to sound wisdom; <I>and</I> if it has not come completely to your knowledge as the washing of the purifiers of the country of Ir&acirc;n--because, when you do not fix the number even of their footsteps&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1337"></A><A HREF="#fn_1332"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <I>it</I> is certain that <I>your</I> understanding of their disposition <I>and</I> virtuous practice is even less--then it was necessary for you to determine the reason that all the purifiers in the country of Ir&acirc;n always wash that way that is declared as improper, with whatever certainty <I>it be</I> uttered <I>or</I> written.</p>
