### CHAPTER LXX.

1\. *As to* the sixty-ninth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: What are these river-beds <span id="fr_790"></span>[3](#fn_787),
and what is the cause of them; whence do they always arise, *and* why is
*there* not a river-bed every-where *and in* every place where *there*
is no mountain?

2\. The reply is this, that any place where a mountain is not
discernible and a river-bed exists *it* is a fissure (a*s*kûpŏ); and it
is declared as clear that, even before the growth of the mountains, when
the earth was all a plain, *by* the shaking of the world the whole world
became rent (zandakŏ) <span id="fr_791"></span>[4](#fn_788). 3. Even

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Frâsîyâ*v* of
Tûr <span id="fr_792"></span>[1](#fn_789) *was* specially mighty by
causing the construction of channels (vi*d*arg) there where *it* is
mountainous, *and* also *in* low-lands <span
id="fr_793"></span>[2](#fn_790), in which there is no mountain, and the
shaking in its creation *was* the formation of great sunken <span
id="fr_794"></span>[3](#fn_791) springs and river-beds. 4. And if it has
been prepared *in, or* if *it be* in a ravine (*s*ikaftŏ) of, the
mountains, the cause, too, of the contraction, thundering, and tearing
of a river, if *its* confinement *be* in the earth, is the resistance
which it *meets* in seeking a passage; and as it is a spring of the
waters of the earth, so also it is in the earth, whose contraction *and*
panting are mighty *and* full of strength. 5. And when *it is* a time
that they would make a constructed channel at the outside of its ravine,
as regards the contraction which is within it, the resistance by which
it is contracted at the outside of the ravine is the ground  <span
id="fr_795"></span>[4](#fn_792).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_787"></span>[213:3](sbe18077.htm#fr_790) There is some
doubt as to whether the word should be read zôgakŏ (comp. Pers. zô*gh*,
'a river'), or zandakŏ (comp. Pers. *z*andah, 'fissured'), but the
meaning is tolerably certain from the context.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[213:4](sbe18077.htm#fr_791) When the evil
spirit rushed into the earth it is said to have shaken, and the
mountains began to grow (see Bd. VIII, 1-5); and at the resurrection it
is expected that the earth will recover its original perfect state of a
level plain (see Bd. XXX, 33).

<span id="fn_789"></span>[214:1](sbe18077.htm#fr_792) Frangrasyan, the
Tûryan, in the Avesta; called Afrâsiyâb in the Shâhnâmah (see Bd. XXXI,
x4). He is often mentioned as constructing canals (see Bd. XX, 17, 34,
XXI, 6), but being a foreign conqueror he was considered as specially
wicked by the Irânians.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[214:2](sbe18077.htm#fr_793) Assuming that
*s*îtân is a miswriting of *s*îpŏân, occasioned by joining two of the
letters, just as harvispŏ, 'all,' is often written harvist.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[214:3](sbe18077.htm#fr_794) Or, perhaps,
'hidden.'

<span id="fn_792"></span>[214:4](sbe18077.htm#fr_795) That is, a
watercourse which is confined by its natural rocky channel in the
mountains, when carried across the plain in a canal, is confined only,
by softer soil.
