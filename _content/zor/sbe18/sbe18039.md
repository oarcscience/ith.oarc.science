### CHAPTER XXXII.

1\. The thirty-first question is that which you ask thus: When he who is
wicked goes to hell, how

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

does he go, *and in* what manner does he go; also, who comes to meet
him, and who leads him <span id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_229) to hell;
also, does any one of the infernal ones (dû*s*ahûîkânŏ) come to meet
him, or how is it? 2. Shall they also inflict punishment upon him, for
the sin which he *has* committed, at once, or is his punishment the same
until the future existence? 3. Also, what is their food in hell, and of
what description are their pain *and* discomfort; *and* is the limit of
hell manifest, or how is it?

4\. The reply is this, that a soul of the wicked, the fourth night after
passing away <span id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_230), *its* account
*being* rendered, rolls head-foremost and totters (kapînê*d*ŏ) from the
*K*inva*d* bridge <span id="fr_232"></span>[3](#fn_231); and
Vîzarâsh <span id="fr_233"></span>[4](#fn_232), the demon, conveys
(nâye*d*ŏ) <span id="fr_234"></span>[5](#fn_233) him cruelly bound
therefrom, and leads him unto hell. 5 And with him are the spirits *and*
demons connected with the sin of that *soul*, watching in many guises,
resembling the very producers of doubt (vîmandâ*d*ârân-i*k*), the
wounders, slayers, destroyers, deadly ones, monsters (dû*s*-gerpâno),
and criminals,

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

those *who* are unseemly, those, too, *who* are diseased *and* polluted,
biters and tearers, noxious creatures, windy stenches, glooms, fiery
stenches, thirsty ones, those of evil habits, disturbers of sleep
(khvâp-khârân), and other special causers of sin and kinds of
perverting, with whom, in worldly semblance, are the spiritual causers
of distress. 6. And proportional *to* the strength *and* power which
*have* become theirs, owing to his sin, they surround him uncomfortably,
and make him experience vexation, even unto the time of the renovation
*of the universe*. 7. And through the leading of Vîzarâsh <span
id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_234) he comes unwillingly unto hell, becomes
a household attendant (khavag-î-mânôî-aîtŏ) of the fiend and evil *one*,
is repentant of the delusion of a desire for fables (vardakîhâ), is a
longer for *getting* away from hell to the world, and *has* a wonderful
desire for good works.

8\. And his food is as 'a sample of those which are among the most
fetid, most putrid, most polluted, and most thoroughly unpleasant; and
*there* is no enjoyment and completeness *in* his eating, but he shall
devour (*g*a*l*â*d*) with a craving which keeps him hungry and thirsty,
due to water *which* is hastily *sipped* <span
id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_235). 9. Owing to that vicious habit *there*
is no satisfaction therefrom, but it increases his haste and the
punishment, rapidity, and tediousness of his anguish.

10\. The locality <span id="fr_237"></span>[3](#fn_236) in hell is not
limited (sâmânîaît)

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

before the resurrection, *and* until the time of the renovation *of the
universe he* is in hell. 11. Also out of his sin is the punishment
connected *with it*, and that punishment comes upon him, from the fiend
*and* spirit of his own sin, in that manner and proportion with which he
*has* harassed and vexed *others* <span id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_237),
and *has* reverenced, praised, and served that which is vile.

12\. And at the time of the renovation, when the fiend perishes, the
souls of the wicked pass into melted metal (ayênŏ) <span
id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_238) *for* three days; and all fiends and
evil thoughts, which are owing to their sin, have anguish effectually,
and are hurried *away* by the cutting and breaking *away* of the
accumulation (ham-dâ*d*akîh) of sin of the wicked souls. 13. And by that
pre-eminent (a*v*artûm) ablution in the melted metal they are thoroughly
purified from guilt and infamy (dastŏ va raspakŏ), and through the
perseverance (khvâparîh) <span id="fr_240"></span>[3](#fn_239) and
mercifulness of the pre-eminent persistent ones they are pardoned, and
become most saintly (môgtûm) pure ones; as it is said in metaphor that
the pure are *of* two kinds, one which is glorious (khvârvatô), *and*
one which is metallic (ayênavatŏ) <span id="fr_241"></span>[4](#fn_240).

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

14\. And after that purification *there* are no demons, no punishment,
*and* no hell as regards the wicked, and their disposal (vîrâstakŏ) also
is just; they become righteous, painless, deathless, fearless, and free
from harm. 15. And with them comes the spirit of the good works which
were done *and* instigated by them in the world, and procures them
pleasure and joy in the degree and proportion of those good works. 16.
But the recompense of a soul of the righteous is a better formation
(vêhdâ*d*îh) and more <span id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_241).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_229"></span>[71:1](sbe18039.htm#fr_230) M14 and J omit the
words from 'also' to 'leads him.'

<span id="fn_230"></span>[71:2](sbe18039.htm#fr_231) The term 'passing
away' is here used with reference to the death of a wicked person,
contrary to the general rule (see Chap. XX, 2).

<span id="fn_231"></span>[71:3](sbe18039.htm#fr_232) See Chap. XX, 3.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[71:4](sbe18039.htm#fr_233) 'Then the fiend,
named Vîzaresha, carries off in bonds the souls of the wicked
Daêva-worshippers who live in sin' (Vend. XIX, 94, trans. D.); see also
Bd. XXVIII, 18, where the name is Vîzarêsh, but it is always Vîzarâsh in
Dd. Here it has been first miswritten in K35, and afterwards corrected,
so that later copyists have read Vîrâsh, as in M14 and J.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[71:5](sbe18039.htm#fr_234) Identifying the
verb with Av. nayêiti of Vend. V, 25, 31; or it may be read vâye*d*ŏ,
and identified with Av. vayêiti of Vend. XV, 17, or Av. vâdhayêiti of
Vend. XIX, 94, without much change of meaning.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[72:1](sbe18039.htm#fr_235) See § 4.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[72:2](sbe18039.htm#fr_236) Referring to the
fact that a person who is both hungry and thirsty cannot quench his
thirst, for more than a few minutes, by drinking water without eating.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[72:3](sbe18039.htm#fr_237) Or, perhaps, 'his
position,' if we read dîvâk-a*s* instead of <span id="page_73">p.
73</span> dîvâkîh, but the former reading would be more of a modern
Persian idiom than a Pahlavi one.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[73:1](sbe18039.htm#fr_238) Or, '*the good*;'
the word is not expressed in the Pahlavi text.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[73:2](sbe18039.htm#fr_239) Bd. XXX, 20 states
that both the righteous and wicked are finally purified by melted metal
which is a torment to the latter, but only like a bath in warm milk to
the former.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[73:3](sbe18039.htm#fr_240) See Chap. XIX, 7 n.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[73:4](sbe18039.htm#fr_241) This is probably a
misapplication of a Pahlavi phrase which contained the word âsnavatô,
'indestructible,' and was the translation of an Avesta passage
containing the words *hv*âthravan*d*, 'brilliant, glorious,' and âsna,'
stony, indestructible, enduring' (often translated 'heavenly'), which
words are sometimes used together, <span id="page_74">p. 74</span> as in
Yas. LIX, 14. As the Pahl. âsnavatô and ayênavatŏ are written alike they
are easily confounded, but that 'metal' is meant here appears from Yas.
L, 9, b, Bd. XXX, 20.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[74:1](sbe18039.htm#fr_242) M14 has 'and the
position of more good works is better, the rank is greater, and the
pleasure and delight more.'
