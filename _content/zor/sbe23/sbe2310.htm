<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The &Acirc;b&acirc;n Ya<I>s</I>t (or Ya<I>s</I>t of the Waters) is devoted to the great goddess of the waters, the celebrated Ardvi S&ucirc;ra An&acirc;hita, the &#7944;&#0957;&#0945;&#8150;&#0964;&#0953;&#0962; of the Greeks. Ardvi S&ucirc;ra An&acirc;hita ('the high, powerful, undefiled') is the heavenly spring from which all waters on the earth flow down; her fountains are on the top of the mythical mountain, the Hukairya, in the star region. Her descent from the heavens is described in &sect;&sect; 85 seq.; it reminds one of the Indian legend of the celestial Ga&#7749;g&acirc;.</p>  
<p>This Ya<I>s</I>t contains much valuable information about the historical legends of Iran, as it enumerates the several heroes who worshipped Ardvi S&ucirc;ra and asked for her help. First of all is Ahura himself (&sect; 16); then came Haoshyangha (&sect;21), Yima (&sect; 25), A<I>z</I>i Dah&acirc;ka (&sect; 29), Thra&ecirc;taona (&sect; 33), Keres&acirc;spa (&sect; 37), Franghrasyan (&sect; 41), Kava Usa (&sect; 45), Husravah (&sect; 49), Tusa (&sect; 53). Va&ecirc;saka's sons (&sect; 57), Vafra Nav&acirc;za (&sect; 61), <I>G</I>&acirc;m&acirc;spa (&sect; 68), Ashavazdah, the son of Pourudh&acirc;kh<I>s</I>ti, and Ashavazdah and Thrita, the sons of S&acirc;yu<I>z</I>dri (&sect; 72), Vistauru (&sect; 76), Y&ocirc;i<I>s</I>ta (&sect; 81); the Hv&ocirc;vas and the Naotaras (&sect; 98), Zarathu<I>s</I>tra (&sect; 103), Kava V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa (&sect; 107), Zairivairi (&sect; 112), Are<I>g</I>a<I>t</I>-aspa and Vandaremaini (&sect; 116).</p>  
<p>This enumeration is interrupted by a description of the descent of Ardvi S&ucirc;ra from the heavens (&sect;&sect; 85-89), and of certain rules for her sacrifice given by herself to Zarathu<I>s</I>tra (&sect;&sect; 90-97). This interruption may have been intentional, as it takes place just when</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">the course of the enumeration brings us to the times of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra and of the institution of the new religion.</p>  
<p>The Ya<I>s</I>t is opened with a laudation of the benefits bestowed by Ardvi S&ucirc;ra (&sect;&sect; 1-16), and it closes with a description of her garments and apparel.</p>  
<p>The first record of the worship of Ardvi S&ucirc;ra is in a cuneiform inscription by Artaxerxes Mnemon (404-361), in which her name is corrupted into Anahata. Artaxerxes Mnemon appears to have been an eager promoter of her worship, as he is said 'to have first erected the statues of Venus-An&acirc;hita (&#7944;&#0966;&#0961;&#0959;&#0948;&#8055;&#0964;&#0951;&#0962;, &#7944;&#0957;&#0945;&#0912;&#0964;&#0953;&#0948;&#0959;&#0962;) in Babylon, Suza, and Ecbatana, and to have taught her worship to the Persians, the Bactrians, and the people of Damas and Sardes' (Clemens Alexandrinus, Protrept. 5, on the authority of Berosus; about 260 B.C.). My friend M. Hal&eacute;vy suggests to me that the detailed and circumstantial description of An&acirc;hita's appearance and costume (in &sect;&sect; 126-131) shows that the writer must have described her from a consecrated type of statuary.</p>  
<p>The principal data of the Greek writers on An&acirc;hita will be found in Windischmann's Essay (Die persische Anahita oder Ana&iuml;tis, 1856). One must be cautious in the use of the Greek sources, as the Greeks, with the eclectic turn of their mind, were inclined to confound under the name of An&acirc;hita all the great female deities of Asia Minor, and her name became a common appellation for the Aphrodites as well as for the Artemides of the East.</FONT></p>
