<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Ti<I>s</I>trya is the leader of the stars against the planets, as stars and planets belong, respectively, to the worlds of Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu (Vend. Introd. IV, 36; Bund. II, 5 seq.).</p>  
<p>This Ya<I>s</I>t is a description of the production of the rain through the agency of the star Ti<I>s</I>trya. It has to struggle against the Da&ecirc;va of Drought, Apaosha, is first overcome and conquers at last. This seems to be a refacimento of the old storm myths, which have been in so far renewed as the role of the hero in the original myth has been transferred to a star. It is to be noticed, however, that Apaosha is not described as a planet.</p>  
<p>Ti<I>s</I>trya is Sirius&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_455"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It presides over the first month of summer (21 June-21 July). This Ya<I>s</I>t appears thus to have been written in a part of Iran where the dog-days must have fallen in July, and the rainy season began in the last days of July, unless the place of Ti<I>s</I>trya in the calendar has been changed at some later period.</p>  
<p>This Ya<I>s</I>t is recited on the days of Ti<I>s</I>trya, Haurvat&acirc;<I>t</I> (as the Genius of Waters), Farvard&icirc;n (as the Fravashis are his allies in the struggle; &sect; 34), and B&acirc;d (the wind; &sect; 32).</p>  
<p>The struggle between Ti<I>s</I>trya and Apaosha is described in the Bundahi<I>s</I> (VII), but it has there a cosmological character: it has not for its object the annual and regular return of the rains after the dog-days, but the production of the seas and lakes in the first ages of the world.</FONT></p>
