#### XII. RASHN YA*S*T.

Rashnu Razi*s*ta, 'the truest True,' is the Genius of Truth: he is one
of the three judges of the departed, with Mithra and Sraosha: he holds
the balance in which the deeds of men are weighed after their death: 'he
makes no unjust balance . . . ., neither for the pious nor yet the
wicked, neither for lords nor yet rulers; as much as a hair's breadth he
will not vary, and he shows no favour <span
id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_777).' He is an offshoot either of Mithra,
the God of Truth and the avenger of lies, or of Ahura Mazda himself, the
all-knowing lord (§ 2 seq.).

This Ya*s*t seems to be an appeal made to Rashnu to come and attend the
performance of the var nîrang or ordeal (see [p. 170](#page_170), note
[3](#fn_787)), of which Rashnu, as the Genius of Truth, was the natural
witness and arbiter (cf. Vend. IV, 54-55 \[154-156\]). As a god of Truth
must know everything and be present everywhere, he is called from
whatever part of the world he may actually be in. This brings about an
enumeration of all the parts of the world, from this earth (§§ 9-22) to
the highest heaven (§ 37), passing through the Albôrz (§§ 23-26), the
star region (§§ 26-32), the moon region (§ 33), and the sun region (§
34; cf. [p. 73](sbe2310.htm#page_73), note [2](sbe2310.htm#fn_359)).

This Ya*s*t is recited on the days of Rashn, Murdâd, Âshtâd, and Zemyâd
(the 18th, 7th, 26th, and 28th of the month).

0\. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced

Ashem Vohû: Holiness is the best of all good . . . .

I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathu*s*tra, one
who hates the Daêvas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto \[Hâvani\],
the holy and master of holiness.

Unto Rashnu Razi*s*ta; unto Ar*s*tâ*t*, who makes the world grow, who
makes the world increase; unto the true-spoken speech, that makes the
world grow <span id="fr_811"></span>[2](#fn_778);

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and
glorification.

Yathâ ahû vairyô: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness . . . .

#### I.

1\. The holy (Zarathu*s*tra) asked him <span
id="fr_812"></span>[1](#fn_779): 'O holy Ahura Mazda! I ask thee; answer
me with words of truth, thou who knowest the truth. Thou art
undeceivable, thou hast an undeceivable understanding; thou art
undeceivable, as thou knowest everything.

'What of the Holy Word is created true? what is created progress-making?
what is fit to discern? what is healthful? what is wise? what is happy
and more powerful to destroy than all other creatures <span
id="fr_813"></span>[2](#fn_780)?

2\. Ahura Mazda answered: 'I will declare that unto thee, O pure, holy
Spitama!

'The most glorious Holy Word (itself), this is what in the Holy Word is
created true, what is created progress making, what is fit to discern,
what is healthful, wise, and happy, what is more powerful to destroy
than all other creatures.'

3\. Ahura Mazda said: 'Bind up a three-twigged baresma against the way
of the sun. \[Address\] unto me, Ahura Mazda, these words: "We invoke,
we bless \[Ahura\] <span id="fr_814"></span>[3](#fn_781); I invoke the
friendship \[of Ahura\] towards this var <span
id="fr_815"></span>[4](#fn_782) prepared, towards the fire and the
baresma, towards the full boiling \[milk <span

the wise <span id="fr_819"></span>[1](#fn_785), along with the kingly
Glory, along with Saoka <span id="fr_820"></span>[2](#fn_786), made by

5\. 'We invoke, we bless Rashnu, the strong; I invoke his friendship
towards this var <span id="fr_821"></span>[3](#fn_787) prepared, towards
the fire and the baresma, towards the full boiling \[milk\], towards the
var of oil and the sap of the plants.

6\. 'Then Rashnu the tall, the strong, will come for help unto thee,
towards this var prepared, towards the fire and the baresma, towards the
full boiling \[milk\], towards the var of oil and the sap of the plants:

'Along with the fiend-smiting Wind, along with the cursing thought of
the wise, along with the kingly Glory, along with Saoka, made by Mazda.

7\. 'O thou, holy Rashnu! O most true Rashnu! most beneficent Rashnu!
most knowing Rashnu! most discerning Rashnu! most fore-knowing Rashnu!
most far-seeing Rashnu! Rashnu, the

Comm. ad XXXI V, 4 a); cf. Vend. IV, 46, 55. According to the Dînkart,
there were thirty-three kinds of var ordeals (Haug, Ardâ Vîrâf, p. 245);
the most common was to pour melted copper upon the breast of the man
whose truth was to be tested: if he went off uninjured, he was

rises aloft, a thousand twigs will shoot forth from that tree; and when
he alights, he will break off the thousand twigs, and he sheds their
seed therefrom. And the bird Chañmrôsh for ever sits in that vicinity;
and his work is this, that he collects that seed which sheds from the
tree of all seeds, which is Ja*d*-bêsh, and conveys it there where
Tishtar seizes the water, so that Tishtar may seize the water with that
seed of all kinds, and may rain it on the world with the rain'
