She is also called Drv&acirc;spa and Go<I>s</I>&ucirc;r&ucirc;n: Drv&acirc;spa means 'she who keeps horses in health,' and is nothing more than an epithet of G&ocirc;<I>s</I>: G&ocirc;<I>s</I>&ucirc;r&ucirc;n (from the Zend G<I>e</I>u<I>s</I> urvan) means 'the Soul of the Bull' (the primeval Bull). Although urvan is a masculine noun in Zend, yet G&ocirc;<I>s</I>&ucirc;r&ucirc;n is considered a female angel, as this name is only a substitute for G&ocirc;<I>s</I>.</p>  
<p>G&ocirc;<I>s</I> is the angel of the 14th day (S&icirc;r&ocirc;zah I, 14), and her Ya<I>s</I>t is recited during the G&acirc;h U<I>s</I>ahin, on the days of G&ocirc;<I>s</I>, Bahman, M&acirc;h, and R&acirc;m (the same days as those on which the M&acirc;h Ya<I>s</I>t is recited; see above, <A HREF="sbe2312.htm#page_88">p. 88</A>).</p>  
<p>G&ocirc;<I>s</I> is hardly described in this Ya<I>s</I>t (&sect;&sect; 1-2); the greater part of it being filled with the several prayers addressed to her by the Iranian heroes, Haoshyangha (&sect; 3), Yima (&sect; 8), Thra&ecirc;taona (&sect; 13), Haoma (&sect; 17), Husravah (&sect; 21), Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, and V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa. Her worshippers and their prayers to her are the same as in the case of Ashi Vanguhi (see Yt. XVII).</FONT></p>

Aghra&ecirc;ratha (Aghr&ecirc;rath) was a brother of Afr&acirc;sy&acirc;b's; he was a righteous man, and Afr&acirc;sy&acirc;b killed him for his having saved the Iranian king Mino<I>k</I>ihr with his army, when captive in the Padashkhv&acirc;r mountains (Bundahi<I>s</I> XXXI, 21). Yet he is still living as an immortal in the land of Saukavast&acirc;n, under the name of G&ocirc;patsh&acirc;h (the king of the bulls); 'from foot to mid-body he is a bull, and from mid-body to <A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A> the top he is a man; at all times he stays on the sea-shore, and always performs the worship of God, and always pours holy-water into the sea' (Minokhired LXII, 31 seq., tr. West; Bund. XXIX, 5); according to Bund. XXXI, 20, Aghr&ecirc;rath was not G&ocirc;patsh&acirc;h, he was his father. Cf. Yt. XIX, 93.</P>

Marcellinus XVII, 5). The name of the Varedhakas reminds one of the Vertae who are mentioned once in company with the Chionitae (ibid. XIX, 1); but their geographical situation is not ascertained. In any case the proximity of the D&acirc;itya (&sect; 29) shows that both people must have inhabited the western coast of the Caspian sea.</P>
