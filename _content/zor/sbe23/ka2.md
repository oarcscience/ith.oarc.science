      (Translated by James Darmesteter (From Sacred Books of the
      East, American Edition, 1898.)

    0. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! May Angra Mainyu be destroyed
       by those who do truly what is the foremost wish (of God).  
       I praise well-thought, well-spoken, and well-done thoughts, words,
       and deeds. I embrace all good thoughts, good words, and good deeds;
       I reject all evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.  
       I give sacrifice and prayer unto you, O Amesha-Spentas! even with
       the fullness of my thoughts, of my words, of my deeds, and of
       my heart: I give unto you even my own life.  
       I recite the 'Praise of Holiness:'  
       'Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good. Well is it for
       it, well is it for that holiness which is perfection of holiness!'

       I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathushtra,
       one who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura;
       For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto [Havani],
       the holy and master of holiness;  
       For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto [Savanghi
       and Visya], the holy and masters of holiness;
       For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto the
       Masters of the days, of the periods of the day, of the months,
       of the seasons, and of the years;  
       Unto AHURA MAZDA, bright and glorious, be propitiation, with sacrifice,
       prayer, propitiation, and glorification.  
       Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness:
       the riches of Vohu-Mano shall he given to him who works in this
       world for Mazda, and wields according to the will of Ahura the
       power he gave him to relieve the poor.
    1. Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
       Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!  
       'What of the Holy Word is the strongest? What is the most victorious?
       What is the most glorious? What is the most effective?
    2. 'What is the most fiend-smiting? What is the best-healing?
       What destroyeth best the malice of Daevas and Men? What maketh
       the material world best come to the fulfillment of its wishes?
       What freeth the material world best from the anxieties of the
       heart?'
    3. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Our Name, O Spitama Zarathushtra! who
       are the Amesha-Spentas, that is the strongest part of the Holy
       Word; that is the most victorious; that is the most glorious;
       that is the most effective;
    4. 'That is the most fiend-smiting; that is the best-healing;
       that destroyeth best the malice of Daevas and Men: that maketh
       the material world best come to the fulfillment of its wishes;
       that freeth the material World best from the anxieties of the
       heart.'
    5. Then Zarathushtra said: 'Reveal unto me that name of thine,
       O Ahura Mazda! that is the greatest, the best, the fairest, the
       most effective, the most fiend-smiting, the best-healing, that
       destroyeth best the malice of Daevas and Men;
    6. 'That I may afflict all Daevas and Men; that I may afflict
       all Yatus and Pairikas; that neither Daevas nor Men may be able
       to afflict me; neither Yatus nor Pairikas.'
    7. Ahura Mazda replied unto him: 'My name is the One of whom
       questions are asked, O holy Zarathushtra!
       'My second name is the Herd-giver
       'My third name is the Strong One
       'My fourth name is Perfect Holiness.
       'My fifth name is All good things created by Mazda, the offspring
       of the holy principle.  
       'My sixth name is Understanding;  
       'My seventh name is the One with understanding.  
       'My eighth name is Knowledge;  
       'My ninth name is the One with Knowledge.
    8. 'My tenth name is Weal;  
       'My eleventh name is He who produces weal.  
       'My twelfth name is AHURA (the Lord).  
       'My thirteenth name is the most Beneficent.  
       'My fourteenth name is He in whom there is no harm.  
       'My fifteenth name is the unconquerable One.  
       'My sixteenth name is He who makes the true account.  
       'My seventeenth name is the All-seeing One.  
       'My eighteenth name is the healing One.  
       'My nineteenth name is the Creator.  
       'My twentieth name is MAZDA (the All-knowing One).
    9. Worship me, O Zarathushtra, by day and by night, with offerings
       of libations well accepted I will come unto thee for help and
       joy, I, Ahura Mazda; the good, holy Sraosha will come unto thee
       for help and joy; the waters, the plants, and the Fravashis of
       the holy ones will come unto thee for help and joy.
    10. 'If thou wantest, O Zarathushtra, to destroy the malice of
       Daevas and Men, of the Yatus and Pairikas, of the oppressors,
       of the blind and of the deaf, of the two-legged ruffians, of the
       two-legged Ashemaoghas, of the four-legged wolves;
    11. 'And of the hordes with the wide front, with the many spears,
       with the straight spears, with the spears uplifted, bearing the
       spear of havock; then, recite thou these my names every day and
       every night.
    12. 'I am the Keeper; I am the Creator and the Maintainer; I am
       the Discerner; I am the most beneficent Spirit.  
       'My name is the bestower of health; my name is the best bestower
       of health.  
       'My name is the Athravan; my name is the most Athravan-like of
       all Athravans.  
       'My name is Ahura (the Lord)  
       'My name is Mazdau (the all-knowing).  
       'My name is the Holy; my name is the most Holy.  
       'My name is the Glorious; my name is the most Glorious.  
       'My name is the Full-seeing; my name is the Fullest-seeing.  
       'My name is the Far-seeing; my name is the Farthest-seeing.
    13. 'My name is the Protector; my name is the Well-wisher; my
       name is the Creator; my name is the Keeper; my name is the Maintainer.
       'My name is the Discerner; my name is the Best Discerner.  
       'My name is the Prosperity-producer; my name is the Word of Prosperity.
       'My name is the King who rules at his will; my name is the King
       who rules most at his will.  
       'My name is the liberal King; my name is the most liberal King.
    14. 'My name is He who does not deceive; my name is He who is
       not deceived.  
       'My name is the good Keeper; my name is He who destroys malice;
       my name is He Who conquers at once; my name is He who conquers
       everything; my name is He who has shaped everything.  
       'My name is All weal; my name is full weal; my name is the Master
       of weal.
    15. 'My name is He who can benefit at his wish; my name is He
       who can best benefit at his wish.  
       'My name is the Beneficent One; my name is the Energetic One;
       my name is the most Beneficent.  
       'My name is Holiness; my name is the Great One; my name is the
       good Sovereign; my name is the Best of Sovereigns.  
       'My name is the Wise One; my name is the Wisest of the Wise; my
       name is He who does good for a long time.
    16. 'These are my names.
       'And he who in this material world, O Spitama Zarathushtra! shall
       recite and pronounce those names of mine either by day or by night;
    17. 'He who shall pronounce them, when he rises up or when he
       lays him down; when he lays him down or when he rises up; when
       he binds on the sacred girdle or when he unbinds the sacred girdle;
       when he goes out of his dwelling-place, or when he goes out of
       his town, or when he goes out of his country and comes into another
       country:
    18. 'That man, neither in that day nor in that night, shall be
       wounded by the weapons of the foe who rushes Aeshma-like and is
       Druj-minded; not the knife, not the cross-bow, not the arrow,
       not the sword, not the club, not the sling-stone shall reach and
       wound him.
    19. 'But those names shall come in to keep him from behind and
       to keep him in front, from the Druj unseen, from the female Varenya
       fiend, from the evil-doer bent on mischief, and from that fiend
       who is all death, Angra Mainyu. It will be as if there were a
       thousand men watching over one man.
    20. '"Who is he who will smite the fiend in order to maintain
       thy ordinances? Teach me clearly thy rules for this world and
       for the next, that Sraosha may come with Vohu-Mano and help whomsoever
       thou pleasest."
    21. 'Hail to the Glory of the Kavis! Hail to the Airyanem Vaejah!
       Hail to the Saoka, made by Mazda! Hail to the waters of the Daitya!
       Hail to Ardvi, the undefiled well! Hail to the whole world of
       the holy Spirit!  
       'Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord...  
       'Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....
    22. 'We worship the Ahuna Vairya. We worship Asha-Vahishta, most
       fair, undying, and beneficent. We worship Strength and Prosperity
       and Might and Victory and Glory and Vigour. We worship Ahura Mazda,
       bright and glorious.  
       'Yenghe hatam: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda knows the
       goodness for a sacrifice [performed] in holiness, all those beings,
       males and females, do we worship.
    23. 'Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....
       I bless the sacrifice and the prayer unto Ahura Mazda, bright
       and glorious, and his strength and vigour.'


       (Bahman Yasht.)
    24. 'O Zarathushtra! keep thou for ever that man who is friendly
       [to me] from the foe unfriendly [to me]! Do not give up that friend
       unto the stroke (of the foe), unto vexations to be borne; wish
       no harm unto that man who would offer me a sacrifice, be it ever
       so great or ever so small, if it has reached unto us, the Amesha-Spentas.
    25. 'Here is Vohu-Mano, my creature, O Zarathushtra! here is Asha-Vahishta,
       my creature, O Zarathushtra! here is Khshathra-Vairya, my creature,
       O Zarathushtra! here is Spenta-Armaiti, my creature, O Zarathushtra!
       here are Haurvatat and Ameretat, who are the reward of the holy
       ones, when freed from their bodies, my creatures, O Zarathushtra!
    26. 'Thou knowest this, and how it is, O holy Zarathushtra! from
       my understanding and from my knowledge; namely, how the world
       first began, and how it will end.  
       'A thousand remedies, ten thousand remedies!  
       'A thousand remedies, ten thousand remedies!  
       'A thousand remedies, ten thousand remedies!
    27. '[We worship] the well-shapen, tall-formed Strength; Verethraghna,
       made by Ahura; the crushing Ascendant, and Spenta-Armaiti.
    28. 'And with the help of Spenta-Armaiti, break ye asunder their
       malice, turn their minds astray, bind their hands, make their
       knees quake against one another, bind their tongues.  
       'When, O Mazda! shall the faithful smite the wicked? When shall
       the faithful smite the Druj? When shall the faithful smite the
       wicked?'
    29. Then Zarathushtra said: 'I threw you back into the earth,
       and by the eyes of Spenta-Armaiti the ruffian was made powerless.
    30. 'We worship the powerful Gaokerena, made by Mazda; the powerful
       Gaokerena, made by Mazda.
    31. 'We worship the memory of Ahura Mazda to keep the Holy Word.
       We worship the understanding of Ahura Mazda, to study the Holy
       Word.  
       'We worship the tongue of Ahura Mazda, to speak forth the Holy
       Word.  
       'We worship the mountain that gives understanding, that preserves
       understanding; [we worship it] by day and by night, with offerings
       of libations well-accepted.
    32. 'We worship that creation [of Ahura's], Spenta-Armaiti; and
       the holy creations of that creature and of Asha [Vahishta], that
       are foremost in holiness.  
       'Here I take as lord and master the greatest of all, Ahura Mazda;
       to smite the fiend Angra Mainyu; to smite Aeshma of the wounding
       spear; to smite the Mazainya fiends; to smite all the Daevas and
       the Varenya fiends; to increase Ahura Mazda, bright and glorious;
       to increase the Amesha-Spentas; to increase the star Tishtrya,
       the bright and glorious; to increase the faithful men; to increase
       all the holy creatures of the beneficent Spirit.  
       'Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....

    33.    Bestow on him riches... (Recite SrB5.)
       'Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....'

      3. Ardwahisht Yasht
      -------------------
    0.  May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! ....
    Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....
    I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of
    Zarathushtra, one who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of
    Ahura;
    For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto
    [Havani], the holy and master of holiness....
    Unto Asha-Vahishta, the fairest; unto the much-desired
    Airyaman, made by Mazda, and unto the good Saoka, with eyes of
    love, made by Mazda and holy;
    Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and
    glorification.
    Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of
    holiness....


                I.
    1.  Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathushtra, saying: 'That
    thou mayest increase Asha-Vahishta, O Spitama Zarathushtra! with
    hymns of praise, with performance of the office, with
    invocations, holy words, sacrifice, blessings, and adoration -
    once to abide in the shining luminous space, in the beautiful
    abodes - for the sacrifice and invocation of us, the
    Amesha-Spentas'....

    2.  Zarathushtra said: 'Say unto me the right words, such as
    they are, O Ahura Mazda! that I may increase Asha-Vahishta, with
    hymns of praise, with performance of the office, with
    invocations, holy words, sacrifice, blessings, and adoration, -
    once to abide in the shining luminous space, in the beautiful
    abodes, - for the sacrifice and invocation of you, the
    Amesha-Spentas.

    3.  '.... I proclaim Asha-Vahishta: if I proclaim Asha-Vahishta,
    then easy is the way to the abode of the other Amesha-Spentas,
    which Ahura Mazda keeps with Good Thoughts, which Ahura Mazda
    keep with Good Words, which Ahura Mazda keeps with Good Deeds;

    4.  '(Easy is the way to the Garo-nmana of Ahura Mazda): the
    Garo-nmana is for the holy souls, and no one of the wicked can
    enter the Garo-nmana and its bright, wide, holy ways; (no one of
    them can go) to Ahura Mazda.

                II.
    5.  'The Airyaman prayer smites down the strength of all the
    creatures of Angra Mainyu, of the Yatus and Pairikas.  It is the
    greatest of spells, the best of spells, the very best of all
    spells; the fairest of spells, the very fairest of all spells;
    the fearful one amongst spells, the most fearful of all spells;
    the firm one amongst spells, the firmest of all spells; the
    victorious one amongst spells, the most victorious of all spells;
    the healing one amongst spells, the best-healing of all spells.

    6.  'One may heal with Holiness, one may heal with the Law, one
    may heal with the knife, one may heal with herbs, one may heal

    0.  May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced! ....
    Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....
    I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of
    Zarathushtra, one who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of
    Ahura;
    For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto
    [Havani], the holy and master of holiness....

    Unto Haurvatat, the master; unto the prosperity of the
    seasons and unto the years, the masters of holiness,
    Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and
    glorification.
    Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of
    holiness....
    We sacrifice unto Haurvatat, the Amesha-Spenta; we sacrifice
    unto the prosperity of the seasons; we sacrifice unto the years,
    the holy and masters of holiness.

    1.  Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathushtra, saying: 'I
    created for the faithful the help, the enjoyments, the comforts,
    and the pleasures of Haurvatat.  We unite them with him who would
    come up to thee as one of the Amesha-Spentas, as he would come to
    any of the Amesha-Spentas, Vohu-Mano, Asha-Vahishta,
    Khshathra-Vairya, Spenta-Armaiti, Haurvatat, and Ameretat.

    2.  'He who against the thousands of thousands of those Daevas,
    against their ten thousands of ten thousands, against their
    numberless myriads would invoke the name of Haurvatat, as one of
    the Amesha-Spentas, he would smite the Nasu, he would smite
    Hashi, he would smite Bashi, he would smite Saeni, he would
    smite Buji.

    3.  'I proclaim the faithful man as the first [of men]; if I
    proclaim the faithful man as the first [of men], then Rashnu
    Razishta, then every heavenly Yazata of male nature in company
    with the Amesha-Spentas will free the faithful man

    4.  'From the Nasu, from Hashi, from Gashi, from Saeni, from
    Buji; from the hordes with the wide front, from the hordes with
    the many spears uplifted, from the evil man who oppresses, from
    the willful sinner, from the oppressor of men, from the Yatu,
    from the Pairika, from the straying way.

    5.  'How does the way of the faithful turn and part from the way
    of the wicked?'
    Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is when a man pronouncing my
    spell, either reading or reciting it by heart, draws the furrows
    and hides there himself, [saying]:

    6.  '"I will smite thee, O Druj! whomsoever thou art, whomsoever
    thou art amongst the Drujes that come in an open way, whomsoever
    thou art amongst the Drujes that come by hidden way, whomsoever
    thou art amongst the Drujes that defile by contact; whatsoever
    Druj thou art, I smite thee away from the Aryan countries;
    whatsoever Druj thou art, I bind thee; I smite thee down, O Druj!
    I throw thee down below, O Druj!"

    7.  'He draws [then] three furrows: I proclaim him one of the
    faithful; he draws six furrow: I proclaim him one of the
    faithful; he draws nine furrows: I proclaim him one of the
    faithful.

    8.  'The names of those (Amesha-Spentas) smite the men turned to
    Nasus by the Drujes: the seed and kin of the deaf are smitten,
    the scornful are dead, as the Zaotar Zarathushtra blows them
    away to woe, however fierce, at his will and wish, as many as he
    wishes.

    9.  'From the time when the sun is down he smites them with
    bruising blows; from the time when the sun is no longer up, he
    deals deadly blows on the Nasu with his club struck down, for the
    propitiation and glorification of the heavenly gods.

    10.  'O Zarathushtra! let not that spell be shown to any one,
    except by the father to his son, or by the brother to his brother
    from the same womb, or by the Athravan to his pupil in black
    hair, devoted to the good law, who, devoted to the good law,
    holy and brave, stills all the Drujes.

    11.  'For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a
    sacrifice worth being heard, namely, unto Haurvatat, the
    Amesha-Spenta. Unto Haurvatat, the Amesha-Spenta, we offer up the
    libations, the Haoma and meat, the baresma, the wisdom of the
    tongue, the holy spells, the speech, the deeds, the libations,
    and the rightly-spoken words.
    12.
      'Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of
    holiness....
    'I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and
    vigour of Haurvatat, the master; of the prosperity of the seasons
    and of the years, the masters of holiness.

    '[Give] unto that man brightness and glory, .... give him
    the bright, all happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.'

    East, American Edition, 1898.)

    0. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced!....  
    Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....  
    I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathushtra,
    one who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura;  
    For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto [Havani],
    the holy and master of holiness....  
    Unto the good Waters, made by Mazda; unto the holy water-spring
    ARDVI ANAHITA; unto all waters, made by Mazda; unto all plants,
    made by Mazda,  
    Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.
      
    Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....


                I.
    1. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathushtra, saying: 'Offer
    up a sacrifice, O Spitama Zarathushtra! unto this spring of mine,
    Ardvi Sura Anahita, the wide-expanding and health-giving, who
    hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura, who is worthy of
    sacrifice in the material world, worthy of prayer in the material
    world; the life-increasing and holy, the herd-increasing and holy,
    the fold-increasing and holy, the wealth-increasing and holy,
    the country-increasing and holy;
    2.
      'Who makes the seed of all males pure, who makes the womb
    of all females pure for bringing forth, who makes all females
    bring forth in safety, who puts milk into the breasts of all females
    in the right measure and the right quality;
    3. 'The large river, known afar, that is as large as the whole
    of the waters that run along the earth; that runs powerfully from
    the height Hukairya down to the sea Vouru-Kasha.
    4. 'All the shores of the sea Vouru-Kasha are boiling over, all
    the middle of it is boiling over, when she runs down there, when
    she streams down there, she, Ardvi Sura Anahita, who has a thousand
    cells and a thousand channels: the extent of each of those cells,
    of each of those channels is as much as a man can ride in forty
    days, riding on a good horse.
    5. 'From this river of mine alone flow all the waters that spread
    all over the seven Karshvares; this river of mine alone goes on
    bringing waters, both in summer and in winter. This river of mine
    purifies the seed in males, the womb in females the milk in females'
    breasts.
    6. 'I, Ahura Mazda, brought it down with mighty vigor, for the
    increase of the house, of the borough of the town, of the country,
    to keep them, to maintain them, to look over them, to keep and
    maintain them close.
    7. 'Then Ardvi Sura Anahita, O Spitama Zarathushtra! proceeded
    forth from the Maker Mazda. Beautiful were her white arms, thick
    as a horse's shoulder or still thicker; beautiful was her ....,
    and thus came she, strong, with thick arms, thinking thus in her
    heart:
    8. '"Who will praise me? Who will offer me a sacrifice,
    with libations cleanly prepared and well-strained, together with
    the Haoma and meat? To whom shall I cleave, who cleaves unto me,
    and thinks with me, and bestows gifts upon me, and is of good
    will unto me?"
    9. 'For her brightness and glory, I will offer her a sacrifice
    worth being heard; I will offer up unto the holy Ardvi Sura Anahita
    a good sacrifice with an offering of libations;- thus mayest thou
    advise us when thou art appealed to! Mayest thou be most fully
    worshipped, O Ardvi Sura Anahita! with the Haoma and meat, with
    the baresma, with the wisdom of the tongue, with the holy spells,
    with the words with the deeds, with the libations, and with the
    rightly-spoken words.  
    'Yenhe hatam: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda....

    who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura, who is worthy
    of sacrifice in the material world, worthy of prayer in the material
    world; the life-increasing and holy, the herd-increasing and holy,
    the fold-increasing and holy, the wealth-increasing and holy,
    the country-increasing and holy;
    11. 'Who drives forwards on her chariot, holding the reins of
    the chariot. She goes, driving, on this chariot, longing for men
    and thinking thus in her heart: "Who will praise me? Who
    will offer me a sacrifice, with libations cleanly prepared and
    well-strained, together with the Haoma and meat? To whom shall
    I cleave, who cleaves unto me, and thinks with me, and bestows
    gifts unto me, and is of good will unto me?"

    being heard....

    For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto [Havani],
    the holy and master of holiness....
    Unto the undying, shining, swift-horsed Sun;
    Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

    Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....
    1. We sacrifice unto the undying, shining, swift-horsed Sun.

    When the light of the sun waxes warmer, when the brightness of
    the sun waxes warmer, then up stand the heavenly Yazatas, by hundreds
    and thousands: they gather together its Glory, they make its Glory
    pass down, they pour its Glory upon the earth made by Ahura, for
    the increase of the world of holiness, for the increase of the
    creatures of holiness, for the increase of the undying, shining,
    swift-horsed Sun.
    2. And when the sun rises up, then the earth, made by Ahura,
    becomes clean; the running waters become clean, the waters of
    the wells become clean, the waters of the sea become clean, the
    standing waters become clean; all the holy creatures, the creatures
    of the Good Spirit, become clean.
    3. Should not the sun rise up, then the Daevas would destroy
    all the things that are in the seven Karshvares, nor would the
    heavenly Yazatas find any way of withstanding or repelling them
    in the material world.
    4. He who offers up a sacrifice unto the undying, shining, swift-horsed
    Sun - to withstand darkness, to withstand the Daevas born of darkness,
    to withstand the robbers and bandits, to withstand the Yatus and
    Pairikas, to withstand death that creeps in unseen - offers it
    up to Ahura Mazda, offers it up to the Amesha-Spentas, offers
    it up to his own soul. He rejoices all the heavenly and worldly
    Yazatas, who offers up a sacrifice unto the undying, shining,
    swift-horsed Sun.
    5. I will sacrifice unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, who
    has a thousand ears, ten thousand eyes.
    I will sacrifice unto the club of Mithra, the lord of wide pastures,
    well struck down upon the skulls of the Daevas.
    I will sacrifice unto that friendship, the best of all friendships,
    that reigns between the moon and the sun.
    6. For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice
    worth being heard, namely, unto the undying, shining, swift-horsed
    Sun. Unto the undying, shining, swift-horsed Sun we offer up the
    libations, the Haoma and meat, the baresma, the wisdom of the
    tongue, the holy spells, the speech, the deeds, the libations,
    and the rightly-spoken words.
    Yenghe hatam: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda....
    7. Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....

    I bless the sacrifice and the invocation, and the strength and
    vigour of the undying, shining, swift-horsed Sun.

    Give unto that man brightness and glory, give him health of body,
    .... give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy
    Ones.

    2. How does the moon wax? How does the moon wane?
    For fifteen days does the moon wax; for fifteen days does the
    moon wane. As long as her waxing, so long is the waning; as long
    as her waning, so long is the waxing.
    'Who is there but thee who makes the moon wax and wane?'
    3. We sacrifice unto the Moon that keeps in it the seed of the
    Bull, the holy and master of holiness.
    Here I look at the moon, here I perceive the moon; here I look
    at the light of the moon, here I perceive the light of the moon.
    The Amesha-Spentas stand up holding its glory; the Amesha-Spentas
    stand up, pouring its glory upon the earth, made by Mazda.
    4. And when the light of the moon waxes warmer, golden-hued plants
    grow on from the earth during the spring.
    We sacrifice unto the new moons, the full moons, and the Vishaptathas.
    We sacrifice unto the new moon, the holy and master of holiness;
    We sacrifice unto the full moon, the holy and master of holiness;
    We sacrifice unto the Vishaptatha, the holy and master of holiness.
    5. I will sacrifice unto the Moon, that keeps in it the seed
    of the Bull, the liberal, bright, glorious, water-giving, warmth-giving,
    wisdom-giving, wealth-giving, riches-giving, thoughtfulness-giving,
    weal-giving, freshness-giving, prosperity-giving, the liberal,
    the healing.
    6. For its brightness and glory, I will offer unto it a sacrifice
    worth being heard, namely, unto the Moon that keeps in it the
    seed of the Bull.
    Unto the Moon that keeps in it the seed of the Bull, we offer
    up the libations, the Haoma and meat, the baresma, the wisdom
    of the tongue, the holy spells, the speech, the deeds, the libations,
    and the rightly-spoken words.
    Yenghe hatam: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda....
    7. Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....

    I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour
    of the Moon, that keeps in it the seed of the Bull, and of the
    only-created Bull, and of the Bull of many species.
    Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good.
    Give unto that man brightness and glory, give him health of body,
    .... give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the holy
    Ones.

    I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathushtra,
    one who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura;
    For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto [Havani],
    the holy and master of holiness....

    1. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathushtra, saying: 'We worship
    the lordship and mastership [of Tishtrya], whereby he protects
    the Moon, the dwelling, the food, when my glorious stars come
    along and impart their gifts to men. I will sacrifice unto the
    star Tishtrya, that gives the fields their share [of waters].
    2. 'We offer up libations unto Tishtrya, the bright and glorious
    star, that gives happy dwelling and good dwelling; the white,

    shape of worm-stars, fly between the earth and the heavens, in
    the sea Vouru-Kasha, the powerful sea, the large-sized, deep sea
    of salt waters. He goes to its lake in the shape of a horse, in
    a holy shape; and down there he makes the waters boil over, and

    shape of a man of fifteen years of age, bright, with clear eyes,
    tall, full of strength, strong, and clever.
    14. 'He is active as the first man was; he goes on with the strength
    of the first man; he has the virility of the first man.
    15. 'Here he calls for people to assemble, here he asks, saying:
    "Who now will offer me the libations with the Haoma and the
    holy meat? To whom shall I give wealth of male children, a troop
    of male children, and the purification of his own soul? Now I
    ought to receive sacrifice and prayer in the material world, by
    the law of excellent holiness."
    16. 'The next ten nights, O Spitama Zarathushtra! the bright and

    shape of a golden-horned bull.
    17. 'Here he calls for people to assemble, here he asks, saying:
    "Who now will offer me the libations with the Haoma and the
    holy meat? To whom shall I give wealth of oxen, a herd of oxen,

    and prayer in the material world, by the law of excellent holiness."
    18. 'The next ten nights, O Spitama Zarathushtra! the bright and

    shape of a white, beautiful horse, with golden ears and a golden
    caparison.
    19. 'Here he calls for people to assemble, here he asks, saying:

    20. 'Then, O Spitama Zarathushtra! the bright and glorious Tishtrya
    goes down to the sea Vouru-Kasha in the shape of a white, beautiful
    horse, with golden ears and a golden caparison.
    21. 'But there rushes down to meet him the Daeva Apaosha, in the
    shape of a dark horse, black with black ears, black with a black
    back, black with a black tail, stamped with brands of terror.
    22. 'They meet together, hoof against hoof, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
    the bright and glorious Tishtrya and the Daeva Apaosha. They fight
    together, O Spitama Zarathushtra! for three days and three nights.
    And then the Daeva Apaosha proves stronger than the bright and
    glorious Tishtrya, he overcomes him.
    23. 'And Tishtrya flees from the sea Vouru-Kasha, as far as a
    Hathra's length. He cries out in woe and distress, the bright
    and glorious Tishtrya: "Woe is me, O Ahura Mazda! I am in
    distress, O Waters and Plants! O Fate and thou, Law of the worshippers
    of Mazda! Men do not worship me with a sacrifice in which I am
    invoked by my own name, as they worship the other Yazatas with
    sacrifices in which they are invoked by their own names.
    24. '"If men had worshipped me with a sacrifice in which
    I had been invoked by my own name, as they worship the other Yazatas
    with sacrifices in which they are invoked by their own names,
    I should have taken to me the strength of ten horses, the strength
    of ten camels, the strength of ten bulls, the strength of ten
    mountains, the strength of ten rivers."
    25. 'Then I, Ahura Mazda, offer up to the bright and glorious
    Tishtrya a sacrifice in which he is invoked by his own name, and
    I bring him the strength of ten horses, the strength of ten camels,
    the strength of ten bulls, the strength of ten mountains, the
    strength of ten rivers.
    26. 'Then, O Spitama Zarathushtra! the bright and glorious Tishtrya
    goes down to the sea Vouru-Kasha in the shape of a white, beautiful
    horse, with golden ears and golden caparison.
    27. 'But there rushes down to meet him the Daeva Apaosha in the
    shape of a dark horse, black with black ears, black with a black
    back, black with a black tail, stamped with brands of terror.
    28. 'They meet together, hoof against hoof, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
    the bright and glorious Tishtrya, and the Daeva Apaosha; they
    fight together, O Zarathushtra! till the time of noon. Then the
    bright and glorious Tishtrya proves stronger than the Daeva Apaosha,
    he overcomes him.
    29. 'Then he goes from the sea Vouru-Kasha as far as a Hathra's
    length: "Hail!" cries the bright and glorious Tishtrya.
    "Hail unto me, O Ahura Mazda! Hail unto you, O waters and
    plants! Hail, O Law of the worshippers of Mazda! Hail will it
    be unto you, O lands! The life of the waters will flow down unrestrained
    to the big-seeded corn fields, to the small-seeded pasture-fields,
    and to the whole of the material world!"
    30. Then the bright and glorious Tishtrya goes back down to the
    sea Vouru-Kasha, in the shape of a white, beautiful horse, with
    golden ears and a golden caparison.
    31. 'He makes the sea boil up and down; he makes the sea stream
    this and that way; he makes the sea flow this and that way: all
    the shores of the sea Vouru-Kasha are boiling over, all the middle
    of it is boiling over.
    32. 'And the bright and glorious Tishtrya rises up from the sea
    Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathushtra! the bright and glorious Satavaesa
    rises up from the sea Vouru-Kasha; and vapours rise up above Mount
    Us-hindu, that stands in the middle of the sea Vouru-Kasha.
    33. 'Then the vapours push forward, in the regular shape of clouds;
    they go following the wind, along the ways which Haoma traverses,
    the increaser of the world. Behind him travels the mighty wind,
    made by Mazda, and the rain, and the cloud, and the sleet, down
    to the several places, down to the fields, down to the seven Karshvares
    of the earth.
    34. 'Apam Napat, O Spitama Zarathushtra! divides the waters amongst
    the countries in the material world, in company with the mighty
    wind, the Glory, made by the waters, and the Fravashis of the
    faithful.

    and invocation in honour of the bright and glorious Tishtrya,

    man drink of the libations cleanly prepared, which if he does,
    if he offers them unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, Mithra
    will be pleased with him and without anger.'
    121. Zarathushtra asked him: 'O Ahura Mazda! how shall the faithful
    man drink the libations cleanly prepared, which if he does and
    he offers them unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, Mithra
    will be pleased vvith him and without anger?'
    122. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Let them wash their bodies three days
    and three nights; let them undergo thirty strokes for the sacrifice
    and prayer unto Mithra, the lord of wide pastures. Let them wash
    their bodies two days and two nights; let them undergo twenty
    strokes for the sacrifice and prayer unto Mithra, the lord of
    wide pastures. Let no man drink of these libations who does not
    know the staota yesnya: Vispe ratavo.

      -----------------------
    0. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced!....
    Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....
    I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathushtra,
    one who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura;
    For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto [Havani],
    the holy and master of holiness....
    Unto the holy, strong Sraosha, who is the incarnate Word, a mighty-speared
    and lordly god,
    Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

    Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....


                [[1]]
    1. We sacrifice unto the holy, tall-formed, fiend-smiting Sraosha,
    who makes the world increase, the holy and master of holiness.

    Good prayer, excellent prayer to the worlds, O Zarathushtra!
    2. This it is that takes away the friendship of the fiend and
    fiends, of the he-fiend and of the she-fiend; it turns away in
    giddiness their eyes, minds, ears, hands, feet, mouths, and tongues;
    as good prayer, without deceit and without harm, is Manly Courage,
    and turns away the Druj.
    3. The holy Sraosha, the best protector ofthe poor, is fiend-smiting;
    he is the best smiter of the Druj.
    The faithful one who pronounces most words of blessing is the
    most victorious in victory; the Mathra Spenta takes best the unseen
    Druj way. The Ahuna Vairya is the best fiend-smiter among all
    spells; the word of truth is the fighter that is the best of all
    fiend-smiters.
    The Law of the worshippers of Mazda is the truest giver of all
    the good things of all those that are the offspring of the good
    principle; and so is the Law of Zarathushtra.
    4. And he who should pronounce that word, O Zarathushtra! either
    a man or a woman with a mind all intent on holiness, with words
    all intent on holiness, with deeds all intent on holiness, when
    he is in fear either of high waters or of the darkness of a rainy
    night;
    Or at the fords of a river, or at the branching-off of roads;

    Or in the meeting together of the faithful, or the rushing together
    of the worshippers of the Daevas;
    5. Whether on the road or in the law he has to fear, not in that
    day nor in that night shall the tormenting fiend, who wants to
    torment him, prevail to throw upon him the look of his evil eye,
    and the malice of the thief who carries off cattle shall not reach
    him.
    6. Pronounce then that word, O Zarathushtra! that word to be
    spoken, when thou fall upon the idolaters and thieves and Daevas
    rushing together. Then the malice of the wicked worshippers of
    the Daevas, of the Yatus and their followers, of the Pairikas
    and their followers, will be affrighted and rush away. Down are
    the Daevas! Down are the Daeva-worshippers, and they take back
    their mouths from biting.
    7. And therefore we take around us the holy-natured Sraosha,
    the holy, the fiend-smiter, as one does with shepherds' dogs;
    therefore we sacrifice unto the holy-natured Sraosha, the holy,
    the fiend-smiter, with good thoughts, good words, and good deeds.
    8. For his brightness and glory, for his strength and victorious
    power, for his offering sacrifices unto the gods, I will offer
    him a sacrifice worth being heard. I will offer up libations unto
    the holy Sraosha, unto the great Ashi Vanguhi, and unto Nairyo-sangha,
    the tall-formed.
    So may the holy Sraosha, the fiend-smiter, come to us for help!
    9. We worship the holy Sraosha; we worship the great master,
    Ahura Mazda, who is supreme in holiness, who is the foremost to
    do deeds of holiness.
    We worship all the words of Zarathushtra, and all the good deeds,
    those done and those to be done.
    Yenhe hatam: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda....


                [[2]]
    10. We sacrifice unto the holy, tall-formed fiend-smiting Sraosha,
    who makes the world increase, the holy and master of holiness;
    Who strikes the evil-doing man, who strikes the evil-doing woman;
    who smites the fiendish Druj, and is most strong and world-destroying;
    who maintains and looks over all this moving world;
    11. Who, never sleeping, wakefully guards the creation of Mazda;
    who, never sleeping, wakefully maintains the creation of Mazda;
    who protects all the material world with his club uplifted, from
    the hour when the sun is down;
    12. Who never more did enjoy sleep from the time when the two
    Spirits made the world, namely, the good Spirit and the evil One;
    who every day, every night, fights with the Mazainya Daevas.
    13. He bows not for fear and fright before the Daevas: before
    him all the Daevas bow for fear and fright reluctantly, and rush
    away to darkness.
    For his brightness and glory, for his strength and victorious
    power....


                [[3]]
    14. Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....

    We sacrifice unto the holy, tall-formed, fiend-smiting Sraosha,
    who makes the world increase, the holy and master of holiness;

    Who with peace and friendship watches the Druj and the most beneficent
    Spirit: so that the Amesha-Spentas may go along the seven Karshvares
    of the earth; who is the teacher of the Law: he himself was taught
    it by Ahura Mazda, the holy One.
    For his brightness and glory, for his strength and victorious
    power....


                [[4]]
    15. Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....
    We sacrifice unto the holy, tall-formed, fiend-smiting Sraosha,
    who makes the world increase, the holy and master of holiness;
    Whom the holy Ahura Mazda has created to withstand Aeshma, the
    fiend of the wounding spear; we sacrifice unto Peace, whose breath
    is friendly, and unto the two withstanders of sin and guilt,
    16. The friends of the holy Sraosha;
    The friends of Rashnu Razista;
    The friends of the good Law of the worshippers of Mazda;
    The friends of Arstat, who makes the world grow, who makes the
    world increase, who makes the world prosper;
    The friends of Ashi Vanguhi;
    The friends of the good Chisti;
    The friends of the most right Chista;
    17. The friends of all gods;
    The friends of the Mathra Spenta;
    The friends of the fiend-destrqying Law;
    The friends of the long-traditional teaching;
    The friends of the Amesha-Spentas;
    The friends of ourselves, the Saoshyants, the two-footed part
    of the holy creation;
    The friends of all the beings of the holy world.
    For his brightness and glory, for his strength and victorious
    power....


                [[5]]
    18. Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of tbe Lord is the law of holiness....
    We sacrifice unto the holy, tall-formed, fiend-smiting Sraosha,
    who makes the world increase, the holy and master of holiness;
    The first [Sraosha], the next, the middle, and the highest; with
    the first sacrifice, with the next, with the middle, and with
    the highest. We sacrifice unto all [the moments] of the holy and
    strong Sraosha, who is the incarnate Word;
    19. The strong Sraosha, of the manly courage, the warrior of the
    strong arms, who breaks the skulls of the Daevas; who smites with
    heavy blows and is strong to smite; the holy Sraosha, who smites
    with heavy blows; we sacrifice unto the crushing Ascendant of
    both the holy Sraosha and Arshti.
    20. We sacrifice for all the houses protected by Sraosha, where
    the holy Sraosha is dear and friendly treated and satisfied, as
    well as the faithful man, rich in good thoughts, rich in good
    words, rich in good deeds.
    21. We sacrifice unto the body of the holy Sraosha;
    We sacrifice unto the body of Rashnu Razishta;
    We sacrifice unto the body of Mithra, the lord of wide pastures;
    We sacrifice unto the body of the holy wind;
    We sacrifice unto the body of the good Law of the worshippers
    of Mazda;
    We sacrifice unto the body of Arshtat, who makes the world grow,
    who makes the world increase, who makes the world prosper;
    We sacrifice unto the body of Ashi Vanguhi;
    We sacrifice unto the body of the good Chisti;
    We sacrifice unto the body of the most right Chista;
    We sacrifice unto the bodies of all the gods;
    22. We sacrifice unto the body of the Mathra Spenta;
    We sacrifice unto the body of the fiend-destroying Law;
    We sacrifice unto the body of the long-traditional teaching;
    We sacrifice unto the bodies of the Amesha-Spentas;
    We sacrifice unto the bodies of ourselves, the Saoshyants, the
    two-footed part of the holy creation;

    For his brightness and glory, for his strength and victorious
    power....
    23. Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....
    I bless the sacrifice and prayer, the strength and vigour of the
    holy, strong Sraosha, who is the incarnate Word, a mighty-speared

      13. Frawardin Yasht (Hymn to the Fravashis)
      -------------------------------------------
    0. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced!....
    Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....
    I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathushtra,
    one who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura;
    For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto [Havani],
    the holy and master of holiness.
    Unto the awful, overpowering Fravashis of the faithful; unto the
    Fravashis of the men of the primitive law; unto the Fravashis
    of the next-of-kin,
    Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.

    Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....
    1. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathushtra, saying: 'Do thou
    proclaim, O pure Zarathushtra! the vigour and strength, the glory,
    the help and the joy that are in the Fravashis of the faithful,
    the awful and overpowering Fravashis; do thou tell how they come
    to help me, how they bring assistance unto me, the awful Fravashis
    of the faithful.
    2. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathushtra! I maintain
    that sky, there above, shining and seen afar, and encompassing
    this earth all around.
    3. 'It looks like a palace, that stands built of a heavenly substance,
    firmly established, with ends that lie afar, shining in its body
    of ruby over the three-thirds (of the earth)"; it is like
    a garment inlaid with stars, made of a heavenly substance, that
    Mazda puts on, along with Mithra and Rashnu and Spenta-Armaiti,
    and on no side can the eye perceive the end of it.
    4. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathushtra! I maintain
    Ardvi Sura Anahita, the wide-expanding and health-giving, who
    hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura who is worthy of
    sacrifice in the material world, worthy of prayer in the material
    world, the life-increasing and holy, the flocks-increasing and
    holy, the fold-increasing and holy, the wealth increasing and
    holy, the country increasing and holy;
    5. 'Who makes the seed of all males pure, who makes the womb
    of all females pure for bringing forth, who makes all females
    bring forth in safety, who puts milk in the breasts of all females
    in the right measure and the right quality;
    6. 'The large river, known afar, that is as large as the whole
    of all the waters that run along the earth; that runs powerfully
    from the height Hukairya down to the sea Vouru-kasha.
    7. 'All the shores of the sea Vouru-kasha are boiling over, all
    the middle of it is boiling over, when she runs down there, when
    she streams down there, she, Ardvi Sura Anahita, who has a thousand
    cells and a thousand channels; the extent of each of those cells,
    of each of those channels, is as much as a man can ride in forty
    days, riding on a good horse.
    8. 'From this river of mine alone flow all the waters that spread
    all over the seven Karshvares; this river of mine alone goes on
    bringing waters, both in summer and in winter. This river of mine
    purifies the seed in males, the womb in females, the milk in females'
    breasts.
    9. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathushtra! I maintain
    the wide earth made by Ahura, the large and broad earth, that
    bears so much that is fine, that bears all the bodily world, the
    live and the dead, and the high mountains, rich in pastures and
    waters;
    10. 'Upon which run the many streams and rivers; upon which the
    many kinds of plants grow up from the ground, to nourish animals
    and men, to nourish the Aryan nations, to nourish the five kinds
    of animals, and to help the faithful.
    11. 'Through their brightness and glory, O Zarathushtra! I maintain
    in the womb the child that has been conceived, so that it does
    not die from the assaults of Vidotu, and I develop in it the bones,
    the hair, the ..., the entrails, the feet, and the sexual organs.
    12. 'Had not the awful Fravashis of the faithful given help unto
    me, those animals and men of mine, of which there are such excellent
    kinds, would not subsist; strength would belong to the Druj, the
    dominion would belong to the Druj, the material world would belong
    to the Druj.
    13. 'Between the earth and the sky the immaterial creatures would
    be harassed by the Druj; between the earth and the sky the immaterial
    creatures would be smitten by the Druj; and never afterwards would
    Angra-Mainyu give way to the blows of Spenta-Mainyu.
    14. 'Through their brightness and glory the waters run and flow
    forward from the never-failing springs; through their brightness
    and glory the plants grow up from the earth, by the never-failing
    springs; through their brightness and glory the winds blow, driving
    down the clouds towards the never-failing springs.
    15. 'Through their brightness and glory the females conceive offspring;
    through their brightness and glory they bring forth in safety;
    it is through their brightness and glory when they become blessed
    with children.
    16. 'Through their brightness and glory a man is born who is a
    chief in assemblies and meetings, who listens well to the (holy)
    words, whom Wisdom holds dear, and who returns a victor from discussions
    with Gaotema, the heretic.
    'Through their brightness and glory the sun goes his way; through
    their brightness and glory the moon goes her way; through their
    brightness and glory the stars go their way.
    17. 'In fearful battles they are the wisest for help, the Fravashis
    of the faithful.
    'The most powerful amongst the Fravashis of the faithful, O Spitama!
    are those of the men of the primitive law or those of the Saoshyants
    not yet born, who are to restore the world. Of the others, the
    Fravashis of the living faithful are more powerful, O Zarathushtra!
    than those of the dead, O Spitama!
    18. 'And the man who in life shall treat the Fravashis of the
    faithful well, will become a ruler of the country with full power,
    and a chief most strong; so shall any man of you become, who shall
    treat Mithra well, the lord of wide pastures, and Arshtat, who
    makes the world grow, who makes the world increase.
    19. 'Thus do I proclaim unto thee, O pure Spitama! the vigour
    and strength, the glory, the help, and the joy that are in the
    Fravashis of the faithful, the awful and overpowering Fravashis;
    and how they come to help me, how they bring assistance unto me,
    the awful Fravashis of the faithful.'


                [[2]]
    20. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathushtra, saying: 'If in
    this material world, O Spitama Zarathushtra! thou happenest to
    come upon frightful roads, full of dangers and fears, O Zarathushtra!
    and thou fearest for thyself, then do thou recite these words,
    then proclaim these fiend-smiting words, O Zarathushtra!
    21. '"I praise, I invoke, I meditate upon, and we sacrifice
    unto the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful. We
    worship the Fravashis of the masters of the houses, those of the
    lords of the boroughs, those of the lords of the towns, those
    of the lords of the countries, those of the Zarathustrotemas;
    the Fravashis of those that are, the Fravashis of those that have
    been, the Fravashis of those that will be; all the Fravashis of
    all nations, and most friendly the Fravashis of the friendly nations;
    22. '"Who maintain the sky, who maintain the waters, who
    maintain the earth, who maintain the cattle, who maintain in the
    womb the child that has been conceived, so that it does not die
    from the assaults of Vidotu, and develop in it the bones, the
    hair, the ...., the entrails, the feet, and the sexual organs;
    23. '"Who are much-bringing, who move with awfulness, well-moving,
    swiftly moving, quickly moving, who move when invoked; who are
    to be invoked in the conquest of good, who are to be invoked in
    fights against foes, who are to be invoked in battles;
    24. '"Who give victory to their invoker, who give boons to
    their lover, who give health to the sick man, who give good Glory
    to the faithful man that brings libations and invokes them with
    a sacrifice and words of propitiation,
    25. '"Who turn to that side where are faithful men, most
    devoted to holiness, and where is the greatest piety, where the
    faithful man is rejoiced, and where the faithful man is not ill-treated."'


                [[3]]
    26. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    who are the mightiest of drivers, the lightest of those driving
    forwards, the slowest of the retiring, the safest of all bridges,
    the least-erring of all weapons and arms, and who never turn their
    backs.
    27. At once, wherever they come, we worship them, the good ones,
    the excellent ones, the good, the strong, the beneficent Fravashis
    of the faithful. They are to be invoked when the bundles of baresma
    are tied; they are to be invoked in fights against foes, in battles,
    and there where gallant men strive to conquer foes.
    28. Mazda invoked them for help, when he fixed the sky and the
    waters and the earth and the plants; when Spenta-Mainyu fixed
    the sky, when he fixed the waters, when the earth, when the cattle,
    when the plants, when the child conceived in the womb, so that
    it should not die from the assaults of Vidotu, and developed in
    it the bones, the hair, the ...., the entrails, the feet, and
    the sexual organs.
    29. Spenta-Mainyu maintained the sky, and they sustained it from
    below, they, the strong Fravashis, who sit in silence, gazing
    with sharp looks; whose eyes and ears are powerful, who bring
    long joy, high and high-girded; well-moving and moving afar, loud-snorting,
    possessing riches and a high renown.


                [[4]]
    30. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful;
    whose friendship is good, and who know how to benefit; whose friendship
    lasts long; who like to stay in the abode where they are not harmed
    by its dwellers; who are good, beautiful afar, health-giving,
    of high renown, conquering in battle, and who never do harm first.


                [[5]]
    31. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful;
    whose will is dreadful unto those who vex them; powerfully working
    and most beneficent; who in battle break the dread arms of their
    foes and haters.


                [[6]]
    32. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful;
    liberal, valiant, and full of strength, not to be seized by thought,
    welfare-giving, kind, and health-giving, following with Ashi's
    remedies, as far as the earth extends, as the rivers stretch,
    as the sun rises.


                [[7]]
    33. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    who gallantly and bravely fight, causing havoc, wounding, breaking
    to pieces all the malice of the malicious, Daevas and men, and
    smiting powerfully in battle, at their wish and will.
    34. You kindly deliver the Victory made by Ahura, and the crushing
    Ascendant, most beneficently, to those countries where you, the
    good ones, unharmed and rejoiced, unoppressed and unoffended,
    have been held worthy of sacrifice and prayer, and proceed the
    way of your wish.


                [[8]]
    35. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    of high renown, smiting in battle, most strong, shield-bearing
    and harmless to those who are true, whom both the pursuing and
    the fleeing invoke for help: the pursuer invokes them for a swift
    race, and for a swift race does the fleer invoke them;
    36. Who turn to that side where are faithful men, most devoted
    to holiness, and where is the greatest piety, where the faithful
    man is rejoiced, and where the faithful man is not ill-treated.


                [[9]]
    37. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    who form many battalions, girded with weapons, lifting up spears,
    and full of sheen; who in fearful battles come rushing along where
    the gallant heroes go and assail the Danus.
    38. There you destroy the victorious strength of the Turanian
    Danus; there you destroy the malice of the Turanian Danus; through
    you the chiefs are of high intellect and most successful; they,
    the gallant heroes, the gallant Saoshyants, the gallant conquerors
    of the offspring of the Danus chiefs of myriads, who wound with
    stones.


                [[10]]
    39. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    who rout the two wings of an army standing in battle array, who
    make the centre swerve, and swiftly pursue onwards, to help the
    faithful and to distress the doers of evil deeds.


                [[11]]
    40. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful;
    awful, overpowering, and victorious, smiting in battle, sorely
    wounding, blowing away (the foes), moving along to and fro, of
    good renown, fair of body, godly of soul, and holy; who give victory
    to their invoker, who give boons to their lover, who give health
    to the sick man;
    41. Who give good glory to him who worships them with a sacrifice,
    as that man did worship them, the holy Zarathushtra, the chief
    of the material world, the head of the two-footed race, in whatever
    struggle he had to enter, in whatever distress he did fear;
    42. Who, when well invoked, enjoy bliss in the heavens; who, when
    well invoked, come forward from the heavens, who are the heads
    of that sky above, possessing the well-shapen Strength, the Victory
    made by Ahura, the crushing Ascendant, and Welfare, the wealth-bringing,
    boon-bringing, holy, well fed, worthy of sacrifice and prayer
    in the perfection of holiness.
    43. They shed Satavaesa between the earth and the sky, him to
    whom the waters belong, who listens to appeals and makes the waters
    flow and the plants grow up, to nourish animals and men, to nourish
    the Aryan nations, to nourish the five kinds of animals and to
    help the faithful.
    44. Satavaesa comes down and flows between the earth and the sky,
    he to whom the waters belong, who listens to appeals and makes
    the waters and the plants grow up, fair, radiant, and full of
    light, to nourish animals and men, to nourish the Aryan nations,
    to nourish the five kinds of animals, and to help the faithful.


                [[12]]
    45. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful;
    with helms of brass, with weapons of brass, with armour of brass;
    who struggle in the fights for victory in garments of light, arraying
    the battles and bringing them forwards, to kill thousands of Daevas.

    When the wind blows from behind them and brings their breath unto
    men,
    46. Then men know where blows the breath of victory: and they
    pay pious homage unto the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of
    the faithful, with their hearts prepared and their arms uplifted.
    47. Whichever side they have been first worshipped in the fulness
    of faith of a devoted heart, to that side turn the awful Fravashis
    of the faithful, along with Mithra and Rashnu and the awful cursing
    thought of the wise and the victorious wind.
    48. And those nations are smitten at one stroke by their fifties
    and their hundreds, by their hundreds and their thousands, by
    their thousands and their tens of thousands, by their tens of
    thousands and their myriads of myriads, against which turn the
    awful Fravashis of the faithful, along with Mithra and Rashnu,
    and the awful cursing thought of the wise and the victorious wind.


                [[13]]
    49. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    who come and go through the borough at the time of the Hamaspathmaidyem;
    they go along there for ten nights, asking thus:
    50. 'Who will praise us? Who will offer us a sacrifice? Who will
    meditate upon us? Who will bless us? Who will receive us with
    meat and clothes in his hand and with a prayer worthy of bliss?
    Of which of us will the name be taken for invocation? Of which
    of you will the soul be worshipped by you with a sacrifice? To
    whom will this gift of ours be given, that he may have never-failing
    food for ever and ever?'
    51. And the man who offers them up a sacrifice, with meat and
    clothes in his hand, with a prayer worthy of bliss, the awful
    Fravashis of the faithful, satisfied, unharmed, and unoffended,
    bless thus:
    52. 'May there be in this house flocks of animals and men! May
    there be a swift horse and a solid chariot! May there be a man
    who knows how to praise God and rule in an assembly, who will
    offer us sacrifices with meat and clothes in his hand, and with
    a prayer worthy of bliss.'


                [[14]]
    53. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    who show beautiful paths to the waters, made by Mazda, which had
    stood before for a long time in the same place without flowing:
    54. And now they flow along the path made by Mazda, along the
    way made by the gods, the watery way appointed to them, at the
    wish of Ahura Mazda, at the wish of the Amesha-Spentas.


                [[15]]
    55. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    who show a beautiful growth to the fertile plants, which had stood
    before for a long time in the same place without growing;
    56. And now they grow up along the path made by Mazda, along the
    way made by the gods, in the time appointed to them, at the wish
    of Ahura Mazda, at the wish of the Amesha-Spentas.


                [[16]]
    57. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    who showed their paths to the stars, the moon, the sun, and the
    endless lights, that had stood before for a long time in the same
    place, without moving forwards, through the oppression of the
    Daevas and the assaults of the Daevas.
    58. And now they move around in their far-revolving circle for
    ever, till they come to the time of the good restoration of the
    world.


                [[17]]
    59. We worship the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    who watch over the bright sea Vouru-Kasha, to the number of ninety
    thousand, and nine thousand, and nine hundred, and ninety-nine.


                [[18]]

    66. Seeking water for their own kindred, for their own borough,
    for their own town, for their own country, and saying thus: 'May
    our own country have a good store and full joy!'
    67. They fight in the battles that are fought in their own place
    and land, each according to the place and house where he dwelt
    (of yore): they look like a gallant warrior who, girded up and
    watchful, fights for the hoard he has treasured up.

    and to keep him in front, from the Druj unseen, from the female
    Varenya fiend, from the evil-doer bent on mischief, and from that
    fiend who is all death, Angra Mainyu. It will be as if there were
    a thousand men watching over one man;
    72. So that neither the sword well-thrust, neither the club well-falling,
    nor the arrow well-shot, nor the spear well-darted, nor the stones
    flung from the arm shall destroy him.
    73. They come on this side, they come on that side, never resting,
    the good, powerful, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful, asking
    for help thus: 'Who will praise us? Who will offer us a sacrifice?
    Who will meditate upon us? Who will bless us? Who will receive
    us with meat and clothes in his hand and with a prayer worthy
    of bliss? Of which of us will the name be taken for invocation?

    Spirits, they the good, strong, beneficent Fravashis of the faithful,
    who stood holding fast when the two Spirits created the world,
    the Good Spirit and the Evil One.
    77. When Angra Mainyu broke into the creation of the good holiness,
    then came in across Vohu Mano and Atar.
    78. They destroyed the malice of the fiend Angra Mainyu, so that
    the waters did not stop flowing nor did the plants stop growing;

    Ahura Mazda, flowed forward and his plants went on growing.

    him, as the lord and master of the world, as the praiser of the
    most great, most good, and most fair Asha, as having a revelation

    birth and growth all the creatures of the good creations cried
    out, Hail!
    94. 'Hail to us! for he is born, the Athravan, Spitama Zarathushtra.

    Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
    Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One!
    'If I have a curse thrown upon me, a spell told upon me by the
    many men who hate me, what is the remedy for it?'
    35. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Take thou a feather of that bird with
    ... feathers, the Varenjana, O Spitama Zarathushtra! With that
    feather thou shalt rub thy own body, with that feather thou shalt
    curse back thy enemies.
    36. 'If a man holds a bone of that strong bird, or a feather of
    that strong bird, no one can smite or turn to flight that fortunate
    man. The feather of that bird of birds brings him help; it brings
    unto him the homage of men, it maintains in him his glory.
    37. 'Then the sovereign, the lord of countries, will no longer
    kill his hundreds, though he is a killer of men; the .... will
    not kill at one stroke; he alone smites and goes forwards.
    38. 'All tremble before him who holds the feather, they tremble
    therefore before me; all my enemies tremble before me and fear
    my strength and victorious force and the fierceness established
    in my body.
    39. 'He carries the chariot of the lords; he carries the chariots
    of the lordly ones, the chariots of the sovereigns. He carried
    the chariot of Kavi Usa; upon his wings runs the male horse, runs
    the burden-bearing camel, runs the water of the river.
    40. 'Him rode the gallant Thraetaona, who smote Azhi Dahaka, the
    three-mouthed, the three-headed, the six-eyed, who had a thousand
    senses; that most powerful, fiendish Druj, that demon, baleful
    to the world, the strongest Druj that Angra Mainyu created against
    the material world, to destroy the world of the good principle.
    'For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice
    worth being heard....


                [[15]]
    41. 'We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura.
    'Verethraghna confounds the glory of this house with its wealth

    big clouds, full of water, that beat the mountains.
    'For his brightness and glory, I will offer unto him a sacrifice
    worth being heard....


                [[16]]
    42. 'We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura.'
    Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
    Spirit, Maker of the material world thou Holy One! 'Where is it
    that we must invoke the name of Verethraghna, made by Ahura? Where
    is it that we must praise him? That we must humbly praise him?'
    43. Ahura Mazda answered: 'When armies meet together in full array,
    O Spitama Zarathushtra! (asking) which of the two is the party
    that conquers and is not crushed, that smites and is not smitten;
    44. 'Do thou throw four feathers in the way. Whichever of the
    two will first worship the well-shapen Strength, and Verethraghna,
    beautiful of form. made by Mazda, on his side will victory stand.
    45. 'I will bless Strength and Victory, the two keepers, the two
    good keepers, the two maintainers; the two who ..., the two who
    ... the two who ...; the two who forgive, the two who strike off,
    the two who forget.
    46. 'O Zarathushtra! let not that spell be shown to any one, except
    by the father to his son, or by the brother to his brother from
    the same womb, or by the Athravan to his pupil. These are words
    that are awful and powerful, awful and assembly-ruling, awful
    and victorious, awful and healing: these are words that save the
    head that was lost and chant away the uplifted weapon.'


                [[17]]
    47. We sacrifice to Verethraghna, made by Ahura: who goes along
    the armies arrayed, and goes here and there asking, along with
    Mithra and Rashnu: 'Who is it who lies unto Mithra? Who is it
    who thrusts [his oath] against Rashnu? To whom shall I, in my
    might, impart illness and death?'
    48. Ahura Mazda said: 'If men sacrifice unto Verethraghna, made
    by Ahura, if the due sacrifice and prayer is offered unto him
    just as it ought to be performed in the perfection of holiness,
    never will a hostile horde enter the Aryan countries, nor any
    plague, nor leprosy, nor venomous plants, nor the chariot of a
    foe, nor the uplifted spear of a foe.
    49. Zarathushtra asked: 'What is then, O Ahura Mazda! the sacrifice
    and invocation in honour of Verethraghna, made by Ahura, as it
    ought to be performed in the perfection of holiness?'
    50. Ahura Mazda answered: 'Let the Aryan nations bring libations
    unto him; let the Aryan nations tie bundles of baresma for him;
    let the Aryan nations cook for him a head of cattle, either white,
    or black, or of any other colour, but all of one and the same
    colour.
    51. 'Let not a murderer take of those offerings, nor a whore,
    nor a ...., who does not sing the Gathas, who spreads death in
    the world and withstands the law of Mazda, the law of Zarathushtra.
    52. 'If a murderer take of those offerings, or a whore, or a ....,
    who does not sing the Gathas, then Verethraghna, made by Ahura,
    takes back his healing virtues.
    53. 'Plagues will ever pour upon the Aryan nations; hostile hordes
    will ever fall upon the Aryan nations; the Aryans will be smitten
    by their fifties and their hundreds, by their hundreds and their
    thousands, by their thousands and their tens of thousands, by
    their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads.'
    54. There Verethraghna, made by Ahura, proclaimed thus: 'The Soul
    of the Bull, the wise creature, does not receive from man due
    sacrifice and prayer; for now the Daevas and the worshippers of
    the Daevas make blood flow and spill it like water;
    55. 'For now the ... Daevas and the worshippers of the Daevas
    bring to the fire the plant that is called Haperesi, the wood
    that is called Nemetka;
    56. '(Therefore) when the (?Vyambura) Daevas and the worshippers
    of the Daevas bow their backs, bend their waists, and arrange
    all their limbs, they think they will smite and smite not, they
    think they will kill and kill not; and then the (?Vyambura) Daevas
    and the worshippers of the Daevas have their minds confounded
    and their eyes made giddy.'

    great Ashi! thou art well-made and of a noble seed; thou art sovereign
    at thy wish; thou art Glory in a bodily form.
    16. Thy father is Ahura Mazda, the greatest of all gods, the best
    of all gods; thy mother is Armaiti Spenta; thy brothers are Sraosha,
    a god of Asha, and Rashnu, tall and strong, and Mithra, the lord
    of wide pastures, who has ten thousand spies and a thousand ears;

    17. Praised of the gods, unoffended by the righteous, the great
    Ashi Vanguhi stood up on her chariot, thus speaking: 'Who art
    thou who dost invoke me, whose voice is to my ear the sweetest
    of all that invoked me most?'
    18. And he said aloud: 'I am Spitama Zarathushtra, who, first
    of mortals, recited the praise of the excellent Asha and offered
    up sacrifice unto Ahura Mazda and the Amesha-Spentas; in whose
    birth and growth the waters and the plants rejoiced; in whose
    birth and growth the waters and the plants grew; in whose birth
    and growth all the creatures of the good creation cried out, Hail!
    19. 'In whose birth and growth Angra Mainyu rushed away from this
    wide, round earth, whose ends lie afar, and he, the evil-doing
    Angra Mainyu, who is all death, said: "All the gods together
    have not been able to smite me down in spite of myself, and Zarathushtra
    alone can reach me in spite of myself.
    20. '"He smites me with the Ahuna Vairya, as strong a weapon
    as a stone big as a house; he burns me with Asha-Vahishta, as
    if it were melting brass. He makes it better for me that I should
    leave this earth, he, Spitama Zarathushtra, the only one who can
    daunt me."'
    21. And the great Ashi Vanguhi exclaimed: 'Come nearer unto me,
    thou pure, holy Spitama! lean against my chariot!'
    Spitama Zarathushtra came nearer unto her, he leant against her
    chariot.
    22. And she caressed him with the left arm and the right, with
    the right arm and the left, thus speaking: 'Thou art beautiful,
    O Zarathushtra! thou art well-shapen, O Spitama! strong are thy
    legs and long are thy arms: Glory is given to thy body and long
    cheerfulness to thy soul, as sure as I proclaim it unto thee.'

    'When the Turanians and the swift-horsed Naotaras, clapping their
    hands, ran after me,
    55. 'I hid myself under the foot of a bull walking under his burden;
    then young boys, and girls who had known no man, discovered me,
    even while the Turanians and the swift-horsed Naotaras, clapping
    their hands, were running after me.
    56. 'Even I hid myself under the throat of a ram of hundredfold
    energy: then again young boys, and girls who had known no man,
    discovered me, even while the Turanians and the swift-horsed Naotaras,
    clapping their hands, were running after me.'
    57. The first wailing of the great Ashi Vanguhi is her wailing
    about the courtezan who destroys her fruit: 'Stand thou not near
    her, sit thou not on her bed!' - 'What shall I do? Shall I go
    back to the heavens? Shall I sink into the earth?'
    58. The second wailing of the great Ashi Vanguhi is her wailing
    about the courtezan who brings forth a child conceived of a stranger
    and presents it to her husband: 'What shall I do? Shall I go back
    to the heavens? Shall I sink into the earth?'
    59. This is the third wailing of the great Ashi Vanguhi: 'This
    is the worst deed that men and tyrants do, namely, when they deprive
    maids, that have been barren for a long time, of marrying and
    bringing forth children. What shall I do? Shall I go back to the
    heavens? Shall I sink into the earth?'
    60. Ahura Mazda answered: 'O fair and wise Ashi, go not back to
    the heavens, sink not into the earth! Stay here and walk inside
    the fine kingly palace.'
    61. I shall worship thee with such a sacrifice, I shall worship
    and forward thee with such a sacrifice as Vishtaspa offered unto
    thee, behind the river Daitya. The Zaotar lifted up a loud voice,
    with baresma before him. With that sort of sacrifice shall I worship
    thee? With that sort of sacrifice shall I worship and forward
    thee, O fair and wise Ashi?
    For her brightness and glory, I will offer her a sacrifice worth
    being heard....
    62. Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....
    I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour
    of Ashi Vanguhi; of the good Chisti; of the good Erethe; of the
    good Rasastat; of the Glory and Weal, made by Mazda.
    Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....
    [Give] unto that man brightness and glory, give him health of
    body, .... give him the bright, all-happy, blissful abode of the
    holy Ones.

    Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....
    I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathushtra.
    one who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura;
    For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto [Havani],
    the holy and master of holiness ....
    Unto the Glory of the Aryans, made by Mazda,
    Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.
    Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....
    1. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathushtra, saying: 'I made
    the Aryan Glory, rich in food, rich in flocks, rich in wealth,
    rich in Glory; provided with full store of intelligence, with
    full store of money, to withstand Need, and to withstand enemies.
    2. 'It destroys Angra Mainyu, who is all death; it destroys Aeshma,
    the fiend of the wounding spear; it destroys the yellow Bushyasta;
    it destroys the contagion of Aekha; it destroys the fiend of death,
    Apaosha; it destroys the non-Aryan nations.
    3. 'And I made the great Ashi Vanguhi; she comes in, amid the
    family; she comes in, inside the fine royal palace.
    4. 'Let Ashi, with fulness of welfare, follow the man who gladdens
    the faithful with his gifts! she comes in, inside his family;
    she comes in, inside his fine royal palace.
    'With all sorts of flocks, with all victory, with all intelligence,
    with all Glory, the great Ashi Vanguhi puts one foot inside his
    family; she comes in, inside his fine royal palace.
    5. 'Horses multiply a thousandfold, flocks multiply a thousandfold;
    and so does his virtuous offspring, (as) the bright, glorious
    star Tishtrya moves on equally, and so does the strong wind made
    by Mazda, and so does the Glory of the Aryas.
    6. 'And they bring increase on the tops of all mountains, down
    the depths of all vales; they bring increase to all the growing
    plants, the fair, the golden-hued. And they bring (away) the contagion
    of Aekha, they bring (away) the fiend of death, Apaosha.

      19. Zam Yasht
      -------------
      (This Yasht, inscribed to the Genius of the Earth, is devoted to
      a description of the mountains and the kingly Glory (kavaem Hvareno),
      which are invoked, together with the Earth, in the corresponding
      formula of he Sirozah (par. 28) there is no Yasht devoted to the
      Earth itself.)

      The mountains are simply enumerated (pars. 1-8). The rest of the
      Yasht is devoted to the praise of the Hvareno, or, more precisely,
      to that of those who possessed it, whose powers or feats are described.
      The list begins with Ahura Mazda (par. 10), and closes with Saoshyant
      (par. 89); that is to say, it begins with the beginning of the
      world, and closes with its end. It includes the Amesha-Spentas
      (par. 15), Haoshyangha (par. 26), Takhma Urupa (par. 28), Yima
      (par. 31), Mithra (par. 35), Thraetaona (par. 36), Keresaspa (par.
      38), the kings of the Kaianyan dynasty (pars. 66-72), Kavi Husravah
      (par. 74), Zarathushtra (par. 79), Vishtaspa (par. 84). The unsuccessful
      efforts of Franghrasyan to take possession of it are described
      at length (pars. 56-64).

      This Yasht would serve as a short history of the Iranian monarchy,
      an abridged Shah Namah.)

    0. May Ahura Mazda be rejoiced!....
    Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good....
    I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathushtra,
    one who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura;
    For sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification unto [Havani],
    the holy and master of holiness....
    Unto Mount Ushi-darena, made by Mazda, the seat of holy happiness;
    unto the kingly Glory, made by Mazda; unto that Glory that cannot
    be forcibly seized, made by Mazda,
    Be propitiation, with sacrifice, prayer, propitiation, and glorification.
    Yatha ahu vairyo: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness....


                [[1]]
    1. The first mountain that rose up out of the earth, O Spitama
    Zarathushtra! was the Haraiti Barez. That mountain stretches all
    along the shores of the land washed by waters towards the east.
    The second mountain was Mount Zeredho, outside Mount Manusha:
    this mountain too stretches all along the shores of the land washed
    by waters towards the east.
    2. From there grew up Mount Ushi-dhau, Ushi-darena, Mount Erezifya,
    and Mount Fraorepa. The sixth was Mount Erezura. The seventh was
    Mount Bumya. The eighth was Mount Raoidhita. The ninth was Mount
    Mazishishvau. The tenth was Mount Antare-danghu. The eleventh
    was Mount Erezisha. The twelfth was Mount Vaiti-gaesa.
    3. And Mount Adarana, Mount Bayana, Mount Ishkata Upairi-saena,
    with the .... snows; the two Hamankuna mountains, the eight Vasna
    mountains, the eight powerful Fravanku, the four Vidhvana summits;
    4. Mount Aezakha, Mount Maenakha, Mount Vakhedrakae, Mount Asaya,
    Mount Tudhaskae, Mount Isavae, Mount Draoshishvau, Mount Sairivau,
    Mount Nanghushmau, Mount Kakahyu, Mount Antare-Kangha;

    Mount Urunyo-vaidhkae, Mount Asnavant, Mount Ushaoma, Mount Ushta-hvarenah,
    Mount Syamaka, Mount Vafrayau, Mount Vourusha;
    6. Amongst which stand Mount Jatara, Mount Adhutavau, Mount Spitavarena,
    Mount Spento-data, Mount Kadrva-aspa, Mount Kaoirisa, Mount Taera,
    Mount Bara-srayana, Mount Barana, Mount Frapayau, Mount Udrya,
    and Mount Raevant, and all those heights to which men have given
    the name of mount,
    7. To the number of two thousand mountains, and two hundred and
    forty and four, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
    8. For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice
    worth being heard, namely, unto the awful kingly Glory. Unto the
    awful kingly Glory we offer up the libations, the Haoma and meat,
    the baresma, the wisdom of the tongue, the holy spells, the speech,
    the deeds, the libations, and the rightly-spoken words.
    Yenhe hatam: All those beings of whom Ahura Mazda....


                [[2]]
    9. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda; most
    conquering, highly working, that possesses health. wisdom, and
    happiness, and is more powerful to destroy than all other creatures;
    10. That belongs to Ahura Mazda, as (through it) Ahura Mazda made
    the creatures, many and good, many and fair, many and wonderful,
    many and prosperous, many and bright;
    11. So that they may restore the world, which will (thenceforth)
    never grow old and never die, never decaying and never rotting,
    ever living and ever increasing, and master of its wish, when
    the dead will rise, when life and immortality will come, and the
    world will be restored at its wish;
    12. When the creation will grow deathless, - the prosperous creation
    of the Good Spirit, - and the Druj shall perish, though she may
    rush on every side to kill the holy beings; she and her hundredfold
    brood shall perish, as it is the will of the Lord.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[3]]
    14. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    15. That belongs to the Amesha-Spentas, the bright ones, whose
    looks perform their wish, tall, quickly coming to do, strong,
    lordly, who are undecaying and holy;
    16. Who are all seven of one thought, who are all seven of one
    speech, who are all seven of one deed; whose thought is the same,
    whose speech is the same, whose deed is the same, whose father
    and commander is the same, namely, the Maker, Ahura Mazda.
    17. Who see one another's soul thinking of good thoughts, thinking
    of good words, thinking of good deeds, thinking of Garo-nmana,
    and whose ways are shining as they go down to the libations;
    18. Who are the makers and governors, the shapers and overseers,
    the keepers and preservers of these creations of Ahura Mazda.
    19. It is they who shall restore the world, which will (thenceforth)
    never grow old and never die, never decaying and never rotting,
    ever living and ever increasing, and master of its wish, when
    the dead will rise, when life and immortality will come, and the
    world will be restored at its wish;
    20. When the creation will grow deathless, - the prosperous creation
    of the Good Spirit, - and the Druj shall perish, though she may
    rush on every side to kill the holy beings; she and her hundredfold
    brood shall perish, as it is the will of the Lord.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[4]]
    21. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    22. That belongs to the gods in the heavens and to those in the
    material world, and to the blessed ones, born or not yet born,
    who are to perform the restoration of the world.
    23. It is they who shall restore the world, which will (thenceforth)
    never grow old and never die, never decaying and never rotting,
    ever living and ever increasing, and master of its wish, when
    the dead will rise, when life and immortality will come, and the
    world will be restored at its wish;
    24. When the creation will grow deathless, - the prosperous creation
    of the Good Spirit, - and the Druj shall perish, though she may
    rush on every side to kill the holy beings; she and her hundredfold
    brood shall perish, as it is the will of the Lord.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[5]]
    25. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    26. That clave unto Haoshyangha, the Paradhata, for a long time,
    when he ruled over the seven Karshvares of the earth, over the
    Daevas and men, over the Yatus and the Pairikas, over the oppressors,
    the blind, and the deaf; he who smote two-thirds of the Daevas
    of Mazana and of the Varenya fiends.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[6]]
    27. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    28. That clave unto Takhma Urupa, the well-armed, while he ruled
    over the seven Karshvares of the earth, over the paevas and men,
    the Yatus and Pairikas, the oppressors, the blind, and the deaf;
    29. When he conquered all Daevas and men, all the Yatus and Pairikas,
    and rode Angra Mainyu, turned into the shape of a horse, all around
    the earth from one end to the other, for thirty years.
    For its brightness and glory, I win offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[7]]
    30. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    31. That clave unto the bright Yima, the good shepherd, for a
    long time, while he ruled over the seven Karshvares of the earth,
    over the Daevas and men, the Yatus and Pairikas, the oppressors,
    the blind, and the deaf;
    32. He who took from the Daevas both riches and welfare, both
    fatness and flocks, both weal and Glory;
    In whose reign both aliments were never failing for feeding creatures,
    flocks and men were undying, waters and plants were undrying;
    33. In whose reign there was neither cold wind nor hot wind, neither
    old age nor death, nor envy made by the Daevas, in the times before
    his lie, before he began to have delight in words of falsehood
    and untruth.
    34. But when he began to find delight in words of falsehood and
    untruth, the Glory was seen to flee away from him in the shape
    of a bird. When his Glory had disappeared, then the great Yima
    Khshaeta, the good shepherd, trembled and was in sorrow before
    his foes; he was confounded, and laid him down on the ground.
    35. The first time when the Glory departed from the bright Yima,
    the Glory went from Yima, the son of Vivanghant, in the shape
    of a Varaghna bird.
    Then Mithra seized that Glory, Mithra, the lord of wide pastures,
    whose ear is quick to hear, who has a thousand senses. We sacrifice
    unto Mithra, the lord of all countries, whom Ahura Mazda has created
    the most glorious of all the gods in the heavens.
    36. The second time when the Glory departed from the bright Yima,
    the Glory went from Yima, the son of Vivanghant, in the shape
    of a Varaghna bird.
    Then Thraetaona seized that Glory, he, the heir of the valiant
    Athwya clan, who was the most victorious of all victorious men
    next to Zarathushtra;
    37. Who smote Azhi Dahaka, the three-mouthed, the three-headed,
    the six-eyed, who had a thousand senses, that most powerful, fiendish
    Druj, that demon baleful to the world, the strongest Druj that
    Angra Mainyu created against the material world, to destroy the
    world of the good principle.
    38. The third time when the Glory departed from the bright Yima,
    that Glory went from Yima, the son of Vivanghant, in the shape
    of a Varaghna bird.
    Then the manly-hearted Keresaspa seized that Glory; he who was
    the sturdiest of the men of strength, next to Zarathushtra, for
    his manly courage.
    39. For Manly Courage clave unto him. We worship Manly Courage,
    firm of foot, unsleeping, quick to rise, and fully awake, that
    clave unto Keresaspa;
    40. Who killed the snake Srvara, the horse-devouring, men-devouring,
    yellow, poisonous snake, over which yellow poison flowed a thumb's
    breadth thick. Upon him Keresaspa was cooking his food in a brass
    vessel: at the time of noon, the fiend felt the heat, and stood
    upon his feet: he rushed from under the brass vessel and upset
    the boiling water: the manly-hearted Keresaspa fell back affrighted;
    41. Who killed the golden-heeled Gandarewa, that was rushing with
    open jaws, eager to destroy the living world of the good principle;
    Who killed the brood of Pathana, all the nine; and the brood of
    Nivika, and the brood of Dashtayana;
    Who killed the golden-crowned Hitaspa, and Vareshava, the son
    of Dana and Pitaona, attended by many Pairikas;
    42. Who killed Arezo-shamana, him of the manly courage, who was
    strong, well-beloved, hail, energetically rushing, fully awake,
    never falling back....;
    43. Who killed Snavidhaka, him who killed with his nails, the
    stone-handed: thus did he exclaim to all around: 'I am an infant
    still, I am not yet of age: if I ever grow of age, I shall make
    the earth a wheel, I shall make the heavens a chariot;
    44. 'I shall bring down the Good Spirit from the shining Garo-nmana;
    I shall make the Evil Spirit rush up from the dreary Hell. They
    will carry my chariot, both the Good Spirit and the Evil One,
    unless the manly-hearted Keresaspa kill me.'
    The manly-hearted Keresaspa killed him, his life went away, his
    spirit vanished.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[8]]
    45. We sacrifice unto the awful Glory, that cannot be forcibly
    seized, made by Mazda ....
    46. For which the Good Spirit and the Evil One did struggle with
    one another: for that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized they
    flung each of them their darts most swift.
    The Good Spirit flung a dart, and so did Vohu-Mano, and Asha-Vahishta
    and Atar, the son of Ahura Mazda.
    The Evil Spirit flung a dart, and so did Akem-Mano, and Aeshma
    of the wounding spear and Azhi Dahaka and Spityura, he who sawed
    Yima in twain.
    47. Then forward came Atar, the son of Ahura Mazda, thinking thus
    in his heart: 'I want to seize that Glory that cannot be forcibly
    seized.'
    But Azhi Dahaka, the three-mouthed, he of the evil law, rushed
    on his back, thinking of extinguishing it:
    48. 'Here give it up to me; O Atar, son of Ahura Mazda: if thou
    seizest that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, I shall rush
    upon thee, so that thou mayest never more blaze on the earth made
    by Ahura and protect the world of the good principle.'
    And Atar took back his hands, as the instinct of life prevailed,
    so much had Azhi affrighted him.
    49. Then Azhi, the three-mouthed, he of the evil law, rushed forward,
    thinking thus in his heart: 'I want to seize that Glory that cannot
    be forcibly seized.'
    But Atar, the son of Ahura Mazda, advanced behind him, speaking
    in these words:
    50. 'There give it up to me, thou three-mouthed Azhi Dahaka. If
    thou seizest that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, then I
    will enter thy hinder part, I will blaze up in thy jaws, so that
    thou mayest never more rush upon the earth made by Mazda and destroy
    the world of the good principle.'
    Then Azhi took back his hands, as the instinct of life prevailed,
    so much had Atar affrighted him.
    51. That Glory swells up and goes to the sea Vouru-Kasha. The
    swift-horsed Son of the Waters seizes it at once: this is the
    wish of the Son of the Waters, the swift-horsed: 'I want to seize
    that Glory that cannot be forcibly seized, down to the bottom
    of the sea Vouru-Kasha, in the bottom of the deep rivers.'
    52. We sacrifice unto the Son of the Waters, the swift-horsed,
    the tall and shining lord, the lord of females; the male god,
    who helps one at his appeal; who made man, who shaped man, a god
    who lives beneath waters, and whose ear is the quickest to hear
    when he is worshipped.
    53. 'And whosoever of you, O men,' - thus said Ahura Mazda, -
    'O holy Zarathushtra! shall seize that Glory that cannot be forcibly
    seized, he has the gifts of an Athravan; whosoever shall long
    for the illumination of knowledge, he has the gifts of an Athravan;
    whosoever shall long for fulness of knowledge, he has the gifts
    of an Athravan;
    54. 'And Riches will cleave unto him, giving him full welfare,
    holding a shield before him, powerful, rich of cattle and garments;
    and Victory will cleave unto him, day after day; and likewise
    Strength, that smites more than a year. Attended by that Victory,
    he will conquer the havocking hordes; attended by that Victory,
    he will conquer all those who hate him.' For its brightness and
    glory, I will offer it a sacrifice....


                [[9]]
    55. We sacrifice unto the awful Glory, that cannot be forcibly
    seized, made by Mazda ....
    56. Which the Turanian ruffian Frangrasyan tried to seize in the
    sea Vouru-Kasha. He stripped himself naked, wishing to seize that
    Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and
    to the holy Zarathushtra. But the Glory escaped, the Glory fled
    away, the Glory changed its seat, and an arm of the sea Vouru-Kasha
    was produced, namely, that lake that is called Lake Husravah.
    57. Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed out of the
    sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathushtra! thinking evil thoughts:
    '.... I have not been able to conquer the Glory that belongs to
    the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathushtra.
    58. 'Then I will defile all corn and liquors, as to greatness,
    goodness, and fairness.'
    - 'Ahura Mazda will come against thee, ever eager to create new
    creatures.'
    Then the most crafty Turania Frangrasyan rushed down into the
    sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
    59. A second time he stripped himself naked, wishing to seize
    that Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn,
    and to the holy Zarathushtra. But the Glory escaped, the Glory
    fled away, the Glory changed its seat, and an arm of the sea Vouru-Kasha
    was produced, namely, that lake that is called Lake Vanghazdau.
    60. Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed out of the
    sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathushtra! thinking evil thoughts:
    '.... I have not been able to conquer the Glory that belongs to
    the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathushtra.
    61. 'Then I will defile all corn and liquors, as to greatness,
    goodness, and fairness.'
    - 'Ahura Mazda will come against thee, ever eager to create new
    creatures.'
    Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed down into the
    sea Vouru-Kasha.
    62. A third time he stripped himself naked, wishing to seize the
    Glory that belongs to the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and
    to the holy Zarathushtra. But the Glory escaped, the Glory fled
    away, the Glory changed its seat, and an arm was produced in the
    sea Vouru-Kasha, namely, the water that is called Awzh-danva.
    63. Then the most crafty Turanian Frangrasyan rushed out of the
    sea Vouru-Kasha, O Spitama Zarathushtra! thinking evil thought:
    '.... I have not been able to conquer the Glory that belongs to
    the Aryan nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathushtra!'
    64. He was not able to seize the Glory that belongs to the Aryan
    nations, born and unborn, and to the holy Zarathushtra.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[10]]
    65. We sacrifice unto the awful Glory that cannot be forcibly
    seized, made by Mazda ....
    66. That cleaves unto him who grows up there, where lies Lake
    Kasava, along with the Haetumant river; there where stands Mount
    Ushidhau, surrounded by waters, that run from the mountain.
    67. It runs unto him, it flows and swells unto him, bringing good
    pastures and fine horses, bringing plenty, full of glory; with
    beauty and weal; powerful and friendly, rich of pastures, prolific
    and golden. It runs unto him, it flows and swells unto him, bright
    and glorious, making the white .... grow, smiting away all plagues.
    68. And there comes with him a horse's strength, there comes with
    him a camel's strength, there comes with him a man's strength,
    there comes with him the kingly Glory: and there is in him, O
    holy Zarathushtra! so much of kingly Glory as might extinguish
    at once all the non-Aryan nations.
    69. And then (through it) living creatures may keep away hunger
    and death, living creatures (may keep away) cold and heat. Such
    is the kingly Glory, the keeper of the Aryan nations and of the
    five kinds of animals, made to help the faithful and the Law of
    the worshippers of Mazda.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[11]]
    70. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    71. That clave unto Kavi Kavata, and unto Kavi Aipivohu, and unto
    Kavi Usadha, and unto Kavi Arshan, and unto Kavi Pisina, and unto
    Kavi Byarshan, and unto Kavi Syavarshan;
    72. So that they were all of them brave, all of them strong, all
    of them healthful, all of them wise, all of them happy in their
    wishes, all of them powerful kings.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[12]]
    73. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    74. That clave unto Kavi Husravah for the well-shapen Strength,
    for the Victory made by Ahura, for the crushing Ascendant; for
    the righteousness of the law, for the innocence of the law, for
    the unconquerable power of the law; for the extermination of the
    enemies at one stroke;
    75. And for the vigour of health, for the Glory made by Mazda,
    for the health of the body, and for a good, virtuous offspring,
    wise, chief in assemblies, bright, and clear-eyed, that frees
    [their father] from the pangs [of hell], of good intellect; and
    for that part in the blessed world that falls to wisdom and to
    those who do not follow impiety;
    76. And for a dominion full of splendour, for a long, long life,
    and for all boons and remedies; 77. So that king Husravah [had
    the lead] all along the long race, and he could not pass through
    the forest, he, the murderer, who was fiercely striving against
    him on horseback; the lord Kavi Husravah prevailed over all; he
    put in bonds Frangrasyan and Keresavazda, to avenge the murder
    of his father Syavarshana, a man, and of Aghraeratha, a semi-man.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[13]]
    78. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    79. That clave unto the holy Zarathushtra, so that he thought
    according to the Law, spake according to the Law, and did according
    to the Law; so that he was the holiest in holiness in all the
    living world, the best-ruling in exercising rule, the brightest
    in brightness, the most glorious in glory, the most victorious
    in victory.
    80. At his sight the Daevas rushed away; at his sight the (demoniac)
    malices were extinguished; at his sight the Jainis drew hack their
    ways from the mortals and, lamenting and wailing, laid violent
    hands on the Daevas.
    81. And that one prayer, the Ahuna Vairya, which the holy Zarathushtra
    sang and repeated four times, with a song that waxed louder and
    louder, drove back all the Daevas beneath the earth, and took
    off from them sacrifice and prayer.
    82. It was it, the Glory of Zarathushtra, that the Turanian ruffian
    Frangrasyan tried to seize to rule over all the Karshvares; round
    about the seven Karshvares did that ruffian Frangrasyan rush,
    trying to seize the Glory of Zarathushtra. But that Glory escaped
    to hidden inlets of the sea; and there those two made my will
    roll on; they entered my will, as it was my wish, Ahura Mazda's,
    and as it was the wish of the Law of Mazda.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[14]]
    83. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    84. That clave unto king Vistaspa, so that he thought according
    to the Law, spake according to the Law, and did according to the
    Law; so that he professed that Law, destroying his foes and causing
    the Daevas to retire.
    85. Who, driving the Druj before him, sought wide room for the
    holy religion; who, driving the Druj before him, made wide room
    for the holy religion; who made himself the arm and support of
    this law of Ahura, of this law of Zarathushtra;
    86. Who took her, standing bound, from the hands of the Hunus,
    and established her to sit in the middle [of the world], high
    ruling, never falling back, holy, nourished with plenty of cattle
    and pastures, blessed with plenty of cattle and pastures.
    87. The valiant king Vishtaspa conquered all enemies, Tathravant
    of the evil law, Peshana, the worshipper of the Daevas, and the
    fiendish wicked Arejat-aspa and the other wicked Hvyaonas.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[15]]
    88. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    89. That will cleave unto the victorious Saoshyant and his helpers,
    when he shall restore the world, which will (thenceforth) never
    grow old and never die, never decaying and never rotting, ever
    living and ever increasing, and master of its wish, when the dead
    will rise, when life and immortality will come, and the world
    will be restored at its wish;
    90. When the creation will grow deathless, - the prosperous creation
    of the Good Spirit, - and the Druj shall perish, though she may
    rush on every side to kill the holy beings; she and her hundredfold
    brood shall perish, as it is the will of the Lord.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....


                [[16]]
    91. We sacrifice unto the awful kingly Glory, made by Mazda ....
    92. When Astvat-ereta shall rise up from Lake Kasava, a friend
    of Ahura Mazda, a son of Vispa-taurvairi, knowing the victorious
    knowledge.
    It was that Glory that Thraetaona bore with him when Azhi Dahaka
    was killed;
    93. That Frangrasyan, the Turanian, bore when Drvau was killed,
    when the Bull was killed;
    That king Husravah bore when Frangrasyan, the Turanian, was killed;
    That king Vishtaspa bore, when he victoriously maintained Holiness
    against the host of the fiends and took off the Druj from the
    world of the good principle.
    94. He, with the eye of intelligence, shall look down upon all
    the creatures of the Paeshish, her of the evil seed: he shall
    look upon the whole living world with the eye of plenty, and his
    look shall deliver to immortality the whole of the living creatures.
    95. And there shall his friends come forward, the friends of Astvat-ereta,
    who are fiend-smiting, well-thinking, well-speaking, well-doing,
    following the good law, and whose tongues have never uttered a
    word of falsehood.
    Before them shall Aeshma of the wounding spear, who has no Glory,
    bow and flee; he shall smite the most wicked Druj, her of the
    evil seed, born of darkness.
    96. Akem-Mano smites, but Vohu-Mano shall smite him; the Word
    of falsehood smites, but the Word of truth shall smite it. Haurvatat
    and Ameretat shall smite both hunger and thirst: Haurvatat and
    Ameretat shall smite the evil hunger and the evil thirst. The
    evil-doing Angra Mainyu bows and flees, becoming powerless.
    For its brightness and glory, I will offer it a sacrifice ....
    97. Yatha ahu vairya: The will of the Lord is the law of holiness
    ....
    I bless the sacrifice and prayer, and the strength and vigour
    of Mount Ushi-darena, made by Mazda, the seat of holy happiness;
    of the kingly Glory, made by Mazda; of the Glory that cannot be
    forcibly seized, made by Mazda.
    Ashem Vohu: Holiness is the best of all good ....
    [Give] unto that man brightness and glory, .... give him the bright,
    all-happy, blissful abode of the holy Ones.

    one who hates the Daevas and obeys the laws of Ahura;

    Afrinagans (prayers of blessing)
    --------------------------------
    (Translated by L. Mills (From Sacred Books of the East,
    American Edition, 1898.)

      Afrinagan-i Dahman
      ------------------
    1. Yatha Ahu Vairyo...(2).
    Ashem Vohu...(3).
    I profess myself a Mazda-worshipper, a follower of Zarathushtra,
    opposing the Daevas, accepting the Ahuric doctrine.

      (Here recite the appropriate Gah dedication.)

    With propitiation of the Dahman Afrin of the good ones and the
    strong wise one with higher intellect, for worship, adoration,
    propitiation, and praise.
    'Yatha Ahu Vairyo', the zaotar should say to me
    'Yatha Ahu Vairyo', he who is the zaotar should say to me
    'Atha ratush ashatchit hacha', the Asha-sanctified knowing one
    should say.

    (Karda:)
    2. May these blessings of the Asha-sanctified come into this
    house, namely, rewards, compensation, and hospitality; and may
    there now come to this community Asha, possessions, prosperity,
    good fortune, and easeful life, and the long enduring prominence
    of this Religion, which is Ahuric, Zarathushtrian.
    3. Now in this house may the cattle not be tainted, nor the Asha,
    nor the strength of Asha-sanctified men, nor the Ahuric doctrine.
    4. May the good, prosperity-giving, holy, Asha-sanctified, fravashis
    come here, accompanied by the healing virtues of Ashi, to the
    width of the Earth, the length of the rivers, and the height of
    the sun, to give the possession of good things, for the overthrow
    of misfortunes, and the advancement of riches and fortunes.
    5. May Hearkening (Sraosha) overcome disobedience within this
    house, and may peace overcome discord, generosity overcome greed,
    reverence overcome rebellion, and honesty overcome falsehood.
    May Asha conquer the fiend,
    6. so that, in it the Amesha Spentas may receive, through Sraosha,
    companion of Ashi, good acts of worship and prayers of praise;
    good in reverence and adoration, the abiding offering, the joyous
    offering, and the devotional offering, until the time of the final
    harvest.
    7. Let the comfort-giving good fortune never forsake this house,
    nor the comfort-giving riches, nor comfort-giving noble offspring,
    with long lasting company of what bestows paradise and good rewards.
    Ashem Vohu...(3)!

    (Asirvad:)
    8. To Ahura Mazda, rich, possessing good things. Blessings on
    the rulers of the land, for greater strength, greater victory,
    greater rule, greater sovereignty, compassion, long rule, enduring
    physical vitality, and health.
    9. (Blessings) to Ama, well-built, fair of form, to Verethraghna,
    made by Ahura, and to the triumphing Uparatat, completely repelling
    malice, completely conquering the hostile malicious adversary
    with a blow.
    10. Blessings so that he may be winner of the battle, victorious
    over every malicious adversary, over every evil adversary, faulty
    in thoughts, words and deeds.
    11. (Blessings) that he may be victorious through timely thoughts,
    words, and deeds; to suppress all the evil-minded, and all Daeva-worshippers,
    so as to attain to good reward, and to good renown, and to long
    happiness of my soul.
    12. Blessings for long life, for the desired life, for the service
    of Asha-sanctified people, and for the disservice of ill done
    deeds - the best existence of the Asha-sanctified, the luminous,
    offering all blissful. Thus may it come as I wish.
    We praise good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, performed
    here and elsewhere, now and in the past. Thus we glorify and invoke
    all that is good (2).
    I yearn for good mind. May Peshotan son on Gushtasp come to my
    aid, may he accept my prayers, may he shine for me. Thus may the
    holy attain long life and may their desires be fulfilled.
    May this Afrinagan and Khshnuman reach the Yazad Dahman.
    May the knowledge, promulgation, and glory of the good Mazdayasnian
    religion spread throughout the seven regions of the world, through
    speech, righteous persuasion, the good kingly authority and justice.
    So be it.
    Yatha Ahu Vairyo....
    Ashem Vohu...!
    13. Yatha Ahu Vairyo...(2).
    I desire worship and adoration and strength and force for the
    Dahman Afrin of the good ones and the valiant wise one with higher
    intellect.
    Ashem Vohu....
    May we all be one in Asha.
    Thus may it come as I wish.
    We praise good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, performed
    here and elsewhere, now and in the past. Thus we glorify and invoke
    all that is good.


      Afrinagan-i Gatha
      -----------------
    1. As the Ahu is (revered and) to be chosen, so (is) the Ratu
    (one who rules) from the Righteous Order, a creator of mental
    goodness, and of life's actions done for Ahura, and the Kingdom
    (is) to Mazda, which to the poor may offer a nurturer.
    I confess myself a Mazda-worshipper - for the praise of Ahura
    Mazda, the resplendent, the glorious, and of the Bountiful Immortals,
    for the bountiful and holy Gathas which rule in the ritual order.
    (Propitiation and praise be) to the Gatha Ahunavaiti, and to the
    Gatha Ushtavaiti, to the Gatha Spenta-mainyu, and to the Gatha
    Vohu-khshathra, and to the Gatha Vahishtoishti. 2. Propitiation
    to the Fravashis of the saints, the mighty, overwhelming, even
    to those of the saints of yore, who held the primeval faith (the
    Gathic faith), and to those of the next of kin.
    3. We sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the resplendent, the glorious;
    and we sacrifice to the Amesha Spenta who rule aright, and who
    dispose (of all aright). And we sacrifice to the bounteous and
    holy Gathas, which rule (as the first) in the ritual order.
    We sacrifice to the Gatha Ahunavaiti, the holy, as it rules in
    the ritual order; and we sacrifice to the Gatha Ushtavaiti, the
    holy, as it rules in the ritual order; and we sacrifice to the
    Gatha Spenta-mainyu, the holy, as it rules in the ritual order;
    and we sacrifice to the Gatha Vohu-khshathra, the holy, as it
    rules in the ritual order; and we sacrifice to the Gatha Vahishtoishti,
    the holy, as it rules in the ritual order.
    4. (=Yt13.49-52.)


      Afrinagan-i Gahambar
      --------------------
      [This prayer is part of the ceremony of blessing (Afrinagan)
      addressed to the community during the great seasonal festivals
      (Gahambars).]

    1. I confess myself a Mazda-worshipper, and of Zarathustra's
    order, a foe of the Daevas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for
    the holy Havani, the regulator of the ritual order (and its lord
    in its turn), for its sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise;
    (and I confess myself) for Savanghi and for Visya, the holy lords
    of the ritual order for their sacrifice, homage, propitiation,
    and praise, and for that of the Asnya, the day-lords of the days
    during daylight, and of the days in their length, for the Mahya,
    month-lords, and the Yairya, year-lords, and for those of the
    especial seasons, and for the worship, homage, propitiation, and
    praise of that lofty lord who is the Ritual Righteousness (itself);
    yea, for the worship, homage, propitiation, and praise of the
    lords of the days, months, years, and seasons - for those lords
    of the ritual order who are of all the greatest, who are the regulators
    of the ritual at the time of Havani.
    2. To Maidhyo-zaremya, the lord [or to Maidhyo-shema, the lord,
    or to Paitishahya, the lord, or to Ayathrima, Maidhyairya, or
    Hamaspathmaedhaya], be propitiation, homage, and praise.
    3. O ye Mazdayasnians who are here present offer ye this ritual
    service, and present ye the Myazda which is that of the Maidhyo-zaremaya,
    taking a piece of sound flesh from a choice beast, with a full
    flow of milk.
    4. If ye are able to do this, (well); if ye are unable to do
    it, ye may take then (a portion) of some liquor of equal value,
    it matters not which it is, and have it consumed as it is proper;
    and so be ye discreet from your obedience, most correctly faithful
    in your speech, most saintly from your sanctity, best ordered
    in your exercise of power, least straitened by oppressions, heart-easy
    with rejoicings, most merciful of givers, most helpful to the
    poor, fulfilling most the ritual, the blest and longed-for Asha,
    (coy ?) riches woman-minded (?) bringing (as reward). If ye can
    do this and with vigour, (well); (5) if not, bring wood to the
    Ratu's house. It matters not what kind, so it be well cut, and
    very dry, and in loads of fitting size. If that is possible, (well);
    if not, let a man bring wood to the Ratu's dwelling, and heap
    it up as high as the ear, or to reach the fore-shoulder, or with
    the fore-arm measure, (or at least as high as the end of the hanging
    hand). If that is possible, (well); (6) but if it has not been
    possible, then let the worshipper (with the mind's offering) ascribe
    the power to him who rules the best, Ahura, (saying): Wherefore
    for this cause verily we offer and ascribe the Sovereign Power
    to Ahura Mazda, who rules the best, and to Righteousness (the
    ritual and moral Order), and we complete our sacrifice to them.
    Thus is the Myazda offered with the well-timed prayer for blessings.
    7. In case that a man does not give of the first Myazda which
    is that of the Maidhyo-zaremaya, O Spitama Zarathushtra! the Ratu
    that has the right to that Myazda, and who has this person under
    his guidance, expels that (false) disciple who has not his Myazda
    with him, as a man that does not worship, from the midst of the
    Mazda-worshippers. 8. In the case that a man does not give of
    the second Myazda, O Spitama Zarathushtra! which is that of the
    Maidhyo-shema, then let the Ratu to whom the Myazda should come,
    and who has the person under his guidance, expel that disciple,
    since he comes without his Myazda, as he would a man who refuses
    to recite his vows, from among the number of the Mazda-worshippers.
    9. In the case that a man does not give of the third Myazda, O
    Spitama Zarathushtra! which is that of Paitishahya, then let the
    Ratu who ought to receive that Myazda, and who has had the person
    under his guidance, expel that disciple which brings no Myazda,
    as a detected reprobate, from among the number of the Mazdayasnians.
    10. In case that a man does not offer of the fourth Myazda, O
    Spitama Zarathushtra! which is that of the Ayathrima let the Ratu
    who ought to receive that Myazda, and who has the person under
    his guidance, expel that disciple, since he brings no Myazda,
    as a refuse beast from among the number of the Mazdayasnians.
    11. In the case that a man does not give of the fifth Myazda,
    which is that of the Maidhyairya, then let the Ratu to whom that
    Myazda belongs as a perquisite, and who has that person under
    his guidance, expel him, since he brings no Myazda, as an alien,
    from among the number of the Mazdayasnians. 12. In case that a
    man does not give of the sixth Myazda, which is that of the Hamaspathmaedhaya,
    O Spitama Zarathushtra! let the Ratu to whom that Myazda belongs
    as a perquisite, and who has this person under his discipline
    to learn him the lore of Ahura, expel him, (as ignorant) since
    he brings no Myazda, from among the number of the Mazdayasnians.
    13. And let him decry him afterwards without hesitation, and drive
    him out; and let that Ratu lay upon him afterwards the expiating
    deeds without reserve; and in accordance with these rules, let
    the disciple treat the Ratu. (Let him beware of failure to bring
    his Myazda, or if he fails let the disciple bear, as is befitting,
    what is due.) A blessing is Righteousness (called) the Best, it
    is weal, it is weal for this (man) when toward Righteousness Best
    there is right.
    14. I bless with my prayer the royal Province-chiefs (who are
    faithful worshippers) of Ahura Mazda, the resplendent, the glorious,
    (beseeching) for superior strength for them, and for more important
    victory, and more influential rule, and desiring for them further
    authoritative power, and helpful support, and long duration to
    their reign, and the prolonged vitality of their frames, and health.
    15. And I pray in my benediction for strength well-shaped and
    stately of growth, and which smites victoriously, Ahura-made,
    and crushing, and for an ascendency abundantly subduing all who
    are filled with furious hate, assaulting the evil-minded enemies,
    and destroying, as if at once, the deadly, godless foes.
    16. And I pray in my blessing that he (the province-governor)
    may conquer in victorious battles every malicious foe, and each
    malignant, profane in thoughts, and words, and actions, (17) that
    he may indeed be constantly victorious in his own religious thoughts,
    and words, and deeds, and unvarying in the smiting of every foe,
    and of every Daeva-worshipper, and that he may, as he proceeds,
    be well rewarded, and of good repute, possessing a far-foreseeing
    preparation of the soul. 18. And I pray with blessings thus: Live
    thou long and blessed be thou, 'hail' to thee; live for the aid
    of holy men, and for the crushing of the evil; and I pray for
    Heaven (for thee) the best world of the saints, shining, all glorious.
    And thus may it happen as I pray -. And I bless in my prayer the
    sacrifice, and homage, and the strength, and swiftness of the
    day-lords during daylight, and of the lords of the days in their
    length, of the month-lords, and the year-lords, and of the lords
    of the seasons (in their course), and for the worship, homage,
    propitiation, and praise of the lofty lord who is the Righteous
    Ritual itself, and of those lords of the ritual who are of all
    the greatest, and who are the lords of the ritual at the time
    of Havani, for Maidhyo-zaremaya the lord, [(or) for Maidhyo-shema
    the lord, (or) for Paitishahya the lord, or for Ayathrima, Maidhyairya,
    or Hamaspathmaedhaya].


      Afrinagan-i Rapithwin
      ---------------------
    1. I confess myself a Mazda-worshipper, of Zarathushtra's order,
    a foe to the Daevas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for Rapithwina,
    the holy lord of the ritual order, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation,
    and praise, and for Fradat-fshu and Zantuma, the holy lord(s)
    of the ritual order. 2. And to Ahura Mazda, the resplendent, the
    glorious, and to the Bountiful Immortals, be propitiation, and
    to Asha Vahishta (who is Righteousness the Best), and to the Fire,
    Ahura Mazda's son, and to all the holy Yazads, heavenly and earthly,
    and to the Fravashis of the saints, the mighty and overwhelming-.
    3. For thus did Ahura Mazda speak to Spitama Zarathushtra the
    word which was spoken for the ritual time of the Rapithwina, (saying):
    Ask us, O holy Zarathushtra, what are Thy questions to be asked
    of us, for Thy question is as that mighty one when Thy ruler speaks
    his mighty wish. 4. Then Zarathushtra asked Ahura Mazda: O Ahura
    Mazda, most bountiful creator of the material worlds and holy!
    what does that man acquire, what does he merit, what reward
    shall there be for that man (5) who shall recite the Rapithwina
    office with the Rapithwina prayer for blessing, and who shall
    sacrifice with the Rapithwina office with hands (well) washed,
    and with (well) washed mortars, with the Baresman spread, and
    with Haoma high uplifted, and with fire brightly flaming,with
    Ahuna-vairya loud intoned, with Haoma-moistened tongue, and with
    a body Mathra-bound?
    6. And Ahura Mazda answered him: As the wind from the southern
    quarter, O Spitama! causes the entire material world to advance
    and to increase, and as it will bless it, rejoice it, and cause
    it to progress, such a like reward does such a man receive, (7)
    who recites the Rapithwina-ratu with the Rapithwina blessing,
    and sacrifices with it with (well) washed hands, and mortars,
    with Baresman spread, and Haoma lifted, with fire brightly flaming,
    and with Ahuna-vairya loud intoned, and with Haoma-moistened tongue,
    and a body Mathra-bound! 8. Thus hath Ahura Mazda declared to
    Spitama Zarathushtra the word which (should be) spoken at the
    Rapithwina time.
    9-10. (See A1.14-19.)
