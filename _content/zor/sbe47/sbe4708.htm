<p>1. About the marvellousness which is manifested from the first conference onwards till the end of the seventh conference which occurred within the duration of ten years, also his pre-eminence in prophecy in the world, <I>and</I> the acceptance of the religion <I>by</I> the exalted Ka&icirc;-Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, as <I>happened</I> after the ten years of conference.</p>  
<p>2. In <I>the first</I> two years, one <I>marvel</I> is this which is declared, that when he was back from the first conference, he then, by the first command of the lord <I>and</I> creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, recited the unique formula (&acirc;y&icirc;n&#335;) in an assemblage (ram) of K&icirc;gs and Karaps, the prophecy of his Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshipping religion and commemoration of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, as he chanted with a loud voice, and invited mankind to the religion of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>. 3. Just as this <I>passage</I> of revelation mentions thus: 'Thereupon, the thorough inspection for this material existence of those with a <I>sacred</I> girdle, provided with dwellings <I>and</I> provided with cattle, <I>was</I> altogether arranged by Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t.'</p>  
<p>4. And when their announcement (niv&ecirc;di<I>s</I>n&#335;) for</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A></p>  
<p>speaking to be heard <I>was</I> issued&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, then Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, on becoming exalted, called out unto the embodied world of righteousness to extol righteousness and to scorn the demons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 5. 'The homage of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, <I>and</I> the ceremonial and obeisance for the archangels <I>are</I> the best for you I assert and of deprecation (ay<I>a</I><I>z</I>i<I>s</I>n&icirc;h) for the demons next-of-kin marriage is really the best intimation, so that, from the information which is given <I>as to</I> the trustworthiness of a good work, the greatest are the most intimate of them, <I>those of</I> father <I>and</I> daughter, son <I>and</I> she who bore <I>him</I>, and brother <I>and</I> sister.'</p>  
<p>6. <I>It is</I> declared that, upon those words, innumerable demon-worshipping K&icirc;gs and Karaps have rushed upon Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t and strove for his death, just like this which revelation states:&#8212;'It is then a number (mar) have run away who have sat in the vicinity of T&ucirc;r's progeny (h&ucirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I>k&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the arbitrator: and the shame of the brother of T&ucirc;r arose, like <I>that of</I> a person whose shame <I>was</I> that they spoke of his next-of-kin marriage so that he might contract it.'</p>  
<p>7. This T&ucirc;r <I>was</I> A&ucirc;rv&acirc;&icirc;t&acirc;-dang&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the T&ucirc;r, the scanty giver, <I>who</I> was like a great sovereign of that</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A></p>  
<p>quarter; many troops and <I>much</I> power <I>were</I> also maintained by him, and the multitude (mar) told him they would seize the great <I>one</I> from <I>him</I> who is little.</p>  
<p>8. <I>But</I> the progeny of A&ucirc;rv&acirc;&icirc;t&acirc;-dang the T&ucirc;r, the scanty giver, <I>spoke</I> thus: '<I>Should</I> we for that <I>speech</I> destroy him, this great <I>one</I> who mingles together those propitious words <I>for</I> us&#8212;where we are thus without doubt <I>as to</I> one thing therein, <I>such</I> as next-of-kin marriage, that it is not necessary to contract <I>it</I>&#8212;it would make us ever doubtful whether it <I>might</I> be necessary to contract it.'</p>  
<p>9. And A&ucirc;rv&acirc;&icirc;t&acirc;-dang the T&ucirc;r, the scanty giver, spoke thus: 'Thou shalt not destroy that man whom mine eyes <I>have</I> seen <I>as</I> the most loving-eyed of the whole embodied existence; he <I>will</I> attain strength, for it <I>has</I> not seemed to me, when thou destroyest him on this account, <I>that</I> wisdom <I>has</I> arisen <I>for</I> a long time; so that no rule (&acirc;hank&#335;) <I>of</I> wisdom <I>will</I> arise, in this earth, which is so counselling (han<I>g</I>aman&icirc;g) as this <I>one</I> is (that is, when they destroy a man who is counselling, wisdom <I>will</I> not arise <I>for</I> a long while).'</p>  
<p>10. A&ucirc;rv&acirc;&icirc;t&acirc;-dang the T&ucirc;r, the scanty giver to his own <I>people</I>, also spoke thus: 'For me thou art a pure <I>man</I> who is counselling.'</p>  
<p>11. And Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t spoke thus: 'I <I>shall</I> not always be that quiet speaker, by&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> whom that I <I>have</I> mentioned is the most propitious <I>thing</I> to be obtained; and of interfering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> speaking and managing the temper <I>there</I> is a next-of-kin marriage, and the high-priest</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A></p>  
<p><I>who has</I> contracted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <I>it</I> is to perform the ceremonial.'</p>  
<p>12. And here the good spiritual lordship and mightiness of glory of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, those which are provided for commemoration <I>of</I> the supreme lord and creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, are manifested <I>as</I> a great wonder to the multitude, <I>and there</I> is rendered visible the great pre-eminence which is in him <I>as</I> a prophet <I>of</I> the creatures, which for the baseness (nank&icirc;h) of the deceitful Agash&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the secret-moving and deceiving-natured, is the concealed control of a good disposition. 13. Then idleness, like even the habit of fear and nature of apostasy, is an attractor of every one of the multitude, when it extends to much length; little by little, too, that guide and combatant becomes a petitioner for greatness, <I>and it is</I> manifest through that compassion (tang-libbem<I>&acirc;</I>&icirc;h) and superior mindfulness of his, <I>and</I> through the glory of that stout champion, <I>there are</I> much fame <I>and</I> treasure.</p>  
<p>14. The nobles of A&ucirc;rv&acirc;&icirc;t&acirc;-dang the T&ucirc;r, the ruler of the land, <I>were</I> angry and clamourers for Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t's death; but he invited the K&icirc;gs and Karaps to the religion of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, just as this <I>passage</I> of revelation states that Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t also spoke thus: 'Worldly righteousness, <I>O</I> A&ucirc;rv&acirc;&icirc;t&acirc;-dang, <I>thou</I> T&ucirc;r <I>and</I> scanty giver! is the whole <I>of the worship of</I> the demons and the termination of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t.' 15. And A&ucirc;rv&acirc;&icirc;t&acirc;-dang the T&ucirc;r, the scanty giver, spoke thus: '<I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas! thou shalt not attract me to this evil in which thou really art.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A></p>  
<p>16. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t also spoke thus: 'A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> enquired of me thus: "<I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! when thou hast come away to us, among the spiritual lords, who of the people in thy material existence <I>was</I> the protector of the powerful men who <I>are</I> warriors, <I>that was</I> most seeking benefit, most seeking cattle, most extensively associating, most fully-supplying (that is, he gives out most things), and most hospitable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (<I>that is, one</I> saw the door of a prince's (khid&icirc;v&#335;) treasury)?" I replied to him thus: "A&ucirc;rv&acirc;&icirc;t&acirc;-clang the T&ucirc;r, the scanty giver."'</p>  
<p>17. 'And he spoke <I>in</I> reply to me thus: "Him, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! thou shalt attract, first of the men <I>who are</I> warriors, to thinking about, speaking about, and acting about this religion which is A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>'s and Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t's. 18. If you attract him, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! and he believes in it and also gives currency to this <I>religion</I> of thine, and sits before <I>thee</I> in discipleship, this that <I>one</I> calls discipleship of thine he shall undertake, and the religion he hears fully he shall propagate (r&ucirc;b&acirc;k va<I>b</I>&icirc;d&ucirc;ny&ecirc;n); he is also ever after, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! the first of the men <I>who are</I> warriors, the <I>one</I> most seeking benefit, most seeking cattle, most extensively associating, and most hospitable of those who have yet been born <I>and</I> who <I>will</I> henceforth be born. 19. And if you do not attract him, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! and he does not believe in it, nor gives currency <I>to</I> this <I>religion</I> of thine, nor hears <I>it</I>, nor even sits before thee, nor would sit before thee, so that <I>it is</I> obvious to me that <I>he</I> is not attracted, thou shalt speak unto him thus, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t: 'Thou art a stricken supplicant for righteousness, and a producer of lamentation for the souls of Tan<I>&acirc;</I>p&ucirc;har sinners</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A></p>  
<p>worthy of death;' for even so it is, and for this reason he becomes worthy of death, because the existence of the religion is known to him." 20. What I tell thee, <I>O</I> A&ucirc;rv&acirc;&icirc;t&acirc;-dang, <I>thou</I> T&ucirc;r <I>and</I> scanty giver! is that thou art a stricken supplicant <I>for</I> righteousness, a producer of lamentation for the souls of Tan<I>&acirc;</I>p&ucirc;har sinners worthy of death.'</p>  
<p>21. One prodigy of the demons is specified, who <I>was</I> the enemy of whatever sacred beings <I>there are</I>, a Karap, Va&ecirc;dv&ocirc;i<I>s</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <I>by</I> name, <I>of</I> those unsanctified (aya<I>s</I>t&acirc;n) <I>by</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 22. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'I so befriend that man, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! who is put forward by me over the creatures, whom thou shalt invite (khv&acirc;n&ecirc;<I>s</I>), I <I>who</I> am A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, because I am through righteousness opposed to harm (that is, through virtue I keep harm away from the creatures), <I>and</I> the archangels are opposed to harm. 23. Therefore do thou proceed, O Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! <I>and</I> thou shalt demand from him for me (that is, keep as my property) a hundred. youths of vigour (t&ocirc;sh tal)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, girls, and teams of four horses; so do thou speak to him thus: "<I>O</I> V&ecirc;dvo&icirc;<I>s</I>t! A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> demands from thee a hundred youths of vigour, girls, <I>and</I> teams of four horses; if thou givest <I>them</I>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to him, splendour and glory are thine through that giving; and if thou dost not give to him, evil destiny is thine through that not-giving."'</p>  
<p>24. Then Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t walked on to that V&ecirc;dvo&icirc;<I>s</I>t of those unsanctified, and spoke to him thus: '<I>O</I> V&ecirc;dvo&icirc;<I>s</I>t of the unsanctified! that <I>which</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> demands from thee is a hundred youths of vigour, girls, and teams of four horses if thou givest them to him, splendour <I>and</I> glory are thine through that giving; and if thou dost not give to him, evil destiny is thine through that not-giving.' 25. And that Karap shouted in reply <I>to</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t thus 'For me <I>there</I> is no more from thee (that is, there is no opulence for me from thy action), nor from A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; I am more of a divinity (bagtar) <I>and</I> am more forward in opulence than even A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; many droves of a thousand swine are also acquired by me.'</p>  
<p>26. On went Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, up to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> <I>and</I> up to the archangels, and Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t spoke thus: '<I>O</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, propitious spirit, creator of the world of embodied <I>beings, thou</I> righteous <I>one!</I> thus spoke he in reply to me: "For me <I>there</I> is no more from thee, nor from A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; I am more of a divinity than thee or even A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, and many droves of a thousand swine are acquired by me."'</p>  
<p>27. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'Owing to the splendour and glory of those which are ours, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! that man has acquired arrogance (that is, the cattle we produced are the many cattle of his arrogance). 28. This <I>will be</I> his retribution for it then, however, when he does not reach further alive at the end of the third night&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; in that third night</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they <I>will</I> have stood aloof from alongside his life (that is, they <I>will</I> have stood away from assisting it); those seven of them who are radiant and bright-eyed (s<I>p</I>&ecirc;<I>d</I>&#335; d&ocirc;&icirc;sar) make him rush up on high, and up there on high <I>he</I> shall be fed upon mouldy bread (parn&acirc;n).'</p>  
<p>29. One <I>marvel</I> is the great healthfulness owing to the H&ocirc;m-water <I>and</I> the bringing of this <I>by</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t from the river D&acirc;&icirc;t&icirc;, which is manifested when Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc; <I>was</I> conveying <I>him</I> to the conference. 30. Just as is declared in the words of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t thus: 'For them is the H&ocirc;m-water which thou bringest, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! not for those demon-worshipping people <I>who</I> worship the demons, or for a satisfier of courtezans (<I>g</I>&ecirc;h-vi<I>g</I>&acirc;r); they shall sprinkle it on to that bull thou shalt bring forward, who is a four-year-old of exhausted vigour, black-haired and useful; <I>on</I> drinking up the water, that bull <I>will</I> become quite sound from that infirmity.'</p>  
<p>31. Thereupon, Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t went on first into the embodied existence, on which dwelt, at the end of Sag&acirc;st&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, that same Parsha<I>d</I> <I>whose</I> title was T&ocirc;<I>r</I>&acirc; (<I>the Bull</I>). 32. Parsha<I>d</I>-t&ocirc;<I>r</I>&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> also spoke to him</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thus: '<I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas! give me this H&ocirc;m-water which thou bringest.' 13. And Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t spoke thus: 'Do thou praise righteousness, <I>O</I> Parsha<I>d</I>-t&ocirc;<I>r</I>&acirc;! and scorn the demons; <I>also</I> utter the profession&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t among the iniquitous.' 34. <I>It was</I> praised by Parsha<I>d</I> t&ocirc;<I>r</I>&acirc;, and the demons were scorned by him; yet he did not speak among the iniquitous as to his accepting the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t. 35. Forward to him <I>came</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t at that praise of righteousness, for him <I>was</I> that H&ocirc;m-water which Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t brought; not for those demon-worshipping people <I>who</I> have worshipped the demons, <I>but</I> for that bull of his <I>which</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t brought forward, a four-year-old of exhausted vigour, black-haired and useful; owing to that bringing forward of the water, the bull became quite sound from that infirmity.</p>  
<p>36. One <I>marvel</I> is that which is declared regarding the rushing of the evil spirit for the slaughter of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, just as revelation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> mentions thus: 'From the northern quarter forth rushed the deadly evil spirit, and thus shouted he, astute in evil, the deadly evil spirit: "Rush on, <I>O</I> fiend! and destroy the righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t." 17. On to him they rushed, the fiend, the demon B&ucirc;<I>d</I>, and secret-moving Pestilence, the deceiver. 38. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t chanted aloud the Ahunavair; the fiend <I>was</I> confounded at that, and away they rushed, the demon B&ucirc;<I>d</I> and secret-moving Pestilence, the deceiver. 39. And the fiends shouted thus: "Thou art scornfully observing, <I>O</I> evil spirit! (that is, anything to the purpose thou</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A></p>  
<p>dost not thoroughly observe, and what thou orderest <I>us</I> to do is not possible); the death of him who is Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas is not contemplated by us." 40. Owing to the full glory of the righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, he perceived in <I>his</I> mind thus: "The wicked demons, astute in evil, consult together about my death;" and up stood Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, forth went Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t.' 41. Here is manifested a great wonder to the multitude, in that which is mentioned thus: 'And a stone <I>was</I> put forth by the righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, <I>that</I> was held in <I>his</I> hand, and the size of a hut, <I>and</I> which was obtained by him from the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, the spiritual Yath&acirc;-ah&ucirc;-vairy&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>42. And one <I>marvel</I> is this which is manifested not only in the country of Ir&acirc;n to Ir&acirc;nians, but in every land and to every race: the shattering of the demons&#8217; bodies <I>through</I> the chanting of the Ahunavair aloud <I>by</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t. 43. Just as that which <I>a passage</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> mentions thus: 'I worship the resources of the Kay&acirc;n glory, with which the righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t was associated in thinking about, speaking about, <I>and</I> acting about the religion which was, of all embodied existences, the most righteous in righteousness, the most lordly in sovereignty, the most radiant in radiance, and the most glorious in glory. 44. At <I>his</I> appearance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the demons have fallen before him, at <I>his</I> appearance their semen (m&acirc;yag&acirc;n) also drops, at <I>his</I> appearance the courtezan is also withdrawn by them from mankind;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A></p>  
<p>on hearing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> him <I>they</I> lamented, very violently is it lamented by the demons. 45. By the Ahunavair, which the righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t chanted aloud to them, all the demons are seized <I>and</I> buried in the earth, where the complete shattering of their bodies is manifest.' 46. So that, after the shattering of their bodies, it became evident to those in the world <I>that</I> they were not able to do mischief in the bodily form of a demon, and they have been declared of the nature of sacred beings to mankind, <I>but</I> mankind fully understood that they are not sacred beings, but demons.</p>  
<p>47. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t revealed (gush&ucirc;ft&#335;) to mankind by the word of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, how in this religion <I>the latter</I> tells in words to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t where <I>and</I> how, in the embodied existence, mankind consider a demon as exalted <I>or</I> as a high-priest, because they are where they say that they must consider <I>some one</I> as high-priest. 48. So A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke <I>to</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t thus: 'How do they who are good people, O Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! consider a demon as exalted? and how are they that even tell a demon thus "We should accept you," because the demons speak thus: "It <I>will</I> happen to you"?'</p>  
<p>49. And Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t spoke thus: 'Only for the <I>reason</I>, O A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>! <I>that</I> people hasten on to that which is a jungly plain without dwellings, where no one resides from the departure of light until sunrise</p>

<p>arrives, when <I>it is</I> two H&acirc;sars&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of night, and again silently (ag&ocirc;p) from sunset until their returning together when the two H&acirc;sars of night are gone, they hear that no work, no men, and no voices of dogs are there. 50. Then they say as to that, on arriving back, thus: "We have consulted with the demons there; when we request (z&acirc;&ecirc;m) monarchy (s&acirc;st&acirc;r&icirc;h) <I>and</I> leadership from them, they give them to us; when we request the possession of flocks and opulence from them, they give them to us."'</p>  
<p>51. <I>Then A&ucirc;ha</I>r<I>ma</I>z<I></I>d<I> spoke thus:</I> 'How can they do such a thing for them, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! (that is, how does it happen <I>that it is</I> continually given by them <I>for</I> those that speak thus: "It happened to us")?'</p>  
<p>52. And Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t spoke thus: 'They speak variously, <I>O</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>! as to that generosity; there is <I>one</I> who speaks thus: "I have ever after been possessing more flocks, so long as I am <I>in</I> consultation with the demons;" and there is <I>another</I> who speaks thus: "I have ever after been worse and more ill-fated, so long as we are <I>in</I> consultation with those demons;" according as they possess a full subsistence for them<I>selves</I> from the demons (that is, when they diversely subsist fully <I>on</I> whatever they bespeak from the demons).' 53. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t also spoke thus: 'So they speak about it, <I>O</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>! thus: "Observe further, where any one of us returns <I>he</I> is either shrunk together (that is, he holds <I>his</I> head down to <I>his</I> chest), or shrunk away (that is, he looks quite aside), or is only pleasantly</p>

<p>cast down and, owing to acquiescence in him, the demons tempt (nes,h&ucirc;nd) <I>him</I> away out of mankind."'</p>  
<p>54. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'According to thy wish, do thou, O Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! fully observe thy existence, upwards from the head, downwards from the sole&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the foot, and afar <I>on</I> various sides; and thou shouldst beseech before and behind and <I>in</I> every direction, for we <I>are</I> not as to thee as the demons <I>are</I> as to mankind, we give away everything only in invisibility; but the demons, through close connection, when they rush out, tempt only with pleasantness. 55. Even unto thee, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! a fiend <I>will</I> rush, a female, golden-bodied <I>and</I> full-bosomed (so that she wears a bodice), and she rushes to request companionship from thee; a female, golden bodied <I>and</I> full-bosomed, to request conversation from thee, to request co-operation from thee. 56. <I>But</I> thou shouldst not grant her companionship, nor conversation, nor shalt thou prescribe <I>any</I> conduct for her; afterwards, to revert her downwards, thou shalt utter aloud that triumphant saying the Yath&acirc;-ah&ucirc;-vairy&ocirc;.'</p>  
<p>57. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t proceeded to the habitable <I>and</I> friendly world, for the purpose of fully observing that beaten track (kh<I>&acirc;</I>pisn&#335;) of the embodied existence; then that fiend came forward when he sat in the vicinity of a garment&#8212;that garment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> which, when Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc; <I>was</I> conveying <I>him</I> to the conference, <I>was</I> deposited by him&#8212;a female, golden-bodied <I>and</I> full-bosomed, and companionship, conversation,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and co-operation <I>were</I> requested by her from him; she also whined (dand&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;): 'I am Spenda<I>r</I>ma<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>58. And Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t spoke thus: 'She who is Spenda<I>r</I>ma<I>d</I> <I>was</I> fully observed by me in the light of a cloudless day, and that Spenda<I>r</I>ma<I>d</I> appeared <I>to</I> me fine behind and fine before and fine all round (that is, <I>in</I> all positions she was handsome); do thou turn <I>thy</I> back, <I>and</I> I <I>shall</I> know if thou art Spenda<I>r</I>ma<I>d</I>.'</p>  
<p>59. And the fiend spoke to him thus: 'O Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas! where we are, those who are females are handsome in front, <I>but</I> frightfully hideous behind; <I>so</I> do not make a demand for my back.' 60. After she <I>had</I> protested a third <I>time</I>, the fiend turned <I>her</I> back, and she was seen by Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t behind in the groin; and when matter was exuded, <I>it was</I> full of serpents, toads, lizards, centipedes, and frogs.</p>  
<p>61. And that triumphant saying, the Yath&acirc;-ah&ucirc;-vairy&ocirc;, was uttered aloud by Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t; then that fiend <I>was</I> annihilated, and <I>K</I>&ecirc;shmak&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the Karap rushed forth. 62. And he grumbled in leaving, thus: 'The misery which is here <I>below</I> is such as I have obtained, because, owing to thee, I thought that thy sacred beings <I>were</I> more joyful than any heroes who through defeat go to hell; I proceed more joyfully <I>than</I> the sacred beings, as regards the life in the body, so that I fully deceive the life in thy body, and thou art fully deceived by me as regards thine.'</p>

<p><A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A></p>  
<p>63. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t also revealed (gush&ucirc;ft&#335;) this secret to mankind, and their knowledge <I>how</I> to test a demon is manifested therein, even by a great wonder of the same nature to mankind: the visible rushing of the demons into the world before Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, <I>and</I> their bodies <I>being</I> afterwards shattered by the loud chanting of revelation <I>by</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t from the Avesta announced, which <I>was</I> the acceptance of <I>its</I> truth by the ruler Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp and the people of that time; and if this <I>had</I> not been so, <I>and</I> Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp <I>and</I> those of <I>his</I> time <I>were</I> not accepting the Avesta which <I>was</I> announced by <I>Zarat&ucirc;</I>s<I>t in</I> this fashion, through <I>their</I> considering <I>it</I> false, it would not have reached unto us.</p>  
<p>64. One <I>marvel</I> is this, with which, too, he who <I>was</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t became aware from revelation, about the vileness <I>and</I> perverted religion of Z&acirc;k of the deadly Karaps of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp and many other Ka&icirc;s and Karaps who <I>were</I> at the residence of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, their combination for the death of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, the preparation for severe abuse of him to Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, and influencing Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp for his death by command of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, <I>which</I> extends to awful imprisonment and punishment. 65. Afterwards, too, <I>his</I> knowledge about his preservation therefrom, the manifestation of his wondrousness, and the evidence concerning <I>his</I> attainment unto prophesying; <I>also</I> after the continuance <I>of</I> the last questioning of the ten years of conference, <I>his</I> departure alone, by the advice <I>and</I> command of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, to the residence of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp and the precinct (var) of that terrible conflict. 66. <I>His</I> uttering, on the horse-course (asp&acirc;nvar) of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, a reminder of the power and triumph of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> over himself, <I>as</I> he invited Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp to</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the religion of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; and with great wisdom Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp heard the words of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, on account of his own complete mindfulness and spiritual knowledge of ritual, <I>and</I> would have asked for an outpouring of prophecy.</p>  
<p>67. <I>But</I> thereupon, too&#8212;before the words of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t <I>were fully</I> heard by him, <I>and</I> he could have understood the character of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&#8212;owing to the demonizing of the deadly Z&acirc;k and the rest <I>of</I> those K&icirc;gs <I>and</I> Karaps, <I>spoken</I> out with slanderous knowledge <I>and</I> perverse actions to Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp about Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, <I>there</I> then <I>occurred</I> his consignment of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t to that confinement <I>and</I> punishment as stated in the words of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t thus: 'I have spoken about their three enquiries, and I am bound by thirty of them, I with thirty-three fetters of murderers, wicked ones, and demon-worshippers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 68. But the hunger of manhood's inclination&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> violently affected the strength of my legs, but the hunger of manhood's inclination violently affected the force of my arms, but the hunger of manhood's inclination violently affected the hearing of my ears, but the hunger of manhood's inclination violently affected the sight of my eyes, and it would force away my bosom up to <I>my</I> back (so that it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> would stay behind at my back) through the continuance of that deadly hunger of manhood's inclination.'</p>  
<p>69. And here, through the mightiness of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&#8212;<I>who</I> proceeded alone to the terrible combat <I>with</I>&nbsp;</p>

<p>evil, where <I>there</I> became manifest, in the mode which is written, the descent of his life into so much punishment, due to hunger and thirst, heavy fetters, <I>and</I> other misery unto which the strength of human nature is attaining, <I>but</I> unto which <I>it</I> is not destined&#8212;is manifested a great wonder to king Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp and his officials, when <I>his</I> full-glorious person <I>was</I> found by them alive in awfulness, imprisonment, and those other transformations (pa<I>d</I>gastak&icirc;h) of long-continued starvation.</p>  
<p>70. One <I>marvel</I> is this, that the sacred beings contrived, for the sake of (va<I>l</I> vah&acirc;n-&icirc;) his preservation from that awfulness, a body possessing life, <I>and</I> on his account it became lifeless and imperceptible; afterwards, in the great session of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp and the assembly of the world, Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, through the strength and blessedness of the true word, restored the same body anew, like that which is issuing in the statement of the wonder about the splendid horse of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>71. One <I>marvel</I> is <I>his</I> telling and disclosing the thoughts of king Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp and <I>of</I> those of the realm, and many other concealed matters, through spiritual perception.</p>  
<p>72. One <I>marvel</I> is several matters of evil deceit (va<I>d</I> <I>g</I>am&acirc;s) which Dah&acirc;k had done in B&acirc;p&ecirc;l&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p>through witchcraft, <I>and</I> mankind had come to idol-worship through that seduction, <I>and its</I> increase was the destruction of the world; <I>but</I> through the triumphant words of the religion, which Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t proclaimed opposing it, that witchcraft is all dissipated and disabled.</p>  
<p>73. One <I>marvel</I> is this which is manifested, with wonders owing to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, in controversy about the religion with the famous learned of the realm, among whom, known for learning in the world, <I>are</I> the investigators (gir&acirc;yag&acirc;n&#335;). of the words of speech; <I>and</I> among those <I>things</I> which <I>are</I> more surprisingly controversial <I>are</I> those later (sibastar) words which <I>are</I> to save their creatures by a later religion. 74. Also to proclaim its truth intelligibly, and to make king Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp <I>and</I> those previously learned <I>men</I> without doubt as to the truth of the religion, the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> sends some <I>spirits</I>, Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc;, Ashavahi<I>s</I>t&ocirc;, and the propitious fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, as a reminder to Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp about the true prophesying of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, <I>and</I> the desire of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> for the acceptance of the religion <I>of</I> Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship <I>by</I> Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp <I>and for its</I> propagation in the world.</p>  
<p>75. The wondrousness which is manifested to Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp <I>and</I> those of the realm&#8212;both through the travelling (v<I>&acirc;</I><I>z</I>&icirc;<I>d</I>an&#335;) of those archangels down from the sky to the earth, and in <I>their</I> travelling to the abode of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp&#8212;<I>was</I> like this which revelation mentions thus: &#8216;Then he who is the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke <I>to</I> them, to Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc;, Ashavahi<I>s</I>t&ocirc;, and also the fire of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, the propitious, thus: "Proceed! you <I>who</I> are archangels, unto the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A></p>  
<p>abode of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, whose resources (<I>a</I>fz&acirc;r) are cattle <I>and</I> who is far <I>and</I> widely famed, with a view to <I>his</I> reliance upon this religion (that is, till he shall stand up for this religion); and, as regards the answering words of the righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas, to approve the nature (zag <I>s</I>&acirc;n) of those words." 76. The archangels proceeded unto the abode of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, whose resources are cattle <I>and who</I> is far <I>and</I> widely famed; their radiance, in that lofty residence, seemed to him, that Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, a heaven <I>of</I> complete light, owing to their great power and triumph; this <I>was</I> so that, when he thus looked upon it, the exalted Ka&icirc;-Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp trembled, all his courtiers (p&ecirc;<I>s</I>ak&#335;) trembled, all his chieftains (pa<I>d</I>&#335;) were confused, <I>and</I> he of the superior class <I>was</I> like the driver of a chariot-horse.</p>  
<p>77. &#8216;And the fire of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke, in the words of heroes, thus: &#8220;Fear not, for <I>there</I> is no fearing for thee, <I>thou</I> exalted Ka&icirc;-Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp! they have not come for alarming thy abode, <I>as</I> a reminder of the deputed envoys of Ar<I>g</I>&acirc;sp&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; <I>there</I> have not come, for alarming thy abode, the two Khy&ocirc;ns of</p>

We are three who have come over (tarist&#335;) to thy abode, Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc;, Ashavahi<I>s</I>t&ocirc;, and also the fire of the propitious lord; of these thy knowledge is most wisely most just. 79. If thou helpest vision, so that it becomes wisdom for thee, the worldly <I>existence</I> requires the good religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers, which proceeds purely through the recitation which Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas <I>teaches</I>. 80.
