<p>1. About his diverse want of participation (gv&icirc;<I>d</I> akhv&ecirc;<I>s</I>&icirc;h) with <I>his</I> parents this also is declared, that the demons, at an assembly of wizards, produced an outcry <I>for</I> a conference (ham-v&acirc;<I>k</I>&ocirc; l&acirc;yi<I>s</I>n&#335;) thus: 'That son of P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc; is senseless and foolish <I>and</I> secretly corrupted; no one, man <I>or</I> woman, <I>will</I> consider <I>or</I> accept <I>him</I> as exalted.'</p>  
<p>2. The tidings came to P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc;, and P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc; spoke unto Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t thus: 'I thought that I <I>had</I> begotten a son who <I>would</I> become a priest, a warrior, and a husbandman, and now thou</p>

<p><A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A></p>  
<p>wouldst be foolish and secretly corrupted; thou shouldst proceed to the Karaps, so that they may cure <I>thee</I>.'</p>  
<p>3. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t gave answer thus: 'I <I>am he</I> that is thy son, a priest, warrior, and husbandman.' 4. And, by command of P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc; he harnessed two horses to a chariot (var<I>d</I>&icirc;n&#335;), and he went with P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc;.</p>  
<p>5. When they came to the place according to the decision of P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc;, into the presence of one Karap of those said five brethren, that wizard took a cup and made water, and spoke thus: 'This he should drink who is a son of thine, so that he <I>may</I> become well;' and he acted with this conviction, that so he would change to the same nature as theirs.</p>  
<p>6. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t spoke to P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc; thus: 'Thou mayst give <I>it</I> back to him who is thy protector <I>and</I> high-priest;' and he arose (&acirc;kh&ecirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;d)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_458"></A><A HREF="#fn_454"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and went back to <I>their</I> place.</p>  
<p>7. On the way, Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t gave <I>their</I> two horses water, on account of <I>their</I> thirst; and he thought thus: 'Unprofitable was my going to the residence of the Karaps, except <I>in</I> this manner, when, through giving water to the horses, my soul <I>was</I> then expanded.'</p>
