<p>1. About the righteousness of his desires <I>it</I> is thus declared, that when he became fifteen years old, the sons of P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc; demanded a portion from <I>their</I> father, and their portions are allotted out by him. 2. Among the clothes <I>there</I> was a girdle, the width of which <I>was</I> four finger<I>-breadths</I>; and of the four&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> portions around and the girdle, which it was possible to bring forth, Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t selected <I>the latter</I> and tied it on him<I>self</I>. 3. This was owing to the precepts (parv&acirc;nak&acirc;n) of Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc; who came into his reason at birth; as to whatever is not the custom <I>his</I> mind <I>was</I> now quite closed, and in that which is the custom <I>it was</I> impetuously exercised by him.</p>  
<p>4. About <I>his</I> compassionate disposition and the streams of the Arag province&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, this also is declared,</p>

<p>that <I>there</I> was a river, <I>and</I> from them the body of a naked woman floated, for the reason that, on account of the strength and swiftness of the river, a woman, except when she <I>was</I> quite naked while she was in it, was not able to pass; and an old person, such as he who is of seventy years <I>and</I> is called in revelation a H&acirc;n&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_461"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for want of power (ap&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;y&acirc;vand&icirc;h r&acirc;&icirc;), was not able to go back through it by his own strength. 5. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t came on to the bank of the water, <I>and</I> of women <I>and</I> old people seven persons had come, and are passed on by him, <I>in</I> the manner of a bridge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; it was an emblem of the <I>spiritual</I> performers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_467"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of bridging work, that is, of those providing a passage to heaven.</p>  
<p>6. About his liberal disposition <I>it</I> is declared, that the fodder of P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc;, which was stored for the beasts <I>of burden</I>, <I>was</I> not <I>only</I> for the beasts of P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc; in a scarcity, but <I>also</I> for distribution among the beasts of others, which, owing to their hunger on account of the scarcity, then constantly ate off the tails of each other; <I>and it was</I> given to them plentifully.</p>  
<p>7. About his abandoning worldly desire, <I>and</I> his laying hold of righteousness of way, this, too, is declared, that when he became twenty years old, without the consent (<I>b</I>&ecirc;n ak&acirc;mak&icirc;h) of <I>his</I> father and mother, he wandered forth <I>and</I> departed from</p>

<p><I>their</I> house, and openly enquired thus: 'Who is most desirous of righteousness <I>and</I> most nourishing the poor?' 8. And they spoke thus: 'He who is the youngest (k&ecirc;hist&ocirc;) son of A&ucirc;rva&icirc;t&#335;-dih&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_468"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the T&ucirc;r, who every day gives an iron caldron (<I>g</I>&acirc;mak), which is the height of a horse, full of bread and milk <I>and</I> other food, unto the poor.' 9. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t went on to that place, and with his co-operation, for the nourishment of the poor, some of the chief men performed duty by carrying forth food for the poor.</p>  
<p>to. About his compassion, not only upon mankind, but also his other creatures, this, too, is declared, that a bitch <I>was</I> seen by him, which had given birth to five&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="#fn_465"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> puppies, and it was three days then that she <I>had</I> not obtained food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_470"></A><A HREF="#fn_466"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 11. Whomever she saw, she then advanced her mouth towards him, and became as it were prostrated; Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t provided a remedy, <I>by</I> swiftly bringing up bread for her, <I>but</I> when <I>he was</I> bringing it she had expired.</p>  
<p>12. About his own desire for the good quality&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_471"></A><A HREF="#fn_467"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of a wife, on account also of the will of <I>his</I> parents, <I>and his</I> not mingling his own seed before a suitable obtainment, this, too, is declared, that when his father sought a wife for him, Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t argued with the bride (n&ecirc;sh<I>&acirc;</I>) thus: 'Show me thy face, so that I may find out (barkh&acirc;m) its kind of appearance, <I>and</I> this, too, whether its appearance <I>be</I> undesirable, or shall not be gratifying;' and the bride turned away her face from him. 13. And Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t spoke thus:</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 'Whoever takes away a sight from me, does not practise respect for me.'</p>  
<p>14. About his <I>having</I> accepted progress even from the iniquitous, <I>that</I> listened sinfully desirous, who accepted so much advantageousness as <I>was</I> manifest, this, too, is declared, that he came into an assembly who were well known in the place for much knowledge, and he enquired of them thus: 'What is most favourable for the soul?' 15. And they spoke thus: 'To nourish the poor, to give fodder to cattle, to bring firewood to the fire, to pour H&ocirc;m juice into water, and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_472"></A><A HREF="sbe4729.htm#fn_468"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to worship many demons with words, with the words which are called revelation (d&ecirc;n&ocirc;).' 16. Then Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t nourished the poor, foddered the cattle, brought firewood to the fire, and squeezed H&ocirc;m into water, <I>but</I> never are any demons whatever worshipped with words <I>by</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t.</p>

XX, 8 we are told that 'the Arang river is that of which <I>it</I> is said that it comes out from Alb&ucirc;r<I>z</I> in the land of S&ucirc;rak, which they call also Sham (Shim); and it passes on through the land of &Ecirc;gipt&ocirc;s, which they call also Misr, and there they call it the swift river &Ecirc;gipit&ocirc;is.' It is <A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A> one of the two mythical rivers which were supposed to bound the Ir&acirc;nian world, and seems to represent the Aras as a northern and the Nile as a western boundary.
