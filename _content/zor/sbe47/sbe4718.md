### CHAPTER III.

1\. About that which is manifested as regards the propitiousness,
forward intellect, and complete virtue of Zaratû*s*t, it is openly
declared that, according to his explaining statements, *there occurred
such events* as the victory of Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp and the Irânians over
Ar*g*âsp <span id="fr_374"></span>[1](#fn_370) and an army of Khyôns and
other foreigners *of* innumerable kinds, *and* details on that subject;
also other assistance of Vi*s*tâsp and those of the realm in other
necessities.

2\. The killing of Zaratû*s*t himself *by* Brâ*d*rô-rêsh <span
id="fr_375"></span>[2](#fn_371) the Tûr; the provision of a chariot *by*
Srîtô <span id="fr_376"></span>[3](#fn_372) of the Vîsraps; and whatever
is on those subjects.

3\. Also, specially, matters in the times to come, each consecutively,
*when* therein arrive devastators *such* as Alexander <span
id="fr_377"></span>[4](#fn_373), and the killer of Akrê-khira*d*ŏ <span
id="fr_378"></span>[5](#fn_374), Mahrkûs <span
id="fr_379"></span>[6](#fn_375), Dahâk <span
id="fr_380"></span>[7](#fn_376), and other devastators; extenders of
belief (vîravî*s*n-vâlân) *such* as the Messiah (Mashikh), Mânih <span
id="fr_381"></span>[8](#fn_377), and others; periods *such* as the steel
*age* <span id="fr_382"></span>[9](#fn_378), *that* mingled with iron,
and others; and organizers, restorers, *and* introducers of religion,
*such*

as A*r*takhshatar <span id="fr_383"></span>[1](sbe4719.htm#fn_379),
Âtû*r*pâ*d* <span id="fr_384"></span>[2](sbe4719.htm#fn_380),
Khûsrôî <span id="fr_385"></span>[3](sbe4719.htm#fn_381),
Pêshyôtan <span id="fr_386"></span>[4](sbe4719.htm#fn_382), Aûshê*d*ar,
Aûshê*d*ar-mâh, Sôshâns <span
id="fr_387"></span>[5](sbe4719.htm#fn_383), and others.

4\. The formation of custom, and the indications which *have* come to
manifestation and *will* arrive at various periods; and the proclamation
of these, too, by *G*âmâsp <span
id="fr_388"></span>[6](sbe4719.htm#fn_384), from the teaching of
Zaratû*s*t, is what he wrote, together with the Avesta and Zand, upon
oxhides, and it was written *with* gold, and kept in the royal
treasury <span id="fr_389"></span>[7](sbe4719.htm#fn_385). 5. And it was
from it the high-priests of the rulers made many copies and afterwards,
too, it is from it that it happened, both to the less intelligent and
the corrupters, that *they* were introducing different opinions *and*
different views.
