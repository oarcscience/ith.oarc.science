<p>1. About the marvellousness which is manifested and is openly specified after the collapsing of the sovereignty of Ir&acirc;n <I>and</I> the country of Ir&acirc;n; <I>also</I> the end of the millennium of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t and the arrival of A&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar the descendant of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>2. There is this marvellousness, really overthrowing the blessedness of the knowledge of former government, revealed by the Avesta about the ninth and tenth centuries, that which is an indicator of circumstances (a&ecirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;n&#335;&icirc;h) now visible, <I>such</I> as the dispersion of the sovereignty of Ir&acirc;n from the country of Ir&acirc;n, the disturbance of just law <I>and</I> custom, the predominance of <I>those with</I> dishevelled hair&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> the haughty profession of ecclesiastics&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Also the collection and even connection of all their four systems of belief (v<I>&acirc;</I><I>v</I>ar&icirc;-hastan&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> together</p>

<p>for the upper rank; the coming of <I>one</I> working with the sacred beings to the inferior, the transient, and the captive of the period; and the dispersion and downfall of dependent and public men in their time.</p>  
<p>4. The disappearance of a disposition for wisdom from the foreigners <I>in</I> the countries of Ir&acirc;n, which is an indication of shame <I>at</I> the truth of the religion, and <I>at</I> the praise, peace, liberality, and other goodness whose provision <I>has</I> lodgement in a disposition for wisdom. 5. Also the abundance <I>of</I> the decisions of apostasy, the falsehood, deceit, slander, quarrelsomeness, fraudulence, ingratitude, discord, stinginess, and other vileness whose real connection is a disposition to devour, neglecting heedfulness for the archangels of fire, water, and worldly <I>existence</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 6. The oppressiveness of infidelity <I>and</I> idol-worship, the scarcity <I>of</I> freedom, the extreme predominance of avarice in the individuals (tan&#335;) of mankind, the plenitude of different opinions about witchcraft, <I>and</I> the much inclination of many for paralyzing the religion of the sacred beings.</p>  
<p>7. The annihilation of the sovereignty of mankind one over the other, the desolation of localities and settlements by severe actual distress, and the evil foreign potentates who <I>are</I>, one after the other, scattering the valiant; the destruction among cattle <I>and</I> the defilement <I>of</I> the spirit of enjoyment, owing to the lodgement of lamentation and weeping <I>in</I> the countries of Ir&acirc;n, the clamour of the demon-worshipper in the country, <I>and</I> the unobtainable stature, non-existent strength, blighted destiny, and short</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A></p>  
<p>life of mankind. 8. Also the abundance of ordinances (&acirc;yin&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of various descriptions, the approval of the apostate among tyrants and the non-approval of the Zoti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who is well-disposed and wise, the coming of the Zoti to want, <I>and</I> all the other adversity, disruption, and running astray which <I>are</I> over-powering even in districts <I>and</I> localities of the countries of Ir&acirc;n.</p>  
<p>9. The maintenance of no ritual (<I>a</I>pand&icirc;h) of the religion of the sacred beings; the weakness, suffering, and evil habits of those <I>of</I> the good religion; the lamentation and recantation (kh&ucirc;st&ucirc;k&icirc;h) of the upholders of the religion; <I>and</I> the wickedness and extermination of good works in most of the countries of Ir&acirc;n. to. Also much other misery in these two centuries is recounted in the Avesta, which passed away with them and is also now so visible therein, and manifestly occurs in them.</p>  
<p>11. This, too, is a statement (nisang-1) as to them, <I>which</I> revelation mentions thus: 'That is the age mingled with iron (that is, from every side they perceive <I>it is</I> of iron) in which they bring forth into life him who is a sturdy praying apostate. 12. This is their sturdiness, that their approval is unobservant of both doctrines (&acirc;&icirc;nak&#335;); and this is their praying, that whenever <I>it is</I> possible for them they shall cause misery to others; <I>also</I> when an old man publicly advances into a crowd (galak&#335;) of youths, owing to the evil times in which that man who is learned is born, they are unfriendly <I>to him</I> (that is, they are no friends of the high-priests of the priestly assembly). 13. They are freely speaking (that is,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they utter phrases smoothly), they are wicked and are fully maliciously talking, so that they shall make the statements of priests and high-priests useless; they also tear asunder the spiritual lordship <I>and</I> priestly authority, and shall bring the ruler <I>and</I> priestly authority into evil behaviour as vicious, but they bring together those <I>who are</I> singular. 14. Anything they say is always mischief (ag&icirc;h), and that district which had a judge they cast into the smiting precinct, into hell; it is misery without any intermission they shall inflict therein, till they attain unto damnation (darvand&icirc;h) through the recitation they persevere in, <I>both</I> he who is the evil progeny disseminated by the apostate <I>and</I> he who is the villainous wolf full of disaster <I>and</I> full of depravity.'</p>  
<p>15. 'Here <I>below</I> they fight, the friend with him who is a friend, they also defraud (z&icirc;v&ecirc;nd) him of his own work (that is, whenever it is possible for them, they shall seize upon his property), and they give it to him from whom they obtain prosperity in return; if not, they seek him who is acting as a confederate (nish&icirc;n-g&ucirc;n), and they make that other <I>one</I> defraud the poor <I>man</I> (so that they shall seize upon his property); they also cheat him when he shall make complaint. 16. I <I>shall</I> not again produce such for thee, no friend here for him who is a friend, no brother for him who is a brother, no son for him who is a father, nor yet a father <I>for</I> him who is a son; admonished, <I>but</I> not convinced, they become the abode of the will of the place, so that they subsist in every single place where it is necessary for them <I>to be</I>, in each that is necessary for them they march on together, and on the way they reflect upon the path of blessedness and the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A></p>  
<p>manifold learning they utter owing to knowledge of me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>17. 'These three, our increase, learning, <I>and</I> reward, we fully understand through the ascendancy <I>of</I> him who is ignoble, <I>and</I> through the downfall <I>of</I> him who is noble <I>and</I> superior to him of little thorough instruction who, in every thing, <I>will</I> be at the foot of the tyrant. 18. Thinking of a priest <I>one</I> becomes spiritual, thinking of a tyrant one becomes a Kav&icirc;g&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; a demon <I>in</I> disposition is an incipient demon, a Kav&icirc;g <I>in</I> disposition is himself attracted towards a youth.'</p>  
<p>19. Then, when character and wisdom recede from the countries of Ir&acirc;n (that is, they depart), so <I>that</I> destitution and also winter, produced by demons who are worshipping the demon, rush together from the vicinity of disaster (v&ocirc;ighn) on to the countries of Ir&acirc;n, where even rain becomes scanty and pestilence is secretly advancing and deceiving, so that deaths become numerous; thus even <I>he</I> of perverted wisdom, who is wicked, and the apostate also, who is unrighteous, rush together in companionship. 20. As what <I>one</I> says they <I>all</I> exclaim thus: 'Consume and destroy, <I>O</I> ruler! for <I>it</I> is to be consumed and destroyed by thee; destroy even the fire, consume even as food those who are the protection of the association enforcing <I>religious</I> obedience, and those leading on the poor <I>man</I> of the righteous dispensation by their guidance.' 21. So that they shall make him thoroughly detached and smite him;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A></p>  
<p>likewise wisdom is the wealth they bring him, <I>and</I> it is when property is being carried off by them, <I>that</I> the wisdom conveyed by them arises.</p>  
<p>22. 'And in that age, <I>O</I> righteous <I>one of</I> the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas! the coming of my desire is not purely for thee, nor is a thorough belief <I>of</I> the departure of life, so that the bringing <I>and</I> conducting of a speaker of promises (mit<I>r</I>ag&ocirc;v) is not necessary; those of the perfect apostate injure this discourse of thine, the Avesta and Zand, so that they shall make <I>it</I> thoroughly weak; <I>and</I> those of the perfect apostate harass their own souls, for love of the wealth which he produced.'</p>  
<p>23. And about the ninth and tenth centuries this also it says, that, '<I>as</I> that age proceeds, this is what occurs, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas! when many apostates utter the righteousness of priestly instruction and authority, <I>which</I> is wickedness towards me, they cause begging for water, they wither vegetation, and they put down all excellence which is due to the manifestation of righteousness.'</p>  
<p>24. Again Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t enquired of him thus: 'What do they so produce by that, <I>O</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>! when they cause begging for water, they wither vegetation, and they put down all excellence due to the manifestation of righteousness?' 25. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'They so produce those <I>things</I> among them, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! when they mention a greater reward for bantlings <I>and</I> relations than that of their own souls (that is, they talk more concerning their allowance, where it is that for their own). 26. Moreover, they give to the K&icirc;gs <I>and</I> Karaps, for some repute <I>with</I> the shepherd people of the husbandman, and with the swift-horsed people <I>of</I> the warrior, as</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A></p>  
<p>though they would provide us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> here <I>below</I> with a large share of meat, that they would make our privilege, just as we&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> here supply him with meat whom we render greatly precious. 27. The property <I>of</I> even a wicked <I>man</I> here <I>below</I>, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! in the average opinion among the disorganized (an&acirc;r&acirc;st&acirc;n&#335;) is a dignified provision (that is, we form a strong opinion, the approval <I>of which</I> is more to be asserted as <I>being</I> the opinion of a poor righteous <I>man</I>, about a worthy righteous <I>man</I> whose manifest righteousness is a homage (fran&acirc;mi<I>s</I>n&#335;) to duty <I>and</I> good works).'</p>  
<p>28. Again he enquired of him thus: 'Is there so perfect a manifestation here <I>below</I>, in the age of the worldly existence of the religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers (that is, is there a lodgement of the religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers in any one)?' 29. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'It is so, among those men of mine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! for here <I>below there</I> are priests who are eloquent, and they, too, are men voluble and requisite in the embodied existence, all-beneficent and producing the destruction <I>of</I> harm and the wizard; the people of the wicked tyrant say also regarding them, <I>that</I>, excepting thee, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! they rightly practise righteousness more largely, more powerfully, <I>and</I> more volubly. 30. Blind are those <I>of</I> the fiend, who are consulting with thee and are unaware of the tyrant; and observant are also those <I>of</I> the fiend who consult with them and think of <I>their</I> intelligence, and oppose the imbecile (an&acirc;k&acirc;s&icirc;h-a&ucirc;m&ocirc;nd) apostate who is near them, so that</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_101"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 101</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they say&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> this, namely: "<I>As to</I> this which thou tellest us, <I>it</I> is evidently not so as thou sayest," of which they speak thus: "This duty of thy man is not mine (that is, it is not necessary for me to perform) nor thine (that is, it is not necessary even <I>for</I> thee to perform), because <I>it</I> is not this which is righteousness (that is, not a good work)." 31. For this <I>one</I> is produced for these words <I>and</I> thoughts of thine, <I>of</I> whom thou, too, art aware, he who is whatever is here <I>below</I> of A&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of thoughtful controversy, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas! for he brings into notice, through the intermingling of his own soul, <I>him</I> who is righteous, or has not become <I>so</I>.'</p>  
<p>32. This, too, he says, namely: '<I>Of</I> those, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas! who come in the ninth and tenth centuries, I tell thee that they are <I>of</I> the fiend <I>of</I> Greed (&Acirc;z&icirc;); it is in <I>her</I> womb that they are to be fashioned, they who assist those who would be vicious, through pre-eminence in leader-ship, or through excellence in subserviency.'</p>  
<p>33. And this, too, it says about them: 'Those men are much to be destroyed;' so it is said by A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> that 'these who are righteous, who carry away a corpse in this world, distress their fire, according to every high-priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and even long-flowing water; their bodies, which are really cesspools&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of a terrible character, become very assisting for the tormentors whose corpses are grievously wicked. 34. Concerning them I tell thee, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas! that, in the ninth and tenth centuries, <I>there</I> come those who are the brood of the fiend and the wound-producer (reshg&acirc;r)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the evil spirit; even one of them is more to be destroyed than ten demon-worshippers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; they also produce extermination for these who are mine, for these of my religion, whom they, call a provision for destruction (that is, when it is possible to live in our way, and <I>ours</I> are wicked, they diminish in superiority). 35. Even the iniquity that they shall commit in leadership and subserviency, the sin which is smiting thee, they call a trifle (khalak&#335;), <I>O</I> pure <I>one</I> of the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;mas! and the smiter, they say, is <I>he</I> whom these of thy religion of Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers smite. 36. Besides thee, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! they distress those <I>duties</I>, too, which <I>are</I> to be acquired <I>by</I> thy people (lag&acirc;n&#335;); they think scornfully of this ceremonial of thine, scornfully of <I>thy</I> worship, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! <I>and</I> they think scornfully of both the two blessed utterances&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the Avesta and Zand, which <I>were</I> proclaimed <I>to</I> thee <I>by</I> me who am the most propitious of spirits. 37. They foster villainous outrage, <I>and</I> they say the best work for mankind is immoderate fighting whose joyfulness is due to actions that are villainous; those, too, <I>that</I> they exterminate are the existences <I>due to</I> the spirits, they exterminate their own souls, they exterminate the embodied existences <I>of</I> the world; <I>and</I> they produce lamentation for the soul, and even the religion, as regards what is the mode of controlling orthodox people <I>together</I> with the iniquitous of the same period.'</p>  
<p>38. And this, too, it says, that Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t enquired</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> thus: 'So what <I>shall</I> we prescribe for those who are not capable, through <I>being</I> poor (that is, they have no means), nor have they troops, nor a protector over <I>them</I>, and they have many persecutors?' 39. <I>And</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'The strong-minded&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> man, through understanding, is a token of the development of those who, not being in the army, are capable; their persecutors also are many, and the passing over of authority is owing to the iniquitous of the same period.'</p>  
<p>40. This, too, it says, that Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t enquired thus: 'Is he, <I>O</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>! who is a Kai <I>or</I> a Karap, or he who is a most evil ruler in authority, mingled again with the good?' 41. <I>And</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'Even he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>42. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t <I>also</I> enquired thus: 'Is he, too, <I>O</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>! who is <I>one of</I> those of the good sovereignty, mingled again with the good; or these, <I>such</I> as the Ka&icirc;sar and Kh&acirc;k&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>?' 43. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'Even that <I>former</I>, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t!'</p>  
<p>44. About the same iniquitous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_291"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> this, too, he says, namely: &#8216;When they are aware and understand about the sayings (galimak&#335;) due to righteousness, they are pleased, so that a bribe seems better to them than duty and good works; they love the darkness <I>rather</I> than light, the existence they love</p>

<p><A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is the worst existence <I>rather</I> than the best existence, <I>and</I> they promote difficulty. 45. Concerning them, too, I tell thee that they are more to be destroyed than the leaping (shas<I>p</I>&#335;) serpent which is like a wolf <I>or</I> a lion, and they ever advance in malice <I>and</I> persecution from that <I>time</I> till when that man arrives who is Kitr&ocirc;-m&ecirc;h&ocirc;n&#335;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the righteous, with the victorious club. 46. He <I>has</I> marched with fifty triplets of men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who are disciples, powerful and tall, looking after duties and ordinances, wide-shouldered, stout-armed, <I>and</I> very hairy (kabed-mil&icirc;h), so that their appearance is rough and of a black colour&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_290"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, wherefore the demon and the iniquity <I>proceeding</I> from him fear them. 47. He also smites the evil spirit, <I>together</I> with <I>his</I> creatures; <I>and</I> those three manifest branches, that worship the fiend with simultaneous worship, are really these who march for eminent service on horses, even the Turkish demons with dishevelled hair; the Arab, and also She<I>d</I>&acirc;sp&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the ecclesiastical Ar&ucirc;man.</p>

<p>48. 'And he <I>has</I> then to attract men, contented and discontented, mostly through the incentive of duty; he who is not contented (that is, not agreeing with what he says) contentedly pays respect to him, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! (so that he brings him into the religion). 49. Likewise, through that club, he makes <I>one</I> press in the same manner; so that <I>one</I> is distressed by his hand to hold <I>others in</I> contempt, through the valiant arm and through the youthful bodily organs. 50. And he attaches power and triumph to his religion of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, and through that power and triumph they become ever respected thenceforth, when those arrive who are the sons of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, who shall pro-duce the renovation in an existence undecaying <I>and</I> immortal, hungerless and thirstless, the long-continued perpetuity including all.'</p>  
<p>51. And about the separation (bur&icirc;nak&#335;) of the ten centuries in the one millennium of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, <I>and</I> the tidings of A&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, son of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, it says also this, namely: 'When that century fully elapses which is the first of the religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers, from <I>the time when</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t came forward to <I>his</I> conference, what is the separation of <I>this</I> first century?' 52. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'The sun conceals <I>itself</I>' 53. 'What is the separation after the second, third, fourth, <I>fifth</I>, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, <I>or</I> tenth century?' 54. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'The sun conceals <I>itself</I>.'</p>

Then she sits in that water <I>and</I> drinks it, and she kindles in a high degree those germs which were the third <I>of</I> the last that the righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t <I>was</I> dropping forth originally, and they introduce that son whose name is the Developer <I>of</I> Righteousness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_299"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 57.

So, too, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! of them themselves, their declaration is thus, that they know that the separation of the millennium, which this religion <I>has</I> heard about by listening, is thus; <I>and</I> of those who do not even then know, that it is something which is different.</p>  
<p>60. Then, when that man becomes thirty years old, he confers with the archangels, the good rulers <I>and</I> good providers; <I>on</I> the morrow, in the daylight of the day, <I>it is</I> moreover manifest, when the <I>embodied</I> existence is thus undistressed&#8212;without</p>
