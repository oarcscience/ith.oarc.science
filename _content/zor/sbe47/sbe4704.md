### OBSERVATIONS.

1\. For all divisions into chapters and sections the translator is
chiefly responsible, as the stops found in the manuscripts are not used
systematically.

2\. Italics are used for any English words which are not expressed, or
fully understood, in the original text, but are added to complete the
sense of the translation.

3\. Italics occurring in Oriental words, or names, represent certain
peculiar Oriental letters (see the 'Transliteration of Oriental
Alphabets' at the end of this volume), or certain abbreviated modes of
writing Pahlavi letters. Italic *a*, *â*, *b*, *d*, *e*, *ê*, *h*, *i*,
*î*, *kh*, *l*, *p*, *r*, *s*h, *u*, *v*, *zd* indicate no change of
pronunciation; but *g* should be sounded like j, *hv* like wh, *k* like
ch in 'church,' *s* like sh, and Avesta *z* like French j.

4\. In the translation words in parentheses are merely explanatory of
those that precede them, and often translate Pahlavi glosses in the
original text.

5\. For the meaning of the abbreviations, used in the notes, see the
explanatory list after the Introduction.

6\. The manuscripts used for the Dînka*rd* are:—

B (written A.D. 1659), the only independent authority for Book VII; it
was brought from Irân to Surat in 1783, and one folio, at the end of
Chap. iv, appears to be missing.

K 43 (written A.D. 1594 and later), No. 43 in the University Library at
Kopenhagen, which contains another independent authority for Book V in
its later portion.

7\. The manuscripts used for the Selections of Zâ*d*-sparam are:—

K 35 (probably written A.D. 1572), No. 35 in the same library, which was
brought from Irân by Prof. Westergaard in 1843, along with No. 43.

T, a copy of a MS. about fifty years older, belonging to Ervad Tehmuras
Dinshawji Ankalesaria of Bombay.
