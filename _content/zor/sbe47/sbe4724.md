### CHAPTER XVI.

1\. About the trials (aûzmâyi*s*nŏ) which occurred

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

to him whose practice *was* lawful, and the signs of prophecy *that* are
seen therein, *it* is thus declared, namely; 'Another day, when *the
child had* been born, Pôrûshaspô called one of those five brothers of
the race of Karaps, and spoke thus: "Fully observe the marks *and*
specks of my son Zaratû*s*t."'

2\. *The Karap* went *and* sat down before Zaratû*s*t, and the head of
Zaratû*s*t *was* thereupon severely twisted by him, in order that he
should be killed; *but* he, being fearless, watched the wizards whose
terror *was* distressing <span id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_441). 3. As
*it was* in those ten nights for hospitality, Aûha*r*ma*zd* sent
Spenda*r*ma*d*, Arêdvisûr, and Ar*d*âî-fravar*d* <span
id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_442) down to the earth, by way of female
*care;* thereupon no variation occurred to *the child*, and, further,
the hand of that Karap *was* withered <span
id="fr_447"></span>[3](#fn_443), and that wizard demanded the life <span
id="fr_448"></span>[4](#fn_444) of Zaratû*s*t from Pôrûshaspô for the
harm from him, which sprang *upon* him*self* from his own action.

4\. *At* the same time Pôrûshaspô took Zaratû*s*t, and gave him to the
Karap, that he might do with him according to his own will. 5. He seized
him and threw him out, at the feet of the oxen who were going on a path
to the water; the leader of that drove of oxen stood still in *his*
vicinity, and 150 oxen, which walked behind it, *were* kept away from
him thereby; *and* Pôrûshaspô took *him*, and carried him back to the
house <span id="fr_449"></span>[5](#fn_445).

6\. Also the second day, *the Karap* threw *him* out

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

at the feet of the horses; and the leader of the horses stood still in
the vicinity of Zaratû*s*t, and 150 horses, which walked behind it,
*were* kept away from him thereby; *and* Pôrûshaspô took *him*, and
carried him back to the house <span id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_446).

7\. Also the third day, firewood is gathered together by *the Karap*,
and Zaratû*s*t is deposited on *it* by him, the fire is stirred up by
him, yet *with* the same result (ham-bûn-i*k*), the *child* is not burnt
by it, and those marks, which existed *and were* made upon him, *were* a
preservation from it <span id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_447).

8\. And the fourth day, he is thrown by *the Karap* into the lair
(âshyânakŏ) of a wolf; the wolf was not in the lair, *and* when it
wished to go back to the den (sûrâkŏ), it stopped when it came in front
of some radiance, *in* the manner of a mother, at the place *where its*
cub was. 9. In the night, Vohûmanô and Srôsh the righteous brought a
woolly (kûrû*s*akŏ) sheep *with* udder *full* of milk into the den, and
it gave milk to Zaratû*s*t, in digestible draughts (guvârakŏ guvârakŏ),
until day*light* <span id="fr_452"></span>[3](#fn_448).

10\. In the dawn, the mother of Zaratû*s*t went to that place, in the
expectation that it *would* be necessary to bring a skeleton out of the
den, and the woolly *sheep* came out *and* ran away; his mother supposed
that it was the wolf, and she spoke thus: 'Thou *hast* devoured to
repletion; mayst. thou endure for ever without it!' 11. She went
farther, *and* when she saw Zaratû*s*t quite safe, she then took him. up
and spoke thus: 'I *will* not give *thee* to any one during life, not
though both the provinces of Râgh and Nô*d*ar *should* arrive here
together <span id="fr_453"></span>[4](#fn_449).'

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

12\. Because these *princes were* among the spiritual from two provinces
which *are* in Âtûr-pâ*d*akân, such as *are* at sixty leagues (parasang)
from *K*îst: Zaratû*s*t arose from Râgh, and Vi*s*tâsp from Nô*d*ar. 13.
And of these two provinces, Râgh was according to the name of Êrikŏ,
*son* of Dûrêsrôbô, *son* of Mânû*sk*îhar <span
id="fr_454"></span>[1](sbe4725.htm#fn_450), from whom arose the race of
Zaratû*s*t: and Nô*d*ar *was* according to the name of Nô*d*ar, *son* of
Mânû*sk*îhar, from whom arose the race of Vi*s*tâsp.
