<P><A NAME="fn_333"></A><A HREF="sbe4716.htm#fr_337">119:1</A> He was the leader of the orthodox about A<I>D</I>. 815-835, and held a religious disputation with the heretic Ab&acirc;li<I>s</I> in the presence of the Khal&icirc;fah Al-M&acirc;m&ucirc;n (A. n. 813-833), as detailed in the M&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;g&acirc;n-&icirc; Gu<I>g</I>astak Ab&acirc;li<I>s</I>. He was also the first compiler of the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I>, probably of its first two Books, which are not yet discovered, as well as of some of the materials for the other Books. (See S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, p. 411, n. 1.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_334"></A><A HREF="sbe4716.htm#fr_338">119:2</A> The name of this MS. can be only guessed. It occurs three times in each of the two MS. authorities, B and K43, and the simplest reading of five of these six occurrences would be S&icirc;mr&acirc;, so that the remaining one (Sarm&acirc;) may be neglected as a corruption. A final &acirc; in Pahlavi is a very certain indication of a Semitic word, for if a final of similar form occurs in an Ir&acirc;nian word, it represents either h or kh; so if the name were Ir&acirc;nian, its most probable reading would be S&icirc;murkh. But, in &sect; 3, it is intimated that the MS. belonged to an ancient tribe, or congregation (ram); it also seems, from Chap. IV, 8, 9, that the religion of this tribe was not so inconsistent with Zoroastrianism, as to prevent its members being taught that orthodox faith; and &sect;&sect; 4, 5 of the present chapter appear to quote from that MS. some <A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A> particulars regarding the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. From these circumstances we may suspect that &Acirc;t&ucirc;<I>r</I>-farnbag, while collecting materials for his D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I>, had asked some Jewish friends what information their MSS. contained regarding the old Persians, as the two peoples had been in contact, more or less, ever since the time of the Achaemenian dynasty. If he did so enquire, the Jews would naturally search in the Talmud, in which references to the Persians still survive, though the text is no longer complete. The question is, therefore, whether the MS., whose name has been provisionally read S&icirc;mr&acirc;, can have had any connection with the Talmud. It will be at once evident to any Pahlavi student that Pahl. s&icirc; may be read gy&ecirc; equally well, and that we have no better reason for reading S&icirc;mr&acirc; than for the Gy&ecirc;mar&acirc;, which has been put into the text, as a suggestion that &Acirc;t&ucirc;<I>r</I>-farnbag was really referring to the Gemar&acirc; of the Jews, the supplement to their commentary upon Scripture. Whether this can be clearly proved remains to be seen, and positive evidence seems scanty.</P>
