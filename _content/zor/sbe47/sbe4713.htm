<p>1. About the marvellousness which is after the end of the millennium of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t and the arrival of A&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar, until the end of the millennium of A&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar and the arrival of A&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar-m&acirc;h; and as to tidings of the same period.</p>

<p>of A&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar's smiting <I>with</I> a serpent-scourge of several kinds <I>in</I> the religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers.</p>  
<p>3. The mightiness of the resources in the fifth century of the same millennium; the manifestation of the wizard Mahrk&ucirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> for seven years, in the year which is reported in all the regions which are seven; the coming on <I>and</I> arrival of the winter of Mahrk&ucirc;s, the perishing of most <I>of</I> mankind <I>and</I> animals within three winters and in the fourth, through the awfulness <I>of</I> those winters <I>and</I> the witchcraft of Mahrk&ucirc;s; and the dying away of Mahrk&ucirc;s of scanty progeny (ga<I>s</I>&ucirc;k&#335;-zahi<I>s</I>n&#335;), during the fourth winter, through the D&acirc;hm&acirc;n &Acirc;f<I>r</I>&icirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 4. The opening of the enclosure made by Yim, the coming of mankind <I>and</I> animals therefrom, <I>and</I> the complete progress of mankind and animals again, arising specially from them.</p>  
<p>5. After those winters, the abundant and great increase in the milk of cattle, and the abundant nourishment <I>of</I> mankind by milk; the less distress of body <I>in</I> cattle, the fullness and prosperity <I>of</I> the world, the celebrity of assembled mankind, <I>and</I> the great increase of liberality. 6. Also the feebleness</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A></p>  
<p><I>of</I> poverty among mankind, <I>just</I> like what revelation mentions thus: 'Even so he, <I>O</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! though he be more unfortunate than he who is accepting <I>from him</I>, is like the creator whose bounty of permanent liberality does thus, in the embodied existence, remain in his dwelling.'</p>  
<p>7. And this, too, it says, namely: &#8216;When that winter passes away, <I>of</I> which <I>it is</I> said that <I>it is</I> boisterous and destructive&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, then a wild beast, black and wide-travelling, walks up to the. Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers, and thus it thinks, that they <I>who</I> worship Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a <I>will</I> therefore not finally hate us more than him who is their own progeny, the son whom they thus bring up <I>as</I> a Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshipper here <I>below, in</I> fondness <I>and</I> freedom from malice towards well-yielding cattle.</p>  
<p>8. &#8216;Then Ashavahi<I>s</I>t&ocirc; calls out to the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers from the upper region, <I>and</I> thus he speaks: &#8220;You are for the worship of Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a; let no one <I>of you</I> become such a slaughterer of cattle as the slaughterers you have been before. 9. Recommend increase in gifts, recommend neighbourliness in person; are you worshipping Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a? do you slaughter cattle? do you slaughter those of them which give you assistance, which speak to you thus: 'On account of your helpfulness <I>one</I> tells you that you are worshipping Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a <I>and</I> you <I>may</I> eat?' I <I>am</I> in neighbourliness before that, until <I>the time</I> when you exclaim: 'Mine <I>are</I> the serpent and toad.'</p>  
<p>10. &#8216;&#8220;And you recommend increase, you recommend neighbourliness, <I>and</I> the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers slaughter cattle, even those of them who give them</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></p>  
<p>assistance, so that you are worshipping Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a <I>and</I> you eat; I <I>am</I> in neighbourliness before that, until <I>the time</I> when you exclaim: 'Mine <I>are</I> the serpent <I>and</I> toad.'</p>  
<p>11. '"Contentedly the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers slaughter cattle, contentedly the cattle of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers let <I>them</I> butcher&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and contented are the cattle when they do not butcher <I>them;</I> contentedly the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers eat cattle, <I>and</I> contented <I>are the cattle</I> when they eat them. 12. And then, when <I>there</I> are spirits, the slaughterers and whatever they slaughter, the butchers and whatever they butcher, <I>and</I> the eaters and whatever they eat <I>are</I> alike watched <I>by them</I>."'</p>  
<p>13. And this, too, it says, namely: 'When that century fully elapses, which is the fifth in the second millennium as regards the religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers, then of all those who <I>are</I> upon the earth, the existences which are both wicked and righteous, two-thirds <I>in</I> the land of Ir&acirc;n are righteous and one-<I>third</I> wicked; and so likewise the T&ucirc;r&acirc;nians <I>and</I> those who <I>are</I> around Ir&acirc;n remain non-Ir&acirc;nian around Ir&acirc;n; the chief increase in dwellings here <I>below</I>, of those in the embodied existence, remains <I>just</I> as now.'</p>  
<p>14. And this, too, it says, namely: 'When that millennium <I>has</I> fully elapsed, which is the first of the religion of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers, what is the separation after the first century?' 15. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'The sun conceals <I>itself</I>.' 16. 'And what is the separation after the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, <I>or</I> tenth</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A></p>  
<p>century?' 17. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: 'The sun conceals <I>itself</I>.'</p>  
<p>18. Then, when thirty winters of the tenth century <I>are</I> unelapsed (ar&acirc;nako), a maiden, who is Shap&icirc;r-ab&ucirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_309"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, walks up to the water; <I>she</I> that is the mother of that good A&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar-m&acirc;h&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_310"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and her former lineage is from V&ocirc;h&ucirc;-r&ocirc;<I>k</I>&ocirc;-&icirc; Frah&acirc;ny&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_311"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the family of &Icirc;sa<I>d</I>v&acirc;star, the son of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t <I>that</I> is brought forth by Aran<I>g</I>: 19. Then she sits in that water <I>and</I> drinks <I>it, and</I> she kindles in a high degree those germs which were the second <I>of</I> the last that the righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t <I>was</I> dropping forth originally, and they introduce that son whose name is the Developer <I>of</I> Worship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_312"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> (that is, he augments liberality). 20. Though fifteen years old, the damsel (zih&acirc;nak&#335;) <I>has</I> not before that associated with men; nor yet afterwards, when she becomes pregnant, <I>has she done so</I> before the time when she gives birth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_313"></A><A HREF="#fn_309"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>21. When that man becomes thirty years old, the sun stands still in the zenith of the sky <I>for</I> the duration of twenty days <I>and</I> nights&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="#fn_310"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> it shines over all the regions which are seven. 22. So, too, the declaration of them themselves is that they know</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that the separation of the millennium, which this religion <I>has</I> heard about by listening, is even thus; <I>and</I> of those who do not even then know, that it is something which is different.</p>  
<p>23. When that man becomes thirty years old, he confers with the archangels, the good rulers <I>and</I> good providers; <I>on</I> the morrow, in the daylight of the day, <I>it is</I> moreover manifest, when the embodied existence is <I>thus</I> undistressed&#8212;without a Kai and without a Karap (that is, not blind <I>and</I> not deaf to the affairs of the sacred beings), and is to be appropriated (that is, has not made its own self apart <I>from</I> the affairs of the sacred beings), and is produced full of life&#8212;that it has become extending, and is again great <I>in</I> various places in A&icirc;r&acirc;n-v&ecirc;<I>g</I> where the good D&acirc;&icirc;t&icirc; <I>is</I>.</p>
