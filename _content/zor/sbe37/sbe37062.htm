<p>1. The twelfth fargar<I>d</I>, U<I>s</I>tavaiti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, is about the exaltation of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t through the satisfaction of water, and the hope of all creatures for him. 2. And about the impure recitation of a text, when&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the text is not uttered by a high-priest. 3. This, too, that the text which a man who is corrupted may</p>

<p>offer is an impropriety (ad&icirc;n&acirc;&icirc;h) for that which is an uncorrupted place. 4. This, too, is declared, that a greedy man whose belly is filled by accumulation&#151;and the end of every sin is, to him, only for the gratification of the body&#151;<I>one</I> considers just like a gallows to which <I>there</I> is a foundation (<I>s</I>&icirc;p&#335;) of every impurity. 5. This, too, that a bird (v&acirc;&ecirc;) practises that habit (<I>s</I>&acirc;n) even that it kills those outright which have become large in <I>our</I> midst, which are the serpents produced by the demons. 6. This, too, that <I>for</I> invocation (azb&acirc;yi<I>s</I>n&#335;) of the sacred beings thinking with speaking, speaking with acting, and acting without deceitfulness are effectual.</p>  
<p>7. About the pure goodness of the archangels, and the union of their thoughts, words, <I>and</I> deeds together; their bountifulness, nurturing, and protection are the cause&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the prosperity of the world. 8. About the production of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t <I>by</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> with a goodness like his own. 9. This, too, that whoever gives anything to the disciples of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, his reward and recompense are just as though the thing had been given by him to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>
