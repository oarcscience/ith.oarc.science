<p>21. The name of the twentieth Nask is V&icirc;nd&acirc;d, <I>and</I> that is of twenty-two subdivisions [<i>&amp;c., very nearly the same as in II</i>, 20]. And <I>as to</I> this book V&icirc;nd&acirc;d, which is the twentieth book of the Nasks, out of the twenty-one Nasks of the Avesta, we and you are now using <I>it</I> in the ceremonial, and when,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_437"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 437</FONT></A></p>  
<p>after the calamity of Alexander, they sought for the books again, they found a portion of each Nask, <I>but</I> did not find any Nask in completeness except the V&icirc;nd&acirc;d which they found complete.</p>  
<p>22. The name of the twenty-first Nask is H&acirc;dokht, <I>and</I> that is of thirty subdivisions, about the manner of bringing together and the many miracles, and <I>their</I> excellences <I>and</I> connections; and in this book the accursed devil becomes cursed and becomes annihilated.</p>  
<p>23. At present, since the Nasks <I>have</I> not remained perfect in the midst <I>of us</I>, it is not possible to solemnize <I>them</I>, because Alexander the R&ucirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1725"></A><A HREF="#fn_1684"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> carried off a rough draft, in R&ucirc;man characters, of those of the twenty-one Nasks of the Avesta which were <I>about</I> the stars and medicine, and repeatedly burnt the books of the Avesta, so that the soul of Alexander burns in hell; and after his calamity, every one of the high-priests, in council together, preserved something of the Avesta in <I>his</I> mind, <I>and</I> the aggregate <I>has</I> disclosed the books of the Yasna (ya<I>s</I>t), V&icirc;sperad, Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d, Fravash, Kh&ucirc;rdah Avesta, Dar&ucirc;n, &Acirc;fr&icirc;ng&acirc;n, <I>K</I>&icirc;dah Va<I>g</I>arkardan, and Bundahi<I>s</I>, <I>which</I> they wrote correctly; <I>as to</I> the remainder (tatammah) which they did not write, it was on this account, that they did not preserve <I>it</I> correctly in <I>their</I> minds. And the expectation, descended from the midst <I>of them</I> in the court of Ormazd and the archangels, is thus, that Var<I>g</I>&acirc;vand, Pesh&ocirc;tan, and Hush&ecirc;dar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1726"></A><A HREF="#fn_1685"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>will</I> arrive in haste <I>for</I> the manifestation of the religion, and the goodness</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_438"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 438</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the religion again assumes splendour from a new head; the good and those of the good religion become cheerful and happy, and the bad and wicked become extinct and disappearing. Amen.</p>
