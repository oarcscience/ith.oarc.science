### CHAPTER XXXIV.

[*Var*s*tmânsar*](errata.htm#5) *Nask*.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . it is possible to come through virtuous
deeds *and* through virtuous thoughts.' *n*. And this, too, *he spoke*,
namely: 'That Good Thought <span id="fr_941"></span>[1](#fn_934) of mine
proceeds *and* notices the thoughts of the embodied existence, *and* of
the good words and the deeds he reports again those referring to me, as
often as three times in the same day, both *of those* who are liberal
*to* thee <span id="fr_942"></span>[1](#fn_934), *O* Spîtâmân! and *of
those* who are illiberal to thee.'

*o*. The struggling of the demons <span id="fr_943"></span>[2](#fn_935),
for the putting down of all benefit from mankind, *has* not produced the
obtainment of their capability for that benefit which arises *for*
mankind through the future existence; so that that one evil is more
grievous than every evil which the demons imagine for mankind, when *the
latter* are frightened by them from the way of the sacred beings, and
are wicked; and harder for them *are* the praisers of righteousness
among the apostates *and* the rest *of* the creation, through *their*
praise of righteousness, even when very many praise *it*.

*p*. About the progress of Ârmat <span id="fr_944"></span>[3](#fn_936)
and Târôkmat perpetually among the creatures, the disclosure of Ârmat
*to* mankind, and *of* righteousness *to* Târôkmat;

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

the listening of that vile Târôkmat to falsehood, and the distance <span
id="fr_945"></span>[1](#fn_937) *of* righteousness from him who is vile
is like *that of* a sheep fled (sî*s*d) <span
id="fr_946"></span>[2](#fn_938) from mankind. *q*. And this, too, that
the evil spirit is beaten <span id="fr_947"></span>[3](#fn_939) by
complete mindfulness, in the struggle of those having mighty ones, just
as a powerful man beats him who is a reverent creation (nîyâyîn
dahi*s*nŏ) <span id="fr_948"></span>[4](#fn_940); *and* the pure
Zaratû*s*t is produced *by* Aûha*r*ma*zd*, *as well as* the power of
Khû*r*da*d* *and* Amû*r*da*d* <span id="fr_949"></span>[5](#fn_941)
which *acts* forcibly for giving value (far*g*) and preparing the
creatures.

*r*. About the opposition of Aûha*r*ma*zd* to the demons <span
id="fr_950"></span>[6](#fn_942), and the valuation of the deeds of
mankind *which* exist for greater jurisdiction <span
id="fr_951"></span>[7](#fn_943) *and* more advantage of the primitive
good creation; and in any doubtfulness *one is* to perform the
ceremonial of the sacred beings. *s*. About *cases* where the good-will
*of* the spirit of complete mindfulness makes mankind attain to the good
religion; and their spiritual joy <span id="fr_952"></span>[8](#fn_944)
arises from the purification of their own religion through virtuous
exercise of will.

*t*. About the desire *for* a reward *for* anything whatever, and the
great advantage owing to a reward of the desires *of* mankind; *also*
the appropriation of the reward through the operation of the sacred
beings:—'Even through the ruler (pa*d*) of that dominion of yours do I
produce the renovation *of* the existences by *my* will <span
id="fr_953"></span>[9](#fn_945), I who am Aûha*r*ma*zd*.'

*u*. Excellence is righteousness *that is* perfect.
