### XIX. VENDÎDÂD NASK <span id="fr_1832"></span>[3](#fn_1782).

The whole of this Nask (as described in Dk. VIII, Chap. XLIV) is still
extant, and is considered by the writers of the Persian Rivâyats to be a
complete work. Its fragmentary character, which is obvious enough to
European scholars, must, therefore, be

attributed, in all probability, to losses it sustained before the
revival of Ma*zd*a-worship by the Sasanian dynasty. It is remarkable
that the compiler of the account in the Dinka*rd* makes no allusion to
the twelfth fargar*d* of the Vendîdâ*d*, which is also omitted in all
old MSS. of the Vendîdâ*d* with Pahlavi that have been examined,
although the copyists appear to have been aware of the existence of a
twelfth fargar*d*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1782"></span>[481:3](sbe37147.htm#fr_1832) The extent of
this Nask appears to be the same now as it was in Sasanian times, and
may be estimated at about 23,000 Avesta and 48,000 Pahlavi words. The
moderately long account of it in Dk. VIII, contains 1,272 Pahlavi words.
