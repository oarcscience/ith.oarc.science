### CHAPTER XLV.

1\. Of the three divisions of the Hâ*d*ôkht <span
id="fr_471"></span>[3](#fn_468), as it exists in its 133 sections, the
first is *of* thirteen <span id="fr_472"></span>[4](#fn_469) sections,
*and contains* particulars about the nature of the recital of the
Ahunavair <span id="fr_473"></span>[5](#fn_470), which is the spiritual
benefit from chanting it aloud, and whatever is on the same
subject <span id="fr_474"></span>[6](#fn_471). 2. Advice about selecting
*and*

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

keeping a spiritual and worldly high-priest, performing every duty as to
the high-priest, and maintaining even those of various high-priests.

3\. About the twenty-one chieftainships, spiritually through
Aûha*r*ma*zd* and materially through Zaratû*s*t, through which the
ceremonial of the sacred beings *and* the government of the members of
the community (dâhmânŏ râyînî*d*ârîh) exist. 4. About the duties in the
five periods <span id="fr_475"></span>[1](#fn_472) of the day and night,
each separately, and the bridge*-judgment* of him who shouts out <span
id="fr_476"></span>[2](#fn_473) in the ceremony of a
season-festival <span id="fr_477"></span>[3](#fn_474); *likewise of* him
who does not provide the preparations for the feast of a
season-festival, and who also becomes worried (sû*d*akŏ) in other
ceremonials of the sacred beings.

5\. About how to consider *and* what to do with a sacerdotal leader
*and* a man *of* the superior classes (pî*s*akîkânŏ), him who atones for
unimportant sin, and him who does not atone even for *that which is*
important; *and* whatever is on the same subject. 6. About the means
through which membership of the community (dâhmîh) is prepared. 7. About
the manifestation of virtuous manhood, and the merit and advantage from
well uttering the words *of blessing* at eating *and* drinking food
*and* drink, and *from* despising the inward talk of the demons.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 8. About the
recitations at the five periods *of the day*, the ceremonial invocation
by name of many angels in each separately, *and* great information on
the same subject.

9\. The worthiness *of* a man restrained (vandak) by authority, the
devotion of life and body to the sacred beings, the good rulers, and
their examination and satisfaction; *also* the blessing and winning
words which are most successful in carrying off the affliction that is
owing to the fiend. 10. About all-pleasing creativeness and omniscience,
every precedence <span id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_475), leadership,
foresight <span id="fr_479"></span>[2](#fn_476), worthy liberality,
perspicacity (vênâkîh), and all proper cause *and* effect of
righteousness; the individuality (khû*d*îh) of righteousness, the
opposition to the demons of Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s law, and also much other
information in the same section.

11\. The middle *division* is *of* 102 sections *containing* particulars
about spiritual and worldly diligence, the leadership *of* the diligent
and their mighty means, all the former deeds of righteousness. 12.
Righteousness kindling the resolution is the reward of merit, each for
each, and is provided by it for that which *one* mentions thus:—'*It is*
the Hâ*d*ôkht which is the maintenance of righteousness, so that it may
make righteousness more abiding in the body of a man.'

13\. The last *division* is *of* nineteen sections *containing* a trusty
remedy, that is, a remedy whose utterance aloud by the faithful is a
chief resource (*a*fzârtûm) for the creatures of the sacred beings.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 14. Also the
nature of sayings full of humility (pûrpâstîh), well-favoured, most
select, *and* adapted *for* that which *one* mentions thus:—'I reverence
that chief, the beneficent *and* eminent Hâ*d*ôkht, out of which is the
sustainment of the strength of every word of Zaratû*s*t they trust in.'

15\. It is perfect excellence *that* is righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_468"></span>[166:3](sbe37048.htm#fr_471) Corresponding to
the twentieth word, dada*d*, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.;
but it is the twenty-first, and last, Nask in other Rivâyats. Its name
occurs in the Avesta, in the form hadhaokhta, and it is called Hâdukht
in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained thirty kardah, or
fargar*d*s, which differs considerably from the number stated in this
chapter. Yts. XXI, XXII are traditionally supposed to belong to the
Hâ*d*ôkht, but there is hardly a trace of either of them in this
chapter. Yt. XI is also distinguished by the same title.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[166:4](sbe37048.htm#fr_472) As the total of
the 13 + 102 + 19 sections (mentioned in §§ 1, 11, 13) is 134, instead
of 133, there must be an error in one of the four numbers given in the
MS. This clerical error can hardly have been made in writing 19, and is
unlikely in 102; but 133 may possibly stand for an original 134, though
the writing of 13 instead of 12 is more probable. The Rivâyats give no
assistance in settling this question, as they all divide this Nask into
30 kardah. On the whole, it will be safest to read 'twelve,' instead of
'thirteen,' until some better authority becomes available.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[166:5](sbe37048.htm#fr_473) Compare Yt. XI, 3.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[166:6](sbe37048.htm#fr_474) It is just
possible that this may refer to Yt. XXI which, though specially alluding
to the recitation of the Ashem-vohû, or praise of <span id="page_167">p.
167</span> righteousness, also mentions that of the Ahunavair in its §
4. With regard, however, to Yt. XXII, there seems no possibility of
identifying its text with any portion of the Hâ*d*ôkht Nask as described
in this chapter.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[167:1](sbe37048.htm#fr_475) See Chap. XXIX, 9.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[167:2](sbe37048.htm#fr_476) Reading ba*r*â
drâyê*d*ŏ, but it may be ba*r*â girâyê*d*ŏ, 'is zealous.'

<span id="fn_474"></span>[167:3](sbe37048.htm#fr_477) See Chap. VII, 1.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[168:1](sbe37048.htm#fr_478) Assuming that
pe*s*âgîh stands for pê*s*agîh.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[168:2](sbe37048.htm#fr_479) Assuming that
pe*s* vônâkîh stands for pê*s* vênâkîh.
