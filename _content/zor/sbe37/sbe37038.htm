<p align="center"><I>H&ucirc;sp&acirc;ram Nask</I>.</p>  
<p>1. One section <I>contains</I> particulars about the science (d&acirc;ni<I>s</I>n&#335;) of seeking a son, advice about it from revelation (d&ecirc;n&ocirc;), the advantage of offspring for the admonitory explanation of revelation within <I>one's</I> self, <I>and</I> the harm owing to neglecting the advice of the same.</p>  
<p>2. About what <I>happens</I> in the begetting of a son; the first sexual excitement it should produce for the female, the second, third, fourth, <I>and</I> fifth; the arising of a son in the world, <I>and</I> also the milk, owing to <I>her</I> impregnation. 3. And, when <I>it is</I> so that it amounts to a son, which of the <I>two</I>, male <I>or</I> female, is sooner emitting the germs at the time <I>of</I> occurrence; <I>and</I> how <I>and</I> how long both <I>have</I> remained, at the time, in semination, how long in connection, and how long in bleeding. 4. When <I>and</I> wherefrom various expectations are produced to contend <I>about</I>, and when and by what signs the male sex, or female sex, of the offspring <I>has</I> become manifest.</p>  
<p>5. When the localization&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> regarding <I>it</I> is arranged; and, <I>as to</I> the members, which is the first member therein, and <I>their</I> being produced, each consecutively, till the bodily form is complete; which, <I>and</I> in what position, is the localization of the members after the complete production of the form of the body, <I>and</I> the purpose as regards the position <I>and</I> localization of the members after the complete production <I>of</I> the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></p>  
<p>form of the body. 6. The effect upon the offspring which is <I>furnished</I> with subjection to the male, so far as the complete effecting of it is within the limit for its authorisation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; the time (vidan&acirc;&acirc;nag&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>) of the offspring with the female, the period of its turning downwards for birth, <I>and</I> the occurrence of birth <I>at</I> the same time.</p>  
<p>7. About the growth of life, too, with the bodily organs (tan&ucirc;g&acirc;n); <I>and</I> which is the first bone become possessed of marrow, <I>apart</I> from the other bones, as it is reported. 8. About the admissibility of the elaboration <I>of</I> the male sex, <I>or</I> female sex, within it, <I>by</I> the guardian spirit of the righteous, at the fifth month; and the ceremony for the guardian spirit of the righteous for the sake of the arrival of a male child.</p>  
<p>9. About the act of childbirth by a pregnant woman before <I>recourse to</I> midwifery (d&acirc;ig&acirc;n&icirc;h), except that relating to the navel string of the child; also its first and second food, and when the midwifery is <I>that</I> of her mother; what is the kind of milk, <I>and</I> the care of the child at the time, <I>its</I> bandaging, sleeping, nourishment, and protection; <I>and</I> the sin owing to acting unlawfully in such matters. 10. About how many months is the bearing of the offspring in the womb <I>of</I> the camel, horse, ass,</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A></p>  
<p>cow, and woman; and whatever is on the same subject. 11. About the spiritual perception <I>of</I> a newborn child, <I>and its</I> coming into the boundaries of worldly comprehension on the same subjects.</p>  
<p>12. About the habits through which multitudes <I>of</I> mankind <I>attain</I> to the acme of beautiful form: that of desire for women, that of swiftness which is owing to the strength of the leg, and that of powerfulness which is owing to the vigour of the body, that of desire for wealth, that of speaking in an assembly, and that of speaking at a distance, that through which <I>any one</I> uncontrolled comes to a downfall, that through which <I>there is</I> more knowledge of obedience, <I>and</I> that through which a counteraction of the affliction of the race arises.</p>  
<p>13. About the vicious desire of the performer <I>and</I> permitter of unnatural intercourse; also their violent lustfulness, heinous practice, and corrupt, polluted bodies, blighted in destiny; great through their destruction of life in the things which they see, and every greatness inevitably provides <I>them</I> a merited death; <I>as</I> great in sinfulness as <I>A</I><I>z</I>-&icirc; Dah&acirc;k&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in oppression, <I>as</I> the serpent Sr&ocirc;bar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in witchcraft, <I>as</I> T&ucirc;r-&icirc; Br&acirc;<I>d</I>r&ocirc;-r&ecirc;sh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the Karap&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, in destroying the</p>

<p>righteous, <I>and as</I> a deceiving apostate in falsehood. 14. About the grievous sinfulness of a woman, just delivered and giving milk, whose progeny is the offspring from intercourse with divers males, and whatever is on the same subject.</p>  
<p>15. About the increasing vigour <I>of</I> the female from the mounting of the male, and the diminished vigour of the male from mounting <I>on</I> to the female.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_279"></A><A HREF="sbe37038.htm#fr_280">109:1</A> Assuming that g&ecirc;s&icirc;-hastan&#335; stands for g&acirc;s&icirc;-hastan&#335; in all three occurrences of the word. This is rather doubtful, because the noun g&acirc;s, 'position,' occurs twice in close connection with the uncertain word, and is correctly spelt.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_280"></A><A HREF="sbe37038.htm#fr_281">110:1</A> The Pahl. text is as follows:&#151;'K&acirc;r-&icirc; madam z&acirc;k&#335;-&icirc; levatman d&ecirc;n ku<I>s</I>n s<I>p</I>ar, vad <I>s</I><I>p</I>&ocirc;r k&acirc;r&icirc;h zya<I>s</I> d&ecirc;n s&acirc;m&acirc;n pa<I>d</I>a<I>s</I> ra<I>d</I>ak&icirc;h.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_281"></A><A HREF="sbe37038.htm#fr_282">110:2</A> This unusual hybrid word is evidently intended as a Zv&acirc;ri<I>s</I> equivalent of the Ir&acirc;nian zam&acirc;nah, and is composed of vidan&acirc; (= Ch. &#8207;&#1506;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1488;&#8206;, which is the usual Zv&acirc;ri<I>s</I> for zam&acirc;n) + &acirc;nag (= &acirc;nah, the final syllables of zam&acirc;nah). The central syllable of zam&acirc;nah is, therefore, twice represented in the Zv&acirc;ri<I>s</I> vidan&acirc;&acirc;nag. The hybrid occurs again, in Bk. IX, Chap. XVII, 3, in a phrase where it can only mean 'time, period.' If it were not for this after-occurrence, the word here might be read va-d&ocirc;-ah&ucirc;g, 'and the dual existence,' with some degree of probability.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_282"></A><A HREF="sbe37038.htm#fr_283">111:1</A> See Chap. XIII, 8 n, and compare the account of the seven special evil-doers in Dd. LXXII, 3-9.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_283"></A><A HREF="sbe37038.htm#fr_284">111:2</A> The Av. a<I>z</I>i srvara of Yas. IX, 11 (W.), Yt. XIX, 40; a terrible serpent slain by Keres&acirc;spa the S&acirc;man, as mentioned again in Bk. IX, Chap. XV, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_284"></A><A HREF="sbe37038.htm#fr_285">111:3</A> Also written Br&acirc;<I>d</I>r&ocirc;k-r&ecirc;sh; he was one of the T&ucirc;r&acirc;nian priesthood who persecuted Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t in his youth, and probably the same as Pers. Bartar&ucirc;sh (the Br&acirc;<I>d</I>ar-vakhsh of Sd. IX, 5) who is said to have killed Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t in the end. But, as he was one of five brothers, three of whose names were much alike (see Byt. II, 3 n), his identification is rather uncertain.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_285"></A><A HREF="sbe37038.htm#fr_286">111:4</A> Av. karapan. In Dk. Bk. VII the Karaps are often mentioned <A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A> as enemies of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, both before and after his birth. Some are named, such as D&ucirc;r&acirc;sr&ocirc;b, Br&acirc;<I>d</I>r&ocirc;k-r&ecirc;sh, Va&ecirc;dv&ocirc;i<I>s</I>t, and <I>G</I>&ecirc;shmak. The Karap of the district where the mother of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t was born banishes her for witchcraft, and must, therefore, have been the official head of the district. D&ucirc;r&acirc;sr&ocirc;b, the Karap, travels sometimes with a disciple (h&acirc;vi<I>s</I>t), so his title was probably a priestly one. The Karap is also often mentioned with the Ka&icirc;, or K&icirc;k (Av. kavan or kavi), the title of an equally obnoxious class; both K&icirc;ks and Karaps being termed 'demon-worshippers,' or idolators; and the Pahlavi translators of the Avesta speak of them, metaphorically, as 'blind and deaf' to the sacred beings.</P>
