### CHAPTER XVIII.

*Nîkâ*d*ûm Nask*.

1\. The third section is the Rêshistân ('*wound code*'), particulars
about cutting, tearing, cleaving,

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

disembowelling, stabbing, gnawing <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_147),
rupturing, hacking, mutilating, and withering <span
id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_148); such as are all called wounds. 2. The
upheaving circular movement of a certain serpent-scourge <span
id="fr_150"></span>[3](#fn_149), the throwing down of the person, and
the flow of blood from the bodies of the people.

3\. How the various members are divided into seventy-six that are more
particularly called principal, which are comprised in two classes; two
of these, which are clothed *and* different, one from the other, are
female, and *some* out of the surrounding parts (girvôgânîh), which are
*apart* from eight of the principal, that are comprised in the members
of the two classes *and* among those seventy-six—*and* which, in like
manner, are different one from the other—are female, and are *of*
different purpose and different design, one from the other.

4\. These, too, namely, when any one, through an assault, produces, for
any other, stupefaction, swelling, or leanness, blackness <span
id="fr_151"></span>[4](#fn_150), or paleness, shortness, or tallness,
want of intelligence, much eating, little eating, or moderate eating,
indolence, or diligence, or dulness of hearing; or he wishes to speak
*some* words, and they strike him in return; or *one* altogether
diminishes *any* one's speech, sight, *or* hearing,

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

wisdom, strength, *or* semen, milk, *or* pregnancy; *or* when *one*
destroys the spleen (s*p*ur) or milk of females, or, in revenge
(gî*f*ar), kills *his* son outright; *or* when they would inflict a
wound upon a wound, and one's blood goes streaming forth.

5\. Also about an assault with one, two, or three weapons, or more, in
conjunction; or they may commit *it* on the spot, or in confederacy, or
as a first offence <span id="fr_152"></span>[1](sbe37022.htm#fn_151). 6.
About the measure of a wound when a two-edged sword (dôbarakŏ) plunges
down, the area (sarâî), walls, and surroundings, and the shape which is
plunged; that *which* is hacked, or cleft, or mutilated, or a torrent
*of* blood streaming; the affliction (vamang) of the furious
serpent-scourge (mârvanô) <span
id="fr_153"></span>[2](sbe37022.htm#fn_152), and the length, glitter,
and weight of the weapon.

7\. The ritual for the departure of a wound and the departure of pain,
watching over *it for* the duration of three nights *or* a year, *its*
greater wretchedness *or* less wretchedness, *its* cure (s*p*ôrîkîh) or
incurableness, and whatever is on the same subject. 8. Trivial
enumerations, and decisions upon each separately.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_147"></span>[42:1](sbe37021.htm#fr_148) Or, perhaps,
khvâyi*s*nŏ (compare Pers. ‘*h*âyîdan) may mean 'biting.'

<span id="fn_148"></span>[42:2](sbe37021.htm#fr_149) The last four terms
are, in Pahlavi: *s*kôni*s*nŏ, khûr*d*ŏ ka*rd*anŏ, tâshî*d*anô, and
khû*s*înî*d*anô.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[42:3](sbe37021.htm#fr_150) The mâr-ganô (Av.
khrafstraghna), we are told in Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 6, 'may be *made* of
anything, *but* a leathern *one* is good' (see also Bd. XXVIII, 22).
Intended as a snake-killer, it was misused as a scourge for human
beings.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[42:4](sbe37021.htm#fr_151) Assuming that
vê*s*îh, 'excess,' is a miswriting of siyahîh.
