### XIII. SPEND NASK <span id="fr_1803"></span>[1](#fn_1754).

Dk. VIII, Chap. XIV, 1, probably refers to the passage that contained
the statement thus quoted in Sls. X, 4, XII, 11:—'*It is* revealed in
the Spend that *towards* Dûkdâv, the mother of Zaratû*s*t, when she was
pregnant with Zaratû*s*t, every night *for* three nights a leader with a
hundred and fifty demons rushed (*or* came) for the destruction of
Zaratû*s*t, yet, owing to the existence of the fire in the dwelling,
they knew no means of accomplishing *it*.'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XIV, 8, probably refers to the passage that contained
the statement alluded to in AV. XXXII and thus quoted in Sls. XII,
29:—'As in the Spend *it was* shown to Zaratû*s*t about one man, that
all *his* limbs were in torment, *but* one foot was outside; *and*
Zaratû*s*t enquired of Aûha*r*ma*zd* about the cause *of it;* and
Aûha*r*ma*zd* said that he was a man, Davâns <span
id="fr_1804"></span>[2](#fn_1755) *by* name; he was a ruler over
thirty-three districts, and no good work *was* ever practised by him,
except one time when fodder *was* conveyed by him to a sheep with that
one foot.'

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span>

No allusion to the following two passages, quoted from the Spend, has
been noticed in Dk. VIII, Chap. XIV:—

In Sls. XII, 3, it is said that 'in the Spend *it* is revealed that a
fire, when they shall make it quite clean from its chilled charcoal,
*has* as much comfort as a man whose clothing they shall make clean.'

In Sls. XII, 15, it is said that 'in the Spend and Nihâ*d*ûm the
high-priests *have* taught that the duty and good works which a son
performs become as much the father's as though they had been done by his
own hand.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1754"></span>[469:1](sbe37141.htm#fr_1803) The short
account of this Nask, in Dk. VIII, contains 347 Pahlavi words, which
would represent about 20,500 words of Pahlavi version, according to the
proportion guessed in the case of Nask XII. But, this being a Gâthic
Nask, the proportion of Avesta to Pahlavi ought to be that calculated
for the Gâthic Nasks I, II, III, XXI, which would give about 9,900 words
of Avesta text for this Nask. The seventh book of the Dinka*rd*, whose
contents are very similar to those attributed to the Spend Nask,
contains about 16,000 Pahlavi words.
