### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. The Ra*d*ŏ-dâ*d*-aîtag <span id="fr_70"></span>[4](#fn_69)
*contains* particulars *about* the religious and important customs *and*
laws to be

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

enforced. 2. The reason of the worthiness and superexcellence in a
sacerdotal leader, *and his* possession of a portion of the other
authority (patîh) *of* a ruler also; that is, how worthiness is to be
distinguished from unworthiness, and superexcellence from unworthiness,
in him, namely, in the priestly chieftainship (ra*d*îh) *of*
Khvanîras <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70) *and* the other Legions,
each separately, the first which stood aloof from the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers.

3\. About the demonstration *and* notification of the sitting together
of the archangels, the ritual and appliances in the ceremonial of the
sacred beings, the position and business of the Zôtis *and* Râspîs <span
id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_71) in a ceremonial, and also all the business
*of* the leaders in their duty, each separately *and* originally <span
id="fr_73"></span>[3](#fn_72). 4. The greatness of the helpfulness
(vi*g*î*d*âr-dahi*s*nîh) in good works, the kinds of helpfulness, and
the proximity *of* Aûha*r*ma*zd* to the thoughts, words, *and* deeds
*of* the embodied existence.

5\. The excellence *of* righteousness is perfect.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_69"></span>[19:4](sbe37011.htm#fr_70) Corresponding to the
seventh word, *k*î*d*, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it
is the eighth Nask in other Rivâyats. Ra*d*ŏ-dâ*d*-aîtag means
'concerning the habits of a priestly master,' which is a fair
description of the contents of this Nask, but it is misread Ratu*s*tâî,
or Ratu*s*tâîd, in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained
originally fifty kardah, or subdivisions, of which only thirteen were
recovered after the time of Alexander.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[20:1](sbe37011.htm#fr_71) Av. *Hv*aniratha, the
central region of the earth, containing the countries best known to the
Irânians, around which the other six smaller regions were supposed to be
arranged.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[20:2](sbe37011.htm#fr_72) See Chap. VII, 5.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[20:3](sbe37011.htm#fr_73) Or 'fundamentally'
(va*l* bûn).
