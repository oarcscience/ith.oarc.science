<p>Dk. IX, Chaps. X LVII-XLIX, describe the contents of the first three fargar<I>d</I>s of this Nask, which are still extant in the Avesta text of Yas. XIX&#151;XXI, whose Pahlavi version may be translated as follows:&#151;</p>  <h4 align="center">Pahl. Yas. XIX = Bak&#335; I.</h4>

<p>1. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t enquired of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> thus: 'O A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1736"></A><A HREF="#fn_1695"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> propitious spirit, creator of the world of embodied existences, <I>and</I> righteous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1737"></A><A HREF="#fn_1696"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>!

<p>4. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke thus: &#145;They were the apportionment of the Ahunavair, <I>O</I> Sp&icirc;t&acirc;m&acirc;n Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! (that spirit who would make the religion current, who has formed that religion from the Ahunavair) which was spoken out by me for thee; (5) (that is,) before the sky, (<i>&amp;c., as in</i> &sect; 3).</p>  
<p>6. &#145;Whoever chants that apportionment of the Ahunavair, <I>O</I> Sp&icirc;t&acirc;m&acirc;n Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! without talking (that is, he does not speak out in the middle of any of its difficult Avesta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1739"></A><A HREF="#fn_1698"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>) <I>and</I> not without anxiety (that he <I>may</I> slumber), (7) <I>it is</I> like a hundred above any other authority of those of the G&acirc;thas, when <I>one</I> chants <I>them</I> without talking, <I>or</I> not without anxiety&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1740"></A><A HREF="#fn_1699"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; (thus it becomes <I>fit</I> for the ceremonial). 8. Whoever chants <I>it</I> while talking, <I>or</I> without anxiety, (thus it becomes <I>fit</I> for the ceremonial,) <I>it is</I> like ten above any other authority of those of the G&acirc;thas.</p>  
<p>9. &#145;Whoever in that embodied existence of mine, <I>O</I> Sp&icirc;t&acirc;m&acirc;n Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! recalls the apportionment of</p>

<p>the Ahunavair, (that is, seeks for <I>it</I>,) and, further, mutters that which he recalls, (that is, shall accomplish <I>it</I> easily,) and, further, chants that which he mutters, (that is, fully understands its ritual,) and, further, reverences that which is chanted, (that is, shall celebrate the ceremony,) (10) his soul I pass on to the best existence, three times over the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> bridge, I who am A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, (that is, on that day <I>in</I> which he shall faithfully &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1741"></A><A HREF="#fn_1700"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> provide the ceremony, it shall&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1742"></A><A HREF="#fn_1701"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> lead his soul three times unto <I>the world</I> yonder, and shall&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1743"></A><A HREF="#fn_1701"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> cause its happiness therein) (11) to the best existence, the best righteousness, and the best light. 12. Also whoever in that embodied existence of mine, <I>O</I> Sp&icirc;t&acirc;m&acirc;n Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! mutters the apportionment of the Ahunavair, (that is, shall accomplish <I>it</I> easily,) <I>and</I> drops&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1744"></A><A HREF="#fn_1702"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, (that is, cuts off&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1745"></A><A HREF="#fn_1703"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>) (13) either&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1746"></A><A HREF="#fn_1704"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> as much as a half, or as much as a third, or as much as a fourth, or as much as a fifth, (at a fifth the foundation <I>of the sin</I> is laid, at a half it becomes quite complete, and when he shall cut off the whole <I>it is</I> a Tan&acirc;p&ucirc;har&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1747"></A><A HREF="#fn_1705"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> <I>sin</I>,) (14) I twirl&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1748"></A><A HREF="#fn_1706"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> away the soul of him, I who am A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, from the best existence, (that is, I. would put it out;) (15) to such an extent and width is the twirling away as <I>that of</I> this earth, <I>and</I> even so the extent of this earth is as much as its width.&#146;</p>

<p>an Ahu <I>and</I> possessing a Ratu, (from which this is manifest, namely, the possession of a ruler and high-priest. 17. This, too, is said, that it was) before that sky <I>was</I> created, before the water, before the earth, before the plants, (18) before the creation of the four-legged ox (which <I>was</I> the sole-created ox), (19) before the creation of the two-legged righteous man (who <I>was</I> G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>), (20) <I>and</I> before that sun of definite form (the body of the sun) <I>was</I> created as an acquirement of the archangels. 21. It <I>was</I> (likewise) proclaimed to me by the spirituality of propitiousness, (it likewise became possible for the spirituality of propitiousness to say (22) <I>what was</I> said&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1749"></A><A HREF="#fn_1707"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t,) concerning the whole material existence of the righteous who are, who have been, and who <I>will</I> arise, (23) as to the progress of work, (that is, while they shall perform for it that which is specified by it, and good works shall arise through them,) <I>that</I> this work, among the living, is for A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, (that is, that which they may perform, suitable for A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, they shall so perform as is declared by this fargar<I>d</I>).</p>  
<p>24. This, too, is the most expressive (most in effect) of those statements which <I>were</I> ever spoken forth (till now), <I>or which one</I> speaks forth (at present)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1750"></A><A HREF="#fn_1708"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>or shall</I> speak forth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1751"></A><A HREF="#fn_1709"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (even henceforth); (25) for it is <I>through</I> such a statement (such in effect) as that, <I>if</I> the whole embodied existence (26) learnt it <I>and</I>, having learnt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1752"></A><A HREF="#fn_1710"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, (that is, they shall accomplish <I>it</I> easily,) they retain <I>it</I>, (that is, they</p>

<p>should rely upon it,) abstinence from passing <I>away</I> would be quite masterful, (that is, they become immortal). 27. This, too, is our saying spoken forth, (preserved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1753"></A><A HREF="#fn_1711"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> among the revelation mentioned <I>n</I> this&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1754"></A><A HREF="#fn_1712"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> fargar<I>d</I>,) which is learnt, (that is, they shall accomplish it easily,) and <I>one</I> recites, (that is, he utters it in a ceremonial,) thus <I>for</I> any one whatever of the beings whose righteousness is best, (that is, should he do it for a ceremonial, he becomes <I>fit</I> for it; it is when he utters this in a ceremonial <I>that</I> his soul becomes immortal).</p>  
<p>28. As <I>it is</I> here spoken forth, (that a ruler and high-priest are to be maintained; as these things are so spoken, <I>and</I> as this law is so) (29) even when it gives him an Ahu and a Ratu, (that is, it gives up <I>his</I> person to the priestly assembly,) so it is thereby taught to him <I>that</I> the thought of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is the creature <I>with</I> the first thinking, (that is, the G&acirc;thic lore is set going by him ) (30) whatever teaches&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1755"></A><A HREF="#fn_1713"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> this (is the person of him who is king of kings, who) is the greatest (of men) of every description&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1756"></A><A HREF="#fn_1714"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, (that is, it possesses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1757"></A><A HREF="#fn_1713"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> a person in the king of kings ) <I>and</I> so it is taught <I>that</I> the creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1758"></A><A HREF="#fn_1715"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> are for him, (where the G&acirc;thic lore is set going by him).</p>

<p>38. For the sake of development A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, (for cherishing the creatures,) pronounced the Ahunavair, and in its development <I>there</I> was a summing up, (that is, its end occurred). 39. Quickly, when&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1768"></A><A HREF="#fn_1721"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> destruction arose, (that is&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1769"></A><A HREF="#fn_1722"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the destroyer,) <I>and</I> rushed in, even among the wicked he uttered (as resistance) (40) this interdict:&#151;(41) 'Neither our thoughts, nor&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1770"></A><A HREF="#fn_1722"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> teachings, (<I>as</I> I have not taught that which thou hast taught,) nor wisdoms, (for I consider wisdom as virtuousness, and thou considerest <I>it</I> as viciousness,) (42) nor wills, (for my will is a virtuous wish, and thine a vicious <I>one</I>,) nor words, (for I speak that which is virtuous, and thou speakest that which is vicious) nor actions, (for my actions are virtuous, and thine are vicious,) (43) nor religions, (for my religion is the G&acirc;thic lore, and thine is witchcraft,) nor souls are themselves in unison, (for <I>as to</I> those who rely upon my things, and those who rely upon thy things, their souls are not in one place;' he who said this, that even their souls exist, must thus say that <I>they are</I> not souls in unison <I>with</I> ours).</p>  
<p>44. Also this saying, which A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> uttered, <I>has</I> the three degrees, the four classes, (priest, warrior, husbandman, and artisan) the five chieftainships, (house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler, province-ruler,</p>

<p>and supreme Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t,) and its summing up is with liberality, (thus it is possible to make <I>it</I> completely for their own, when they deliver themselves up to the priests). 45. Which are the degrees of it? Good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; (they are&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1771"></A><A HREF="#fn_1723"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, indeed, virtuous among the degrees of religion). 46. Which are the classes? The priest, warrior, husbandman, and artisan, (47) who are the whole day <I>and</I> night with a righteous man, who are thinking rightly, speaking rightly, and acting rightly, (48) who <I>have</I> recognised a priestly authority, (that is, possess a high-priest,) who <I>have</I> taught the religion, (that is, have provided a ceremony,) (49) <I>and</I> who, through their actions, are a furtherance of the world of righteousness, (owing to the work they accomplish). 50. Which are the chiefs? The house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler, province-ruler, and the Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t is the fifth (51) <I>in</I> those provinces which are other than the Ragha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1772"></A><A HREF="#fn_1724"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t; <I>with</I> four chieftainships is the Ragha of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t. 52. Which are the chiefs of that? The house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler, and the Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t is the fourth; (that is, when he was in his own province, he also produced its period <I>of prosperity</I>, who arises fourth).</p>  
<p>53. How <I>was it</I> when through good thought, (that is, the religion remained in the degree of good thought)? When it arose first in a righteous thinker, (it arose in G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>, and he thought for it). 54. How, when through good words? When <I>it was</I> the bounteous text, (doing good). 55. How,</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_461"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 461</FONT></A></p>  
<p>when through good deeds? When <I>it was</I> the praise even of righteousness <I>by</I> the first creature, (that is, they shall perform the ceremonial, and also other good works, through the G&acirc;tha lore).</p>  
<p>56. A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> proclaimed; for what <I>was it</I> proclaimed by him? For the righteous spiritual and worldly <I>existence</I>, (<I>for</I> the benefit of the spiritual and worldly <I>existence</I>). 57. Owing to what desire (owing to what necessity) <I>was</I> the said announcement proclaimed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1773"></A><A HREF="#fn_1725"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> by him? (So that he shall become) the privileged developer, (he who is a resolute ruler). 58. For how many righteous (is it requisite to utter it)? (So that <I>one may</I> become) a developer, (even he who may be) an irresolute ruler&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1774"></A><A HREF="#fn_1726"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (to whom they reveal these words.

IX, contains about 840 Pahlavi words, and represents about 730 words of the original Avesta text in Yas. XIX&#151;XXI, with 1630 in its Pahlavi version, it may be assumed that the detailed account of the whole Nask, extending to nearly 11,000 words, indicates about 9,500 words of Avesta text and 21,200 of Pahlavi version as the total extent of this Nask.</P>
