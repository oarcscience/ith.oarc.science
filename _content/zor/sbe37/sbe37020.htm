About the seven kinds of symptoms of unconsciousness, and separate decisions about assaults that adults may commit among those who are children; also as regards an assault which proceeds to pain <I>and</I> blood, and as regards that <I>in</I> which the duration of the disposition of wrath abates the pain <I>and</I> blood.</p>  
<p>3.

<p>5. About a weapon seizable, and a weapon one brings, there is this, namely, what is the thing which is imperfect (anas<I>p</I>&ocirc;r&icirc;k) as a weapon, what is that which is not, and what is that which is welcome as a weapon; what is that which, when any one forces it back at any one as a weapon, is itself something annoying to him; what is his natural annoyance and what his imparted; and the penalty in property and difference of sentence on a man who is carrying a weapon, due to any weapon he has to carry away.</p>  
<p>6.

<p>in conflict, it then occurs when <I>one has</I> stood up for beginning <I>it</I> and the assault is committed, <I>on</I> one by the other, <I>and</I> not before. 7. And this, too, that engaging in conflict occurs <I>as regards</I> adult with adult, childless women with childless women, pregnant women with pregnant women, and children of seven years with children of seven years&#151;<I>but</I>, as regards children of seven years in sight of <I>their</I> fathers, it becomes an engaging in conflict of the fathers&#151;and the decision about it is this, that the atonement for every sin which may be committed through engaging in conflict goes to the priestly authorities.</p>  
<p>8. About the affliction <I>of</I> a pure lord who sees any one <I>who</I> has been useless (ab&ucirc;n) unto <I>his</I> slave, though the slave is beseeching, and does not contend for <I>his</I> ownership. 9.
