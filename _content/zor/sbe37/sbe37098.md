### CHAPTER XLIX.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The third fargar*d* is the YêNhê-hâtãm <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[4](#fn_1219): there is here taught by it the
worship of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, which is the law of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, that is,
its law is virtuous <span id="fr_1233"></span>[5](#fn_1220). 2. This,
too, that the worship of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is occasioned by it, which is the
asking for life for beings *by* mankind <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[5](#fn_1220). 3. *And* this, too, that the ritual
of the males and females of the righteous occurs *through* it, which is
the obeisance for the archangels <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[6](#fn_1221). 4. And the atonement

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

*for* crimes (va*g*agânŏ), because it is a gratification, is all for
Aûha*r*ma*zd* personally therefrom; and in connection therewith it
amounts to a gratification for Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

5\. Here *one* mentions three particulars <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1](#fn_1222) which are in one's worship of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* of every description. 6. One is when the design (dâ*d*ŏ)
of the person is virtuous, because it is restrained by some virtuousness
of thought; this is that which amounts to worship and obeisance *for*
Aûha*r*ma*zd* personally. 7. One is when it teaches an asking for life
for mankind, and its ordinance is the protection, nourishment, *and*
other assistance *and* gratification *of* mankind; a friend of the
primitive worldly creation of mankind produced it, *and* it comes into
connection *with* the bridge *judgment* of mankind, for the worship
*and* gratification of Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 8. *And* one is when *one* would
celebrate the obeisance *for* the archangels, which is for the sake of
strengthening the archangels, each separately, in *their* control of the
business of preparing *and* managing the world; because *it* is declared
by revelation *that* to worship is this, that the ceremonial *may* reach
this bridge <span id="fr_1237"></span>[2](#fn_1223) in company with
*one* (pa*d*vand), for the worship *and* gratification of Aûha*r*ma*zd*;
the archangel who is to be strengthened by the ceremonial is one, *and*
mankind are developed by the strength of the archangel.

9\. Of righteousness perfect is the excellence.
