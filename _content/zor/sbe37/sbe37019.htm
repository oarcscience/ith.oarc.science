<p>1. The beginning of the law is the N&icirc;k&acirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;m&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of thirty fargar<I>d</I>s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 2. The section Patk&acirc;r-ra<I>d</I>ist&acirc;n ('<I>magistrate code</I>')&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is about this, that the ruin <I>and</I> misery (ay&ocirc;yak&icirc;h) from the destroyer, for mankind and animals, occurring really apart from the spiritual <I>existence</I>, have arisen through the sinfulness even of</p>

<p><A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A></p>  
<p>mankind; <I>and</I> the progress of ruin and misery in the world is owing to unauthorisedly assaulting one another. 3. Advice. to mankind about abstaining therefrom, <I>with</I> an estimate of an authorised assault, <I>and</I>, again, for a slight assault and no assault. 4. To stand magisterially, even opposed to the unmagisterial, with freedom from hurt and loss to oneself; <I>and</I> to abstain altogether, likewise, from the most innocuous (anakhr&ucirc;g&ucirc;n&ocirc;tam) assault even upon an unmagisterial <I>person</I>.</p>  
<p>5. <I>In</I> all magisterial investigation (patk&acirc;r-ra<I>d</I>&icirc;h)&#151;of which, when the custom that exists is established judicially, the substance is two statements, which are verbal and demonstrable, that subsist in different combinations&#151;<I>there</I> are four species: the verbal and demonstrable, the verbal which is not demonstrable, the demonstrable <I>which</I> is not verbal, <I>and that which is</I> neither verbal nor yet demonstrable. 6. In the arguments (s&acirc;m&acirc;n) which are allotted <I>as</I> verbal are four species, the dispute <I>having</I> different arguments <I>and</I> different assertions which are for unmagisterial investigation, for one's own priestly authority (ra<I>d</I>&#335;), for another good man&#151;three of such being requisite&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#151;and also for other evidence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 7. And in those which are allotted as demonstrable are six species, and for an unmagisterial <I>person</I> the assertions, like the previous species which are on the same subject, are twelve&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 8. Of</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A></p>  
<p>all unmagisterial proceedings&#151;which, though it be a custom, is to proceed unauthorisedly&#151;the species are five&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which consist in <I>having</I> demonstrated, getting upon, striking&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>having</I> caused a wound, and <I>having</I> slain.</p>  
<p>9: Of <I>those</I> subject to the magistrate (patk&acirc;r-ra<I>d</I>&#335;-h&ocirc;m&ocirc;nd) the twelve species are divided into four sections of three each. 10. One section are the hearing who are seeing, they to whom a dispute which is verbal [is demonstrable; the hearing who are not seeing, they to whom a dispute which is verbal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>] is not demonstrable; and the seeing who are not hearing, they to whom even a dispute which is demonstrable is not verbal. 11. And with these three, who are in one section, there is magisterial investigation; and the magistrate, unless (ba<I>r</I>&acirc; hat)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> risk for the body <I>be</I> certain, is then irresistible; which is as though it be said <I>that</I> to restrain by</p>

<p>wounding (r&ecirc;sh) is not justifiable, <I>but</I> the decision therein is this, that, when they do not change through lawful litigation, and they cannot hold back without wounding, <I>it</I> is justifiable to keep <I>them</I> back even by wounding. 12. One section are the not hearing who are also not seeing, the women, and the children; and with these three, who are in one section, there is no magisterial investigation; and the decision <I>as to</I> the bodies thereof is this, that, unless risk for the body <I>be</I> certain from their complete change, they are then to be completely changed (ba<I>r</I>&acirc; var<I>d</I>i<I>s</I>n&#335;). 13. One section are the foreigner and <I>him</I> worthy of death, certain of thereby producing a sentence for <I>being</I> executed from the judges; <I>also</I> the highwayman, when he stays on the highway and his destruction is proclaimed, <I>but</I> it is not possible to effect <I>it</I>. 14. With these three, likewise, who are in one section, there is no magisterial investigation, but the decision about them is even this, that when <I>one</I> is utterly destroying their life, <I>one</I> is thereby possessing merit. 15. One section are they who are walking, <I>or</I> coming upon <I>one</I>, unseasonably, <I>or</I> retreating confused into a rugged place, <I>and</I>, when <I>people</I> ask them to speak, <I>they</I> are giving no answer, <I>and</I> they are not suspicious as foreigners. 16. With these three, likewise, who are in one section, there is no magisterial investigation, and the decision about them is this, that when <I>one</I> kills them outright, <I>one</I> does not become sinful thereby.</p>  
<p>17. <I>As to</I> whatever is on the same subject it introduces many opinions, and also this, that a counter-assault (<I>a</I><I>v</I><I>&acirc;</I><I>z</I>-zatam) is that which becomes a blow and wound, <I>and</I> is to be so committed when it</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is possible to produce <I>them</I> again exactly in every single particular.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_129"></A><A HREF="sbe37019.htm#fr_130">35:2</A> Corresponding to the fifteenth word, khshathrem<I>k</I>&acirc;, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the sixteenth Nask in other Riv&acirc;yats. This name should probably be V&icirc;k-<I>a</I><I>&icirc;</I>t-t&ucirc;m, meaning 'the most separate concerns,' as the Nask refers chiefly to public law; but it is called Niy&acirc;ram, or Niy&acirc;d&acirc;m, in the Riv&acirc;yats.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_130"></A><A HREF="sbe37019.htm#fr_131">35:3</A> The Riv&acirc;yats say fifty-four kardah, which number may have been obtained by adding the 'twenty-four particulars,' mentioned in Chap. XX, 1, to the thirty fargar<I>d</I>s stated here.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_131"></A><A HREF="sbe37019.htm#fr_132">35:4</A> The patk&acirc;r-ra<I>d</I>, or settler of disputes, appears to have held a position somewhere between an arbitrator and a judge, and which may be approximately defined as that of a magistrate.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_132"></A><A HREF="sbe37019.htm#fr_133">36:1</A> Evidently referring to arbitrators with an umpire.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_133"></A><A HREF="sbe37019.htm#fr_134">36:2</A> Reading han&#335; g&ocirc;k&acirc;y&icirc;h, but han&#335; is an unusual form. Perhaps ag&ocirc;k&acirc;y&icirc;h, 'want of evidence,' would be more suitable to the context.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_134"></A><A HREF="sbe37019.htm#fr_135">36:3</A> So the MS., but 'four' would suit the context better, and the two Pahlavi ciphers do not differ much in shape.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_135"></A><A HREF="sbe37019.htm#fr_136">37:1</A> These five grades of unauthorised retribution are analogous to the five grades of personal outrage mentioned in Vend. IV, 17.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_136"></A><A HREF="sbe37019.htm#fr_137">37:2</A> Pahl. zatam, 'a blow, assault, striking,' is used throughout, instead of z&acirc;kham (Pers. za&#145;<I>h</I>m), which latter word does not occur in these two books of the Dinka<I>r</I><I>d</I>, except in the form zakham&icirc;-hastan&#335; in Bk. IX, Chap. VIII, 6. The Farhang-&icirc; O&icirc;m-a&ecirc;vak also uses zat&ocirc;m in the same sense, in its oldest MSS.; and Dd. V, 1 has zatam. Darmesteter suggests that zatam and z&acirc;kham are both traceable to an original zathma, or zathema.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_137"></A><A HREF="sbe37019.htm#fr_138">37:3</A> The words in brackets are omitted by mistake in the MS.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_138"></A><A HREF="sbe37019.htm#fr_139">37:4</A> The ambiguity, mentioned in the latter clause of this section, appears to lie in these words, which mean either 'but if' or 'only if.' Such ambiguity must have existed in the original Pahlavi text of the Nask, and probably indicates that the earlier part of this section is a summary of the Pahlavi version of the original Avesta text, while the latter part is a summary of the Pahlavi commentary upon that version. As the same ambiguity occurs, without comment, in &sect; 12, where the meaning seems tolerably certain, it is doubtful if the commentator's opinion can be adopted.</P>
