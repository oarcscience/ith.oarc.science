### CHAPTER LXV.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The nineteenth fargar*d*, Ka*d*-môi-urvâ <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[4](#fn_1457), is *that* the sheep-nature
(pâhîh) <span id="fr_1494"></span>[5](#fn_1458) is taught to him *who*

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

*is* a sheep (gôs*p*end), even for this reason, because the sheep is
still among sheep (pâh-i*k* dên). 2. This, too, that by him who provides
pasture for sheep, mankind are nourished (srayinî*d*ŏ) <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[1](#fn_1459) through the sheep; even for this
reason, because the nourishment of mankind is through the sheep, and
*that* of the sheep through pasture. 3. This, too, that the sheep of the
present *worldly* state is expounded to him who is a sheep (pâh) to
Zaratû*s*t, that is, he has Zaratû*s*t as a high-priest; even for this
reason, because still a sheep (pâh-i*k*) is a sheep.

4\. This, too, that strength in virtue is increased *and* taught by him
who produces joyfulness <span id="fr_1496"></span>[2](#fn_1460) through
seeking gradual development, so that he would do that thing which gives
him joyfulness, that is, he would do that thing which becomes his
long-continued joy; even for this reason, because increase of strength
arises more particularly from pleasure, the pleasure that *one is*
gradually attaining (dêr-pa*d*âî). 5. This, too, that by him who shall
provide the ceremonial of the sacred beings, the joyfulness <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[2](#fn_1460) owing to the sacred beings is then
connected with his own; even for this reason, because the coming of the
sacred beings to it occurs.

6\. This, too, that the wisdom <span id="fr_1498"></span>[3](#fn_1461)
of Zaratû*s*t is taught *and* displayed by him who gives thought to the
religion of Zaratû*s*t. 7. This, too, that the tongue <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[3](#fn_1461) is instructed (farhân*g*înî*d*ŏ) in
speech by him who becomes discriminating through wisdom. 8. And this,
too, that preparation <span id="fr_1500"></span>[4](#fn_1462) is taught
to them who are benefiters of Zaratû*s*t, *or* who are so of the
religion; even for this reason, because, owing to

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

that action, disposition, and attraction which are now theirs, they
prepare mankind for the religion of Zaratû*s*t. 9. This, too, that
whoever teaches the virtuous way to others, they become his through the
knowledge of being instructed; even for this reason, because through the
enlightenment of that way, they see and act, and are thereby instructed.

10\. This, too, that the obeisance <span
id="fr_1501"></span>[1](#fn_1463) *for* the archangels is performed by
him who is a praiser *of* the archangels. 11. This, too, that assistance
is taken <span id="fr_1502"></span>[2](#fn_1464) from the sacred beings
by him who gives to him who is a supplicant that which is dear to him,
because he himself is macle worthy by his assistance, and, when made
worthy by it, it is then taken by him; and the supplicant is he who is
not a supplicant through his mouth, but through worthiness, and what is
dear is that which is good about him.

12\. This, too, that *its being* within the day till dawn (va*l*
aûsh) <span id="fr_1503"></span>[3](#fn_1465) is taught by him—that is,
he would make it as a signal (dakhshakŏ) <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[3](#fn_1465)—who is in obeisance, so that he *may*
not neglect till another day the duty and good works which it is
requisite for him to perform within the day; even for this reason,
because to cause the preservation of the dawn from debased
incompatibility (hêr hanbêshîh) of duties, it is made exalted by him
over the duties. 13. This, too, that complete mindfulness is taught
among the existences <span id="fr_1505"></span>[4](#fn_1466) by him
whose thought among the existences is that he shall perform that thing
which is possible to remain good in the world, such as the provision of
good sovereignty, orthodoxy, the

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

law of virtuous usage, *and* others, through which the dwelling,
preparation, and living of mankind in the world arise, *and* the
appropriation of any complete mindfulness of that performer is the
exaltation which is his owing to that great performance.

14\. It is righteousness *that is* perfect excellence.

<span id="fn_1457"></span>[376:4](sbe37114.htm#fr_1493) See Chap. XX, 1
n; it is here written ka*d*-môk-ravŏ in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_1458"></span>[376:5](sbe37114.htm#fr_1494) See Pahl. Yas.
XLIX, 1 b. The distinction made in the Pahlavi text, here and in § 3, by
using the scriptural term pâh and the general word gôspend for the
sheep, might perhaps be imitated in English by using the word 'flock'
for pâh, but this would not express the meaning exactly.
