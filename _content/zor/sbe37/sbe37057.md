### CHAPTER VIII.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The seventh fargar*d*, Tâ-v*e*-urvâtâ <span

the exhibition to Zaratû*s*t of the nature of the four periods in the
millennium of Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_516"></span>[1](sbe37058.htm#fn_512). 2. First, the golden, that
in which Aûha*r*ma*zd* displayed the religion to Zaratû*s*t. 3. Second,
the silver, that in which Vi*s*tâsp <span
id="fr_517"></span>[2](sbe37058.htm#fn_513) received the religion from
Zaratû*s*t. 4. Third, the steel, the period within which the organizer
of righteousness, Âtû*r*pâ*d* <span
id="fr_518"></span>[3](sbe37058.htm#fn_514) son of Mâ*r*aspend, was
born. 5. Fourth, the period mingled with iron is this, in which is much
propagation of the authority of the apostate and other villains, as
regards the destruction of the reign of religion, the weakening of every
kind *of* goodness *and* virtue, and the disappearance of honour and
wisdom from the countries of Irân. 6. In the same period is an account
of the many perplexities and torments (zakhamî-hastanŏ) of the period
for that desire of the life of the good which subsists in seemliness.

7\. Perfect righteousness is excellence.
