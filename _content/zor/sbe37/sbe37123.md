#### CHAPTER CLXV.

1\. About the purport of the evidence *of* the three codes of the
Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion, one as regards the other, there is verbal
evidence of the Gâthic from the Hadha-mãthric and the Law, and about the
Hadha-mãthric and the Law from the Gâthas. 2. The purport, too, of the
statement *that* occurs is this of a ruler putting aside the commands of
an enemy—which are declared, *in* many passages (dîvâk) of the
Hadha-mãthric and even of the Legal, *to be* worthiness of death—the
purport *being* in the words of a Gâthic phrase (nisang) *that* is

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

even this:—'He who is a good ruler is a desire *and* bringing on of
fortune for me (va*l*am) <span id="fr_1654"></span>[1](#fn_1613).' 3.
All rulers also for the world have arisen *for* their own, and for
maintaining him who is high-priest; they are submissive, and *any one*
accomplishing their commands—which are putting aside the commands of
their enemy—is, owing to their submissiveness, authorisedly maintaining
his own person and wealth *in* the world thereby, *and* in the world
there is no place, *nor* yet a share of anything therefrom, on account
of which he becomes offended by the world.

4 The evidence of the Hadha-mãthric and of the Legal about a Gâthic
statement is the purport *of* these words in a Gâthic phrase, that 'not
*for* him who is rightly proceeding is *there* further ruin <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[2](#fn_1614);' *and* the evidence from the
Hadha-mãthric is even this which states that 'rectitude assists a man
like a regiment a thousand strong <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[3](#fn_1615);' also for the proportion of rectitude
in *his* possession there is no disturbance whatever, and from the
hurtful (vinâsîgânŏ) from without *he* is thus protected, because
fully-worshipping (pûr-y*az*ân) performance is freedom from danger from
the want of freedom from wickedness (*a*-adarvandîh) of the enemy, as
regards benefit, through the doing of injury by him.

5\. And on account of the superior knowledge of the spiritual
*existence*, moreover, for the Gâthas, above the intermediate
Hadha-mãthric *and* the lower knowledge of the Law, the purpose of the
Gâthic *was* for the statements of the Legal *and* the *Hadha-*mãthric,
and the provision of the Hadha-mãthric

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

*and* the Legal was evidently for the statements of the Gâthas.

6\. One <span id="fr_1657"></span>[1](#fn_1616) is *that*, on account of
him who gave the Legal, and is *a*lso the protector of a priestly master
who is given over to the Hadha-mãthric, and the Gâthic, through which
the purity of the good creations arises, *one* is more steadfastly to
aggrandise and develope *them*.     .     .     .     .     .     .

<span id="fn_1616"></span>[410:1](sbe37123.htm#fr_1657) This is the
fourth of 'the ten admonitions of the righteous *S*ênôv about the law of
the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion.' In the seventh book of the Dinka*rd*
it is stated that as regards the high-priests this, too, is said on the
subject of *S*ênôv, that one hundred years of the religion elapse when
*S*ênôv is born, and two hundred years when he passes away; he was also
the first Ma*zd*a-worshipper with a life of a hundred years (100 khayâ),
and who walks forth upon this earth with a hundred disciples.' This last
clause clearly identifies him with the 'Saêna, *son* of Ahûm-stu*d*, who
first appeared upon this earth with a hundred pupils,' as stated in Yt.
XIII, 97 (see Darmesteter, *Textes pehlvis relatifs au Judaisme*,
première partie, p. 3, n. 2).
