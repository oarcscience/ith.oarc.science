### CHAPTER XLVIII.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The second fargar*d* is the Ashem <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[2](#fn_1212) of the Bakân <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[3](#fn_1213); it is by it *that* perfect excellence
is produced for every one who produces for any one else that which is
suitable for him <span id="fr_1227"></span>[4](#fn_1214); for this
reason, because, for the sake of perfect production, *there is* much
unprofitable production, *but* profitable production is suitably
producing. 2. This, too, that the reward of every good work is given by
it to mankind, which keeps mankind in diligence when it instructs <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[5](#fn_1215); because, as the business *of* all
good works is that which instructs and keeps mankind in diligence, the
reward of good works which mankind

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

can appropriate by diligence is appropriated by it. 3. And this, too,
that advancement is given by it to every good work <span
id="fr_1229"></span>[1](sbe37098.htm#fn_1216).

4\. He who is understanding good works, and *yet* a suppliant, has
thereby made the learned foolish (*âz*ân akhanî*d*înî*d*ŏ); whoever
possesses authority through virtuousness <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[2](sbe37098.htm#fn_1217) is more particularly for
rewarding the doers of good works; whoever, too, can make true
decision <span id="fr_1231"></span>[3](sbe37098.htm#fn_1218) and
adjudication is more particularly for causing the bridge *judgment* of a
criminal, and *for* thrusting *him* aside owing to the exhaustion of
*his* good works; and whoever, too, can exercise mediation *and* wisdom
is more particularly for the good government of the world.

5\. Of righteousness the excellence is perfect.
