<p align="center"><I>Bak&#335; Nask</I>.</p>  
<p>1. The fifteenth fargar<I>d</I>, Kamnama&ecirc;za&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1442"></A><A HREF="#fn_1409"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is about the reply of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, as to that which <I>was</I> asked by him thus: 'To which lands do I step&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1443"></A><A HREF="#fn_1410"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?' <I>and</I> it is <I>thus:</I> 'Do thou march (sag&icirc;t&ucirc;n) there where the man, in whose person righteousness is <I>connected</I> with complete mindfulness, is welcome; this, too, is where happy is he from whom there is no complaint.'</p>  
<p>2. This, too, that mankind are made diligent in good works by him who produces progress for good works; even for this reason, because mankind attain progress <I>in</I> manifest duty who engage more particularly <I>in</I> good works. 3. This, too, that the teaching of religion is the public action which is prescribed by him who would produce exertion for the righteous, that is, benefit for those of the good religion; even for this reason, because the multitude (kabed&acirc;n) approach the religion, and are taught and practise <I>it</I>, on account of a desire <I>for</I> benefit. 4. This, too, that <I>it is</I> in a province of even exhausted production&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1444"></A><A HREF="#fn_1411"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> that it is taught by him who appoints a virtuous governor over the province; even for this reason, because a virtuous governor of a province becomes a teacher of ability and good works to those of the province.</p>  
<p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_368"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 368</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. This, too, that the good protection of fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1445"></A><A HREF="#fn_1412"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is taught by him whose words are through Voh&ucirc;man, <I>and</I> who also would provide a time for the ordeal of that which is doubtful; even for this reason, because <I>he</I> whose words are utterable through Voh&ucirc;man, <I>and</I> who would provide a time <I>for</I> the ordeal of that which is doubtful, teaches the provision of care <I>for</I> the operative fire, owing to that <I>which occurs</I> when <I>what is</I> accomplished, about one acquitted <I>or</I> convicted <I>by</I> the fire, is declared, <I>and</I> mankind shall provide more particularly for the brilliancy of the fire, and the wicked more <I>for</I> assistance and protection from it.</p>  
<p>6. This, too, that whoever shall provide about him who liberally gives <I>him</I>self in discipleship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1446"></A><A HREF="#fn_1413"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> unto the priests, has thereby taught even by the mention of the high-priest; even for this reason, because the person <I>being</I> given in discipleship unto the priests, the religion practised by the high-priest arises also <I>for</I> mention, <I>and</I> whoever shall provide generosity for that person, has increased <I>and</I> also taught that action, which is religion, even by the mention made. 7. This, too, that men and women&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1447"></A><A HREF="#fn_1414"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are taught <I>as being</I> given in discipleship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1448"></A><A HREF="#fn_1415"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t by him who keeps his own males and females in the control of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t. 8. This, too, that goodness is taught by him to those (valman) who are good, so that they produce it who give to that righteous <I>one</I> the worthiness which is through that wealth; the righteous <I>one</I> who is worthy is <I>one</I> of the good religion for whose production of the worthiness which is through that wealth it is sought, and that wealth which is</p>

<p><A NAME="page_369"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 369</FONT></A></p>  
<p>coveted is wealth of little trouble <I>and</I> much advantage, through the goodness and idea of virtue of the giver to the account of him who is the accepter of the good worthiness. 9. This, too, that through his <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> passage (<I>K</I>i<I>s</I>-vi<I>d</I>arg) it is taught that they shall step forth (fr&ocirc;v&acirc;m&acirc;nd)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1449"></A><A HREF="#fn_1416"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; <I>and</I> by him who goes on through anything (<I>k</I>is) openly, when he <I>has</I> proceeded publicly on the right path, <I>one</I> passed <I>away</I> on the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> passage is taught.</p>  
<p>10. This, too, that by him whose ceremonial is through complete mindfulness it is taught that the world produces abundance through complete mindfulness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1450"></A><A HREF="#fn_1417"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; even for this reason, because it is taught by him, through that disposition of his <I>for</I> the sacred beings (pavan zak-1 valman ya<I>z</I><I>d</I>&acirc;n&#335; kh&icirc;m), <I>that</I> the developed world is shown <I>to be</I> theirs; <I>and</I> here <I>below</I> it is fully taught by him, <I>that</I> Kh&ucirc;<I>r</I>da<I>d</I> and Am&ucirc;<I>r</I>da<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1451"></A><A HREF="#fn_1418"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>&#151;that is, the sacred beings&#151;produce <I>it</I> for the benefiters. 11. This, too, that thus he who is wicked, even he who is privileged, becomes unprivileged at that time when every one understands, that is, when righteousness is aloft. 12. This, too, that when he who is privileged is Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1452"></A><A HREF="#fn_1419"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, likewise he who is privileged is the righteous Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1453"></A><A HREF="#fn_1420"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> so he who is the wicked Ar<I>g</I>&acirc;sp&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1454"></A><A HREF="#fn_1421"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> is unprivileged.</p>  
<p>13. This, too, that creation is taught by him to</p>

And this, too, that wisdom is taught to him who is Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&#151;so that it becomes his&#151;by him whose thoughts are for Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1456"></A><A HREF="#fn_1423"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>and</I> for the religion of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t.</p>
