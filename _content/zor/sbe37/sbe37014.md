### CHAPTER XI.

1\. The Vi*s*tâsp-sâstô <span id="fr_84"></span>[3](#fn_83) is about
particulars of

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

every kind *relating* to Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_84); the temper, character, demeanour,
knowledge, learning, and law for sovereignty; the government of the
creatures, *and* the advancement of the will of the sacred beings
requisite for it.

2\. The creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* sends the archangels <span
id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_85) on to Kai -Vi*s*tâsp as evidence about
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, *and* a reminder of Spîtâmân Zaratû*s*t, *of* the pure
goodness of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion, *and of* the command for
the ruler Vi*s*tâsp, as to *its* triumph, on accepting the religion from
Zaratû*s*t. 3. The visible coming of the archangels to the metropolis,
and, secondly, *their* domestication (handêmânîh) at the residence *of*
Vi*s*tâsp and his companions; the envoys’ explanation of Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s
message to Vi*s*tâsp, *and* the accepting of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping
religion *by* the obedient king Vi*s*tâsp.

4\. The outpouring (sârînî*d*anŏ) of Ar*g*âsp the Khyôn <span
id="fr_87"></span>[3](#fn_86), by the demon of wrath, for war with
Vi*s*tâsp

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

*and* disturbance of Zaratû*s*t; the arrangements *and* movements of
king Vi*s*tâsp for that war, *and* whatever is on the same subject.

5\. Excellence *that is* perfect is righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_83"></span>[23:3](sbe37014.htm#fr_84) Corresponding to the
tenth word, dazdâ, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is
the eleventh Nask in other Rivâyats. <span id="page_24">p. 24</span>
Vi*s*tâsp-sâstô means 'the instruction of Vi*s*tâsp,' and is corrupted
into Vi*s*tâsp-shâh, Vi*s*tâspâd, or Vi*s*tâsp, in the Rivâyats, which
also state that it contained originally sixty kardah, or ʓûrat, of which
only ten, or eight, were recovered after the time of Alexander. The last
number refers, no doubt, to the eight fargar*d*s still extant under the
corrupt name Vi*s*tâsp Ya*s*t, which probably consist of fragments of
the Avesta text of this Nask; but in comparing that text with this
description it must be remembered that the author is describing the
contents of the Pahlavi version which would contain much commentary.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[24:1](sbe37014.htm#fr_85) The king of Iran in
the time of Zaratû*s*t, who accepted the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion;
the last king of the old history derived from the Avesta (see Chap.
XIII, 15, 16).

<span id="fn_85"></span>[24:2](sbe37014.htm#fr_86) Compare Vi*s*tâsp Yt.
40.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[24:3](sbe37014.htm#fr_87) The 'deadly *Hv*yaona
Are*g*a*d*-aspa' of Yt. IX, 30, XVII, 50, whom Kavi Vî*s*tâspa prayed to
be delivered from. According to the Yâ*d*kâr-î Zarîrân, Ar*g*âsp, king
of the Khyôns, made war upon <span id="page_25">p. 25</span> Vi*s*tâsp
on account of the latter's conversion to Ma*zd*a-worship and was
defeated with great difficulty in a most desperate battle which is also
described in the Shâhnâmah. Whether the Khyôns were the Chionitae of
later times is uncertain.
