<IMG SRC="img/07801.jpg"> once, in this Book, but its reading is not quite certain. It means 'shepherd' throughout Chaps. XXIII, XXXIX, and in XXXI, 17, 31, XL, 3; but is used for 'herdsman' in XXXIX, 3, and for 'follower' in XXXI, 2. This last meaning is strongly in favour of the reading pas&icirc;g, for pas&icirc;k, 'following,' an adjectival form derived from pas, 'after,' which, when used as a noun, would imply 'one who follows,' as drovers and shepherds are accustomed to do, with a few local exceptions. The Pahlavi spelling of the word is uniformly inconsistent with the reading p&acirc;s, 'guard, protector;' and it seems hazardous to trace it to a possible Avesta adjective pasvya, from pasu, 'a sheep,' because the latter word becomes p&acirc;h in Pahlavi. The word also occurs in Pahl. Vend. XV, 116; it is a transcript of Av. fsh<I>e</I>ngh&icirc; and fsh<I>e</I>nghy&ocirc; in Yas. XXXI, 10 b, XLIX, 9 a, and of fsh&ecirc; in Vend. XIII, 10, 11; so that it may perhaps be read fsheg, or fsh&ecirc;, as a mere transcript from the Avesta.</P>
