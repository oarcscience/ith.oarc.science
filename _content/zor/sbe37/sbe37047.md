<span id="fn_359"></span>[152:2](sbe37047.htm#fr_361) Corresponding to
the nineteenth word, drigubyô, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P.
Riv.; but it is the twentieth Nask in other Rivâyats. In the Dinka*rd*
its name is semi-Zvâri*s*, either Gvî*d*-shêdâ-dâ*d* or Vîk-shêdâ-dâ*d*,
the Av. dâta vîdaêva, 'law opposed to the demons.' In the Rivâyats it is
called *G*ud-dêv-dâd, Vendîdâ*d*, or Vîndâd, and is stated to consist of
twenty-two kardah, or fargar*d*s, the number it still contains. It is
generally considered that the Vendîdâ*d* now extant is a collection of
fragments, <span id="page_153">p. 153</span> but it is evident, from the
close correspondence between the author's description and the present
contents, that this fragmentary state of the text existed in his time;
and there is every probability that any mutilation that exists in the
text occurred before Sasanian times. The author, however, sometimes
omits to mention subjects that are repeated, so it is just possible that
some of these repetitions are of later date. He also makes no allusion
to the twelfth fargar*d* (see § 51 n).

<span id="fn_377"></span>[155:3](sbe37047.htm#fr_379) Av. Mithrô, the
angel of the sun's light, friendly to man, and, hence, insisting upon
the fulfilment of every promise (mithrô). He is supposed to keep an
account of all breaches of promise (see Dd. XIV, 3), and to mediate
between the departed soul and its accusers (see Mkh. II, 118); in doing
which he co-operates with the angels of obedience (Srôsh, see Chap. IX,
3 n) and justice (Rashnû, see Chap. XX, 153 n) who estimate and weigh
its good works and sins, and decide upon its fate at the bridge of
judgment.

(Sp.).

<span id="fn_392"></span>[157:2](sbe37047.htm#fr_394) Pâz. dhôvana which
is here assumed to be equivalent to Pers. dô bun. It is probably a
reading of the Pahlavi word <span id="img_15700"></span>
![](img/15700.jpg) or <span id="img_15701"></span> ![](img/15701.jpg) in
Pahl. Vend. V, 169; 172, which has been variously read as *g*û*g*an, 'a
dirham,' dûkŏ, 'a spindle,' or yûkŏ, 'a rag;' the last of which would
best suit the context here.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[158:1](sbe37047.htm#fr_399) Vend. VII, 1-5,
10-16. Nothing is said about VII, 6-9, 17-22 (which passages are merely
a repetition of V, 27-30, 57-62), but this omission may be owing to the
fact that these passages are so abbreviated in the MSS. as to be easily
overlooked, especially by a reader of the Pahlavi version only.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[158:2](sbe37047.htm#fr_400) Vend. VII, 23-26.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[158:3](sbe37047.htm#fr_401) Pahl. tanand
va-mâk (= mêg), evidently equivalent to the Av. sûnô madhakhay*a*us*k*a
of Vend. VII, 26, which are rendered by tûn mêgŏ-*k* in the Pahlavi
version. The identity of Av. madhakha with Pahl. madag, or mêg, Pers.
maîg, mala‘*h* 'a locust,' has long been recognised (see Darmesteter's
Études Iranniennes, II, p. 199). But the meaning of Av. sûn = Pâz. tûn
has been merely guessed to be 'a mosquito;' the Avesta word having been
transcribed as sîn, or sin, in the prose Sad-dar, LXXII, 2, and
explained by the Persian gloss pa*s*ah, 'a gnat or fly,' by some
copyists, while others have read san (for sin) and have substituted its
synonym sâl, 'a year,' or have read bî*s*, 'a poisonous herb,' instead
of pa*s*ah. With regard to the word <span id="img_15800"></span>
![](img/15800.jpg) tanand, 'spider,' in our text, it may be observed
that it has descended from a much older copy of the Pahlavi Vendîdâ*d*
than any that could have been consulted by the author of the Sad-dar,
and it is easy to see how an original Pahl. <span id="img_15801"></span>
![](img/15801.jpg) could have been read <span id="img_15802"></span>
![](img/15802.jpg) in Pâzand by later copyists of the Vendîdâ*d*.

to the legal dakhmas, or depositories for the dead. §§ 51, 52 are

<span id="fn_421"></span>[160:11](sbe37047.htm#fr_424) Vend. IX, 45, 46,
X, 1-20, XI, 1-20 may probably be all alluded to in these few words; but
nothing is said about the twelfth fargar*d*. This omission is singularly
in accordance with the fact <span id="page_161">p. 161</span>that the
same fargar*d* is omitted in all very old copies of the Vendîdâ*d* with
Pahlavi version, in which, although the fargar*d*s are numbered, the
thirteenth immediately follows the eleventh. The Kopenhagen MS. No. 2,
in which the twelfth fargar*d* occurs with a Pahlavi version, is said to
be a revision of the Vendîdâ*d* text compiled in the last century, and
other copies of the Pahlavi twelfth fargar*d* have been derived from
this revised text. The omission of this fargar*d* in all the old MSS.
cannot be satisfactorily attributed to the loss of some folios in an
older copy, because no fargar*d* is likely to fill exactly a certain
number of folios; the loss must also have occurred very shortly after
the last revision of the Pahlavi text, to account for the author of the
Dinka*rd* not finding the Pahlavi of this fargar*d* in the ninth
century.

rods are tied together by a central girdle, passing three times round
them and knotted just like the sacred thread-girdle round the waist of a
Parsi; but this girdle is formed of six threadlike ribbons split out of
a leaflet of the date-palm and twisted together. The bundle, when
properly purified, is laid upon the crescent-shaped tops of two adjacent
metal stands, whence it is taken up by the officiating priest, to hold
in his left hand during certain recitations.
