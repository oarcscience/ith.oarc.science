### CHAPTER XLIII.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The twentieth fargar*d*, Ka*d*-môi-urvâ <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[4](#fn_1121), is about anything whatever *being*
begged *as* provision for the soul <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[5](#fn_1122), and as to the speaking of
Shatraver <span id="fr_1134"></span>[6](#fn_1123) to Zaratû*s*t thus:
'Thou shouldst think thus, *O* Spîtâmân! that Aûha*r*ma*zd* assists
thee.' 2. This, too, *is said*, that the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd* live
through Khû*r*da*d* <span id="fr_1135"></span>[7](#fn_1124), are
immortal through Amû*r*da*d* <span id="fr_1136"></span>[7](#fn_1124),
possess complete mindfulness of Aûha*r*ma*zd* through

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Spenda*r*ma*d* <span id="fr_1137"></span>[1](#fn_1125), and *possess*
him as ruler through Shatraver.

3\. About wealth being *begged* owing to virtuousness *there* is this,
too, that, to him who, owing to virtuousness, begs that which is not
allowed to him owing to the oppressiveness *of* the vile, or on account
of *some* other opposition, they then give essentially that reward, in
the spiritual *existence which is* greater *and* better than that
wealth. 4. About the cattle suitable *for* that warrior who possesses
virtuous habits *and* strength <span id="fr_1138"></span>[2](#fn_1126),
through the assistance of the will of the sacred beings and *for* the
benefit of Irân *and* the defeat of the diminishing foreign force
(kâstârîh-i an-Aîrânŏ).

5\. About the seizure <span id="fr_1139"></span>[3](#fn_1127) of mankind
for the advancement of the admonition *and* command *of* the sacred
beings, so far as force is an assistant to them in knowledge due to the
sacred beings <span id="fr_1140"></span>[4](#fn_1128); *and* their
appropriation *of* the best existence through the advancement of that
admonition *and* command. 6. About the assistance of the righteous, on
the passage to the best existence, by the spirit of the wisdom of
sovereignty, liberality, *and* truth, Aharî*s*vang <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[5](#fn_1129) and the angel Hôm <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[6](#fn_1130).

7\. About the reason of the three steps walked forward *by* the Zôti
from the place of the Zôti, while uttering the Avesta
(*av*istâkŏ-gôbi*s*nîhâ), after the

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

end of the ritual for the fire, on delivering (parv*âz*i*s*nŏ) the
offering of holy-water to the water <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[1](#fn_1131), *being* the leading up of the
archangels, always at the end of an assembly of conference *with*
Zaratû*s*t, by three steps from the earth to the sun station, through
*the places of* good thoughts, good words, *and* good deeds <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[2](#fn_1132).

8\. Advice to Zaratû*s*t also as to the nature of the archangels;
likewise a reminder to worship on *their*

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

account after separation from the sight *of them*. 9. And this, too, *is
said*, that *there* arises therefrom a conception (ham-giriftârîh), *by*
him whose disposition and character are sagacious <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[1](#fn_1133), also as to the adaptation of his own
deeds to that nature of his. 10. And about the good affinity of
Zaratû*s*t, even for abundance of good works, *there* is this, too,
namely: 'So, *for* all those deeds which *thou hast* to accomplish, and
which are also accomplished, there is reward for thee through their
righteousness, *O* Zaratû*s*t!'

11\. And about the advice to Zaratû*s*t *there* is this, too, namely:
'*Thou hast* to become reverent to them <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[2](#fn_1134), so that mankind *may* become reverent
to thee.' 12. About considering the time of the days *and* nights *as*
all for good accumulation in good works *there* is this, too, that
whoever is diligent *and* always doing good works, *and* that whoever
shall perform as many good works as is possible for him, is given as
much reward <span id="fr_1147"></span>[3](#fn_1135) as is his desire.

13\. It is righteousness *that is* perfect excellence.

repetition of §§ 6-11 of this Gâthic hâ (Yas. L-XLIX of the Pahlavi
version). These proceedings are detailed in the rubrics, partially in J2

taken up from the Mâh-rû,' or crescent-topped Barsôm-stand, '*and* one
step is to be set forth in the direction of the Frabar*d*âr' (the
imaginary assistant priest whose station is near the north-east corner
of the ceremonial area, or to the left of the Zôti, see Chap. XXXIII, 5
n), '*at* this place *of* taking up the Barsôm from the Barsôm-stand,
*and of* going on to the position of the Frabar*d*âr, a beginning of
Yas. L, 8 a is to be made in walking towards the beginning of the fire

(the imaginary assistant priest whose station is near the south-east
corner, so that the progress of the Zôti towards the fire is along the
left-hand side of the ceremonial area), and, after reciting the rest of
the Gâthic text to the end of Yas. L, 11 d, 'homage is to be offered to
