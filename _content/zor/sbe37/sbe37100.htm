<p>1. The fifth fargar<I>d</I>, Khshmaiby&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1261"></A><A HREF="#fn_1242"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is about this, that complaint is made by G&ocirc;<I>s</I>-a&ucirc;rvan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1262"></A><A HREF="#fn_1243"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>that there</I> did not exist <I>any one</I> who properly keeps the cattle that are in his possession; even for this reason, because cattle are increased by such, and others, through design (&acirc;hang) and a desire for that increase, act by his example <I>and</I> keep cattle properly; <I>but</I> the complaint of G&ocirc;<I>s</I>-a&ucirc;rvan is <I>that</I> he does not exist. 2. This, too, that by him who gives orders about the advancement <I>of</I> the concerns of the sacred beings, the care of cattle is produced, and his soul attains to the sacred beings; even for this reason, because the care of cattle is a principal thing in the advancement of the concerns of the sacred beings, <I>and</I> also for the preservation <I>of</I> the soul. 3. This, too, that by him who keeps cattle with a controller (dast&ocirc;bar) who is a cattle-master&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1263"></A><A HREF="#fn_1244"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, even a friend of him who is the creator of cattle is taught to the cattle&#151;the cattle-master and he who is wise in the nourishment, protection, and multiplication of cattle&#151;even for this reason, because when his cattle are kept with a controller who is a nourisher, protector, and multiplier of cattle, the friendship of a nourisher for the nourished, <I>of</I> a protector for the protected, and <I>of</I> a multiplier for the multipliable is also exhibited by him; <I>and</I> the design of the creator for the creation, through affection, is that of a nourisher for the nourished, <I>of</I> a protector for the protected, <I>and of</I> a multiplier for the multipliable.</p>

<p><A NAME="page_319"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 319</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. This, too, that by him who maintains an animal with propriety, it is presented to the sacred beings; even for this reason, because when <I>it</I> is maintained by him with propriety, the will of the sacred beings drives him on, and when the will of the sacred beings drives him on, it is presented by him to the sacred beings. 5. This, too, that when <I>one</I> shall admit the male of animals at the <I>proper</I> time, the mastery (sa<I>r</I>d&acirc;r&icirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>an&#335;) of the animal is also taught by him; even for this reason, because the admission of the male <I>of</I> the animals is the essential business in the multiplication of cattle, and he who is a multiplier has also taught the mastery of the animals. 6. This, too, that by him who does not slaughter an animal until it attains to full growth, the formation of a store for cattle is also taught; even for this reason, because, from the increasing cattle produced, the profit of mankind arises, <I>and</I> on account of the liking of mankind for profit, they persevere more fully in cultivating cattle, and provide a store for them.</p>  
<p>7. This, too, that <I>it is he</I> who is the more powerful of beings&#151;that is, strength is what is more in use <I>by</I> him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1264"></A><A HREF="#fn_1245"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#151;whose proceeding is for him who is his own, so that he supplies that which it is necessary to supply; even for this reason, because needful bountifulness <I>to</I> one's own needy ones arises through lawful thoughts, lawful thoughts are provided by expelling greed, lust, wrath, disgrace, envy, <I>and</I> other fiends from the body, and a man expelling a fiend from <I>his</I> body becomes of efficient strength. 8. This, too, that he is a very powerful person, for invocation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1265"></A><A HREF="#fn_1245"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, supplication, and attaining to good works,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A></p>  
<p>who possesses wealth for the high-priest of the priests, who shall also procure decisions and judgment always justly, and who likewise becomes humble <I>and</I> reverent <I>to</I> the good; even for this reason, because the wealth of multitudes of mankind is for maintaining the desires and pleasure of the body, <I>for</I> procuring decisions and judgment whereto their wishes tend, <I>and for</I> others becoming humble and reverent <I>to</I> them even when <I>their</I> design is vicious; <I>but he</I> who possesses wealth <I>for</I> invocation <I>and</I> connection <I>with</I> the wisdom of the religion, through the high-priest of the religion, and shall procure just decisions and judgment, <I>and</I> becomes humble and reverent <I>to</I> the good, is a putter away of that design and <I>one</I> who, through the putting away of that design, becomes a capable <I>and</I> very powerful person.</p>  
<p>9. This, too, that every one is made to persevere at <I>his</I> proper duty, <I>as to</I> any excellent thing, by him who holds the reward of the diligent, as the sacred beings are proceeding <I>with</I> a pure needy <I>one</I>; for this reason, because the toiling of the body of a person at <I>his</I> proper duty is induced <I>by</I> a desire of reward. 10. This, too, that by him whose mouth (y&ocirc;ng)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1266"></A><A HREF="#fn_1246"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and <I>its</I> appliances <I>are</I> for virtue, the possession of Voh&ucirc;man is then explained, through this mode, because the maintenance of the mouth and <I>its</I> appliances as virtuous becomes so, when, through protection and assistance <I>of</I> the good, <I>and</I> defeat and smiting of the vile, the reformation of the world occurs; and this, too, is so, when <I>there is</I> an existence of preparation of the friend of the good and the enemy</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_321"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 321</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the vile, and of friendship of the good and enmity of the vile, through understanding good and evil; and the understanding of good and evil is through possession of Voh&ucirc;man, <I>and</I> that possession of Voh&ucirc;man becomes also an explainer of Voh&ucirc;man.</p>  
<p>11. This, too, that by him who gives commands about the progress of the concerns of the sacred beings, his own knowledge of every kind is also developed; even for this reason, <I>because</I> the command <I>being</I> necessary <I>for</I> the personal duty of the good, they also develope the knowledge of every kind for which that commanding of duty and <I>its</I> auspiciousness are suitable. 12. This, too, that by him who teaches the good, the good work is then appropriated which is also an assistance of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t through speaking of the religion; even for this reason, because, on account of those of the religion of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t who really constitute the renovation <I>of the universe</I>, the speaking connected with Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&#151;through the teaching of the good <I>and</I> teachers not of the same religion&#151;<I>and</I> the assistance through speaking of the religion become the good work appropriated.</p>  
<p>13. This, too, that by him who gives anything to that person who praises the sacred beings <I>and</I> the good, a throne is appropriated <I>in</I> yonder <I>world</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1267"></A><A HREF="#fn_1247"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, even on the mention <I>of it</I>. 14. This, too, that by him who is teaching that which is for the propitious, the damage that is owing to want of resources&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1268"></A><A HREF="#fn_1248"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in religion is shut out of the world; even for this reason, because, owing to that, he increases the resources of religion of every kind, <I>and</I> the advantage</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_322"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 322</FONT></A></p>  
<p>therefrom, in the world. 15. This, too, that by him who is bringing him who is righteous forth to the rulers, for beneficence, the utmost assistance is then afforded; even for this reason, because an expectation of the utmost beneficence is further attached by him to the place of obtainment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1269"></A><A HREF="#fn_1249"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>16. This, too, that by him who gives <I>him</I>self in service unto him who is the supreme king of kings, the way of good thinking&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1270"></A><A HREF="#fn_1250"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>of</I> the assistance of pleasure, and <I>of</I> the production of sovereignty by A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is disclosed to his own; even for this reason, because the original reason of virtue is the worthiness <I>of</I> mankind owing to the creator <I>and</I> their service unto the creator, and, therefore, as he who is a well-ruling monarch is a creator in the worldly <I>existence, and</I> a recompensing (pa<I>d</I>&#335;-dah&acirc;k) leader of the creatures who steadfastly give <I>them</I>selves in service to him, it is then given by him to the creator also; and I teach, besides, <I>that</I> the origin of the virtue of worthiness, which is attached by the creator to his own, is the way that is stated above, and other virtue is also disclosed to his own thereby.</p>  
<p>17. Righteousness is excellence <I>that is</I> perfect.</p>
