<p>1. The eleventh fargar<I>d</I>, the Yasna&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1354"></A><A HREF="#fn_1325"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is <I>that</I> the whole of the good works <I>which are</I> to accomplish, <I>and</I> those, too, which are accomplished&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1355"></A><A HREF="#fn_1326"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, are appropriated <I>by</I> the righteous <I>man</I> who teaches virtue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1356"></A><A HREF="#fn_1327"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to the righteous; even for this reason, of the good works which <I>one</I> accomplishes, <I>and</I> those, too, which are accomplished, <I>there</I> is all one store (anb&acirc;r), from the work (var&#146;<I>z</I>&#335;) of the original good creation even to the renovation <I>of the universe, and</I> ever afresh the teaching of virtue <I>by those</I> who are righteous comes to the accumulation of the righteous and the accomplishment of that store, <I>and</I> they, too, are in possession of that store, <I>in</I> partnership with the other righteous. 2. This, too, that <I>it is</I> because he would do the best for his own&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1357"></A><A HREF="#fn_1328"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, whose meditation of the liturgy is for those who are archangels, and who also maintains, for the assistance of the good, the strength which is his for the existences. 3. And this statement indicates the great participation of any one in that store, because when that store is really an accumulation of work on the way, for the partners in that store who <I>have done</I> more, and also <I>those</I> who <I>have</I> accomplished less, <I>and</I> remains, moreover, in the possession of them all, then, <I>as to</I> those accomplishing more of it, through the original possession of most of that work, and also through that which <I>occurs</I> when the accomplishers have attained to that plenty more particularly owing to their more labour, and likewise through the property, liberally,</p>

<p><A NAME="page_349"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 349</FONT></A></p>  
<p>largely, and lordlily, of those accomplishing more, and the indigence, unafflictedly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1358"></A><A HREF="#fn_1329"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, scantily, and subordinately, of those accomplishing less, <I>it is</I> reasonable to speak of that store as in their possession, and <I>of their</I> superiority <I>as</I> greatly over those accomplishing less. 4. This, too, that his work is good work whose liberality is for the archangels; even for this reason, because through a little labour <I>for</I> the sacred beings, which is itself that liberality, he contributes duty and good works.</p>  
<p>5. This, too, that it becomes best for him, in both existences&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1359"></A><A HREF="#fn_1330"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, who teaches a wishing for living in diligence to mankind; even for this reason, because he is a preserver of them through the wishing for living, and <I>his</I> soul, through the diligence owing to him, attains perfection, here from mankind <I>and in</I> yonder <I>world</I> from the sacred beings. 6. This, too, that the ceremonial and obeisance of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1360"></A><A HREF="#fn_1331"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are performed by him who is in the way of like thinking and like praising of the law of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> with all the worshippers of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>. 7. This, too, that he is in the leadership of his religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1361"></A><A HREF="#fn_1332"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> who makes the knowledge of religion ever afresh; even for this reason, because every item of knowledge which he provides increases some greatness of it. 8. This, too, that he is in the service of his religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1362"></A><A HREF="#fn_1332"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> who demands the knowledge of religion ever afresh; even for this reason, because so long as he demands more, he becomes nearer to a knowledge of religion.</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_350"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 350</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. This, too, that mankind's wishing for life is authorised (dastovar&icirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) by him who authorises the production of anything for mankind; even for this reason, because authority (dast&ocirc;bar&icirc;h) over the production of anything is conjoined with that which is for the wishing for life; so that whosever production of anything is authorisedly, their life is <I>free</I> from any discomfort; and whosever wishing for life is authorisedly, his production of anything is also authorisedly. 10. This, too, that acceptance, hints, and words are given&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1363"></A><A HREF="#fn_1333"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> by him who asks again, that which he does not understand of the religion, from him who does understand; even for this reason, because knowledge is completed through these three <I>things:</I> obtainment, hints, and speaking, and all three are asked again by him who does not understand. 11. This, too, that the words of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1364"></A><A HREF="#fn_1334"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are taught by him who teaches the acceptance, remembrance, and speaking <I>of</I> the religion; even for this reason, because this is the recital of that compendium (hanger<I>d</I>&icirc;k&icirc;h).</p>  
<p>12. This, too, that the care&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1365"></A><A HREF="#fn_1335"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> <I>and</I> reverence of fire are provided by him who is liberal to a fire as regards anything he supplies <I>for</I> the care <I>and</I> reverence which <I>others</I> shall provide <I>for</I> the fire, and he becomes equally rewarded for it. 13. This, too, that by him who teaches the religion of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> with joyfulness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1366"></A><A HREF="#fn_1336"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, the care <I>and</I> reverence of fire are</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A></p>  
<p>provided as declared by the religion; even for this reason, because even that <I>which is</I> taught by him combines with the action due to that teaching. 14. This, too, that the obeisance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1367"></A><A HREF="#fn_1337"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <I>to</I> those requiring obeisance is arranged <I>by him</I> who loves Voh&ucirc;man. 15. This, too, that fire is strengthened&#151;for that work, achieved in the future existence, which is the greatest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1368"></A><A HREF="#fn_1338"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that exists&#151;by him who invokes fire with the title of fire; even for this reason, because the title is put by him upon a nature that is laudable, and when invoked by him with that title the praised <I>one</I> is then strengthened by him.</p>  
<p>16. This, too, that he becomes informed as to the religion of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1369"></A><A HREF="#fn_1339"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, who teaches the religion of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> with pleasure; even for this reason, because every knowledge is exercised <I>and</I> increased by teaching. 17. This, too, that A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is propitiated by the excellent sagacity of him who teaches virtuous words and actions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1370"></A><A HREF="#fn_1340"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; even for this reason, because sagacity <I>has</I> two parts, the speakable and the workable. 18. This, too, that the bodily form (kerp&#335;) of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is praised as perfection (n&ecirc;vak&#335;t&ucirc;m&icirc;h)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1371"></A><A HREF="#fn_1341"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> by him who elevates (b&acirc;list&icirc;n&ecirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) his own soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1372"></A><A HREF="#fn_1342"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> to the station of the sun&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1373"></A><A HREF="#fn_1343"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>; even for this reason, because that bodily form of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> exists, and becomes the loftiest <I>and</I> most perfect in the station of the sun.</p>  
<p>19. This, too, that all excellence is purely produced for A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> by him who has root in the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_352"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 352</FONT></A></p>  
<p>possession <I>of</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; even for this reason, because, when a root is given to him, fruit is also produced by him, and all excellence is <I>both</I> root and fruit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1374"></A><A HREF="#fn_1344"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 20. This, too, that A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is invoked with the title 'lord&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1375"></A><A HREF="#fn_1345"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>' by him whom A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> calls; even for this reason, because the interpretation of 'A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>' is really with <I>the words</I> 'greatly wise lord' (mas d&acirc;n&acirc;k kh&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;&icirc;). 21. This, too, that the names of the sacred beings <I>which are</I> invoked&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1376"></A><A HREF="#fn_1346"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are the praise glorified by <I>any</I> one, and by him who glorifies them they are named; even for this reason, because the names of the sacred beings are the glorification due to their names of praise. 22. This, too, that among those of the same class (ham-g&ocirc;har&acirc;n), when he shall do <I>it</I> for one race&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1377"></A><A HREF="#fn_1347"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, benefit is produced by him for other races within that class; among those of the same races (ham-t&ocirc;khmak&acirc;n&acirc;n), when he shall produce benefit for one species, <I>it is done</I> by him also for other species within that race; and among the same species (ham sar&acirc;<I>d</I>ak&#335;), when&#160; he shall produce benefit for one individual (kerp&#335;), <I>it is done</I> by him for other individuals within that species.</p>  
<p>23. This, too, that his personality (kh&ucirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;h) is the sacred beings&#146; own&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1378"></A><A HREF="#fn_1348"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, who maintains the rites&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1379"></A><A HREF="#fn_1349"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> with the assistance of the righteous. 24. This, too, that his own is in the guardianship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1380"></A><A HREF="#fn_1350"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> of the sacred beings, whose vehemence is through Good Thought;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A></p>  
<p>even for this reason, because his bravery is for the law. 25. This, too, that life is given to mankind by him who shall do that which is able to remain good for them. 26. This, too, that the friendship of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is appropriated by him who has A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> as a guardian, and perpetual guardianship is appropriated by him who teaches to mankind that thing which becomes their perpetual guardianship <I>in</I> yonder <I>world</I>.</p>  
<p>27. This, too, that he causes righteousness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1381"></A><A HREF="#fn_1351"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who thinks of anything which is virtuous. 28. This, too, that he has caused the good commands and propitiousness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1382"></A><A HREF="#fn_1352"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, who gives <I>his</I> body and life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1383"></A><A HREF="#fn_1353"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to the sacred beings; and body <I>and</I> life are given to the sacred beings by him who affords friendship to the religion of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t. 29. And this, too, that to him who affords friendship to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> it occurs owing to the guardianship of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; and that guardianship is perpetually&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1384"></A><A HREF="#fn_1354"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> connected with him who teaches to others that thing which always constitutes their companionship with the sacred beings.</p>  
<p>30. Excellence <I>that</I> is perfect <I>is</I> righteousness.</p>
