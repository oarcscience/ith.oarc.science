<p>1. <I>In</I> the twentieth fargar<I>d</I>, Voh&ucirc;-khshathrem&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1506"></A><A HREF="#fn_1467"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <I>it is</I> also stated by A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;m&acirc;n thus: 'They who are now in sovereignty are privileged, the human being who is a wicked lying tyrant <I>being</I> not now in sovereignty; moreover, thou shouldst cause <I>some one</I> to thoroughly smite (ba<I>r</I>&acirc; v&acirc;n&icirc;n-<I>a</I><I>&ecirc;</I>) him who is causing deception in the embodied world by lamentation (<I>s</I>&icirc;van), and they cause the preservation of death, ruin, and falsehood because they would cause the preservation of his effects (mamana<I>s</I> var ae b&ocirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;n&ecirc;nd).' 2. And this, too, namely: 'When the sovereignty should be given by them unto him who is good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1507"></A><A HREF="#fn_1468"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>they</I> would be preserved through that sovereignty of his; moreover, thou shouldst cause <I>some one</I> to thoroughly smite him who is made deceitful by lamentation, and <I>so also</I> death, ruin, and falsehood.'</p>  
<p>3. This, too, that by him who shall provide complete mindfulness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1508"></A><A HREF="#fn_1469"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> for his own, righteousness is produced; even for this reason, because, through</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_380"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 380</FONT></A></p>  
<p>complete mindfulness, the discerning eye of life, which is righteousness, is enlightened. 4. This, too, that the coveted <I>thing</I> (&icirc;<I>s</I>t&#335;) which it is expedient for sovereignty to give away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1509"></A><A HREF="#fn_1470"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is taught by him who shall provide sovereignty for him who is all-progressive (ham&acirc;k-r&ucirc;bi<I>s</I>n&#335;); even for this reason, because the observation, consideration, and action of him who is an all-progressive ruler are about that which is coveted <I>by</I> the multitude and is an advantage for the sovereignty which it is expedient to produce.</p>  
<p>5. This, too, that <I>what is</I> produced by the words of Voh&ucirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1510"></A><A HREF="#fn_1471"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is taught by him who shall perform the ceremonial of the sacred beings with the thoughts of Voh&ucirc;man; even for this reason, because, the mind <I>being</I> with the thoughts of Voh&ucirc;man, the tongues of the faithful are habituated (kh&ucirc;k&icirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>ak&#335;) in the statements of Voh&ucirc;man. 6. This, too, that innocence from discontinued (am&acirc;nd) good works is taught by him who remains in virtue; even for this reason, because <I>they are</I> atoned for by him even among important good works.</p>  
<p>7. This, too, that the original causer of goodness is assisted in causing goodness by him whose fundamental gift (b&ucirc;n dahi<I>s</I>n&#335;) among the existences is that he supplies that which it is requisite for him to give; even for this reason, because <I>in</I> a work, upon which one remains with a thousand men, when one <I>man</I> is bringing his own strength to the labour therein, the 999 <I>other</I> men are assisted by him in that work.</p>  
<p>8. This, too, that the way of righteousness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1511"></A><A HREF="#fn_1472"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_381"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 381</FONT></A></p>  
<p>not concealed, <I>but</I> taught, by him who is a good considerer as to righteousness; even for this reason, because the sap and root of his righteousness are owing to undiverted thought. 9. This, too, that its <I>being</I> unnecessary to provide repletion for those who are cattle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1512"></A><A HREF="#fn_1473"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is taught by him who keeps cattle as a controller <I>for</I> benefiters; even for this reason, because they teach and command him.</p>  
<p>10. This, too, that housewifery&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1513"></A><A HREF="#fn_1474"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>being</I> performed is taught by that wife who shall joyfully pay reverence <I>to her</I> husband; even for this reason, because her housewifery is for the satisfaction of the husband, the satisfaction is through her reverence, and the reverence arises through joy. 11. This, too, that to love the religion through knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1514"></A><A HREF="#fn_1475"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is taught by him who is peaceful (pa<I>d</I>m&acirc;n&icirc;k) <I>and</I> Voh&ucirc;manic <I>to</I> it; even for this reason, because Voh&ucirc;manic peacefulness is understood as religion. 12. And this, too, that the gratification of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1515"></A><A HREF="#fn_1476"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is caused by him who teaches for A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>.</p>  
<p>13. It is righteousness <I>that is</I> perfect excellence.</p>
