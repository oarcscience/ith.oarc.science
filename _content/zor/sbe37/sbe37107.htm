<p>1. The twelfth fargar<I>d</I>, U<I>s</I>tavaiti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1385"></A><A HREF="#fn_1355"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, is <I>that</I> the benefit of him who is reverent <I>to</I> the benefiters is the benefit of any one whatever&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1386"></A><A HREF="#fn_1356"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>; even for this</p>

<p>reason, because the benefit of the immature creation is owing to carrying <I>out</I> the commands of a benefiting spiritual lord. 2. This, too, that whoever pleases superiors by submission, is pleased by inferiors. 3. This, too, that by him who gives thought to the religion of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, that which is best for his own in every mode&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1387"></A><A HREF="#fn_1357"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is produced, because he has attained to the religion who is listening best. 4. This, too, that virtue is taught by him to all the creatures of the beneficent spirit, <I>to</I> the righteous whose stepping forth (frav&acirc;mi<I>s</I>n&#335;) is for the righteous; even for this reason, because the creatures of the beneficent spirit are all <I>of</I> one nature, <I>and</I> the stepping forth (frag&acirc;mi<I>s</I>n&#335;) and hastening of the limbs of one body become those of the whole of that body. 5. This, too, that his spirit is connected with A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1388"></A><A HREF="#fn_1358"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and his knowledge is accepted, who loves Voh&ucirc;man; even for this reason, because the spirit <I>who</I> is the original spiritual lord of knowledge is Voh&ucirc;man. 6. This, too, that just giving is taught by him whose words are through Voh&ucirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1389"></A><A HREF="#fn_1359"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; even for this reason, because the speaking of virtuous words becomes the teaching of knowledge in which <I>there</I> is also just giving.</p>  
<p>7. This, too, that joy which is of long duration is produced&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1390"></A><A HREF="#fn_1360"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> for his own by him who brings forth strength through virtue, <I>and</I> who also assists him who is unborn; even for this reason, because joy which is perpetual increases by both. 8. This, too, that by him who is an assistance of those in the proper way, the proper way is taught to mankind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1391"></A><A HREF="#fn_1361"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>;</p>

<p><A NAME="page_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A></p>  
<p>even for this reason, because <I>he is</I> making mankind long for <I>that</I> way. 9. This, too, that heat is given to fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1392"></A><A HREF="#fn_1362"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> by him who <I>tells</I> truth to the invokers; even for this reason, because the adversary&#151;owing to the heat of the fire achieved <I>by</I> the indicator of truth&#151;is more particularly subdued by the strength of that just <I>one</I>.</p>  
<p>10. This, too, that the assistants for the renovation <I>of the universe</I> are the decrees of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp which&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1393"></A><A HREF="#fn_1363"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are through Voh&ucirc;man&#151;of S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1394"></A><A HREF="#fn_1364"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and Kai-Kh&ucirc;sr&ocirc;&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1395"></A><A HREF="#fn_1365"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; even for this reason, because the fragments are possessing a renewer which is their own completion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1396"></A><A HREF="#fn_1366"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and the completion&#151;which is through the assistance of the renovation by Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp&#151;is through what <I>occurs</I> when the religion is set going by him, through which the renovation arises; and the triumph of the completion, which is through an ordinance by S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns, is through what <I>occurs</I> when through the ordinance <I>there</I> is thus a decree which sets aside all distress from the creatures, <I>and</I> gives the ordinance <I>to</I> the whole material existence, that which is living and also that which is dead. 11. This, too, that whoever intrusts it with a command given&#151;which command given intrusts him who supplies the command from revelation&#151;and it worships what is</p>

<p><A NAME="page_356"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 356</FONT></A></p>  
<p>necessary to worship, is thereby displayed among the existences <I>as</I> the progeny of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1397"></A><A HREF="#fn_1367"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>12. This, too, that the defeat of the bad and the acceptance of the good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1398"></A><A HREF="#fn_1368"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are taught by him who shall provide a righteous gift for the worthy; because both are therein. 13. This, too, that ability for even the transformation of the creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1399"></A><A HREF="#fn_1369"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is taught by him who loves Voh&ucirc;man; even for this reason, because the forward-dragging, and also the backward-dragging, power&#151;which is in mankind&#151;is qualified, through changeableness of will, for even the actions of the Voh&ucirc;manic nature. 14. This, too, that power is taught, to that spirit through whom the creatures are changed, by him whose wisdom is for that which is wisdom; even for this reason, because that spirit is wisdom, <I>and</I> increases in mankind through instruction. 15. This, too, that by him who praises the religion like a disciple, and who also teaches <I>it</I> like a priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1400"></A><A HREF="#fn_1370"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, it is shown <I>that</I> S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1401"></A><A HREF="#fn_1370"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> really comes; even for this reason, because the religion, from the first praiser and teacher <I>down</I> to the last praiser and teacher, is connected by discipleship and priesthood, <I>and</I> S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns becomes a disciple <I>in</I> the end, and the last priest.</p>  
<p>16. This, too, that the wisdom of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1402"></A><A HREF="#fn_1371"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is taught by him who shall supply decisions and adjudication from the religion; even for this reason, because the decision of religion is the wisdom of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>. 17. This, too, that complete mindfulness, so that they are not deceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1403"></A><A HREF="#fn_1371"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, is taught</p>

<p><A NAME="page_357"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 357</FONT></A></p>  
<p>through wisdom by him who is as reverent <I>to</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> as a daughter <I>to</I> a father; even for this reason, because the reverence of a daughter unto a father arises mostly through natural sympathy (&acirc;hang-&icirc; <I>k</I>itr&icirc;k), <I>and</I> through the intellectual complete mindfulness of the daughter.</p>  
<p>18. This, too, that maintaining the destinies (vakht&acirc;n) of the body through the command of the creator is taught by him who teaches the righteous <I>man</I> and the wicked <I>one</I> that thing <I>which</I> becomes comfort to them, <I>to</I> the righteous <I>man</I> as to <I>his</I> body, <I>and to</I> the wicked <I>one</I> as to <I>his</I> soul; even for this reason, because he becomes a friend of the creatures, a friend of the creatures is also a friend of creativeness, <I>and</I> a friend of the creator maintains body <I>and</I> wealth through the command of the creator, <I>and</I> others are taught by him. 19. This, too, that joy owing to him who is powerful is taught him who is righteous only by him&#151;that is, <I>he</I> is conveying him to the rulers for benefit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1404"></A><A HREF="#fn_1372"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#151;who is an assistance of him who is righteous through capability, that is, he shall do it through exertion of power; even for this reason, because, when he <I>has</I> provided as much assistance as <I>it</I> is possible for him <I>to do</I>, his praise arises through that benefit which is pre-eminent through his exertion. 20. This, too, that the benefit <I>of</I> sovereignty for that which arises&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1405"></A><A HREF="#fn_1373"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is taught only by him who always thoroughly teaches authority (pat&icirc;h) up to dictatorship (visp&ocirc;-farm&acirc;n&icirc;h); that is, he teaches to others that thing which always arises for them up to dictatorial. authority; this is where it is connected by them with the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_358"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 358</FONT></A></p>  
<p>renovation <I>of the universe</I> through the control which is in the tree of germs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1406"></A><A HREF="#fn_1374"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>21. This, too, that he becomes liberal to fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1407"></A><A HREF="#fn_1375"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who shall perform work for fire that is its protection, and so it is taught about <I>it</I> through the obeisance by him whose liberality&#151;that is his through the obeisance&#151;becomes liberal, <I>and</I> whose declaration, that arises as to Voh&ucirc;man, possesses wealth through virtue. 22. This, too, <I>that</I> this thinking as to righteousness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1408"></A><A HREF="#fn_1376"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is taught only by him&#151;that is, he thinks&#151;whose petition for righteousness is ever afresh. 23. This, too, that the religion is interrogated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1409"></A><A HREF="#fn_1377"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> by him who is submissive <I>to</I> superiors and similarly situated (ham-<I>g</I>&acirc;k) <I>to</I> inferiors.</p>  
<p>24. This, too, that the state of the present <I>world</I> (latamman&icirc;h) for the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshipping religion is thoroughly taught where whatever becomes a progress&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1410"></A><A HREF="#fn_1378"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of the religion is whatever is purification for mankind; even for this reason, because the want of progress of the religion is owing to the want of purification of mankind as to the fiend, and when a human being is purified from the fiend, the progress of the religion becomes different. 25. This, too, that pleasure is taught to him who is a friend&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1411"></A><A HREF="#fn_1379"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>;</p>

<p>only by him&#151;that is, he gives it&#151;who is a pleasure to him who is a friend; and its routine is really this, that by him who causes pleasure to friends, his <I>having</I> caused pleasure is taught also to them. 26. This, too, that, owing to him whom A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> teaches joy, it is taught <I>that</I> gratification&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1412"></A><A HREF="#fn_1380"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> comes from A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; even for this reason, because he is exalted, even in the worldly <I>existence</I>, through that joy which is supreme, and mankind are thereby taught.</p>  
<p>27. This, too, that the augmentation of indications as to intellect is taught to him who is a vigorous-minded (t&ucirc;st&#335;-m&icirc;ni<I>s</I>n&#335;) man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1413"></A><A HREF="#fn_1381"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, by him whose own progress is that towards his own sacred beings; even for this reason, because he fully considers, <I>and</I> delivers the decision, of his own powers, of those, too, of <I>his</I> contemporaries (ham-bu<I>d</I>&icirc;k&acirc;n&#335;), <I>and</I> likewise of the chivalry (<I>k</I>&icirc;r&icirc;h) of the age; and others are taught about <I>it</I> by him. 28. This, too, that the spirit of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1414"></A><A HREF="#fn_1382"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is expounded only by him&#151;that is, he loves <I>it</I>&#151;whose close exposition is of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; even for this reason, because he becomes similarly loved with A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, so that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1415"></A><A HREF="#fn_1383"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> . . . 29. And this, too, that the reward is taught in the publicity of the sun&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1416"></A><A HREF="#fn_1384"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> by him whose friendship is for the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;m&acirc;n, which also increases in the day&#151;that is, it is necessary to perform duty and good works in the day&#151;but he does not put <I>it</I> aside the second day; even for this reason, because friendship for the religion is through kind regard;</p>

<p>and duty in <I>one</I> day, only to put <I>it</I> aside for the second day, becomes affliction (v&ecirc;sh) <I>at</I> the bridge <I>of judgment</I>; also the sun is the most kindly-regarding and swiftest of those visible.</p>
