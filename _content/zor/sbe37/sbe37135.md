### VI. PÂ*G*AG NASK <span id="fr_1795"></span>[2](#fn_1746).

Dk. VIII, Chap. VII, 4, or 5, probably refers to the passage which
contained the statement thus quoted in Sls. IX, 9, 10:—'In a passage of
the fifth fargar*d* of the Pâ*g*ôn it is declared that *one* mentions
these characteristics of four kinds of worship of the sacred beings:—one
is that whose Avesta is correct, *but* the man is bad; the second is
that whose Avesta is faulty, *but* the man is good; the third is that
whose Avesta is correct, *and* the man is good; *and* the fourth is that
whose Avesta is faulty, *and* the man is bad. *That* whose Avesta is
correct, *but* the man bad, the archangels will approach and will listen
to,

<span id="page_467">p. 467</span>

*but* do not accept; *that* whose Avesta is faulty, *but* the man good,
the archangels *and* sacred being will approach, *but* do not listen to,
*and* will accept; *that* whose Avesta is correct, *and* the man good,
the archangels *and* sacred being will approach, will come to, will
listen to, and will accept; *and that* whose Avesta is faulty, *and* the
man bad, they do not approach, do not listen to, and do not accept.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1745"></span>[466:1](sbe37134.htm#fr_1794) As there is no
account of this Nask in Dk. VIII, we can only guess that its extent was
about the average length of the other Hadha-mãthric Nasks, or about
6,800 words of Avesta text and 22,200 of Pahlavi version.

<span id="fn_1746"></span>[466:2](sbe37135.htm#fr_1795) The account of
this Nask in Dk. VIII (like those of Nasks VIII, XII, XIII, XX), though
four or five times as long as the very short accounts, is still short,
and the data for estimating the original extent of these five Nasks are
very inadequate. We may, perhaps, guess that the two Nasks VI, VIII were
together equal to half the length of the four other Hadha-mãthric Nasks
IV, VII, IX, X, and then proceed to apportion the extent, thus guessed,
between the two in proportion to the number of Pahlavi words in the
short account of each. In this way we shall find that the 505 Pahlavi
words in the short account of the Pâ*g*ag may indicate about 9,100 words
of Avesta text and 29,800 of Pahlavi version.
