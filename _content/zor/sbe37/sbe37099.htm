<p align="center"><I>Bak&#335; Nask</I>.</p>  
<p>1. Propitiation <I>for</I> the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, and a scornful dole <I>for</I> the evil spirit.</p>  
<p>2. The fourth fargar<I>d</I> is the Y&acirc;n&icirc;m-man&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1238"></A><A HREF="#fn_1224"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the Bak&#335;, about the praise of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, that is, his jurisdiction, invocation of blessing (y&acirc;n&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1239"></A><A HREF="#fn_1225"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and speaking <I>in</I> reply were such as are declared by the <I>sacred</I> text. 3. This, too, that that jurisdiction of his arose before the blessing, that is, this one decision is made by him about his own, that his own person is first made deserving by him through virtue, and then virtue is prayed for by him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1240"></A><A HREF="#fn_1226"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>4. This, too, that he has attributed the source <I>and</I> result to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, who gives joy to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; for the source and result of various advantages <I>and</I> various joys are desirable for joy itself, as joy is the acme (r&ocirc;&ecirc;<I>s</I>man) of every happiness <I>of him</I> whose joy <I>has</I> made an offering (a&ucirc;st&ocirc;fr&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, because his decision is this, that by him whose joy arises from that thing which is the will of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, its source <I>and</I> result are attributed to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>. 5. This, too, that the good work, which is a gratification <I>by</I> lawful gratifiers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1241"></A><A HREF="#fn_1227"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, becomes appropriated by him who shall perform that which is truly reverent; even for this reason, because he who is a lawful gratifier of others, through true reverence, <I>has</I> intended to gratify through the practice of his reverence, and, when thus the gratifier of those persons, the good work of gratification</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_312"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 312</FONT></A></p>  
<p><I>by</I> lawful gratifiers becomes appropriated. 6. This, too, that the wisdom of Voh&ucirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1242"></A><A HREF="#fn_1228"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is advanced by him who utters a discourse through Voh&ucirc;man; for this reason, because the wisdom of Voh&ucirc;man and its advancement are mostly through discourse. 7. This, too, that the plentifulness and satisfaction of cattle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1243"></A><A HREF="#fn_1228"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are taught by him who properly maintains the cattle which are in his possession; even for this reason, owing to the multitudes thus <I>belonging</I> to <I>him</I> who properly maintains the cattle which are in his possession, he gains his profit <I>and</I> pleasure therefrom, <I>and</I> others, who see that gain, are instructed, even as much as he, about the proper maintenance of cattle for their own profit <I>and</I> pleasure.</p>  
<p>8. This, too, that benefit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1244"></A><A HREF="#fn_1229"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>being</I> given for the benefit <I>of</I> the worthy <I>man</I> is taught by him who keeps the benefit that is his as the property <I>of</I> the sacred beings; even for this reason, because he gives the benefit that is his unto the worthy <I>man</I> for the purpose of keeping <I>it</I> for the advantage of the sacred beings, and others are instructed about it. 9. This, too, that prosperity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1245"></A><A HREF="#fn_1230"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> <I>being</I> given, in both existences&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1246"></A><A HREF="#fn_1229"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, to him who is generous <I>and</I> worthy is taught by him who gives benefit to a worthy <I>man</I> possessing body and life; even for this reason, because a worldly <I>existence</I> and a spiritual <I>one</I> are both his, also his worldly <I>existence</I> is in this existence, <I>and</I> the spiritual <I>one</I> in that existence wherefrom satisfaction <I>for</I> the giving of benefit arrives. 10. This, too, that by him who shall cause reverence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1247"></A><A HREF="#fn_1231"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of the good, even this is taught, that the sacred</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_313"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 313</FONT></A></p>  
<p>beings gratify him who is practising their will; even for this reason, because good for him, by whom the reverence is practised, becomes the reply of satisfaction, <I>and</I> the throne of the sacred beings is certain.</p>  
<p>11. This, too, that <I>he</I> who <I>was</I> at first has taught even this to mankind, that supplicants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1248"></A><A HREF="#fn_1232"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <I>for</I> the favour of the sacred beings gratify the sacred beings by being contented (pa<I>d</I>v<I>&acirc;</I><I>z</I>); even for this reason, because the welcome of a sacred being, supplied by command from the religion, is a virtuousness in the world distinct from that, and the production of a course of generosity, from the sacred beings to mankind, arises really through the contentment of the favoured; <I>and</I> mankind thereby become freer from doubt, and believe more in the sacred beings. 12. This, too, that his soul is delivered, <I>or will</I> be delivered, into the supreme heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1249"></A><A HREF="#fn_1233"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, who <I>has</I> given something to him who praises the sacred beings <I>and</I> the good; even for this reason, because even through liberality as to wealth, and the production of a way to the supreme heaven, <I>it</I> is manifest <I>that</I> anything given to the praisers of the sacred beings <I>and</I> the good is a greater liberality. 13. This, too, that the reverence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1250"></A><A HREF="#fn_1234"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of those needing reverence is occasioned by him who teaches the <I>sacred</I> word (v<I>&acirc;</I><I>k</I>ak&#335;) to the good; even for this reason, because he who is a good teacher of revelation (d&ecirc;n&ocirc;) can bring <I>it</I> into use for the reverence, advantage, <I>and</I> joy of the sacred beings <I>and</I> the good.</p>  
<p>14. This, too, that acquaintance with the religion of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1251"></A><A HREF="#fn_1234"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is disclosed to his own by him who loves Voh&ucirc;man; even for this reason, because true</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_314"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 314</FONT></A></p>  
<p>knowledge arises from the discrimination of pure wisdom, and the pure attainment of the most discriminative spiritual lord (ahv&ocirc;) to the mind, through the purity that constitutes the way within the mind of a spiritual lord, the purity which becomes that way through the lodgment of Voh&ucirc;man there. 15. This, too, that righteousness is taught&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1252"></A><A HREF="#fn_1235"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <I>by him</I> who keeps <I>his</I> mind connected with righteousness; even for this reason, because his mind attains to an effort for authority, and, ridden by the effort, <I>attains</I> to <I>its</I> acquisition. 16. This, too, that by him who gives commands about the progress of the concerns of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, this is also taught to mankind, namely, when <I>one</I> sees the throne of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1253"></A><A HREF="#fn_1236"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; even for this reason, because it is possible to see that throne through the complete progress <I>of</I> the will of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> in the world; <I>and</I> whoever gives commands about the progress of the concerns of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, the will of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is necessary in him, the progressive share of those concerns for the people of the world <I>being</I> shown, which is seen even through that foundation, of completeness that becomes the throne of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> <I>for</I> mankind.</p>  
<p>i7. This, too, that by him who welcomes A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> in <I>him</I>self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1254"></A><A HREF="#fn_1237"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, matters only known by even a high-priest are then taught to mankind; even for this reason, because instruction and knowledge are mostly those through a high-priest, and by him who welcomes A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> in <I>him</I>self, a spiritual lord is then prayed for, who becomes glorious and praised for that which is to be taught, and mankind are taught by him. 18. This, too, that by any one good, who</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_315"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 315</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is a servant <I>and</I> pleaser of a good ruler, a good person may be brought forward, to him who is the ruler, for benefit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1255"></A><A HREF="#fn_1238"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; even for this reason, because a good <I>man</I> associates other good people with him in the benefit that happens to him, and <I>his</I> character, temper, <I>and</I> disposition are thus due to that; but when bringing himself forward to rulers, through reverence <I>and</I> gratification <I>of</I> the rulers, other good people may also be brought forward by him for that benefit. 19. This, too, that by him <I>who</I> shall virtuously make an accumulation, the way of prosperity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1256"></A><A HREF="#fn_1239"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> from the sacred beings is disclosed to his own; even for this reason, because virtuous accumulation is provided through unnumbered (<I>a</I>p&ecirc;nav&acirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) grants of a decider, and, when <I>it is</I> so, he becomes the treasurer of the sacred beings.</p>  
<p>20. This, too, that by him who produces advantage for the archangels, the gift of him who is suitable for the sovereignty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1257"></A><A HREF="#fn_1240"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of the immature (kh&acirc;m) world is solicited; even for this reason, because the advantage which is produced for the archangels <I>being</I> for the sake of his own, the advantage of the immature creation solicited&#151;the supreme advantage of the primitive good creations&#151;becomes a virtuous ruler. 21. This, too, that by him who is a praiser&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1258"></A><A HREF="#fn_1240"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of an archangel, the good religion is praised; even for this reason, because the good religion is praise of the archangels, <I>and</I> the praise of the archangels is the good religion. 22. This, too, that the religion of the sacred beings is made progressive&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1259"></A><A HREF="#fn_1240"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> by him who shall make an offering (a&ucirc;st&ocirc;fr&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) <I>to</I> the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_316"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 316</FONT></A></p>  
<p>sacred beings; even for this reason, because making an offering <I>to</I> the sacred beings strengthens the upholders of religion, and the progress of religion occurs through upholders of religion.</p>  
<p>23. This, too, that by him who shall make mankind quite zealous (garem&ocirc;k&#335;) for doing good works, the reward of the good works is also made liberal for mankind; even for this reason, because the producer of the origin is also the producer of the result. 24. This, too, that above the multitude is the praise of the man who is assisting those of virtuous will, who is also the nourishment of the creatures through virtuousness, and whose accumulation is also owing to virtuousness; even for this reason, because whoever is assisting those of virtuous will is an increaser of virtuousness in the world, whoever is the nourishment of the creatures through virtuousness is a producer of the paternity of creatures, <I>and he</I> whose accumulation is owing to virtuousness becomes an improver of the world. 25. This, too, that by him who assists him who is ignorant (kha<I>s</I>t), is given <I>and</I> taught to supplicants that which is suitable for them. 26. To assist him who is ignorant is this, such as forming the province, district, domain, <I>and</I> family; maintaining the abode <I>and</I> house of a follower of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp (Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;s<I>p</I>an&#335;), the fortress <I>and</I> stronghold, and the homestead (kh&acirc;n) of the agricultural peasant; repairing a rugged road; building bridges over rivers; managing a river, aqueduct, or brook; populating desolate places; <I>and</I> doing other things, owing to which any retention (g&icirc;rift-a&ecirc;) of the comfort and advantage of mankind in the world occurs. 27. And by him who shall do these things, the assistance even of him who is born afterwards,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_317"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 317</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the making of that which is a very advantageous thing suitable <I>for</I> mankind, and also the doing <I>of this</I> for others, are taught.</p>  
<p>28. This, too, that it is revealed (<I>k</I>&acirc;sht&ocirc;) of the spiritual existence <I>that</I> that which is wisdom is for A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, for him who is wisdom&#151;that is, it teaches <I>that</I> acquired <I>wisdom</I> is for him whose innate wisdom is good&#151;even for this reason, because the spirit, this that has come into his possession, which is acquired wisdom, is given by it to the progeny of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, which is innate wisdom, to increase <I>it; and</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is gratified thereby.</p>  
<p>29. Of a summary about the continuance <I>that</I> was, the progress of the material <I>existence, and</I> the continuance <I>that will</I> be&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1260"></A><A HREF="#fn_1241"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <I>there</I> is also this:&#151;about the continuance <I>that</I> was, which is the beginning, <I>there are</I> the essential thought <I>and</I> beneficent production of the good and evil material <I>existence</I> of its good goodness, and that of <I>its</I> evil vileness; about the progress of the material <I>existence</I>, which is intermediate, <I>there are</I> the dutiful doing of good works, righteousness, and having reward, the committal of crime, wickedness, <I>and</I> having the bridge <I>penalty; and</I> about the continuance <I>that will</I> be, which is the last, <I>there are</I> the government, with wisdom, of that supremely good <I>one</I> who is the origin of all the multitudinous <I>creatures</I> (vas&icirc;k&acirc;n), the triumph of goodness over vileness, the admissibility <I>of</I> the good, the inadmissibility of the bad, <I>and</I> the purity of the restoration of the good creatures.</p>  
<p>30. Of righteousness perfect is the excellence.</p>
