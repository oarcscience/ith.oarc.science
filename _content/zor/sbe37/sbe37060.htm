<p>1. The tenth fargar<I>d</I>, Y&acirc;-<I>s</I><I>h</I>yaothan&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_550"></A><A HREF="#fn_546"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is about the complaint of the spirit of fires to A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> owing to seven descriptions of people. 2. First, owing to domestics considering <I>it</I> as contemptible and <I>in</I> an unresisting state (a<I>g</I>ang&icirc;h), molesting <I>it</I> immoderately, and making use of it with unwashed hands; also the damsel who <I>has</I> introduced fire into the sole of <I>her</I> foot, and the bursting of the blister (&acirc;vilag); and a weapon brought out into <I>its</I> splendour. Second, the complaint owing to the carriers of fire from that abode [where the provision of care for fire is as a law to them, to that abode]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_551"></A><A HREF="#fn_547"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> where the provision of care for fire is not as a law to them. 4. And there, owing to the arrival and preparation of the demons, it lay stupefied, like a powerful youth <I>who is</I> feverish and in a languid state; and its cure from that sickness (ay&ocirc;yak&icirc;h) was by bringing forward to it their pure sandalwood, or benzoin, or aloe-wood, or pomegranate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_548"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, or</p>  
<p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A></p>  
<p>whatever <I>there</I> was of the most odoriferous of plants. 5. Third, the complaint owing to the hussy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_549"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> unto whom it happens, through menstruation, <I>that</I> the stench and filth owing to the menstruation is brought to it (<I>the fire</I>); and <I>its</I> sickness and stupefaction owing thereto are as written above. 6. Fourth, the complaint owing to the hussy who, dropping <I>her</I> knee on to the fire-stand, arranged <I>her</I> curls; the falling of damp and moisture from <I>her</I> head, with the hair and filth therefrom, into the fire; the consumption <I>of it</I> discontentedly, <I>and</I> the sickness and stupefaction owing thereto. 7. Fifth, the complaint owing to the father, <I>or</I> guardian, of a child for not keeping the child away from the fire; and the bodily refuse and other unlawfulness that come upon it from such children. 8. Sixth, the complaint owing to the adversity which the unpurified infidel (agd&ecirc;n&ocirc;) may bring upon it, by blowing the breath of <I>his</I> mouth upon it in directing <I>its</I> use, <I>and</I> it becomes incalculable. 9. Seventh, the complaint&#151;which, <I>one</I> says, is more awful and more grievous&#151;owing to those who use it as an ordeal for a falsehood, and, when it is made evident thereby as to the acquitted and convicted, they become of a different opinion about it.</p>  
<p>10. At the place of complaint that which is polluted is put forward together with that which is pure, and the increase of it (<I>the fire</I>) is through lawful and unlawful operation; <I>its</I> burning alone</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_188"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 188</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and increasing are such as when both would be as a necessity for it, and undesired and rapid burning and increasing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are those which are polluted by burning <I>and</I> insatiably consuming; and in that which is an operation unlawfully&#151;the burning alone <I>and</I> increasing <I>being</I> [such as when]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_551"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> both would be as a necessity [for it]&#151;the increase is troubled.</p>  
<p>11. This, too, he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> says: 'I am not <I>of the world</I> here, and from here I <I>will</I> extricate <I>myself</I>, from the earth up to the sky; I am also thy son&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_557"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, more to thee&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_558"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> than any of the other creatures.' 12. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke to him thus: 'So thou shouldst stand over the fire, in thy proper duty as [a spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_559"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>], carrying that club; [it is a substantial means, because I produce it, through which] thou turnest off [the whole bodily existence], some to the endless light, and some to the endless darkness.'</p>  
<p>13. This, too, that <I>he</I> who shall provide care for, fire has paid the greatest reverence unto A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>. 14. The propitiation of the righteous is the best <I>thing</I>, and their vexation is the worst; when pleased they favour one, <I>and it is</I> the law of the sacred beings that they promote; [when vexed they wound, <I>and it</I> is the demon that they restrict.</p>  
<p>15. It is righteousness <I>that is</I> perfect excellence.]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>

XXXIV, 1), here written y&acirc;-shy&acirc;&ocirc;sn&#335; in Pahlavi in both MSS. This fargar<I>d</I> may perhaps be considered as a homily upon Yas. XXXIV, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_547"></A><A HREF="sbe37060.htm#fr_551">186:2</A> The words in brackets are omitted in B by mistake.</P>

VIII, 2, 79, IX, 32, XIV, 3, <A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A> XVIII, 71 as acceptable fuel for the sacred fire, or scent for fumigation; their Pahlavi names are merely corruptions of these Avesta words.</P>
