### CHAPTER LIX.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The thirteenth fargar*d*, Ta*d*-thwâ-peresâ <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[1](#fn_1385), is *that* the obeisance <span
id="fr_1418"></span>[2](#fn_1386) of the archangels is performed by him
who is educated in the recitation *for* the archangels of *one* learned
in the religion, which is when *he has* to understand the recitation and
to maintain the recitation of revelation with propriety, which is when
an enumeration, or form (âînakŏ), as to the qualities of the archangels
exists, which is the obeisance *for* the sacred beings. 2. For, on this
subject, one mentions seven kinds *of men* <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[3](#fn_1387), educated, or well-educated, or
ill-educated, who are connected with it in statements by those of the
world; the merely educated *man*, particularly also the physician,
explains this which is not mentioned *and* does not occur, that *it is*
well, or ill, disposed <span id="fr_1420"></span>[4](#fn_1388); the
merely well-educated *man*, particularly also the physician, explains
this which is mentioned *and* occurs, that *it is* well-disposed; the
merely ill-educated *man, and*

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

also the physician, explains this which is mentioned *and* occurs, that
*it is* ill-disposed; and the merely uneducated *man* explains anything
whatever that is really life <span id="fr_1421"></span>[1](#fn_1389). 3.
*One* educated in the recitation *for* the sacred beings, who when—on
account of the necessity of speaking evil about a learned man—*he* is
mischievous (anâg), so that he keeps in viciousness, *and has* remained
in the obeisance *for* the sacred beings, is called not ransomed (la
tâkhtîk). 4. *One* ill-educated in the recitation *for* the sacred
beings, which is when *it happens* that he keeps in viciousness, becomes
even an apostate who is acquainted with the religion. 5. *One*
uneducated in what *pertains to* the sacred beings is of two kinds,
either good <span id="fr_1422"></span>[2](#fn_1390) and void of
learning, or an evil *one* who is void of knowledge; the good *and* void
of learning worships the sacred beings unobservantly with the proper
rites, and the evil *one* who is void of knowledge thinks to worship the
sacred beings un-observantly with improper rites, and *has* no means of
trustworthy reliance upon the religion of the sacred beings and their
obeisance. 6. And *one* well-educated in what *pertains to* the sacred
beings, through the three words of the connected series
(ham-pa*d*vandi*s*nîh) which is good (khu) and learned <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[3](#fn_1391), and through what *pertains to* the
sacred beings, expounds faithfully the object of the obeisance *for* the
sacred beings.

7\. This, too, that, by him who teaches to mankind that thing which
becomes their hope of eternity, mankind are taught to come to the
religion of

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

the sacred beings; even for this reason, because the Vohûmanic
attainment <span id="fr_1424"></span>[1](#fn_1392) to the religion of
the sacred beings is to be required wisely for them, its requirement
wisely for them is a benefit for the steadfast and becomes a
consideration (mînîh) for them, and the consideration of the benefit of
the steadfast is through hope of the eternity which is provided for the
benefit, on account of which the hope of eternity—which is the basis—is
the reason even of the acceptance of the religion.

8\. This, too, that the perfection of the first among the
existences <span id="fr_1425"></span>[2](#fn_1393) is taught by him who
*has* retentively remembered his words; even for this reason, because
remembrance is the acme of every perfection. 9. This, too, that he
becomes a nourisher of good works who shall perform good works publicly;
even for this reason, because others are taught thereby, and good works
increase in the world. 10. This, too, that by him who has fruit in the
possession of Aûha*r*ma*zd* the development of the world in virtue <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[3](#fn_1394) is taught; even for this reason,
because a lawful preserver and a producer of liberality arise through
the fruit, they enlarge the root of the power of the angel *of*
liberality, and pluck *its* fruit; the world is improved thereby, *and*
mankind are taught about *it*. 11. This, too, that, through complete
mindfulness, words *and* actions <span id="fr_1427"></span>[4](#fn_1395)
are truly taught by him whose ceremonial is for complete mindfulness;
even for this reason, because there are both words *and* actions in the
ceremonial.

12\. This, too, that the sagacious creativeness (far’*z*ânak dahîh) of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* is taught, which is

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

the exposition, to Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[1](#fn_1396), of the production of the renovation;
even for this reason, because the advantage of the sagacity of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* is the consequence of its beginning, and *its* middle is
through the power of the goodness and knowledge of him himself, and
because *it is* destiny as regards the creations; and whoever possesses
that power for the assistance of the renovation, is extolled for that
sagacity, and *people* are taught thereby. 13. This, too, that the
reward of Zaratû*s*t is appropriated by him who decides about duty and
opinion <span id="fr_1429"></span>[2](#fn_1397); even for this reason,
because, through that discrimination, *he is* similar to Zaratû*s*t.

14\. This, too, that the recitation of revelation is performed *for*
mankind by him who extends the propagation of the religion <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[3](#fn_1398); even for this reason, because, owing
to the gratification of virtuous practisers, virtue increases. 15. This,
too, that the religion of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is made progressive <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[2](#fn_1397) by him who shall perform the
ceremonial of Aûha*r*ma*zd*; even for this reason, because through that
performance of his occurs the blessing of the provider of the rite
(nîrangînî*d*âr). 16. This, too, that that perfectly righteous *man* of
just judgment is protected from the annoying spirit <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[4](#fn_1399) by him who possesses the resemblance
(ângûnagîh) unto Vohûman that they behold and resources through virtue;
even for this reason, because the vexation which is partaken by him
(*the spirit*), owing to the just judgment among those of the nature
(*k*îharîkân) of mankind, is redoubled (dôkânî-aîtŏ) by their pleasure
owing to the Vohûmanic resemblance, *and* the annoying spirit

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

is disabled (akârî-hênd) <span id="fr_1433"></span>[1](#fn_1400) by that
accumulated vexation *which* occurs for his annoyance.

17\. This, too, that the exploits of the archangels are taught by him
who is really capable in what *pertains to* the archangels; even for
this reason, because they become the hope of a consoling (vê*d*var) end,
and are also indicative of the renovation *of the universe*, the hope of
a virtuous end. 18. This, too, that the words of him who is Zaratû*s*t,
that '*people* shall become supplicant,' are taught by him who is for
the benefiters; even for this reason, *because* they who are benefiters,
on account of an inclination for the religion, make others eager for the
religion, and make them mount for prayer. 19. And this, *too*, that by
him who gives anything to a righteous man, this is also done that some
one else *may* give even to him who is vile; even for this reason,
because a foundation of liberality is thereby prepared for him <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[2](#fn_1401).

20\. Perfect righteousness is excellence.
