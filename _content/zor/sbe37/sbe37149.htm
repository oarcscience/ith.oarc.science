<p>It has been already shown, in Dk. VIII, Chap. XLVI, 1 n, that the whole of this Nask is probably still extant in the Yasna and V&icirc;sp&ecirc;ra<I>d</I>. About half of the present Yasna appears to consist of five-sixths of this St&ocirc;<I>d</I>-yast, to which have been added three</p>

<p>fargar<I>d</I>s of the Bak&#335; (Nask III), with the H&ocirc;m and Sr&ocirc;sh Ya<I>s</I>ts, extracted probably from the Bak&acirc;n-ya<I>s</I>t (Nask XIV), and the greater part of the &Acirc;ta<I>s</I> and &Acirc;b&acirc;n Ny&acirc;yi<I>s</I>es; the whole collection being provided with an introductory and concluding ritual, compiled from other sources, to form the complete ceremonial liturgy of the present Yasna.</p>  
<p>There appears to be no sufficient evidence, either internal or external, for ascribing this collection of the liturgy to so late a date as the end of the ninth century, when the compilation of the Dinka<I>r</I><I>d</I> was completed. It is therefore safer, for the present, to assume that the St&ocirc;<I>d</I>-ya<I>s</I>t existed for a long period as a separate Nask (the form described by the Dinka<I>r</I><I>d</I>), even after the greater part of its text had been incorporated with others to form the collected liturgy now known as the Yasna.</p>  
<p align="center">_______________</p>  
<p>Besides the fragments which are specially attributed to particular Nasks, there are also a few writings which closely resemble the Nasks, or their fragments, in general character, but which can hardly be traced to their actual source by means of the accounts given in the Dinka<I>r</I><I>d</I>. Thus, the Aogemada&ecirc;<I>k</I>&acirc; might perhaps be supposed to have been extracted from the Bari<I>s</I> (see Dk. VIII, Chap. IX, 18), if it did not contain a few Avesta quotations from the Yasna, Vend&icirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I>, and Ya<I>s</I>ts. While the quotations from the Ashem-staota, given in Vi<I>g</I>. pp. 89, 90, 125-129, 177, 178, are difficult to trace, owing to the name of their source.</p>
