### CHAPTER LIV.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The eighth fargar*d*, *Hv*aêtumaiti <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[3](#fn_1302), is *that* by him who teaches wisdom
to others the not being deceived by an apostate into confusing a
righteous *one* (aharûbŏ-barî*s*îh) is also taught <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[4](#fn_1303); even for this reason, because he who
*has* taught is not deceived.

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

2\. This, too, that by him who is as reverent *unto* Aûha*r*ma*zd* as a
daughter *unto* a father, and who is also a gratifier of virtuous doers,
Spenda*r*ma*d* <span id="fr_1332"></span>[1](#fn_1304) is *made one* of
the archangels, and one is also made to love *her;* even for this
reason, because through that Spenda*r*ma*d*ic *one being* reverent
*unto* Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and the gratification of the good *by* him, the
archangels love and preserve her Spenda*r*ma*d*ic nature
(Spenda*r*ma*d*îgîh). 3. This, too, that he who is loving Vohûman is
taught by his wisdom not to destroy (nasânînî*d*a*n*ŏ) <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[2](#fn_1305) the religion of Aûha*r*ma*zd*; even
for this reason, because wisdom maintains the religion in virtue, and
others are taught about it.

4\. This, too, that by him who gives *him*self in discipleship unto the
priests, *and* who asks again that which he does not understand,
learning (âmûkŏ) is taught; even for this reason, because the asking for
knowledge again *by him* who *has* given *him*self in discipleship to a
wise priest, increases knowledge; and the friends of knowledge,
therefore, make him an example, and shall practise asking again, that
which they do not understand, *from* the disciples of the priests.

5\. This, too, that whoever is *in accordance* with Zaratû*s*t, through
pure affection, becomes, in like manner, *him* who is giving strength
*to* the will of the archangels and the commands *of* the good; even for
this reason, because these two capabilities *are* of the special nature
of Zaratû*s*t. 6. This, too, that through the discrimination of him who
loves <span id="fr_1334"></span>[3](#fn_1306) Vohûman Aûha*r*ma*zd*

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

is gratified; even for this reason, because *one* loving Vohûman is
loving wisdom and *has* taught wisdom, wisdom taught is discrimination,
and the discriminator becomes a gratifier of Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

7\. This, too, that whoever gives thought to the religion of Zaratû*s*t
is taught wisdom; even for this reason, because all the wisdom of the
good religion is taught to him by giving thought. 8. This, too, that
whoever *has* kept wealth in the control <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[1](#fn_1307) of Zaratû*s*t becomes taught, *and* is
*one* who is reverent *to* the benefiters; even for this reason, because
whoever is reverent *to* the supporters of religion keeps wealth in the
control *of* the supporters of religion, *and*, when kept by him in
their control, it is kept by him in that of Zaratû*s*t.

9\. This, too, that his destiny is connected with himself who practises
industry. 10. This, too, that his good works *for* arranging the
creation become his own who has fully prepared his own person.

11\. The excellence *of* righteousness is perfect.

possible to read the verbal stem gôsh 'hear,' <span id="page_342">p.
342</span> instead of dôsh (Av. zush); but this is hardly possible in §
2, and gôshî*d*anŏ is not the usual Pahlavi for 'to hear.'
