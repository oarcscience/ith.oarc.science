### CHAPTER XXVIII.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The fifth fargar*d*, Yânîm-manô <span
id="fr_775"></span>[1](#fn_770), is about the beneficence *and*
worthiness of Zaratû*s*t, through the virtuousness of his thoughts,
words, *and* deeds <span id="fr_776"></span>[2](#fn_771); the priority
of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_777"></span>[3](#fn_772), and the first
possession of obeisance (nîyâyisnŏ) to him; the mindful performance of
obeisance *to* the sacred beings, *and* all the merit *of* obeisance
*to* the sacred beings; the excellence of receiving a righteous man,
*of* bringing fire together, and *of* maintaining the good religion; the
elementary (khâm) wisdom <span id="fr_778"></span>[4](#fn_773) of the
creator, and the consideration of every duty towards his will and
creation; the outward indication as to propitious discrimination and *of
what* is done *by* those who are propitious; *and* the existence *of*
every kind of self-attraction *by* Zaratû*s*t towards the religion, from
first to last, through the complete reasoning thought that arose solely
through obeisance *to* the sacred beings.

2\. This, too, that 'thou art come to the supreme heaven
(garô*d*mân) <span id="fr_779"></span>[5](#fn_774), O righteous
Zaratû*s*t! thou

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

art aware of the deeds, O Zaratû*s*t! which *were* practised by those in
the bodily existence, *and* which still they practise, and the sacred
beings have placed upon mankind acquiring the power of good works.' 3.
And about the wonderfulness of the supreme heaven *there is* this, too,
that whoever is in that abode is not any one *that* passes away after
*his* birth; at the time of the renovation *of the universe* the supreme
heaven is lowered down to the star station <span
id="fr_780"></span>[1](#fn_775), the earth *being* up to there, and
Vohûman <span id="fr_781"></span>[2](#fn_776) is summoned for every
purpose to the conference, and, when they call him, Mit*r*ô's <span
id="fr_782"></span>[3](#fn_777) investigation as regards the existence
of righteousness is on the spot; through the coming of that
archangel <span id="fr_783"></span>[4](#fn_778) of true statements for
assistance, and through the co-operation of the *other* archangels and
Srôsh <span id="fr_784"></span>[2](#fn_776) the righteous, is the
overpowering of the vexing of distressers <span
id="fr_785"></span>[5](#fn_779); and the assistance of the archangels
for Zaratû*s*t was when he went forth for disabling the vicious law of
Irân. 4. Concerning Zaratû*s*t *there is* this, too, in the words of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, that is: 'Thou art our own, O Zaratû*s*t! and this
liberality *to* thee is ours; anything *one* gives to thee is given by
him *to* us;' also the announcement to Zaratû*s*t, *and* the bringing
*of him to* Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_786"></span>[6](#fn_780) for his
assistance and likewise the strength <span
id="fr_787"></span>[7](#fn_781) of his sovereignty for him.

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

5\. The discipleship and veneration of Frashô*s*tar <span
id="fr_788"></span>[1](#fn_782) also, and the laudation of Frashô*s*tar
for making the religion progressive and *for its* true transmission in
the words of Aûha*r*ma*zd*; also the whole righteousness of those whom
Frashô*s*tar attracted to the religion.

6\. About the laudation of Zaratû*s*t *there is* this, too, that is:
'*Thou art* not astray *from* us, neither in life, nor in enquiry, nor
*in* openly announcing, even when demonstrating <span
id="fr_789"></span>[2](#fn_783) the religion to others, nor in anything
whatever, *O* Spîtâmân! *from* us who are archangels; and the donation
of benefit to supplicants is the food, and the clothing for us, who are
in the ceremonial *of* the sacred beings, is unworn (asû*d*akŏ) <span
id="fr_790"></span>[3](#fn_784).'

7\. About guarding a friend, managing an unfriendly *person*, and
affording a person shelter for the sake of protection, justice, and
rectitude <span id="fr_791"></span>[4](#fn_785); also the unworthy
condition of that man who, requiring to perform those duties and good
works that are important, shall perform those that are trivial. 8. And
this, too, that is: 'Thou art likewise aware, *and* thou also
understandest it, *O* righteous Zaratû*s*t! through the sagacity of my
wisdom, which was the first among existences <span
id="fr_792"></span>[5](#fn_786), and which is also so unto the last
existence.'

9\. Righteousness is excellence *that is* perfect.
