### CHAPTER XXIX <span id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_632).

1\. On \[the *spiritual* chieftainship <span
id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_633) of the regions *of the earth*\] it says
in revelation, that every one of those six chieftainships <span
id="fr_639"></span>[3](#fn_634) has one *spiritual* chief; as the chief
of Arzah is Ashâshagaha*d*-ê *Hv*a*n*d*k*ãn <span
id="fr_640"></span>[4](#fn_635), the chief of Savah is
Hoazarôdathhri-hanâ Parê*s*tyarô <span id="fr_641"></span>[5](#fn_636),
the chief of Frada*d*afsh is Spîtôî*d*-i Aûspôsînân <span
id="fr_642"></span>[6](#fn_637), \[the chief of Vîda*d*afsh is
Aîrî*z*-râsp Aûspôsînân <span id="fr_643"></span>[7](#fn_638),\] the
chief of Vôrûbar*s*t is Huvâsp <span id="fr_644"></span>[8](#fn_639),
the chief of Vôrûgar*s*t is *K*akhravâk <span
id="fr_645"></span>[9](#fn_640). 2. Zaratû*s*t is

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

*spiritual* chief of the region of Khvanîras, and also of all the
regions; *he is* chief of the world of the righteous, *and* it is said
that the whole religion was received by them from Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_646"></span>[1](#fn_641).

3\. In the region of Khvanîras are many places, from which, in this evil
time of violent struggling with the adversary, a passage (vi*d*arg) is
constructed by the power of the spiritual world (maînôkîh), *and one*
calls *them* the beaten tracks <span id="fr_647"></span>[2](#fn_642) of
Khvanîras.

4\. Counterparts of those other regions <span
id="fr_648"></span>[3](#fn_643) are *such places* as Kangde*z*, the land
of S*a*ukavastân, the plain of the Arabs (Tâ*z*îkân), the plain of
Pê*s*yânsaî, the river Nâîvtâk <span id="fr_649"></span>[4](#fn_644),
Aîrân-vê*g*, the enclosure (var) formed by Yim, *and* Ka*s*mîr in
India <span id="fr_650"></span>[5](#fn_645). 5. And one immortal chief
acts in the government of *each*

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

*of* them; as it says, that Pêshyôtanû <span
id="fr_651"></span>[1](#fn_646) *son* of Vi*s*tâsp, whom they call
*K*îtrô-maînô <span id="fr_652"></span>[2](#fn_647), is in the country
of Kangde*z* <span id="fr_653"></span>[3](#fn_648); Aghrêra*d* <span
id="fr_654"></span>[4](#fn_649) *son* of Pashang is in the land of
S*a*ukavastân <span id="fr_655"></span>[5](#fn_650), and they call him
Gôpatshah <span id="fr_656"></span>[6](#fn_651); Par*s*adgâ <span
id="fr_657"></span>[7](#fn_652) *Hv*embya is in the plain of

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pêsyânsaî <span
id="fr_658"></span>[1](#fn_653), *and he* is *Hv*embya for this reason,
because they brought *him* up in a *hv*emb ('jar') for fear of Khashm
('Wrath'); \[Asâm-i <span id="fr_659"></span>[2](#fn_654) Yamâhu*s*t is
in the place which they call the River Nâîvtâk\]; the tree opposed to
harm <span id="fr_660"></span>[3](#fn_655) is in Aîrân-vê*g*;
Urvatad-nar <span id="fr_661"></span>[4](#fn_656) *son* of Zaratû*s*t is
in the enclosure formed by Yim. 6. Regarding them it says, they are
*those* who are immortal, as are Narsih <span
id="fr_662"></span>[5](#fn_657) *son* of Vîvanghâû, Tûs <span
id="fr_663"></span>[6](#fn_658) *son* of Nô*d*ar <span
id="fr_664"></span>[7](#fn_659), Gîw <span
id="fr_665"></span>[8](#fn_660) *son* of Gû*d*ar*z*, Ibairaz <span
id="fr_666"></span>[9](#fn_661) the causer of strife, *and* Ashavazd son
of Pourudhâkh*s*t <span id="fr_667"></span>[10](#fn_662); and they will
all <span id="fr_668"></span>[11](#fn_663) come forth, to the

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

assistance of Sôshyans, on the production of the renovation *of the
universe*.

7\. Regarding Sâm <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_664) it says, that he
became immortal, *but* owing to his disregard of the Mazdayasnian
religion, a Tûrk whom they call Nihâ*g* <span
id="fr_670"></span>[2](#fn_665) wounded *him* with an arrow, when he was
asleep there, in the plain of Pê*s*yânsaî; and it had brought upon him
the unnatural lethargy (bûshasp) *which* overcame *him in* the midst of
the heat <span id="fr_671"></span>[3](#fn_666). 8. And the glory (far)
of heaven stands over him <span id="fr_672"></span>[4](#fn_667) for the
purpose that, when A*z*-i Dahâk <span id="fr_673"></span>[5](#fn_668)
becomes unfettered (ara*z*ak), he may arise and slay him; and a myriad
guardian spirits of the righteous are as a protection to him. 9. Of
Dahâk, whom they call Bêvarâsp, this, too, it says, that Frê*d*ûn when
he captured Dahâk was not able to kill *him*, and afterwards confined
him in Mount Dimâvand <span id="fr_674"></span>[6](#fn_669); when he
becomes unfettered, Sâm arises, and smites and slays him.

10\. As to Kangde*z*, *it is* in the direction of the east, at many
leagues from the bed (var) <span id="fr_675"></span>[7](#fn_670) of the

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

wide-formed ocean towards that side. 11. The plain of Pê*s*yânsaî is in
Kâvulistân, as it says, that the most remarkable upland (bâlist) in
Kâvulistân is where Pê*s*yânsaî is; there it is hotter, on the more
lofty elevations there is no heat <span id="fr_676"></span>[1](#fn_671).
12. Aîrân-vê*g* is in the direction of Âtarô-pâtakân <span
id="fr_677"></span>[2](#fn_672). 13. The land of S*a*ukavastân is on the
way from Tûrkistân to *K*înistân, in the direction of the north. 14.
\[The enclosure\] <span id="fr_678"></span>[3](#fn_673) formed by Yim is
*in* the middle of Pârs, in Sruvâ <span id="fr_679"></span>[4](#fn_674);
thus, they say, that *what* Yim formed (Yim-kar*d*) is below Mount
Yimakân <span id="fr_680"></span>[5](#fn_675). 15. Ka*s*mîr is in
Hindûstân.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_632"></span>[115:1](sbe0538.htm#fr_637) For this chapter,
which is numbered XXX by previous translators, we have to depend only on
K20 and TD (see the note on the heading of Chap. XXVIII); and the words
enclosed in brackets are supplied from TD, being either illegible or
omitted in K20.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[115:2](sbe0538.htm#fr_638) Perhaps
'patriarchate' or 'episcopate' would be a better translation of ra*d*îh,
and 'patriarch' or 'bishop' of ra*d*, in this chapter, as the chief
high-priest (dastûr-i dastûrân) and his office are evidently meant by
these words.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[115:3](sbe0538.htm#fr_639) Of the six other
regions, distinct from this one of Khvanîras, see Chap. XI, 2-4.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[115:4](sbe0538.htm#fr_640) TD has
Ashashâg,h*d*-ê aîgh Nêva*n*dãn; both MSS. giving these names in a
barbarous Pâzand form which cannot be relied on. Perhaps this Dastûr is
the Av. Ashâvanghu Biva*n*dangha of Fravardîn Yt. 110.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[115:5](sbe0538.htm#fr_641) TD has
Hôazarôkakhhr-hanâ Parê*s*tyrô, all in Pâzand in both MSS., except Huz.
hanâ, which stands for Pâz. ê, here used for the idhâfat i. Perhaps this
Dastûr is the Av. *G*arô-danghu Pairi*s*tîra of Fravardîn Yt. 110.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[115:6](sbe0538.htm#fr_642) So in TD; K20 has
Pâz. Spaitanid-i Huspâsnyân. This Dastûr is, no doubt, the Av. (gen.)
Spitôi*s* Uspãsnao*s* of Fravardîn Yt. 121.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[115:7](sbe0538.htm#fr_643) Omitted in K20,
but, no doubt, this Dastûr is the Av. Erezrâspa Uspãsnu of Fravardîn Yt.
121.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[115:8](sbe0538.htm#fr_644) Av. Hvaspa of
Fravardîn Yt. 122.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[115:9](sbe0538.htm#fr_645) So in both MSS. As
in the case of each of the preceding two pair of regions, two
consecutive names of Dastûrs have been taken from the Fravardîn Ya*s*t,
it may be supposed that the names <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>
taken for this third pair of regions will also be consecutive, and this
Dastûr must, therefore, be identified with the Av. *K*athwaraspa of
Fravardîn Yt. 122.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[116:1](sbe0538.htm#fr_646) TD has 'Zaratû*s*t
is chief of this region of Khvanîras, and also of the whole world of the
righteous; all chieftainship, also, is from Zaratû*s*t, so that the
whole religion,' &c.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[116:2](sbe0538.htm#fr_647) Justi has 'zones,
climates;' but transcribing Pâz. habâvanhâ back into Pahlavi we have a
word which may be read khabânŏhâ, pl. of khabân, 'a trampling-place'
(comp. Pers. khabîdan). TD has khvabî*s*nŏ-gâs, which has the same
meaning.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[116:3](sbe0538.htm#fr_648) Meaning, probably,
that they resemble the six smaller regions in being isolated and
difficult of access; in other words, either mythical, or independent of
Iranian rule.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[116:4](sbe0538.htm#fr_649) So in TD, which
also omits the second, third, and fourth of these isolated territories.
In K20 we might read ra*d* va khû*d*âk, 'chief and lord,' as an epithet
of Aîrân-vê*g*. This river must be the Nâhvtâk of Chap. XXI, 6.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[116:5](sbe0538.htm#fr_650) Reading Ka*s*mîr-i
andar Hindû, but TD has Ka*s*mîr-i andarûnŏ; perhaps the last word was
originally anîrânak, in which case we should read 'the not-Iranian
Ka*s*mîr.'

<span id="fn_646"></span>[117:1](sbe0538.htm#fr_651) The Av. Peshôtanu
of Vi*s*tâsp Yt. 4, where he is described as free from disease and
death. TD has Pêshyôk-tanû. See also Chaps. XXXI, 29, XXXII, 5.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[117:2](sbe0538.htm#fr_652) TD has
*K*itrô-mâônô, and it may be doubted whether the latter portion of the
name be derived from Av. mainyu, 'spirit,' or m*a*unghô, 'moon.' The
Dâ*d*istân-i-Dînîk (Reply 89) calls him 'Patshâyôtanû who is called from
the *K*îtrôk-mâhanô (or mîyânô),' the *K*atru-mîyân river of Chap. XX,
7, 31.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[117:3](sbe0538.htm#fr_653) See § 10. TD has
Kangde*z*-i bâmîk, 'Kangde*z* the splendid.'

<span id="fn_649"></span>[117:4](sbe0538.htm#fr_654) The Av. Aghraêratha
Narava of Gô*s* Yt. 18, 22, Fravardîn Yt. 131, Ashi Yt. 38, Zamyâd Yt.
77; he is Aghrîrath, brother of Afrâsiyâb, in the Shâhnâmah; see also
Chap. XXXI, 15.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[117:5](sbe0538.htm#fr_655) TD has Pahl.
Sakîkstân here, but Sôkapastân in § 13 (the letters îk and p being often
much alike in Pahlavi writing). K20 has Pâz. Sâvkavatân, S*a*ukâvasta,
and Sâvkavastãn.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[117:6](sbe0538.htm#fr_656) TD has Gôpat-malkâ,
'king of Gôpat;' and Dâ*d*. (Reply 89) states that 'the reign of
Gôpatshah is over the country of Gôpatô, coterminous with Aîrân-vê*g*,
on the bank of the water of the Dâîtîk; *and* he keeps watch over the ox
Hadhayãs, on whom occurred the various emigrations of men of old.' Mkh.
(LXII, 31-36) says, 'Gôpatshâh remains in Aîrân-vê*g*, within the region
of Khvanîras; from foot to mid-body *he is* a bull, and from mid-body to
top *he is* a man; at all times he stays on the sea-shore, and always
performs the worship of God, and always pours holy-water into the sea;
through the pouring of that holy-water innumerable noxious creatures in
the sea will die; for if he should not mostly perform that ceremonial,
and should not pour that holy-water into the sea, and those innumerable
noxious creatures should not perish, then always when rain falls the
noxious creatures would fall like rain.' In Chap. XXXI, 20, he is said
to be a son of Aghrêra*d*.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[117:7](sbe0538.htm#fr_657) So in K20; and Av.
Parsha*d*g*a*u occurs in Fravardîn Yt. 96, 127; but TD has Fradakh*s*tar
Khûmbîkân, and Dâ*d*. (Reply 89) mentions 'Fradhakh*s*tô son of
Khûmbîkân' as one of the seven <span id="page_118">p. 118</span>
immortal lords of Khvanîras, which name corresponds with the Av.
Fradhâkh*s*ti Khu*n*bya of Fravardîn Yt. 138.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[118:1](sbe0538.htm#fr_658) TD has always Pahl.
Pê*s*ânsih. No doubt the Pi*s*în valley is meant (see § 11).

<span id="fn_654"></span>[118:2](sbe0538.htm#fr_659) Or it may be read
Aêshm-i. This phrase occurs only in TD, but Dâ*d*. (Reply 89) mentions
'the Avesta Yakhmâyî*s*a*d*, son of the same Fryânô,' as one of the
seven immortal lords of Khvanîras.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[118:3](sbe0538.htm#fr_660) See Chap. XXVII, 2.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[118:4](sbe0538.htm#fr_661) See Chap. XXXII, 5.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[118:5](sbe0538.htm#fr_662) Or Narsâe in TD;
K20 has Paz. Narêî, but see Chap. XXXI, 3, 5.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[118:6](sbe0538.htm#fr_663) Av. Tusa of Âbân
Yt. 53, 58, and an Iranian warrior in the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[118:7](sbe0538.htm#fr_664) Av. Naotara, whose
descendants are mentioned in Âbân Yt. 76, 98, Fravardîn Yt. 102, Râm Yt.
35.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[118:8](sbe0538.htm#fr_665) Av. Gaêvani of
Fravardîn Yt. 115 is something like this name of one of the Iranian
warriors in the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[118:9](sbe0538.htm#fr_666) TD has Pâz.
Bairazd. Perhaps it is not a name but a Pâzand corruption of Pahl.
aêvarz, 'warrior, trooper' (traditionally); in which case we should have
to read 'the warrior who was a causer of strife.'

<span id="fn_662"></span>[118:10](sbe0538.htm#fr_667) So in TD; K20 has
'Ashavand son of Porudakh*s*t' and Dâ*d*. (Reply 89) mentions
'Ashavazang son of Pôrûdakhstôîh' as one of the seven immortal lords of
Khvanîras. He is the Av. 'Ashavazdangh the Pourudhâkh*s*tiyan' of Âbân
Yt. 72, Fravardîn Yt. 112.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[118:11](sbe0538.htm#fr_668) So in TD, but K20
has 'always.'

<span id="fn_664"></span>[119:1](sbe0538.htm#fr_669) This is not Sâm the
grandfather of Rustam, but the Av. Sâma, who appears to have been an
ancestor of Keresâspa (see Yas. IX, 30), called *S*am, grandfather of
Gar*s*âsp, in a passage interpolated in some copies of the Shâhnâmah
(compare Chap. XXXI, 26, 27). Here, however, it appears from the Bahman
Ya*s*t (III, 59, 60) that Keresâspa himself is meant, he being, called
Sâma Keresâspa in Fravardîn Yt. 61, 136.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[119:2](sbe0538.htm#fr_670) It can also be read
Nihâ*v* or Nîyâ*g* in K20, and Nihâv or Nihân in TD.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[119:3](sbe0538.htm#fr_671) TD has '*as* he lay
*in* the midst of the heat.'

<span id="fn_667"></span>[119:4](sbe0538.htm#fr_672) TD has 'and the
snow (vafar) has settled (nishast) over him.'

<span id="fn_668"></span>[119:5](sbe0538.htm#fr_673) See Chaps. XXXI, 6,
XXXIV, 5.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[119:6](sbe0538.htm#fr_674) See Chap. XII, 31.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[119:7](sbe0538.htm#fr_675) TD has a*g*var,
'above,' instead of min var, 'from the bed.'

<span id="fn_671"></span>[120:1](sbe0538.htm#fr_676) Or, 'the hottest
there, through the very lofty elevation, is not heat.'

<span id="fn_672"></span>[120:2](sbe0538.htm#fr_677) Pers. Âdarbî*g*ân.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[120:3](sbe0538.htm#fr_678) The word var is
omitted in K20.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[120:4](sbe0538.htm#fr_679) TD has Pahl.
Srûbâk.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[120:5](sbe0538.htm#fr_680) Or it may be read
Damakân, but TD has *K*amakân. It can hardly be Dâmaghân, as that is a
town and district in Khurâsân; Justi also suggests the district of
*G*amagân in Pârs, and thinks Sruvâ means 'cypress wood,' there being a
Salvastân between Shîrâz and Fasâ.
