### CHAPTER XXVIII <span id="fr_581"></span>[3](#fn_576).

\[1. On the evil-doing of Aharman *and* the demons it says in
revelation, that the evil which the evil spirit has produced for the
creation of Aûharmazd it is possible to tell by this winter <span
id="fr_582"></span>[4](#fn_577); and his body is that of a lizard
(vazagh) <span id="fr_583"></span>[5](#fn_578) *whose* place is filth
(kal*k*). 2. He does not think, nor speak, nor act *for* the welfare
(nadûkîh) of the creatures of Aûharmazd; and his business is
unmercifulness and the destruction of this *welfare*, so that the
creatures which Aûharmazd shall increase he will destroy; and *his*
eyesight (*k*ashm mî*k*i*s*n) <span id="fr_584"></span>[6](#fn_579) does
not refrain from doing the creatures harm. 3. As it says that, 'ever

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

since a creature was created by, us, I, who am Aûharmazd, have not
rested at ease, on account of providing protection for my own creatures;
and likewise not even he, the evil spirit, on account of contriving evil
for the creatures.' 4. And by *their* devotion to witchcraft
(yâtûk-dînôîh) he seduces mankind into affection for himself and
disaffection to Aûharmazd <span id="fr_585"></span>[1](#fn_580), so that
they forsake the religion of Aûharmazd, and practise that of Aharman. 5.
He casts this into the thoughts of men, that this religion of Aûharmazd
is nought, and it is not necessary to be steadfast in it. 6. Whoever
gives that man anything, in whose law (dâ*d*) this saying is
established, then the evil spirit is propitiated by him, that is, he has
acted by his pleasure.

7\. The business of Akôman <span id="fr_586"></span>[2](#fn_581) is
this, that he gave vile thoughts and discord to the creatures. 8. The
business of the demon Andar is this, that he constrains the thoughts of
the creatures from deeds of virtue, just like a leader who *has*
well-constrained (sardâr-i khûp afsâr*d*ŏ); *and* he casts this into the
thoughts of men, that it is not necessary to have the *sacred* shirt
*and thread*-girdle. 9. The business of the demon Sâvar <span
id="fr_587"></span>[3](#fn_582), that is a leader of the demons, is
this, that is, misgovernment, oppressive anarchy, and drunkenness. 10.
The business of the demon Nâîkîyas <span id="fr_588"></span>[4](#fn_583)
is this, that he gives discontent to the creatures; as it says, that
should this *one*

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

give anything to those men whose opinion (dâ*d*) is this, that it is not
necessary to have the *sacred* shirt *and thread*-girdle, then Andar,
Sâvar, and Nâîkîyas are propitiated by him. 11. The demon Taprê*v* <span
id="fr_589"></span>[1](#fn_584) is he who mingles poison with plants and
creatures; as it says thus: 'Taprê*v* the frustrater, *and* Zâîrî*k* the
maker of poison.' 12. All those six, it is said, are arch-fiends <span
id="fr_590"></span>[2](#fn_585) of the demons; the rest are cooperating
and confederate with them. 13. This, too, it says, that\] <span
id="fr_591"></span>[3](#fn_586) should *one* give \[anything to\] a man
who says \[that it is proper to have one boot\], and in his law walking
with one boot \[is established, then\] <span
id="fr_592"></span>[4](#fn_587) the fiend Taprê*v* is propitiated \[by
him\].

14\. The demon Tarômat <span id="fr_593"></span>[5](#fn_588) \[is he
who\] produces disobedience; the demon Mîtôkht <span
id="fr_594"></span>[6](#fn_589) is the liar (drô*g*an) of the evil
spirit <span id="fr_595"></span>[7](#fn_590); the demon Ara*s*k <span
id="fr_596"></span>[8](#fn_591) ('malice') is the spiteful fiend of the
evil eye. 15. Theirs are the same <span id="fr_597"></span>[9](#fn_592)
appliances as the demon Aeshm's <span id="fr_598"></span>[10](#fn_593),
as it

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

says that seven powers are given *to* Aeshm <span
id="fr_599"></span>[1](#fn_594), that he may utterly destroy the
creatures therewith; with those seven powers he will destroy seven <span
id="fr_600"></span>[2](#fn_595) of the Kayân heroes in his own time,
*but* one will remain. 16. There where Mîtôkht ('falsehood') arrives,
Ara*s*k ('malice') becomes welcome, \[and there where Ara*s*k is
welcome\] <span id="fr_601"></span>[3](#fn_596) Aeshm lays a
foundation <span id="fr_602"></span>[4](#fn_597), and there where Aeshm
has a foundation <span id="fr_603"></span>[5](#fn_598) many creatures
perish, *and* he causes much non-Iranianism <span
id="fr_604"></span>[6](#fn_599). 17. Aeshm mostly contrives all evil for
the creatures of Aûharmazd, *and* the evil deeds of those Kayân heroes
have been more complete through Aeshm, as it says, that Aeshm, the
impetuous assailant, causes them most <span
id="fr_605"></span>[7](#fn_600).

18\. The demon Vîzarêsh <span id="fr_606"></span>[8](#fn_601) is he who
struggles with the souls of men which *have* departed, those

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

days and nights <span id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_602) when *they remain*
in the world; he carries *them* on, terror-stricken, *and* sits at the
gate of hell. 19. The demon Uda <span id="fr_608"></span>[2](#fn_603) is
he who, when a man sits in a private place, or when he eats at meals,
strikes *his* knee spiritually on *his* back <span
id="fr_609"></span>[3](#fn_604), so that he bawls out \[*and* looks out,
that chattering he may eat, chattering\] he may evacuate (rîe*d*), and
chattering he may make water (mêzê*d*), so that he may not attain \[unto
the\] best existence <span id="fr_610"></span>[4](#fn_605) .

\[20. The demon Akâtâsh <span id="fr_611"></span>[5](#fn_606) is the
fiend of perversion (nikîrâyîh), who makes the creatures averse
(nikîrâî) from proper things; as it says, that whoever *has* given
anything to that person (tanû) whose opinion (dâ*d*) is this, that it is
not necessary to have a high-priest (dastôbar), then the demon Aeshm is
propitiated by him. 21. Whoever *has* given anything to that person
whose opinion is this, *and* who says, that it is not necessary to have
a snake-killer (mâr-van), then Aharman, with the foregoing demons, is
propitiated by him; this is said of him who, when he sees a noxious
creature, does not kill *it*. 22. A snake-killer (mâro-gnô) <span
id="fr_612"></span>[6](#fn_607) is a stick on the end of which a
leathern *thong* is

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

provided; and it is declared that every one of the good religion must
possess one, that they may strike *and* kill noxious creatures *and*
sinners more meritoriously with it.

23\. Zarmân <span id="fr_613"></span>[1](#fn_608) is the demon who makes
decrepit (dûspa*d*), whom they call old age (pirîh). 24. *K*îshmak <span
id="fr_614"></span>[2](#fn_609) is he who makes disastrous (vazandak),
and also causes the whirlwind <span id="fr_615"></span>[3](#fn_610)
*which* passes over for disturbance. 25. The demon Varenô <span
id="fr_616"></span>[4](#fn_611) is he who causes illicit intercourse, as
it says thus: 'Varenô the defiling (âlâî).' 26. The demon Bûshâsp <span
id="fr_617"></span>[5](#fn_612) is she who causes slothfulness; Sê*g* is
the fiend (drû*g*) who causes annihilation; and the demon Nîyâz is he
who *causes* distress.

27\. The demon Âz <span id="fr_618"></span>[6](#fn_613) ('greediness')
is he who swallows everything, and when, through destitution, nothing
has come he eats himself; he is that fiendishness which, although the
whole wealth of the world be given up to it, does not fill up and is not
satisfied; as it says, that the eye of the covetous is a noose (gamand),
and *in* it the world is nought. 28. Pû*s* <span
id="fr_619"></span>[7](#fn_614) is the demon who makes a hoard, *and*

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

does not consume *it, and* does not give to any one; as it says, that
the power of the demon Âz is owing to that person who, not content with
his own wife, snatches away even those of others.

29\. The demon Nas <span id="fr_620"></span>[1](#fn_615) is he who
causes the pollution and contamination (nisrû*s*tih), which they call
nasâi ('dead matter'). 30. The demon Frîftâr ('deceiver') is he who
seduces mankind. 31. The demon Spazg <span
id="fr_621"></span>[2](#fn_616) ('slander') is he who brings *and*
conveys discourse (milayâ), *and* it is nothing in appearance such *as*
he says; and he shows that mankind fights *and* apologizes
(avakhshînê*d*), individual with individual. 32. The demon Arâst <span
id="fr_622"></span>[3](#fn_617) ('untrue') is he who speaks falsehood.
33. The demon Aîghâsh <span id="fr_623"></span>[4](#fn_618) is the
malignant-eyed fiend who smites mankind with *his* eye. 24. The demon
Bût <span id="fr_624"></span>[5](#fn_619) is he whom they worship among
the Hindûs, and his growth is lodged in idols, as one worships the horse
*as* an idol <span id="fr_625"></span>[6](#fn_620). 35
Astô-vîdâ*d* <span id="fr_626"></span>[7](#fn_621) is the evil flyer
(vâê-i sarîtar) who seizes the life; as it says that, when

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

*his* hand strokes a man *it is* lethargy, when he casts *it* on the
sick *one it is* fever, when he looks in his eyes he drives away the
life, and they call it death. 36. The demon of the malignant eye
(sûr-*k*ashmîh) is he who will spoil anything which men see, *when* they
do not say 'in the name of God' (yazdân).

37\. With every one of them are many demons *and* fiends co-operating,
to specify whom a second time *would be* tedious; demons, too, who are
furies (khashmakân), are in great multitude it is said. 38. They are
demons of ruin, pain, and growing old (zvârân), producers of vexation
and bile, revivers of grief (nîvagîh), the progeny of gloom, and
bringers of stench, decay, and vileness, who are many, very numerous,
and very notorious; and a portion of all of them is mingled in the
bodies of men, *and their* characteristics are glaring in mankind.

39\. The demon Apâôsh <span id="fr_627"></span>[1](#fn_622) and the
demon Aspen*g*argâk <span id="fr_628"></span>[2](#fn_623) are those who
remain in contest with the rain. 40. Of the evil spirit <span
id="fr_629"></span>[3](#fn_624) are the law of vileness, the religion of
sorcery, the weapons of fiendishness, and the perversion (khâmîh) of
God's works; and

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

his wish is this, that is: 'Do not ask *about* me, and do not understand
me! for if ye ask *about* and understand me, ye *will* not come after
me <span id="fr_630"></span>[1](#fn_625).' 41. This, too, it says, that
the evil spirit remains at the distance of a cry, even at the cry of a
three-year-old cock (kûlêng), even at the cry of an ass, even at the cry
of a righteous man when *one* strikes *him* involuntarily *and* he
utters a cry <span id="fr_631"></span>[2](#fn_626). 42. The demon
Kûndak <span id="fr_632"></span>[3](#fn_627) is he who is, the steed
(bârak) of wizards.

43\. Various new demons *arise* from the various new sins the creatures
may commit, *and* are produced for such *purposes*; who make even those
planets rush *on* which are in the *celestial* sphere, *and* they stand
very numerously in the conflict. 44. Their ringleaders (kamârîkân) are
those seven *planets*, the head and tail of Gô*k*îhar, and
Mû*s*par <span id="fr_633"></span>[4](#fn_628)

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

provided with a tail, *which* are ten. 45. And by them these ten worldly
creations, *that* is, the sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals,
metals, wind, light, fire, and mankind, are corrupted with all this
vileness; and from them calamity, captivity, disease, death, and other
evils and corruptions ever come to water, vegetation, and the other
creations which exist *in* the world, owing to the fiendishness of those
ten. 46. They whom I *have* enumerated are *furnished* with the
assistance and crafty (afzar-hômand) nature of Aharman.

47\. Regarding the cold, dry, stony, and dark interior of mysterious
(târîk dên afrâ*g*-pê*d*âk) hell it says, that the darkness is fit to
grasp with the hand <span id="fr_634"></span>[1](#fn_629), and the
stench is fit to cut with a knife; and if they inflict the punishment of
a thousand men within a single span, they (the men) think in this *way*,
that they are alone; *and* the loneliness is worse than its
punishment <span id="fr_635"></span>[2](#fn_630). 48. And its connection
(band) is with the seven planets, be it through much cold like
Saturn <span id="fr_636"></span>[3](#fn_631) (Kêvân), be it through much
heat like Aharman; and their food is brimstone (gandak), and of
succulents the lizard (vazagh), *and* other evil *and* wretchedness
(patyân).\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_576"></span>[105:3](sbe0537.htm#fr_581) Chaps. XXVIII,
XXIX, and XXXI are omitted in M6 and all MSS. descended from it, whether
Pahlavi or Pâzand; and, owing to the loss of a folio from K20 before any
of its extant copies were written, the first quarter of Chap. XXVIII has
hitherto been missing, but is here supplied (enclosed in brackets) from
TD, a MS. belonging to Mobad Tahmuras Dinshaw (see Introduction).

<span id="fn_577"></span>[105:4](sbe0537.htm#fr_582) Winter being one of
the primary evils brought upon creation by Angra-mainyu (see Vend. I,
8-12).

<span id="fn_578"></span>[105:5](sbe0537.htm#fr_583) See Chap. III, 9.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[105:6](sbe0537.htm#fr_584) Referring to 'the
evil eye.'

<span id="fn_580"></span>[106:1](sbe0537.htm#fr_585) Compare Chap. I,
14.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[106:2](sbe0537.htm#fr_586) The six arch-fiends
of this paragraph are those mentioned in Chaps. I, 27, XXX, 29.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[106:3](sbe0537.htm#fr_587) Written Sôvar in
Chap. I, 27.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[106:4](sbe0537.htm#fr_588) Written Nâkahê*d*
in Chap. I, 27, Nâîkîya*s* when repeated in this sentence, and Pâz.
Nâûnghas in Chap. XXX, 29.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[107:1](sbe0537.htm#fr_589) Written Tâîrê*v* in
Chap. I, 27.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[107:2](sbe0537.htm#fr_590) See Chap. III, 2.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[107:3](sbe0537.htm#fr_591) From this point the
Pahlavi text is extant in K20, except some illegible words, the
translation of which (supplied from TD) is here enclosed in brackets.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[107:4](sbe0537.htm#fr_592) Anquetil, misled by
the lacuna in his MS., thought that there was a change of subject here,
and began a new chapter at this point. On this account the numbers of
his chapters are henceforth one in excess of those in this translation.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[107:5](sbe0537.htm#fr_593) Written Tarôkmatŏ
in TD, and identified with Nâûnghas (Nâîkîyas) in Chap. XXX, 29; a
personification of the Av. tarômaiti, 'disobedience,' of Yas. XXXIII, 4,
LIX, 8.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[107:6](sbe0537.htm#fr_594) A personification
of the Av. mithaokhta, 'false-spoken,' of Yas. LIX, 8, Vend. XIX, 146,
Visp. XXIII, 9, Zamyâd Yt. 96.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[107:7](sbe0537.htm#fr_595) TD has drû*g*
gûmânîkîh, 'the fiend of scepticism.'

<span id="fn_591"></span>[107:8](sbe0537.htm#fr_596) Av. araska of Yas.
IX, 18, Râm Yt. 16, personified.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[107:9](sbe0537.htm#fr_597) The word hômanam in
K20 is a false Huzvâri*s* reading of ham, owing to the copyist reading
am, 'I am;' TD has hamafzâr, 'having like means.'

<span id="fn_593"></span>[107:10](sbe0537.htm#fr_598) Or Khashm,
'wrath;' so written in K20, but it is usually <span id="page_108">p.
108</span> Aêshm elsewhere; the Av. aêshma of Vend. IX, 37, X, 23, 27,
&c. The Asmodeus of the Book of Tobit appears to be the Av. Aêshmô
daêvô, 'demon of wrath.'

<span id="fn_594"></span>[108:1](sbe0537.htm#fr_599) TD has 'there were
seven powers of Aêshm.'

<span id="fn_595"></span>[108:2](sbe0537.htm#fr_600) TD has 'six,' which
looks like an unlucky attempt to amend a correct text. Tradition tells
us that only five Kayâns reigned (see Chap. XXXIV, 7), and the Shâhnâmah
also mentions Sîyâwush (Pahl. Kaî-Sîyâvakhsh), who did not reign; but
eight Kayâns, besides Lôharâsp and Vi*s*tâsp, who were of collateral
descent (see Chap. XXXI, 28), are mentioned in the Avesta, whence the
author of the Bundahi*s* would obtain much of his information (see
Fravardîn Yt. 132, Zamyâd Yt. 71, 74).

<span id="fn_596"></span>[108:3](sbe0537.htm#fr_601) The phrase in
brackets occurs only in TD.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[108:4](sbe0537.htm#fr_602) Reading bunak as in
TD; K20 has 'sends down a root.'

<span id="fn_598"></span>[108:5](sbe0537.htm#fr_603) So in TD; K20 has
'where Aeshm keeps on.'

<span id="fn_599"></span>[108:6](sbe0537.htm#fr_604) That is, 'many
foreign customs.'

<span id="fn_600"></span>[108:7](sbe0537.htm#fr_605) The word vêsh,
'most,' is only in TD.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[108:8](sbe0537.htm#fr_606) So in TD; K20 has
Vi*g*êsh. He is the Av. Vîzaresha of Vend. XIX, 94, who is said to
convey the souls of the departed to the *K*inva*d* bridge.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[109:1](sbe0537.htm#fr_607) TD has 'those three
nights,' referring to the period that the soul is said to remain
hovering about the body after death (see Hâ*d*ôkht Nask, ed. Haug, II,
1-18, III, 1-17).

<span id="fn_603"></span>[109:2](sbe0537.htm#fr_608) So in K20; TD has
Aû*d*ak (see Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 70).

<span id="fn_604"></span>[109:3](sbe0537.htm#fr_609) TD has merely
'strikes a slipper (pa*d*în-pôsh) spiritually,' that is, invisibly, for
the purpose of startling the man.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[109:4](sbe0537.htm#fr_610) The short phrases
in brackets are taken from TD to supply words torn off from K20, which
passes on to Chap. XXIX at this point, but TD supplies a continuation of
Chap. XXVIII, which is added here, and enclosed in brackets.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[109:5](sbe0537.htm#fr_611) The Av. Akatasha of
Vend. X, 23 Sp., XIX, 43 W.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[109:6](sbe0537.htm#fr_612) See Pahlavi Vend.
XVIII, 5, 6.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[110:1](sbe0537.htm#fr_613) A personification
of the Av. zaurva of Vend. XIX, 43 W., Yas. IX, 18 Sp., Gô*s* Yt. 10,
Râm Yt. 16.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[110:2](sbe0537.htm#fr_614) The reading of this
name is uncertain.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[110:3](sbe0537.htm#fr_615) The small
whirlwinds, which usually precede a change of wind in India, are
commonly known by the name of shaîTân, which indicates that such
whirling columns of dust are popularly attributed to demoniacal agency.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[110:4](sbe0537.htm#fr_616) A personification
of Av. varena, 'desire,' in an evil sense.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[110:5](sbe0537.htm#fr_617) Av. Bûshyãsta of
Vend. XI, 28, 29, 36, 37, XVIII, 38, &c. The names of the three demons
in this sentence are Persian words for 'sloth,' 'trouble,' and 'want.'

<span id="fn_613"></span>[110:6](sbe0537.htm#fr_618) Av. Âzi of Vend.
XVIII, 45, 50, Yas. XVII, 46, LXVII, 22, Â*s*tâd Yt. 1.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[110:7](sbe0537.htm#fr_619) Compare Pers.
payû*s*, 'covetous,' and piyûs, 'avarice.' Pû*s* is evidently the demon
of misers, and Âz that of the selfish.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[111:1](sbe0537.htm#fr_620) Av. Nasu of Vend,
V, 85-106, VI, 65, 72, 74, 79, VII, 2-27, 70, VIII, 46, 48, 132-228, IX,
49-1 7, &c.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[111:2](sbe0537.htm#fr_621) Av. spazga of
Ardabahi*s*t Yt. 8, 11, 15.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[111:3](sbe0537.htm#fr_622) Always written like
anâst.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[111:4](sbe0537.htm#fr_623) Av. aghashi of
Vend. XX, 14, 20, 24, which appears to be 'the evil eye;' but see § 36.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[111:5](sbe0537.htm#fr_624) Av. Bûiti of Vend.
XIX, 4, 6, 140, who must be identified with Pers. but, 'an idol,' Sans.
bhûta, 'a goblin,' and not with Buddha.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[111:6](sbe0537.htm#fr_625) Reading afa*s*
vakhsh pavan bûtîhâ mâhmânŏ, *k*îgûn bût asp parastê*d*ŏ, which
evidently admits of many variations, but the meaning is rather obscure.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[111:7](sbe0537.htm#fr_626) Here written
Astî-vîdâ*d* (see Chap. III, 21). Vend. V, 25, 31 says, 'Astô-vîdhôtu
binds him (the dying, man); Vayô (the flying demon) conveys him bound;'
from which it would appear that Astî-vîdâ*d* and 'the evil flyer' were
originally considered as distinct demons.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[112:1](sbe0537.htm#fr_627) Av. Apaosha of
Tî*s*tar Yt. 21, 22, 27, 28, Â*s*tâd Yt. 2, 6; see also Chap. VII, 8,
10, 12.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[112:2](sbe0537.htm#fr_628) Here written
Aspen*g*arôgâ, but see Chaps. VII, 12, XVII, 1. He is the Av.
Spen*g*aghra of Vend. XIX, 135, and, being a demon, is not to be
confounded with the demon-worshipper, Spi*ng*auru*s*ka, of Gô*s* Yt. 31,
Ashi Yt. 51.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[112:3](sbe0537.htm#fr_629) The 'evil spirit,'
Ganrâk-maînôk, seems to be here treated as a demon distinct from
Aharman, which is inconsistent with what is stated in §§ 1-6, and is
contrary to general opinion. This inconsistency would indicate the
possibility of this continuation of Chap. XXVIII in TD, or a portion of
it, having been added by an editor in later times (although it is
difficult to discover any difference of style in the language), if we
did not find a similar confusion of the two names in Chap. XXX, 29, 30.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[113:1](sbe0537.htm#fr_630) Compare Mkh. XL,
24-28: 'The one wish that Hôrmezd, the lord, desires from men is this,
that "ye shall understand me (Hôrmezd), since every one who shall
understand me comes after me, and strives for my satisfaction." And the
one wish that Aharman desires from men is this, that "ye shall not
understand me (Aharman), since whoever shall understand me wicked, *his*
actions proceed not after me, and, moreover, no advantage and friendship
come to me from that man."'

<span id="fn_626"></span>[113:2](sbe0537.htm#fr_631) The sentence is
rather obscure, but it seems to imply that such cries keep the evil
spirit at a distance; it is, however, just possible that it means that
the cry of the evil spirit can be heard as far as such cries.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[113:3](sbe0537.htm#fr_632) Av. Kunda of Vend.
XI, 28, 36, XIX, 138.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[113:4](sbe0537.htm#fr_633) TD has Gôk-*k*ihar
and Mû*s*-parîk here, but see Chap. V, 1, where these beings are
included among the seven planetary leaders, and not counted in addition
to them. This is another inconsistency which leads to the suspicion that
this continuation of the chapter may have been written by a later hand.
According to this later view, the sun and moon must be included among
those malevolent orbs, the planets.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[114:1](sbe0537.htm#fr_634) Compare Mkh. VII,
31: 'and always their darkness is suchlike as though it be possible to
grasp with the hand.'

<span id="fn_630"></span>[114:2](sbe0537.htm#fr_635) Compare
Ar*d*â-Vîrâf-nâmak (LIV, 5-8): '*As close* as the ear to the eye, and as
many as the hairs on the mane of a horse, so *close and* many in number,
the souls of the wicked stand, but they see not, and hear no sound, one
from the other; every one thinks thus, "I am alone.".

<span id="fn_631"></span>[114:3](sbe0537.htm#fr_636) Or, 'with more cold
than Saturn.'
