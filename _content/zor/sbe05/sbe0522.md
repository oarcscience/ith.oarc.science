### CHAPTER XIII.

1\. On the nature of seas it says in revelation, that the wide-formed
ocean keeps one-third of this earth on the south side of the border of
Albûr*z* <span id="fr_211"></span>[8](#fn_210), *and* so

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

wide-formed is the ocean that the water of a thousand lakes is held by
it, such as the source Arêdvîvsûr <span id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_211),
*which* some say is the fountain lake. 2. Every particular lake is of a
particular kind <span id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_212), some are great,
and some are small; some are so large that a man with a horse might
compass *them* around in forty days <span
id="fr_214"></span>[3](#fn_213), which is 1700 leagues (parasang) in
extent.

3\. Through the warmth and clearness of the water, purifying more than
other waters, everything continually flows from the source Arêdvîvsûr.
4. At the south of Mount Albûr*z* a hundred thousand golden channels are
there formed, *and* that water goes with warmth and clearness, through
the channels, on to Hûgar the lofty <span
id="fr_215"></span>[4](#fn_214); on the summit of that mountain is a
lake <span id="fr_216"></span>[5](#fn_215); into that lake it flows,
becomes quite purified, and comes back through a different golden
channel. 5. At the height of a thousand men an open golden branch from
that channel is connected with Mount Aûsîndôm <span
id="fr_217"></span>[6](#fn_216), amid the wide-formed ocean; from there
one portion flows forth to the ocean for the purification of the sea,
*and* one portion drizzles in moisture upon the whole of this earth, and
all the creations of Aûharmazd acquire

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

health from it, and it dispels the dryness of the atmosphere.

6\. Of the salt seas three are principal, *and* twenty-three are small.
7. Of the three which are principal, one is the Pûtîk, one the Kamrû*d*,
and one the *S*ahî-bûn. 8. of all three the Pûtîk <span
id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_217) is the largest, in which is a flow *and*
ebb, on the same side as the wide-formed ocean, *and* it is joined to
the wide-formed ocean. 9. Amid this wide-formed ocean, on the Pûtîk
side, it has a sea which they call the Gulf (var) of Satavês <span
id="fr_219"></span>[2](#fn_218). 10. Thick and salt the stench <span
id="fr_220"></span>[3](#fn_219) wishes to go from the sea Pûtîk to the
wide-formed ocean; with a mighty high wind therefrom, the Gulf of
Satavês drives away whatever is stench, *and* whatever is pure and clean
goes into the wide-formed *ocean* and the source Arêdvîvsûr; *and* that
flows back a second *time* to Pûtîk <span
id="fr_221"></span>[4](#fn_220). 11. The control <span
id="fr_222"></span>[5](#fn_221) of this sea (the Pûtîk) is connected
with the

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

moon and wind; it comes again *and* goes down, in increase and decrease,
because of her revolving. 12. The control <span
id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_222) also of the Gulf of Satavês is attached
to the constellation Satavês, in whose protection are the seas of the
southern quarter, just as *those* on the northern side are in the
protection of Haptôk-ring <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_223). 13.
Concerning the flow *and* ebb it is said, that everywhere from the
presence of the moon two winds continually blow, whose abode is in the
Gulf of Satavês, one they call the down-draught, and one the up-draught;
when the up-draught blows *it is* the flow, and when the down-draught
blows it is the ebb <span id="fr_225"></span>[3](#fn_224). 14. In the
other seas there is nothing of the nature of a revolution of the moon
therein, *and* there are no flow *and* ebb. 15. The sea of
Kamrû*d* <span id="fr_226"></span>[4](#fn_225) is that which they pass
by, in the north, in Taparîstân; that of *S*ahî-bûn <span
id="fr_227"></span>[5](#fn_226) is in Arûm.

16\. Of the small seas that which was most

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

wholesome <span id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_227) was the sea
Kyânsîh <span id="fr_229"></span>[2](#fn_228), *such* as is in Sagastân;
*at* first, noxious creatures, snakes, and lizards (vazagh) were not in
*it*, *and* the water was sweeter *than in* any of the other seas; later
(da*d*îgar) *it became* salt; at the closest, on account of the stench,
it is not possible to go so near as one league, so very great are the
stench and saltness through the violence of the hot wind. 17. When the
renovation *of the universe* occurs it *will* again become sweet <span
id="fr_230"></span>[3](#fn_229).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_210"></span>[41:8](sbe0522.htm#fr_211) Or perhaps better
thus: 'the wide-formed ocean is in the <span id="page_42">p. 42</span>
direction of the south limit of Albûr*z*, *and* possesses one-third of
this earth.'

<span id="fn_211"></span>[42:1](sbe0522.htm#fr_212) The Av. Ardvî sûra
of Âbân Yt. 1, &c.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[42:2](sbe0522.htm#fr_213) Literally, 'for
every single lake *there is* a single kind;' but we may perhaps read lâ,
'not,' instead of the very similar râî, 'for,' and translate as follows:
'every single lake is not of one kind;' which expresses very nearly the
same meaning.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[42:3](sbe0522.htm#fr_214) Compare Âbân Yt.
101.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[42:4](sbe0522.htm#fr_215) See Chap. XII, 5.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[42:5](sbe0522.htm#fr_216) Lake Urvis (see
Chap. XXII, 11).

<span id="fn_216"></span>[42:6](sbe0522.htm#fr_217) See Chaps. XII, 6,
and XVIII, 10, 11.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[43:1](sbe0522.htm#fr_218) The Av. Pûitika of
Vend. V, 52, 57, and evidently the Persian Gulf.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[43:2](sbe0522.htm#fr_219) So called from the
constellation Satavês (§ 12), see Chap. 11, 7. The details given in the
text are applicable to the Gulf and Sea of ’Umân, the Arabian Sea of
Europeans. The description of this Gulf, given in the Pahl. Vend. V, 57,
which is rather obscure, is as follows: 'In purification *the
impurities* flow, in the purity of water, from the sea Pûtîk into the
wide-formed ocean; at the southernmost side *the water* stands back in
mist, and the blue body of Satavês stands back around it. Pûtîk stands
*out* from the side of Satavês, this is where *it is*. From which side
it stands is not clear to me. The water comes to Satavês through the
bottom; some say that it traverses a fissure.'

<span id="fn_219"></span>[43:3](sbe0522.htm#fr_220) Perhaps a better
reading would be stûrg sûr-i gôndakîh, 'the intense saltness which is
stench.' The author appears to have had some vague idea of the monsoon.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[43:4](sbe0522.htm#fr_221) Or, perhaps, 'the
other (the stench) flows back to Pûtîk.'

<span id="fn_221"></span>[43:5](sbe0522.htm#fr_222) Reading band; but it
may be bôd, 'consciousness, sensitiveness.'

<span id="fn_222"></span>[44:1](sbe0522.htm#fr_223) See [p.
43](#page_43), note [5](#fn_221).

<span id="fn_223"></span>[44:2](sbe0522.htm#fr_224) See Chap. II, 7.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[44:3](sbe0522.htm#fr_225) This is not a
confused attempt to explain the tides as the effect of the land and sea
breezes, as might be suspected at first, but is a reasonable conclusion
from imaginary facts. Assuming that the wind always blows eastward and
westward from the moon, it follows that as the moon rises an easterly
wind must blow, which may be supposed to drive the flood tide westward
into the Persian Gulf; until the moon passes the meridian, when the
wind, changing to the west, ought to drive the ebb tide eastward out of
the Gulf thus accounting for one flow and ebb every day, dependent on
the position of the moon.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[44:4](sbe0522.htm#fr_226) Evidently the
Caspian, which lies north of Taparîstân, a province including part of
Mâzendarân.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[44:5](sbe0522.htm#fr_227) Or perhaps
*G*âhî-bûn, meaning probably the Mediterranean or Euxine, if not both of
them; the author appears merely to have heard of the existence of such a
sea in Asia Minor (Arûm). In the Selections of Zâ*d*-sparam, VI, 14, it
is called Gêhân-bûn.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[45:1](sbe0522.htm#fr_228) Comparing nîstûm
with Pers. ni*s*t, 'healthy.'

<span id="fn_228"></span>[45:2](sbe0522.htm#fr_229) The Av. Kãsu of
Vend. XIX, 18, and Zamyâd Yt. 66, 92 (see also Chaps. XX, 34, and XXI,
7). A brackish lake and swamp now called Hâmûn, 'the desert,' or Zarah,
'the sea,' and which formerly contained fresher water than it does now.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[45:3](sbe0522.htm#fr_230) The MSS. here add
the first sentence of Chap. XX, and there is every reason to believe
that Chaps. XX-XXII originally occupied this position, between XIII and
XIV, (see the list of the contents of TD in the Introduction.).
