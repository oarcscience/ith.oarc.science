<p>the soul is to be atoned for among the high-priests (ra<I>d</I>&acirc;n), and when they do whatever the high-priests of the religion command the sin will depart, and the good works which they may thenceforth do will attain completion (avasp&ocirc;rik). 2. The sin of him who is worthy of death (marg-ar<I>g</I>&acirc;n), is to be confessed (gar<I>z</I>i<I>s</I>n&#335;) unto the high-priests, <I>and he</I> is to deliver up <I>his</I> body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1514"></A><A HREF="#fn_1503"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; except <I>to</I> the high-priests he is not to deliver up <I>his</I> body.</p>  
<p>3. On account of the dexterity (farh&acirc;ng) of horsemen it is not <I>their</I> business to hunt (nakh<I>k</I>&icirc;r kar<I>d</I>an&#335;); and it is not allowable for any one else to hunt for game, except <I>for him</I> whose wealth is less <I>than</I> three hundred st&icirc;rs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1515"></A><A HREF="#fn_1504"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

The ceremonial worship (ya<I>z</I>i<I>s</I>n) of those worthy of death, which they do not perform by way of renunciation <I>of sin</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1516"></A><A HREF="#fn_1505"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is the ceremonial <I>which</I> is demon worship; and when the <I>officiating</I> priest (a&ecirc;rpat) does not know <I>it</I> the merit (kirfak) of the ceremonial goes to the store (gan<I>g</I>) of the angels, and they give the enjoyment which <I>arises</I> from that merit in the spiritual <I>existence</I> to the soul of that person who <I>has</I> at once (a&ecirc;v&acirc;<I>k</I>) become righteous in mind.</p>  
<p>5 . When the mortal sinner (marg-ar<I>g</I>&acirc;n&#335;) <I>has</I> delivered his body and wealth at once to the high-priests, and engages mentally in renunciation as to the sin which <I>has</I> occurred, and the high-priests give him <I>their</I> decision (dast&ocirc;bar&icirc;h) as to duty and good works, the duty and good works which <I>were</I> before performed by him come back <I>to him</I>; and when they inflict punishment for three nights&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1517"></A><A HREF="#fn_1506"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he does not enter hell. 6. And if the high-priest orders the cutting off of <I>his</I> head <I>he</I> is righteous on the spot&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1518"></A><A HREF="#fn_1507"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and the three <I>nights&#146;</I> (sat&ucirc;&icirc;h) <I>ceremony</I> is to be celebrated for <I>him</I>, and the account of the</p>

<p>three <I>nights</I> (sat&ucirc;&icirc;h) does not affect him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1519"></A><A HREF="#fn_1508"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 7. And if <I>he does</I> not <I>engage</I> in renunciation <I>he is</I> in hell till the future existence; and in <I>his</I> future body they will bring <I>him</I> from hell, and for every mortal <I>sin</I> they will cut off <I>his</I> head once, and the last time they <I>will</I> make <I>him</I> alive again, and will inflict (num&acirc;yend) three nights&#146; severe punishment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1520"></A><A HREF="#fn_1509"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>8. However a man engages in renunciation of sin the duty of his state of renunciation (pat&icirc;t&icirc;h) is to be engaged therein openly and mentally in renunciation; the duty of openness is this, that the sin which he knows <I>has</I> assailed him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1521"></A><A HREF="#fn_1510"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, is to be specially confessed (bar&acirc; g&ocirc;bi<I>s</I>n&#335;) by him; <I>and</I> the mental duty is this, that he engages in renunciation with this thought, that 'henceforth I <I>will</I> not commit sin.' 9. And that which occurs before the renunciation, except pious alms, it is well for him not to be overlooked&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1522"></A><A HREF="#fn_1511"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> by him, <I>and</I> not to be kept&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1523"></A><A HREF="#fn_1512"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> secret by him; for when he shall overlook&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1524"></A><A HREF="#fn_1513"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, or shall keep secret, about sin committed, it becomes for him as</p>

<p>11. <I>The rule is</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1529"></A><A HREF="#fn_1518"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> this, that <I>of those</I> who would be proper for this priestly duty (dast&ocirc;bar&icirc;h), that person is proper who is perfect in (narm) the commentary (<I>z</I>and) of the law, and the punishment of sin is easy for him, and he has controlled himself; some say thus: 'By whom a course of priestly studies (a&ecirc;rpatast&acirc;n) is performed.' 12. And the punishment of sin <I>being</I> easy for him, and his <I>having</I> controlled himself are proper; and when, in danger before a menstruous woman, he engages in renunciation it is proper.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1502"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1513">300:3</A> Vin&acirc;s-i ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l&acirc;n, 'sin relating to adversaries.' Sins appear to be divided into two great classes, ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l and r&ucirc;b&acirc;n&icirc;k. A ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l sin seems to be any secular offence which injures some person or animal who, thereupon, becomes a ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l, 'accuser' (Av. hameretha, 'opponent,' Yas. LVI, X, 10), and who must first be satisfied by atonement, before confession to the high-priest, or renunciation of sin, can be of any avail for removing the sin (compare Matthew V. 23-26). The Riv&acirc;yats assert that if a person dies without atoning for a ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l sin, his soul will be stopped at the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> bridge (see Bund. XII, 7) on its way to the other world, and kept in a state of torment until the arrival of the 'accuser,' and after he is satisfied the sinner's soul will be disposed of, in the usual manner, according to the balance of its good and bad actions. It is also probable that only a man of 'the good religion,' or an animal of the good creation, can be an 'accuser.' A r&ucirc;b&acirc;n&icirc;k sin, on the other hand, seems to be one which affects only the sinner's own soul, and for which the high-priest can prescribe a sufficient atonement. It is doubtful, however, whether the Parsis nowadays have any very clear notions of the exact distinction between these two classes of sins, although aware of their names, which are mentioned in their Patit, or renunciation of sin. The explanations given in some editions of their Khurdah Avesta, or prayer-book, are confined to mentioning certain special instances of each class of sin; thus, <A NAME="page_301"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 301</FONT></A> murder, seduction, unnecessary slaughter of cattle, embezzlement, slander, seizing land by force, and a few other evil deeds are stated to be ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l sins; while unnatural offences and intercourse with women of another race and religion are said to be r&ucirc;b&acirc;n&icirc;k sins. In the Pahlavi Vendidad these classes of sins are rarely mentioned, but ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l&acirc;n occurs in Pahl. Vend. III, 151, IV, 23, XIII, 38; ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l&icirc;h in III, 119; and r&ucirc;b&acirc;n&icirc;k in XIII, 38; although, perhaps, not always in the sense of sin.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1503"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1514">301:1</A> By committing a marg-ar<I>g</I>&acirc;n or mortal sin, that is, a sin worthy of death, he has forfeited his life, and ought to place it at the disposal of the ra<I>d</I>, or high-priest.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1504"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1515">301:2</A> This section, intended to preserve game for the poor, is evidently out of place here, as it has no connection with the context. With reference to the property qualification for hunting, it appears, from a passage in the Persian MS. M5 about the proper dowry for a privileged wife, that 2000 dirhams of silver were worth 2300 r&ucirc;p&icirc;s, and that 2 dirhams were 2&frac14; tolas; this was written in A.D. 1723, when neither the r&ucirc;p&icirc; nor the tola were of uniform amount, though now the r&ucirc;p&icirc; is exactly a tola weight of silver. As the st&icirc;r was four dirhams (see Chap. I, 2), three hundred st&icirc;rs would have been 1380 r&ucirc;p&icirc;s or 1350 tolas of silver, according to the standards, mentioned in M5; so that hunting was intended to be confined to those whose property was less than 1350-1380 r&ucirc;p&icirc;s; but how <A NAME="page_301"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 301</FONT></A> this limitation is to be reconciled with the fact that hunting was a favourite pursuit of kings and nobles does not appear, unless it be considered as a sacerdotal protest against that practice.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1506"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1517">302:2</A> This appears to refer to temporal punishment, inflicted by order of the high-priest, for the purpose of saving him from the 'punishment of the three nights' in the other world, mentioned in Bund. XXX, 16.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1508"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1519">303:1</A> That is, the usual ceremonies after death are not to be withheld in this world, and his soul is able to pass through the usual investigation, as to his sins and good works, on its way to the other world, without delay. This period of three nights (sat&ucirc;&icirc;h, 'the triplet'), which P&acirc;zand writers miscall sed&ocirc;<I>s</I> or sadis, is the time during which the soul is supposed to hover about the body, before finally departing for the other world (see Mkh.

I, 7, but it is hazardous to identify an individual by a single name so common as &Acirc;tar&ocirc;-p&acirc;<I>d</I> used to be.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1517"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1528">304:4</A> Reading a&ecirc;, 'one,' instead of han&acirc;, 'this' (see p. 218, note 3).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1518"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1529">304:5</A> Assuming that the word &acirc;&icirc;nak has been omitted at the beginning of this section (see Chap. X, x).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1519"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1530">305:1</A> This cannot be the learned Parsi translator of several Pahlavi texts into Sanskrit, who bore the same name, and is supposed to have lived in the fifteenth century. Being quoted in the Pahlavi Vendidad (see Chap. I, 4, note) he must have been one of the old commentators.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1520"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1531">305:2</A> K20 has h&ocirc;manam, 'I am,' instead of ham, 'the same;' a mistake arising from reading am, 'I am,' for ham.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1521"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1532">305:3</A> This applies to all cases of merely imputed sin, such as those committed by children, which are imputed to the father, and for which he is spiritually, as well as temporally, responsible.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1522"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1533">305:4</A> Reading pavan, 'on,' instead of bar&acirc;, 'out of,' (see <A HREF="sbe0552.htm#page_176">p. 176</A>, note <A HREF="sbe0552.htm#fn_989">5</A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1523"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1534">305:5</A> Most of this clause is omitted in K20 by mistake.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1524"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1535">306:1</A> Ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l&acirc;n (see &sect; 1); the particular instance of ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l sin here referred to is seduction.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1525"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1536">306:2</A> Reading d&ucirc;<I>s</I>m&icirc;n&acirc;n instead of the unmeaning d&ucirc;<I>s</I>m&icirc;y&acirc;n of the MSS.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1526"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1537">306:3</A> Reading y&acirc;&icirc;ty&ucirc;n&atilde;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1541"></A><A HREF="#fn_1528"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, instead of the unmeaning y&acirc;&icirc;tam of the MSS; &atilde; being often written very much like m in Pahlavi.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1527"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1538">306:4</A> This clause about the ham&ecirc;m&acirc;l sin becoming a debt, to be settled with the 'accuser,' either here or hereafter, is taken from Pahl. Vend. III, 151.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1528"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1541">306:5</A> That is, r&ucirc;b&acirc;n&icirc;k-sin (see &sect; 1, note).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1529"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1540">306:6</A> See Chap. I, 4, note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1530"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1542">307:1</A> See Chap. I, 4, note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1531"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1543">307:2</A> A blank space is left for this verb in M6, indicating that that MS. was, copied from an original already old and not very legible.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1532"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1544">307:3</A> See Chap. I, 1, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1533"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1545">307:4</A> Consecrating a sacred cake is a Tan&acirc;p&ucirc;har good work (see Chap. XVI, 6). The theory of counterbalancing sins by good works of the same weight is here clearly enunciated.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1534"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1546">307:5</A> Written izimn in the MSS. This quotation appears to be, from some part of the Avesta, no longer extant, and being only the first words of the passage its exact meaning is very uncertain. The section, generally, seems to refer to the beneficence of A&ucirc;harmazd.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1535"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1547">308:1</A> It seems that the execution of the sinner after repentance is here considered as furnishing him with a store of good works, so that it is allowable to perform such ceremonies for him, after death, as are usually performed for righteous men; the reason being given in &sect; 23. The end of this section and beginning of the next are omitted in K20.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1536"></A><A HREF="sbe0568.htm#fr_1548">308:2</A> Whether the prime minister of Sh&acirc;p&ucirc;r II, or the last editor of the D&icirc;nkar<I>d</I> (see Bund. XXXIII, 3, 11), is not clear.</P>
