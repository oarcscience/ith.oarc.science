### CHAPTER XVIII.

1\. On the nature of the tree they call Gôkar*d* <span
id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_329) it says in revelation, that *it was* the
first day when the tree they call Gôkar*d* grew in the deep mud <span
id="fr_332"></span>[2](#fn_330) within the wide-formed ocean; *and* it
is necessary as a producer of the renovation *of the universe*, for they
prepare its immortality therefrom. 2. The evil spirit has formed
therein, among those which enter as opponents, a lizard <span
id="fr_333"></span>[3](#fn_331) as an opponent in that deep water, so
that it may injure the Hôm <span id="fr_334"></span>[4](#fn_332). 3. And
for keeping away that lizard, Aûharmazd has created there ten Kar
fish <span id="fr_335"></span>[5](#fn_333) which, at all times,
continually circle around the Hôm, so that the head of one of those fish
is continually towards the lizard. 4. And together with the lizard those
fish are spiritually fed <span id="fr_336"></span>[6](#fn_334), that is,
no food is necessary for them; *and* till the renovation *of the
universe* they remain in contention. 5. There are places *where* that
fish is

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

written *of as* 'the Ari*z* <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_335) of the
water;' as it says that the greatest of the creatures of Aûharmazd is
that fish, and the greatest of those *proceeding* from the evil spirit
is that lizard; with the jaws of *their* bodies, moreover, they snap in
two whatever of the creatures of both *spirits has* entered between
them, except that one fish which is the Vâs of Pan*k*âsa*d*varân <span
id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_336). 6. This, too, is said, that those fish
are so serpent-like <span id="fr_339"></span>[3](#fn_337) in that deep
water, they know the scratch (mâli*s*n) of a needle's point by which the
water shall increase, or by which it is diminishing.

7\. Regarding the Vâs of Pan*k*âsa*d*varân it is declared that it moves
within the wide-formed ocean, and its length is as much as what a man,
while in a swift race, will walk *from* dawn till when the sun goes
down; so much that it does not itself move <span
id="fr_340"></span>[4](#fn_338) the length of the whole of its great
body. 8. This, too, is said, that the creatures of the waters live also
specially *under* its guardianship.

9\. The tree of many seeds has grown amid the wide-formed ocean, and in
its seed are all plants; some say *it is* the proper-curing, some the
energetic-curing, some the all-curing <span
id="fr_341"></span>[5](#fn_339).

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

10\. Between <span id="fr_342"></span>[1](#fn_340) these trees of such
kinds <span id="fr_343"></span>[2](#fn_341) is formed the mountain with
cavities, 9999 thousand myriads *in number*, each myriad being ten
thousand. 11. Unto that mountain is given the protection of the waters,
so that water streams forth from there, in the rivulet channels, to the
land of the seven regions, as the source of all the sea-water in the
land of the seven regions is from there <span
id="fr_344"></span>[3](#fn_342).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_329"></span>[65:1](sbe0527.htm#fr_331) A corruption of the
Av. gaokerena of Vend. XX, 17, Aûharmazd Yt. 30, Haptân Yt. 3, Sîrôz, 7.
In the old MSS. of the Bundahi*s* the form gôkar*d* occurs thrice,
gôkarn once, and gogrv once.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[65:2](sbe0527.htm#fr_332) Reading gil, 'mud.'
Windischmann and Justi prefer gar, 'mountain,' and have 'depth of the
mountain.'

<span id="fn_331"></span>[65:3](sbe0527.htm#fr_333) That the writer of
the Bundahi*s* applies the term vazagh to a lizard, rather than a frog,
appears from the 'log-like lizard's body' of Chap. III, 9.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[65:4](sbe0527.htm#fr_334) That is, the
Gôkar*d* tree, which is the white Hôm (see Chap. XXVII, 4).

<span id="fn_333"></span>[65:5](sbe0527.htm#fr_335) The Av. karô masyô
of Vend. XIX, 140, Bahrâm Yt. 29, Dîn Yt. 7; see also Chap. XXIV, 13.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[65:6](sbe0527.htm#fr_336) Windischmann and
Justi prefer translating thus: 'Moreover, the lizard is the spiritual
food of those fish;' but this can hardly be reconciled with the Pahlavi
text.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[66:1](sbe0527.htm#fr_337) See Chaps. XIV, 26,
and XXIV, 13.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[66:2](sbe0527.htm#fr_338) The Av. vâsîm yãm
pa*nk*âsadvarãm of Yas. XLI, 27.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[66:3](sbe0527.htm#fr_339) Transcribing the
Pâz. mârâdu into Pahlavi we have mâr âyin, 'snake's manner.' Compare the
text with Bahrâm Yt. 29.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[66:4](sbe0527.htm#fr_340) K20 omits the words
from 'walk' to 'move.'

<span id="fn_339"></span>[66:5](sbe0527.htm#fr_341) This is the tree of
the saêna or Simurgh, as described in Rashnu Yt. 17, and these three
epithets are translations of its three titles, hubi*s*, eredhwô-bi*s*,
and vîspô-bi*s*. See also Chap. XXVII, 2, 3.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[67:1](sbe0527.htm#fr_342) This must have been
the original meaning of the Huz. dên (bên in the Sasanian inscriptions)
before it was used as a synonym of Pâz. andar, 'within.' The mountain is
between the white-Hôm tree and the tree of many seeds.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[67:2](sbe0527.htm#fr_343) Transcribing the
Pâz. oînoh into Pahlavi we have ân-gûnak, 'that kind;' or the word may
be a miswriting of Pâz. ânô, 'there.'

<span id="fn_342"></span>[67:3](sbe0527.htm#fr_344) This description of
the mountain seems to identify it with the Aûsîndôm mountain of Chaps.
XII, 6, and XIII, 5.
