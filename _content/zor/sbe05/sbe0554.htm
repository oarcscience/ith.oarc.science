<p>pure propitious liturgy (m&acirc;nsarspend), as heard from G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>; <I>and</I> A&ucirc;harmazd, in pure meditation, considered that which is good and righteousness as destruction of the fiend (dr&ucirc;<I>g</I>&ocirc;). 2. And when he (G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>) passed away eight kinds of mineral of a metallic character arose from <I>his</I> various members; they are gold, silver, iron, brass, tin, lead, quicksilver (&acirc;<I>v</I>g&icirc;nak&#335;), and adamant; <I>and</I> on account of the perfection of gold it is produced from the life and seed.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1015"></A><A HREF="sbe0554.htm#fr_1022">183:1</A> Compare Bund. XV, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1016"></A><A HREF="sbe0554.htm#fr_1023">183:2</A> The MS. has Mash&acirc;&icirc; Mash&acirc;y&ecirc;, but see Bund. XV, 6. The Avesta forms were probably mashya mashy&ocirc;i (or mashy&ecirc;), which are regular nominatives dual, masculine and feminine, of mashya, 'mortal,' and indicate that they were usually coupled together in some part of the Avesta which is no longer extant. P&acirc;zand writers have found it easy to read Mashyan&icirc; instead of M&acirc;shy&ocirc;&icirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1017"></A><A HREF="sbe0554.htm#fr_1024">183:3</A> Reading ham-ba<I>s</I>n&#335; ham-dakh&icirc;k, but whether this is more likely to be the original reading than the ham-badi<I>s</I>n va ham-dasak of Bund. XV, 2, is doubtful. The last epithet here might also be read ham-sab&icirc;k, 'having the same shirt,' but this is an improbable meaning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1018"></A><A HREF="sbe0554.htm#fr_1025">183:4</A> It is evident that ham-bandi<I>s</I>n&icirc;h, 'mutual connection,' in accordance with Bund. XV, 3, would be preferable to the ham-ba<I>s</I>n&#335;&icirc;h, 'like stature,' of this text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1019"></A><A HREF="sbe0554.htm#fr_1026">184:1</A> The old word nism&ocirc;, 'soul' (see Bund. XV, 3, 4), has become corrupted here (by the omission of the initial stroke) into gadman, 'glory.' This corruption may be due either to D&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam not understanding the word (in which case the Bundahi<I>s</I> must have been an old book in his time), or else to some later copyist confounding the old word for 'soul' with the better-known 'glory' of the Iranian sovereigns.</P>
