<p>1. This, too, Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t asked of A&ucirc;harmazd, that is: 'Which is the time when <I>one</I> must not eat meat?'</p>  
<p>2. A&ucirc;harmazd gave a reply thus: 'In a house when a person shall die, until three nights are completed, nothing whatever of meat is to be placed on a sacred cake (dr&ocirc;n) therein and in <I>its</I> vicinity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1896"></A><A HREF="#fn_1884"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; but these, such as milk, cheese, fruit, eggs, and preserves, are to be placed; <I>and</I> nothing whatever of meat is to be eaten <I>by</I> his relations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1897"></A><A HREF="#fn_1885"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 3. In all the three days it is necessary to perform the ceremonial (ya<I>z</I>i<I>s</I>n) of Sr&ocirc;sh for this <I>reason</I>, because Sr&ocirc;sh will be able to save his soul from the hands of the demons <I>for</I> the three days&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1898"></A><A HREF="#fn_1886"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; and when <I>one</I> constantly</p>

<p>7. <I>In</I> one place <I>it</I> is declared, that of him whose begetting is owing to the demons, of him who commits sodomy, and of him who performs the religious rites (d&icirc;n&ocirc;) of apostasy, of none of the three do</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_385"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 385</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they restore the dead&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1904"></A><A HREF="#fn_1892"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for this <I>reason</I>, because he whose begetting is owing to the demons is himself a demon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1905"></A><A HREF="#fn_1893"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and the soul of him who commits sodomy will become a demon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1906"></A><A HREF="#fn_1894"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and the soul of him <I>who</I> performs the religious rites of apostasy will become a darting snake&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1907"></A><A HREF="#fn_1895"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>8. This, too, is revealed by the Avesta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1908"></A><A HREF="#fn_1896"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, that A&ucirc;harmazd spoke thus: 'Give ye up the persons of all men, with the submissiveness of worshippers, <I>to</I> that man to whom the whole Avesta and Zand is easy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1909"></A><A HREF="#fn_1897"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, so that he may make you acquainted with duties and good works; because men go to hell for this <I>reason</I>, when they do not submit <I>their</I> persons to priestly control (a&ecirc;rpatist&acirc;n), and do not become acquainted with duties and good works.'</p>  
<p>9. Query:&#151;There is an action which, according to the Avesta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1910"></A><A HREF="#fn_1898"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, is not good for a person to do, <I>and</I> the sentence of 'worthy of death' is set upon <I>it</I>; for <I>one's</I> better preservation is <I>one</I> not to do that action,</p>

<p>or to accomplish <I>and</I> urge <I>it</I> on, for the advance of religion in a state of uncertainty (var-h&ocirc;mand&icirc;h)? 10. The answer is this, that when they act well for <I>their</I> better preservation <I>there</I> is no fear, on account of acting well, but <I>one</I> is not to forsake that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1911"></A><A HREF="#fn_1899"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, too, though <I>it</I> be not goodness; a forsaken duty is very bad, for a contempt of it enters into one.</p>  
<p>11. This, too, is declared, that Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t enquired of A&ucirc;harmazd thus: 'From what place do these people rise again? from that place where they first went into <I>their</I> mothers, or from that place where the mothers have given <I>them</I> birth, or from that place where <I>their</I> bodies happen <I>to be</I> (a&ucirc;ft&ecirc;<I>d</I>)?' 12. A&ucirc;harmazd gave a reply thus: 'Not from that place where they have gone into <I>their</I> mothers, nor from that place where they have been born from <I>their</I> mothers, nor from that place where <I>their</I> bodies and flesh happen <I>to be</I>, for they rise from that place where the life went out from their bodies.' 13. And this, too, he asked, that is: 'Whence do they raise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1912"></A><A HREF="#fn_1900"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>him</I> again who is suspended from anything, <I>and</I> shall die in the air?' 14. The reply <I>was:</I> 'From that place where his bones and flesh first fall to the ground; hence, except when he shall die on a divan (g&acirc;s) or a bed (vistarg), before they carry him away, whatever <I>it</I></p>

VIII, 64 in old MSS.; this reading is, however, somewhat doubtful here, and perhaps we ought to read 'on a sacred cake in that roofed place (pavan zak v&acirc;mk&icirc;n&icirc;h);' the last word being a possible term for 'roofing' as it stands, though it may be a miswriting of v&acirc;mp&ocirc;<I>s</I> (Pers. b&acirc;mp&ocirc;<I>s</I>, 'roofing').</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1885"></A><A HREF="sbe0577.htm#fr_1897">382:2</A> The Parsis, nowadays (Dast&ucirc;r Hoshangji says), do not cook for three days under a roof where a death has occurred, but obtain food from their neighbours and friends; but if the cookroom he under a separate roof, as often happens in India, they have no objection to cooking there.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1886"></A><A HREF="sbe0577.htm#fr_1898">382:3</A> The soul is supposed to hover about the body for the first three nights after death, during which time it has to rely upon the angel Sr&ocirc;sh (see Bund. XXX, 29) for protection from the demons, which the angel, it is presumed, will afford more efficiently if properly propitiated by the surviving relatives. At the third dawn after death (that is, the dawn of the fourth day inclusive of the day of death) the soul is supposed to depart finally for the other world (see AV. IV, 8-36, XVII, 5-27).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1887"></A><A HREF="sbe0577.htm#fr_1899">383:1</A> These periods of the day are five in summer, and four in winter (see Bund. XXV, 9, 10).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1888"></A><A HREF="sbe0577.htm#fr_1900">383:2</A> The usual name of the angel R&acirc;m (the Vayu of R&acirc;m Yt.) who, with the angels Rashn&ucirc; and &Acirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;<I>d</I>, is supposed to be stationed at the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> bridge, where the soul has to give an account of its actions during life shortly after the dawn following the third night after death (see AV. V. 3, CI, 21, note, Mkh. II, 115).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1889"></A><A HREF="sbe0577.htm#fr_1901">383:3</A> This clothing must be new and good, and is supposed to be supplied to the spirit to prevent its appearing unclothed in the other world, where the clothing of the soul is said to be formed 'out of almsgivings' (Chap. XII, 4); to fulfil which condition the clothes provided are presented to the officiating priests (see Saddar Bundahi<I>s</I> LXXXVII).</P>

With regard to the ceremonies after a death, the Persian Riv&acirc;yats give more details, which may be summarized as follows:&#151;On each of the first three days a Sr&ocirc;sh Ya<I>s</I>t is performed and a Sr&ocirc;sh Dr&ocirc;n consecrated (see Chap. III, 32, note). On the third night, in the middle of the Aiwisr&ucirc;threm G&acirc;h (dusk to midnight), a renunciation <A NAME="page_384"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 384</FONT></A> of sin is performed in the house of the deceased; and in the Ushahin G&acirc;h (midnight to dawn) four Dr&ocirc;ns are consecrated, one dedicated to the good V&acirc;&ecirc; (N&acirc;-&icirc; veh), one to Rashn and &Acirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;<I>d</I>, one to Sr&ocirc;sh, and one to the righteous (ash&ocirc;&acirc;n), and in front of the last are placed new and clean clothes with fruit, but without an egg. On the fourth day, at sunrise, the Dahm&acirc;n &Acirc;fr&icirc;ng&acirc;n (Yas. LIX) is recited, and then the Kh&ucirc;rsh&ecirc;<I>d</I> and Mihir Ny&acirc;yi<I>s</I>, after which the people in the house can first eat fresh-cooked meat. During the fourth day also the Ya<I>s</I>t of the righteous is performed, and the Dr&ocirc;n of the righteous is consecrated; and the same again on the tenth day, together with the recitation of the Dahm&acirc;n &Acirc;fr&icirc;ng&acirc;n. On the thirtieth day the S&icirc;r&ocirc;zah (praise of the thirty days) is to be celebrated, with the dedication to the thirty days; thirty-three beans (l&ucirc;vak) and thirty-three eggs, with fruit, being placed in front of the Dr&ocirc;n, which is consecrated in the presence of fire; and, afterwards, the assistant priest consecrates a Dr&ocirc;n for Sr&ocirc;sh. The next day the chief priest consecrates a Dr&ocirc;n for the righteous; a suit of clothes and fruit being placed in front of the Dr&ocirc;n. And each day a Ya<I>s</I>t of the righteous is performed, a Dr&ocirc;n of the righteous is consecrated, and an &Acirc;fr&icirc;ng&acirc;n recited. On the same day every month the same Ya<I>s</I>t, Dr&ocirc;n, and, &Acirc;fr&icirc;ng&acirc;n are celebrated; a priest also undergoes the Bareshn&ucirc;m for the deceased, a G&ecirc;t&icirc;-khar&icirc;<I>d</I> (see Bund. XXX, 28) is performed, and three Vendidads dedicated to Sr&ocirc;sh. On each day at the end of a year the S&icirc;r&ocirc;zah Ya<I>s</I>t is performed, and a Dr&ocirc;n <A NAME="page_385"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 385</FONT></A> dedicated to the thirty days is consecrated, thirty-three beans being placed, with one Dr&ocirc;n, one Frasast (see Chap. III, 32, note), one pentagonal Dr&ocirc;n as the sun, one crescent-shaped as the moon, thirty-three eggs, and fruit, in front of the Dr&ocirc;n, which is consecrated in the presence of fire; afterwards, the assistant priest consecrates a Dr&ocirc;n for Sr&ocirc;sh, and recites the Dahm&acirc;n &Acirc;fr&icirc;ng&acirc;n, and the next day the chief priest consecrates a Dr&ocirc;n for the righteous, a suit of clothes being placed before the Dr&ocirc;n, and recites the Dahm&acirc;n &Acirc;fr&icirc;ng&acirc;n.</P>
