### CHAPTER III.

1\. Zaratû*s*t enquired of Aûharmazd thus: 'O Aûharmazd, propitious
spirit! creator of the material world, righteous *one*! whence do they
restore this good religion of the Mazdayasnians? and by what means will
they destroy these demons with dishevelled hair <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[1](#fn_1119), of the race of Wrath? 2. O creator!
grant me death! and grant my favoured ones death I that they may not
live in that perplexing time; grant *them* exemplary living! that they
may not prepare wickedness and the way to hell.'

3\. Aûharmazd spoke thus: 'O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! after the
ill-omened <span id="fr_1127"></span>[2](#fn_1120) sovereignty of those
of the race of Wrath <span id="fr_1128"></span>[3](#fn_1121) there is a
fiend, Shê*d*âspîh <span id="fr_1129"></span>[4](#fn_1122) of the
Kilisyâkîh, from the countries of Salmân <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[5](#fn_1123);' Mâhvand-dâ*d*

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

said that *these people* are Rûman (Arûmâyîk), and Rôshan <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[1](#fn_1124) said that they have red weapons, red
banners, *and* red hats (kûlâh). 4. 'It is when a symptom of them
appears, as they advance, O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! the sun and the
dark show signs, and the moon becomes manifest of various colours;
earthquakes (bûm-gu*z*and), too, become numerous, and the wind comes
mote violently; in the world want, distress, and discomfort come more
into view; and Mercury and Jupiter advance the sovereignty for the
vile <span id="fr_1132"></span>[2](#fn_1125), *and* they are *in*
hundreds and thousands and myriads. 5. They have the red banner of the
fiend Shê*d*âspîh of Kilisyâkîh, and they hasten much their progress to
these countries of Iran *which* I, Aûharmazd, created, up to the bank of
the Arvand <span id="fr_1133"></span>[3](#fn_1126),' some have
said <span id="fr_1134"></span>[4](#fn_1127) the Frât <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[5](#fn_1128) river, 'unto the Greeks (Yûnân)
dwelling in Asûristân;' they are Greeks by strict reckoning <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[6](#fn_1129),

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

and their Assyrian dwelling is this, that they slay the Assyrian people
therein, and thus they will destroy their abode, some have said the
*lurking*-holes (grêstak) of the demons.

6\. ‘They turn back those of the race of Wrath <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1](#fn_1130) in hundreds and thousands and myriads;
*and* the banners, standards, and an innumerable army of those demons
with dishevelled hair will come to these countries of Iran which I,
Aûharmazd, created. 7. And the army of the invader <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[2](#fn_1131) is an extending enemy of the
Tûrk <span id="fr_1139"></span>[3](#fn_1132) and even the Karm <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[4](#fn_1133), be it with banners aloft when he
shall set up a banner, be it through the excessive multitude which will
remain—like *hairs in* the mane of a horse—in the countries of Iran
which I, Aûharmazd, created.

8\. 'The leathern-belted Tûrk *and* the Rûman Shê*d*âspîh of Kilisyâkîh
come forth with simultaneous movement <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[5](#fn_1134), and in three places, with similar
strife, there was and *will* be three times a great contest (âr*d*îh), O
Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! One in the reign of Kaî-Kâûs <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[6](#fn_1135), When through

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

the assistance of demons *it was* with the archangels; and the second
when thou, O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! receivedst the religion and
*hadst* thy conference, *and* King Vi*s*tâsp and Ar*g*âsp <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[1](#fn_1136), miscreated by wrath, *were*, through
the war of the religion, in the combat of Spê*d*-ra*z*ûr ("the hoary
forest <span id="fr_1144"></span>[2](#fn_1137)"),' some have said *it
was* in Pars; 'and the third when it is the end of thy millennium, O
Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! when all the three, Tûrk, Arab, and Rûman, come
to this <span id="fr_1145"></span>[3](#fn_1138) place,' some have said
the plain of Nî*s*ânak <span id="fr_1146"></span>[4](#fn_1139). 10. 'And
all *those of* the countries of Iran, which I, Aûharmazd, created, come
from their own place unto Pa*d*ashkhvârgar <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[5](#fn_1140), owing to those of the race of Wrath,
O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! so that a report of something of the cave
dwellings, mountain dwellings, and river dwellings of these people will
remain at Pa*d*ashkhvârgar and Pârs; some have *said* the fire
Vi*s*nâsp <span id="fr_1148"></span>[6](#fn_1141), on the deep Lake
*K*ê*k*ast which has medicinal water opposed to the demons, is there (in
Pa*d*ashkhvârgar?) as it were conspicuous,' some have said
'originating <span id="fr_1149"></span>[7](#fn_1142),' 'so that

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

they may use *it* anew, *and* the fire may become shining in these
countries of Iran which I, Aûharmazd, created. 11. For when one shall be
able to save his own life, he has then no recollection of wife, child,
and wealth, that they may not live, *in* that perplexing time, O
Zaratû*s*t! yet the day when the hundredth winter becomes the end of thy
millennium, which is *that* of Zaratû*s*t, is so that nothing wicked may
go from this millennium into that millennium <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1](#fn_1143).'

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

12\. Zaratû*s*t enquired of Aûharmazd thus: 'O Aûharmazd, propitious
spirit! creator of the material world, righteous *one*! when they are so
many in number, by what means will they be able to perish <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[1](#fn_1144)?'

13\. Aûharmazd spoke thus: 'O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! when the demon
with dishevelled hair of the race of Wrath comes into notice in the
eastern quarter, first a black token becomes manifest, *and* Hûshê*d*ar
*son* of Zaratû*s*t is born on Lake Frazdân <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[2](#fn_1145). 14. It is when he comes to his
conference *with* me <span id="fr_1153"></span>[3](#fn_1146), Aûharmazd,
O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân!' *that in* the direction of *K*înistân <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[4](#fn_1147), *it* is said—some have said among the
Hindus—'is born a prince (kaî); it is his father, a prince of the Kayân
race, approaches the

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

women, and a religious prince is born to him; he calls *his* name Vâhrâm
the Var*g*âvand <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1](#fn_1148),' some have said
Shahpûr. 15. 'That a sign may come to the earth, the night when that
prince is born, a star falls from the sky; when that prince is born the
star shows a signal.' 16. It is Dâ*d*-Aûharmazd <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[2](#fn_1149) *who* said that the month Âvân and day
Vâ*d* <span id="fr_1157"></span>[3](#fn_1150) is his father's end; ‘they
rear *him* with the damsels of the king, *and* a woman becomes ruler.

17\. 'That prince when he is thirty years old'—some have told the
time—'*comes* with innumerable banners *and* divers armies, Hindu and
*K*înî <span id="fr_1158"></span>[4](#fn_1151), having uplifted
banners—for they set up *their* banners—having exalted banners, and
having exalted weapons; they hasten up with speed <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[5](#fn_1152) as far as the Vêh river'—some have
said the country of Bambŏ <span id="fr_1160"></span>[6](#fn_1153)—'as
far as Bukhâr and the Bukhârans within its bank,

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O Zaratû*s*t the
Spîtâmân! 18. When the star Jupiter comes up to *its* culminating point
(bâlist) <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1](#fn_1154) and casts Venus down,
the sovereignty comes to the prince. 19. Quite innumerable are the
champions, furnished with arms *and* with banners displayed,' some have
said from Sagastân, Pârs, and Khûrâsân, some have said from the lake of
Pa*d*ashkhvârgar <span id="fr_1162"></span>[2](#fn_1155), some have said
from the Hirâtîs <span id="fr_1163"></span>[3](#fn_1156) and Kôhistân,
some have said from Taparistân <span id="fr_1164"></span>[4](#fn_1157);
and from those directions ‘*every* supplicant for a child <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[5](#fn_1158) comes into <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[6](#fn_1159) view. 26. It is concerning the
displayed banners and very numerous army, which were the armed men,
champions, and soldiers from the countries of Iran at
Pa*d*ashkhvârgar—whom *I* told thee <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[7](#fn_1160) that they call both Kur*d* and
Karmân—it is declared

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

that they will slay an excessive number, in companionship *and under*
the same banner, for these countries of Iran.

21\. 'Those of the race of Wrath and the extensive army <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[1](#fn_1161) of Shê*d*âspîh, *whose* names are the
two-legged wolf and the leathern-belted demon on the bank of the
Arvand <span id="fr_1169"></span>[2](#fn_1162), wage three battles, one
in Spê*d*-ra*z*ûr <span id="fr_1170"></span>[3](#fn_1163) and one in the
plain of Nî*s*ânak;' some have said that *it was* on the lake of the
three races, some have said that *it was* in Marû*v* <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[4](#fn_1164) the brilliant, *and* some have said in
Pârs. 22. ‘For the support of the countries of Iran is the innumerable
army of the east; its having exalted banners <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[5](#fn_1165), is that they have a banner of tiger
skin (bôpar pôst), and their wind banner is white cotton <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[6](#fn_1166); innumerable are the mounted troops,
and they ride up to the *lurking*-holes <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[7](#fn_1167) of the demons; they will slay so that
a thousand women can afterwards see and kiss *but* one man.

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

23\. ‘When it is the end of the time <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1](#fn_1168), O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! those
enemies will be as much destroyed as the root of a shrub when *it is* in
the night on which a cold winter arrives, and in this night it sheds
*its* leaves; and they *will* reinstate these countries of Iran which I,
Aûharmazd, created <span id="fr_1176"></span>[2](#fn_1169).

24\. ‘And with speed rushes the evil spirit, with the vilest races of
demons and Wrath with infuriate spear <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[3](#fn_1170), *and* comes on to the support and
assistance of those demon-worshippers and miscreations of wrath, O
Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! 25. And I, the creator Aûharmazd, send
Nêryôsang the angel and Srôsh the righteous <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[4](#fn_1171) unto Kangde*z* <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[5](#fn_1172), which the illustrious
Sîyâvakhsh <span id="fr_1180"></span>[6](#fn_1173) formed, *and
to* *K*îtrô-mîyân <span id="fr_1181"></span>[7](#fn_1174) *son* of
Vi*s*tâsp, the glory of the Kayâns, the just restorer of the religion,
*to speak* thus: "Walk forth, O illustrious Pêshyôtanû! to these
countries of Iran which I, Aûharmazd, created; consecrate the fire and
waters for the Hâ*d*ôkht <span id="fr_1182"></span>[8](#fn_1175) *and*
Dvâ*z*dah-hômâst!

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

that is, celebrate *them* with the fire *and* waters, and such *as* is
appointed about the fire and waters!"

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

26\. ‘And Nêryôsang proceeds, *with* Srôsh the righteous, from the good
*K*akâ*d*-i-Dâîtîk <span id="fr_1183"></span>[1](#fn_1176) to Kangde*z*,
which the illustrious Sîyâvakhsh formed, and cries out from it thus:
"Walk forth, O illustrious Pêshyôtanû! O *K*îtrô-mîyân son of Vi*s*tâsp,
glory of the Kayâns, just restorer of the religion! walk forth to these
countries of Iran which I, Aûharmazd, created! restore again the throne
of sovereignty of the religion!"

27\. ‘Those spirits move on, and they propitiate them; with holy-water
the illustrious Pêshyôtanû celebrates the Dvâ*z*dah-hômâst, with a
hundred and fifty righteous who are disciples of Pêshyôtanû, in black
marten fur, and they have garments as it were of the good spirit. 28.
They walk up with *the words*: "Hûmat, hûkht, hûvar*s*t <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[2](#fn_1177)" and consecrate

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

the fire of the waters; *with* the illustrious Hâ*d*ôkht they bless me,
Aûharmazd, with the archangels, and after that it demolishes one-third
of the opposition. 29. And the illustrious Pêshyôtanû walks forth, with
the hundred and fifty men who wear black marten fur, and they celebrate
the rituals (yasnân) of the Gadman-hômand ("glorious") fire, which they
call the Rôshanô-kerp ("luminous form") <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[1](#fn_1178), which is established at the appointed
place (dâtô-gâs), the triumphant ritual of the Frôbâ fire, Horvada*d*,
*and* Amerôda*d*, and the ceremonial (ya*z*i*s*n) with his priestly
co-operation; they arrange and pray over the *sacred* twigs; *and* the
ritual of Horvada*d* and Amerôda*d*, in the chapter of the code of
religious formulas (nîrangistân) <span id="fr_1186"></span>[2](#fn_1179)
demolishes three-thirds of the opposition. 30. Pêshyôtanû son of
Vi*s*tâsp walks forth, with the assistance of the Frôbâ *fire*, the fire
Gû*s*nâsp, and the fire Bûr*z*în-Mitrô <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[3](#fn_1180), to the great idol-temples, the abode
of *the demons* <span id="fr_1188"></span>[4](#fn_1181); and the wicked
evil spirit, Wrath with infuriate spear <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[5](#fn_1182), and all demons and fiends, evil races
and wizards, arrive at the deepest *abyss* of hell; *and* those
idol-temples are extirpated by the exertions of the illustrious
Pêshyôtanû.

31\. ‘And I, the creator Aûharmazd, come to Mount Hûkaîryâ*d* <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[6](#fn_1183) with the archangels, and I issue

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

orders to the archangels that they should speak to the angels of the
spiritual existences thus: "Proceed to the assistance of the illustrious
Pêshyôtanû!" 32. Mitrô of the vast cattle-pastures, Srôsh the vigorous,
Rashn the just, Vâhrâm <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1](#fn_1184) the
mighty, Â*s*tâ*d* the victorious, *and* the glory of the religion of the
Mazdayasnians, the stimulator of *religious* formulas (nîrang), the
arranger of the world, *proceed* <span id="fr_1192"></span>[2](#fn_1185)
to the assistance of the illustrious Pêshyôtanû, through the order of
which I, the creator, have just written <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[3](#fn_1186).

33\. ‘*Out* of the demons of gloomy race the evil spirit cries to Mitrô
of the vast cattle-pastures thus: "Stay above in truth <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[4](#fn_1187), thou Mitrô of the vast
cattle-pastures!"

34\. ‘And then Mitrô of the vast cattle-pastures cries thus: "of these
nine thousand years’ support, which during its beginning produced Dahâk
of evil religion, Frâsîyâ*v* of Tûr, *and* Alexander <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[5](#fn_1188) the Rûman, the period of one thousand
years of those leathern-belted demons with dishevelled hair is a more
than moderate reign to produce <span id="fr_1196"></span>[6](#fn_1189)."

35\. ‘The wicked evil spirit becomes confounded when he heard this;
Mitrô of the vast cattle-pastures will smite Wrath of the infuriate
spear with

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

stupefaction; *and* the wicked evil spirit flees, with the miscreations
and evil progeny he flees back to the darkest *recess* of hell. 36. And
Mitrô of the vast cattle-pastures cries to the illustrious Pêshyôtanû
thus: "Extirpate *and* utterly destroy the idol-temples, the abode of
the demons! proceed to these countries of Iran which I, Aûharmazd,
created! restore again the throne of sovereignty of the religion over
the wicked! when they see thee they will be terrified."

37\. ‘And the illustrious Pêshyôtanû advances, and the fire Frôbâ, the
fire Gû*s*nasp, and the triumphant fire Bûr*z*în-Mitrô will smite the
fiend of excessive strength; he will extirpate the idol-temples that are
the abode of demons; and they celebrate the ceremonial (ya*z*i*s*n),
arrange the *sacred* twigs, solemnize the Dvâ*z*dah-hômâst, and praise
me, Aûharmazd, with the archangels; this is what I foretell <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1](#fn_1190). 38. The illustrious Pêshyôtanû walks
forth to these countries of Iran which I, Aûharmazd, created, to the
Arvand and Vêh river <span id="fr_1198"></span>[2](#fn_1191); when the
wicked see him they will be terrified, those of the progeny of gloom and
those not worthy.

39\. 'And regarding that Vâhrâm the Var*g*âvand it is declared that he
comes forth in full glory, fixes upon Vandî*d*-khîm <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[3](#fn_1192) ("a curbed temper"), and *having*
intrusted *him* with the seat of mobadship of the

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

mobads <span id="fr_1200"></span>[1](#fn_1193), and the seat of true
explanation of the religion, he restores again these countries of Iran
which I, Aûharmazd, created; and he drives <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[2](#fn_1194) away from the world covetousness,
want, hatred, wrath, lust, envy, and wickedness. 40. And the wolf period
goes away, and the sheep period comes on; they establish the fire Frôbâ,
the fire Gû*s*nâsp, *and* the fire Bûr*z*în-Mitrô again at their proper
places, and they will properly supply the firewood and incense; and the
wicked evil spirit becomes confounded and unconscious, with the demons
and the progeny of gloom. 41. And so the illustrious Pêshyôtanû speaks
thus: "Let the demon be destroyed, and the witch be destroyed! let the
fiendishness and vileness of the demons be destroyed! and let the gloomy
progeny of the demons be destroyed! The glory <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[3](#fn_1195) of the religion of the Mazdayasnians
prospers, and let it prosper! let the family <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[4](#fn_1196) of the liberal and just, who are doers
of good deeds, prosper! and let the throne of the religion and
sovereignty have a good restorer!" 42. Forth comes the illustrious
Pêshyôtanû, forth he comes with a hundred and fifty men of the disciples
who wear black marten fur, and they take the throne of their own
religion and sovereignty.'

43\. Aûharmazd said to Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân: ‘This is what I
foretell, when it is the end of thy millennium it is the beginning of
*that* of Hûshê*d*ar <span id="fr_1204"></span>[5](#fn_1197).

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 44. Regarding
Hûshê*d*ar it is declared that he will be born in 1600 <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1](#fn_1198), and at thirty years of age he comes
to a conference with me, Aûharmazd, *and* receives the religion. 45.
When he comes away from the conference he cries to the sun with the
swift horse <span id="fr_1206"></span>[2](#fn_1199), thus: "Stand
still!"

46\. ‘The sun with the swift horse stands still ten

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

days and nights; and when this happens all the people of the world abide
by the good religion of the Mazdayasnians. 47. Mitrô of the vast
cattle-pastures cries to Hûshê*d*ar, *son* of Zaratû*s*t, thus: "O
Hûshê*d*ar, restorer of the true religion! cry to the sun with the swift
horse thus: 'Move on!' for it is dark in the regions of Arzâh and Savâh,
Frada*d*afsh *and* Vîda*d*afsh, Vôrûbar*s*t *and* Vôrû*g*ar*s*t, and the
illustrious Khvanîras <span id="fr_1207"></span>[1](#fn_1200)."

48\. 'Hûshê*d*ar *son* of Zaratû*s*t cries, to the sun he cries, thus:
"Move on!" 49. The sun with the swift horse moves on, *and*
Var*g*âvand <span id="fr_1208"></span>[2](#fn_1201) and all mankind
fully believe in the good religion of the Mazdayasnians.'

50\. Aûharmazd spoke thus: ‘O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân! this is what I
foretell, that this one brings the creatures back to their proper state.
51. When it is near the end of the millennium Pêshyôtanû <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[3](#fn_1202) son of Vi*s*tâsp comes into notice,
who is a Kayân that advances triumphantly; and those enemies who relied
upon fiendishness, such as the Tûrk, Arab, and Rûman, and the vile ones
who control <span id="fr_1210"></span>[4](#fn_1203) the Iranian
sovereign with insolence and oppression and enmity to the sovereignty,
destroy the fire and make the religion weak; and they convey *their*
power and success to him and every one who accepts the law and religion
willingly; if he

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

accept it unwillingly the law and religion ever destroy *him* <span
id="fr_1211"></span>[1](#fn_1204) till it is the end of the whole
millennium.

52\. ‘And, afterwards, when the millennium of Hûshê*d*ar-mâh comes,
through Hûshê*d*ar-mâh <span id="fr_1212"></span>[2](#fn_1205) the
creatures become more progressive, and he utterly destroys the fiend of
serpent origin <span id="fr_1213"></span>[3](#fn_1206); *and* Pêshyôtanû
son of Vi*s*tâsp becomes, in like manner, high-priest and primate
(ra*d*) of the world <span id="fr_1214"></span>[4](#fn_1207). 53. In
that millennium of Hûshê*d*ar-mâh mankind become so versed in medicine,
and keep and bring physic and remedies so *much* in use, *that* when
they are confessedly at the point of death they do not thereupon die,
nor when they smite and slay *them* with the sword and knife <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[5](#fn_1208).

54\. ‘Afterwards, *one* begs a gift of *any* description out of the
allowance of heretics, *and* owing to depravity *and* heresy they do not
give *it*. 55. And Aharman rises through that spite <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[6](#fn_1209) on to the mountain

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

of Dimâvand <span id="fr_1217"></span>[1](#fn_1210), which is the
direction of Bêvarâsp, *and* shouts thus: "Now it is nine thousand
years, *and* Frê*d*ûn is not living; why do you not rise up, although
these thy fetters are not removed, when <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[2](#fn_1211) this world is full of people, and they
have brought them from the enclosure which Yim formed <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[3](#fn_1212)?"

56\. ‘After that apostate shouts like this, *and* because of it, A*z*-i
Dahâk <span id="fr_1220"></span>[4](#fn_1213) stands up before *him,
but,* through fear of the likeness of Frê*d*ûn in the body of Frê*d*ûn,
he does not first remove those fetters and stake from *his* trunk until
Aharman removes *them*. 57. And the vigour of A*z*-i Dahâk increases,
the fetters being removed from *his* trunk, *and his* impetuosity
remains; he swallows down the apostate on the spot <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[5](#fn_1214), and rushing into the world to
perpetrate sin, he commits innumerable grievous sins; he swallows down
one-third of mankind, cattle, sheep, and other creatures of Aûharmazd;
he smites the water, fire, and vegetation, and commits grievous sin.

58\. ‘And, afterwards, the water, fire, and vegetation stand before
Aûharmazd the lord in lamentation, and make this complaint: "Make
Frê*d*ûn alive again! so that he may destroy A*z*-i Dahâk; for if thou,
O Aûharmazd! dost not do this, we cannot

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

exist in the world; the fire says thus: I *will* not heat; and the water
says thus: I *will* not flow."

59\. ‘And then I, Aûharmazd the creator, say to Srôsh and Nêryôsang the
angel: "Shake the body of Keresâsp the Sâmân, till he rises up!"

60\. 'Then Srôsh and Nêryôsang the angel go to Keresâsp <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[1](#fn_1215); three times they utter a cry, and the
fourth time Sâm rises up with triumph, and goes to meet A*z*-i Dahâk.
61. And <span id="fr_1223"></span>[2](#fn_1216) Sâm does not listen to
his words, and the triumphant club strikes him on the head, and smites
and kills *him*; afterwards, desolation *and* adversity depart from this
world, while I make a beginning of the millennium <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[3](#fn_1217). 62. Then Sôshyans <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[4](#fn_1218) makes the creatures again pure, and
the resurrection and future existence occur.'

63\. May the end be in peace, pleasure, and joy, by the will of God
(yazdânŏ)! so may it be! even more so may it be!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1119"></span>[215:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1126) The Pâz. MSS.
insert, 'and black clothing' here.

<span id="fn_1120"></span>[215:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1127) Literally,
'black-marked,' or possibly, 'black standard.'

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[215:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1128) The Pâz. MSS.
add, 'the leathern-belted Tûrks,' that is, people of Turkistân.

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[215:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1129) This fiend
appears to be a personification of Christianity or 'ecclesiasticism'
(Kilisyâkîh, see Chap. II, 19), and the writer seems to place his
appearance some time in the middle ages, probably before the end of the
thirteenth century (see the note on § 44). Darmesteter suggests that
Shê*d*âsp may have been intended as a modern counterpart of Bêvarâsp
(A*z*-i Dahâk), the ancient tyrant; and that this Christian invasion may
be a reminiscence of the crusades.

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[215:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1130) I have formerly
read Mûsulmân instead of min Salmân, and hence concluded that the text
must have been written long <span id="page_216">p. 216</span> after the
Muhammadan conquest of Persia; but this reading is irreconcilable with
the context. The position of Salmân (Av. Sairima) is defined by Bund.
XX, 12, which places the sources of the Tigris in that country.

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[216:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1131) The name. of a
commentator, or commentary, often quoted in the Pahlavi Vendidad, and
other texts. Mâhvand-dâ*d* is mentioned in the Pahlavi Yasna (see Sls.
I, 4).

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[216:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1132) The Pâz. MSS.
state that 'Mercury and Jupiter beat down the strength of Venus.'

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[216:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1133) Here written
Arang, Arand, or Arvad, but as it is Arvand in §§ 21, 38, that reading
seems preferable, the difference between the two names in Pahlavi being
merely a single stroke. The Arvand is the Tigris, and the Arang probably
the Araxes (see SZS. VI, 20, Bund. XX, 8)..

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[216:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1134) Literally, 'there
are *and* were *some* who said;' this phrase occurs several times in the
latter part of this text.

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[216:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1135) The Euphrates.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[216:6](sbe0559.htm#fr_1136) Or, 'of strict
reckoning,' reading sâkht amâr, but both reading and meaning are very
uncertain. As it stands in K26 it <span id="page_217">p. 217</span> may
be sâkht *g*umâl, 'extreme beauty,' or Sâkhtîmâr (the name of a place),
or this may stand for sâkht tîmâr, 'severe misfortune;' and other
readings are possible.

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[217:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1137) It is not quite
clear which party will turn the other back.

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[217:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1138) Literally,
'extender,' that is, one engaged in extending his own dominions.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[217:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1139) The remainder of
this § (except the verb 'remain') is Pâzand written in Persian
characters in K20.

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[217:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1140) Possibly the
Karmak of Chap. II, 49. In § 20 the Kur*d* and Karmân (or Karms) may
refer to the Tûrk and Karm of this §, so it is doubtful whether Tûrk or
Kurd is meant.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[217:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1141) Or, 'for the
encounter,' pavan ham-rasi*s*nîh.

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[217:6](sbe0559.htm#fr_1142) See Bund. XXXI,
25, XXXIV, 7. The letters are here joined together, so as to become
Kai-gâûs, and this form of the name is <span id="page_218">p. 218</span>
often read Kâhûs or Kahôs in Pâzand (see Mkh. VIII, 27, XXVII, 54, LVII,
21). The Pâz. MSS. omit § 9.

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[218:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1143) See Bund. XII,
32, 33.

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[218:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1144) See Bund. XXIV,
16.

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[218:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1145) Perhaps 'one' is
meant, as hanâ, 'this,' is sometimes substituted for aê, 'one,' both
being read *e* in Pâzand.

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[218:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1146) The reading of
this name is quite uncertain.

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[218:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1147) See Chap. II, 63.
The whole of the final clause of this section, about the fire Vi*s*nâsp,
is inserted parenthetically at this point in the Pahlavi text.

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[218:6](sbe0559.htm#fr_1148) Elsewhere called
Gû*s*nasp, Gû*s*nâsp, or Gû*s*asp (see SZS. VI, 22).

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[218:7](sbe0559.htm#fr_1149) The most obvious
reading of this word is mâhîk, 'fish,' which can hardly be reconciled
with the context. The view here taken is that the writer was translating
from an Avesta text, and met <span id="page_219">p. 219</span> with the
word *k*ithra, which means both pê*d*âk, 'clear,' and tôkhmak,
'originating,' but to express the latter meaning he used the synonym
mâyakîk, which can be written exactly like mâhîk. Owing to the involved
character of this section it is not very clear in English, but it is
still more obscure in the Pahlavi text, in which the whole of this
clause about the fire is inserted parenthetically after the first
mention of Pa*d*ashkhvârgar.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[219:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1150) This last clause
may be read several ways, and it is by no means easy to ascertain
clearly the chronological order of the events which are jumbled together
in this last chapter. But it would appear that Zaratû*s*t's millennium
was to end at a time when the religion was undisturbed, and just before
the incursion of the demons or idolators, the details of which have been
given in Chap. II, 22-III, 11, and which is the first event of
Hûshê*d*ar's millennium (see § 13). Now according to Bund. XXXIV, 7-9,
the interval from 'the coming of the religion,' in the reign of
Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp, to the end of the Sasanian monarchy was 90 + 112 + 30 +
12 + 14 + 14 + 284 + 460 =1016 years. If by 'the coming of the religion'
be meant the time when Zaratû*s*t received it, as he was then thirty
years old, he must have been born 1046 years before the end of the
Sasanian monarchy (A.D. 651), and the end of his millennium must have
been in A.D. 605, the sixteenth year of Khûsrô Parvîz, when the Sasanian
power was near its maximum, and only a score of years before it began
suddenly to collapse. This close coincidence indicates that the writer
of the Bahman Ya*s*t must have adopted the same incorrect chronology as
is found in the Bundahi*s*. If, however, 'the coming of the religion'
mean its acceptance by Vi*s*tâsp, which occurred in Zaratû*s*t's
fortieth or <span id="page_220">p. 220</span> forty-second year, his
birth must have been ten or twelve years earlier. and his millennium
must have ended A.D. 593-595. But according to the imperfect chronology
of Bund. XXXIV the tenth millennium of the world, that of Capricornus,
commenced with 'the coming of the religion,' and ended, therefore, in
A.D. 635, the fourth year of Yazdakar*d*, the last Sasanian king, when
the Muhammadans were just preparing for their first invasion; so the
millennium of Aquarius is very nearly coincident with that of
Hûshê*d*ar, and may probably be intended to represent it. It appears,
therefore, that the millennium of Hûshê*d*ar is altogether past, having
extended from A.D. 593-635 to A.D. 1593-1635.

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[220:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1151) The Paz. MSS.
omit § 12. The writer having detailed the evils of the iron age, now
returns to its commencement in order to describe the means adopted for
partially counteracting those evils.

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[220:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1152) See Bund. XXII,
5, XXXII, 8. The Pâz. MSS. add, 'they bring him up in Zâvulistân and
Kâvulistân;' and the Pers. version says, 'on the frontier of
Kâbulistân.' With regard to the time of Hûshê*d*ar's birth, see § 44.
His name is always written Khûrshê*d*ar in K20.

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[220:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1153) The Pâz. and
Pers. versions say, 'at thirty years of age,' as in § 44.

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[220:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1154) Possibly
Samarkand (see Chap. II, 49. note 2).

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[221:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1155) Bahrâm the
illustrious or splendid (Av. vare*k*anghan*d*, compare Pers. var*g*), an
epithet applied, in the Avesta, to the moon, Ti*s*trya, the scriptures,
the royal glory of the Kayânians, the Kayânians themselves, and the hero
Thrita. This personage may possibly be an incarnation of the angel
Bahrâm, mingled with some reminiscences of the celebrated Persian
general Bahrâm *K*ôpîn; but see §§ 32, 49.

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[221:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1156) A commentator who
is quoted in the Pahlavi Yas. XI, 22; see also Chap. I, 7.

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[221:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1157) The 22nd day of
the eighth month of the Parsi year, corresponding to October 7th when
the year began at the vernal equinox, as the Bundahi*s* (XXV, 6, 7, 20,
21) describes.

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[221:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1158) That is, Bactrian
and Samarkandian.

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[221:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1159) Or, 'light up
with glitter,' according as we read tâ*g*end or tâ*v*end. The Pâz. MSS.
omit §§ 17-44, except one or two isolated phrases.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[221:6](sbe0559.htm#fr_1160) Spiegel was
inclined to identify this name with Bombay, but this is impossible, as
the MS. K20 (in which the name occurs) was written some two centuries
before the Portuguese invented the name of Bombay. Its original name, by
which it is still called by <span id="page_222">p. 222</span> its native
inhabitants, being Mumbaî. The locality mentioned in the text is,
evidently to be sought on the banks of the Oxus near Bukhârâ; the Oxus
having been sometimes considered the upper course of the Arag, and
sometimes that of the Veh (see Bund. XX, 22, note 5). It is hardly
probable that either Bâmî (Balkh) or Bâmiyân would be changed into
Bambŏ, and the only exact representative of this name appears to be
Bamm, a town about 120 miles S. E. of Kirmân; this is quite a different
locality from that mentioned in the text, but it is hazardous to set
bounds to the want of geographical knowledge displayed by some of the
Pahlavi commentators.

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[222:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1161) Compare SZS. IV,
8. Here the triumph of Jupiter over Venus appears to be symbolical of
the displacement of the queen dowager by her son.

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[222:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1162) That is, from the
southern shore of the Caspian.

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[222:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1163) Reading Hiriyân,
but this is doubtful, as it may be 'from the citadels (arigânŏ), or
defiles (khalakânŏ), of Kôhistân.'

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[222:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1164) See Bund. XII,
17, XIII, 15.

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[222:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1165) That is, every
man able to bear arms.

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[222:6](sbe0559.htm#fr_1166) Reading pavan,
'into,' instead of barâ, 'besides' (see SZS. VIII, 2, note 5).

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[222:7](sbe0559.htm#fr_1167) See § 10, but as
nothing is said there about Kur*d* or Karmân, it is possible that the
writer meant to say, 'of whom I told thee, <span id="page_223">p.
223</span> and whom they call both Kur*d* and Karmân.' It is more
probable, however, that he is referring to § 7.

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[223:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1168) Compare § 7. The
'extensive army' and 'two-legged wolf' are terms borrowed apparently
from Yas. IX, 62, 63.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[223:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1169) That is, 'the
rapid' (Av. aurvan*d*). The other names of this river, Tigris and
Hiddekel, have the same meaning. See §§ 5, 38.

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[223:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1170) See § 9, of which
this is a recapitulation, but the first of the three battles is here
omitted by mistake.

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[223:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1171) Marv in the
present Turkistân.

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[223:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1172) Referring to §
17.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[223:6](sbe0559.htm#fr_1173) Supposing that
bandôk may be equivalent to Pers. bandak, but the usual Pahlavi term for
cotton is pumbak (Pers. punbah).

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[223:7](sbe0559.htm#fr_1174) Reading grestak
as in § 5, but the word can also be read dar dî*d*ak, 'gate
watch-tower.' It is possible that the dru*g*ŏ geredha, 'pit of the
fiend,' of Vend. III, 24, may be here meant; the gate of hell, whence
the demons congregate upon the Are*z*ûr ridge (Bund. XII, 8).

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[224:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1175) Compare, 'and at
the time of the end' (Dan. xi. 40). The writer appears to be here
finally passing from a description of the past into speculations as to
the future, which he has hitherto only casually indulged in.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[224:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1176) The supernatural
means supposed to be employed for the destruction of the wicked and the
restoration of the good are detailed in the following paragraphs.

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[224:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1177) See Chap. II, 36.

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[224:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1178) The two angels
who are the special messengers of Aûharmazd to mankind (see Bund. XV, 1,
XXX, 29). This message was expected to be sent to Pêshyôtanû near the
end of Hûshê*d*ar's millennium (see § 51).

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[224:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1179) See Bund. XXIX,
10.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[224:6](sbe0559.htm#fr_1180) See Bund. XXXI,
25.

<span id="fn_1174"></span>[224:7](sbe0559.htm#fr_1181) A title of
Pêshyôtanû, written *K*itrô-maînô in Bund. XXIX, 5.

<span id="fn_1175"></span>[224:8](sbe0559.htm#fr_1182) This was the
twentieth nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature,
according to the Dînkar*d*; but the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d* and the Rivâyats
make it the twenty-first, and say very <span id="page_225">p. 225</span>
little about its contents (see Haug's Essays, pp. 133, 134). The
Dînkar*d*, in its eighth book, gives the following account of this
Nask:—

‘The Hâ*d*ôkht as it exists *has* three divisions among its 133
sections. The first *has* thirteen (twelve?) sections, treatises upon
the nature of the recital of the Ahunavar, which is the spiritual
benefit from chanting it aloud, and whatever is on the same subject.
Admonition about selecting *and* keeping a spiritual and worldly
high-priest, performing every duty as to the high-priest, *and*
maintaining even those of various high-priests. On the twenty-one
chieftainships of the spirits in Aûharmazd, and of the worldly
existences in Zaratû*s*t, among which are the worship of God *and* the
management of the devout. On the duty *requisite* in each of the five
different periods of the day and night, and *the fate at* the
*celestial* bridge of him who shall be zealous in the celebration of the
season-festivals; he who does not provide the preparations for the feast
of the season-festivals, and who is yet efficient in the other worship
of God. On how to consider, *and* what to do with, a leader of the
high-priest class and a man of the *inferior* classes; he who atones for
unimportant sin, and he who does not atone even for *that which* is
important, *and* whatever is on the same subject. On the apparatus with
which ploughed land (?) is prepared. On the manifestation of virtuous
manhood, and the merit and advantage from uttering good words *for
blessing* the eating and drinking of food and drink, and rebuking the
inward talk of the demons. On the recitations at the five periods of the
day, and the ceremonial invocation by name of many angels, each
separately, *and* great information on the same subject; the worthiness
of a man restrained by authority the giving of life and body to the
angel the good rulers, and their examination and satisfaction; the
blessing and winning words which are most successful in carrying off the
affliction which *proceeds* from a fiend. On all-pleasing creativeness
and omniscience, and all precedence (?), leadership, foresight(?),
worthy liberality, virtue (?), and every proper cause and effect of
righteousness; the individuality of righteousness, the opposition to the
demons of Aûharmazd's opinion, and also much other information in the
same section.

‘The middle *division has* 102 sections, treatises on spiritual and
worldly diligence, the leadership of the diligent, and their mighty
<span id="page_226">p. 226</span> means, all former deeds of
righteousness; righteousness kindling the resolution is the reward of
merit, each for each, and is adapted by it for that *of* which it is
said that *it is* the Hâ*d*ôkht which is the maintaining of
righteousness, so that they may make righteousness more abiding in the
body of a man.

'The last *division has* nineteen sections of trusty remedies, that is,
remedies whose utterance aloud by the faithful is a chief resource among
the creatures of God; also the nature of sayings full of humility,
well-favoured, most select, *and* adapted for that *of* which it is said
that I reverence that chief, the excellent and eminent Hâ*d*ôkht, of
which they trust in the sustaining strength of every word of Zaratû*s*t.
Perfect is the excellence of righteousness (Av. ashem vohû vahi*s*tem
astî).'

According to tradition three chapters of this Nask are still extant,
being the Ya*s*t fragments XXI, XXII of Westergaard's edition of the
Avesta Texts; but they do not correspond to any part of the description
in the Dînkar*d*. For a description of Dvâzdah-hômâst see Chap. II, 59.

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[226:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1183) See Bund. XII, 7.

<span id="fn_1177"></span>[226:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1184) That is, 'good
thoughts, good words, and good deeds,' a formula often uttered when
commencing an important action.

<span id="fn_1178"></span>[227:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1185) See Bund. XVII,
5, 6. This appears to be an allusion to the removal of the sacred fire
by Vi*s*tâsp, from the, 'glorious' mountain in Khvâri*z*em to the
'shining' mountain in Kâvulistân.

<span id="fn_1179"></span>[227:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1186) See Chap. II, 37.

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[227:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1187) Regarding these
three manifestations of the sacred fire, see Bund. XVII, 3-9, SZS. XI,
8-10.

<span id="fn_1181"></span>[227:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1188) Supplying the
word *s*êdâân, 'the demons,' in accordance with 36, 37; there being
clearly some word omitted in K20.

<span id="fn_1182"></span>[227:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1189) See Chap. II, 36.

<span id="fn_1183"></span>[227:6](sbe0559.htm#fr_1190) Hûgar the lofty
in Bund. XII, 2, 5.

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[228:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1191) The fact that the
angel Vâhrâm goes in his spiritual forth to the assistance of
Pêshyôtanû, rather militates against the idea that be also goes in the
form of Vâhrâm the Var*g*âvand.

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[228:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1192) This verb is
omitted by mistake in K20.

<span id="fn_1186"></span>[228:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1193) Literally,
'arrive at the writing.'

<span id="fn_1187"></span>[228:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1194) Or, 'stand up
with honesty.'

<span id="fn_1188"></span>[228:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1195) The latter two
names are here written Frâsâ*v* and Alasandar.

<span id="fn_1189"></span>[228:6](sbe0559.htm#fr_1196) From this it
appears that the writer expected the evil reign of the unbelievers to
last a thousand years, that is, till the end of Hûshê*d*ar's millennium,
about A.D. 1593-1635, which corresponds very closely with the reign of
the great Shâh ’Abbâs.

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[229:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1197) Or, perhaps 'what
I said before,' being already narrated in § 29 as performed by
Pêshyôtanû before advancing far into Iran.

<span id="fn_1191"></span>[229:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1198) The Tigris and
the Oxus-Indus (see §§ 5, 21).

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[229:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1199) Probably a title
of Pêshyôtanû; a more obvious translation would be, 'restrains a curbed
temper, and is intrusted,' &c,, but it is hardly probable that the
warrior prince Vâhrâm could become a priest. It is Vâhrâm's business to
restore the empire, leaving Pêshyôtanû to restore the religion.

<span id="fn_1193"></span>[230:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1200) The supreme
high-priesthood, or primacy.

<span id="fn_1194"></span>[230:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1201) Merely a guess,
as the verb varafsê*d* is difficult to understand.

<span id="fn_1195"></span>[230:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1202) K20 has nismô,
'soul,' but the very similarly written gadman, 'glory,' is a more likely
reading here (see § 32).

<span id="fn_1196"></span>[230:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1203) Reading dû*d*ak
instead of rû*d*ak, as in Chap. II, 47.

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[230:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1204) The writer having
detailed the supernatural means employed for restoring the religion, now
returns to the birth of Hûshê*d*ar <span id="page_231">p. 231</span> (§
13) for the purpose of mentioning some of his actions, and making the
chronology of his millennium rather more clear. Nothing is said here
about his miraculous birth, the details of which are given in the
seventh book of the Dînkar*d* very much as they are found in the Persian
Rivâyats. The Dînkar*d* states that thirty years before the end of
Zaratû*s*t's millennium a young maiden bathing in certain water, and
drinking it, becomes pregnant through the long-preserved seed of
Zaratû*s*t (see Bund. XXXII, 8, 9), and subsequently gives birth to
Hûshê*d*ar.

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[231:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1205) There seems to be
no other rational way of understanding this number than by supposing
that it represents the date of Hûshê*d*ar's birth, counting from the
beginning of Zaratû*s*t's millennium. According to this view Hûshê*d*ar
was to be born in the six hundredth year of his own millennium, and not
at its beginning, as § 13 seems to imply, nor nearly thirty years
earlier, as the Dînkar*d* asserts. As the beginning of his millennium
may be fixed about A.D. 593-635 (see note on § 11), the writer must have
expected him to be born about A.D. 1193-1235; a time which was probably
far in the future when he was writing. And as Vâhrâm the Var*g*âvand was
to be born when Hûshê*d*ar was thirty years of age (compare §§ 14) 44),
and was to march into Iran at the age of thirty (§ 17), the great
conflict of the nations (§§ 8, 19-22) was expected to begin about A.D.
1253-1295, and to continue till near the end of the millennium, about
A.D. 1593-1635, when Pêshyôtanû was expected to appear (§ 51) and to
restore the 'good' religion (§§ 26, 37, 42). An enthusiastic Parsi
interpreter of prophecy might urge that though this period did not
witness any revival of his religion, it did witness a restoration of the
Persian empire under Shâh ’Abbâs, and also the first beginning of
British power in India, which has been so great a benefit to the scanty,
remnant of his fellow-countrymen.

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[231:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1206) The usual epithet
of the sun in the Avesta.

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[232:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1207) The seven regions
of the earth (see Bund. XI, 2, 3).

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[232:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1208) It is just
possible to read, 'the sun with the swift horse, the splendid, moves on,
and all mankind fully believe,' &c. But if the reading in the text be
correct it effectually disposes of the idea of Vâhrâm being an
incarnation of the angel, as an angel would require no miracle to make
him believe in the religion.

<span id="fn_1202"></span>[232:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1209) See §§ 25-30.

<span id="fn_1203"></span>[232:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1210) This verb is
doubtful, as most of the word is torn off in K20.

<span id="fn_1204"></span>[233:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1211) This appears to
be the meaning, but the latter part of the sentence is not very clear.

<span id="fn_1205"></span>[233:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1212) See Bund. XXXII,
8. The name is written Khûrshê*d*-mâh in K20. The Dînkar*d* gives the
same account of the miraculous birth of Hûshê*d*ar-mâh as of the first
Hûshê*d*ar (see note on § 43); it also repeats the legend of the sun
standing still, but for the longer period of twenty days; all which
details are also found in the Persian Rivâyats.

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[233:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1213) Av.
a*z*i*k*ithra; such creatures are mentioned in Ar*d*avahi*s*t Yt. 8, 10,
11, 15; but A*z*-i Dahâk, 'the destructive serpent,' is probably meant
here (see §§ 56-61).

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[233:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1214) As in the
previous millennium. According to the chronology deduced from § 44 the
millennium of Hûshê*d*ar-mâh, which corresponds to the twelfth and last
millennium of Bund. XXXIV, is now near the middle of its third century.

<span id="fn_1208"></span>[233:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1215) The sentence is
either defective or obscure, but this appears to be its meaning.

<span id="fn_1209"></span>[233:6](sbe0559.htm#fr_1216) The evil spirit
is encouraged by an act of religious toleration, apparently, to
recommence his manœuvres for injuring mankind.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[234:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1217) Here written
Dimbhâvand (see Bund. XII, 31).

<span id="fn_1211"></span>[234:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1218) Reading amat,
'when,' instead of mûn, 'which' (see the note on Bund. I, 7).

<span id="fn_1212"></span>[234:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1219) The var-i Yim
kar*d* (see Bund. XXIX, 14). The men and creatures who are supposed to
be preserved in this enclosure are expected to replenish the world
whenever it has been desolated by wars and oppression.

<span id="fn_1213"></span>[234:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1220) Whose surname is
Bêvarâsp (see Bund. XXIX, 9).

<span id="fn_1214"></span>[234:5](sbe0559.htm#fr_1221) The Pâz. MSS. end
here.

<span id="fn_1215"></span>[235:1](sbe0559.htm#fr_1222) Also called Sâm
in this same section; he was lying in a trance in the plain of
Pê*s*yânsaî (see Bund. XXIX, 7-9).

<span id="fn_1216"></span>[235:2](sbe0559.htm#fr_1223) Reading afa*s*
instead of mina*s* (see Chap. II, 4, note 2).

<span id="fn_1217"></span>[235:3](sbe0559.htm#fr_1224) The thirteenth
millennium, or first of the future existence, when Sôshyans appears. The
Dînkar*d* and the Persian Rivâyats recount the same legends regarding
the miraculous birth of Sôshyans, and of the sun standing still (for
thirty days), as they do with regard to Hûshê*d*ar (see note on § 43).

<span id="fn_1218"></span>[235:4](sbe0559.htm#fr_1225) See Bund. XXXII,
8.
