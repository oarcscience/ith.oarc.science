<p>[1. On the evil-doing of Aharman <I>and</I> the demons it says in revelation, that the evil which the evil spirit has produced for the creation of A&ucirc;harmazd it is possible to tell by this winter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; and his body is that of a lizard (vazagh)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> <I>whose</I> place is filth (kal<I>k</I>). 2. He does not think, nor speak, nor act <I>for</I> the welfare (nad&ucirc;k&icirc;h) of the creatures of A&ucirc;harmazd; and his business is unmercifulness and the destruction of this <I>welfare</I>, so that the creatures which A&ucirc;harmazd shall increase he will destroy; and <I>his</I> eyesight (<I>k</I>ashm m&icirc;<I>k</I>i<I>s</I>n)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_584"></A><A HREF="#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> does not refrain from doing the creatures harm. 3.

<p>since a creature was created by, us, I, who am A&ucirc;harmazd, have not rested at ease, on account of providing protection for my own creatures; and likewise not even he, the evil spirit, on account of contriving evil for the creatures.' 4. And by <I>their</I> devotion to witchcraft (y&acirc;t&ucirc;k-d&icirc;n&ocirc;&icirc;h) he seduces mankind into affection for himself and disaffection to A&ucirc;harmazd&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="#fn_580"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, so that they forsake the religion of A&ucirc;harmazd, and practise that of Aharman. 5. He casts this into the thoughts of men, that this religion of A&ucirc;harmazd is nought, and it is not necessary to be steadfast in it. 6. Whoever gives that man anything, in whose law (d&acirc;<I>d</I>) this saying is established, then the evil spirit is propitiated by him, that is, he has acted by his pleasure.</p>  
<p>7. The business of Ak&ocirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_581"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is this, that he gave vile thoughts and discord to the creatures. 8. The business of the demon Andar is this, that he constrains the thoughts of the creatures from deeds of virtue, just like a leader who <I>has</I> well-constrained (sard&acirc;r-i kh&ucirc;p afs&acirc;r<I>d</I>&#335;); <I>and</I> he casts this into the thoughts of men, that it is not necessary to have the <I>sacred</I> shirt <I>and thread</I>-girdle. 9. The business of the demon S&acirc;var&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that is a leader of the demons, is this, that is, misgovernment, oppressive anarchy, and drunkenness. 10. The business of the demon N&acirc;&icirc;k&icirc;yas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is this, that he gives discontent to the creatures; as it says, that should this <I>one</I></p>

The demon Tapr&ecirc;<I>v</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is he who mingles poison with plants and creatures; as it says thus: 'Tapr&ecirc;<I>v</I> the frustrater, <I>and</I> Z&acirc;&icirc;r&icirc;<I>k</I> the maker of poison.' 12. All those six, it is said, are arch-fiends&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of the demons; the rest are cooperating and confederate with them. 13. This, too, it says, that]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> should <I>one</I> give [anything to] a man who says [that it is proper to have one boot], and in his law walking with one boot [is established, then]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the fiend Tapr&ecirc;<I>v</I> is propitiated [by him].</p>

There where M&icirc;t&ocirc;kht ('falsehood') arrives, Ara<I>s</I>k ('malice') becomes welcome, [and there where Ara<I>s</I>k is welcome]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_601"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Aeshm lays a foundation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_602"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and there where Aeshm has a foundation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> many creatures perish, <I>and</I> he causes much non-Iranianism&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_604"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. 17. Aeshm mostly contrives all evil for the creatures of A&ucirc;harmazd, <I>and</I> the evil deeds of those Kay&acirc;n heroes have been more complete through Aeshm, as it says, that Aeshm, the impetuous assailant, causes them most&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_605"></A><A HREF="#fn_600"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.</p>

The demon Uda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is he who, when a man sits in a private place, or when he eats at meals, strikes <I>his</I> knee spiritually on <I>his</I> back&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_604"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, so that he bawls out [<I>and</I> looks out, that chattering he may eat, chattering] he may evacuate (r&icirc;e<I>d</I>), and chattering he may make water (m&ecirc;z&ecirc;<I>d</I>), so that he may not attain [unto the] best existence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_610"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> .</p>  
<p>[20. The demon Ak&acirc;t&acirc;sh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_611"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is the fiend of perversion (nik&icirc;r&acirc;y&icirc;h), who makes the creatures averse (nik&icirc;r&acirc;&icirc;) from proper things; as it says, that whoever <I>has</I> given anything to that person (tan&ucirc;) whose opinion (d&acirc;<I>d</I>) is this, that it is not necessary to have a high-priest (dast&ocirc;bar), then the demon Aeshm is propitiated by him. 21. Whoever <I>has</I> given anything to that person whose opinion is this, <I>and</I> who says, that it is not necessary to have a snake-killer (m&acirc;r-van), then Aharman, with the foregoing demons, is propitiated by him; this is said of him who, when he sees a noxious creature, does not kill <I>it</I>. 22. A snake-killer (m&acirc;ro-gn&ocirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_612"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> is a stick on the end of which a leathern <I>thong</I> is</p>

<p>23. Zarm&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is the demon who makes decrepit (d&ucirc;spa<I>d</I>), whom they call old age (pir&icirc;h). 24. <I>K</I>&icirc;shmak&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_609"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is he who makes disastrous (vazandak), and also causes the whirlwind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_615"></A><A HREF="#fn_610"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> <I>which</I> passes over for disturbance. 25. The demon Varen&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_616"></A><A HREF="#fn_611"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is he who causes illicit intercourse, as it says thus: 'Varen&ocirc; the defiling (&acirc;l&acirc;&icirc;).' 26. The demon B&ucirc;sh&acirc;sp&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_617"></A><A HREF="#fn_612"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is she who causes slothfulness; S&ecirc;<I>g</I> is the fiend (dr&ucirc;<I>g</I>) who causes annihilation; and the demon N&icirc;y&acirc;z is he who <I>causes</I> distress.</p>  
<p>27. The demon &Acirc;z&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_618"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> ('greediness') is he who swallows everything, and when, through destitution, nothing has come he eats himself; he is that fiendishness which, although the whole wealth of the world be given up to it, does not fill up and is not satisfied; as it says, that the eye of the covetous is a noose (gamand), and <I>in</I> it the world is nought. 28. P&ucirc;<I>s</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_619"></A><A HREF="#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> is the demon who makes a hoard, <I>and</I></p>

<p>does not consume <I>it, and</I> does not give to any one; as it says, that the power of the demon &Acirc;z is owing to that person who, not content with his own wife, snatches away even those of others.</p>  
<p>29. The demon Nas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_620"></A><A HREF="#fn_615"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is he who causes the pollution and contamination (nisr&ucirc;<I>s</I>tih), which they call nas&acirc;i ('dead matter'). 30. The demon Fr&icirc;ft&acirc;r ('deceiver') is he who seduces mankind. 31. The demon Spazg&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_621"></A><A HREF="#fn_616"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> ('slander') is he who brings <I>and</I> conveys discourse (milay&acirc;), <I>and</I> it is nothing in appearance such <I>as</I> he says; and he shows that mankind fights <I>and</I> apologizes (avakhsh&icirc;n&ecirc;<I>d</I>), individual with individual. 32. The demon Ar&acirc;st&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_622"></A><A HREF="#fn_617"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> ('untrue') is he who speaks falsehood. 33. The demon A&icirc;gh&acirc;sh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_623"></A><A HREF="#fn_618"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is the malignant-eyed fiend who smites mankind with <I>his</I> eye. 24. The demon B&ucirc;t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_624"></A><A HREF="#fn_619"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is he whom they worship among the Hind&ucirc;s, and his growth is lodged in idols, as one worships the horse <I>as</I> an idol&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_625"></A><A HREF="#fn_620"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. 35 Ast&ocirc;-v&icirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_626"></A><A HREF="#fn_621"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> is the evil flyer (v&acirc;&ecirc;-i sar&icirc;tar) who seizes the life; as it says that, when</p>

<p><I>his</I> hand strokes a man <I>it is</I> lethargy, when he casts <I>it</I> on the sick <I>one it is</I> fever, when he looks in his eyes he drives away the life, and they call it death. 36. The demon of the malignant eye (s&ucirc;r-<I>k</I>ashm&icirc;h) is he who will spoil anything which men see, <I>when</I> they do not say 'in the name of God' (yazd&acirc;n).</p>  
<p>37. With every one of them are many demons <I>and</I> fiends co-operating, to specify whom a second time <I>would be</I> tedious; demons, too, who are furies (khashmak&acirc;n), are in great multitude it is said. 38. They are demons of ruin, pain, and growing old (zv&acirc;r&acirc;n), producers of vexation and bile, revivers of grief (n&icirc;vag&icirc;h), the progeny of gloom, and bringers of stench, decay, and vileness, who are many, very numerous, and very notorious; and a portion of all of them is mingled in the bodies of men, <I>and their</I> characteristics are glaring in mankind.</p>  
<p>39. The demon Ap&acirc;&ocirc;sh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_627"></A><A HREF="#fn_622"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the demon Aspen<I>g</I>arg&acirc;k&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_628"></A><A HREF="#fn_623"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are those who remain in contest with the rain. 40. Of the evil spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_629"></A><A HREF="#fn_624"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are the law of vileness, the religion of sorcery, the weapons of fiendishness, and the perversion (kh&acirc;m&icirc;h) of God's works; and</p>

This, too, it says, that the evil spirit remains at the distance of a cry, even at the cry of a three-year-old cock (k&ucirc;l&ecirc;ng), even at the cry of an ass, even at the cry of a righteous man when <I>one</I> strikes <I>him</I> involuntarily <I>and</I> he utters a cry&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_631"></A><A HREF="#fn_626"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 42. The demon K&ucirc;ndak&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_632"></A><A HREF="#fn_627"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is he who is, the steed (b&acirc;rak) of wizards.</p>  
<p>43. Various new demons <I>arise</I> from the various new sins the creatures may commit, <I>and</I> are produced for such <I>purposes</I>; who make even those planets rush <I>on</I> which are in the <I>celestial</I> sphere, <I>and</I> they stand very numerously in the conflict. 44. Their ringleaders (kam&acirc;r&icirc;k&acirc;n) are those seven <I>planets</I>, the head and tail of G&ocirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;har, and M&ucirc;<I>s</I>par&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_633"></A><A HREF="#fn_628"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p>provided with a tail, <I>which</I> are ten. 45. And by them these ten worldly creations, <I>that</I> is, the sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals, metals, wind, light, fire, and mankind, are corrupted with all this vileness; and from them calamity, captivity, disease, death, and other evils and corruptions ever come to water, vegetation, and the other creations which exist <I>in</I> the world, owing to the fiendishness of those ten. 46. They whom I <I>have</I> enumerated are <I>furnished</I> with the assistance and crafty (afzar-h&ocirc;mand) nature of Aharman.</p>  
<p>47. Regarding the cold, dry, stony, and dark interior of mysterious (t&acirc;r&icirc;k d&ecirc;n afr&acirc;<I>g</I>-p&ecirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;k) hell it says, that the darkness is fit to grasp with the hand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_634"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the stench is fit to cut with a knife; and if they inflict the punishment of a thousand men within a single span, they (the men) think in this <I>way</I>, that they are alone; <I>and</I> the loneliness is worse than its punishment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_635"></A><A HREF="#fn_630"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 48. And its connection (band) is with the seven planets, be it through much cold like Saturn&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_636"></A><A HREF="#fn_631"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (K&ecirc;v&acirc;n), be it through much heat like Aharman; and their food is brimstone (gandak), and of succulents the lizard (vazagh), <I>and</I> other evil <I>and</I> wretchedness (paty&acirc;n).]</p>
