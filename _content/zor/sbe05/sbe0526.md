### CHAPTER XVII.

1\. On the nature of fire it says in revelation, that fire is produced
of five kinds, namely, the fire Berezi-savang <span
id="fr_307"></span>[2](#fn_306), the fire which shoots up before
Aûharmazd the lord; the fire Vohu-fryãn <span
id="fr_308"></span>[3](#fn_307), the fire which is in the bodies of men
and animals; the fire Urvâzi*s*t <span id="fr_309"></span>[4](#fn_308),
the fire which is in plants; the fire

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vâzi*s*t <span
id="fr_310"></span>[1](#fn_309), the fire which is in a cloud *which*
stands opposed to Spên*g*argâk in conflict; the fire Spêni*s*t <span
id="fr_311"></span>[2](#fn_310), the fire which they keep in use in the
world, likewise the fire of Vâhrâm <span
id="fr_312"></span>[3](#fn_311). 2. Of those five fires one consumes
both water and food, as that which is in the bodies of men; one consumes
water *and* consumes no food, as that which is in plants, which live and
grow through water; one consumes food *and* consumes no water, as that
which they keep in use in the world, and likewise the fire of Vâhrâm;
one consumes no water and no food, as the fire Vâzi*s*t. 3. The
Berezi-savang is that in the earth and mountains *and* other things,
which <span id="fr_313"></span>[4](#fn_312) Aûharmazd created, *in* the
original creation, like three breathing souls (nismô); through the
watchfulness and protection *due* to them the world ever develops
(vakhshê*d*).

4\. And in the reign of Takhmôrup <span id="fr_314"></span>[5](#fn_313),
when men continually passed, on the back of the ox Sarsaok <span
id="fr_315"></span>[6](#fn_314), from Khvanîras to the other regions,
one night

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

amid the sea the wind rushed upon <span id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_315)
the fireplace—the fireplace in which the fire was, such as was provided
in three places on the back of the ox—which the wind dropped with the
fire into the sea; and all those three fires, like three breathing
souls, continually shot up in the place and position of the fire on the
back of the ox, so that it becomes quite light, *and* the men pass again
through the sea. 5. And in the reign of Yim <span
id="fr_317"></span>[2](#fn_316) every duty was performed more fully
through the assistance of all those three fires; and the fire
Frôbak <span id="fr_318"></span>[3](#fn_317) was established by him at
the appointed place (dâ*d*-gâs) on the Gadman-hômand ('glorious')
mountain in Khvâri*z*em <span id="fr_319"></span>[4](#fn_318), which Yim
constructed for them; and the glory of Yim saves the fire Frôbak from
the hand of Dahâk <span id="fr_320"></span>[5](#fn_319). 6. In the reign
of King Vi*s*tâsp, upon revelation from the religion <span
id="fr_321"></span>[6](#fn_320), it was established, out of Khvâri*z*em,
at the Rôshan ('shining') mountain in Kâvulistân, the country of Kâvul
(Kâbul), just as it remains there even now.

7\. The fire Gû*s*asp, until the reign of Kaî-Khûsrôb <span
id="fr_322"></span>[7](#fn_321) continually afforded the world
protection in the manner *aforesaid <span
id="fr_323"></span>[8](#fn_322); and* when Kaî-Khûsrôb <span
id="fr_324"></span>[7](#fn_321) was

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

extirpating the idol-temples of Lake *K*ê*k*ast <span
id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_323) it settled upon the mane of *his* horse,
and drove away the darkness and gloom, and made *it* quite light, so
that they might extirpate the idol-temples; in the same locality the
fire Gû*s*asp was established at the appointed place on the Asnavand
mountain <span id="fr_326"></span>[2](#fn_324).

8\. The fire Bûr*z*în-Mitrô, until the reign of King Vi*s*tâsp, ever
assisted <span id="fr_327"></span>[3](#fn_325), *in* like manner, in the
world, *and* continually afforded protection; *and* when the
glorified <span id="fr_328"></span>[4](#fn_326) Zaratû*s*t was
introduced to produce confidence in the progress of the religion, King
Vi*s*tâsp and *his* offspring were steadfast in the religion of
God. <span id="fr_329"></span>[5](#fn_327), *and* Vi*s*tâsp established
*this fire* at the appointed place on Mount Rêvand, where they say the
Ridge of Vi*s*tâsp (pû*s*t-i Vi*s*tâspân) is <span
id="fr_330"></span>[6](#fn_328).

9\. All those three fires are the whole body of the fire of Vâhrâm,
together with the fire of the world, and those breathing souls are
lodged in them; a counterpart of the body of man when it forms in the
womb of the mother, *and* a soul from the spirit-*world* settles within
*it*, which controls the body while living; when that body dies, the
body mingles with the earth, *and* the soul goes back to the spirit.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_306"></span>[61:2](sbe0526.htm#fr_307) These Avesta names
of the five kinds of fire are enumerated in Yas. XVII, 63-67, and the
Pahlavi translation of that passage interchanges the attributes ascribed
to the first and fifth in the text, thus it calls the first 'the fire of
sublime benefit in connection with Varahrân (Bahrâm).' See also
Selections of Zâ*d*-sparam, XI, 1.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[61:3](sbe0526.htm#fr_308) 'The fire of the
good diffuser (or offerer), that within the bodies of men' (Pahl. Yas.
XVII, 64).

<span id="fn_308"></span>[61:4](sbe0526.htm#fr_309) 'The fire of
prosperous (or abundant) life, that within plants' (Pahl. Yas. XVII,
65).

<span id="fn_309"></span>[62:1](sbe0526.htm#fr_310) 'The fire Vâzi*s*t,
that which smites the demon Spen*g*argâ' (Pahl. Yas. XVII, 66). See
Chap. VII, 12.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[62:2](sbe0526.htm#fr_311) 'The propitious fire
*which* stands in heaven before Aûharmazd in a spiritual state' (Pahl.
Yas. XVII, 67).

<span id="fn_311"></span>[62:3](sbe0526.htm#fr_312) The Bahrâm fire, or
sacred fire at places of worship.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[62:4](sbe0526.htm#fr_313) M6 has min, instead
of mûn, which alters the translation, but not the meaning. This appears
to be a different account of the fire Berezi-savang to that given in §
1, but it merely implies that it is fire in its spiritual state, and the
name can, therefore, be applied to any natural fire which can be
attributed to supernatural agency, such as burning springs of petroleum,
volcanic eruptions, ignis fatuus, phosphorescence of the sea, &c.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[62:5](sbe0526.htm#fr_314) The second
Pê*s*dâdian monarch (see Chaps. XXXI, 2, 3, XXXIV, 4).

<span id="fn_314"></span>[62:6](sbe0526.htm#fr_315) Written Srisaok in
the MSS. in Chap. XV, 27; where it also appears that the sea was 'the
wide-formed ocean.' See likewise Chap. XIX, 13.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[63:1](sbe0526.htm#fr_316) Compare staft with
Pers. *s*itâftan, 'to hasten.'

<span id="fn_316"></span>[63:2](sbe0526.htm#fr_317) The third
Pê*s*dâdian monarch (see Chaps. XXXI, 3, 4, XXXIV, 4).

<span id="fn_317"></span>[63:3](sbe0526.htm#fr_318) Also written Frôbŏ,
Frôbâ, Frôbâk, or Frôbâg.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[63:4](sbe0526.htm#fr_319) The Av. *Hv*âirizem
of Mihir Yt. 14, a province east of the Caspian.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[63:5](sbe0526.htm#fr_320) It is doubtful
whether va gadman, 'and the glory,' or nismô, 'the soul, reason' (see
Chaps. XXIII, 1, XXXIV, 4), should be read. And it may even be that 'the
fire Frôbak saves the soul of Yim,' &c. For Dahâk see Chaps. XXXI, 6,
XXXIV, 5.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[63:6](sbe0526.htm#fr_321) Or, I upon
declaration from revelation!

<span id="fn_321"></span>[63:7](sbe0526.htm#fr_324) Here written
Kai-Khûsrôbî.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[63:8](sbe0526.htm#fr_323) In § 3. The 'three
breathing souls' of spiritual fire are supposed <span id="page_64">p.
64</span> to be incorporated in its three earthly representatives, the
fires Frôbak, Gû*s*asp, and Bûr*z*în-Mitrô respectively.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[64:1](sbe0526.htm#fr_325) That is, of the
province around that lake (see Chap. XXII, 2).

<span id="fn_324"></span>[64:2](sbe0526.htm#fr_326) See Chap. XII, 26.
Compare Selections of Zâ*d*-sparam, VI, 22.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[64:3](sbe0526.htm#fr_327) Taking va*g*î*d* as
equivalent to Pers. guzîd; but it may be equivalent to Pers. vazîd,
'grew, shot up.'

<span id="fn_326"></span>[64:4](sbe0526.htm#fr_328) The epithet
anôshak-rûbân (Pers. nôshirvân) means literally 'immortal-souled.'

<span id="fn_327"></span>[64:5](sbe0526.htm#fr_329) Or, 'of the angels,'
which plural form is often used to express 'God.'

<span id="fn_328"></span>[64:6](sbe0526.htm#fr_330) See Chap. XII, 18,
34.
