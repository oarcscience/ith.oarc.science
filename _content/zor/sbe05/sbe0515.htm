The spirit of the sky is himself like one of the warriors who has put on armour; he arrayed the sky against the evil. spirit, and led on in the contest, until A&ucirc;harmazd had completed a rampart around, stronger than the sky and in front of the sky. 3. And his guardian spirits (frav&acirc;har) of warriors and the righteous, on war horses and spear in hand, were around the sky; such-like as the hair on the head is the similitude (&acirc;ngun&icirc;-a&icirc;tak) of those who hold the watch of the rampart. 4. And no passage was found by the evil spirit, who rushed back; and he beheld the annihilation of the demons and his own impotence, as A&ucirc;harmazd, <I>did</I> his own final triumph, producing the renovation <I>of the universe</I> for ever and everlasting.</p>
