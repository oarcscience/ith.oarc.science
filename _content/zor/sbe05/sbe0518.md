### CHAPTER IX.

1\. The conflict waged with plants was that when <span
id="fr_144"></span>[5](#fn_144) they became quite dry. 2. Amerôda*d* the
arch-angel,

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

as the vegetation was his own, pounded the plants small, *and* mixed
*them* up with the water *which* Tî*s*tar seized, and Tî*s*tar made that
water rain down upon the whole earth. 3. On the whole earth plants grew
up like hair upon the heads of men. 4. Ten thousand <span
id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145) of them grew forth of one special
description, for keeping away the ten thousand species of disease
*which* the evil spirit produced for the creatures; *and* from those ten
thousand, the 100,000 species <span id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_146) of
plants have grown forth.

5\. From that same germ of plants the tree of all germs <span
id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_147) was given forth, *and* grew up in the
wide-formed ocean, from which the germs of all species of plants ever
increased. 6. And near to that tree of all germs the Gôkar*d* tree <span
id="fr_148"></span>[4](#fn_148) was produced, for keeping away deformed
(dûspa*d*) decrepitude; *and* the full perfection of the world arose
therefrom.
