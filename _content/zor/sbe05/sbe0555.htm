<p>1. As he (Aharman) came seventhly to fire, which was all together <I>against</I> him, the fire <I>separated</I> into five kinds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1028"></A><A HREF="#fn_1021"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, which are called the Propitious, the Good diffuser, the A&ucirc;rv&acirc;z&icirc;<I>s</I>t, the V&acirc;z&icirc;<I>s</I>t, and the Supremely-<I>benefiting</I>. 2. And it produced the Propitious fire itself in heaven (gar&ocirc;<I>d</I>m&acirc;n); its manifestation is in the fire which is burning on the earth, and its propitiousness is this, that all the kinds are of its nature. 3. <I>The Good diffuser</I> is that which is in men and animals&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1029"></A><A HREF="#fn_1022"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and its business <I>consists</I> in the digestion of the food, the sleeping of the</p>

<p>body, <I>and</I> the brightening of the eyes. 4. The A&ucirc;rv&acirc;z&icirc;<I>s</I>t is that which is in plants, in whose seed <I>it</I> is formed, and its business <I>consists</I> in piercing the earth, warming the chilled water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1030"></A><A HREF="#fn_1023"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and producing the qualities and fragrance of plants and blossoms therefrom, and elaborating the ripened produce into many fruits. 5. And the V&acirc;z&icirc;<I>s</I>t is that which has its motion in a cloud, and its business <I>consists</I> in destroying the atmospheric gloom and darkness, and making the thickness of the atmosphere fine and propitious in quality, sifting the hail, moderately warming the water which the cloud holds, <I>and</I> making sultry weather showery. 6. The Supremely-benefiting, like the sky, is that glory whose lodgment is in the Behr&acirc;m fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1031"></A><A HREF="#fn_1024"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, as the master of the house is over the house, <I>and</I> whose propitious power <I>arises</I> from the growing brightness of the fire, the blazing forth in&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1032"></A><A HREF="#fn_1025"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the purity of the place, the praise of God (yazd&acirc;n&#335;), <I>and</I> the practice of good works. 7. And its business is <I>that</I> it struggles with the spiritual fiend, it watches the forms of the witches&#151;who walk up from the river&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1033"></A><A HREF="#fn_1026"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, wear woven clothing, disturb the luminaries by the concealment of stench, <I>and</I> by witchcraft injure the creatures&#151;and the occurrences of destruction, burning, and celebration of witchcraft, especially at night; being an assistant of Sr&ocirc;sh the righteous.</p>

<p>8. And in the beginning of the creation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1034"></A><A HREF="#fn_1027"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the whole earth was delivered over into the guardianship of the sublime Fr&ocirc;bak fire, the mighty G&ucirc;<I>s</I>nasp fire, and the beneficial B&ucirc;r<I>z</I>&icirc;n-Mitr&ocirc; fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1035"></A><A HREF="#fn_1028"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>which</I> are like priest, warrior, and husbandman. 9.

<p>The coming of the religion, beginning in the time of Fr&acirc;s&icirc;y&acirc;<I>v</I> and M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har, with an anecdote of K&acirc;&icirc;-&ucirc;s and the hero Sr&icirc;t&ocirc; (Av. Thrita). The manifestation of the glory of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t <A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A> before his birth. The begetting of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t through the drinking of h&ocirc;m-juice and cow's milk infused, respectively, with his guardian spirit and glory, as declared in the manuscript on 'the guidance of worship.' The connection of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t with A&ucirc;harmazd, traced back through his genealogy as far as G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>. The persistent endeavours of the fiends to destroy Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t at the time of his birth, and how they were frustrated. His receiving the religion from A&ucirc;harmazd, with another anecdote of K&acirc;&icirc;-&ucirc;s and Sr&icirc;t&ocirc;, and of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t's exclamation on coming into the world. The enmity borne to him by five brothers of the Karap&acirc;n family, and how it was frustrated; his own four brothers, and some of his wonderful deeds. The worthiness of his righteousness; his compassionate and liberal nature; his giving up worldly desires; his pity; his good selection of a wife; and what is most edifying for the soul. What occurred when he was thirty years old, and his being conducted by the archangel Voh&ucirc;man to the assembly of the spirits. The questions asked by Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, and A&ucirc;harmazd's replies thereto. The seven questions he asked of the seven archangels in seven different places, in the course of one winter. [Westergaard's MS. K35 ends in the middle of the second of these questions.] The five dispositions of priests, and the ten admonitions. The three preservatives of religion, with particulars about the G&acirc;thas and the connection of the Ahunavar with the Nasks. Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t's obtaining one disciple, M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h, in the first ten years, and the acceptance of the religion by Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp two years afterwards.</p>  
<p>The second of the writings of Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam consists of his 'sayings about the formation of men out of body, life, and soul;' and the third (which is imperfect in all known MSS.) contains his 'sayings about producing the renovation <I>of the universe</I>.'</P>
