### CHAPTER X.

1\. The rule <span id="fr_1576"></span>[4](#fn_1564) is this, that a
*sacred thread*-girdle (kûstîk) be three finger-*breadths loose*
transversely

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (pavan
targûn) <span id="fr_1577"></span>[1](#fn_1565), as is said in every
teaching (*k*âstak) <span id="fr_1578"></span>[2](#fn_1566), and when it
is less it is not proper.

2\. The rule is this, that the sacred cake (drôn), set aside at the
dedication *formula* (shnûmanê) *on the days devoted to* the guardian
spirits <span id="fr_1579"></span>[3](#fn_1567), is to be used at the
season-festivals, the Nônâbar <span id="fr_1580"></span>[4](#fn_1568),
the three *nights’ ceremony* <span id="fr_1581"></span>[5](#fn_1569),
the Hôm-drôn, and other *rites of* the righteous guardian spirits; and
when they shall not do *so*, according to some teachings, it is not
proper.

3\. In the exposition (*k*â*s*tak) of the Nihâ*d*ûm Nask <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[6](#fn_1570) it says that a man is going to commit
robbery,

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

*and* a wall falls in upon him, *it is* his destroyer; when a man
strikes at him *he is* his adversary, *and* both are in sinfulness; when
he is going to perform the worship of God (ya*z*i*s*nŏ-i yazdânŏ) both
of them are in innocence.

4\. The rule is this, that when a woman becomes pregnant, as long as it
is possible, the fire is to be maintained most carefully in the
dwelling, because it is declared in the Spend *Nask* <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[1](#fn_1571) that *towards*

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dûkdâv <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[1](#fn_1572), the mother of Zaratû*s*t, when she
was pregnant with Zaratû*s*t, *for* three nights, every night a leader
(khû*d*â) <span id="fr_1585"></span>[2](#fn_1573) with a hundred and
fifty <span id="fr_1586"></span>[3](#fn_1574) demons rushed for the
destruction of Zaratû*s*t, *but* owing to the existence of the fire in
the dwelling they knew no means of accomplishing *it*.

5\. The rule is this, that they have a tank (mô*g*) for the disciples,
when they are going to perform the worship of God, *and* are sprinkling
the stone *seat* (magôk) <span id="fr_1587"></span>[4](#fn_1575); and
lest they should make a wet *place* by that sprinkling through taking
*water* out from it, it is to be done sitting; for in the Vendidad <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[5](#fn_1576) the high-priests *have* taught, about
making

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

water *when standing* on foot <span id="fr_1589"></span>[1](#fn_1577),
that the measure it refers to applies to everything else, not even of a
like origin; by him who makes water the Avesta <span
id="fr_1590"></span>[2](#fn_1578) for making water is to be uttered,
*and* then *it* is the root of a Tanâpûhar sin <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[3](#fn_1579) for *him*, and when he does not utter
*it he* is more grievously sinful.

6\. The rule is this, that to recite the Gâthas over those passed away
is not to be considered as beneficial, since it is not proper to recite
the three Hâs <span id="fr_1592"></span>[4](#fn_1580) which are the
beginning of the Aû*s*tû*v*at Gâtha whenever *one is* on the road;
whenever *one* recites *them* over a man in the house *they are*
healing.

7\. The rule is this, that in the night wine and aromatic herbs (sparam)
and anything like food are not to be cast away towards the north
quarter, because a fiend <span id="fr_1593"></span>[5](#fn_1581) *will*
become pregnant; and when *one* casts *them* away one
Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <span id="fr_1594"></span>[6](#fn_1582) is to be
uttered.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

8\. The rule is this, that reverential *should be* the abstinence from
unlawfully slaughtering of *any* species of animals; for in the
Stû*d*gar *Nask* <span id="fr_1595"></span>[1](#fn_1583) it is said,
concerning those who *have* unlawfully slaughtered animals, the
punishment is such that *each* hair of those animals becomes like a
sharp dagger (têkh), and he who is unlawfully a slaughterer is slain. 9.
Of animals, the slaughtering of the lamb, the goat (vahîk), the
ploughing ox, the war-horse, the hare, the bat (*k*îharâ*z*), the cock
or bird of Vohûman, and the magpie (kâskînak) bird, and of birds *that
of* the kite, eagle (hûmâî), and swallow is most to be abstained from.

10\. A pregnant woman who passes away is not to be carried away by less
than four men <span id="fr_1596"></span>[2](#fn_1584), who are at it
constantly with united strength; for *with* other corpses, after a dog's
gaze, when they carry *them* along by two men with united strength, they
do not become polluted; *but* for a pregnant woman two dogs are
necessary, to whose united power *she* is to be exposed; *and* they
carry *her* along by four men with united strength, *and* they do not
become polluted; *but* when they carry *her* along by two men *they* are
to be washed with ceremony (pî*s*ak) <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[3](#fn_1585).

11\. The rule is this, that when they beg forgiveness for a person
(mar*d*ûm) who *has* passed away,

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

such *a prayer* is more significant when *one* says thus: 'Whenever a
trespass (vinâs) of mine *has* occurred against him, you will take
account *of it along* with those of his *which have* occurred against
me, and the trespasses *have* passed away one through the other; *any*
further trespasses of his *which have* occurred against me are then made
a righteous gift by me <span id="fr_1598"></span>[1](#fn_1586).'

12\. The rule is this, that *one* should not walk without boots <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[2](#fn_1587); and his advantage therefrom is even
this, that when a boot (mû*g*ak) is on *his* foot, *and* he puts the
foot upon dead matter, and does not disturb the dead matter, he does not
become polluted; when a boot is not on *his* foot, and he puts the foot
upon dead matter, and does not disturb *it*, *he is polluted* <span
id="fr_1600"></span>[3](#fn_1588), except when he knows for certain
(aêvar) that a dog *has* seen *it*, or *if* not it is to be considered
*as* not seen by a dog. <span id="fr_1601"></span>[4](#fn_1589)

13\. The rule is this, as revealed *in* the Dûbâsrû*g*ê*d* *Nask* <span
id="fr_1602"></span>[5](#fn_1590), where a day in the year is indicated,

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

that the *sacred thread*-girdle of every one who shall be one day more
than fourteen years *and* three months *old* is to be tied on—*it is*
better so than when he remains unto fifteen years, *and then* ties on
the girdle—who is more cared for, that way, than a five-months’
child <span id="fr_1603"></span>[1](#fn_1591), on whom they should put
*it* in the womb of *its* mother.

14\. The rule is this, that when *one* retains a prayer *inwardly* <span
id="fr_1604"></span>[2](#fn_1592), and wind shall come *from* below,
*or* wind shall come from the mouth, it is all one <span
id="fr_1605"></span>[3](#fn_1593).

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

15\. Also this, that ten women are necessary for affording assistance
*to* a woman who is in labour: five women for directing the making of
the cradle (gavârak), one woman should be opposite the left shoulder,
and one to hold the right shoulder, one woman to throw a hand on her
neck, one woman to hold her waist, and one woman, when the infant shall
be born, to take *it* up and cut the navel cord, and to make the fire
blaze <span id="fr_1606"></span>[1](#fn_1594). 16. Three days and three
nights no one is to pass between the fire and the child, nor to show the
child to a sinful man *or* woman; *they are* to triturate a little
sulphur in the sap (mayâ) of a plant, and to smear it over the child;
*and* the first food to give *it* is Hôm-juice (parâhôm) and aloes
(shapyâr).

17\. The rule is this, that in case any one shall beat an innocent man,
until the pain shall cease it becomes every day the root of a Tanâpûhar
sin <span id="fr_1607"></span>[2](#fn_1595) for him.

18\. The rule is this, that when in a country they trust a false judge,
and keep *him* among *their* superiors, owing to the sin and breach of
faith which that judge commits, the clouds *and* rain, in that country,
are deficient, a portion (bavan) of the deliciousness, fatness,
wholesomeness, and milk of the cattle and goats diminishes <span
id="fr_1608"></span>[3](#fn_1596), and many children become destroyed in
the mother's womb.

19\. The rule is this, that a man, when he does not wed a wife, does not
become worthy of death; *but* when a woman does not wed a husband it

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

amounts to *a sin* worthy of death; because *for* a woman *there* is no
offspring except by intercourse with men, and no lineage proceeds from
her; *but for* a man without a wife, when he shall recite the Avesta, as
it is mentioned in the Vendidad <span id="fr_1609"></span>[1](#fn_1597),
*there may be* a lineage which proceeds onwards *to* the future
existence.

20\. The rule is this, that a toothpick is to be cut out clear of bark
(pôst pâk) <span id="fr_1610"></span>[2](#fn_1598), for the high-priests
*have* taught that when one's toothpick—made for the mouth with the
bark—shall fall, and when a pregnant woman puts a foot upon it, *she* is
apprehensive about *its* being dead matter <span
id="fr_1611"></span>[3](#fn_1599).

21\. The rule is this, that in accepting the child of a handmaid
(*k*akar) <span id="fr_1612"></span>[4](#fn_1600) discrimination is to
be exercised; for in the fourteenth *of the* Nask Hûspâram <span
id="fr_1613"></span>[5](#fn_1601)

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

the high-priests *have* taught thus: 'My son is suitable also as thy
son, *but* my daughter is not suitable also as thy daughter.'

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

22\. The rule is this, that *one* perseveres much in the begetting of
offspring, for the acquisition of abundance of good works at once;
because, in the Nihâ*d*ûm Nask <span id="fr_1614"></span>[1](#fn_1602),
the high-priests *have* taught that the duty and good works which a son
performs are as much the father's as though they had been done by his
own hand; and in the Dâmdâ*d* *Nask* <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[2](#fn_1603) it is revealed thus: 'Likewise, too,
the good works, *in* like measure, which come into the father's
possession.'

23\. The rule is this, that they shall give to the worthy as much of
anything as is proper for eating *and* accumulating; because in the
Nihâ*d*ûm *Nask* <span id="fr_1616"></span>[3](#fn_1604) the
high-priests *have* taught thus: 'A man gives a hungry *one* bread, *and
it is* too much, yet all the good works, which he shall perform through
that superabundance, become as much his *who gave it* as though they had
been done by his own hand.'

24\. The rule is this, where *one* lies down, in circumstances of
propriety and innocence, one Ashem-vohû is to be uttered <span
id="fr_1617"></span>[4](#fn_1605), and *in* like manner when he

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

gets up well; when he does so, every single drawing of the breath (vayô)
becomes a good work of three Srôshô-*k*aranâms, that is, a weight of ten
dirhams of the full weight of four mads <span
id="fr_1618"></span>[1](#fn_1606).

25\. The rule is this, that when an action or an opinion comes forward,
and *one* does not know whether *it be* a sin or a good work, when
possible it is to be abandoned *and* not executed by him; as it says in
the Sakâ*d*ûm *Nask* <span id="fr_1619"></span>[2](#fn_1607) that
Zaratû*s*t *has*

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

not provided about everything whatever, but three times *it has been
done* by Zaratû*s*t about this duty, that is, so that the Avesta *and*
Zand, when *one has* learned it thoroughly by heart <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[1](#fn_1608), is for recitation, *and* is not to be
mumbled <span id="fr_1621"></span>[2](#fn_1609) (*g*ûyi*s*nŏ), for in
mumbling (*g*û*d*anŏ) the parts of the Ahunavar <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[3](#fn_1610) are more chattering <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[4](#fn_1611). 26. As it says in the Bagh
*Nask* <span id="fr_1624"></span>[5](#fn_1612)

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

thus: "Whoever shall mutter, O Zaratû*s*t! my allotment of the
Ahunavar <span id="fr_1625"></span>[1](#fn_1613)—that is, shall softly
take *it inwardly—and* shall let *it* escape <span
id="fr_1626"></span>[2](#fn_1614) again—that is, shall utter *it
aloud*—so much as a half, or one-third, or one-fourth, or one-fifth, his
soul will I shield, I who am Aûharmazd, from the best existence—that is,
I *will* keep it away—by so much of an interval as the width of this
earth.'

27\. The rule is this, that *one* is to proceed with great deliberation
when he does not know whether *it be* a sin or a good work, that is, it
is not to be done.

28\. The rule is this, that an opinion (andâ*z*ak) of anything is to be
formed through consultation

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

with the good; even so it is revealed in the *K*î*d*ra*s*t *Nask* <span
id="fr_1627"></span>[1](#fn_1615) that Spendarma*d* spoke to
Mânû*sk*îhar thus: 'Even the swiftest horse requires the whip
(tâ*z*ânak),

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

the sharpest steel knife requires the whetstone (afsân), and the wisest
man requires counsel (hampûrsîh).'

29\. The rule is this, that when *one* laughs outright (barâ khandê*d*)
the Avesta and Zand are not to be mumbled, for the wisdom of Aûharmazd
is omniscient, *and* good works are a great exercise of liberality, but
an extreme abstinence from producing irritation
(han*g*î*d*âr-dahî*s*nîh); because in the Ratû*s*tâîtîh *Nask* <span
id="fr_1628"></span>[1](#fn_1616), many harsh things are said about the
severe punishment of producers of irritation, in the spiritual
*existence*.

30\. The rule is this, that *as* there *may* be *some* even of those of
the good religion *who*, through unacquaintance with the religion, when
a female *fowl* crows in the manner of a cock, will kill the

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

fowl, so those of the primitive faith <span
id="fr_1629"></span>[1](#fn_1617) *have* said that there *may* be
mischief (vinâstârîh) from wizards in that dwelling, *which* the cock is
incapable of keeping away, and the female *fowl* makes that noise for
the assistance of the cock <span id="fr_1630"></span>[2](#fn_1618),
especially when the bringing of another cock into that dwelling is
necessary.

31\. The rule is this, that when *one* sees a hedgehog, then *along*
with it <span id="fr_1631"></span>[3](#fn_1619) a place in the plain,
free from danger, is to be preserved; for in the Vendidad <span
id="fr_1632"></span>[4](#fn_1620) the high-priests *have* taught that it
is when the hedgehog every day voids urine into an ant's nest that a
thousand ants will die.

32\. The rule is this, that in the Vendidad <span
id="fr_1633"></span>[5](#fn_1621) seven kinds of things are mentioned,
*and* when they are the cause of a man's death, until the forthcoming
period *of the day* (gâs-i levîn) comes on,

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

contamination (nisrû*s*t) <span id="fr_1634"></span>[1](#fn_1622) does
not rush upon him; and for this reason, this, too, is well *for* the
good, that is, to show a dog rightly again a previous corpse in the
forthcoming period *of the day* <span id="fr_1635"></span>[2](#fn_1623).

33\. The rule is this, that by those who attend to a corpse among the
pure *it* is then to be shown *to* a dog very observant of the corpse;
for when even a thousand persons shall carry away a corpse which a dog
*has* not seen, they are all polluted <span
id="fr_1636"></span>[3](#fn_1624).

34\. The rule is this, that meat, when there is stench or, decomposition
not even originating with *it*, is not to be prayed *over* <span
id="fr_1637"></span>[4](#fn_1625)*; and* the sacred cake (drôn) and
butter (gâû*s*-dâk) which are hairy are also not to be prayed over <span
id="fr_1638"></span>[5](#fn_1626).

35\. A woman is fit for priestly duty (zôtîh) among women <span
id="fr_1639"></span>[6](#fn_1627), and when she is consecrating <span
id="fr_1640"></span>[7](#fn_1628) the sacred

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

cake (drôn), and one Ashem-vohû <span id="fr_1641"></span>[1](#fn_1629)
is uttered by her, she puts the *sacred* twigs (baresôm) back on the
twig-stand, brings *them* away, and the utterance of another one is
good; when she says it is not expedient to do *it* with attention before
a meal, it is proper. 36. The sacred cake of a disreputable woman is not
to be consecrated, but is to be rendered ineligible (avi*g*înakŏ).

37\. When *one* places a thing before the fire observantly, and does not
see the splendour itself, 'tava âthrô <span
id="fr_1642"></span>[2](#fn_1630)' is not to be said.

38\. At night, when <span id="fr_1643"></span>[3](#fn_1631) *one* lies
down, the hands are to be thoroughly washed. 39: That which comes from a
menstruous woman to any one, or to anything, is all to be thoroughly
washed with bull's urine (gômê*z*) and water <span
id="fr_1644"></span>[4](#fn_1632).

\[40. The rule is this, as Âtarô-pâ*d* *son of* Mâraspend <span
id="fr_1645"></span>[5](#fn_1633) said when every one passed away:—'The
mouth-veil <span id="fr_1646"></span>[6](#fn_1634) and also the clothing
are to be well

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

set *apart* from the gifts (dasarân), so that his soul may become
easier.' Completed in peace and pleasure.\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1564"></span>[314:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1576) Reading âînak;
Pâzand writers convert it into yak, which can, however, have the same
meaning, though they evidently take the word to be Huz. khadûk, 'one,'
which is written precisely like âînak in Pahlavi characters. Most of the
miscellaneous statements, contained in the latter part of Sls., commence
with this phrase.

<span id="fn_1565"></span>[315:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1577) That is, round
the waist (see Chap. IV, 1).

<span id="fn_1566"></span>[315:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1578) That is,
'interpretation or exposition' (see Chap. I, 3, 4). K20 has, 'and by
every teaching it is proper.'

<span id="fn_1567"></span>[315:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1579) These
fravar*d*îkân are, strictly speaking, the five supplementary days at the
end of the Parsi year, but the last five days of the last month are
usually added to them, so as to make a period of ten days at the end of
the year, during which the guardian spirits of the departed are supposed
to revisit their old homes, and for whom the sacred cake is set aside.

<span id="fn_1568"></span>[315:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1580) The initiatory
ceremony of a young priest (see Chap. XIII, 2).

<span id="fn_1569"></span>[315:5](sbe0570.htm#fr_1581) The ceremonies
performed by the survivors for three nights after a death (see Chaps.
VIII, 6, XVII, 3, 4).

<span id="fn_1570"></span>[315:6](sbe0570.htm#fr_1582) This was the
fifteenth nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature,
according to the Dînkar*d*, which calls it Nîkâ*d*ûm; but according to
the Dînî-vagarkar*d* and the Rivâyats it was the sixteenth nask, called
Niyârum. For its contents, as given by the Dînî-vagarkar*d*, see Haug's
Essays, p. 132. The following is a brief summary of the account of it
given in the eighth book of the Dînkar*d*, where it occupies twenty-five
quarto pages of that work:—

The beginning of the law (dâ*d*) is the Nîkâ*d*ûm of thirty fargar*d*s.
The section Patkâr-ra*d*istân ('the arbitrator's code') is about umpires
and arbitration, contracts by words of four kinds and by signs of six
kinds; and twelve sorts of arbitrators are described in four
sub-sections, according as they decide by hearing or seeing, and with
regard to women and children, foreigners and <span id="page_316">p.
316</span> those worthy of death. The second section, Za*d*amistân ('the
assault code'), is a treatise on assault and the consequences of
assault, pain, blood, and unconsciousness; on blows and conflicts, man
with man, women with women, and child with child, with their proper
penalties; also the murder of slaves and children. The third section,
Rêshistân ('the wound code'), is a treatise on various kinds of wounds
and their characteristics. The fourth section, Hamêmâlistân ('the
accuser's code'), is a treatise on accusation and false accusation of
various specified crimes, on lying and slander, the care of pregnant
women, impenitence and various offences against priests and disciples,
remitting penalties, abetting and assisting criminals, mediation,
punishment of children, smiting foreigners, murder, medical treatment,
and many other things (see Pahl.-Pâz. Glossary, p. 184, where they are
erroneously ascribed to the Pâ*z*ôn Nask, owing to the defective text of
the MS. M13). The fifth section contained twenty-four treatises on
miscellaneous subjects connected with crime and sin (see Pahl.-Pâz.
Glossary, pp. 184, 185).

The passage mentioned in the text cannot be recognised in any of the
details supplied by the Dînkar*d*.

<span id="fn_1571"></span>[316:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1583) This was the
thirteenth nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature,
according to all authorities, but is called Sfend in the Rivâyats. For
its contents, as given by the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*, see Haug's Essays, pp.
131, 132. The following is a summary of the short account of it given in
the eighth book of the Dînkar*d*:—

The Spend is a treatise on the origin and combination of the existence,
guardian spirit, and glory of Zaratû*s*t; on his generation and birth;
on the coming of the two spirits, the good one to sustain, and the bad
one to destroy him, and the victory of the good <span id="page_317">p.
317</span> spirit; on his going, at thirty years of age, to confer with
Aûharmazd, and his seven conferences in ten years; on the seven
questions he proposed to the archangels on those occasions; on the
conveyance of the omniscient wisdom into him, showing him heaven and
hell, and the intermediate place of those 'ever-stationary,' the account
taken of sin and good works, the future existence, and the fate of the
religion on earth till the renovation of the universe, with the coming
of his future sons, the last three apostles.

<span id="fn_1572"></span>[317:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1584) The Pâz. Dughdâ
of Bund. XXXII, 10 would indicate Pahl. Dûkdân, but the Dînkar*d* has
Dûk*d*âûbŏ and Dûk*d*âûbag (pointing to Av. Dughdhavan), and the Persian
forms are Dughdû and Dughdavîh. Here the name is Dûkdâvŏ, which is
transposed into Dû*d*kâv in Chap. XII, 11; it must have meant either
'milk-maid' or 'suckler' originally.

<span id="fn_1573"></span>[317:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1585) K20 has *s*ê*d*â,
'a demon,' and in Chap. XII, 11, where this section is repeated, the
word can be read either *s*êdâ, 'a demon,' or shâh, 'a king or ruler;'
of course 'an arch-fiend' is meant.

<span id="fn_1574"></span>[317:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1586) M6 appears to
have 'sixty,' instead of 'fifty,' but see Chap. XII, 11.

<span id="fn_1575"></span>[317:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1587) Or magh, on which
they squat in the purification ceremony (see B. Yt. II, 36).

<span id="fn_1576"></span>[317:5](sbe0570.htm#fr_1588) Referring
probably to Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 98; the ground is not to be wetted
further than the length of the fore-part of the foot beyond the toes,
that is, not more than a hand's breadth; this <span id="page_318">p.
318</span> measure is here extended to washing water, hence the
necessity of squatting during such ablutions.

<span id="fn_1577"></span>[318:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1589) This is a sin
which is usually classed with 'running about uncovered' and 'walking
with one boot' (see Chap. IV, 8, note).

<span id="fn_1578"></span>[318:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1590) This Avesta is
prescribed in Vend. XVIII, 97, and is still in constant use; it consists
of three Ashem-vohûs (see Bund. XX, 2), two Humatanãms (Yas. XXXV, 4-6),
three Hukhshathrôtemâis (Yas. XXXV, 13-15), four Ahunavars (see Bund. I,
21), and one YêNhê-hâtãm (see B. Yt. II, 64).

<span id="fn_1579"></span>[318:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1591) See Chap. I, 1,
2.

<span id="fn_1580"></span>[318:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1592) The three
chapters (Yas. XLII-XLIV) which begin the U*s*tavaiti Gâtha (Yas.
XLII-XLV).

<span id="fn_1581"></span>[318:5](sbe0570.htm#fr_1593) A drû*g*, or
fiend, is usually considered as a female demon (see Vend. XVIII, 70-77);
and the demons are supposed to come from the north, where they
congregate on the summit of Are*z*ûr, at the gates of hell (see Vend.
XIX, 1, 140) 142, Bund. XII, 8).

<span id="fn_1582"></span>[318:6](sbe0570.htm#fr_1594) See Bund. I, 21.
This statement is repeated in Chap. XII, 18.

<span id="fn_1583"></span>[319:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1595) See B. Yt. I, 1.
The passage here referred to is probably one in the middle of the
seventeenth fargard of this Nask, which is mentioned as follows, in the
ninth book of the Dînkar*d*: 'And this too, namely, those who unlawfully
slay sheep and cattle, which diminishes their life and glory.'

<span id="fn_1584"></span>[319:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1596) This is the usual
custom, while that mentioned in Chap. II, 6 is the exceptional case,
mentioned at the end of this section, which necessitates extraordinary
purification.

<span id="fn_1585"></span>[319:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1597) That is, with the
Bareshnûm ceremony (see Chap. II, 6).

<span id="fn_1586"></span>[320:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1598) That is, I pardon
them in charity.

<span id="fn_1587"></span>[320:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1599) Or, perhaps,
'without stockings,' avîmû*g*ak; this seems to be something different
from the sin of aê-mûk-dûbâri*s*nîh, running in one boot' (see Chap. IV,
12).

<span id="fn_1588"></span>[320:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1600) Without these
words, which do not exist in the MSS., the sentence seems to have no
clear meaning.

<span id="fn_1589"></span>[320:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1601) And, therefore,
still containing the Nasû*s*, or fiend of corruption, who will enter
into any one who merely touches the dead matter, without disturbing it,
and can be driven out only by the tedious and troublesome Bareshnûm
ceremony.

<span id="fn_1590"></span>[320:5](sbe0570.htm#fr_1602) This was the
sixteenth nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature,
according to the Dînkar*d*, which calls it Dûbâsrûg*d* or Dûbâsrû*d*;
but according to the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*, which calls it Dvâsrûzd, and
the Rivâyats, which call it Dvâsrû*g*ad, Dvâsrûn*g*ad, or Dvâsrûb, it
was the eighteenth nask. For its contents, as given by the
Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*, see Haug's Essays, pp. 132, 133. The following is a
brief summary of the account of it given <span id="page_321">p.
321</span> in the eighth book of the Dînkar*d*, which occupies ten
quarto pages of that work:—

Of the first eighteen sections of the Dûbâsrûg*d* the first is a
treatise on thieves, their arrest, imprisonment, and punishment, with
the various kinds of robbery; the second section is about the
irresponsibility of a father for the crimes of a grown-up son, and of a
husband for those of a separated wife, about the time for instructing
children, and when they first become responsible for sin, the crime of
giving weapons to women, children, and foreigners, about warriors
plundering, the various kinds of judges and their duties, and offences
against accusers. Of the twelve next sections one, called
Pasû*s*-hôrvistân ('the shepherd's dog code'), is about shepherd's dogs,
their duties and rights. Of the last thirty-five sections the first,
called Stôristân ('the beast of burden code'), is about the sin,
affecting the soul, of unlawfully beating and wounding cattle and beasts
of burden, birds and fish; the second section, Ar*g*istân ('the value
code'), is a treatise on the value of animate and inanimate objects;
the. third section, Aratê*s*târistân ('the warrior code'), is a treatise
on warriors, arms, armies, generals, battles, plunder, &c.; the fourth
section is about warm baths, fires, clothing, winter stores, reaping
fodder and corn, &c.

The passage mentioned in the text was probably in that part of the
second section which referred to the responsibility of children. The
words from 'as revealed' to 'indicated' are omitted in K20.

<span id="fn_1591"></span>[321:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1603) K20 has
'nine-months' child.'

<span id="fn_1592"></span>[321:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1604) See Chap. III, 6.

<span id="fn_1593"></span>[321:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1605) Literally, 'both
are one:' that is, in either case the spell of the vâ*g* or prayer is
broken.

<span id="fn_1594"></span>[322:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1606) Literally, 'make
the fire high.'

<span id="fn_1595"></span>[322:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1607) See Chap. I, 1,
2.

<span id="fn_1596"></span>[322:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1608) Most of these
evils are also ascribed (see B. Yt. II, 41-43) to neglect of the
precautions prescribed with regard to hair-cuttings.

<span id="fn_1597"></span>[323:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1609) This reference is
probably to the circumstances detailed in Vend. XVIII, 99-112, but the
Pahlavi commentary on §§ 111, 112 of that passage is missing in all MSS.
The Avesta to be recited in such cases is precisely the same as that
detailed in a note on § 5.

<span id="fn_1598"></span>[323:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1610) This translation
is in accordance with the seventeenth chapter of the prose Sad-dar
Bûndahi*s*, or 'Bûndahi*s* of a hundred chapters,' a Pâzand work of
later times; but the text here might be translated 'cut out of clean
skin,' and in Chap. XII, 13, where the statement is repeated, the word
used is also ambiguous.

<span id="fn_1599"></span>[323:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1611) The Sad-dar
Bûndahi*s* says, 'the fear arises that the infant may come to harm.'
This section and the three which follow are repeated in Chap. XII,
13-16.

<span id="fn_1600"></span>[323:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1612) This might mean a
*k*akar, or 'serving' wife (see Bund. XXXII, 6), but the further details
given in Chap. XII, 14, where this statement is repeated, make it more
probable that a concubine is meant.

<span id="fn_1601"></span>[323:5](sbe0570.htm#fr_1613) As this was the
seventeenth nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature,
according to all authorities, it is probable that the word 'fourteenth,'
in the text here, refers to some particular chapter or fargar*d*, most
likely to the last group of fourteen <span id="page_324">p. 324</span>
sections, mentioned below, in the summary of its contents; and this is
confirmed by another reference in Chap. XII, 7. This nask is called
Aspâram in the Rivâyats, and Aspârûm in the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*; for its
contents, as given by the latter, see Haug's Essays, p. 133. The
following is a brief summary of the account of it given in the eighth
book of the Dînkar*d*, where it occupies sixteen quarto pages of that
work:—

Of the first thirty sections of the Hûspâram, one is the Aêrpatistân
('the priest's code'), a treatise on priestly studies, priests,
disciples, and their five dispositions. One section is the Nîrangistân
('religious formula code'), a treatise on the formulas of worship, the
Avesta to be recited by the officiating priests twice, thrice, and four
times, the five periods of the day and their proper ceremonies, the
season-festivals, the sacred girdle and shirt, cutting the sacred twigs,
reverencing water, the families of Zaratû*s*t, Hvôv, and Vi*s*tâsp, &c.
One section is the Gôharîkistân ('quality code'), a treatise on nobility
and superiority, buying and selling, cattle, slaves, servants, and other
property, houses where men or dogs have been sick, dealings with
foreigners, &c. And other sections are about appropriating the property
of others, obedient and disobedient wives, foreign wives, advantages of
male and female offspring, breeding of cattle, treatment of labourers
and children, the evil eye, judges, the origin and cultivation of corn,
the degrees of crime and punishment, &c. of the next twenty sections,
one is about the treatment of furious cattle and mad dogs, and the
damage they may do. One section on the means of accumulating wealth, the
giving of sons and daughters in marriage, the goodness of charity and
evil of waste, the five best actions and the five worst, unlawful
felling of trees, the sin of burying the dead, &c. And one section on
the begetting, birth, and treatment of children. Of the last fourteen
sections, one is a treatise, in six fargar*d*s, on the ownership of
property and disputes about it, on one's own family, acquiring wife and
children, adoption, &c. And a section of seven fargar*d*s, at the end,
is a treatise on the sufferings of men, women, children, and dogs, on
the connection of owner and herds, priest and disciple, on various
offences and sins, spiritual and worldly healing, physic and physicians,
astrology, <span id="page_325">p. 325</span> the proper feeding of
cattle, horses, sheep, goats, and pigs, the duty of a frontier governor
during a foreign invasion, &c.

The passage mentioned in the text was probably in that portion of the
last group of fourteen sections which treated of wives, children, and
adoption.

<span id="fn_1602"></span>[325:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1614) See § 3; the
passage mentioned here cannot be traced in the account of this Nask
given in the Dînkar*d*.

<span id="fn_1603"></span>[325:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1615) See SZS. IX, 1.
The passage here quoted cannot be traced in any of the short accounts of
the contents of this Nask. This section is repeated, with a few verbal
alterations, in Chap. XII, 15.

<span id="fn_1604"></span>[325:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1616) See § 3; the
passage here quoted is also not to be traced in the account of this Nask
given in the Dînkar*d*. This section is repeated, with a few verbal
alterations, in Chap. XII, 16.

<span id="fn_1605"></span>[325:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1617) Compare Chap. IV,
14, where much the same is stated as what occurs, in this section.

<span id="fn_1606"></span>[326:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1618) Reading i mad-4,
instead of va maz-4; the word mad (see Pahl.-Pâz. Glossary, p. 21) being
Huz. for the dâng or quarter-dirham. The amount of the Srôshô-*k*aranâm,
as deduced from this statement, differs from those given in Chaps. XI,
2, XVI, 5, and must be awkwardly fractional, unless the sentence be
altered into 10 *g*û*g*an sang nêm zî*s* pûr sang yehevûnê*d*, 'a weight
of ten dirhams and a half, which is its full weight;' in which case one
Srôshô-*k*aranâm would be 3½ dirhams, as in Chap. XVI, 5.

<span id="fn_1607"></span>[326:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1619) This was the
eighteenth nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature,
according to the Dînkar*d*; but according to the Dînî-vagarkar*d* and
the Rivâyats if was the nineteenth nask, called Askârûm or Askâram. For
its contents, as given by the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*, see Haug's Essays, p.
133. The following is a brief summary of the account of it given in the
eighth book of the Dînkar*d*, where it occupies twenty quarto pages of
that work:—

Of the first thirty sections of the Sakâ*d*ûm one is a treatise on the
necessity of obedience and understanding the laws, on newborn infants
and their proper treatment, on the care of fire and sharp-pointed
things, on race-courses, the use of water, salt and sweet, warm and
cold, flowing and stagnant, &c. One section is the Ha*k*î*d*akânistân
('annoyances code'), a treatise on irritating words and ill-treatment of
living creatures and trees, the finding of buried treasure at various
depths and in different places, &c. And one section is the Zîyânakistân
('damage code'), a treatise on damage to animate and inanimate objects.
Of the last twenty-two sections, one is the Vakhshistân ('increase
code'), a treatise on the progress of growth, breeding of cattle and
other animals, pleadings regarding debts, growth of corn, &c. One
section is the Varistân ('ordeal code'), a treatise on the detection of
witchcraft by ordeal, by heat and cold, &c. One section on asking
assistance <span id="page_327">p. 327</span> and rewarding it, on the
unjust judge and the sagacious one, on daughters given in marriage by
mothers and brothers, on the disobedient son, &c. And one section on the
spirits of the earthly existences, the merit of killing noxious
water-creatures, the animal world proceeding from the primeval ox, the
evil spirit not to be worshipped, and much other advice.

The passage mentioned in the text appears to have been in the first
section of this Nask, as the Dînkar*d* says it treated, among other
matters, 'about a man's examining an action before doing it, *and* when
he does not know whether *it be* a sin or a good work, when possible,
*he* is to set it aside *and* not to do *it*.' But nothing is said there
about Zaratû*s*t, and what is said here seems to have very little
connection with the 'rule' laid down in this section.

<span id="fn_1608"></span>[327:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1620) Literally, 'made
it quite easy.'

<span id="fn_1609"></span>[327:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1621) Literally, 'not
to be devoured or gnawed.'

<span id="fn_1610"></span>[327:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1622) The formula
commencing with the words Yathâ ahû vairyô (see Bund. I, 21); its parts
or bagha are the phrases into which it may be divided (see Yas. XIX, 49
6, 9, 12).

<span id="fn_1611"></span>[327:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1623) Reading drâîtar,
'more clamourous or chattering;' but the word is ambiguous, as it may be
darâktar, 'more rending,' or girâîtar, 'more weighty, more threatening'
&c.

<span id="fn_1612"></span>[327:5](sbe0570.htm#fr_1624) M6 has Bak. This
was the third nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature,
according to the Dînkar*d*, which calls it Bakô; but according to the
Dînî-va*g*arkar*d* and the Rivâyats it was the fourth nask. For its
contents, as given by the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*, see Haug's Essays, p. 127.
In the Dînkar*d*, besides a very brief account of it, in the eighth
book, which states that it was a treatise on the recitation of the
revealed texts, there is, in the ninth book, a long description of the
contents of each of its twenty-two fargar*d*s, occupying, fifty quarto
pages in the MSS, of the Dînkar*d*. From this it appears that the
passage quoted in our text probably occurred in the first <span
id="page_328">p. 328</span> fargar*d*. It also occurs, in nearly the
same words, in Pahl. Yas. XIX 12-15, and as Yas. XIX is called 'the
beginning of the Bakân' in some MSS., it is possible that the three Hâs
(Yas. XIX-XXI) which relate to the three short Avesta formulas are
really the first three fargar*d*s of the Bagh Nask, which are said to
have treated of the same subjects.

<span id="fn_1613"></span>[328:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1625) The text is
corrupted into min zak-i li, Zaratû*s*t! bê*s*târîh-i min Ahunavar
drû*g*ist, which might be translated, in connection with the following
phrase, thus: 'of my vexation, O Zaratû*s*t! from the Ahunavar, the most
fiendish is that *one* shall softly take *it*,' &c. But very slight
alterations of the Pahlavi letters (in accordance with Pahl. Yas. XIX,
12) convert min into mûn, bê*s*târîh into bâkhtârîh, and drû*g*ist into
dren*g*â*d*. Instead of 'allotment of the Ahunavar' we might read
'predestination, or providence, from the Ahunavar;' because the Pahlavi
translator, by using the word bâkhtârîh or bakhtârîh, appears to have
understood the Av. bagha in its sense of 'divinity, providence,' rather
than in that of 'part, portion.'

<span id="fn_1614"></span>[328:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1626) Reading rânînê*d*
or rahôînê*d*. The Pahlavi translator seems to think the sin consists in
breaking the spell of the vâ*g* or inward prayer (see Chap. III, 6) by
speaking part of it aloud; but the original Avesta of this passage
attributes the sin to obscuring the meaning by imperfect recitation.

<span id="fn_1615"></span>[329:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1627) This was the
twelfth nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature,
according to the Dînkar*d*, which calls it *K*i*d*ra*s*tô or
*K*i*d*rô*s*tô; but according to the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d* and the Rivâyats
it was the fourteenth nask called *G*ira*s*t. For its contents, as given
by the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*, see Haug's Essays, p. 131. The following is a
summary of the short account of it given in the eighth book of the
Dînkar*d*:—

The *K*i*d*rô*s*tô is a treatise on the race of man; how Aûharmazd
produced the first man, Gâyômar*d*, how the first pair, Mashya and
Mashyôî, arose, with their progeny, till the region of Khvanîras was
full, when they supplied the six surrounding regions, till they filled
and cultivated the whole world. The Pê*s*dâ*d*ian dynasty of Hôshâng,
Tâkhmôrupŏ, and Yim, the evil reign of Dahâk, descended from Tâ*z*, the
brother of Hôshâng and father of the Arabs, then Frê*d*ûn who divided
Khvanîras between his three sons, Salm, Tû*g*, and Aîrî*k*, who married
the daughters of Pâtsrôbô (compare Pahl. Vend. XX, 4) king of the Arabs,
then Manû*sk*îhar, descendant (nâpô) of Aîrî*k*, the penal reign of
Frâsîyâ*v* ruler of Tûrân, then Aûzôbô the Tûmâspian, descendant of
Mânû*sk*îhar, then Kaî-Kavâ*d* and the penal reign of Karsâspô. The
Kayânian dynasty of Kâî-Us, Kaî-Khûsrôb son of Sîyâvakhsh, with many
tales of the specially famous races of Iran, Tûrân, and Salmân, even to
the reigns of Kaî-Lôharâsp and Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp. The apostle Zaratû*s*t,
and the progress of time and events from the reign of Frê*d*ûn till
Zaratû*s*t's conference with Aûharmazd. The race of Mânû*sk*îhar,
Nô*d*ar, and others. Avarethrab*a*u's (see Fravardîn Yt. 106) father,
Âtarô-pâ*d* son of Mâraspend. On future events and the reign of the
renovation of the universe; the origin of the knowledge of occupation,
and the care and industry of the period; the great acquaintance of
mankind with the putting aside of injury from the adversary, the
preservation of the body, and the deliverance of the soul, both before
and after the time of Zaratû*s*t.

As Mânû*sk*îhar is several times mentioned there are several places in
this Nask where the statement, quoted in the text as a saying of
Spendarma*d*, the female archangel who has special charge of the earth
(see Chap. XV, 5, 20-24, and Bund. I, 26), may have occurred.

<span id="fn_1616"></span>[330:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1628) This was the
seventh nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature,
according to the Dînkar*d*, which calls it Ratû*s*tâîtî; but according
to the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d* and the Rivâyats it was the eighth nask called
Ratu*s*tâî. For its contents, as given by the Dînî-va*g*arkar*d*, see
Haug's Essays, p. 129. The following is a summary of the short account
of it given in the eighth book of the Dînkar*d*:—

The Ratû*s*tâîtî is a treatise on indispensable religious practices, the
reason of the worthiness and superexcellence in a purifying priest, and
how to distinguish worthiness and superexcellence from unworthiness, in
the priesthood of each of the seven regions of the earth; on the
indication and manifestation of an assemblage of the archangels, the
formulas and means to be employed in reverencing the angels, the
position and duties of the two officiating priests in the ceremonies,
and all the business of the orderers of ceremonies, with their various
duties; on the greatness and voluntariness of good works, the kinds of
voluntariness, and the proximity of Aûharmazd to the thoughts, words,
and deeds of the material world.

It is uncertain under which of these heads the passage mentioned in the
text may have occurred.

<span id="fn_1617"></span>[331:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1629) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1618"></span>[331:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1630) The cock is
considered to be an opponent of demons and wizards (see Bund. XIX, 33),
and to warn men against the seductions of the demoness of lethargy (see
Vend. XVIII, 33-42, 52).

<span id="fn_1619"></span>[331:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1631) Assuming that
levatman val means levatman valman, but the reading 'he takes *it* back
to (lakhvâr val) the plain,' which occurs in the repetition of this
section in Chap. XII, 20, seems preferable.

<span id="fn_1620"></span>[331:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1632) The details which
follow are to be found in Bund. XIX, 28, but they appear to be no longer
extant in the Pahlavi Vendidad; though the hedgehog is called 'the
slayer of the thousands of the evil spirit,' in Vend. XIII, 5, of which
passage the statement in our text seems to be an illustration. The ant
is considered noxious.

<span id="fn_1621"></span>[331:5](sbe0570.htm#fr_1633) Vend. VII, 5, 6,
where, however, eight modes of death are mentioned, which delay the
arrival of the Nasû*s*, or fiend of corruption, till the next period of
the day; these are when the person has been killed by a dog, a wolf, a
wizard, anxiety, falling into a pit, the hand of man as sentenced by
law, illegal violence, or strangulation. In all other cases it is
supposed that the fiend of corruption enters the corpse immediately
after death (see Vend. VII, 2-4).

<span id="fn_1622"></span>[332:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1634) See Bund. XXVIII,
29.

<span id="fn_1623"></span>[332:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1635) In order that
there may be no risk of the fiend of corruption having entered the
corpse after it was first exhibited to a dog.

<span id="fn_1624"></span>[332:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1636) This statement
has been already made in Chap. II, 65.

<span id="fn_1625"></span>[332:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1637) That is, it is
not to be used in any religious ceremony. Small pieces of meat are
consecrated, along with the sacred cakes, in the Drôn and Âfrîngân
ceremonies at certain festivals.

<span id="fn_1626"></span>[332:5](sbe0570.htm#fr_1638) So in K20; but M6
has, 'the sacred cake they present, even that is not to be prayed over.'
Although M6 is more carefully written than K20, it seems to have been
copied from an original which was hardly legible in some places, of
which this is one. The presence of a hair in the cake or butter would
render it useless for religious purposes.

<span id="fn_1627"></span>[332:6](sbe0570.htm#fr_1639) But only for some
of the minor priestly offices, such as consecrating the sacred cake.
According to Avesta passages, quoted in the Nîrangistân, any man who is
not a Tanâpûhar sinner can perform certain priestly duties for virtuous
men, and any woman who is not feeble-minded (kasu-khrathwa) can perform
them for children.

<span id="fn_1628"></span>[332:7](sbe0570.htm#fr_1640) M6 has, 'when she
does not consecrate.'

<span id="fn_1629"></span>[333:1](sbe0570.htm#fr_1641) See Bund. XX, 2;
it is rather doubtful whether we should read 'one' or, 'two.'

<span id="fn_1630"></span>[333:2](sbe0570.htm#fr_1642) These Avesta
words, meaning 'for thee, the fire,' are used when presenting anything
to the fire, such as firewood and incense (see Yas. VII, 3, XXII, 10,
22, &c.)

<span id="fn_1631"></span>[333:3](sbe0570.htm#fr_1643) Reading amat,
'when,' instead of mûn, 'who' (see Bund. I, 7, note).

<span id="fn_1632"></span>[333:4](sbe0570.htm#fr_1644) Here ends the
original Shâyast lâ-shâyast. § 40 is found only in M6, and is evidently
a later addition to that MS. by another hand. Then follows the Farhang-i
Oîm-khadûk, both in M6 and K20; this is an old Avesta-Pahlavi Glossary
which has no connection with Sls., although it may be of the same age,
as it quotes many Avesta sentences which are no longer extant elsewhere,
and amongst others passages from the Nihâ*d*ûm Nask (see Sls. X, 3) and
the commentary of Afarg (see Sls. I, 3).

<span id="fn_1633"></span>[333:5](sbe0570.htm#fr_1645) See Bund. XXXIII,
3.

<span id="fn_1634"></span>[333:6](sbe0570.htm#fr_1646) The padâm (Av.
paitidâna, Pâz. penôm) 'consists of two <span id="page_334">p.
334</span> pieces of white cotton cloth, hanging loosely from the bridge
of the nose to at least two inches below the mouth, and tied with two
strings at the back of the head. It must be worn by a priest whenever he
approaches the sacred fire, so as to prevent his breath from
contaminating the fire. On certain occasions a layman has to use a
substitute for the penôm by screening his mouth and nose with a portion
of his muslin shirt.' (Haug's Essays, p. 243, note 1; see also Pahl.
Vend. XVIII, 1-4.)
