### CHAPTER V.

1\. Of unseasonable chatter <span id="fr_1468"></span>[2](#fn_1459) that
of children of five years of age has no root; and from five years till
seven years, when *one* is under the tuition of his

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

father *and* innocent <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1](#fn_1460), it has no
root *in* him, and when sinful it has root *in* the father <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[2](#fn_1461). 2. And from eight years till *they
are* man and woman of fifteen years, if even *one* is innocent during
the performance of the ritual (ya*s*tô), but is able to say its Ithâ and
Ashem-vohû <span id="fr_1471"></span>[3](#fn_1462), and does not say
*them, it* is the root of unseasonable chatter for him <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[4](#fn_1463); and when *he* is able to perform
*his* ritual by heart (narm), and says *only* the Ithâ and Ashem-vohû,
some *have* said that such is as when his ritual is not performed *and
there* is no offering (yastôfrî*d*), and some *have* said that it is not
unseasonable chatter.

3\. Unseasonable chatter *may* occur at every ceremonial (ya*z*i*s*nŏ);
*for* him who has performed the ritual it is a Tanâpûhar *sin <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[5](#fn_1464); for* him who has not performed the
ritual *it* is less, some *have* said three Srôshô-*k*aranâms <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[6](#fn_1465). 4. The measure of unseasonable
chatter is a Tanâpûhar *sin*; this is where every ceremony, or every
morsel, or every *drop of* urine is not completed <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[7](#fn_1466). 5. Of the unseasonable chatter of

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

him who has not performed the ritual Afarg <span
id="fr_1476"></span>[1](#fn_1467) said this degree is slighter;
Mê*d*ôk-mâh <span id="fr_1477"></span>[1](#fn_1467) said both are alike,
and he spoke further of this, since for him who has not performed the
ritual, and does not attend to <span id="fr_1478"></span>[2](#fn_1468)
saying its Ithâ and Ashem-vohû, it is more severe than for him who has
performed the ritual, and does not attend to consecrating its sacred
cake (drôn). 6. Mê*d*ôk-mâh said that it (the ceremonial) <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[3](#fn_1469) does not become Gêtô-kharî*d* <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[4](#fn_1470); Afarg said that it amounts to an
offering (yastôfrî*d*) <span id="fr_1481"></span>[5](#fn_1471) for every
one, except for that person who *knows* the ritual by heart, and through
sinfulness will not perform *it;* and it becomes *his* at the time when,
during his life *and* by his command, it is recited with this intention,
namely: 'I wish to do *it*, my faith (astôbânîh) is in the
religion <span id="fr_1482"></span>[6](#fn_1472).'

7\. The deaf and dumb when it is not possible for him to say an Ashem
does not commit unseasonable chatter <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[7](#fn_1473); and when it is possible for him to
say an Ashem he shall three times say of it, 'Ashem, ashem, ashem;' and
if it be possible for him to say

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'ithâ' and
'ashem-vohû' it is well, and when it is only possible for him to say
'ithâ' it matters not <span id="fr_1484"></span>[1](#fn_1474).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1459"></span>[290:2](sbe0565.htm#fr_1468) See Chap. IV, 9.

<span id="fn_1460"></span>[291:1](sbe0565.htm#fr_1469) That is,
intending no harm, as contrasted with sinful or wilful chatter in
defiance of instruction.

<span id="fn_1461"></span>[291:2](sbe0565.htm#fr_1470) Because the
father is supposed to be responsible, in the next world, for the sins of
the child, even as he will profit by its good works (see, Chaps. X, 22,
XII, 15).

<span id="fn_1462"></span>[291:3](sbe0565.htm#fr_1471) See Chap. III,
35.

<span id="fn_1463"></span>[291:4](sbe0565.htm#fr_1472) Inattention to
prayers evinced by improper silence is thus put upon the same footing as
inattention evinced by improper talking. This portion of the sentence is
omitted in K20.

<span id="fn_1464"></span>[291:5](sbe0565.htm#fr_1473) See Chap. I, 1,
2. It is a greater sin in the officiating priests than in the other
persons present at the ceremony.

<span id="fn_1465"></span>[291:6](sbe0565.htm#fr_1474) Probably a Farmân
sin (see Chap. IV, 14, note).

<span id="fn_1466"></span>[291:7](sbe0565.htm#fr_1475) Referring to the
three principal occasions when a prayer (vâ*g*), is taken inwardly and
retained until the completion of the action; during which time it is
unlawful to say anything but the prescribed prayers (see Chap. III, 6,
note).

<span id="fn_1467"></span>[292:1](sbe0565.htm#fr_1477) See Chap. I, 3.

<span id="fn_1468"></span>[292:2](sbe0565.htm#fr_1478) Literally,
'believe or trust to.'

<span id="fn_1469"></span>[292:3](sbe0565.htm#fr_1479) During which
unseasonable chatter occurs.

<span id="fn_1470"></span>[292:4](sbe0565.htm#fr_1480) Generally written
Gêtî-kharî*d* (see Bund. XXX, 28); but, perhaps, we should here read
yastôfrî*d*, 'offering,' though gêtôk-kharî*d* occurs in Chap. XII, 30.

<span id="fn_1471"></span>[292:5](sbe0565.htm#fr_1481) The MSS. have
merely stôfrî*d*, which differs from the foregoing gêtô-kharî*d* only in
one Pahlavi letter, so we should probably read the same word in both
cases, but which of them it ought to be is uncertain.

<span id="fn_1472"></span>[292:6](sbe0565.htm#fr_1482) Meaning,
apparently, that he can obtain the benefit of any past ceremony,
forfeited by wilful negligence, by repentance and a repetition of the
ceremony during his lifetime.

<span id="fn_1473"></span>[292:7](sbe0565.htm#fr_1483) By omitting to
say it (see § 2). This clause of the sentence is omitted in K20.

<span id="fn_1474"></span>[293:1](sbe0565.htm#fr_1484) That is, any one
barely able to speak must repeat so much of the indispensable prayers as
he is able to pronounce, otherwise he will commit sin.
