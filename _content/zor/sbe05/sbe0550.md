### CHAPTER VI.

1\. And as he (Aharman) came secondly to the water, together with him
rushed in, *on* the horse Cancer, he who is the most watery Tî*s*tar;
the equally watery *one*, that is called Avrak <span
id="fr_956"></span>[3](#fn_950), gave forth a cloud *and* went down in
the day; that is

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

declared as the movement of the first-comers of the creatures. 2. Cancer
became a zodiacal constellation (akhtar); it is the fourth constellation
*of the zodiac* for this reason, because the month Tîr is the fourth
month of the year <span id="fr_957"></span>[1](#fn_951).

3\. And as Tî*s*tar begged for assistance, Vohûman and Hôm are therefore
co-operating with him in command, Bûr*g* of the waters and the water in
mutual aid, and the righteous guardian spirits in keeping the peace. 4.
He was converted into three forms, which are the form of a man, the form
of a bull, *and* the form of a horse; and each form was distinguished in
brilliance for ten nights, and lets its rain fall on the night for the
destruction of noxious creatures. 5. The drops became each separately
*like* a great bowl in which water is drawn; and as to that on *which*
they are driven, they kill all the noxious creatures except the
reptiles <span id="fr_958"></span>[2](#fn_952), who entered into the
muddiness of the earth.

6\. Afterwards, the wind spirit, in the form of a man, became manifest
on the earth; radiant *and* tall he had a kind of wooden boot
(mûkvŏ-aê-i dârînô) on *his* feet; *and* as when the life shall stir the
body, the body is advancing with like vigour, *so* that spirit of the
wind stirs forth the inner nature of the atmospheric wind, the wind
pertaining to the whole earth is forth, and the water in its grasp is
flung out from it to the sides of the earth, and its wide-formed ocean
arose therefrom.

7\. It (the ocean) keeps one-third of this earth <span
id="fr_959"></span>[3](#fn_953),

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

and among its contents are a thousand sources *and* fountains, such as
are called lakes (var); a thousand water-fountains, whose water is from
the ocean, come up from the lakes *and* are poured forth into it. 8. And
the size of some of all the lakes and all the fountains of water is as
much as a fast rider on an Arab horse, *who* continually compasses *and*
canters around *them*, will attain in forty days, which is 1900 <span
id="fr_960"></span>[1](#fn_954), long leagues (parasang-i akarîk), each
league *being* at least 20,000 feet.

9\. And after the noxious creatures died <span
id="fr_961"></span>[2](#fn_955), and the poison therefrom was mixed up
in the earth, in order to utterly destroy that poison Tî*s*tar went down
into the ocean; and Apâôsh, the demon, hastened to meet him, and *at*
the alarm of the first contest Tî*s*tar was in terror (par*d*). 10. And
he applied unto Aûharmazd, *who* brought such power unto Tî*s*tar *as*
arises through propitiation and praise and invoking by name <span
id="fr_962"></span>[3](#fn_956), and they call forth such power unto
Tî*s*tar as *that of* ten vigorous horses, ten vigorous camels, ten
vigorous bulls, ten mountains when hurled, and ten single-stream rivers
when together. 11. And without alarm he drove out Apâôsh, the demon, and
kept him away from the sources of the ocean.

12\. And with a cup and measuring bowl, which possessed the diligence
even of a guardian spirit (fravâhar), he seized many more handfuls of
water,

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

and made *it* rain down <span id="fr_963"></span>[1](#fn_957) much more
prodigiously, for destruction, drops as large as men's heads and bulls'
heads, great and small. 13. And in that cloud and rain were the
chastisement *and* beating which Tî*s*tar and the fire Vâzi*s*t
*inflicted* on the opposition of Apâôsh; the all-deciding
(vispô-vi*k*îr) fire Vâzi*s*t struck down with a club of fire,
all-deciding among the malevolent (kêbarânŏ).

14\. Ten days *and* nights there was rain, and its darting <span
id="fr_964"></span>[2](#fn_958) *was* the shooting of the noxious
creatures; afterwards, the wind drove *it* to the shore of the
wide-formed ocean, and it is portioned out into three, and three seas
arose from it; they are called the Pûîtîk, the Kamîrî*d*, and the
Gehân-bûn <span id="fr_965"></span>[3](#fn_959). 15. Of these the Pûîtîk
itself is salt water, in which is a flow *and* ebb <span
id="fr_966"></span>[4](#fn_960); and the control of its flow and ebb is
connected with the moon, and by its continual rotation, in coming up
*and* going down, that of the moon is manifested. 16. The wide-formed
*ocean* stands forth on the south side as to (pavan) Albûr*z* <span
id="fr_967"></span>[5](#fn_961), and the Pûîtîk stands contiguous to it,
and amidst it is the gulf (var) of Satavês, whose connection is with
Satavês, which is the southern quarter. 17. In the activity of the sea,
and in the increase and decrease of the moon, whose circuit is the whole
of Iran, are the flow *and* ebb; of the

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

curving tails in front of the moon two issue forth, *and* have an abode
in Satavês; one is the up-drag *and* one the down-drag; through the
up-drag occurs the flood, *and* through the down-drag occurs the
ebb <span id="fr_968"></span>[1](#fn_962). 18. And Satavês itself is a
gulf (var) and side *arm* of the wide-formed ocean, for it drives back
the impurity *and* turbidness which *come* from the salt sea, when they
are continually going into the wide-formed ocean, with a mighty high
wind <span id="fr_969"></span>[2](#fn_963), while that which is clear
through purity goes into the [Arêdvîvsûr](errata.htm#0) sources of the
wide-formed ocean. 19. Besides these four <span
id="fr_970"></span>[3](#fn_964) there are the small seas <span
id="fr_971"></span>[4](#fn_965).

20\. And, afterwards, *there* were made to flow from Albûr*z*, out of
its northern border, two rivers <span id="fr_972"></span>[5](#fn_966),
which *were* the Arvand <span id="fr_973"></span>[6](#fn_967)—that is,
the Diglît, *and* the flow

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

of that river *was* to those of the setting *sun* (val
frô*d*-yehevun*d*ânŏ)—*and* the Vêh <span
id="fr_974"></span>[1](#fn_968) was the river of the first-comers to the
sun; formed as two horns they went on to the ocean. 21. After them
eighteen <span id="fr_975"></span>[2](#fn_969) great rivers came out
from the same Albûr*z*; *and* these twenty rivers, whose source is in
Albûr*z*, go down into the earth, and arrive in Khvanîras.

22\. Afterwards, two fountains of the sea are opened out for the
earth <span id="fr_976"></span>[3](#fn_970), which are called the
*K*ê*k*ast <span id="fr_977"></span>[4](#fn_971)—a lake which has no
cold wind, *and* on whose shore rests the triumphant fire
Gû*s*nasp <span id="fr_978"></span>[5](#fn_972) and, secondly, the
Sôvar <span id="fr_979"></span>[6](#fn_973) which casts on *its* shores
all turbidness, and keeps its own salt lake clear *and* pure, for it is
like the semblance of an eye which casts out to *its* edges every ache
and every impurity; and on account of its depth it is not reached to the
bottom, for it goes into the ocean; and in its vicinity rests the
beneficial fire Bûr*z*în-Mitrô <span id="fr_980"></span>[7](#fn_974).

23\. And this was the second contest, which was with the water.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[168:3](sbe0550.htm#fr_956) The ninth lunar
mansion (see Bund. II, 3, VII, 1).

<span id="fn_951"></span>[169:1](sbe0550.htm#fr_957) Bund. VII, 2-6 is
paraphrased in §§ 2-6.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[169:2](sbe0550.htm#fr_958) Reading neksûnd
barâ min khasandakânŏ instead of the MS. barâ nasûnd min khasandakânŏ.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[169:3](sbe0550.htm#fr_959) Compare Bund. XIII,
1, 2.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[170:1](sbe0550.htm#fr_960) Bund. XIII, 2 has
1700, but as neither number is a multiple of forty in round numbers, it
is probable that both are wrong, and that we ought to read 1600.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[170:2](sbe0550.htm#fr_961) Bund. VII, 7-4 is
paraphrased in §§ 9-14.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[170:3](sbe0550.htm#fr_962) The Av.
aokhtô-nâmana yasna of Tî*s*tar Yt. II, 23; 24.

<span id="fn_957"></span>[171:1](sbe0550.htm#fr_963) Or perhaps 'made
the cloud rain,' if madam vârânînî*d* stands for a*v*ar vârânînî*d*.

<span id="fn_958"></span>[171:2](sbe0550.htm#fr_964) Reading partâ*v*
instead of the MS. patûtâ*v*, 'powerful fury.'

<span id="fn_959"></span>[171:3](sbe0550.htm#fr_965) This is a variant
of the *S*ahî-bûn or *G*âhî-bûn of Bund. XIII, 7, 15; the other two
names differ but little from those given in Bund. XIII. In the MS.
Pûîtîk occurs once, and Puîtîk twice.

<span id="fn_960"></span>[171:4](sbe0550.htm#fr_966) Compare §§ 15-18
with Bund. XIII, 8-14.

<span id="fn_961"></span>[171:5](sbe0550.htm#fr_967) Compare Bund. XIII,
1.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[172:1](sbe0550.htm#fr_968) This, is even a
more mechanical theory of the tides than that detailed in Bund. XIII,
13,. Whether the 'curving tails' (ga*g*ak dunbak) are the 'horns' of the
crescent moon is uncertain.

<span id="fn_963"></span>[172:2](sbe0550.htm#fr_969) By an accidental
transposition of letters the MS. has âtarô, 'fire,' instead of vâtô,
'wind.'

<span id="fn_964"></span>[172:3](sbe0550.htm#fr_970) The ocean and three
principal seas.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[172:4](sbe0550.htm#fr_971) Said to be
twenty-three in number in Bund. XIII, 6.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[172:5](sbe0550.htm#fr_972) Bund. VII, 15, 16,
XX, 1.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[172:6](sbe0550.htm#fr_973) This appears to be
a later identification of the Arag, Arang, or Arêng river of Bund. XX
with the Tigris, under its name Arvand, which is also found in the
Bahman Ya*s*t (III, 21, 38) and the Âfrîn of the Seven Ameshaspends (§
9). The Bundahi*s* (XX, 8) seems to connect the Arag (Araxes?) with the
Oxus and Nile, and describes the Diglat or Tigris as a distinct river
(Bund. XX, 12). This difference is one of the indications of the
Bundahi*s* having been so old a book in the time of Zâ*d*-sparam that he
sometimes misunderstood its meaning, which could hardly have been the
case if it had been written by one of his contemporaries. As the Persian
empire has several times included part of Egypt, the Nile must have then
been well known to the Persians as the great western river of their
world. The last time they had possession of part of Egypt was, for about
half a century, in the reigns of Khusrô <span id="page_173">p.
173</span> Nôshirvân, Aûharmazd IV, and Khusrô Parvîz; but since the
early part of the seventh century the Tigris has practically been their
extreme western limit; hence the change of the old Arag or Arang into
the very similarly written Arvand, a name of the Tigris.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[173:1](sbe0550.htm#fr_974) See Bund. XX, 9.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[173:2](sbe0550.htm#fr_975) Bund. XX, 2, 7.

Bund. XVII. 7, and Gû*s*nâsp in B. Yt. III, 30, 40, while the older form
Vi*s*nâsp occurs in B.Yt. III, 10.
