<p>country becomes more flourishing and more dominant in the world.</p>  
<p>6. The twenty-two stanzas of T&acirc;-v<I>e</I>-urv&acirc;t&acirc; (Yas.

<p>17. The six stanzas of Ahy&acirc;-thw&acirc;-&acirc;thr&ocirc; (Yas, XXXVI) are owing to the six hot ordeals (var) which, in the H&ucirc;sp&acirc;ram <I>Nask</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1800"></A><A HREF="#fn_1788"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, are effected by <I>k</I>athray&acirc;im &acirc;thrai&atilde;m&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1801"></A><A HREF="#fn_1789"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>28. The twenty stanzas of Ta<I>d</I>-thw&acirc;-peres&acirc; (Yas.

The term G&acirc;tha or 'hymn' (Pahl. g&acirc;s) is applied, in this chapter, not only to the five G&acirc;thas properly so called, but also to the Yasna of seven chapters, and apparently to <A NAME="page_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A> other portions of the Yasna written in the G&acirc;tha dialect of the Avesta.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1759"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1771">354:4</A> The five G&acirc;thas are the Ahunavaiti (Yas. XXVIII-XXXIV), the U<I>s</I>tavaiti (Yas.

<P><A NAME="fn_1760"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1772">354:5</A> This is the Pahlavi form of the Parsi navaz&ucirc;di, a term applied to the whole initiatory ceremonial of a n&ocirc;n&acirc;bar, or newly initiated priest; the term evidently implies that the ceremony is considered somewhat in the light of 'regeneration.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1763"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1775">355:1</A> These first three chapters of the Ahunavaiti collection of hymns are here supposed to symbolize the three material elements, whose union distinguishes a man's body from inorganic substances; while the eleven stanzas, which each of these chapters contains, symbolize the eleven immaterial existences said to be contained in the same body.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1764"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1776">355:2</A> This is doubtful, as no verb is expressed, and, the word b&acirc;r, 'time,' is struck out in M6, so it is possible to read 'the "three foremost" of the Ashem-Ahurem-mazd&atilde;m are the coming of H&ucirc;sh&ecirc;<I>d</I>ar,' &amp;c. The 'three foremost' (3 lev&icirc;n&#335;g) would be a possible Pahlavi translation of the Av. ti<I>s</I>r&ocirc; paoiry&ocirc; and ti<I>s</I>ra paoirya of Visp. XV, 4-6, instead of the actual 'three first' (3-i frat&ucirc;m), as may be seen from Pahl. Visp. VIII, 17, 20, where both p&ecirc;<I>s</I> (= lev&icirc;n&#335;) and frat&ucirc;m are used indifferently for Av. paoiry&ocirc;. At any rate the idea embodied in the text is that these 'three first' have some reference to the three future apostles of the Parsi religion (see Bund. XXXII, 8, B. Yt. III, 13, 44, 52, 62). In fact, however, they seem to refer to the first three chapters of the Ahunavaiti G&acirc;tha, immediately after which this chapter (Visp. XV) is recited in the full Parsi ritual; the phrase being rendered in the Pahlavi translation thus:&#151;'I reverence the three first by not speaking out, that is, I do not say anything during them, and not wearing out, that is, I do not doze away during them.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1779"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1791">358:6</A> This first stanza of the Ahunavaiti G&acirc;tha is recited twice, not only in its proper place (as the first stanza of each chapter is, in the G&acirc;thas), but also at the end of every chapter of the Ahunavaiti G&acirc;tha, while the officiating priest sprinkles the sacred twigs with the sacred milk or g&acirc;u<I>s</I> <I>g</I>&icirc;vya, 'living-cow produce' (see Haug's Essays, pp. 405, 406).</P>

This last clause, which is omitted in M6, connects these later hymns with the four classes of the community (see &sect; 9), just as the five older hymns are connected with the five chiefs of the community (see &sect; 11) in the former clauses. This section may be a translation from the Avesta, as the verbs precede their nominatives.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1787"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1799">360:2</A> That is, the beginning of the Yasna of seven chapters.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1789"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1801">360:4</A> These Avesta words are evidently corrupt, but perhaps 'a quadruple fire' is meant. K20 has <I>k</I>athr&acirc;y&acirc;im &acirc;thrai&atilde;m.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1791"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1803">361:1</A> The verb is probably omitted by mistake, and we ought to read 'voids urine upon it,' in accordance with Vend. III, 20.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1796"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1808">362:1</A> M6 has gair&icirc;, 'in a song,' with the obsolete g, which is very like s, and is also used in the word gar&ocirc; in &sect; 22; this is a variant well worth consideration by translators of the Avesta. K20 has only Ashahy&acirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1797"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1809">362:2</A> This formula (see B. Yt.

<P><A NAME="fn_1817"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1829">365:3</A> It seems probable that the Pahlavi writer has here confounded Spendamat, 'the beneficent spirit,' with the archangel Spendarma<I>d</I> who has special charge of the earth; their names being even more alike in Pahlavi than in English, though corrupted from the distinct Avesta forms spe<I>n</I>ta mainyu and spe<I>n</I>ta &acirc;rmaiti, respectively.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1824"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1836">366:2</A> Some words are evidently lost here; M6 has m followed by a blank space, and K20 has madam, 'on.' It is not quite certain whether the things mentioned are to be reckoned as four, five, or six; but assuming they are five, it is possible that the four things missing in the text are the four remaining chieftainships (see &sect; 11), the rulerships of the house, village, tribe, and province lodged in the rulers of the same respectively.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1834"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1846">367:5</A> M6 has 'of the soul,' which is, no doubt, a blunder due to the illegibility of the MS. from which it was copied.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1835"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1847">367:6</A> This is the Fsh&ucirc;sh&ocirc;-m&atilde;thra ('a spell or prayer for prosperity.') Of Visp. I, 28, II, 30, Yas. LVI, ix, 6, LVIII, 13. Whether the remainder of Yas. LVII is to be considered as pertaining to the G&acirc;thas is uncertain; it is recited in seven sections by the assistant priest, each section from a different position; these seven positions being the stations of the seven assistant priests who are supposed to be present spiritually, and to be arranged three on each side, and one at the south end, of the ceremonial area, while the chief officiating priest occupies the north end (see Haug's Essays, p. 332).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1836"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1848">368:1</A> The numbers of the stanzas and lines are correct, as may be seen from the details given in &sect; 51. Regarding the words there is the uncertainty as to what constitutes a compound word, but, taking each compound in Westergaard's edition of the texts as a single word, the total number of words in the 1016 lines is about 6147; and this could be reduced to 5567 only by omitting the Yasna of seven chapters, and somewhat relaxing the rule as to compound words. The meaning of the last two terms, m&acirc;rik and kh&ucirc;r<I>d</I>ak, is doubtful, but they are certainly not syllables and letters, as the number of syllables exceeds 13,000. In other places (see Bund. I, 21) m&acirc;rik usually means 'a word,' but that meaning is expressed by the term v&acirc;<I>k</I>ak here. If the number 9999 be correct, m&acirc;r&icirc;k must signify some particular class of syllable which would include about three-fourths of the whole number of syllables. It may be noted, however, that Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam, in the particulars he gives about the G&acirc;thas (see SZS. XI, 10, note 6), states the number of m&acirc;r&icirc;k at 6666. The kh&ucirc;r<I>d</I>ak or 'small' things are probably the consonants.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1837"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1849">369:1</A> All MSS. have 'four,' and then add the exception about Ith&acirc;-i to the account of this G&acirc;tha, instead of mentioning it in the details of the Vahi<I>s</I>t&ocirc;i<I>s</I>ti; which blunder is here corrected.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1838"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1850">369:2</A> Reading kadmon yehev&ucirc;ni<I>s</I>n&#335;, but the latter word, with part of the ciphers which follow, is torn away in K20, and in M6 it is written so as to resemble the Avesta letters gnn&nbsp;gnn, which are unintelligible, though something like Pahl. yehev&ucirc;ni<I>s</I>n&#335;; there can, however, be little doubt as to the general meaning of the phrase.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1839"></A><A HREF="sbe0573.htm#fr_1851">369:3</A> The number of lines is easily computed from the same details, as follows:&#151;300 + 120 + 329 + 164 + 66 + 37 = 1016 lines, as stated in &sect; 50, and as they still exist in the G&acirc;tha texts.</P>
