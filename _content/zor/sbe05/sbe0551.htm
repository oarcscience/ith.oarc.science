<p>1. And as he (Aharman) came thirdly to the earth, which arrayed the whole earth against him&#151;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A></p>  
<p>since <I>there was</I> an animation of the earth through the shattering&#151;Alb&ucirc;r<I>z</I> grew up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_981"></A><A HREF="#fn_975"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which is the boundary of the earth, <I>and</I> the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_982"></A><A HREF="#fn_976"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> mountains, which are amid the circuit of the earth, come up 2244 in number&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_983"></A><A HREF="#fn_977"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 2. And by them the earth <I>was</I> bound together and arranged, and on them <I>was</I> the sprouting and growth of plants, wherefrom <I>was</I> the nourishment of cattle, and therefrom was the great advantage of assistance to men.</p>  
<p>3. Even so it is declared that before the coming of the destroyer to the creatures, for a thousand years the substance of mountains was created in the earth&#151;especially as antagonism came on the earth, <I>and</I> settled on <I>it</I> with injury&#151;<I>and</I> it came up over the earth just like a tree <I>whose</I> branch <I>has</I> grown at the top, and its root at the bottom. 4. The root of the mountains is passed on <I>from</I> one to the other, <I>and</I> is arranged in connection <I>with them</I>, and through it is produced the path <I>and</I> passage of water <I>from</I> below to above, so that the water may flow in it in such manner as blood in the veins, from all <I>parts</I> of the body to the heart, the latent vigour which they possess. 5. And, moreover, in six hundred years&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_984"></A><A HREF="#fn_978"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, at first, all the mountains apart from Alb&ucirc;r<I>z</I> were completed. 6. Alb&ucirc;r<I>z</I> was growing during eight hundred years&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_985"></A><A HREF="#fn_979"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; in two hundred years it grew up to</p>

<p>the star station, in two hundred years up to the moon station, two hundred years up to the sun station, <I>and</I> two hundred years up to the sky. 7. After Alb&ucirc;r<I>z</I> the Apars&ecirc;n mountain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_986"></A><A HREF="#fn_980"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is the greatest, as it is also called the Avar-r&ocirc;yi<I>s</I>n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_987"></A><A HREF="#fn_981"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (up-growth') mountain, whose beginning is in Sagast&acirc;n and its end unto P&acirc;rs and to <I>K</I>&icirc;n&icirc;st&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_988"></A><A HREF="#fn_982"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>8. This, too, is declared, that after the great rain in the beginning of the creation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_989"></A><A HREF="#fn_983"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> the wind's sweeping away the water to the ocean, the earth is in seven portions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_990"></A><A HREF="#fn_984"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, a little above <I>it</I>, as the compact earth, after the rain, is torn up by the noise and wind <I>in</I> various places. 9. One portion, moreover, as much as one-half the whole earth, is in the middle, and in <I>each of</I> the six portions around is as much as Sagast&acirc;n; moreover, as much as Sagast&acirc;n is the measure <I>of what</I> is called a keshvar ('region') for the reason that one was defined from the other by a k&ecirc;sh ('furrow'). 10. The middle <I>one</I> is Khvan&icirc;ras, of which P&acirc;rs is the centre, and those six regions are like a coronet (a<I>v</I>&icirc;sar) <I>around it</I>. 11. One part of the wide-formed ocean wound around it, among those six regions; the sea and forest seized upon the south side, <I>and</I> a lofty mountain grew up on the north, so that they might become separate, one from the other, <I>and</I> imperceptible.</p>  
<p>12. This is the third contest, about the earth.</p>
