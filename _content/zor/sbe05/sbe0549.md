### CHAPTER V.

When in like manner, and equally oppressively, as his (Aûharmazd's)
creatures were disfigured, then through that same deterioration his own
great glory was exhibited; for as he came within the sky <span
id="fr_949"></span>[1](#fn_943) he maintains the spirit of the sky, like
an intrepid warrior who has put on metal armour <span
id="fr_950"></span>[2](#fn_944); and the sky in its fortress <span
id="fr_951"></span>[3](#fn_945) spoke these hasty, deceitful words to
Aharman, thus: 'Now when thou shalt have come in I *will* not let thee
back;' *and* it obstructed *him* until Aûharmazd prepared another
rampart, that is stronger, around the sky, *which* is called 'righteous
understanding' (ashôk âkâsîh). 2. And he arranged the guardian
spirits <span id="fr_952"></span>[4](#fn_946) of the righteous who are
warriors around that rampart, mounted on horses and spear in hand, in
such manner as the hair on the head; and they acquired the appearance of
prison guards who watch a prison from outside, and would not surrender
the outer boundaries *to* an enemy descended from the inside.

3\. Immediately, Aharman endeavours that he may go back to his own
complete darkness, but he found no passage; and he recapitulated, with
seeming misgiving, his fears of the worthiness which is to arise at the
appearance of the renovation *of the universe* at the end of the nine
thousand years.

4\. As it is said in the Gâthas, thus <span
id="fr_953"></span>[5](#fn_947): 'So also

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

both those spirits have approached together unto that which was the
first creation—that is, both spirits have come to the body of
Gâyômar*d*. Whatever is in life *is so* through this purpose of
Aûharmazd, that is: So that I may keep it alive; whatever is in
lifelessness *is so* through this purpose <span
id="fr_954"></span>[1](#fn_948) of the evil spirit, that is: So that I
may utterly destroy it; and whatever is thus, is so until the last in
the world, so that they (both spirits) come also on to the rest of
mankind. And on account of the utter depravity of the wicked *their*
destruction is fully seen, *and* so is the perfect meditation of him who
is righteous, the hope of the eternity of Aûharmazd.'

5\. And this was the first contest <span
id="fr_955"></span>[2](#fn_949), *that of* the sky with Aharman.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_943"></span>[167:1](sbe0549.htm#fr_949) See Chap. III, 2.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[167:2](sbe0549.htm#fr_950) Compare Bund. VI,
2.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[167:3](sbe0549.htm#fr_951) Or 'zodiacal
signs,' for bûr*g*ŏ means both.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[167:4](sbe0549.htm#fr_952) Bund. VI, 3, 4.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[167:5](sbe0549.htm#fr_953) This quotation from
the Gâthas is from the Pahlavi Yas. XXX, 4, and agrees with the Pahlavi
text, given in Dastûr <span id="page_168">p. 168</span> Jâmâspji's old
MS. of the Yasna in Bombay, very nearly as closely as Spiegel's edition
does. It appears, therefore, that Dâ*d*-sparam used the same Pahlavi
translation of the Yasna as the Parsis do at the present day.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[168:1](sbe0549.htm#fr_954) The MS. here omits
the words 'through this purpose,' by mistake.

<span id="fn_949"></span>[168:2](sbe0549.htm#fr_955) The word âr*d*îk,
which Dâ*d*-sparam uses instead of the kharah, 'conflict,' of Bund. V,
6, VI, 1, &c., may be connected with Pers. ârd, 'anger.'
