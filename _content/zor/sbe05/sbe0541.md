### CHAPTER XXXII <span id="fr_819"></span>[6](#fn_814)

1\. On the kindred of Pôrûshasp <span id="fr_820"></span>[7](#fn_815),
*son* of Paîtirâsp <span id="fr_821"></span>[8](#fn_816), *son* of
Aurvadasp <span id="fr_822"></span>[9](#fn_817), *son* of
Hâê*k*a*d*âsp <span id="fr_823"></span>[10](#fn_818), *son* of

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
*K*akhshnû*s* <span id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_819), *son* of Pâîtîrasp,
*son* of Hardar*s*n <span id="fr_825"></span>[2](#fn_820), *son* of
Hardâr <span id="fr_826"></span>[3](#fn_821), *son* of Spîtâmân <span
id="fr_827"></span>[4](#fn_822), *son* of Vîda*s*t <span
id="fr_828"></span>[5](#fn_823), *son* of Ayazem, *son* of Ra*g*an <span
id="fr_829"></span>[6](#fn_824), *son* of Dûrâsrôb <span
id="fr_830"></span>[7](#fn_825), *son* of Mânû*sk*îhar <span
id="fr_831"></span>[8](#fn_826). 2. As Paîtirâsp *had* two sons, one
Pôrûshasp *and* one Ârâsti <span id="fr_832"></span>[9](#fn_827), by
Pôrûshasp was Zaratû*s*t begotten for a sanctuary of good religion <span
id="fr_833"></span>[10](#fn_828), *and* by Ârâsti was Mê*d*yôk-mâh <span
id="fr_834"></span>[11](#fn_829) begotten. 3. Zaratû*s*t, when he
brought the religion, first celebrated

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

worship <span id="fr_835"></span>[1](#fn_830) *and* expounded in
Aîrân-vê*g*, and Mê*d*yôk-mâh received the religion from him. 4. The
Môbads <span id="fr_836"></span>[2](#fn_831) of Pârs are all *traced*
back to this race of Mânû*sk*îhar.

5\. Again, I say, by Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_837"></span>[3](#fn_832)
*were* begotten three sons and three daughters <span
id="fr_838"></span>[4](#fn_833); one *son was* Isa*d*vâstar <span
id="fr_839"></span>[5](#fn_834), one Aûrvata*d*-nar <span
id="fr_840"></span>[6](#fn_835), *and* one Khûrshê*d*-*k*îhar <span
id="fr_841"></span>[7](#fn_836); as Isa*d*vâstar *was* chief of the
priests he became the Môbad of Môbads, *and* passed away in the
hundredth year of the religion; Aûrvata*d*-nar *was* an agriculturist,
*and* the chief of the enclosure formed by Yim <span
id="fr_842"></span>[8](#fn_837), which is below the earth;
Khûrshê*d*-*k*îhar *was* a warrior, commander of the army of Pêshyôtanû,
*son* of Vi*s*tâsp, *and* dwells in Kangde*z* <span
id="fr_843"></span>[8](#fn_837); *and* of the three daughters the name
of one was Frên, of one Srît, *and* of one Pôru*k*îst <span
id="fr_844"></span>[9](#fn_838). 6. Aûrvata*d*-nar and
Khûrshê*d*-*k*îhar were from a serving (*k*akar) wife <span
id="fr_845"></span>[10](#fn_839), the rest were from a privileged
(pâ*d*akhshah) wife.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 7 <span
id="fr_846"></span>[1](#fn_840). By Isa*d*vâstar was begotten a son
*whose* name was Ururvi*g*a <span id="fr_847"></span>[2](#fn_841), and
they call him Aran*g*-i Bîrâ*d*ân <span id="fr_848"></span>[3](#fn_842)
('fore-arm of brothers') for this reason, that, as they

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

were from a serving wife, *she* then delivered them over to Isa*d*vâstar
through adoption. 8. This, too, *one* knows, that three sons of
Zaratû*s*t, *namely*, Hûshê*d*ar, Hûshê*d*ar-mâh <span
id="fr_849"></span>[1](#fn_843), and Sôshyans <span
id="fr_850"></span>[2](#fn_844), were from Hvôv <span
id="fr_851"></span>[3](#fn_845); as it says, that Zaratû*s*t went near
unto Hvôv three times, *and* each time the seed went to the ground; the
angel Nêryôsang <span id="fr_852"></span>[4](#fn_846) received the
brilliance and strength of that seed, delivered *it* with care to the
angel Anâhî*d* <span id="fr_853"></span>[5](#fn_847), *and* in time will
blend *it* with a mother. 9. Nine thousand, nine hundred, and
ninety-nine, and nine myriads <span id="fr_854"></span>[6](#fn_848) of
the guardian spirits of the righteous are intrusted with *its*
protection, so that the demons may not injure *it* <span
id="fr_855"></span>[7](#fn_849).

10\. The name of the mother of Zaratû*s*t was Dughdâ <span
id="fr_856"></span>[8](#fn_850), *and* the name of the father of the
mother, of Zaratû*s*t was Frahimravâ <span
id="fr_857"></span>[9](#fn_851).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_814"></span>[140:6](sbe0541.htm#fr_819) This chapter, which
is numbered XXXIII, by previous translators, is found in all MSS., but

TD.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[140:10](sbe0541.htm#fr_823) Av. Haê*k*a*d*aspa

<span id="fn_820"></span>[141:2](sbe0541.htm#fr_825) K20 has Pâz.
Har*s*n and TD has Harakî*d*ârsnŏ.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[141:3](sbe0541.htm#fr_826) TD has Harâî*d*âr,
or Arâî*d*âr.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[141:4](sbe0541.htm#fr_827) Or Spîtâm (as the
last syllable is the patronymical suffix), Av. Spitâma, the usual
patronymic of Zaratû*s*t.

<span id="fn_823"></span>[141:5](sbe0541.htm#fr_828) May be read
Vâdi*s*t in TD.

<span id="fn_824"></span>[141:6](sbe0541.htm#fr_829) Possibly the same
person as Râk in Chap. XXXI, 31; but see XXXIII, 3.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[141:7](sbe0541.htm#fr_830) So in TD, but Pâz.
Durâsrun in K20, M6.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[141:8](sbe0541.htm#fr_831) This genealogy is
somewhat differently given in the Va*g*arkar*d*-i Dînîk (pp. 28, 29), as
published in Bombay by Dastur Peshotanji Behramji Sanjânâ in 1848; and
is extended back, through the generations mentioned in Chap. XXXI, 1, 2,
7, 14, to Gâyômar*d*, as follows: 'Pôrûshâspô *son* of Paîtîrâsp, *and*
Arâspô son of Paîtîrâsp, Urva*n*dasp, Haê*k*a*d*asp, *K*ikhshnu*s*,

all mankind in the material world.'

<span id="fn_827"></span>[141:9](sbe0541.htm#fr_832) Av. Âkrâstaya of
Fravardîn Yt. 95; TD has Ârâstih.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[141:10](sbe0541.htm#fr_833) The Pâzand words
dargâ hidaini*s* appear to be merely a misreading of Pahl. dargâs-i
hûdînôîh.

<span id="fn_829"></span>[141:11](sbe0541.htm#fr_834) Av.
Maidhyô-m*a*ungha of Yas. L, 19, Fravardîn Yt. 95, 106. He is said to
have been Zaratû*s*t's first disciple.

<span id="fn_830"></span>[142:1](sbe0541.htm#fr_835) Reading frâ*g*
ya*s*t; but it may be frâ*g* ga*s*t, 'wandered forth.'

<span id="fn_831"></span>[142:2](sbe0541.htm#fr_836) The class of
priests whose special duty is to perform all religious rites and
ceremonies.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[142:3](sbe0541.htm#fr_837) This paragraph is
quoted, with a few alterations, in the Va*g*arkar*d*-i Dînîk, pp. 21-23.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[142:4](sbe0541.htm#fr_838) K20 omits the
'three daughters' here, by mistake.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[142:5](sbe0541.htm#fr_839) Av. Isa*d*-vâstra
of Yas. XXIII, 4, XXVI, 17, Fravardîn Yt. 98.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[142:6](sbe0541.htm#fr_840) Av. Urvata*d*-nara
of Vend. II, 143, Fravardîn Yt. 98. K20 and A16 have Aûrvarta*d*-nar,
and TD has Aûrvâta*d*-nar.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[142:7](sbe0541.htm#fr_841) Av. Hvare-*k*ithra
of Fravardîn Yt. 98; TD has Khûr-*k*îhar.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[142:8](sbe0541.htm#fr_843) See Chap. XXIX, 5.
Windischmann and Justi consider the clause about Pêshyôtanû as inserted
by mistake, and it is omitted in the Va*g*arkar*d*-i Dînîk (p. 21); it
is found, however, in all MSS. of the Bundahi*s*.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[142:9](sbe0541.htm#fr_844) These daughters are
the Av. Fr*e*ni, Thriti, and Pouru-*k*ista of Fravardîn Yt. 139; the
last is also mentioned in Yas. LII, 3.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[142:10](sbe0541.htm#fr_845) The following is a
summary of the Persian descriptions of the five kinds of marriage, as
given in the Rivâyats:—

A pâdshâh ('ruling, or privileged') wife is when a man marries, <span
id="page_143">p. 143</span> with the parents' consent, an unbetrothed
maiden out of a family, and she and her children remain his in both
worlds.

A yûkan or ayûk ('only child') wife is an only child, married with the
parents’ consent, and her first child belongs to them; after its birth
she becomes a pâdshâh wife. She is entitled to one-third of her parents'
property for giving up the child.

A satar ('adopted') wife is when a man over fifteen years of age dies
childless and unmarried, and his relatives provide a maiden with a
dowry, and marry her to another man; when half her children belong to,
the dead man, and half to the living, and she herself is the dead man's
wife in the other world.

A *k*akar or *k*âkar ('serving') wife is a widow who marries again; if
she had no children by her first husband she is acting as a satar wife,
and half her children by her second husband belong to her first one; and
she herself, in any case, belongs to her first husband in the other
world.

A khûd-*s*arâî or khûd-sarâî ('self-disposing') wife is one who marries
without her parents’ consent; she inherits no property from her parents
until her eldest son has given her as a pâdshâh wife to his father.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[143:1](sbe0541.htm#fr_846) Instead of this
sentence the Va*g*arkar*d*-i Dînîk (pp. 21, 22) has the following, which
appears to rest upon a misinterpretation of the text:—

'And Zaratû*s*t the righteous had three wives; all three were in the
lifetime of Zaratû*s*t, and all three wives were living throughout the
lifetime of Zaratû*s*t; the name of one was Hvôv, of the second Urvi*g*,
of the third Arni*g*-baredâ. And from Urvi*g*, who was a privileged
wife, four children were born; one was the son Isa*d*vâstar, and the
three daughters, namely, Frên, Srîtak, and Pôru*k*ist; these four were
from Urvi*g*. And from the wife Arni*g*-baredâ two sons were born, one
Aûrvart-nar, and the second Khûrshêd-*k*îhar; and Arni*g*-baredâ was a
serving wife, and the name of the former husband of Arni*g*-baredâ was
Mitrô-ayâr. And from Hvôv, who was a privileged wife, *were* three sons,
namely, Hûshê*d*ar, Hûshê*d*ar-mâh, and Sôshâns, as it says,' &c. (as in
§ 8).

<span id="fn_841"></span>[143:2](sbe0541.htm#fr_847) TD has Pahl.
Aûrvarvî*g*ak or Khûrûrûpak.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[143:3](sbe0541.htm#fr_848) So in TD.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[144:1](sbe0541.htm#fr_849) Av.
Ukhshya*d*-ereta and Ukhshya*d*-nemangh of Fravardîn Yt. 128.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[144:2](sbe0541.htm#fr_850) Av. Saoshyãs of
Vend. XIX, 18, Fravardîn Yt. 129, &c. See Chaps. XI, 6, XXIX, 6, XXX, 3,
4, 7, 17, 25, 27.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[144:3](sbe0541.htm#fr_851) Av. Hvôvi of
Fravardîn Yt. 139, Dîn Yt. 15; the Pahlavi form of the name, as given
once in TD, is Hûvâôbŏ.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[144:4](sbe0541.htm#fr_852) See Chap. XV, 1.

<span id="fn_847"></span>[144:5](sbe0541.htm#fr_853) Av. anâhita of Âbân
Yt. 1, &c.; a female personification of 'unsullied' water, known
generally by the epithet ardvî sûra (the Arêdvîvsûr of Chap. XIII), and
whose name is also applied to the planet Venus (see Chap. V, 1).

<span id="fn_848"></span>[144:6](sbe0541.htm#fr_854) So in M6; other
MSS. have '9,999 myriads,' but see Fravardîn Yt. 62.

<span id="fn_849"></span>[144:7](sbe0541.htm#fr_855) This last phrase,
about the demons, is omitted in TD and the Va*g*arkar*d*-i Dînîk.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[144:8](sbe0541.htm#fr_856) The Avesta word for
'daughter.'

<span id="fn_851"></span>[144:9](sbe0541.htm#fr_857) TD has Pâz.
Fereâhimruvânâ.
