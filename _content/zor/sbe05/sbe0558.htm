They recount largely about duties and good works, and pursue wickedness and the road to hell; and through the iniquity, cajolery, and craving of wrath and avarice they rush to hell.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1050"></A><A HREF="sbe0558.htm#fr_1057">195:4</A> The verb is placed before its nominative in the Pahlavi text, both here and in most similar sentences, which is an imitation of the Avesta, due probably to the text being originally translated from an Avesta book now lost, or, at any rate, to its author's wish that it might appear to be so translated. In such cases of inverted construction, when the verb is in a past tense, the Pahlavi idiom often requires a pronominal suffix, corresponding, to the nominative, to be added to the first word in the sentence; thus, g&ucirc;ft&#335;<I>s</I> A&ucirc;harmazd, or afa<I>s</I> g&ucirc;ft A&ucirc;harmazd, does not mean 'A&ucirc;harmazd spoke to him (or said it),' but merely 'A&ucirc;harmazd spoke' (lit. 'it was said by him, A&ucirc;harmazd').</P>

Their names, as written in SZS., may be read as follows, 'Br&acirc;<I>d</I>arvakhsh, Br&acirc;<I>d</I>r&ocirc;yi<I>s</I>n&#335;, T&ucirc;r Br&acirc;gr&ecirc;sh, Az&acirc;n&#335;, and Nasm,' and the first is also called 'T&ucirc;r-i 'Br&acirc;<I>d</I>arvakhsh;' they are described as descendants of the sister of Man&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har. In the seventh book of the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I>d a wizard, who endeavours to injure Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t in his childhood, is called 'T&ucirc;r-i Br&acirc;<I>d</I>r&ocirc;k-r&ecirc;sh, the Karap&#335;,' and was probably the third brother, whose name (thus corrected) indicates br&acirc;thr&ocirc;-ra&ecirc;sha as its Avesta form. Karap or Karap&acirc;n in all these passages is evidently the name of a family or caste, probably the Av. karapan&ocirc; which Haug translates by 'performers of (idolatrous) sacrificial rites,' in connection with Sans. kalpa, 'ceremonial ritual' (see Haug's Essays, pp. 289-291).</P>

The Sasanian inscriptions confirm the reading afa<I>s</I> for the conjunctive form; and N&ecirc;ry&ocirc;sang, the learned Parsi translator of Pahlavi texts into P&acirc;zand and Sanskrit some four centuries ago, was aware of the difference between the two forms, as he transcribes them correctly into Paz. va<I>s</I> and a<I>z</I>a<I>s</I>.</P>

This Valkha<I>s</I> was probably Vologeses I, a contemporary of Nero, as shown by Darmesteter in the introduction to his translation of the Vendidad.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1069"></A><A HREF="sbe0558.htm#fr_1076">200:1</A> I am indebted to Professor J. Darmesteter for pointing out that N&ecirc;ry&ocirc;sang, in his Sanskrit translation of Yas. IX, 75, explains Kala<I>s</I>iy&acirc;k&acirc;<I>h</I> as 'those whose faith is the Christian religion;' the original Pahlavi word in the oldest MSS. is Kilis&acirc;y&acirc;&icirc;k, altogether a misunderstanding of the Avesta name Keres&acirc;ni, which it translates, but sufficiently near the name in our text to warrant the assumption that N&ecirc;ry&ocirc;sang would have translated Kilisy&acirc;k&icirc;h by 'Christianity;' literally it means 'ecclesiasticism, or the church religion' (from Pers. kilisy&acirc;, Gr. &#7952;&#0954;&#0954;&#0955;&#0951;&#0963;&#8055;&#0945;). Akandgar is probably a miswriting of Alaksandar or Sikandar; though Darmesteter suggests that Skandgar (Av. ske<I>n</I>d&ocirc;-kara, Pers. <I>s</I>ikandgar), 'causer of destruction,' would be an appropriate punning title for Alexander from a Persian point of view. The anachronisms involved in making Alexander the Great a Christian, conquered by an A<I>s</I>k&acirc;nian king, are not more startling than the usual Pahlavi statement that he was a Roman. To a Persian in Sasanian times Alexander was the representative of an invading enemy which had come from the countries occupied, in those times, by the eastern empire of the Christian Romans, which enemy had been subdued in Persia by the A<I>s</I>k&acirc;nian dynasty; and such information would naturally lead to the anachronisms just mentioned. The name Kilisy&acirc;k&icirc;h is again used, in Chap. III, 3, 5, 8, to denote some Christian enemy.</P>

Originally, however, Av. magha appears to have meant a shallow hole dug in the earth, near or over which the person squatted upon a seat, either of stone or some other hard material (see Vend. IX). The term for the hole was probably extended to the whole arrangement, including the seat, which latter has thus acquired the name of magh, although magh and magh&acirc;k still mean 'a channel or pit' in Persian.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1115"></A><A HREF="sbe0558.htm#fr_1122">212:5</A> For the following explanation of the various kinds of h&ocirc;m&acirc;st I am indebted to Dast&ucirc;r J&acirc;m&acirc;spji Minochiharji J&acirc;m&acirc;sp-&Acirc;s&acirc;-n&acirc; of Bombay:&#151;</p>  
<p>There are four kinds of h&ocirc;m&acirc;st recited by priests for the atonement of any sin that may have been committed by a woman during menstruation, after her purification:&#151;</p>  
<p>1. H&ocirc;m&acirc;st consists of prayers recited for 144 days, in honour of the twelve following angels: A&ucirc;harmazd, T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar, Kh&ucirc;rsh&ecirc;d, M&acirc;h, &Acirc;b&acirc;n, &Acirc;dar, Khurd&acirc;d, Amerd&acirc;d, Spendarma<I>d</I>, B&acirc;d, Sr&ocirc;sh, and Ard&acirc;-fravash. Each angel, in turn, is reverenced for twelve days successively, with one Yasna each day.</p>  
<p>2. Khad&ucirc;k-h&ocirc;m&acirc;st, 'one h&ocirc;m&acirc;st,' differs from the last merely in adding a Vendidad every twelfth day, to be recited in the <A NAME="page_213"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 213</FONT></A> Ushahin G&acirc;h (12 P<I>M</I>. to 6 A<I>M</I>.) in honour of the angel whose propitiation ends that day.</p>  
<p>3. Dah-h&ocirc;m&acirc;st, 'ten h&ocirc;m&acirc;sts,' differs from the preceding merely in having a Vendidad, in addition to the Yasna, every day.</p>  
<p>4. Dv&acirc;zdah-h&ocirc;m&acirc;st, 'twelve h&ocirc;m&acirc;sts,' are prayers recited for 264 days in honour of twenty-two angels, namely. the twelve aforesaid and the following ten: Bahman, Ardibahi<I>s</I>t, Shahrivar, Mihir, Bahr&acirc;m, R&acirc;m, D&icirc;n, Rashn&ucirc;, G&ocirc;<I>s</I>, and &Acirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;d. Each angel, in turn, is reverenced as in the last.</p>  
<p>The celebration of h&ocirc;m&acirc;st costs 350 r&ucirc;p&icirc;s, that of khad&ucirc;k-h&ocirc;m&acirc;st 422 r&ucirc;p&icirc;s, that of dah-h&ocirc;m&acirc;st 1000 r&ucirc;p&icirc;s, and that of dv&acirc;zdah-h&ocirc;m&acirc;st 2000 r&ucirc;p&icirc;s; but the first and third are now no longer used. The merit obtained by having such recitations performed is equivalent to 1000 tan&acirc;p&ucirc;hars for each Yasna, 10,000 for each Visparad, and 70,000 for each Vendidad recited. A tan&acirc;p&ucirc;har is now considered as a weight of 1200 dirhams, with which serious sins and works of considerable merit are estimated; originally it must have meant a sin which was 'inexpiable' by ordinary good works, and, conversely, any extraordinary good work which was just sufficient to efface such a sin.</p>  
<p>The amount of merit attaching to such recitations is variously stated in different books, and when recited with holy-water (that is, with all their ceremonial rites) they are said to be usually a hundred times as meritorious as when recited without it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1116"></A><A HREF="sbe0558.htm#fr_1123">214:1</A> So in the P&acirc;zand, but 'seventeen' in Persian; in K20 the word is partly illegible, but can be no other number than <I>s</I>ib&acirc;, seven.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1117"></A><A HREF="sbe0558.htm#fr_1124">214:2</A> The mountainous region south of the Caspian (see Bund. XII, 2, 17).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1118"></A><A HREF="sbe0558.htm#fr_1125">214:3</A> This section is the Pahlavi version of an Avesta formula which is appended to nearly two-thirds of the h&acirc;s or chapters of the Yasna, and, therefore, indicates the close of the chapter at this point. The version here given contains a few verbal deviations from that given in the Yasna, but none of any importance. The Avesta text of this formula is as follows:&#151;</p>  
<p><DIR>Y&ecirc;<FONT SIZE="-1">N</FONT>h&ecirc; h&acirc;t&atilde;m &acirc;a<I>d</I>, y&ecirc;sn&ecirc; pait&icirc;<br> vangh&ocirc; mazd<I>a</I>u ahur&ocirc; va&ecirc;th&acirc;, ash&acirc;<I>d</I> ha<I>k</I>&acirc;,<br> y<I>a</I>ungh&atilde;m<I>k</I>&acirc;, t&atilde;s<I>k</I>&acirc; t<I>a</I>us<I>k</I>&acirc; yazamaid&ecirc;.</DIR></p>  
<p>And it may be translated in the following manner:&#151;</p>  
<p>'Of whatever male of the existences, therefore, Ahuramazda was better cognizant, through righteousness in worship, and of whatever females, both those males and those females we reverence.'</P>
