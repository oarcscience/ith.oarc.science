### CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. On the chieftainship of men and animals *and* every single thing it
says in revelation, that first of the human species Gâyômar*d* was
produced, brilliant and white, with eyes which looked out for the great
*one*, him who *was* here the Zaratû*s*trôtûm (chief high-priest); the
chieftainship of all things was from Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_479"></span>[1](#fn_475). 2. The white ass-goat <span
id="fr_480"></span>[2](#fn_476), which holds *its* head down, is the
chief of goats, the first of those species created <span
id="fr_481"></span>[3](#fn_477). 3. The black sheep which is fat and
white-jawed is the chief of sheep; it was the first of those species
created <span id="fr_482"></span>[3](#fn_477). 4. The camel with
white-haired knees *and* two humps is the chief of camels. 5. First the
black-haired ox with yellow knees was created; he is the chief of oxen.
6. First the dazzling white (arûs) horse, with yellow ears, glossy hair,
*and* white eyes, was produced; he is the chief of horses. 7. The white,
cat-footed <span id="fr_483"></span>[4](#fn_478) ass is the chief of
asses. 8. First of dogs the fair (arûs) dog with yellow hair was
produced; he is the chief of dogs. 9. The hare was produced brown

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (bûr); he is the
chief of the wide-travellers. 10. Those beasts which have no dread
whatever of the hand are evil. 11. First of birds the griffon of three
natures <span id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_479) was created, not for here
(this world), for the Kar*s*ipt <span id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_480) is
the chief, which they call the falcon (*k*ark), that which revelation
says was brought to the enclosure formed by Yim. 12. First of fur
animals the white ermine was produced; he is the chief of fur animals;
as it says that *it is* the white ermine which came unto the assembly of
the archangels. 13. The Kar-fish, *or* Ari*z* <span
id="fr_486"></span>[3](#fn_481), is the chief of the water-creatures.
14. The Dâîtîk <span id="fr_487"></span>[4](#fn_482) river is the chief
of streams. 15. The Dâra*g*a <span id="fr_488"></span>[5](#fn_483) river
is the chief of exalted rivers, for the dwelling of the father of
Zaratû*s*t was on its banks <span id="fr_489"></span>[6](#fn_484), *and*
Zaratû*s*t was born there. 16. The hoary forest <span
id="fr_490"></span>[7](#fn_485) is the chief of forests. 17. Hûgar the
lofty <span id="fr_491"></span>[8](#fn_486), on which the water of
Arêdvîvsûr flows *and* leaps, is the chief of summits, since *it is
that* above which is the revolution of the constellation Satavês <span
id="fr_492"></span>[9](#fn_487), the chief of

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

reservoirs <span id="fr_493"></span>[1](#fn_488). 18. The Hôm which is
out-squeezed is the chief of medicinal plants <span
id="fr_494"></span>[2](#fn_489). 19. Wheat is the chief of
large-seeded <span id="fr_495"></span>[3](#fn_490) grains. 20. The
desert wormwood is the chief of unmedicinal <span
id="fr_496"></span>[4](#fn_491) *plants*. 21. The summer vetch, which
they also call 'pag' (gâvirs), is the chief of small-seeded grains <span
id="fr_497"></span>[5](#fn_492). 22. The Kûstîk (sacred thread-girdle)
is the chief of clothes. 23. The Bâzâyvâna <span
id="fr_498"></span>[6](#fn_493) is the chief of seas. 24. Of two men,
when they come forward together, the wiser and more truthful is chief.

25\. This, too, it says in revelation, that Aûharmazd created the whole
material world one abode, so that all may be one; for there is much
splendour and glory of industry in the world. 26. Whatsoever he
performs, who practises that which is good, is the value of the water of
life <span id="fr_499"></span>[7](#fn_494); since water is not created
alike <span id="fr_500"></span>[8](#fn_495) in value, for the undefiled
water of Arêdvîvsûr is worth the whole water of the sky and earth of
Khvanîras <span id="fr_501"></span>[9](#fn_496), except the Arag
river <span id="fr_502"></span>[10](#fn_497), created by Aûharmazd. 27.
Of trees the myrtle *and* date,

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

on which *model*, it is said, trees were formed, are worth all the trees
of Khvanîras, except the Gôkar*d* tree <span
id="fr_503"></span>[1](#fn_498) with which they restore the dead.

28\. Of mountains Mount Apârsên's beginning is *in* Sagastân *and* end
in Khû*g*îstân, some say *it is* all the mountains of Pârs, *and* is
chief of all mountains except Albûr*z*. 29. Of birds *K*amrô*s* <span
id="fr_504"></span>[2](#fn_499) is chief, who is worth all the birds in
Khvanîras, except the griffon of three natures. 30. The conclusion is
this, that every one who performs a great duty has then much value.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_475"></span>[88:1](sbe0533.htm#fr_479) So in all MSS., but
by reading mûn, 'who,' instead of min, 'from,' we should have, 'him who
was here the chief high-priest and chieftainship of all things, who was
Zaratû*s*t.' The Pahlavi Visp. I. 1, gives the following list of chiefs:
'The chief of spirits is Aûharmazd, the chief of worldly existences is
Zaratû*s*t, the chief of water-creatures is the Kar-fish, the chief of
*land*-animals is the ermine, the chief of flying-creatures is the
Kar*s*ipt, the chief of the wide-travellers is the . . . , the chief of
those suitable for grazing is the ass-goat.'

<span id="fn_476"></span>[88:2](sbe0533.htm#fr_480) See Chap. XIV, 14.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[88:3](sbe0533.htm#fr_482) It is doubtful
whether the phrase, 'the first of those species created,' belongs to
this sentence or the following one.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[88:4](sbe0533.htm#fr_483) Or, 'cat-legged.'

<span id="fn_479"></span>[89:1](sbe0533.htm#fr_484) The Sîmurgh (see §
29 and Chap. XIV, 11, 23, 24). In Mkh. LXII, 37-39, it is mentioned as
follows: 'And Sînamrû's resting-place is on the tree which is opposed to
harm, of all seeds; and always when he rises aloft a thousand twigs will
shoot forth from that tree; and when he alights he will break off the
thousand twigs, and he sheds their seed therefrom.'

<span id="fn_480"></span>[89:2](sbe0533.htm#fr_485) See Chap. XIX, 16.
In § 29 *K*amrô*s* is said to be the chief.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[89:3](sbe0533.htm#fr_486) See Chaps. XIV, 12,
26, XVIII, 3-6.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[89:4](sbe0533.htm#fr_487) See Chap. XX, 13

<span id="fn_483"></span>[89:5](sbe0533.htm#fr_488) See Chap. XX, 32.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[89:6](sbe0533.htm#fr_489) The MSS. have 'in
Balkh' instead of 'on the banks.'

<span id="fn_485"></span>[89:7](sbe0533.htm#fr_490) The arûs-i razur is
the Av. spaêtitem razurem of Râm Yt. 31.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[89:8](sbe0533.htm#fr_491) See Chap. XII, 5.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[89:9](sbe0533.htm#fr_492) See Chap. II, 7.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[90:1](sbe0533.htm#fr_493) The meaning of Pâz.
gobarâ is doubtful, but it is here taken as standing for Pahl. gôbalân,
equivalent to the plural of Pers. gôl or kôl, 'a reservoir;' Satavês
being a specially 'watery' constellation (see Tî*s*tar Yt. 0). Justi
traces gobarân to Av. gufra, and translates it by 'protecting *stars*.'

<span id="fn_489"></span>[90:2](sbe0533.htm#fr_494) Pâz. khvad and
ba*k*agâ evidently stand for Pahl. hû*d* (Av. huta) and be*z*ashk.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[90:3](sbe0533.htm#fr_495) Compare Av.
as-dânunãm-*k*a yavananãm (Tî*s*tar Yt. 29).

<span id="fn_491"></span>[90:4](sbe0533.htm#fr_496) Pâz. aba*k*agâ
stands for Pahl. abe*z*ashk.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[90:5](sbe0533.htm#fr_497) Compare Av.
kasu-dânunãm-*k*a vâstranãm (Tî*s*tar Yt. 29).

<span id="fn_493"></span>[90:6](sbe0533.htm#fr_498) Justi identifies
this with Lake Van, but perhaps Lake Sevan may be meant.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[90:7](sbe0533.htm#fr_499) Or, 'its value is
water.' K20 omits the word 'water.'

<span id="fn_495"></span>[90:8](sbe0533.htm#fr_500) Reading ham instead
of hamâk, 'all.'

<span id="fn_496"></span>[90:9](sbe0533.htm#fr_501) See Chap. XI, 2-6.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[90:10](sbe0533.htm#fr_502) See Chap. XX, 8.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[91:1](sbe0533.htm#fr_503) See Chap. XVIII,
1-4.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[91:2](sbe0533.htm#fr_504) See Chap. XIX, 115,
where it is written *K*âmrô*s*. This § is at variance with § 11, which
gives the chieftainship to Kar*s*ipt.
