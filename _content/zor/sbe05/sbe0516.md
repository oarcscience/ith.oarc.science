### CHAPTER VII.

1\. The second conflict was waged with the water, because, as the star
Tî*s*tar *was* in Cancer, the water which is in the subdivision they
call Avrak <span id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_121) was

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

pouring, on the same day when the destroyer rushed in, *and* came again
into notice for mischief (âvârak) in the direction of the west. 2. For
every single month is the owner of one constellation; the month Tîr is
the fourth month <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122) of the year,
*and* Cancer the fourth constellation from Aries, so it is the owner of
Cancer, into which Tî*s*tar sprang, *and* displayed the characteristics
of a producer of rain; and he brought on the water aloft by the strength
of the wind. 3. Co-operators with Tî*s*tar were Vohûman and the angel
Hôm, with the assistance of the angel Bûr*g* and the righteous guardian
spirits in orderly arrangement.

4\. Tî*s*tar was converted into three forms, the form of a man and the
form of a horse and the form of a bull <span
id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_123); thirty days *and* nights he was
distinguished in brilliance <span id="fr_124"></span>[3](#fn_124), and
in each form he produced rain ten days *and* nights; as the astrologers
say that every constellation has three forms. 5. Every single drop of
that rain became as big as a bowl, and the water stood the height of a
man over the whole of this earth; *and* the noxious creatures on the
earth being all killed by the rain, went into the holes of the
earth <span id="fr_125"></span>[4](#fn_125).

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

6\. And, afterwards, the wind spirit, so that it may not be contaminated
(gûmîkht), stirs up the wind *and* atmosphere as the life stirs in the
body; and the water was all swept away by it, and was brought out to the
borders of the earth, and the wide-formed <span
id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126) ocean arose therefrom. 7. The noxious
creatures remained dead within the earth, and their venom and stench
were mingled with the earth, and in order to carry that poison away from
the earth Tî*s*tar went down into the ocean in the form of a white horse
with long hoofs <span id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_127).

8\. And Apâôsh <span id="fr_128"></span>[3](#fn_128), the demon, came
meeting him in the likeness of a black horse with clumsy (kund) hoofs; a
mile (parasang) <span id="fr_129"></span>[4](#fn_129) away from him fled
Tî*s*tar, through the fright which drove *him* away. 9. And Tî*s*tar
begged for success from Aûharmazd, and Aûharmazd gave *him* strength and
power, as it is said, that unto Tî*s*tar was brought at once the
strength of ten vigorous horses, ten vigorous camels, ten vigorous
bulls, ten mountains, and ten rivers <span
id="fr_130"></span>[5](#fn_130). 10. A mile away from him fled Apâôsh,
the demon, through fright at *his* strength; on account of this they
speak of an arrow-*shot* with Tî*s*tar's strength in the sense *of a
mile*.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

11\. Afterwards, with a cloud for a jar (khûmb)—thus they call the
measure which was a means of the work—he seized upon the water *and*
made it rain most prodigiously, in drops *like* bull's heads and men's
heads, pouring in handfuls *and* pouring in armfuls, both great and
small. 12. On the production of that rain the demons Aspen*g*argâk <span
id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_131) *and* Apâôsh contended *with it*, and
the fire Vâzist <span id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_132) turned *its* club
over; and owing to the blow of the club Aspen*g*argâk made a very
grievous noise, as even now, in a conflict with the producer of rain, a
groaning and raging <span id="fr_133"></span>[3](#fn_133) are manifest.
13. And ten nights and days rain was produced by him in that manner, and
the poison and venom of the noxious creatures which were in the earth
were, all mixed up in the water, and the water became quite salt,
because there remained in the earth *some* of those germs which noxious
creatures ever collect.

14\. Afterwards, the wind, in the same manner *as before*, restrained
the water, at the end of three days, on various sides of the earth; and
the three great seas *and* twenty-three small seas <span
id="fr_134"></span>[4](#fn_134) arose therefrom, *and* two fountains
(*k*ashmak) of the sea thereby became manifest, one the *K*ê*k*ast lake,
and one the Sôvbar <span id="fr_135"></span>[5](#fn_135), whose sources
are connected with the

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

fountain of the sea. 15. And at its north side <span
id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136) two rivers flowed out, *and* went one to
the east *and* one to the west; they are the Arag river and the Vêh
river; as it is said thus: 'Through those finger-breadth tricklings do
thou pour *and* draw forth two such waters, O Aûharmazd!' 16. Both those
rivers wind about through all the extremities of the earth, and
intermingle again with the water of the wide-formed ocean. 17. As those
two rivers flowed out, *and* from the same place of origin as theirs,
eighteen <span id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_137) navigable rivers flowed
out, and after the other waters have flowed out from those navigable
*streams* they all flow back to the Arag <span
id="fr_138"></span>[3](#fn_138) river and Vêh river, whose fertilization
(khvâpardârîh) of the world *arises* therefrom.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_121"></span>[25:3](sbe0516.htm#fr_121) The ninth lunar
mansion (see Chap. II, 3) corresponding with the middle of Cancer.
Tî*s*tar (Sirius) being in Cancer probably <span id="page_26">p.
26</span> means that it rises about the same time as the stars of
Cancer, as is actually the case.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[26:1](sbe0516.htm#fr_122) See Chap. XXV, 20.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[26:2](sbe0516.htm#fr_123) See Tî*s*tar Yt. 13,
16, 18, where it is stated that Tî*s*tar assumes the form of a man for
the first ten nights, of a bull for the second ten nights, and of a
horse for the third ten nights. Also in Vend. XIX, 126 Tî*s*tar is
specially invoked in his form of a bull.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[26:3](sbe0516.htm#fr_124) Or it may be
translated, 'he hovered in the light,' as Windischmann and Justi have
it.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[26:4](sbe0516.htm#fr_125) In comparing the
inundation produced by Tî*s*tar, with the Noachian deluge, it must be
recollected that the former is represented as occurring before mankind
had propagated on the earth.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[27:1](sbe0516.htm#fr_126) The term
farâkû-kar*d*, 'wide-formed,' is a free Pahlavi translation of Av.
vouru-kasha, 'wide-shored,' or 'having wide abysses,' applied to the
boundless ocean (see Chap. XIII, 1).

<span id="fn_127"></span>[27:2](sbe0516.htm#fr_127) For the Avesta
account of this expedition of Tî*s*tar, see Tî*s*tar Yt. 20-29.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[27:3](sbe0516.htm#fr_128) Miswritten Apav*s*
or Apava*s* in Pâzand, by all MSS. in this chapter, but see Chap.
XXVIII, 39.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[27:4](sbe0516.htm#fr_129) The word parasang is
here used for Av. hâthra, which was about an English mile (see Chap.
XXVI, 1).

<span id="fn_130"></span>[27:5](sbe0516.htm#fr_130) A quotation from
Tî*s*tar Yt. 25.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[28:1](sbe0516.htm#fr_131) Mentioned in Vend.
XIX, 135, thus: 'thou shouldst propitiate the fire Vâzi*s*ta, the smiter
of the demon Spen*g*aghra.' It, is also written Spên*g*argâk in Chap.
XVII, 1, and Aspen*g*arôgâ in Chap. XXVIII, 39.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[28:2](sbe0516.htm#fr_132) That is, the
lightning (see Chap. XVII, 1).

<span id="fn_133"></span>[28:3](sbe0516.htm#fr_133) Or, 'a tumult and
flashing.' Justi has 'howling and shrieking;' the two words being very
ambiguous in the original.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[28:4](sbe0516.htm#fr_134) See Chap. XIII, 6.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[28:5](sbe0516.htm#fr_135) See Chap. XXII, 1-3.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[29:1](sbe0516.htm#fr_136) Probably meaning the
north side of the Arêdvîvsûr fountain of the sea, which is said to be on
the lofty Hûgar, a portion of Albûr*z*, from the northern side of which
these two semi-mythical rivers are said to flow (see Chaps. XII, 5, XX,
1).

<span id="fn_137"></span>[29:2](sbe0516.htm#fr_137) See Chap. XX, 2.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[29:3](sbe0516.htm#fr_138) Here written Arêng,
but the usual Pahlavi reading is Arag; the nasal of the Av. Rangha being
generally omitted in Pahlavi, as other nasals are sometimes; thus we
often find sag for sang, 'stone.'
