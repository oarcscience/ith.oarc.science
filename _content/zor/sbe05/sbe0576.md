### CHAPTER XVI.

0\. In the name of God (yazdân) I write a paragraph (babâ) where the
sins which are as it were small are *mentioned* one *by* one.

1\. The least sin is a Farmân; *and* a Farmân is three coins of five
annas <span id="fr_1882"></span>[2](#fn_1870), some say three coins. 2.
An Âgerept is, as regards whatever weapon (snê*s*) men strike with in
the world, whenever the weapon is taken in hand; and taken up by *any*
one four finger-*breadths* from the ground *it is* the root <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[3](#fn_1871) of an

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Âgerept for him;.
and the retribution and punishment for an Âgerept should be fifty-three
dirhams (*g*û*g*an) <span id="fr_1884"></span>[1](#fn_1872). 3. When the
weapon turns downwards *it is* the root of an Avôîri*s*t for him, and
his sentence (dînâ) is to be changed; his retribution *and* punishment
should be seventy-three dirhams <span id="fr_1885"></span>[2](#fn_1873),
which is when anything further occurs. 4. When he shall lay the weapon
on *any* one *it is* the root of an Aredû*s* for *him*, and his
retribution *and* punishment are thirty stîrs; if the wound thereby made
by him be one-fifth of a span (dî*s*t) <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[3](#fn_1874) *it is* no root of an Aredû*s* *for*
him, and his retribution *and* punishment are the same thirty stîrs.

5\. I write the degrees of sin:—A Srôshô-*k*aranâm <span
id="fr_1887"></span>[4](#fn_1875) is three coins and a half, a Farmân is
a Srôshô-*k*aranâm, an Âgerept is sixteen stîrs, an Avôîri*s*t is
twenty-five stîrs, an Aredû*s* is thirty, a Khôr is sixty, a Bâ*z*âî is
ninety, a Yât is a hundred and eighty, *and* a Tanâpûhar is three
hundred <span id="fr_1888"></span>[5](#fn_1876).

6\. The good works which are in the *ceremonial*

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

worship of the sacred beings (ya*z*i*s*n-i yazdân):—*Consecrating* a
sacred cake (drôn) <span id="fr_1889"></span>[1](#fn_1877) is a good
work of one Tanâpûhar <span id="fr_1890"></span>[2](#fn_1878); a *form*
of worship (ya*s*t) <span id="fr_1891"></span>[3](#fn_1879) is a hundred
Tanâpûhars; a Vispara*d* <span id="fr_1892"></span>[4](#fn_1880) is a
thousand Tanâpûhars; a Dô-hômâst <span id="fr_1893"></span>[5](#fn_1881)
is ten thousand; a Dvâ*z*dah-hômâst is a hundred thousand, *and* the
merit (kirfak) of every one which is *performed* with holy-water is said
*to be* a hundred to one; a Hâ*d*ôkht <span
id="fr_1894"></span>[6](#fn_1882) is two thousand Tanâpûhars, *and* with
holy-water it becomes a hundred to one <span
id="fr_1895"></span>[7](#fn_1883).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1870"></span>[379:2](sbe0576.htm#fr_1882) Reading 3 nûmâî-i
5 ânak, but this is uncertain, and if correct must have been written in
India, as the anna is an Indian coin worth nearly three halfpence. The
coin of five annas was probably a dirham, as the dirham being about
fifty grains of silver (see note on *g*û*g*an in Chap. I, 2), and the
rûpî having formerly been less than 180 grains in Gu*g*arât, the former
would be nearly five-sixteenths of the latter, that is, five annas. It
may, therefore, be assumed that the amount of the Farmân is here taken
at three dirhams, as in Chap. XI, 2; but in § 5 it appears to be 3½
dirhams, and in Chap. I, 2 as much as sixteen dirhams.

<span id="fn_1871"></span>[379:3](sbe0576.htm#fr_1883) See Chap. II, 69,
note.

<span id="fn_1872"></span>[380:1](sbe0576.htm#fr_1884) § 5 says sixteen
stîrs, which, if equivalent to these fifty-three dirhams, would imply 3
5/16 dirhams to the stîr, instead of four as usually stated. (see Chap.
I, 2). The amounts mentioned in Chaps. I, 2, XI, 2 are very different.

<span id="fn_1873"></span>[380:2](sbe0576.htm#fr_1885) § 5 says
twenty-five stîrs, which, at 3 5/16 dirhams to the stîr (as in the case
of Âgerept), would be very nearly eighty-three dirhams, which is
probably the number we ought to read in the text, and also, possibly, in
Chap. XI, 2.

<span id="fn_1874"></span>[380:3](sbe0576.htm#fr_1886) The dî*s*t is a
span of ten finger-breadths (about 7½ inches) between the thumb and
middle finger (see Bund. XXVI, 3, note).

<span id="fn_1875"></span>[380:4](sbe0576.htm#fr_1887) See Chap. IV, 14,
note. Comparing the amount here mentioned with that of the Farmân in §
1, the Srôshô-*k*aranâm, which is here made equal to the Farmân, appears
to amount to 3½ dirhams, which agrees very nearly with the statement in
Chap. X, 24, but differs from that in Chap. XI, 2.

<span id="fn_1876"></span>[380:5](sbe0576.htm#fr_1888) For similar
scales of degrees, see Chaps. I, 2, XI, 2.

<span id="fn_1877"></span>[381:1](sbe0576.htm#fr_1889) See Chap. III,
32. The Persian Rivâyats explain that this is when the proper ritual is
merely recited, without using the sacred twigs and other ceremonial
apparatus; when the twigs are used the merit is ten times as great.

<span id="fn_1878"></span>[381:2](sbe0576.htm#fr_1890) That is,
sufficient to counterbalance a Tanâpûhar sin (see Chap. I, 1, 2).

<span id="fn_1879"></span>[381:3](sbe0576.htm#fr_1891) A Ya*s*t is a
formula of praise in honour of some particular angel; when recited with
all the accessories of sacred twigs and other ceremonial apparatus, the
merit is ten times as great as is mentioned in the text.

<span id="fn_1880"></span>[381:4](sbe0576.htm#fr_1892) The Vispara*d*
service includes the Yasna, and when performed with the use of the
sacred twigs, holy-water, and other ceremonial apparatus the merit is
ten times as great as here stated; some authorities say it is a hundred
times as great.

<span id="fn_1881"></span>[381:5](sbe0576.htm#fr_1893) This kind of
Hômâst is not mentioned in Dastûr Jâmâspji's explanation of this species
of religious service (see B. Yt. II, 59, note); it occurs, however, in
the Nîrangistân as a distinct kind, though called merely Hômâst in the
Persian Rivâyats.

<span id="fn_1882"></span>[381:6](sbe0576.htm#fr_1894) See B. Yt. III,
25.

<span id="fn_1883"></span>[381:7](sbe0576.htm#fr_1895) The merits of
other prayers and ceremonies are detailed in the Persian Rivâyats; thus,
that of the ordinary recital of a Vendidad (which includes both Yasna
and Vispara*d*) is sixty thousand Tanâpûhars, and when with sacred twigs
and holy-water it is a hundred thousand; that of the recital of any
Nyâyi*s* (see Chap. VII, 4), or of taking and retaining a prayer (vâ*g*,
see Chap. III, 6) inwardly, is one Tanâpûhar.
