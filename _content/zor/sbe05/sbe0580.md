### CHAPTER XX <span id="fr_1936"></span>[2](#fn_1924).

1\. *In* one place it is declared that it is said by revelation (dînô)
that a man is to go as much as possible (*k*and vê*s*-ast) to the abode
of fires <span id="fr_1937"></span>[3](#fn_1925), and the salutation
(nîyâyi*s*nŏ) of fire <span id="fr_1938"></span>[4](#fn_1926) is to be
performed *with* reverence; because three times every day the archangels
form an assembly in the abode of fires, and shed good works and
righteousness there; and then the good works and righteousness, which
are shed there, become more lodged in the body of *him* who goes much
thither, and performs many salutations of fire *with* reverence.

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

2\. This, too, that the nature of wisdom is just like fire; for, in this
world, *there* is nothing which shall become so complete as that thing
which is made with wisdom; and every fire, too, that they kindle and
*one* sees from far, makes manifest *what is* safe and uninjured
(aîrâkht); whatever is safe in fire is safe for ever, and whatever is
uninjured in fire is uninjured for ever.

3\. This, too, that a disposition in which is no wisdom is such-like as
a clear, unsullied (anâhûk) fountain which is choked (bastŏ) and never
goes into use; and the disposition with which *there* is wisdom is
such-like as a clear, unsullied fountain, over which an industrious man
stands *and* takes *it* into use; cultivation restrains *it*, and it
gives crops (bar) to the world.

4\. This, too, that these three things are to be done by men, to force
the *demon of* corruption (nasû*s*) <span
id="fr_1939"></span>[1](#fn_1927) far away from the body, to be
steadfast in the religion, and to perform good works. 5. To force the
*demon of* corruption far away from the body is this, that before the
sun *has* come up *one* is to wash the hands <span
id="fr_1940"></span>[2](#fn_1928) and face with bull's urine and water;
to be steadfast in the religion is this, that *one* is to reverence the
sun <span id="fr_1941"></span>[3](#fn_1929); and to perform good works
is this, that *one* is to destroy several noxious creatures.

6\. This, too, that the three greatest concerns of men are these, to
make him who is an enemy a friend, to make him who is wicked righteous,
and to make him who is ignorant learned. 7. To make

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

an enemy a friend is this, that out of the worldly wealth *one* has
before him he keeps a friend in mind; to make a wicked *one* righteous
is this, that from the sin, whereby he becomes wicked, *one* turns him
away; and to make an ignorant *one* learned is this, that *one* is to
manage himself so that he who is ignorant may learn of him.

8\. This, too, *that* the walks of men are to be directed chiefly to
these three places, to the abode of the well-informed, to the abode of
the good, *and* to the abode of fires <span
id="fr_1942"></span>[1](#fn_1930). 9. To the abode of the well-informed,
that so *one* may become wiser, and religion be more lodged in *one's*
person; to the abode of the good for this *reason*, that so, among good
and evil, he may thereby renounce the evil and carry home *the
good* <span id="fr_1943"></span>[2](#fn_1931); and to the abode of fires
for this *reason*, that so the spiritual fiend may turn away from him.

10\. This, too, that *he* whose actions are for the soul, the world is
then his own, and the spiritual *existence* more his own; and *he* whose
actions are for the body, the spiritual *existence* has *him* at
pleasure, *and* they snatch the world from him compulsorily.

11\. This, too, that Bakht-âfrî*d* <span
id="fr_1944"></span>[3](#fn_1932) said, that every Gâtha (gâsân) <span
id="fr_1945"></span>[4](#fn_1933) of Aûharmazd has been an opposition

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

of the one adversary, and the renunciation *of sin* (patîtîk) <span
id="fr_1946"></span>[1](#fn_1934) for the opposition of every fiend.

12\. This, too, that, regarding the world, anxiety is not to be
suffered, it is not to be considered as anything whatever, and is not to
be let slip from the hand. 13. Anxiety is not to be suffered for this
*reason*, because that which is ordained will happen; it is not to be
considered as anything whatever for this *reason*, because should it be
expedient it is necessary to abandon *it*; and it is not to be let slip
from the hand for this *reason*, because it is proper, in the world, to
provide a spiritual *existence* for oneself.

14\. This, too, that the best thing is truth, and the worst thing is
deceit; and *there* is *he* who speaks true *and* thereby becomes
wicked, and *there* is *he* who speaks false *and* thereby becomes
righteous.

15\. This, too, that fire is not to be extinguished <span
id="fr_1947"></span>[2](#fn_1935), for *this* is a sin; and *there* is
*he* who extinguishes *it, and* is good.

16\. This, too, is declared, that nothing is to be given to the vile;
and *there* is *he by* whom the best and most pleasant ragout
(khûr*d*îk) is to be given to the vile.

17\. On these, too, is the attention of men *to be fixed*, because
*there* is a remedy for everything but death, a hope for everything but
wickedness, everything will lapse <span
id="fr_1948"></span>[3](#fn_1936) except righteousness, it is possible

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

to manage everything but temper (gôhar), and it is possible *for*
everything to change but divine providence (bakô-bakhtô).

18\. This, too, is declared, that Frê*d*ûn <span
id="fr_1949"></span>[1](#fn_1937) wished to slay A*z*-i Dahâk <span
id="fr_1950"></span>[2](#fn_1938), *but* Aûharmazd spoke thus: 'Do not
slay *him* now, for the earth will become full of noxious creatures.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1924"></span>[393:2](sbe0580.htm#fr_1936) The contents of
this chapter conclude the MS. M6; a few lines even having been lost at
the end of that MS., though preserved in some of its older copies. A
more modern copy, in the MS. No. 121 of the Ouseley collection in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford, contains §§ 4-17, appended to the
Bundahi*s*. Complete Pâzand versions, derived from M6, occur in L7 and
L22, immediately following the Pâzand of Chap. XVIII.

<span id="fn_1925"></span>[393:3](sbe0580.htm#fr_1937) The fire-temple.

<span id="fn_1926"></span>[393:4](sbe0580.htm#fr_1938) That is, the
Âtâ*s* Nyâyi*s* is to be recited.

<span id="fn_1927"></span>[394:1](sbe0580.htm#fr_1939) See Chap. II, 1.

<span id="fn_1928"></span>[394:2](sbe0580.htm#fr_1940) See Chap. VII, 7.

<span id="fn_1929"></span>[394:3](sbe0580.htm#fr_1941) See Chap. VII,
1-6.

<span id="fn_1930"></span>[395:1](sbe0580.htm#fr_1942) The fire-temple.

<span id="fn_1931"></span>[395:2](sbe0580.htm#fr_1943) Assuming that the
word *s*apîrîh, 'the good,' has been omitted by mistake; the sentence
appearing to be unintelligible without it.

<span id="fn_1932"></span>[395:3](sbe0580.htm#fr_1944) See B. Yt. I, 7.

<span id="fn_1933"></span>[395:4](sbe0580.htm#fr_1945) The word gâsân
being plural, Gâtha must be taken in its collective sense as an
assemblage of hymns. The word can also be read dahî*s*n, 'creation,' but
this meaning seems improbable here.

<span id="fn_1934"></span>[396:1](sbe0580.htm#fr_1946) That is, the
Patit or formula of renunciation (see Chap. IV, 14).

<span id="fn_1935"></span>[396:2](sbe0580.htm#fr_1947) Literally,
'killed.'

<span id="fn_1936"></span>[396:3](sbe0580.htm#fr_1948) M6 ends at this
point, the next folio being lost. The remainder of the chapter has been
recovered from a copy in Bombay, checked by the Pâz. MSS. L7 and L22,
all of which must have <span id="page_397">p. 397</span> been derived
from M6 before it lost its last folio; whereas the MS. No. 121 of the
Ouseley collection at Oxford, which ends at the same point, must have
been written after the folio was lost.

<span id="fn_1937"></span>[397:1](sbe0580.htm#fr_1949) See Bund. XXXI,
7.

<span id="fn_1938"></span>[397:2](sbe0580.htm#fr_1950) See Bund. XXIX,
9, XXXI, 6, B. Yt. III, 55-61.
