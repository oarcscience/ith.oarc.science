<P><A NAME="fn_1841"></A><A HREF="sbe0574.htm#fr_1853">369:5</A> That is, it becomes desecrated through some fault in the ceremony, <A NAME="page_370"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 370</FONT></A> for any ceremony, which is too imperfect for acceptance by the celestial beings, is supposed to be appropriated by the demons, as performed for their benefit (see Chap. IX, 5). Demon worship is a term also applied to many other evil actions which are supposed to give the demons special power over the perpetrator of them.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1842"></A><A HREF="sbe0574.htm#fr_1854">370:1</A> See Chap. III, 32, note.</P>

When praying, a Parsi must face either the sun, or a fire or lamp; and when the direction of the sun is doubtful, or when it is nearly overhead, he must face to the south, even when he is in so low a latitude that the sun may be somewhat to the north of him.</P>

XI, 4-6, and is placed upon one of the cakes on the left side of the table during consecration, while the frasasts are the cakes on the right-hand side of the table (see Chap. III, 32, note).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1846"></A><A HREF="sbe0574.htm#fr_1858">371:1</A> See Chaps. III, 35, VII, 8.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1847"></A><A HREF="sbe0574.htm#fr_1859">371:2</A> See Bund. XXV, 9. The text appears to refer to the transition from the Ushahina to the H&acirc;vani G&acirc;h at daybreak; and as certain portions of the prayers are varied according to the period of the day, it is very necessary to know precisely when each period commences, so as to avoid vitiating the whole ceremonial by the use of a wrong prayer.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1850"></A><A HREF="sbe0574.htm#fr_1862">371:5</A> This chapter is followed (in both the old MSS. M6 and K20) by the Pahlavi text of the Pat&icirc;t-i Kh&ucirc;<I>d</I>, or renunciation of one's own <I>sin</I>, a translation of which will be found in Bleeck's English version of the Avesta, London, 1864, III, pp. 159-162, derived from Spiegel's German translation of the P&acirc;zand text. This translation is fairly correct on the whole, although some passages might be improved, thus (p. 16 2), instead of 'all sins which may attack the character of man [or] have attacked my character, if I, on account of much death, have not recognised the death,' &amp;c., we should read 'of all sins which may become the lot of men, and have become my lot, on account of whose excessive number I do not know the number,' &amp;c.</P>
