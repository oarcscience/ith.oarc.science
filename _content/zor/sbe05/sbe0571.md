### PART II.—*A Supplementary Treatise* <span id="fr_1647"></span>[1](#fn_1635)

## CHAPTER XI.

1\. The degrees of sin are these <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[2](#fn_1636), such *as* a Farmân, Srôshô-*k*aranâm,
Âgerept, Aîvîri*s*t, Aredû*s*, Khôr, Bâ*z*âî, Yât, and Tanâpûhar, and I
*will* mention each of them a second time. 2. A Farmân is the weight of
three dirhams of four mads <span id="fr_1649"></span>[3](#fn_1637); a

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Srôshô-*k*aranâm
is one dirham *and* two mads; three Srôshô-*k*aranâms are the weight of
four dirhams and two mads <span id="fr_1650"></span>[1](#fn_1638); an
Âgerept is thirty-three stîrs <span id="fr_1651"></span>[2](#fn_1639);
an Aîvîri*s*t is the weight of thirty-three dirhams; an Aredû*s* is
thirty *stîrs* <span id="fr_1652"></span>[3](#fn_1640); a Khôr is sixty
stîrs; a Bâ*z*âî is ninety stîrs; a Yât is a hundred and eighty stîrs,
and a Tanâpûhar is three hundred stîrs.

3\. Every one ought to be unhesitating *and* unanimous about this, that
righteousness is the one thing, and heaven (garô*d*mân) <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[4](#fn_1641) the one place, *which* is good, and
contentment the one thing more comfortable.

4\. When a sheep <span id="fr_1654"></span>[5](#fn_1642) is slaughtered
and divided, its meat-offering (gâvûs-dâk) <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[6](#fn_1643) is to be thus presented:—the tongue,
jaw, and left eye are the

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

angel Hôm's <span id="fr_1656"></span>[1](#fn_1644) own; the neck is
Ashavahi*s*t's <span id="fr_1657"></span>[2](#fn_1645) own; the head is
the angel Vâê's <span id="fr_1658"></span>[3](#fn_1646) own; the right
shoulder (arm) is Ardvîsûr's <span id="fr_1659"></span>[4](#fn_1647),
the left is Drvâsp's <span id="fr_1660"></span>[5](#fn_1648); the right
thigh (hakht) is *for the guardian spirit* <span
id="fr_1661"></span>[6](#fn_1649) *of* Vi*s*tâsp, and the left *for* the
guardian spirit of *G*âmâsp <span id="fr_1662"></span>[7](#fn_1650); the
back is *for* the supreme chief <span id="fr_1663"></span>[8](#fn_1651);
the loin is the spirits' own; the belly is Spendarma*d*'s <span
id="fr_1664"></span>[9](#fn_1652); the testicles <span
id="fr_1665"></span>[10](#fn_1653) are *for* the star Vanand <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[11](#fn_1654) the kidneys are

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Haptôîring's <span
id="fr_1667"></span>[1](#fn_1655); the ventricle (naska*d*akŏ) <span
id="fr_1668"></span>[2](#fn_1656) is *for* the guardian spirit of
priests; the lungs are *for* the guardian spirit of warriors; the liver
is *for* compassion and sustenance <span
id="fr_1669"></span>[3](#fn_1657) of the poor; the spleen is
Mânsarspend's <span id="fr_1670"></span>[4](#fn_1658); the fore-legs
(bâ*z*âî) are *for* the waters; the heart is *for* the fires; the
entrail fat is Ar*d*âî-fravar*d*'s <span
id="fr_1671"></span>[5](#fn_1659); the tail-bone (dunb-ga*z*akŏ) is
*for* the guardian spirit of Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân <span
id="fr_1672"></span>[6](#fn_1660); the tail (dunbak) is *for* Vâd <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[7](#fn_1661) the righteous; the right eye is in the
share of the moon <span id="fr_1674"></span>[8](#fn_1662); and any <span
id="fr_1675"></span>[9](#fn_1663) *that* may be left over from those is
*for* the other archangels. 5. *There* have been *those* who may have
spoken about protection, and *there have* been *those* who *may have
done so* about meat-offerings; whoever *has* spoken about protection is
such as *has*

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

spoken well, and whoever *has* spoken about meat-offerings has not
spoken everything which is noteworthy <span
id="fr_1676"></span>[1](#fn_1664). 6. When *one* shall offer up <span
id="fr_1677"></span>[2](#fn_1665) *what* pertains to one (khadûkag) on
account of another it is proper; except the tongue, jaw, and left eye,
for *that* those are the angel Hôm's own is manifest from the passage:
'Hizvãm fr*e*renao*d* <span id="fr_1678"></span>[3](#fn_1666),' *&c.*

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1635"></span>[334:1](sbe0571.htm#fr_1647) This second part
is evidently by another writer, for he not only repeats several passages
(Chaps. XI, 1, 2, XII, 11, 13-16, 18, 20), which are given in the first
part, but he also writes generally in a less simple style. In some MSS.
of Sls. alone, such as M9, the second part immediately follows the
first, as in this translation; indicating that it has been accepted as a
part of the same work. But in M6 the two parts are separated by the
Farh. Okh., occupying twenty folios; and in K20 there is an interval of
ninety-two folios, containing the Farh. Okh., Bund., B. Yt., and several
other texts.

<span id="fn_1636"></span>[334:2](sbe0571.htm#fr_1648) §§ 1, 2 are a
repetition of Chap. I, 1, 2, with a few variations. The number of
degrees is here raised to nine by the addition of the Srôshô-*k*aranâm
(see Chap. X, 24), which is written Srôsha*k*aranâm in both these
sections.

<span id="fn_1637"></span>[334:3](sbe0571.htm#fr_1649) Reading i mad-4,
instead of va m-4; the mad being a quarter-dirham (see Chap. X, 24,
note); or we can read 'weight and quantity (mâyah) of three dirhams.'
The amount of the Farmân <span id="page_335">p. 335</span> here given
appears to agree with that stated in Chap. XVI, 1, but differs very much
from the sixteen dirhams mentioned in Chap. I, 2, and the twenty-eight
dirhams quoted by Spiegel.

<span id="fn_1638"></span>[335:1](sbe0571.htm#fr_1650) That is, one
Srôshô-*k*aranâm is one dirham and a half, and three of them, therefore,
are four dirhams and a half; the mad being a quarter-dirham. This
computation differs considerably from the amounts stated in Chaps. X,
24, XVI, 5, but corresponds better with the supposition (see Chap. IV,
14, note) that a Srôshô-*k*aranâm is one-third of a Farmân.

<span id="fn_1639"></span>[335:2](sbe0571.htm#fr_1651) Both this amount
and the next are evidently wrong, and no doubt the Pahlavi ciphers have
been corrupted. Chap. XVI, 5 gives 'sixteen' and 'twenty-five' stîrs,
which are probably correct, though the computation in Chap. I, 2 is very
different.

<span id="fn_1640"></span>[335:3](sbe0571.htm#fr_1652) Written Aredû*s*
30 sî, 'an Aredû*s* is 30 (thirty),' as in Chap. I, 2; with which also
all the remaining amounts correspond.

<span id="fn_1641"></span>[335:4](sbe0571.htm#fr_1653) See note on
pâhlûm ahvân in Chap. VI, 3.

<span id="fn_1642"></span>[335:5](sbe0571.htm#fr_1654) Or 'goat.'

<span id="fn_1643"></span>[335:6](sbe0571.htm#fr_1655) Av. gâu*s*
hudh*a*u, which is generally represented by a small piece of butter
placed upon one of the sacred cakes; but on certain occasions small
pieces of meat are used. The object of this section is to point out what
part of the animal is suitable for use in a ceremony dedicated to any
one of the angels, or spirits, mentioned.

<span id="fn_1644"></span>[336:1](sbe0571.htm#fr_1656) Av. haoma, the
angel of the Hôm plant (see Yas. IX-XI, Bund. XVIII, 1-3, XXVII, 4, 24),
the juice of which is used in ceremonial worship by the Parsis.

<span id="fn_1645"></span>[336:2](sbe0571.htm#fr_1657) The same as
Ar*d*avahi*s*t (see Bund. I, 216).

<span id="fn_1646"></span>[336:3](sbe0571.htm#fr_1658) M6 has 'Râm' as a
gloss; he is the Vayô of the Râm Yt., 'the good Vaê' of Mkh. II, 115,
who assists the righteous souls in their progress to the other world;
his name, Râm, is given to the twenty-first day of the Parsi month (see
Chap. XXII, 21).

<span id="fn_1647"></span>[336:4](sbe0571.htm#fr_1659) Av. Ardvî sûra of
the Âbân Yt., a title of Anâhita, the female angel of the waters (see
Bund. XXXII, 8). This title is written Arêdvîvsûr in the Bundahi*s*, and
applied to the source of pure water (Bund. XIII); while the name Âvân,
'waters,' is given to the eighth month and the tenth day of each month
in the Parsi year.

<span id="fn_1648"></span>[336:5](sbe0571.htm#fr_1660) Av. Drvâspa of
the Gô*s* Yt., the name of the female angel of cattle, called Gô*s*ûrvan
in Bund. IV; her alternative name, Gô*s*, is given to the fourteenth day
of the Parsi month.

<span id="fn_1649"></span>[336:6](sbe0571.htm#fr_1661) The word
fravash-i, 'the guardian spirit of,' is evidently omitted here, as it
occurs with the next name. For Vi*s*tâsp, see Bund. XXXI, 29, XXXIV, 7.

<span id="fn_1650"></span>[336:7](sbe0571.htm#fr_1662) Av. *G*âmâspa of
Yas. XIII, 24, XLV, 17, XLVIII, 9, L, 18, Âbân Yt. 68, &c., the prime
minister of Vi*s*tâsp.

<span id="fn_1651"></span>[336:8](sbe0571.htm#fr_1663) Ratpôk berêza*d*
stands for the Av. rathwô berezatô of Yas. I, 46, &c., a 'supreme chief'
who is often associated with the chiefs of the various subdivisions of
time, and seems to be Aûharmazd himself (see Yas. LVI, i, 10).

<span id="fn_1652"></span>[336:9](sbe0571.htm#fr_1664) The female
archangel who has charge of the earth (see Chap. XV, 5, 20-24, and Bund.
I, 26).

<span id="fn_1653"></span>[336:10](sbe0571.htm#fr_1665) The word gûnd
has here, in most MSS., the usual Persian gloss dahân, 'mouth' (see
Bund. XIX, 1), which is a very improbable meaning in this place.

<span id="fn_1654"></span>[336:11](sbe0571.htm#fr_1666) Probably
Fomalhaut (see Bund. II, 7, note).

<span id="fn_1655"></span>[337:1](sbe0571.htm#fr_1667) Ursa Major,
called Haptôk-ring in Bund. II, 7.

<span id="fn_1656"></span>[337:2](sbe0571.htm#fr_1668) Translating in
accordance with the Persian gloss *k*ustah, given in the modern MS. M9;
but nas-ka*d*akŏ may perhaps mean 'the womb.'

<span id="fn_1657"></span>[337:3](sbe0571.htm#fr_1669) Reading
sar-âyi*s*nŏ, 'maturity,' the usual equivalent of Av. thrao*s*ta (see
Yas. XXXIV, 3), and not srâyi*s*nŏ, 'chanting.'

<span id="fn_1658"></span>[337:4](sbe0571.htm#fr_1670) Av. mãthra
spe*n*ta, 'the beneficent sayings, or holy word,' of which this angel is
a personification; his name is often corrupted into Mahraspend or
Mâraspend, and is given to the twenty-ninth day of the Parsi month (see
Chap. XXII, 29).

<span id="fn_1659"></span>[337:5](sbe0571.htm#fr_1671) A personification
of the Av. ashaonãm fravashayô, 'guardian angels of the righteous' (see
Fravardîn Yt. I, &c.), whence the first month, and the nineteenth day of
each month, in the Parsi year, are called Fravar*d*în.

<span id="fn_1660"></span>[337:6](sbe0571.htm#fr_1672) This clause and
the next are omitted in K20.

<span id="fn_1661"></span>[337:7](sbe0571.htm#fr_1673) The angel of the
wind, whose name is given to the twenty-second day of the Parsi month
(see Chap. XXII, 22).

<span id="fn_1662"></span>[337:8](sbe0571.htm#fr_1674) Or its angel,
Mâh, whose name is given to the twelfth day of the Parsi month.

<span id="fn_1663"></span>[337:9](sbe0571.htm#fr_1675) M6 has va
aê-maman = va aê*k* (Pers. î*k*, 'any'); K20 has kolâ maman, 'whatever,'
and omits the words 'may be left over' and 'other.'

<span id="fn_1664"></span>[338:1](sbe0571.htm#fr_1676) Meaning,
apparently, that to pray for protection as a favour is better than to
pray for it as a return for an offering.

<span id="fn_1665"></span>[338:2](sbe0571.htm#fr_1677) K20 has 'shall
give up.'

<span id="fn_1666"></span>[338:3](sbe0571.htm#fr_1678) It is doubtful if
this passage can be found in the extant Avesta; but a passage of similar
meaning, and containing the words fr*e*renao*d* and hizvô, occurs in
Yas. XI, 16, which states that 'the righteous father, Ahuramazda,
produced for me, Haoma, as a Draona, the two jaws, with the tongue and
the left eye;' and it then proceeds (Yas. XI, 17-19) to curse any one
'who shall deprive me of that Draona, or shalt himself enjoy, or shall
give away what the righteous Ahuramazda gave me, the two jaws, with the
tongue and the left eye.'
