<p>1. And as he (Aharman) came secondly to the water, together with him rushed in, <I>on</I> the horse Cancer, he who is the most watery T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar; the equally watery <I>one</I>, that is called Avrak&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_956"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, gave forth a cloud <I>and</I> went down in the day; that is</p>

<p><A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A></p>  
<p>declared as the movement of the first-comers of the creatures. 2. Cancer became a zodiacal constellation (akhtar); it is the fourth constellation <I>of the zodiac</I> for this reason, because the month T&icirc;r is the fourth month of the year&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_957"></A><A HREF="#fn_951"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>3. And as T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar begged for assistance, Voh&ucirc;man and H&ocirc;m are therefore co-operating with him in command, B&ucirc;r<I>g</I> of the waters and the water in mutual aid, and the righteous guardian spirits in keeping the peace. 4. He was converted into three forms, which are the form of a man, the form of a bull, <I>and</I> the form of a horse; and each form was distinguished in brilliance for ten nights, and lets its rain fall on the night for the destruction of noxious creatures. 5. The drops became each separately <I>like</I> a great bowl in which water is drawn; and as to that on <I>which</I> they are driven, they kill all the noxious creatures except the reptiles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_958"></A><A HREF="#fn_952"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, who entered into the muddiness of the earth.</p>  
<p>6. Afterwards, the wind spirit, in the form of a man, became manifest on the earth; radiant <I>and</I> tall he had a kind of wooden boot (m&ucirc;kv&#335;-a&ecirc;-i d&acirc;r&icirc;n&ocirc;) on <I>his</I> feet; <I>and</I> as when the life shall stir the body, the body is advancing with like vigour, <I>so</I> that spirit of the wind stirs forth the inner nature of the atmospheric wind, the wind pertaining to the whole earth is forth, and the water in its grasp is flung out from it to the sides of the earth, and its wide-formed ocean arose therefrom.</p>  
<p>7. It (the ocean) keeps one-third of this earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_959"></A><A HREF="#fn_953"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,</p>

<p>and among its contents are a thousand sources <I>and</I> fountains, such as are called lakes (var); a thousand water-fountains, whose water is from the ocean, come up from the lakes <I>and</I> are poured forth into it. 8. And the size of some of all the lakes and all the fountains of water is as much as a fast rider on an Arab horse, <I>who</I> continually compasses <I>and</I> canters around <I>them</I>, will attain in forty days, which is 1900&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_960"></A><A HREF="#fn_954"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, long leagues (parasang-i akar&icirc;k), each league <I>being</I> at least 20,000 feet.</p>  
<p>9. And after the noxious creatures died&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_961"></A><A HREF="#fn_955"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and the poison therefrom was mixed up in the earth, in order to utterly destroy that poison T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar went down into the ocean; and Ap&acirc;&ocirc;sh, the demon, hastened to meet him, and <I>at</I> the alarm of the first contest T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar was in terror (par<I>d</I>). 10. And he applied unto A&ucirc;harmazd, <I>who</I> brought such power unto T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar <I>as</I> arises through propitiation and praise and invoking by name&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_962"></A><A HREF="#fn_956"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and they call forth such power unto T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar as <I>that of</I> ten vigorous horses, ten vigorous camels, ten vigorous bulls, ten mountains when hurled, and ten single-stream rivers when together. 11. And without alarm he drove out Ap&acirc;&ocirc;sh, the demon, and kept him away from the sources of the ocean.</p>  
<p>12. And with a cup and measuring bowl, which possessed the diligence even of a guardian spirit (frav&acirc;har), he seized many more handfuls of water,</p>

<p><A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and made <I>it</I> rain down&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_963"></A><A HREF="#fn_957"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> much more prodigiously, for destruction, drops as large as men's heads and bulls' heads, great and small. 13. And in that cloud and rain were the chastisement <I>and</I> beating which T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar and the fire V&acirc;zi<I>s</I>t <I>inflicted</I> on the opposition of Ap&acirc;&ocirc;sh; the all-deciding (visp&ocirc;-vi<I>k</I>&icirc;r) fire V&acirc;zi<I>s</I>t struck down with a club of fire, all-deciding among the malevolent (k&ecirc;bar&acirc;n&#335;).</p>  
<p>14. Ten days <I>and</I> nights there was rain, and its darting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_964"></A><A HREF="#fn_958"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>was</I> the shooting of the noxious creatures; afterwards, the wind drove <I>it</I> to the shore of the wide-formed ocean, and it is portioned out into three, and three seas arose from it; they are called the P&ucirc;&icirc;t&icirc;k, the Kam&icirc;r&icirc;<I>d</I>, and the Geh&acirc;n-b&ucirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_965"></A><A HREF="#fn_959"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 15. Of these the P&ucirc;&icirc;t&icirc;k itself is salt water, in which is a flow <I>and</I> ebb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_966"></A><A HREF="#fn_960"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; and the control of its flow and ebb is connected with the moon, and by its continual rotation, in coming up <I>and</I> going down, that of the moon is manifested. 16. The wide-formed <I>ocean</I> stands forth on the south side as to (pavan) Alb&ucirc;r<I>z</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_967"></A><A HREF="#fn_961"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and the P&ucirc;&icirc;t&icirc;k stands contiguous to it, and amidst it is the gulf (var) of Satav&ecirc;s, whose connection is with Satav&ecirc;s, which is the southern quarter. 17. In the activity of the sea, and in the increase and decrease of the moon, whose circuit is the whole of Iran, are the flow <I>and</I> ebb; of the</p>

<p>curving tails in front of the moon two issue forth, <I>and</I> have an abode in Satav&ecirc;s; one is the up-drag <I>and</I> one the down-drag; through the up-drag occurs the flood, <I>and</I> through the down-drag occurs the ebb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_968"></A><A HREF="#fn_962"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 18. And Satav&ecirc;s itself is a gulf (var) and side <I>arm</I> of the wide-formed ocean, for it drives back the impurity <I>and</I> turbidness which <I>come</I> from the salt sea, when they are continually going into the wide-formed ocean, with a mighty high wind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_969"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, while that which is clear through purity goes into the <A HREF="errata.htm#0">Ar&ecirc;dv&icirc;vs&ucirc;r</A> sources of the wide-formed ocean. 19. Besides these four&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_970"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> there are the small seas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_971"></A><A HREF="#fn_965"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>20. And, afterwards, <I>there</I> were made to flow from Alb&ucirc;r<I>z</I>, out of its northern border, two rivers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_972"></A><A HREF="#fn_966"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, which <I>were</I> the Arvand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_973"></A><A HREF="#fn_967"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>&#151;that is, the Digl&icirc;t, <I>and</I> the flow</p>

<p>of that river <I>was</I> to those of the setting <I>sun</I> (val fr&ocirc;<I>d</I>-yehevun<I>d</I>&acirc;n&#335;)&#151;<I>and</I> the V&ecirc;h&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_968"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> was the river of the first-comers to the sun; formed as two horns they went on to the ocean. 21. After them eighteen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_969"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> great rivers came out from the same Alb&ucirc;r<I>z</I>; <I>and</I> these twenty rivers, whose source is in Alb&ucirc;r<I>z</I>, go down into the earth, and arrive in Khvan&icirc;ras.</p>  
<p>22. Afterwards, two fountains of the sea are opened out for the earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, which are called the <I>K</I>&ecirc;<I>k</I>ast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_977"></A><A HREF="#fn_971"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>&#151;a lake which has no cold wind, <I>and</I> on whose shore rests the triumphant fire G&ucirc;<I>s</I>nasp&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_978"></A><A HREF="#fn_972"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and, secondly, the S&ocirc;var&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_979"></A><A HREF="#fn_973"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> which casts on <I>its</I> shores all turbidness, and keeps its own salt lake clear <I>and</I> pure, for it is like the semblance of an eye which casts out to <I>its</I> edges every ache and every impurity; and on account of its depth it is not reached to the bottom, for it goes into the ocean; and in its vicinity rests the beneficial fire B&ucirc;r<I>z</I>&icirc;n-Mitr&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_980"></A><A HREF="#fn_974"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_967"></A><A HREF="sbe0550.htm#fr_973">172:6</A> This appears to be a later identification of the Arag, Arang, or Ar&ecirc;ng river of Bund. XX with the Tigris, under its name Arvand, which is also found in the Bahman Ya<I>s</I>t (III, 21, 38) and the &Acirc;fr&icirc;n of the Seven Ameshaspends (&sect; 9). The Bundahi<I>s</I> (XX, 8) seems to connect the Arag (Araxes?) with the Oxus and Nile, and describes the Diglat or Tigris as a distinct river (Bund. XX, 12). This difference is one of the indications of the Bundahi<I>s</I> having been so old a book in the time of Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam that he sometimes misunderstood its meaning, which could hardly have been the case if it had been written by one of his contemporaries. As the Persian empire has several times included part of Egypt, the Nile must have then been well known to the Persians as the great western river of their world. The last time they had possession of part of Egypt was, for about half a century, in the reigns of Khusr&ocirc; <A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A> N&ocirc;shirv&acirc;n, A&ucirc;harmazd IV, and Khusr&ocirc; Parv&icirc;z; but since the early part of the seventh century the Tigris has practically been their extreme western limit; hence the change of the old Arag or Arang into the very similarly written Arvand, a name of the Tigris.</P>
