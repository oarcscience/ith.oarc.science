<p>On the coming in of Aharman to the creatures it is thus declared in revelation, that <I>in</I> the month Fravar<I>d</I>&icirc;n <I>and</I> the day A&ucirc;harmazd, at noon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_925"></A><A HREF="#fn_919"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he came forth to the frontier of the sky. 2. The sky sees <I>him</I> and, on account of <I>his</I> nature, fears as much as a sheep trembles at a wolf; <I>and</I> Aharman came on, scorching <I>and</I> burning into it. 3. Then he came to the water which was arranged below the earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_926"></A><A HREF="#fn_920"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and darkness without an eyelid was brought on by him; and he came on, through the middle of the earth, as a snake all-leaping comes on out of a hole; and he stayed within the whole earth. 4. The passage where he came on is his own, the way to hell, through which the demons make the wicked run.</p>  
<p>5. Afterwards, he came to a tree, such as was of a single root, the height of which <I>was</I> several feet, and <I>it was</I> without branches and without bark, juicy <I>and</I> sweet; and to keep the strength of. all kinds of trees in its race, it was in the vicinity of the-middle of the earth; and at the self-same time <I>it became</I> quite withered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_927"></A><A HREF="#fn_921"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>6. Afterwards, he came to the ox, the sole-created&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_922"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, as it stood as high as G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I> on the</p>

As the adversary came upon <I>it</I> A&ucirc;harmazd gave <I>it</I> a narcotic, which is also called 'bang,' to eat, and to rub the 'bang' before the eye&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_924"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, so that the annoyance from the assault of crimes may be less; it became lean and ill, <I>and</I> fell upon its right breast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_925"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> trembling.</p>  
<p>8. Before the advance to G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>, who was then about one-third the height of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, <I>and</I> was brilliant as the sun; A&ucirc;harmazd forms, from the sweat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="#fn_926"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> on the man, a figure of fifteen years, radiant <I>and</I> tall, and sends it on to G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>; and, he also brings his sweat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="#fn_927"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> on to him as long as one Yath&acirc;-ah&ucirc;-vairy&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_934"></A><A HREF="#fn_928"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> is <I>being</I> recited. 9. When he issued from the sweat, and raised his eyes, he saw. the world when it was dark as night&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_935"></A><A HREF="#fn_929"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>; on the whole earth were the snake, the scorpion, the lizard (vazak), and noxious creatures of many kinds; <I>and</I> so the other kinds of quadrupeds stood among the</p>

<p>reptiles; every approach of the whole earth was as though not as much as a needle's point remained, in which there was no rush of noxious creatures. 10. <I>There were</I> the coming of a planetary <I>star</I> into planetary conjunction, and the moon and planets at sixes and sevens&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_936"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; many dark forms with the face and curls of A<I>z</I>-i Dah&acirc;k suffered punishment in company with certain non-Iranians; <I>and</I> he was amazed at calling the wicked out from the righteous.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_922"></A><A HREF="sbe0546.htm#fr_928">161:4</A> The primeval ox, or first-created representative of animals, as G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I> was of mankind; from which two representatives all mankind and animals are said to have been afterwards developed. There seems to have been some doubt as to the sex of this mythological ox; here it is distinctly stated to have been a female, but from Bund. X, 1, 2, XIV, 3, it would appear to have been a male, and this seems to be admitted by D&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam himself, in Chap. IX, 7.</P>

III, 19; but it may be a variant of anum&acirc;e, 'embryo,' in which case the translation should be, 'forms an embryo into the shape of a man of fifteen years.'</P>
