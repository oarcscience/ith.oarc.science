<p>1. On the rush of the destroyer at the creatures it is said, in revelation, that the evil spirit, when he saw the impotence of himself and the confederate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (h&acirc;m-dast) demons, owing to the righteous man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, became confounded, <I>and</I> seemed in confusion three thousand years. 2. During that confusion the archfiends&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of the demons severally shouted thus: 'Rise up, <I>thou</I> father of us! for we <I>will</I> cause a conflict in the world, the distress and injury from which <I>will</I> become those of A&ucirc;harmazd and the archangels.'</p>  
<p>3. Severally they twice recounted their own evil deeds, and it pleased him not; and that wicked evil spirit, through fear of the righteous man, was not able to lift up <I>his</I> head until the wicked <I>G</I>&ecirc;h&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> came, at the completion of the three thousand years. 4. And she shouted to the evil spirit thus: 'Rise up, <I>thou</I> father of us! for I <I>will</I> cause that conflict in the world wherefrom the distress and injury of A&ucirc;harmazd and the archangels <I>will</I> arise.' 5. And she twice recounted severally her own evil deeds, and it pleased him not; and that wicked evil spirit</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>rose not from that confusion, through fear of the righteous man.</p>  
<p>6. And, again, the wicked <I>G</I>&ecirc;h shouted thus: 'Rise up, <I>thou</I> father of us! for in that conflict I <I>will</I> shed thus much vexation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> on the righteous man and the labouring ox that, through my deeds, life <I>will</I> not be wanted, and I will destroy their living souls (nism&ocirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; I <I>will</I> vex the water, I <I>will</I> vex the plants, I <I>will</I> vex the fire of A&ucirc;harmazd, I <I>will</I> make the whole creation of A&ucirc;harmazd vexed.' 7. And she so recounted those evil deeds a second time, that the evil spirit was delighted and started up from that confusion; and he kissed <I>G</I>&ecirc;h upon the head, and the pollution which they call menstruation became apparent in <I>G</I>&ecirc;h.</p>  
<p>8. He shouted to <I>G</I>&ecirc;h thus: 'What is thy wish? so that I may give <I>it</I> thee.' And <I>G</I>&ecirc;h shouted to the evil spirit thus: 'A man is the wish, so give <I>it</I> to me.'</p>  
<p>9. The form of the evil spirit was a log-like lizard's (vazak) body, and he appeared a young man of fifteen years to <I>G</I>&ecirc;h, and that brought the thoughts of <I>G</I>&ecirc;h to him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>10. Afterwards, the evil spirit, with the confederate demons, went towards the luminaries, and he saw the sky; and he led them up, fraught with malicious intentions. 11. He stood upon one-third&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the inside of the sky, and he sprang, like a snake, out of the sky down to the earth.</p>  
<p>12. <I>In</I> the month Fravar<I>d</I>&icirc;n and the day A&ucirc;harmazd&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he rushed in at noon, and thereby the sky was as shattered and frightened by him, as a sheep by a wolf. 13. He came on to the water which was arranged&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> below the earth, and then the middle of this earth was pierced <I>and</I> entered by him. 14. Afterwards, he came to the vegetation, then to the ox, then to G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>, and then he came to fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; so, just like a fly, he rushed out upon the whole creation; and he made the world quite as injured and dark&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> at midday as though it were in dark night. 15. And noxious creatures. were diffused by him over the earth, biting and venomous, such as the snake, scorpion, frog (kalv&acirc;k), and lizard (vazak),&#151;so that not so much as the point of a needle remained <I>free</I> from noxious creatures. 16. And blight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> was diffused by him over the</p>

<p>vegetation, and it withered away immediately. 17. And avarice, want, pain, hunger, disease, lust, and lethargy were diffused by him abroad upon the ox and G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>.</p>  
<p>18. Before <I>his</I> coming to the ox, A&ucirc;harmazd ground up the healing fruit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which some call 'b&icirc;n&acirc;k,' small in water openly before <I>its</I> eyes, so that <I>its</I> damage <I>and</I> discomfort from the calamity (zani<I>s</I>n) might be less; and when it became at the same time lean and ill, as <I>its</I> breath went forth and it passed away, the ox also spoke thus: 'The cattle are to be created, <I>and</I> their work, labour, and care are to be appointed.'</p>  
<p>19. And before <I>his</I> coming to G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>, A&ucirc;harmazd brought forth a sweat upon G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>, so long as he might recite a prayer (v&acirc;<I>g</I>) of one stanza (vi<I>k</I>ast); moreover, A&ucirc;harmazd formed that sweat into the youthful body of a man of fifteen years, radiant <I>and</I> tall. 20. When G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I> issued from the sweat he saw the world dark as night, and the earth as though not a needle's point remained <I>free from</I> noxious creatures; the <I>celestial</I> sphere was in revolution, <I>and</I> the sun and moon remained in motion: <I>and</I> the world's struggle, owing to the clamour of the M&acirc;z&icirc;n&acirc;k&acirc;n demons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, was with the constellations.</p>  
<p>21. And the evil spirit thought that the creatures of A&ucirc;harmazd were all rendered useless except</p>

But his appointed time had not come, <I>and</I> he (Ast&ocirc;-v&icirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I>) obtained no means of noosing (&acirc;vi<I>z</I>&icirc;<I>d</I>an&#335;) <I>him</I>; as it is said that, when the opposition of the evil spirit came, the period of the life and rule of G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I> was appointed for thirty years. 23. After the coming of the adversary he lived thirty years, and G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I> spoke thus: 'Although the destroyer <I>has</I> come, mankind <I>will</I> be all of my race; and this one thing is good, when they perform duty and good works.'</p>  
<p>24. And, afterwards, he (the evil spirit) came to fire, and he mingled smoke and darkness with it. 25. The planets, with many demons, dashed against the <I>celestial</I> sphere, and they mixed the constellations; and the whole creation was as disfigured as though fire disfigured every place and smoke arose over <I>it</I>. 26. And ninety days <I>and</I> nights the heavenly angels were contending in the world with the confederate demons of the evil spirit, <I>and</I> hurled <I>them</I> confounded to hell; and the rampart of the sky was formed so that the adversary should not be able to mingle with it.</p>  
<p>27. Hell is in the middle of the earth; there where the evil spirit pierced the earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and rushed in upon it, as all the possessions of the world were</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>changing into duality, <I>and</I> persecution, contention, and mingling of high and low became manifest.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_84"></A><A HREF="sbe0512.htm#fr_84">15:3</A> The word kam&acirc;rak&acirc;n is literally 'those with an evil pate,' and is derived from Av. kameredha, 'the head of an evil being,' also applied to 'the evil summit' of Mount Arez&ucirc;ra (Vend. XIX, 140, 142), which is supposed to be at the gate of hell (see Chap. XII, 8). That the chief demons or arch-fiends are meant, appears, more clearly in Chap. XXVIII, 12, 44, where the word is kam&acirc;r&icirc;k&acirc;n.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_85"></A><A HREF="sbe0512.htm#fr_85">15:4</A> The personification of the impurity of menstruation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_86"></A><A HREF="sbe0512.htm#fr_86">16:1</A> The word v&ecirc;sh or v&icirc;sh may stand either for b&ecirc;sh, 'distress, vexation,' as here assumed, or for vish, 'poison,' as translated by Windischmann and Justi in accordance with the Paz. MSS.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_87"></A><A HREF="sbe0512.htm#fr_87">16:2</A> That this is the Huzv&acirc;ri<I>s</I> of r&ucirc;b&acirc;n, 'soul,' appears from Chap. XV, 3-5, where both words are used indifferently; but it is not given in the Huz.-P&acirc;z. Glossary. It is evidently equivalent to Chald. ni<I>s</I>m&acirc;, and ought probably to have the traditional pronunciation nisman, an abbreviation of nismman.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_88"></A><A HREF="sbe0512.htm#fr_88">16:3</A> This seems to be the literal meaning of the sentence, and is confirmed by Chap. XXVIII, 1, but Windischmann and Justi understand that the evil spirit formed a youth for <I>G</I>&ecirc;h out of a toad's body. The incident in the text may be compared with Milton's idea of Satan and Sin in Paradise Lost, Book II, 745-765.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_89"></A><A HREF="sbe0512.htm#fr_89">17:1</A> Perhaps referring to the proportion of the sky which is overspread by the darkness of night. The whole sentence is rather obscure.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_94"></A><A HREF="sbe0512.htm#fr_94">17:6</A> The word makh&acirc;, 'blow, stroke,' is a Huzv&acirc;ri<I>s</I> logogram not found in the glossaries; M6 has d&acirc;r, 'wood,' but this may be a misreading, due to the original, from which M6 was copied, being difficult to read.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_95"></A><A HREF="sbe0512.htm#fr_95">18:1</A> The word m&icirc;vang is an unusual form of m&icirc;vak, 'fruit.' It is probably to be traced to an Av. mivangh, which might mean 'fatness,' as Windischmann suggests.</P>
