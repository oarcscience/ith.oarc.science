### CHAPTER XXI <span id="fr_1951"></span>[3](#fn_1939).

1\. I write the indication of the midday shadow; may it be fortunate!

2\. Should the sun come <span id="fr_1952"></span>[4](#fn_1940) into
Cancer *the shadow* is one foot of the man, *at* the fifteenth *degree*
of Cancer *it* is one foot; *when* the sun is at Leo *it* is

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

one foot and a half, *at* the fifteenth of Leo *it* is two feet; *when*
the sun is *at* Virgo *it* is two feet and a half, *at* the fifteenth of
Virgo *it* is three feet and a half; *at* Libra *it* is four <span
id="fr_1953"></span>[1](#fn_1941) feet and a half, *at* the fifteenth of
Libra *it* is five feet and a half <span
id="fr_1954"></span>[2](#fn_1942); *at* Scorpio *it* is six feet and a
half, *at* the fifteenth of Scorpio *it* is seven <span
id="fr_1955"></span>[3](#fn_1943) feet and a half; *at* Sagittarius *it*
is eight feet and a half, *at* the fifteenth of Sagittarius *it* is nine
feet and a half; *at* Capricornus *it* is ten feet, *at* the fifteenth
of Capricornus *it* is nine <span id="fr_1956"></span>[4](#fn_1944) feet
and a half; *at* Aquarius *it* is eight <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[5](#fn_1945) feet and a half, *at* the fifteenth of
Aquarius *it* is seven feet and a half; *at* Pisces *it* is six feet and
a half, *at* the fifteenth of Pisces *it* is five feet and a half; *at*
Aries *it* is four feet and a half, *at* the fifteenth of Aries *it* is
three feet and a half; *at* Taurus *it* is two feet and a half, *at* the
fifteenth of Taurus *it* is two feet; *at* Gemini *it* is one foot and a
half, *at* the fifteenth of Gemini *it* is one foot <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[6](#fn_1946).

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

3\. The midday shadow is written <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[1](#fn_1947), may *its* end be good!

4\. I write the indication of the Aûzêrîn (afternoon) <span
id="fr_1960"></span>[2](#fn_1948) *period of the day*; may it be well
*and* fortunate by the help of God (yazdân)!

5\. When the day is at a maximum (pavan afzûnŏ), *and* the sun comes
unto the head <span id="fr_1961"></span>[3](#fn_1949) of Cancer, *and
one's* shadow becomes six feet and two parts <span
id="fr_1962"></span>[4](#fn_1950), he makes it the Aûzêrîn period (gâs).

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 6. Every thirty
days it always increases one foot *and* one-third, therefore about every
ten days the reckoning is always half a foot <span
id="fr_1963"></span>[1](#fn_1951), *and when* the sun is at the head of
Leo the shadow is seven <span id="fr_1964"></span>[2](#fn_1952) feet
*and* a half. 7. In this series every *zodiacal* constellation is
*treated* alike, and the months alike, until the sun comes unto the head
of Capricornus, *and* the shadow becomes fourteen feet and two parts. 8.
In Capricornus it diminishes again a foot *and* one-third <span
id="fr_1965"></span>[3](#fn_1953); *and* from there *where* it turns
back, because of the decrease of the night and increase of the day, it
always diminishes one foot *and* one-third every one of the months,
*and* about every ten days the reckoning is always half a foot, until it
comes back to six feet and two parts; every *zodiacal* constellation
*being treated* alike, and the months alike <span
id="fr_1966"></span>[4](#fn_1954).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1939"></span>[397:3](sbe0581.htm#fr_1951) The contents of
this chapter, regarding the lengths of midday and afternoon shadows,
immediately follow a tale of Gô*s*t-i Fryânô, which is appended to the
book of Ar*d*â-Vîrâf's journey to the other world, both in M6 and K20.
As will be seen from the notes, these details about shadows were
probably compiled at Yazd in Persia, as they are suitable only for that
latitude.

<span id="fn_1940"></span>[397:4](sbe0581.htm#fr_1952) Reading âya*d*-ae
(a very rare form), or it may be intended for hômanâe, 'should it be,'
but it is written in both MSS. exactly like the two ciphers for the
numeral 5. Mullâ Fîrûz in his Avî*g*eh Dîn, p. 279 seq., takes 5 khadûk
pâî as implying that the shadow is under the sole of the foot, or the
sun overhead; but neither this reading, nor the more literal 'one-fifth
of a foot,' can be reconciled with the other measures; though if we take
5 as standing for pan*g*ak, 'the five *toes* or sole,' we might
translate as follows: '*When* the sun is at Cancer, *the shadow* is the
sole of one foot of the man.'

<span id="fn_1941"></span>[398:1](sbe0581.htm#fr_1953) K20 has 'three'
by mistake.

<span id="fn_1942"></span>[398:2](sbe0581.htm#fr_1954) M6 omits 'and a
half' by mistake.

<span id="fn_1943"></span>[398:3](sbe0581.htm#fr_1955) K20 has 'six' by
mistake.

<span id="fn_1944"></span>[398:4](sbe0581.htm#fr_1956) Both MSS. omit
one cipher, and have only 'six,' but the shadow must be the same here as
at the fifteenth of Sagittarius.

<span id="fn_1945"></span>[398:5](sbe0581.htm#fr_1957) Both MSS. have
'seven,' which is clearly wrong.

<span id="fn_1946"></span>[398:6](sbe0581.htm#fr_1958) It is obvious
that, as the length of a man's shadow depends upon the height of the
sun, each of these observations of his noonday shadow determines the
altitude of the sun at noon, and is, therefore, a rude observation for
finding the latitude of the place, provided we know the ratio of a man's
foot to his stature. According to Bund. XXVI, 3 a man's stature is eight
spans (vitast), and according to Farh. Okh. p. 41 a vitast is twelve
finger-breadths, and a foot is fourteen (see Bund. XXVI, 3, note), so
that a man's stature of eight spans is equivalent to 6 6/7 feet.
Assuming this to have been the ratio adopted by the Observer, supposing
the obliquity of the ecliptic to have been 23° 35´ (as it <span
id="page_399">p. 399</span> was about A.D. 1000), and calculating the
latitude from each of the thirteen different lengths of shadow, the mean
result is 32° 1´ north latitude, which is precisely the position
assigned to Yazd (the head-quarters of the small remnant of Zoroastrians
in Persia) on some English maps, though some foreign maps place it 15´
or 20´ farther south. With regard to the rough nature of this mode of
observation it may be remarked that, as the lengths of the shadows are
noted only to half a foot, there is a possible error of a quarter-foot
in any of them; this would produce a possible error of 2° 4´ in the
midsummer observation of latitude, and of 39´ in the midwinter one; or a
mean possible error of 1° 22´ in any of the observations; so that the
possible error in the mean of thirteen observations is probably not more
than 6´, and the probable error is even less, provided the data have
been assumed correctly.

<span id="fn_1947"></span>[399:1](sbe0581.htm#fr_1959) Reading nipi*s*t,
but only the first and last letters are legible in M6, and the middle
letter is omitted in K20.

<span id="fn_1948"></span>[399:2](sbe0581.htm#fr_1960) See Bund. XXV, 9.

<span id="fn_1949"></span>[399:3](sbe0581.htm#fr_1961) The word sar,
'head,' usually means 'the end,' but it must be here taken as 'the
beginning;' perhaps, because the zodiacal signs are supposed to come
head-foremost.

<span id="fn_1950"></span>[399:4](sbe0581.htm#fr_1962) What portion of a
foot is meant by bâhar, 'part,' is doubtful. It can hardly be a quarter,
because 'two quarters' would be too clumsy a term for 'a half.' But it
appears from § 5-7 that the shadow, necessary to constitute the Aûzêrîn
period, is taken as increasing uniformly from six feet and two parts to
fourteen feet and two parts, an increase of eight feet in six months, or
exactly one foot and one-third per month, as stated in the text. And,
deducting this monthly increase of one feet and one-third from the seven
and a half feet shadow at the end of the first month, we have six feet
and one-sixth remaining for the shadow at the <span id="page_400">p.
400</span> beginning of the month. Hence we may conclude that the 'two
parts' are equal to one-sixth, and each 'part' is one-twelfth of a foot.

<span id="fn_1951"></span>[400:1](sbe0581.htm#fr_1963) Meaning that the
increase of shadow is to be taken into account as soon as it amounts to
half a foot, that is, about every ten days. Practically, half a foot
would be added on the tenth and twentieth days, and the remaining
one-third of a foot at the end of the month.

<span id="fn_1952"></span>[400:2](sbe0581.htm#fr_1964) Both MSS. have
'eight,' but this would be inconsistent with the context, as it is
impossible that 'six feet and two parts' can become 'eight feet and a
half' by the addition of 'one foot and one-third,' whatever may be the
value of the 'two parts' of a foot.

<span id="fn_1953"></span>[400:3](sbe0581.htm#fr_1965) Both MSS. have 3
yak-1 pâî, instead of pâî 3 yak-1.

<span id="fn_1954"></span>[400:4](sbe0581.htm#fr_1966) This mode of
determining the beginning of the afternoon period is not so clumsy as it
appears, as it keeps the length of that period exceedingly uniform for
the six winter months with some increase in the summer time. In latitude
32° north, where the longest day is about 13 hours 56 minutes, and the
shortest is 10 hours 4 minutes, these observations of a man's shadow
make the afternoon period begin about 3¾ hours before sunset at
mid-summer, <span id="page_401">p. 401</span> diminishing to 2¾ hours at
the autumnal equinox, and then remaining very nearly constant till the
vernal equinox.
