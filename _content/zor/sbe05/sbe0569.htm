<p>1. The greater H&acirc;sar is one part in twelve parts of the day and night, and the lesser H&acirc;sar is one part in eighteen parts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1549"></A><A HREF="#fn_1537"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

It is declared that, when a supreme high-priest (zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>trot&ucirc;m) passes away in idolatry, an apostate (aharm&ocirc;k) will be born in that dwelling, and a rumour of this calamity is uttered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1553"></A><A HREF="#fn_1541"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> by that supreme high-priest.</p>  
<p>4. In order to be steadfast in the good religion it is to be discussed with priests <I>and</I> high-priests, and when <I>one</I> does not discuss it is proper that he do not teach it.</p>

<p>7. Any one who shall die in a vessel (ka<I>s</I>t&icirc;k) it is allowable, for fear of contamination (pa<I>d</I>v&icirc;shak), to throw into the water; some say that the water itself is the receptacle for the dead (khaz&acirc;n&icirc;h).</p>  
<p>8. This, too, <I>is declared</I>: 'When in the dark it is not allowable to eat food; for the demons and fiends seize upon one-third of the wisdom and glory of him who eats food in the dark;' and it is declared by that passage (<I>g</I>&icirc;n&acirc;k) which A&ucirc;harmazd spoke to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, thus: 'After the departure of the light let him not devour, with unwashed hands, the water and vegetables of Horvada<I>d</I> and Amer&ocirc;da<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1556"></A><A HREF="#fn_1544"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; for if after the departure of the light thou devourest, with unwashed hands, the water and vegetables of Horvada<I>d</I> and Amer&ocirc;da<I>d</I>, the fiend seizes away from thee two-thirds of the existing original wisdom</p>

In every ceremonial (ya<I>z</I>i<I>s</I>n&#335;), at the beginning of the ceremony&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1561"></A><A HREF="#fn_1549"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and the beginning of the sacred-cake <I>consecration</I> (dr&ocirc;n)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1562"></A><A HREF="#fn_1550"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, the angels <I>and</I> guardian spirits of the righteous are to be invited to the ceremony. 12.

<P><A NAME="fn_1537"></A><A HREF="sbe0569.htm#fr_1549">308:3</A> The H&acirc;sar is not only a measure of distance (see Bund. XXVI, 1), but also a measure of time (see Bund. XXV, 5). According to the text here the greater H&acirc;sar must be two hours, and the lesser H&acirc;sar (which is not mentioned in M6) must be one hour and twenty minutes. But Farh. Okh. (P. 43) says, 'dvada-sang-h&acirc;threm asti aghrem ayare, "of twelve H&acirc;sars is the <A NAME="page_309"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 309</FONT></A> longest day;" the day and night in which is the longest day are twelve of the greatest H&acirc;sars, eighteen of the medium, and twenty-four of the least;' according to which statement there are three kinds of H&acirc;sar, that are respectively equivalent to two hours, one hour and twenty minutes, and one hour. As the longest day is said (Bund. XXV, 4) to be twice the length of the shortest day, and the greatest H&acirc;sar is twice the length of the least one, it may be conjectured that the H&acirc;sar varied with the length of the day, being a subdivision (one-eighth) of the time the sun was above, the horizon; this would account for the greatest and least H&acirc;sars, which are one-eighth of the longest and shortest days, respectively; but it does not account for the medium H&acirc;sar, which is not a mean between the two extremes, but one-ninth (instead of one-eighth) of the mean day of twelve hours. If the H&acirc;sar of distance were really a Parasang, as is sometimes stated, the connection between it and the H&acirc;sar of time would be obvious, as the average H&acirc;sar of one hour and twenty minutes is just the time requisite for walking a Parasang, which seems indeed to be stated in Farh. Okh. p. 42.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1545"></A><A HREF="sbe0569.htm#fr_1557">311:1</A> This passage does not appear to be now extant in the Avesta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1546"></A><A HREF="sbe0569.htm#fr_1558">311:2</A> This was the sixth nask or 'book' of the complete Mazdayasnian literature, according to the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I>d, which calls it P&acirc;<I>z</I>&icirc; or P&acirc;<I>z</I>ag; but according to the D&icirc;n&icirc;-va<I>g</I>arkar<I>d</I> and the Riv&acirc;yats it was the seventh nask, called P&acirc;<I>g</I>am. For its contents, as given by the D&icirc;n&icirc;-va<I>g</I>arkar<I>d</I>, see Haug's Essays, pp. 128, 129. The following is a short summary of the account of it given in the eighth book of the D&icirc;nkar<I>d</I> (that published in the Pahl.-P&acirc;z. Glossary, pp. 18 4, 185, being taken from the fifteenth nask, whose contents were mixed up with those of the seventh through the abstraction of several folios from the Iranian MS. of the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I>d before M13, or any other copy, was written in India):&#151;</p>  
<p>The P&acirc;<I>z</I>&icirc; (or P&acirc;<I>z</I>ag) is about the lawful slaughtering of animals in the ceremonial rites of fire and water at the season-festivals; also where, when, and how the festivals are to be celebrated, their advantages, and the duties of the officiating priests. The rotation of days, months, and years, summer and winter, the ten days at the end of the winter, when the guardian spirits visit the world, and the ceremonies to be then performed. The time for gathering medicinal plants. The retribution necessary for the various sins affecting the soul, the advantage of providing for such retribution, and the harm from not providing it. The thirty-three principal chiefs of the spiritual and worldly existences. The miracles of great good works, and the heinous sinfulness of apostasy. How far a wife can give away her husband's property, and when it is lawful for him to recover it. Whither winter flees when summer comes on, and where summer goes when winter comes on. The amount of disaster (v&ocirc;ighn) in one century, and the duration of everything connected with such disaster. The summer and winter months, the names of the twelve months, their meaning, and the angels they are devoted to; also the thirty days of the month, and the five G&acirc;tha days at the end of the year, when the guardian spirits are to be reverenced.</p>  
<p>The fifth fargar<I>d</I>, quoted in the text, was probably that portion of the Nask which described the duties of the officiating priests.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1547"></A><A HREF="sbe0569.htm#fr_1559">312:1</A> K20 has h&ucirc;zv&acirc;n, 'tongue, speech,' for z&icirc;f&acirc;n, 'faulty' (compare Pers. z&icirc;f, 'sin'), in all occurrences of the word.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1548"></A><A HREF="sbe0569.htm#fr_1560">312:2</A> K20 omits from this word to 'will approach' in the next clause of the sentence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1549"></A><A HREF="sbe0569.htm#fr_1561">312:3</A> That is, shortly before beginning the regular recitation of the Yasna, the angels, in whose honour the ceremony is being performed, are invited to approach by reciting their proper Khshn&ucirc;mans, or propitiatory formulas (see Chap. VII, 8, and Haug's Essays, p. 404).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1550"></A><A HREF="sbe0569.htm#fr_1562">312:4</A> This begins with Yas. III, 1, and the spirits are to be invited by adding their proper Khshn&ucirc;mans to those contained in Yas. III, 3-20 (see Haug's Essays, p. 408).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1551"></A><A HREF="sbe0569.htm#fr_1563">313:1</A> This may be at the 'staomi' of Yas. XII, 6, which is recited before the Yasna is commenced; but K20 alters the meaning (by inserting the relative particle) into '<I>they</I> are to be invoked at "staomi," the beginning of "all the guardian spirits of the righteous" (Yas. XXVI, 1).'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1552"></A><A HREF="sbe0569.htm#fr_1564">313:2</A> Yas. XXVI, 20.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1558"></A><A HREF="sbe0569.htm#fr_1570">313:8</A> Yas. XXII, 33 (&sect;&sect; 14-33 being recited twice). At this point the officiating priest brings out the mortar for pounding the H&ocirc;m twigs (see Haug's Essays, p. 405); Yas. XXII being called the beginning of the H&ocirc;m&acirc;st in the Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp Ya<I>s</I>t S&acirc;dah.</P>

The last clause is doubtful; the reading adopted here is <I>k</I>and zak-i shinav&acirc;k-<I>i</I> par andarg av&ecirc;n&acirc;k, as nothing more satisfactory suggests itself; it might also be translated by 'as much as the sound of a wing in the invisible.'</P>
