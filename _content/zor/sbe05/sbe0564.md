### CHAPTER IV

1\. A *sacred thread*-girdle (kûstîk), should it be made of silk
(parvand), is not proper; the hair (pashm) of a hairy goat and a hairy
camel is

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

proper, and from *other* hairy *creatures* (mûyînŏ) it is proper among
the lowly (nakhê*z*îk). 2. The least fulness <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1](#fn_1438) necessary for *it* is exactly three
finger-*breadths*; when it is exactly three finger-*breadths*
altogether <span id="fr_1448"></span>[2](#fn_1439) from one side, *and*
when the rest is cut off, it is proper. 3. When *one* retains the prayer
*inwardly* <span id="fr_1449"></span>[3](#fn_1440) and has tied his
girdle, and ties *it* anew once again, he will untie that which he has
tied, *and* it is not proper <span id="fr_1450"></span>[4](#fn_1441).

4\. Cloth of thick silk brocade (dîpâkŏ) and figured silk (parnîkânŏ) is
not good for girdling <span id="fr_1451"></span>[5](#fn_1442) and
*cloth* of hide when the hair is stripped from it of wool, of hair, of
cotton, of dyed silk, and of wood <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[6](#fn_1443) is proper for shirting (*s*apîkîh). 5.
Four finger-*breadths* of shirt <span id="fr_1453"></span>[7](#fn_1444)
is the measure of *its* width *away*

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

from each side, from the neck to the skirt (parîk); and *as to* the
length before and behind, as much as is proper to cover up is good. 6.
So much length and breadth, when it is double or thickened <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[1](#fn_1445), are not proper; when on the
separation (dûrmânak) of the two folds *one* remains clothed on one
side, both when he wears the girdle (kûstîk), *and* when he does not
wear the girdle, even then it is not undress (vishâ*d*akîh) <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[2](#fn_1446).

7\. When a shirt of one fold is put on, *and* the skirt has concealed
both sides, the girdle is tied over it, *and* it is proper. 8. When two
shirts are put on, and they shall tie the girdle over that which is
above, then *it* is for him a root of the sin owing to <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[3](#fn_1447) running about uncovered <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[4](#fn_1448).

9\. By a man and woman, until fifteen years of age, *there* is no
committal of *the sin of* running about uncovered <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[5](#fn_1449); *and* the sin of unseasonable

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

chatter <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1](#fn_1450) arises after fifteen
years of age <span id="fr_1460"></span>[2](#fn_1451). 10. The sin of
running about uncovered, as far as three steps; is a Farmân each step;
at the fourth step *it* is a Tanâpûhar <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[3](#fn_1452) *sin*.

11\. A girdle to which *there* is no fringe is proper; and when they
shall tie a woman's ringlet (gurs) <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[4](#fn_1453) *it* is not proper.

12\. Walking with one boot <span id="fr_1463"></span>[5](#fn_1454) as
far as four steps is

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

a Tanâpûhar *sin*, when with one <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1](#fn_1455)
movement; and after the fourth step as much as *one* shall walk is a
Tanâpûhar; and when he sits down and walks on the sin is the same that
*it would be* from his starting-point (bûnîh); and *there* were *some*
who said *it* is a Tanâpûhar for each league (parasang).

13\. At night, when they lie down, the shirt *and* girdle are to be
worn, for *they are* more protecting for the body, and good for the
soul. 14. When they lie down with the shirt and girdle, before sleep
*one* shall utter one Ashem-vohû <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[2](#fn_1456), and with every coming and going of
the breath (vayô) is a good work of three Srôshô-*k*aranâms <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[3](#fn_1457); and if in that

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

sleep decease occurs, his renunciation *of sin* is accomplished <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1](#fn_1458).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1438"></span>[286:1](sbe0564.htm#fr_1447) Literally,
'width;' that is, *extra* width, or slackness round the waist, as the
girdle sits very loosely over a loose shirt; or, as the text implies,
the slackness ought to admit three fingers together, projecting edgeways
from the waist. After tying it so loosely, any unnecessary length of
string may be cut off, when the girdle is put on for the first time. The
necessary looseness is again mentioned in Chap. X, 1.

<span id="fn_1439"></span>[286:2](sbe0564.htm#fr_1448) Literally,
'extreme to extreme;' rôê*s*man-â-rôê*s*man being Huzvâri*s* for
sarâsar.

<span id="fn_1440"></span>[286:3](sbe0564.htm#fr_1449) That is, has
begun the prayer formula (requisite while tying on the girdle) with a
bâ*z* or muttered prayer (see Chap. III, 6, note).

<span id="fn_1441"></span>[286:4](sbe0564.htm#fr_1450) The meaning
appears to be that he must not tie the girdle a second time without
recommencing the prayer formula.

<span id="fn_1442"></span>[286:5](sbe0564.htm#fr_1451) This word,
ayîbyâêghânîh, is chiefly a transcript from the Avesta name of the
kûstîk or girdle, aiwy*a*unghana. Probably garments in general are
meant.

<span id="fn_1443"></span>[286:6](sbe0564.htm#fr_1452) Perhaps dârîn may
mean cloth of bark, hemp, or flax here.

<span id="fn_1444"></span>[286:7](sbe0564.htm#fr_1453) The sacred shirt,
worn by Parsis of both sexes (young children excepted) in India, is a
very loose tunic of white muslin, with very short loose sleeves covering
part of the upper arm. It is called sadaro (Pers. sudarah) in
Gu*g*arâti, and shapîk (Pers. shabî) in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_1445"></span>[287:1](sbe0564.htm#fr_1454) Assuming that
aîtabarî*d* stands for astabarî*d*; the Huz. aît being substituted for
the Pâz. ast. The text appears to refer to lined or stuffed shirts, such
as would be very suitable for the cold winters of Persia, like the
clothing padded with cotton wool used by natives of the cooler parts of
India in the cold season.

<span id="fn_1446"></span>[287:2](sbe0564.htm#fr_1455) That is, the
degree of nakedness which is sinful (see §§ 8-10).

<span id="fn_1447"></span>[287:3](sbe0564.htm#fr_1456) K20 has lâ,
'not,' instead of râî, 'owing to;' this would reverse the meaning of the
sentence, but it is not the usual place for the negative particle.

<span id="fn_1448"></span>[287:4](sbe0564.htm#fr_1457) This sin is
called vishâ*d*-dûbâri*s*nîh; it is mentioned in Pahl. Vend. V, 167,
VII, 48, but not described there. The usual definition of the sin is
'walking about without the sacred thread-girdle;' and it is generally
classed with the two other Parsi sins of 'walking with one boot' and
'making water on foot' (see AV. XXV, 5, 6); sometimes a fourth Parsi
sin, 'unseasonable chatter,' is associated with them, as in the text,
but this is supposed to be punished in a different manner in hell (see
AV. XXIII).

<span id="fn_1449"></span>[287:5](sbe0564.htm#fr_1458) Indicating that
it is not absolutely necessary to wear the sacred thread-girdle till one
is fifteen years old (see Chap. X, 13).

<span id="fn_1450"></span>[288:1](sbe0564.htm#fr_1459) This sin is
called drâyân-gûyi*s*nîh, literally, 'eagerness for chattering,' and
consists in talking while eating, praying, or at any other time when a
prayer (vâ*g*) has been taken inwardly and is not yet spoken out; many
details regarding it are given in the next chapter. The sin consists in
breaking the spell, or destroying the effect, of the vâ*g*.

<span id="fn_1451"></span>[288:2](sbe0564.htm#fr_1460) This is modified
by Chap. V, 1, 2.

<span id="fn_1452"></span>[288:3](sbe0564.htm#fr_1461) See Chap. I, 1,
2. These particulars are deduced by the Pahlavi commentator from Vend.
XVIII, 115, which refers, however, to a special case of going without
girdle and shirt. He says (Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 116), 'so that as far as
the fourth step it is not more than (aî) a Srôshô-*k*aranâm, and at the
fourth step it amounts to the root of a Tanâpûhar within him; some say
that *he* is within what is allowed him in going three *steps*. When he
walks on very many steps it is also not more than a Tanâpûhar, *and*
when he stops again *it is counted* from the starting-point' (compare §
112).

<span id="fn_1453"></span>[288:4](sbe0564.htm#fr_1462) Probably
referring to the possibility of tying the girdle over a woman's hair,
when hanging loose down to her waist. The present custom among Parsi
women in India is to cover up the whole of their hair with a white
handkerchief tied closely over the head; but whether this is an ancient
custom is uncertain.

<span id="fn_1454"></span>[288:5](sbe0564.htm#fr_1463) This sin, which
is mentioned in Bund. XXVIII, 13, is called aê-mûk-dûbâri*s*nîh or
khadû-mûk-dûbâri*s*nîh, literally, 'running in one boot,' and is usually
so understood, but how there can be any risk of the committal of so
inconvenient an offence is not explained. Dastûr Hoshangji thinks that
aê-mûk, 'one boot,' was, formerly written avî-mûk, 'without boots;' and
no doubt avî is sometimes written exactly like khadû, 'one,'
(indicating, possibly, a phonetic change of avî into agvi). Perhaps,
however, the word alludes to the Persian practice of wearing an outer
boot <span id="page_289">p. 289</span> (mûk) over an inner one of
thinner leather, when walking out of doors; so that the sin of 'running
in one pair of boots' would be something equivalent to walking out in
one's stockings; and this seems all the more probable from the separate
account of-walking 'without boots or stockings,' avîmû*g*ak, given in
Chap. X, 12. But whatever may have been the original meaning of the
word, Parsis nowadays understand that it forbids their walking without
shoes; this should be recollected by any European official in India who
fancies that Parsis ought to take of their shoes in his presence, as by
insisting on such a practice he is compelling them to commit what they
believe to be a serious sin.

<span id="fn_1455"></span>[289:1](sbe0564.htm#fr_1464) Assuming that
hanâ, 'this,' stands for aê, 'one' (see p. 218, note 3). The amount of
sinfulness in walking improperly shod appears to be deduced from that
'incurred by walking improperly dressed (see § 10).

<span id="fn_1456"></span>[289:2](sbe0564.htm#fr_1465) See Bund. XX, 2.
The same details are given in Chap. X, 24.

<span id="fn_1457"></span>[289:3](sbe0564.htm#fr_1466) The Av.
sraoshô-*k*arana appears to have been a scourge with which offenders
were lashed by the assistant priests (see Vend. III, 125, 129, IV, 38,
&c.), and a Srôshô-*k*aranâm was, therefore, originally one lash with a
scourge. As the gravity of an offence was measured by the number of
lashes administered, when this term was transferred from the temporal to
the spiritual gravity of sin, it was considered as the unit of weight by
which sins were estimated; and, by a further process of reasoning, the
good works <span id="page_290">p. 290</span> necessary for
counterbalancing sins were estimated by the same unit of weight.
Regarding the amount of a Srôshô-*k*aranâm there is much uncertainty;
according to Chap. XVI, 5 and Pahl. Vend. VI, 15 it is the same as a
Farmân, and this appears to be the case also from a comparison of § 10
with Pahl. Vend. XVIII, 116 (see note on § 10); but according to Chap.
XI, 2 it is half a Farmân, and the Farmân is also probably the degree
meant by the frequent mention of three Srôshô-*k*aranâms as the least
weight of sin or good works that will turn the scale in which the soul's
actions are weighed after death (see Chap. VI, 3). This uncertainty may
perhaps have arisen from aê, 'one,' and the cipher 3 being often written
alike in Pahlavi. But, besides this uncertainty, there is some
discordance between the various accounts of the actual weight of a
Srôshô-*k*aranâm, as may be seen in Chaps. X, 24, XI, 2, XVI, 5. As a
weight the Srôshô-*k*aranâm is not often mentioned in the Pahlavi
Vendidad, for wherever it translates the Av. sraoshô-*k*arana it means
'lashes with a scourge;' but the weight of one Srôshô-*k*aranâm is
mentioned in Pahl. Vend. VI, 15, three Srôshô-*k*aranâms in IV, 142,
VII, 136, XVII, 11, XVIII, 55, 116, and five Srôshô-*k*aranâms in XVI,
8.

<span id="fn_1458"></span>[290:1](sbe0564.htm#fr_1467) Patîtîkîh, 'the
dropping' or renunciation of sin, is effected by confessing serious
offences to a high-priest, and also by the recitation of a particular
formula called the Patit, in which every imaginable sin is mentioned
with a declaration of repentance of any such sins as the reciter may
have committed. The priest ordains such atonement as he thinks
necessary, but the remission of the sins depends upon the after
performance of the atonement and the effectual determination to avoid
such sins in future (see Chap. VIII, 1, 2, 8).
