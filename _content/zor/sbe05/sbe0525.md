### CHAPTER XVI.

1\. On the nature of generation it says in revelation, that a woman when
she comes out from menstruation, during ten days and nights, when they
go near unto her, soon becomes pregnant. 2. When she is cleansed from
her menstruation, *and* when the time for pregnancy has come, always
when the seed of the man is the more powerful a son arises from it; when
that of the woman is the more powerful, a daughter; when both seeds are
equal, twins and triplets. 3. If the male seed comes the sooner, it adds
to the female, and she becomes robust; if the female seed comes the
sooner, it becomes blood, *and* the leanness of the female *arises*
therefrom.

4\. The female seed is cold and moist, and *its* flow is from the loins,
and the colour is white, red, and yellow; and the male seed is hot and
dry, *its* flow is from the brain of the head, *and* the colour is white
and mud-coloured (ha*s*gûn). 5. All <span
id="fr_305"></span>[1](#fn_304) the seed of the females *which* issues
beforehand, takes a place within the womb, and the seed of the males
will remain above it, *and* will fill the space of the womb; whatever
refrains therefrom becomes blood again, enters into the veins of the
females, *and* at the time any one is born it becomes milk and'

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

nourishes him, as all milk arises from the seed of the males, *and* the
blood is that of the females.

6\. These four things, they say, are male, *and these* female: the sky,
metal, wind, *and* fire are male, and are never otherwise; the water,
earth, plants, *and* fish are female, *and* are never otherwise; the
remaining creation consists of male and female.

7\. As regards the fish <span id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_305) it says
that, at the time of excitement, they go forwards and come back in the
water, two *and* two, the length of a mile (hâsar), which is one-fourth
of a league (parasang), in the running water; in that coming *and* going
they then rub *their* bodies *together*, and a kind of sweat drops out
betwixt them, and *both* become pregnant.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_304"></span>[60:1](sbe0525.htm#fr_305) M6 has 'always.'

<span id="fn_305"></span>[61:1](sbe0525.htm#fr_306) K20 has 'the male
fish,' which is inconsistent with the preceding sentence.
