<P><A NAME="fn_531"></A><A HREF="sbe0535.htm#fr_536">98:1</A> Av. h&acirc;thra of Vend. II, 65, VIII, 280, 287, 291, T&icirc;<I>s</I>tar Yt. 23, 29. The statements regarding the length of a H&acirc;sar are rather perplexing, for we are told that it 'is like a Parasang' (Chap. XIV, 4), that 'the length of a H&acirc;sar is one-fourth of a Parasang' (Chap. XVI, 7), and that 'a medium H&acirc;sar on the ground, which they also call a Parasang, is a thousand steps of the two feet when walking with propriety' (Farhang-i O&icirc;m-khad&ucirc;k, ed. Hosh. p. 42). To reconcile these statements we must conclude that the H&acirc;sar is like a Parasang merely in the sense of being a long measure of distance, that it is really the mille passus or mile of the Romans, and that it is a quarter of the actual Parasang. At the same time, as it was usual to call a H&acirc;sar by the name of a Parasang, we are often left in doubt whether a mile or a league is meant, when a H&acirc;sar or Parasang is mentioned. The Farhang-i O&icirc;m-khad&ucirc;k (p. 41) also mentions other measures of distance, such as the ta<I>k</I>ar (Av. ta<I>k</I>ara) of two H&acirc;sars, the asv&acirc;st (or a&ecirc;ast) of four H&acirc;sars, the dashm&ecirc;st (Av. dakhshmaiti) of eight, H&acirc;sars, and the y&ocirc;<I>g</I>&ecirc;st (Av. yi<I>g</I>aiasti or yu<I>g</I>aiasti) of sixteen H&acirc;sars.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_532"></A><A HREF="sbe0535.htm#fr_537">98:2</A> A Parasang is usually from 3&frac12; to 4 English miles, but perhaps a H&acirc;sar is meant here.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_533"></A><A HREF="sbe0535.htm#fr_538">98:3</A> Reading vitast-i miy&acirc;nak instead of vitast dam&acirc;nak. The Farhang-i O&icirc;m-khad&ucirc;k (p. 41) mentions three kinds of spans, the Av. vitasti (Vend. VIII, 243, 245, XVII, 13) of twelve finger-breadths (ang&ucirc;st), or about 9 inches, which is a full span between the thumb and little finger (the one mentioned in the text); the Av. di<I>s</I>ti (Vend. XVII, 13) of ten finger-breadths, or about 7&frac12; inches, which is a span between the thumb and middle finger; and the <A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A> Av. uza<I>s</I>ti (Pahl. l&acirc;l&acirc;-a<I>s</I>t) of eight finger-breaths, or about 6 inches which is a span between the thumb and fore-finger. Other measures mentioned by the same authority are the p&acirc;&icirc; (Av. padha, Vend. IX, 15, 20, 29), 'foot,' of fourteen finger-breadths, or about 10&frac12; inches; the g&acirc;m (Av. g&acirc;ya, Vend. III, 57, &amp;c.), 'step,' which 'in the Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d is three p&acirc;&icirc;,' or about 2 feet 7&frac12; inches, 'and in other places is said <I>to be</I> two fr&acirc;r&acirc;st' (Av. fr&acirc;r&acirc;thni in Vend. VII, 76, 79, 87); so the fr&acirc;r&acirc;st, which is probably the distance from the neck to the extended elbow, is half a g&acirc;m, or from 15 to 16 inches. Two other measures are mentioned in Vend. VII, 7 9, 87, 90, IX, 8, the Av. fr&acirc;b&acirc;zu, 'fore-arm or cubit' from elbow to finger-ends, which is about 18 inches (or it may be a half fathom); and Av. v&icirc;b&acirc;zu, which is probably the 'fathom,' or extent of the two arms out-stretched, from 5&frac12; to 6 feet.</P>
