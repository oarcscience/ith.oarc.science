<p>1. On the nature of generation it says in revelation, that a woman when she comes out from menstruation, during ten days and nights, when they go near unto her, soon becomes pregnant. 2. When she is cleansed from her menstruation, <I>and</I> when the time for pregnancy has come, always when the seed of the man is the more powerful a son arises from it; when that of the woman is the more powerful, a daughter; when both seeds are equal, twins and triplets. 3. If the male seed comes the sooner, it adds to the female, and she becomes robust; if the female seed comes the sooner, it becomes blood, <I>and</I> the leanness of the female <I>arises</I> therefrom.</p>  
<p>4. The female seed is cold and moist, and <I>its</I> flow is from the loins, and the colour is white, red, and yellow; and the male seed is hot and dry, <I>its</I> flow is from the brain of the head, <I>and</I> the colour is white and mud-coloured (ha<I>s</I>g&ucirc;n). 5. All&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the seed of the females <I>which</I> issues beforehand, takes a place within the womb, and the seed of the males will remain above it, <I>and</I> will fill the space of the womb; whatever refrains therefrom becomes blood again, enters into the veins of the females, <I>and</I> at the time any one is born it becomes milk and'</p>

<p>nourishes him, as all milk arises from the seed of the males, <I>and</I> the blood is that of the females.</p>  
<p>6. These four things, they say, are male, <I>and these</I> female: the sky, metal, wind, <I>and</I> fire are male, and are never otherwise; the water, earth, plants, <I>and</I> fish are female, <I>and</I> are never otherwise; the remaining creation consists of male and female.</p>  
<p>7. As regards the fish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> it says that, at the time of excitement, they go forwards and come back in the water, two <I>and</I> two, the length of a mile (h&acirc;sar), which is one-fourth of a league (parasang), in the running water; in that coming <I>and</I> going they then rub <I>their</I> bodies <I>together</I>, and a kind of sweat drops out betwixt them, and <I>both</I> become pregnant.</p>
