<p>3. The seed of the ox was carried up to the moon station&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; there it was thoroughly purified, <I>and</I> produced the manifold species of animals&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 4. First, two oxen, one male and one female, and, afterwards, one pair of every single species was let go into the earth, <I>and</I> was discernible in A&icirc;r&acirc;n-v&ecirc;<I>g</I> <I>for</I> a H&acirc;sar ('mile'), which is like a Parasang ('league')&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; as it says, that, on account of the valuableness of the ox, it was created twice, one time as an ox, and one time as the manifold species of animals. 5. A thousand days and nights they were without eating, and first water and afterwards herbage (a&ucirc;rvar) were devoured by them.</p>  
<p>6. And, afterwards, the three classes (kar<I>d</I>ak) of animals were produced therefrom, as it says that first were the goat and sheep, and then the camel</p>

<p>and swine, and then the horse and ass. 7. For, first, <I>those</I> suitable for grazing were created therefrom, those are now kept in the valley (l&acirc;&icirc;); the second created were those of the hill summits (sar-i d&ecirc;<I>z</I>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which are wide-travellers, <I>and</I> habits (nih&acirc;dak) are not taught to them by hand; the third created were <I>those</I> dwelling in the water.</p>  
<p>8. As for the genera (khad&ucirc;&icirc;nak), the first genus is that which <I>has</I> the foot cloven in two, <I>and is</I> suitable for grazing; of which a camel larger than a horse is small <I>and</I> new-born. 9. The second genus is ass-footed, of which the swift&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> horse is the largest, <I>and</I> the ass the least. 10. The third genus is that of the five-dividing paw, of which the dog is the largest, <I>and</I> the civet-cat the least. 11. The fourth genus is the flying, of which the griffon of three natures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is the largest, and the chaffinch&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the least. 12. The fifth genus is that of the water, of which the Kar fish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is the largest, <I>and</I> the Nemadu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> the least.</p>

<p>two hundred and eighty-two&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> species (sar<I>d</I>ak). 14. First are five species of goat, the ass-goat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the milch-goat, the mountain-goat, the fawn, <I>and</I> the <I>common</I> goat. 15. Second, five species of sheep, that with a tail, that which has no tail, the dog-sheep, the wether, <I>and</I> the K&ucirc;ri<I>s</I>k sheep, a sheep whose horn is great; it possesses a grandeur&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> like unto a horse, <I>and</I> they use <I>it</I> mostly for a steed (b&acirc;ra), as it is said that M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har kept a K&ucirc;ri<I>s</I>k as a steed. 16. Third, two species of camel, the mountain <I>one and that</I> suitable for grazing; for one is fit to keep in the mountain, <I>and</I> one in the plain; they are one-humped <I>and</I> two-humped. 17. Fourth, fifteen species of ox, the white, mud-coloured&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, red, yellow, black, <I>and</I> dappled, the elk, the buffalo, the camel-leopard ox, the fish-chewing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> ox, the Far<I>s</I> ox, the Ka<I>g</I><I>a</I>u, <I>and</I> other species of ox. 18.

Seventh, five species of the black&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> hare; two are wild species, one dwelling in a burrow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> <I>and</I> one dwelling in the jungle. 21.

Tenth, one hundred and ten species of birds; flying creatures (vey = v&acirc;&icirc;) such as the griffon bird&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the Kar<I>s</I>ipt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the eagle, the Kahrk&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> which they call the vulture, the crow, the Ard&acirc;, the crane, <I>and</I> the tenth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> is the bat. 24. There are two of them which have milk in the teat <I>and</I> suckle <I>their</I> young, the griffon bird and the bat which flies in the night; as they say that the bat is created of three races (sar<I>d</I>ak), the race (&acirc;yina) of the dog, the bird, <I>and</I> the musk <I>animal</I>; for it flies like a bird, has many teeth like a dog, <I>and</I> is dwelling in holes like a musk-rat. 25. These hundred and ten species of birds are distributed into eight groups (khad&ucirc;&icirc;nak), mostly as scattered about as when a man scatters seed, <I>and</I> drops the seed in <I>his</I> fingers to the ground, large, middling, <I>and</I> small. 26.

Afterwards, within each species, species within species are created, so the total is two hundred and eighty-two species&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>28. Of the dog they say that out of the star station, that is, <I>away</I> from the direction of the constellation Hapt&ocirc;k-r&icirc;ng, was given to him further by a stage (y&ocirc;<I>g</I>ist)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> than to men, on account of <I>his</I> protection of sheep, <I>and</I> as associating with sheep <I>and</I> men; for this the dog is purposely adapted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, as three more kinds of advantage are given to him than <I>to</I> man, <I>he has</I> his own boots, his own clothing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> may wander about without self-exertion. 29.

A&ucirc;harmazd said when the bird V&acirc;resha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> was created by him, <I>which</I> is a bird of prey, thus: 'Thou art created by me, O bird V&acirc;resha! so that my vexation may be greater than <I>my</I> satisfaction with thee, for thou doest the will of the evil spirit more than that of me; like the wicked man who did not become satiated with wealth, thou also dost not become satiated with the slaughter of birds; but if thou be not created by me, O bird V&acirc;resha! thou wouldst be created by him, the evil spirit, <I>as</I> a kite&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with the body of a Varpa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, by which no creature would be left alive.'</p>

It has been generally supposed that we should read 'eleventh,' and consider the bats as an eleventh group, especially as the MSS. call the next group (the fish) the 'twelfth;' but this view is contradicted by the remarks about the bats being mingled with those about the birds, and also by Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam in his Selections, Chap. IX, 14 (see App. to Bund.), not mentioning any group of bats among the other animals.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_264"></A><A HREF="sbe0523.htm#fr_265">50:6</A> All the MSS. have 'twelfth,' but they give no 'eleventh' nor 'thirteenth,' though they have 'fourteenth' in &sect; 29.

The actual total number of species mentioned is 186, leaving ninety-six for the 'species within species.' Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam in his Selections, Chap. IX, 14, differs from the numbers given in the text merely in giving ten species of ox, instead of fifteen; so the total of his details is 181, leaving 101 sub-species to make up his; grand total of 282 (see App. to Bund.)</P>

XXVI, 1). This sentence seems to imply that on account of the useful qualities of the dog he has a part of the lowermost grade of paradise allotted to him, further from the demon-haunted north than that allotted to the men whose inferior order of merit does not entitle them to enter the higher grades of paradise.</P>
