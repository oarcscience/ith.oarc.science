### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1968"></span>[404:3](sbe0583.htm#fr_1980) Two versions of
this chapter, detailing the qualities of the <span id="page_405">p.
405</span> thirty angels and archangels, are extant; one in M6, which
has lost §§ 3-5, and the other in a very old MS. in the library of the
high-priest of the Parsis at Bombay. This latter, being complete, is
here taken as the text, while the variations of M6, which occur in
nearly every epithet, are given in the notes. Which version is the
oldest can hardly be ascertained with certainty from the state of the
MSS. M6 omits this opening benediction.

<span id="fn_1969"></span>[405:1](sbe0583.htm#fr_1981) M6 has 'more
nimble.'

<span id="fn_1970"></span>[405:2](sbe0583.htm#fr_1982) M6 has 'more
discriminative.'

<span id="fn_1971"></span>[405:3](sbe0583.htm#fr_1983) M6 has 'more
active.'

<span id="fn_1972"></span>[405:4](sbe0583.htm#fr_1984) M6 has 'more
complete.'

<span id="fn_1973"></span>[405:5](sbe0583.htm#fr_1985) M6 has 'fatter.'

<span id="fn_1974"></span>[405:6](sbe0583.htm#fr_1986) M6 has 'more
fruitful.'

<span id="fn_1975"></span>[405:7](sbe0583.htm#fr_1987) M6 has 'Dînô is
more desirous.'

<span id="fn_1976"></span>[405:8](sbe0583.htm#fr_1988) M6 has 'more
heating.'

<span id="fn_1977"></span>[405:9](sbe0583.htm#fr_1989) Referring perhaps
to the golden channels (Bund. XIII, 4, 5) through which the water of
Arêdvîvsûr (a title of the angel Â*v*ân, waters') is supposed to flow.
M6 has 'more glittering.'

<span id="fn_1978"></span>[405:10](sbe0583.htm#fr_1990) M6 has 'more
embellished.'

<span id="fn_1979"></span>[405:11](sbe0583.htm#fr_1991) M6 has
varpântar, the meaning of which is uncertain.

<span id="fn_1980"></span>[405:12](sbe0583.htm#fr_1992) M6 has 'more
listening.'

<span id="fn_1981"></span>[405:13](sbe0583.htm#fr_1993) The version in
M6 ends here; the next folio being lost.

<span id="fn_1982"></span>[405:14](sbe0583.htm#fr_1994) The same as
Arshi*s*ang (see Bund. XXII, 4).

<span id="fn_1983"></span>[406:1](sbe0583.htm#fr_1995) The reading of
both these nouns is uncertain. The days of the Parsi month, which bear
the names of these thirty angels, are divided, it will be observed, into
four nearly equal divisions, resembling weeks, which are here separated
in §§ 1-4. The first weekly period begins with a day dedicated to
Aûharmazd, and called by his own name; and each of the three other
weekly periods also begins with a day dedicated to Aûharmazd, but called
by the name of Dîn, 'religion,' with the name of the following day added
as a cognomen. The first week, therefore, consists of the day Aûharmazd
followed by six days named after the six archangels respectively (see
Bund. I, 23, 26). The second week consists of the day Dîn-with-Âtarô
followed by six days named after the angels of fire, waters, the sun,
the moon, Mercury, and the primeval ox. The third week consists of the
day Dîn-with-Mitrô followed by seven days named after the angels of
solar light, obedience, and justice, the guardian spirits, and the
angels of victory, pleasure, and wind. And the fourth week consists of
the day Dîn-with-Dînô followed by seven days named after the angels of
religion, righteousness, rectitude, the sky, the earth, the liturgy, and
the fixed stars.
