<p>In the early twentieth century Charles Fort put together
great quantities of exhaustively documented 'puzzling evidence.'
This is data which science is unable or unwilling to
explain, such rains of fish or blood, mysterious animals, 
or manufactured artifacts in deep strata.
Fort collected numerous accounts of aerial phenomena prior to
the invention of aviation, including huge cylinders and spheres
in the sky.
Many of these would today be considered <A HREF="../ufo/index.htm">UFOs</A>.

1941 Thayer one-volume edition of Fort's works.
