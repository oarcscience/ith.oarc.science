### <span id="v.i.x-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XI. How during the reign of Honorius, Gratian and Constantine were created tyrants in Britain; and soon after the former was slain in Britain, and the latter in Gaul. \[407 A.D.\]

<span id="v.i.x-p1"></span>IN the year of our Lord 407, Honorius, the
younger son of Theodosius, and the forty-fourth from Augustus, being
emperor, two years before the invasion of Rome by Alaric, king of the
Goths, when the nations of the Alani, Suevi, Vandals, and many others
with them, having defeated the Franks and passed the Rhine, ravaged all
Gaul, Gratianus, a citizen of the country, was set up as tyrant in
Britain and killed. In his place, Constantine, one of the meanest
soldiers, only for the hope afforded by his name, and without any worth
to recommend him, was chosen emperor. As soon as he had taken upon him
the command, he crossed over into Gaul, where being often imposed upon
by the barbarians with untrustworthy treaties, he did more harm than
good to the Commonwealth. Whereupon Count Constantius, by the command of
Honorius, marching into Gaul with an army, besieged him in the city of
Arles, took him prisoner, and put him to death. His son Constans, a
monk, whom he had created Caesar, was also put to death by his own
follower Count Gerontius, at Vienne.

<span id="v.i.x-p2"></span>Rome was taken by the Goths, in the year from
its foundation, 1164. Then the Romans ceased to rule in Britain, almost
470 years after Caius Julius Caesar came to the island. They dwelt
within the rampart, which, as we have mentioned, Severus made across the
island, on the south side of it, as the cities, watch-towers, bridges,
and paved roads there made testify to this day; but they had a right of
dominion over the farther parts of Britain, as also over the islands
that are beyond Britain.
