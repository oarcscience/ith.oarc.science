### <span id="v.i.ix-p0.1"></span>CHAP. X. How, in the reign of Arcadius, Pelagius, a Briton, insolently impugned the Grace of God. \[395 AD\]

<span id="v.i.ix-p1"></span>In the year of our Lord 394, Arcadius, the
son of Theodosius, the forty-third from Augustus, succeeding to the
empire, with his brother Honorius, held it thirteen years. In his time,
Pelagius, \[Pelagius, the founder of the heresy known as Pelagianism,
was probably born in 370 A.D., and is said to have been a Briton. His
great opponent, St. Augustine, speaks of him as a good and holy man;
later slanders are to be attributed to Jerome’s abusive language. The
cardinal point in his doctrine is his denial of original sin, involving
a too great reliance on the human will in achieving holiness, and a
limitation of the action of the grace of God\] a Briton, spread far and
near the infection of his perfidious doctrine, denying the assistance of
the Divine grace, being seconded therein by his associate Julianus of
Campania, who was impelled by an uncontrolled desire to recover his
bishopric, of which he had been deprived. St . Augustine, and the other
orthodox fathers, quoted many thousand catholic authorities against
them, but failed to amend their folly; nay, more, their madness being
rebuked was rather increased by contradiction than suffered by them to
be purified through adherence to the truth; which Prosper, the
rhetorician, has beautifully expressed thus in heroic" verse :—

<span id="v.i.ix-p2"></span>"They tell that one, erewhile consumed with
gnawing spite, snake-like attacked Augustine in his writings. Who urged
the wretched viper to raise from the ground his head, howsoever hidden
in dens of darkness? Either the sea-girt Britons reared him with the
fruit of their soil, or fed on Campanian pastures his heart swells with
pride."

were created tyrants in Britain; and soon after the former was slain in
Britain, and the latter in Gaul. \[407 A.D.\]](hist013)
