### <span id="v.i.viii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. IX. How during the reign of Gratian, Maximus, being created Emperor in Britain, returned into Gaul with a mighty army. \[377 AD\]

<span id="v.i.viii-p1"></span>In the year of our Lord 377, Gratian, the
fortieth from Augustus, held the empire for six years after the death of
Valens; though he had long before reigned with his uncle Valens, and his
brother Valentinian. Finding the condition of the commonwealth much
impaired, and almost gone to ruin, and impelled by the necessity of
restoring it, he invested the Spaniard, Theodosius, with the purple at
Sirmium, and made him emperor of Thrace and the Eastern provinces. At
that time, Maximus, a man of energy and probity, and worthy of the title
of Augustus, if he had not broken his oath of allegiance, was made
emperor by the army somewhat against his will, passed over into Gaul,
and there by treachery slew the Emperor Gratian, who in consternation at
his sudden invasion, was attempting to escape into Italy. His brother,
the Emperor Valentinian, expelled from Italy, fled into the East, where
he was entertained by Theodosius with fatherly affection, and soon
restored to the empire, for Maximus the tyrant, being shut up in
Aquileia, was there taken by them and put to death.
