<span id="v.v.xxiii-p55"></span> THUS much of the Ecclesiastical History
of Britain, and more especially of the English nation, as far as I could
learn either from the writings of the ancients, or the tradition of our
forefathers, or of my own knowledge, with the help of the Lord, I, Bede,
the servant of Christ, and priest of the monastery of the blessed
Apostles, Peter and Paul, which is at Wearmouth and Jarrow, have set
forth. Having been born in the territory of that same monastery, I was
given, by the care of kinsmen, at seven years of age, to be educated by
the most reverend Abbot Benedict, and afterwards by Ceolfrid, and
spending all the remaining time of my life a dweller in that monastery,
I wholly applied myself to the study of Scripture; and amidst the
observance of monastic rule, and the daily charge of singing in the
church, I always took delight in learning, or teaching, or writing. In
the nineteenth year of my age, I received deacon’s orders; in the
thirtieth, those of the priesthood, both of them by the ministry of the
most reverend Bishop John, and at the bidding of the Abbot Ceolfrid.
From the time when I received priest’s orders, till the fifty-ninth year
of my age, I have made it my business, for my own needs and those of my
brethren, to compile out of the works of the venerable Fathers, the
following brief notes on the Holy Scriptures, and also to make some
additions after the manner of the meaning and interpretation given by
them:

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p56"></span>On the Beginning of Genesis, to the
birth of Isaac and the casting out of Ishmael, four books.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p57"></span>Concerning the Tabernacle and its
Vessels, and of the Vestments of the Priests, three books.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p58"></span>On the first part of Samuel, to the
Death of Saul, three books.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p59"></span>Concerning the Building of the Temple,
of Allegorical Exposition, and other matters, two books.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p60"></span>Likewise on the Book of Kings, thirty
Questions.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p74"></span>Of Homilies on the Gospel, two books.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p75"></span>On the Apostle, (ie Paul) whatsoever I
have found in the works of St. Augustine I have taken heed to transcribe
in order.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p76"></span>On the Acts of the Apostles, two books.
On the seven Catholic Epistles, a book on each. On the Revelation of St.
John, three books. Likewise, Chapters of Lessons on all the New
Testament, except the Gospel.

be visited" ; one of the Reason of Leap-Year, and one of the Equinox,
according to Anatolius. (see III,3)

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p78"></span>Likewise concerning the Histories of
Saints: I translated the Book of the Life and Passion of St. Felix,
Confessor, from the metrical work of Paulinus, into prose; the Book of
the Life and Passion of St. Anastasius, which was ill translated from
the Greek, and worse amended by some ignorant person, I have corrected
as to the sense as far as I could; I have written the Life of the Holy
Father Cuthbert, (see IV, 26-32) who was both monk and bishop, first in
heroic verse, and afterwards in prose.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p85"></span>A book of Orthography arranged in
Alphabetical Order.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p86"></span>Likewise a Book of the Art of Poetry,
and to it I have added another little Book of Figures of Speech or
Tropes; that is, of the Figures and Modes of Speech in which the Holy
Scriptures are written.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p87"></span>And I beseech Thee, good Jesus, that to
whom Thou hast graciously granted sweetly to drink in the words of Thy
knowledge, Thou wilt also vouchsafe in Thy loving-kindness that he may
one day come to Thee, the Fountain of all wisdom, and appear for ever
before Thy face.

## <span id="v.v.xxiii-p87.1"></span>The Continuation of Bede.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p88"></span>(ie a continuation of the annotated
history of Bede, written by a later hand, except, perhaps entries under
the years 731, 732, 733 and 734 which Mr Plummer believes were added by
Bede himself.)

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p89"></span>IN the year 731 King Ceolwulf was taken
prisoner, and tonsured, and sent back to his kingdom; Bishop Acca was
driven from his see.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p90"></span>In the year 732, Egbert was made Bishop
of York, in the room of Wilfrid. \[Cynibert Bishop of Lindsey died.\]

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p91"></span>\[In the year of our Lord 733,
Archbishop Tatwine, having received the pall by Apostolic authority,
ordained Alwic and Sigfrid, bishops.\]

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p92"></span>In the year 733, there was an eclipse of
the sun on the 14th day of August about the third hour, in such wise
that the whole orb of the sun seemed to be covered with a black and
gloomy shield.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p93"></span>In the year 734, the moon, on the 31st
of January, about the time of cock-crowing, was, for about a whole hour,
coloured blood-red, after which a blackness followed, and she regained
her wonted light.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p94"></span>the year from the Incarnation of Christ,
734, bishop Tatwine died.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p95"></span>In the year 735, Nothelm was ordained
archbishop; and bishop Egbert, having received the pall from the
Apostolic see, was the first to be established as archbishop after
Paulinus, and he ordained Frithbert, and Frithwald bishops; and the
priest Bede died.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p96"></span>In the year 737, an excessive drought
rendered the land unfruitful; and Ceolwulf, voluntarily receiving the
tonsure, left the kingdom to Eadbert.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p97"></span>In the year 739, Edilhart, king of the
West-Saxons, died, as did Archbishop Nothelm.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p98"></span>In the year 740, Cuthbert was

and wrongfully wasted part of Northumbria, their king, Eadbert, with his
army, being employed against the Picts. Bishop Ethelwald died also, and
Conwulf, was consecrated in his stead. Arnwin and Eadbert were slain.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p99"></span>In the year 741, a great drought came

Caroloman and Pippin, reigned in his stead.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p100"></span>In the year 745, Bishop Wilfrid and
Ingwald, Bishop of London, departed to the Lord.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p101"></span>In the year 747, the man of God,
Herefrid, died.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p102"></span>In the year 750, Cuthred, king of the
West Saxons, rose up against king Ethelbald and Oengus; Theudor and
Eanred died Eadbert added the plain of Kyle and other places to his
dominions.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p103"></span>In the year 753, in the fifth year of
King Eadbert, on the 9th of January, an eclipse of the sun came to pass;
afterwards, in the same year and month, on the 24th day of January, the
moon suffered an eclipse, being covered with a gloomy, black shield, in
like manner as was the sun a little while before.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p104"></span>In the year 754, Boniface, called also
Winfrid, Bishop of the Franks, received the crown of martyrdom, together
with fifty-three others; and Redger was consecrated archbishop in his
stead, by pope Stephen.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p105"></span>In the year 757, Ethelbald, king of the
Mercians, was treacherously and miserably murdered, in the night, by his
own guards; Beornred began his reign; Cyniwulf, king of the West Saxons,
died; and the same year, Offa, having put Beornred to flight, sought to
gain the kingdom of the Mercians by bloodshed.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p106"></span>In the year 758, Eadbert, king of the
Northumbrians, receiving St. Peter’s tonsure for the love of God, and to
the end that he might take the heavenly country by force, left the
kingdom to his son Oswulf.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p107"></span>In the year 755, Oswulf was wickedly
murdered by his own thegns; and Ethelwald, being chosen the same year by
his people, entered upon the kingdom; in whose second year there was
great tribulation by reason of pestilence, which continued almost, two
years, divers grievous sicknesses raging, but more especially the
disease of dysentery.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p108"></span>In the year 761, Oengus, king of the
Picts, died; who, from the beginning to the end of his reign, continued
to be a blood-stained and tyrannical butcher; Oswin was also slain.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p109"></span>In the year 765, King Aluchred came to
the throne.

<span id="v.v.xxiii-p110"></span>In the year 766 A.D., Archbishop
Egbert, of the royal race, and endued with divine knowledge, as also
Frithbert, both of them truly faithful bishops, departed to the Lord.
