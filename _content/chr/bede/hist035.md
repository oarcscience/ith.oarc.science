### <span id="v.i.xxxii-p0.1"></span>CHAP. XXXIII. How Augustine repaired the church of our Saviour, and built the monastery of the blessed Peter the Apostle; and concerning Peter the first abbot of the same.

<span id="v.i.xxxii-p1"></span>Augustine having had his episcopal see
granted him in the royal city, as has been said, recovered therein, with
the support of the king, a church, which he was informed had been built
of old by the faithful among the Romans, and consecrated it in the name
of the Holy Saviour, our Divine Lord Jesus Christ, and there established
a residence for himself and all his successors.’ He also built a
monastery not far from the city to the eastward, in which, by his
advice, Ethelbert erected from the foundation the church of the blessed
Apostles, Peter and Paul, and enriched it with divers gifts; wherein the
bodies of the same Augustine, and of all the bishops of Canterbury, and
of the kings of Kent, might be buried. Nevertheless, it was not
Augustine himself who consecrated that church, but Laurentius, his
successor.

<span id="v.i.xxxii-p2"></span>The first abbot of that monastery was the
priest Peter, who, being sent on a mission into Gaul, was drowned in a
bay of the sea, which is called Amfleat, and committed to a humble tomb
by the inhabitants of the place; but since it was the will of Almighty
God to reveal his merits, a light, from Heaven was seen over his grave
every night; till the neighbouring people who saw it, perceiving that he
had been a holy man that was buried there, and inquiring who and whence
he was, carried away the body, and interred it in the church, in the
city of Boulogne, with the honour due to so great a person.
