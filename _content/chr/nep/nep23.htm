</FONT><FONT SIZE=5><P>T</FONT>HOUGH I am young, a little one,<BR>
If I can speak, and go alone,<BR>
Then I must learn to know the Lord,<BR>
And learn to read his holy word.<BR>
'Tis time to seek to God, and pray<BR>
For what I want for every day<BR>
I have a precious soul to save,<BR>
And I a mortal body have.<BR>
Though I am young, yet I may die,<BR>
And hasten to eternity.<BR>
There is a dreadful fiery hell,<BR>
Where wicked ones must always dwell.<BR>
There is a heaven, full of joy,<BR>
Where godly ones will always stay.<BR>
To one of these in my soul must fly,<BR>
As in a moment, when I die.<BR>
When God, who made me, calls me home,<BR>
I must not stay; I must be gone.<BR>
He gives me life, he gives me breath,<BR>
And he can save my soul from death,<BR>
By Jesus Christ, my only Lord,<BR>
Aecordingr to his holy word.<BR>
He clothes my back, and keeps me warm,<BR>
He saves my bones and flesh from harm;<BR>
He gives me bread, and milk, and meat,<BR>
And all I have that's good to eat.<BR>
When I am sick, he, if he please,<BR>
Can make me well, and give me ease.<BR>
He gives me sleep and quiet rest,<BR>
Whereby my body is refreshed.<A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A><BR>
The Lord is good and kind to me,<BR>
And very thankful I must be.<BR>
I must not sin, as others do,<BR>
Lest I lie down in sorrow too;<BR>
For God is angry every day<BR>
With wicked ones who go astray.<BR>
From sinful words I must refrain;<BR>
I must not take God's name in vain<BR>
I must not work, I must not play,<BR>
Upon God's holy Sabbath day.<BR>
And if my parents speak the word,<BR>
I must obey them in the Lord,<BR>
Nor steal, nor lie, nor waste my days<BR>
In idle tales and foolish plays.<BR>
I must obey my Lord's commands,<BR>
Do something with my little hands.<BR>
Remember my Creator now,<BR>
In youth, when time will it allow.<BR>
Young Samuel, that little child,<BR>
He served the Lord, lived undefiled:<BR>
Him in his service God employed,<BR>
While Eli's wicked children died.<BR>
When wicked children, mocking, said<BR>
To a good man, <I>Go up, bald head</I>,<BR>
God was displeased with them, and sent<BR>
Two bears, which them in pieces rent<BR>
I must not, like these children vile,<BR>
Displease my God, myself defile<BR>
Like young Abijah, I must see<BR>
That good things may be found in me.<BR>
Young King Josiah, that blessed youth,<BR>
He sought the Lord and loved the truth,<BR>
He like a king did act his part,<BR>
And followed God with all his heart <A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A><BR>
The little children, they did sing<BR>
Hosannas to their heavenly King.<BR>
That blessed child, young Timothy,<BR>
Did learn God's word most heedfully.<BR>
It seemed to be his recreation,<BR>
Which made him wise unto salvation,<BR>
By faith in Christ which he had gained,<BR>
By prayers and tears with faith unfeigned,<BR>
These good examples were for me;<BR>
Like these good children I must be.<BR>
Give me true faith in Christ my Lord,<BR>
Obedience to his holy word.<BR>
No word is in this world like thine;<BR>
There's none so pure, sweet, and divine.<BR>
From thence let me thy will behold,<BR>
And love, thy word above fine gold.<BR>
Mahe my heart in thy statutes sound,<BR>
And make my faith and love abound:<BR>
Lord, circumcise my heart to love thee,<BR>
And nothing in this world above thee.<BR>
Let me behold thy pleased face,<BR>
And make my soul to grow in grace,<BR>
And in the knowledge of my Lord<BR>
And Savior Christ, and of his word.</P></DIR>

<FONT SIZE=5><P>F</FONT>EAR thou the Lord, and prize him more<BR>
Than shining gold and richest ore<BR>
For when thy worldly treasure's past,<BR>
The love of God will ever last.</P>
