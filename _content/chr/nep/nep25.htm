</FONT><P ALIGN="CENTER">YOUTH.</P>
<FONT SIZE=5><P>T</FONT>HOSE days which God to me doth send,<BR>
In pleasure I'm resolved to spend;<BR>
Like as the birds, in lovely spring,<BR>
Sit chirping on the bonghs, and sing,--<A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A><BR>
Who, straining forth thns. warbling notes,<BR>
Do make sweet music in their throats,--<BR>
So I resolve, in this my prime,<BR>
In sports and plays to spend my time.<BR>
Sorrow and grief I'll put away;<BR>
Such things agree not with my day.<BR>
From clouds my morning shall be free,<BR>
And nought on earth shall trouble me.<BR>
I will embrace each sweet delight<BR>
This earth affords me, day and night;<BR>
Though parents grieve, and me correct,<BR>
Yet I their counsel will reject.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DEVIL.</P>
<P>The resolution which you take,<BR>
Sweet Youth, it doth me merry make.<BR>
If thou my counsel wilt embrace,<BR>
And shun the ways of truth and grace<BR>
And learn to lie, to curse, and swear.<BR>
And be as proud as any are,<BR>
And with thy brothers wilt fall out,<BR>
And sisters with vile language flout,<BR>
Yea, fight and scratch, and also bite,<BR>
Then I in thee will take delight.<BR>
If thou wilt but be ruled by me,<BR>
An artist thou shalt quickly be<BR>
In all my ways, which lovely are;<BR>
There's few with thee who shall compare.<BR>
Thy parents always disobey;<BR>
Don't mind at all what they do say;<BR>
And also proud and sullen be,<BR>
And thou shalt be a child for me.<BR>
When others read, be thou at play<BR>
Think not on God; don't mind to pray,<BR>
Nor be thou such a silly fool<BR>
To mind thy book, or go to school,<BR>
But play the truant; fear not. I<BR>
Will straightway help thee to a lie,<A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A><BR>
Which will excuse thee for the same,<BR>
From being whipped, and from all blame.<BR>
Come, bow to me; uphold my crown;<BR>
And I'll thee raise to high renown</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">YOUTH.</P>
<P>These notions I will cleave unto,<BR>
And let all other counsel go.<BR>
My heart against my parents now<BR>
Shall hardened be, and will not bow<BR>
I won't submit at all to them,<BR>
But all good counsel will contemn;<BR>
And what I list that do will I,<BR>
And stubborn be continually.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHRIST.</P>
<P>Wilt thou, O Youth, make such a choice<BR>
And thus obey the Devil's voice?<BR>
Cursed, sinful ways wilt thou embrace,<BR>
And hate the ways of truth and grace?<BR>
Wilt thou to me a rebel prove,<BR>
And from thy parents quite remove<BR>
Thy heart also? then shalt thou see<BR>
What will ere long become of thee.<BR>
Come, think on God, who did thee make,<BR>
And at his presence dread and quake<BR>
Remember him now in thy youth,<BR>
And let thy soul take hold on truth<BR>
The devil and his ways defy;<BR>
Believe him not; he doth but lie<BR>
His ways seem sweet, but, Youth, beware;<BR>
He for thy soul hath laid a snare.<BR>
His sweet will unto bitter turn;<BR>
If in those ways thou still wilt run,<BR>
He will thee into pieces tear,<BR>
Like lions which most hungry, are.<BR>
Grant me thy heart, thy folly leave,<BR>
And from this lion I'll thee save; <A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A><BR>
And thou shalt have sweet joy from me,<BR>
Which will last to eternity.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">YOUTH.</P>
<P>My heart shall cheer me in my youth<BR>
I'll have my frolics in good truth:<BR>
Whate'er seems lovely in mine eye,<BR>
Myself I cannot it deny.<BR>
In mine own ways I still will walk,<BR>
And take delight among young folk<BR>
Who spend their days in joy and mirth!<BR>
Nothing like that while I'm on earth!<BR>
Thy ways, O Christ, are not for me<BR>
They with my age do not agree:<BR>
If I unto thy laws should cleave,<BR>
No more good days then should I have.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHRIST.</P>
<P>Wouldst thou live long, and good days see<BR>
Refrain from all iniquity;<BR>
True good alone from me doth flow;<BR>
It can't be had in things below.<BR>
Are not my ways, O Youth, for thee<BR>
Then thou shalt never happy be;<BR>
Nor ever shall thy soul obtain<BR>
True good, whilst thou dost here remain</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">YOUTH.</P>
<P>To thee O Christ, I'll not adhere<BR>
What thou speakst of does not appear<BR>
Lovely to me: I cannot find<BR>
'Tis good to set or place my rnind<BR>
On ways whence many sorrows spring.<BR>
And to the flesh such crosses bring.<BR>
Don't trouble me; I must fulfil<BR>
My fleshly mind, and have my will</P>
<P><A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHRIST.</P>
<P>Unto thyself, then, I'll thee leave,<BR>
That Satan may thee wholly have;<BR>
Thy heart in sin shall hardened be,<BR>
And blinded in iniquity!<BR>
And then in wrath I'll cut thee down,<BR>
Like as the grass and flowers are mown<BR>
And, to thy woe, thou shalt espy<BR>
Childhood and youth are vanity:<BR>
For all such things I'll make thee know<BR>
To judgment thou shalt come also<BR>
In hell at last thy soul must burn,<BR>
When thou thy sinful race hast run.<BR>
Consider this; think on thy end,<BR>
Lest God do thee in pieces rend.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">YOUTH.</P>
<P>Amazed, Lord, I now begin;<BR>
O help me, and I'll leave my sin<BR>
I tremble and do greatly fear<BR>
To think upon what I do hear.<BR>
Lord, I religious now will be,<BR>
And I'll from Satan turn to thee.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DEVIL.</P>
<P>Nay, foolish Youth, don't change thy mind;<BR>
Unto such thoughts be not inclined.<BR>
Come, cheer thy heart, rouse up, be glad;<BR>
There is no hell; why art thou sad!<BR>
Eat, drink, be merry with thy friend;<BR>
For when thou diest, that's thy end.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">YOUTH.</P>
<P>Such thoughts as these I can't receive,<BR>
Because God's word I do believe,<BR>
None shall in this destroy my faith;<BR>
Nor do I mind what Satan saith.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DEVIL.</P>
<P>Although to thee herein I yield,<BR>
Yet I ere long shall win the field.<BR>
That thcre's a heaven I can't deny,<BR>
Yea, and a hell of misery;<BR>
That heaven is a lovely place<BR>
I can't deny,--'tis a clear case,--<BR>
And easy it is to come there;<BR>
Therefore take thou no further care<BR>
All human laws do thou observe,<BR>
And from old customs never swerve;<BR>
Do not oppose what great men say,<BR>
And thou shalt never go astray;<BR>
Thou mayst be drunk, and swear, and curse<BR>
And sinners like thee ne'er the worse;<BR>
At any time thou mayst repent,<BR>
'Twill serve when all thy days are spent.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHRIST.</P>
<P>Take heed, or else thou art undone.<BR>
These thoughts are from the wicked one<BR>
Narrow's the way that leads to life;<BR>
Who walk therein do meet with strife.<BR>
Few Shall be saved, as thou shalt know,<BR>
But many to destruction go.<BR>
If righteous ones scarce saved be,<BR>
What will at last become of thee?<BR>
Oh! don't neglect my precious call<BR>
Lest suddenly in hell thou fall:<BR>
Unless that thou converted be,<BR>
God's kingdom thou shalt never see.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">YOUTH.</P>
<P>Lord, I am now at a great stand;<BR>
If I should yield to thy command,<BR>
My comrades would me much deride<BR>
And never more with me abide; <A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A><BR>
Moreover, this I also know--<BR>
Thou canst at last great mercy show.<BR>
When I am old, and pleasure's gone,<BR>
Then what thou sayst, I'll think upon.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHRIST.</P>
<P>Nay, hold, vain youth; thy time is short<BR>
I'll have thy breath; I'll end thy sport!<BR>
Thou shalt not live till thou art old,<BR>
Since thou in sin art grown so bold;<BR>
I, in thy youth, grim Death will send.<BR>
And all thy sports put to an end</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">YOUTH.</P>
<P>I am too young, alas! to die<BR>
Let Death some old gray head espy.<BR>
O, spare me, and I will amend,<BR>
And with thy grace my soul befriend;<BR>
Or else I am undone: alas!<BR>
For I am in a woful case.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHRIST.</P>
<P>When I did call, thou wouldst not hear<BR>
But didst to me turn a deaf ear;<BR>
And now, in thy calamity.<BR>
I will not mind nor bear thy cry.<BR>
Thy day is past; begone from me,<BR>
Thou, who didst love iniquity<BR>
Above thy soul, or Savior dear,<BR>
Who on the cross great pain did bear.<BR>
My mercies thou didst much abuse<BR>
And all good counsel didst refuse: <BR>
Justice will therefore vengeance take,<BR>
And thee a sad example make.</P>
<P>YOUTH.</P>
<P>O, spare me, Lord; forbear thy hand<BR>
Don't cut me off, who trembling stand <A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A><BR>
Belging for mercy at thy door;<BR>
O, let me live but one year more!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHRIST.</P>
<P>If thou some longer time shouldst live<BR>
Thou wouldst again to folly cleave;<BR>
Therefore, to thee I will not give<BR>
One day on earth longer to live.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">DEATH.</P>
<P>Youth, I am come to take thy breath,<BR>
And carry thee to shades of death:<BR>
No pity to thee I can show,<BR>
Thou hast thy God offended so.<BR>
Thy soul and body I'll divide;<BR>
Thy body in the grave I'll hide,<BR>
And thy dear soul in hell must lie,<BR>
With devils, to eternity.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">------------</P>
<P>Thus end the days of wicked youth,<BR>
Who won't obey nor mind the truth,<BR>
Nor hearken to what preachers say,<BR>
But do their parents disobey.<BR>
They in their youth go down to hell,<BR>
Under eternal wrath to dwell,<BR>
And do not live out half their days,<BR>
For cleaving unto sinful ways.</P>
