        <CENTER>
          Who reigns above tha Sky!

        <CENTER>
          How shall a Child presume to sing 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          His dreadful Majesty! 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          &nbsp;How great his Power is none can tell, 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          Nor think how large his grace: 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          Nor men below, nor Saints that dwell, 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          On high before his Face. 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          &nbsp;Nor Angels that stand round the Lord, 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          Can search his secret will; 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          But they perform his heav'nly Word, 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          And sing his Praises still. 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          &nbsp;Then let me join this holy Train; 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          And my first Off'rings bring; 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          The eternal GOD will not disdain 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          To hear an Infant sing. 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          &nbsp;My Heart resolves, my Tongue obeys, 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          And Angels shall rejoice, 
        </CENTER>
        <CENTER>
          To hear their mighty Maker's Praise,

        Who on the cross great pains did bear,&nbsp; <BR>
        My mercy thou didst much abuse,&nbsp; <BR>
        And all good counsel didst refuse,&nbsp; <BR>
        Justice will therefore vengeance take,&nbsp; <BR>
        And thee a sad example make.&nbsp; 
        <P>&nbsp; 
        <H3> YOUTH.</H3>
        O Spare me, Lord, forbear thy hand,&nbsp; <BR>
        Don't cut me off who trembling stand,&nbsp; <BR>
        Begging for mercy at thy door,&nbsp; <BR>
        O let me have but one year more.&nbsp; 
        <P>&nbsp; 
        <H3> CHRIST.</H3>
        If thou some longer time should have,&nbsp; <BR>
        Thou wouldst again to folly cleave:&nbsp; <BR>
        Therefore to thee I will not give,&nbsp; <BR>
        One day on earth longer to live.&nbsp; 
        <P>&nbsp; 
        <H3> Death.</H3>
        Youth, I am come to fetch thy breath,&nbsp; <BR>
        And carry thee to th' shades of death,&nbsp; <BR>
        No pity on thee can I show,&nbsp; <BR>
        Thou has thy God offended so.&nbsp; <BR>
        Thy soul and body I'll divide,&nbsp;</TD>
    </TR>
    <TR> 
      <TD><A NAME="Page80"></A>Thy body in the grave 
        I'll hide,&nbsp; <BR>
        And thy dear soul in hell must lie,&nbsp; <BR>
        With Devils to eternity.&nbsp; 
        <P>&nbsp; 
        <H3> <I>The conclusion.</I></H3>
        Thus end the days of woful youth,&nbsp; <BR>
        Who won't obey nor mind the truth;&nbsp; <BR>
        Nor hearken to what preachers say,&nbsp; <BR>
        But do their parents disobey.&nbsp; <BR>
        They in their youth go down to hell,&nbsp; <BR>
        Under eternal wrath to dwell.&nbsp; <BR>
        Many don't live out half their days,&nbsp; <BR>
        For cleaving unto sinful ways.&nbsp;

        <FONT SIZE=+2>G</FONT>OOD children should remember daily, God their Creator, 
        Redeemer, and Sanctifier; to believe in, love and serve him; their parents 
        to obey them in the LORD; their bible and catechism; their baptism; the 
        LORD's day; the LORD's death and resurrection; their own death and resurrection; 
        and the day of judgment, when all that are not fit for heaven must be 
        sent to hell. And they Should pray to GOD in the name of CHRIST, for saving 
        grace.&nbsp;</TD>
