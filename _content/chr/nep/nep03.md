THE CREED.

I BELIEVE in God the Father, Almighty Maker of heaven and earth, and in
Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
crucified, dead, and buried. The third day he arose again from the dead,
and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God

the Father Almighty. From thence he shall come to judge both the quick
and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy catholic church, the
communion of the saints, the forgivness of sins, the resurrection of the
body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
