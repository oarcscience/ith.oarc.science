THE LORD'S PRAYER.

OUR Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily
bread; and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us
not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
