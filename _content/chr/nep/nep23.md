VERSES FOR LITTLE CHILDREN

THOUGH I am young, a little one,  
If I can speak, and go alone,  
Then I must learn to know the Lord,  
And learn to read his holy word.  
'Tis time to seek to God, and pray  
For what I want for every day  
I have a precious soul to save,  
And I a mortal body have.  
Though I am young, yet I may die,  
And hasten to eternity.  
There is a dreadful fiery hell,  
Where wicked ones must always dwell.  
There is a heaven, full of joy,  
Where godly ones will always stay.  
To one of these in my soul must fly,  
As in a moment, when I die.  
When God, who made me, calls me home,  
I must not stay; I must be gone.  
He gives me life, he gives me breath,  
And he can save my soul from death,  
By Jesus Christ, my only Lord,  
Aecordingr to his holy word.  
He clothes my back, and keeps me warm,  
He saves my bones and flesh from harm;  
He gives me bread, and milk, and meat,  
And all I have that's good to eat.  
When I am sick, he, if he please,  
Can make me well, and give me ease.  
He gives me sleep and quiet rest,  
Whereby my body is refreshed.<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>  
The Lord is good and kind to me,  
And very thankful I must be.  
I must not sin, as others do,  
Lest I lie down in sorrow too;  
For God is angry every day  
With wicked ones who go astray.  
From sinful words I must refrain;  
I must not take God's name in vain  
I must not work, I must not play,  
Upon God's holy Sabbath day.  
And if my parents speak the word,  
I must obey them in the Lord,  
Nor steal, nor lie, nor waste my days  
In idle tales and foolish plays.  
I must obey my Lord's commands,  
Do something with my little hands.  
Remember my Creator now,  
In youth, when time will it allow.  
Young Samuel, that little child,  
He served the Lord, lived undefiled:  
Him in his service God employed,  
While Eli's wicked children died.  
When wicked children, mocking, said  
To a good man, *Go up, bald head*,  
God was displeased with them, and sent  
Two bears, which them in pieces rent  
I must not, like these children vile,  
Displease my God, myself defile  
Like young Abijah, I must see  
That good things may be found in me.  
Young King Josiah, that blessed youth,  
He sought the Lord and loved the truth,  
He like a king did act his part,  
And followed God with all his heart <span id="page_32">p. 32</span>  
The little children, they did sing  
Hosannas to their heavenly King.  
That blessed child, young Timothy,  
Did learn God's word most heedfully.  
It seemed to be his recreation,  
Which made him wise unto salvation,  
By faith in Christ which he had gained,  
By prayers and tears with faith unfeigned,  
These good examples were for me;  
Like these good children I must be.  
Give me true faith in Christ my Lord,  
Obedience to his holy word.  
No word is in this world like thine;  
There's none so pure, sweet, and divine.  
From thence let me thy will behold,  
And love, thy word above fine gold.  
Mahe my heart in thy statutes sound,  
And make my faith and love abound:  
Lord, circumcise my heart to love thee,  
And nothing in this world above thee.  
Let me behold thy pleased face,  
And make my soul to grow in grace,  
And in the knowledge of my Lord  
And Savior Christ, and of his word.

--------------

FEAR thou the Lord, and prize him more  
Than shining gold and richest ore  
For when thy worldly treasure's past,  
The love of God will ever last.
