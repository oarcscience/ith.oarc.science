<P>
This was a standard reader in New England in the 18th and 19th centuries.
It was apparently used in both public and Sunday (religious) schools.
At that time children of all ages
<A HREF="nep01">studied in the same classroom</A>, so it
has portions oriented towards younger and older students.
</P>
<P>
Besides <A HREF="nep06">instruction in the alphabet</A>,
the <CITE>New England Primer</CITE>
also served to indoctrinate young
minds in the stern and <A HREF="nep12">somewhat morbid</A>
Protestantism of that time and place.
Depending on your viewpoint, it is either yet another
example of how religion has been excised from the public schools
in the United States,
or a quaint sample of what our forefathers considered acceptable 
as 'moral education'.</P>
<P>
The <CITE>New England Primer</CITE> also has examples of
religious intolerance, specifically anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic
statements, which reflect then-contemporary attitudes.
</P>
<P>This particular book went through a number of editions.
This version was scanned from an copy in the possession
of my family which was published in 1843.
An earlier version, dated 1777, is also available
<A HREF="1777/index">here</A>.
