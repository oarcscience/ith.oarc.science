<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">THE 'DE CIVITATE DEI' IN LATER DAYS</h2>
<p>THE medi&aelig;val unity was the grandest attempt in human history to base the
structure of institutions upon righteousness, political, social and economic, no
less than religious. When this unity broke up, a new world--as Luther said--came
into being. It might seem as though the ideals connected with the medi&aelig;val
projection of the <i>Civitas Dei </i>were gone beyond recall. That is true only
partially. The break up of the ancient order did destroy this idea for Europe as
a whole. Take such works as the 'Utopia' of Sir Thomas More and the 'Il
Principe' of Macchiavelli. We can see how men's dreams were changed no less than
the facts. The Renaissance appeared to have put an end to all such hopes as
those which animated S. Thomas.</p>
<p>Macchiavelli's remorseless study of the facts of the inter-state scramble in
Italy is more remarkable for what it leaves out than for what it puts in. The
conception of natural law has vanished. The passion of nationality furnishes the
one ideal. In the moving and pathetic eloquence of the last chapter he cries for
a saviour, who shall do for distressed Italy what other saviours have done for
their people.</p>
<p>'If, as I said, in order to show the valour of Moses it was necessary for the
people of Israel to be enslaved in Egypt; and, for the magnanimity of Cyrus to
be seen, it was needful for the Persians to be oppressed by the Medes; and, to
illustrate the excellence of Theseus, the Athenians had to be dispersed: so now,
for the virtue of an Italian spirit to be seen, it was needful that Italy should
be reduced to the state in which she now is, and to be more enslaved than were
the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians, more scattered than the
Athenians, without head, without order beaten, dispirited, lacerated, hunted,
and in fact enduring every kind of ruin.'</p>
<p>Nothing can be nobler than Macchiavelli's desire for a redeemer of his
people. But of justice, whether in the internal government or in the external
relations of a people, he took no thought. Everything is reason of state.</p>
<p>Savonarola's ideal for Florence, to be a godfearing city with a true
democracy, had been given a trial. It had failed. With this failure, so far as
the Italian States were concerned, there disappeared all efforts at ideal
politics, until in the nineteenth century Macchiavelli's ideals triumphed by
Macchiavelli's own methods. Italy became united under the headship of Victor
Emmanuel and the astute diplomacy of Cavour. There was a man after
Macchiavelli's heart. He had his reward.</p>
<p>In Europe as a whole the Reformation destroyed the last hopes of a united
Christendom. The 'Balance of Power' became the guiding-star of statesmen. From
the League of Cambrai to the Partition of Poland was a natural development. We
too have seen it even go further. Acton said ' Calvin preached, and Bellarmin
lectured, but Macchiavelli reigned.' Here, however, a faint shadow of the old
ideal can be discerned in the ideas and principles which underlay modern
International Law.</p>
<p>In regard to both these developments it is possible to trace the influence,
if not the direct ancestry of ideas, to S. Augustine.</p>
<p>It has been thought that the second definition of a commonwealth in the ' De
Civitate Dei,' that in which the ideas of justice and religion do not appear,
may have had something to do with the development of the non-moral doctrine of
the State. It is doubtful how far this can be proved. This much is clear.
Augustine emphasised the aim of the terrene State as being earthly peace and no
more. This limitation has much to do with the rapidly developing theory of the
secular State. That was developed largely by the Jesuits, in order the better to
exalt the Church, the <i>Respublica Christiana. </i>Jesuit writers and others on
that side developed frankly a doctrine of the civil State as being purely
secular and having no ends that were not material. It can have to do with higher
ideals only in so far as it is directed to these ends by the supreme religious
guide. That is the principle of Bellarmin developed frankly and without
disguise. This is different from the principles of writers like Augustinus
Triumphus at the end of the Middle Ages, or of Bozius in the sixteenth century.
These definitely make the whole world a single State, of which the Pope as 'King
of Kings and Lord of Lords' is head. Bellarmin's doctrine of the indirect power
of the Papacy allows to the civil State a being and purpose of its own. On one
side it is frankly secular. The State of the Jesuits, when once it threw off its
ecclesiastical tutelage, would be more, not less, indifferent in matters of
religion--more also than was the old pagan State.</p>
<p>The distinction on which all this argument depends unfortunately comes
through S. Augustine. We saw that he was not always thinking of politics. Yet it
remains true that the whole conception of the State as <i>Civitas terrena </i>is
precisely what enabled the Jesuits to set up their doctrine of the civil State.
Since also it virtually coincided with the doctrine of pure politics, which
emerged at the Renaissance, it helped to produce our general modern notions.</p>
<p>On the other hand the influence of Augustine on the growth of International
Law is certain. That he laid down principles which might prove fruitful, if they
were needed, cannot be denied. The conception of a world of equal States living
in harmony and exchanging mutual services we owe to his mind, expressed in the
passage about a world consisting of small States We cannot say that the founders
of International Law depended upon S. Augustine. In Albericus Gentilis, 'De Jure
Belli,' there are no citations from the 'De Civitate Dei.' In the great work of
Grotius, 'De Jure Belli et Pads,' Augustine is frequently cited. This need not
mean much. Here and there important arguments are based on these quotations. Yet
so many authorities are adduced that it is hard to attribute priority to any
single one. The avowed doctrine of Grotius is Natural Law. Certainly that is in
S. Augustine, but Grotius did not take it from him. Still the general
conceptions which are to be found in the ' De Civitate Dei,' of the mitigation
of warfare through Christianity, of the sense of a common bond between nations,
the insistence upon justice, the bitter condemnation of a policy of mere
conquest--all these were among the many influences that helped to keep alive
some flickering brands of Christendom, implying something better than the 'law
of the beasts.' I am not certain that we can say more. The great ideal of a
world ruled by justice had gone. If, however, the nations, now definitely
recognised as sovereign and independent, should ever come to concord, they might
point to the passage of which I have so often spoken, as laying down the ideal
of world-politics in a body of States independent but mutually concordant.</p>
<p>So much for Christendom and the great State. When we come to reduce the
scale, the story is different. In the narrower field of compact territorial
sovereignty, governments were not necessarily irresponsive to the same ideals
that we saw embodied in the Holy Roman Empire. Moreover, during the long period
of the wars of religion until at least 1609, when the Dutch won their long
truce, and in a less degree until 1648, when absolute differences of religion
were guaranteed at the Peace of Westphalia, the idea of some sort of Christendom
survived. The State, as conceived by the Renaissance, the embodiment of power
and nothing but power, did not triumph finally, except later on in Prussia. That
was prevented by the Reformation, with its emphasis on theocratic and scriptural
ideas of government.</p>
<p>In the first place, the concentrated territorialism of the new States in
Germany made the unity of religion with them a feasible aim--a Lutheran could
leave a Calvinist State and live elsewhere still under the same 'Kultur.' So
much so that one elector could say that 'his subjects' consciences belonged to
him.' What triumphed everywhere was Erastianism--the lay power in a Christian
State ruling over the clerical. Luther did not desire a State religiously
heterogeneous. He did not desire a State founded on power alone. Luther and
Melanchthon desired to transfer to civic and family life all the consecration of
aim associated heretofore with monastic devotion. Erastus himself declared that
he was considering the case of a State in which one religion and one only was
tolerated, and that the true one. The control of the inner life of the Church by
a Parliament, which might be composed of 'Jews, Turks, infidels and heretics,'
was the last thing that Erastus contemplated. What he desired was to take all
coercive authority out of the hands of the clergy, and transfer it to the civil
magistrate. Stubbs says of Henry VIII 'that he would be the Pope, the whole Pope
and something more than the Pope,' referring to the jurisdiction. The movement
was a layman's movement, not in itself anti-religious. Its ideal is 'the godly
prince.' Its State is a commonwealth in which Christ is King, no whit less than
was the medi&aelig;val theocracy. All through the period of the Reformation this
ideal expresses itself.</p>
<p>With this expression there grew a more explicit recognition of the
Commonwealth and the Church as two aspects of the same society. This doctrine
was not confined to men of any especial opinion. It is the doctrine of Luther
and Musculus and of John Knox but also of Whitgift and Laud and the more extreme
Gallican lawyers in France, but not of Bossuet. We in England have this doctrine
enshrined for ever by the serene and gracious intelligence of Hooker. Nothing
could be clearer than his statement:</p>
<p>'When we oppose the Church, therefore, and the Commonwealth in a Christian
society, we mean by the Commonwealth that society with relation unto all the
public affairs thereof, only the matter of true religion excepted; by the Church
the same society with only reference unto the matter of true religion, without
any other affairs besides; when that society which is both a Church and a
Commonwealth doth flourish in these things which belong to it as a Commonwealth,
we then say the Commonwealth doth flourish; when in the things which concern it
as a Church, the Church doth flourish; when in both, then the Church and the
Commonwealth flourish together,' (Hooker, <i>Ecclesiastical Polity, </i>viii. 15
; <i>Works, </i>iii. 420.)</p>
<p>The opposite doctrine of the two kingdoms, as found in Hooker's adversary,
Thomas Cartwright, is greeted by Whitgift with surprise as a strange monstrous
birth. This doctrine, that of Church and State as two distinct societies, was
developed by Huguenots in France, by Independents like Robert Browne in his
treatise 'Reformation without tarrying for any' (<i>any </i>meaning the civil
magistrate), but above all by the second generation of Presbyterians. It might
be alleged by the Presbyterians that their doctrine was more akin to S.
Augustine than that of the Middle Ages. No more than S. Augustine did the
Presbyterians leave the State free in the interests of religion, but demanded
that the Prince should use force to direct men for their good. The famous words
of</p>
<p>Andrew Melville to James I in 1606 are a classical expression of it.</p>
<p>It was, however, the earlier doctrine that long ruled-- the conception of
the State as in sort a Church--inside a compact unitary State. The argument for
unity which in the Middle Ages had been employed partly on behalf of the
Emperor, but more effectively on that of the Pope, could now be made the ground
for treating the civil power as 'over all persons and in all causes supreme.'
This principle of religious unity as a foundation of the Commonwealth and the
only possible source of justice, was proclaimed by people of widely different
opinions. In France we have the <i>une loi, un roi, une foi </i>of pamphleteers
like Louis d'Orl&eacute;ans. This cry produced the 'conversion' of Henri Quatre, and
ultimately the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, parallel with the assertion of
extreme royalism in the Gallican Articles of 1682 and the threat to break off
from Rome. On the other side we have Erastus proclaiming that there could be no
coercive authority in the spiritual power, hinting that if necessary the prince
could teach and administer the sacraments, developing into the doctrine of 'the
Lord's Anointed' as a <i>persona mixta, </i>partly lay, partly ecclesiastical. A
little later we see it expressed in the absolutism of Hobbes; and symbolised on
his famous frontispiece. On the largest scale we see Hooker applying it to a
nation-state. But it is not confined to that. Anabaptists are often treated as
mere anarchists. That is only one side of them. The constructive governing side
was shown in the attempt to secure a State inspired in every detail by Christian
principles. Knipperdolling, the King, as he was called, of M&uuml;nster, put this
into practice. It is adumbrated in the 'Restitution' of Rothmann, who argues
against the Chiliasts and in favour of a Kingdom of Christ on earth now, thus
recalling S. Augustine.</p>
<p>Calvin at Geneva and the Puritan polities illustrate the same principle. The
reign of the saints, so called, was but the counterpart, on the narrower scale,
of the doctrine of the rule of Christ in a truly just republic-- of that rule
which the Canonists and Ultramontanes gave to the Pope.</p>
<p>Let us take a literary expression of this. 'Nova Solyma,' which appeared in
1648, is an attempt to imagine the city of God upon earth, 'to build Jerusalem,'
as the name implies. It is a work of amazing interest both for its educational
and political ideals. Despite much that was irritating in his manner, Mr. Begley,
who published a translation in 1902, has done service in recalling this didactic
romance from limbo. Let me quote from an article in the <i>Church Quarterly </i>which
I wrote on the topic in the following year.</p>
<p>'Puritanism, like nearly all ascetic ideals, had in it a strong Manichean
bias. We know it chiefly by its enmities. It was active for destruction. It
destroyed the monarchy, the aristocracy, and finally the representative system.
It abolished the drama, it proscribed the Liturgy, it persecuted the bishops, it
knocked down statues, overturned altars and shattered windows. It first
abolished tyranny and then destroyed liberty and finally completed its career of
devastation by giving the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce </i>to itself. Few movements have
been to all appearances more uniform in their destructive tendencies than was
English political Puritanism. But it is no more right to judge Puritanism by its
antipathies than it is Christianity. . . . It is the constructive side of
Puritanism that &quot;Nova Solyma&quot; expresses. . . .</p>
<p>'Puritanism at its best was constructive. Starting from the conception, made
familiar to us all by Mr. James, of the twice-born soul, it desired to see a new
&quot;city of God&quot; upon earth, in which, with whatever latitude for
political and natural differences, the life of the Christian should be properly
trained and guarded by a State directed by religious principles and acting
solely from the highest aims. . . .</p>
<p>'This ideal of a Christian State in accordance with Puritan principles is the
whole purpose of &quot;Nova Solyma.&quot; . . . It is the XVIIth Century <i>Civitas
Dei, </i>as indeed its name implies. . . . Though Puritanism as a
politico-religious party was not long in the ascendant, many of its governing
ideas found their way into the more serious-minded of all classes, and have had
a profound effect upon the national character. These or some of them will be
found in &quot;Nova Solyma,&quot; where we can learn that the Puritan was no
Little Englander, no mere ascetic, no opponent of war, or hunting, or reading as
such; but that his ideal was a State governed on principles of righteousness,
training its members--body, mind, and spirit--in all the faculties and
sentiments which may minister to the efficiency and energy appropriate to the
conduct of a Christian member of an orderly and self-controlling society.
Religion since the Reformation, said Sir A. F. Hort, has been departmental, and
given up the aim of controlling the whole of human life in the way that
medi&aelig;val Catholicism attempted. This is unfortunately to a certain extent true,
but was not so always or in aim ; and such books as &quot;Nova Solyma&quot; are
the proof of a broader ideal.' (<i>C.Q.R.</i>, lvii. No. 113, Oct. 1903,
125-130.)</p>
<p>That work is English. Take one which is not. Johann Valentin Andreae in 'Christianopolis'
affords a similar illustration.[<a name="text01" href="#foot01">1</a>] Here,
too, the main interest of the whole is in its ideals of education. But it is on
a smaller scale and in every way inferior to ' Nova Solyma.' Both of them show
how deeply men's imaginations were affected by the doctrine of an ideal
Christian Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Let us now take instances from men of opposite Political sympathies. The
doctrine of the 'Divine Right of Kings,' on its religious as distinct from its
legal and historical side, is an expression of the notion that the civil State
ought to be a commonwealth of Christians, the <i>Civitas Dei. </i>It is this
half-romantic, half-sacramental doctrine which consecrated to many the cause of
the Stuarts. This religious side of the doctrine was as a rule stronger in
England than in France.</p>
<p>Yet Bossuet's 'Politique Tir&eacute;e de l'Ecriture Sainte' is a good illustration
of it. Bossuet prided himself on this dull work which looked towards the past,
although it must be admitted that Bossuet never merged the Church in the State,
but always regarded them as two societies. It is well to take this work as an
illustration. With the beginning of the eighteenth century the end had come, so
far as this country was concerned. The Nonjuring schism had considerable
importance It developed strongly in the minds of men like William Law (in his
letters to Hoadly) the doctrine of the Church, as a society in itself distinct
from the State, though it might be composed of the same persons. Each body was,
in the later phrase of Leo XIII, a <i>societas genere et jure perfecta. </i>The
Bangorian controversy which was aroused by Hoadly's sermon 'The Kingdom of
Christ,' showed the same notion in the religious sphere. Hoadly was dominated by
the ancient notion which made the Church co-extensive with the nation; and
therefore desired the comprehension within it of anybody and everybody. Sherlock
and his other opponents asserted the distinctness and historic independence of
the Church, and the incompetence of the civil power to control it. This tendency
had been increased by other causes. The Toleration Act and the Union with
Scotland destroyed the notion of a uniform religious State. True it left some
basis, for the Toleration Act stopped short of Unitarianism or the Papacy, and
the Scots refused to tolerate episcopacy. But now the Kingdom, united as never
before, was not even professedly uniform in religion. It boasted two different
established churches. Naturally, this led to a resuscitation, even among
establishment Divines, of the doctrine of the two Societies.</p>
<p>Warburton's 'Alliance between Church and State' is a better book than many
people think. It lays down that the two bodies are entirely distinct in nature,
though they may be composed of the same individuals. But the State establishes a
Church from a utilitarian, not from a religious motive. It is not the business
of the State to seek the truth, but merely to take the religion of the majority
of its members and establish that. As the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
proceeded, the old Augustinian doctrine of a Christian Church-State prevailing
in the Middle Ages, and through the Reformation, gradually disappeared.
Toleration gave way to complete civil rights for Dissenters, Roman Catholics,
Jews, and finally Atheists. It has been recently decided in the Courts that a
bequest to a Free Thinking Association was legal. Religious heterogeneity is
recognised as a principle of the modern State. In Mr. Gladstone's early book, '
The State in its Relations with the Church,' we find a last echo of the old
view. But he does not contemplate, like Hooker, a single society. Rather, he
treats the Church as the conscience of the State, and deprecates on that ground
the admission of the Jews to full political rights.</p>
<p>The notion of a theocracy has more and more receded from discussions on
general politics. The notion of the principles of Christian ethics--<i>i.e. </i>the
golden rule, which is held by many non-Christians on different grounds --as the
governing doctrine of political and social justice, has tended to increase in
importance. Not merely Christian socialism, but many more general doctrines of
humanity, are content to argue that (in this sense) the world is or ought to be
Christian, and its legislation ought to be framed according to the
Jewish-Christian rule of fraternity. This tendency has been enhanced by the war.
Many who before regarded Christianity as an effete system of impossible dogmas
awakened to find that the real difference between the belligerents was nothing
less than the prevalence of certain ethical ideals, of which the most eminent if
not the only expression was the Christian system. Reconstruction,</p>
<p>it is alleged, in order to be stable, must follow these lines--whether
applied to Europe as a whole in the relations between States, or to the domestic
economy of peoples, or to the relations of classes. As the doctrine of absolute
state-sovereignty is criticised, so also is the companion doctrine of absolute
rights in private property. Neither of these criticisms is new, even in modern
times. Both have been rendered more acute by the war, <i>i.e. </i>the ideal of a
State is more and more seen to be dependent on justice.</p>
<p>Only, as S. Augustine failed to see, justice in politics and in social
economy has reference only to those ideals of <i>cuique suum tribuere </i>and
the Golden Rule, which are not necessarily in fact bound up with religion. Men
can unite in those, who yet differ <i>in toto </i>on the theological foundation.
In this sense indeed it may be natural to look forward to a Christian State; but
certainly it is neither natural nor wise to do so in the sense of a State which
promulgates the Christian religion and none other. Consequently, while
legislation or custom may well be pressed on the ground of its accordance with
Christian principles, so far as they are confined to the social doctrine, it is
impolitic and even wrong to condemn or promote legislation on the ground that it
conflicts with the law of the Christian Church. That is to attempt to make what
is true only of one society govern the whole.</p>
<p>To sum up, with the Renaissance the secular or pagan State tended to become
the ideal. This effect was counteracted by the Reformation. Yet that destroyed
the ancient unity of Western Christendom and made impossible the ideal of the
Holy Roman Empire, of a single Catholic Commonwealth of princes and lords and
peoples, a unity of all culture. Vestiges of this lingered on and helped towards
the beginning of modern International Law. On the smaller scale of the separate
State, the effect of the Reformation was different. It tightened instead of
loosening all those ties that made for a concentrated unitary State. So much so,
that it is even now but slowly and with infinite reluctance that political
problems can be discussed on any other basis. For the more part within that
State it shifted the balance of power from the clergy to the laity, the Church
to the State, the Pope to the King. If we recognise that change, we can say that
the ideal of a uniform Christian commonwealth was as real to Hooker as it was to
Alfred the Great. This was the aim of the great national States like England and
France, of the smaller territorial sovereignties in Germany, with their maxim <i>cujus
regio ejus religio, </i>and even of bodies like the Anabaptists and Pilgrim
Fathers, as soon as they obtained rule. We see this expressed on the grand scale
by Hooker and Whitgift, on the smaller scale by Rothmann and 'Nova Solyma.' In
some of the arguments adduced in favour of established churches, and in certain
vague appeals to Christian principles, it can be discerned in our own days, and
can be traced right back to S. Augustine. On the whole, however, religious
heterogeneity is recognised as a fundamental part of the modern State, but in
regard to certain fundamental ethical principles of neighbourliness, mutual love
and so forth, Christian morals (as apart from any kind of theology) are
increasingly recognised as integral to a just and even to a stable organisation
of life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the development of the secular, this-worldly theory of the
State, whether by Jesuits or Presbyterians in their own interest, owes much to
the other and more commonly neglected side of S. Augustine--that in which he
openly discarded the principles of religion in the idea of a commonwealth. The
sharp distinction between secular and sacred, holy and profane, which ruled
historical writing until recently, though not introduced, was enormously
strengthened by S. Augustine.</p>
<p>The problem which S. Augustine discussed in this book is fundamental, nor has
it ever been finally resolved. It is a conflict not primarily between two
polities. To make it that, is to externalise it and to make it relatively
superficial, deep down in history though even that goes. Rather the conflict is
one between two religions<i>-- </i>Christianity and Paganism. That is S.
Augustine's primary and predominating thought. It never leaves him. These two
religions are conceived as the binding force of two societies, the expression of
two opposing passions: <i>Fecerunt itaque civitates duas amores duo-- </i>the
passion for God and the passion for self. That is the direction alike of angelic
and human wills, which makes the whole time-process since the fall of Lucifer a
drama of eternal tragedy, and conditions the Redemption. If we seek to
understand S. Augustine mainly by the outcome to which his system led in
history, we shall do wrong. Rather we must seek to understand that by the deeper
antagonism--between the other-worldly and the this-worldly reference of all
institutions. This we shall realise better by a more intimate personal knowledge
of the most intimate and personal of all divines until John Henry Newman. In
Augustine there were struggling two men, like Esau and Jacob in the womb of
Rebecca. There was Augustine of Thagaste, of Madaura, of Carthage, of Rome, of
Milan, the brilliant boy, the splendid and expansive youthful leader, 'skilled
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,' possessed of the antique culture,
rhetorical, dialectic, Roman-- the man of the world, the developed humanist
with enough tincture of Platonism to gild the humanism; and there is the
Augustine of the 'Confessions,' of the 'Sermons,' of the 'De Civitate,' the
monk, the ascetic, the other-worldly preacher, the biblical expositor, the
mortified priest. These two beings struggle for ever within him, the natural man
filled with the sense of beauty and the joy of living, expansive, passionate,
artful--and the supernatural Christian fleeing from the world, shunning it,
burning what he adored, and adoring what he burnt, celibate and (at times)
almost anti-social.</p>
<p>This book itself is too great to be consistent. We can see in it traces of
this ceaseless conflict. The otherworldly aim is predominant, the annihilation
of all earthly values in comparison with the <i>summum bonum.</p>
</i>
<p>But evidences, we have noted, remain of the humane, social, cultured ideal.
The conflict is eternal in human life. No change of religion will put a term to
it. Not even as some think, as I suppose Augustine thought, the abolition of all
eternal values. On the one hand is the world, the present, the course of life,
the immediate 'nice things'; and on the other the Eternal, the far-off, the
spiritual city, the altar of sacrifice, the chalice of suffering--each calls
us, each finds response in our nature. How can this problem be resolved? One way
is by complete world-flight, the extreme of asceticism, <i>i.e. </i>asceticism
not as discipline but as self-annihilation, or, as seen in the sphere of
institutions, in the utter subjection of the city of this world to the rule of
those who speak in the name of the Eternal. On the other is the pagan solution,
frankly materialistic, developing on its better side a grand picture of human
society, and a high development of all human arts, but ruling out as irrelevant
all interests that look beyond. Neither by itself can satisfy.</p>
<p>The real change in S. Augustine took place when he was converted to Platonism
by reading Cicero's 'Hortensius' and not in the later well-known scene in the
garden at Milan. From that first moment related in the 'Confessions' he had the
nostalgia of the infinite, and all earthly goods were annihilated to his
restless spirit. The charge brought by Nietzsche against Plato that he did the
real damage, preparatory to Christianity, by setting up the doctrine of another
world is true.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is this which makes Augustine's apologetic more impressive on the
general theistic, than it is on its distinctively Christian, side.</p>
<p>Yet that fact suggests the solution. Plato, and still more the
Neo-Platonists, showed that a mere humanistic culture is bankrupt at the last,
for man's heart is restless until he find God. Even humanism as an ideal cannot
be carried out without an infusion of the otherworldly principle--present
pleasure must be given up for future bliss even by an Alexander.</p>
<p>Augustine calls attention to this. The Romans, he said, were moved by earthly
motives of ambition, no more. To that end they were prodigal of sacrifice.
Christians for their end, which is so much higher, would do well if they were to
learn the devotion to the heavenly <i>patria </i>which the Romans gave to an
earthly one. In other words, the Roman State, the earthly aim, could not be
maintained except by sacrifice. True, the sacrifice is for an end of this world
alone. Yet it is equally sacrifice of the immediate for a far-off end, for an
individual and even for a community like Saguntum it means the surrender of life
itself for the good of the whole. What makes this possible?</p>
<p>Even earthly ambitions apart from the State, even sheer individualism, can
make no progress without sacrifice and what Christians call the Cross. Any
successful merchant knows that. Even the hardest voluptuary must postpone
immediate goods--in the Christian phrase, must die to live--and take risks, or
he will not fulfil the demands of his passions.</p>
<p>Thus then the edifce of humane culture cannot but rest its foundations on the
principle of the Cross, and also upon social and communal interdependence. ' Man
cannot live for himself alone.' Yet this principle has in many cases no meaning
and no appeal to the individual, if there be no world beyond.</p>
<p>Take the other side. Sheer world-flight is not possible. The extremest
ascetic--S. Simon on his pillar--must be fed. In the 'De Opere Monachorum S.
Augustine points this out.[<a name="text02" href="#foot02">2</a>] It is all very
well, he says, for people to say that a man ought to be entirely occupied with
the things of God, and therefore need do no labour. This cannot be. The dinner
must be cooked. Some manual work is a necessity in any self-sufficing society.
Therefore it cannot be contrary to true monastic life to do some secular work.</p>
<p>Besides, whether for the selfish end which we considered above, or for the
religious, sheer individualism would be the final abutment of either,
world-flight or world-acceptance, taken by itself. Sheer individualism is
literally unthinkable. A selfish man of culture needs the help of society at
every turn. A world-renouncing monk cannot do without security. Social and
communal activities are of the essence of human life, for no one can dispense
with them. If they are, then sacrifice of what we want, even, on occasion, of
life itself, becomes a necessity at times, a fact of which to-day we have lurid
evidence. Nor in the long run can such sacrifice be justified to the individual
apart from an other-worldly aim. The goods of human sacrifice are real goods.
But just as the individual is driven to the larger life of the community by the
natural fact of the family, so human society and all human culture is possible
only by the ultimate recognition of the eternal goal. Otherwise there will come
the decadence, such as overcame Greece and Rome and the Renaissance. That is the
lesson of the 'De Civitate Dei.' Our ideals of beauty must be rooted in the hope
