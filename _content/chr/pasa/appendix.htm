<h2 ALIGN="CENTER">APPENDIX</h2>
<p>THE following passages from Vives may interest the reader: (II, 7.) 'Thus
farre Lucian. We have rehearsed it in the words of Thomas Moore, whom to praise
negligently, or as if one were otherwise imployed, were grossnes. His due
commendations are sufficient to exceed great volumes. For what is he that can
worthily lim forth his sharpness of wit, his depth of judgement, his excellence
and variety of learning, his eloquence of phrase, his plausibility and integrity
of manners, his judicious foresight, his exact execution, his gentle modesty and
uprightness and his unmoved loyalty? Unlesse in one word he will say that they
are all perfect, intirely absolute, and exact in all their full proportions?
Unlesse he will call them (as they are indeed) the patterns and lusters, each of
his kind? I speake much, and many that have not known Moore will wonder at me,
but such as have, will know I speake but truth: so will such as shall either
reade his workes or but heare or looke upon his actions: but another time shall
be more fit to spred our sailes in this man's praises as in a spacious ocean,
wherein we will take this full and prosperous wind and write both much in
substance and much in value of his worthy honours, and that unto favourable
readers.'</p>
<p>(VIII, 4.) ' It is a great question in our schooles whether Logic be
speculative or practike. A fond question truly I thinke, and fellow with most of
our philosophicall theames of these times, where the dreams of practice and
speculation do nought but dull young apprehensions. . . . But these Schoolemen
neyther know how to speculate in nature nor action, nor how the life's actions
are to be ordered.'</p>
<p>(XI, 10.) ' Words, I thinke, adde little to religion, yet must we have a care
to keep the old path and received doctrine of the Church; for, divinity being so
farre above our reach, how can wee give it the proper explanation?</p>
<p>All words are man's inventions for humane uses, and no man may refuse the old
approved words to bring in new of his own invention; for whenas proprieties are
not to bee found out by man's wit, those are the fittest to declare things by,
that ancient use hath left us, and they that have recorded most part of our
religion. This I say for that a sort of smattering rash fellowes impiously
presume to cast the old formes of speech at their heeles, and to set up their
owne masterships, being grossly ignorant both in the matters, and their bare
formes, and will have it lawful for them at their fond likings to frame or
fashion the phrases of the Fathers in matter of religion into what forme they
list, like a nose of waxe.'</p>
<p>(XVIII, 18.) 'To create is to make something of nothing ; this God onely can
do; as all the Divines affirme: but then they dispute whether hee can
communicate this power unto a creature. Saint Thomas hath much concerning this;
and Scotus seekes to weaken his arguments to confirme his owne; and Occam is
against both, and Petrus de Aliaco against him: thus each one screweth the
celestiall power into what forme he please. How can manners be amended, how can
truth be taught, how can contentions be appeased as long as there is this
confused obstinate jangling, and this haling too and fro in matter of Divinity,
according as each man stands affected.'</p>
<p>(XIX, 21.) '<i>For we may not imagine man's, unjust decrees to be lawes; all
men defining law to arise out of the fountaine of justice</i>.'<i> </i>(Cicero, <i>De
Leg. </i>1.)</p>
<i>
<p>Vives: '</i>It was not the people's command (saith he) nor Prince's decrees
nor Judge's sentences, but the very rule of nature that gave original unto law.
And again . . . Thus Tully out of Plato, and thus the Stoikes held against
Epicurus, who held that nature accounted nothing just, but feare did. Seneca, <i>Epist.
</i>16. This holy law that lyeth recorded in every man's conscience, the
civilians call right and reason. . . . So that Ulpian defineth law to be <i>ars
aequi el boni</i>;<i> </i>an art of right and reason, making him only a lawyer
that can skill of this right and reason: and such that, as Tully said of
Sulpitius, referre all unto equity, and had rather end controversies than
procure them, that peace might generally be kept amongst men, and each be at
peace with himselfe, which is the chiefe joy of nature.'</p>
