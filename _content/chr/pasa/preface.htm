Neville Figgis was allowed to carry through. He prepared them for the press,
leaving them in the form of lectures and preserving here and there the impress
which the anxiety of war-crisis made upon them. In that form, therefore, they
are published now. In place of the final revision which his failing health
prevented him from making, another hand has tried unskilfully to supply what he
would have done with skill, in order to carry out his wishes and make his last
complete piece of work accessible to a wider public than those who heard the
lectures delivered.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p>
