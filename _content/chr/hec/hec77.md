### <span style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">S. Stephen the Sabaite.</span>

A.D. 725 . . . A D 799.

S. Stephen, called the Sabaïte, from the monastery of S. Sabas, was the
nephew of S. John Damascene, who placed him in that house. He was then
ten years of age: he passed fifty-nine years in that retreat; and was
the earliest of the hymnographers who lived to see the final restoration
of Icons. He has left but few poetical compositions. The two best are
those on the Martyrs of the monastery of S. Sabas—(March 10th)—on which
a monk of that house would be likely to write *con amore;* and on the
Circumcision. His style seems formed on that of

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> S. Cosmas, rather
than on that of his own uncle. He is not deficient in elegance and
richness of typology, but exhibits something of sameness, and is
occasionally guilty of very hard metaphors, as when he speaks of the
circumcision of the tempest of our souls." He is commemorated on the
13th of July.
