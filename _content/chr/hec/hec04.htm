<p>It is of course a matter of deep thankfulness to me that the Eastern Church should now be more and more widely brought before ordinary congregations by means of some of the following versions. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God</span> grant that this may be one little help towards the great work of Re-union.</p>  
<p>I have been more than once asked to what tunes any of the hymns contained in this little book may be sung. The following is a list of all the settings with which I am acquainted:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small>"Peace! It is I!" by the Rev. T. Helmore, M.A. Second Edition. Novello. 1863.</p>  
<p>"The Day of Resurrection:" by the Rev. T. Helmore, M.A. Novello. 1863.</p>  
<p>"The Day is past and over:" by the Rev. T. Helmore, M.A. Second Edition. Novello. 1865.</small></p>  
<p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></A></p>  
<p><small>"The Day is past and over:" by Arthur Henry Brown Organist of Brentwood. Second Edition. Masters.</p>  
<p>"Fierce was the wild billow:" by Edith Kerr. Novello.</p>  
<p>Fortitude: a Sacred Song. [<i>i.e.</i>, "Christian, dost thou see them?"] Music by M. E. H. S. Novello.</p>  
<p>Hymns of the Holy Eastern Church; set to music for four voices by Edmund Sedding. London, Masters. [This contains five.]</p>  
<p>Hymns of the Eastern Church. In competent score for four voices. Second Edition. London: Novello. Leicester: Crossley and Clarke. [This contains six. As it has no distinguishing title, it is referred to in the following page as H.E.C.]</small></p>  
<p>In the Church Hymnal of the Rev. J. F. Young, which having appeared in Philadelphia is reprinting in London, eleven of these hymns occur; the Greek being given as well as the English.</p>  
<p>Each of the above melodies will be found noticed at the end of the Hymn which has been set to it.</p>  
<p>And so once more I commit this attempt to</p>  
<p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></A></p>  
<p>further the cause of English Hymnology to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God's</span> blessing: and I cannot do it better than in the quaint old words of a forgotten poet:&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"I long have long&#8217;d to do some little good,<br> &nbsp;(According to the best I understood,)<br> &nbsp;By Thy good grace assisting, which I do<br> &nbsp;Most humbly beg for: O adjoin it to<br> &nbsp;My longing ardent soul; and have respect<br> &nbsp;To this my weak endeavour, and accept<br> &nbsp;(In Thy great mercy) both of it and me,<br> &nbsp;Ev&#8217;n as we dedicate ourselves to Thee."</small></div></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sackville College</span>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><i>April</i>, 1866</small></p>
