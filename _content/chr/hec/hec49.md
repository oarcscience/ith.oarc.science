### STICHERA AT THE FIRST VESPERS OF CHEESE-SUNDAY.

### (Quinquagesima.)

#### ADAM'S COMPLAINT.

by S. Theophanes

The reader can hardly fail to be struck with the beautiful idea in the
third stanza, where the foliage of Paradise is asked to make
intercession for Adam's recall. The last stanza, Milton, as an universal
scholar, doubtless had in his eye, in Eve's lamentation.

"The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my Maker, forming me of clay,  
By His own Breath, the breath of life convey’d  
O’er all the bright new world He gave me sway,  
A little lower than the Angels made.  
But Satan, using for his guile  
The crafty serpent’s cruel wile,  
Deceiv’d me by the Tree; <span id="page_165">p. 165</span>  
And severed me from <span class="smallcaps">God</span> and grace,  
And wrought me death, and all my race,  
As long as time shall be.  
O Lover of the sons of men!  
Forgive, and call me back again!

"In that same hour I lost the glorious stole  
Of innocence, that <span class="smallcaps">God's</span> own Hands had
made;  
And now, the tempter poisoning all my soul,  
sit, in fig leaves and in skins arrayed:  
I sit condemn’d, distress’d, forsaken;  
Must till the ground whence I was taken  
By labour's daily sweat.  
But Thou, That shalt hereafter come,  
The Offspring of a Virgin-womb,  
Have pity on me yet!  
O turn on me those gracious eyes,  
And call me back to Paradise!

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

"O glorious Paradise! O lovely clime!  
O God-built mansion! Joy of every Saint!  
Happy remembrance to all coming time!  
Whisper, with all thy leaves, in cadence faint,  
One prayer to Him Who made them all,  
One prayer for Adam in his fall!—  
That He, Who formed thy gates of yore,  
Would bid those gates unfold once more  
That I had closed by sin:  
And let me taste that holy Tree  
That giveth immortality  
To them that dwell therein:  
Or have I fallen so far from grace  
That mercy hath for me no place?"

Adam sat right against the Eastern gate,  
By many a storm of sad remembrance tost  
O me! so ruined by the serpent's hate!  
O me! so glorious once, and now so lost! <span id="page_167">p.
167</span>  
So mad that bitter lot to choose!  
Beguil'd of all I had to lose!  
Must I then, gladness of my eyes,—  
Must I then leave thee, Paradise,  
And as an exile go?  
And must I never cease to grieve  
How once my <span class="smallcaps">God</span>, at cool of eve,  
Came down to walk below?  
O Merciful! on Thee I call:  
O Pitiful! forgive my fall!"
