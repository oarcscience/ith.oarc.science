Canon for Apocreos

### ODE IV.

by Theodore of the Studium

ἐφέστηκεν ἡ ἡμέρα.

The Day is near, the Judgment is at hand,  
Awake, my soul, awake, and ready stand!  
Where chiefs shall go with them that filled the throne,  
Where rich and poor the same tribunal own;

        And every thought and deed  
        Shall find its righteous meed.

There with the sheep the shepherd of the fold  
Shall stand together; there the young and old;  
Master and slave one doom shall undergo;  
Widow and maiden one tribunal know.

        Oh woe, oh woe, to them  
        Whom lawless lives condemn!

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

That Judgment-seat, impartial in decree,  
Accepts no bribe, admits no subtilty:  
No orator persuasion may exert,  
No perjured witness wrong to right convert:

        But all things, hid in night,  
        Shall then be dragged to light.

Let me not enter in the land of woe,  
Let me not realms of outer darkness know!  
Nor from the wedding-feast reject Thou me,  
For my soiled vest of immortality;

        Bound hand and foot, and cast  
        In anguish that shall last!

When Thou, the nations ranged on either side,  
The righteous from the sinners shalt divide,  
Then give me to be found amongst Thy sheep,  
Then from the goats Thy trembling servant keep:

        That I may hear the voice  
        That bids Thy Saints rejoice!

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

When righteous inquisition shall be made,  
And the books opened, and the thrones arrayed,  
My soul, what plea to shield thee canst thou know,  
Who hast no fruit of righteousness to show,

        No holy deeds to bring  
        To <span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and King?

I hear the rich man's wail and bitter cry,  
Out of the torments of eternity;  
I know, beholding that devouring flame,  
My guilt and condemnation are the same;

        And spare me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, I say,  
        In the great Judgment Day!

The <span class="smallcaps">Word</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Spirit</span>, with the <span
class="smallcaps">Father</span> <span class="smallcaps">One</span>,  
One Light and emanation of One Sun,  
The <span class="smallcaps">Word</span> by generation, we adore,  
The <span class="smallcaps">Spirit</span> by procession, evermore;

        And with creation raise  
        The thankful hymn of praise.
