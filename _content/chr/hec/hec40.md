Canon for Christmas Day

### ODE V.

by S. Cosmas

Θεὸς ὢν εἰρήνης.

Father of Peace, and <span class="smallcaps">God</span> of
Consolation!  
  The Angel of the Counsel dost Thou send  
To herald peace, to manifest Salvation,  
  Thy Light to pour, Thy knowledge to extend;  
Whence, with the morning's earliest rays,  
Lover of men! Thy Name we praise.

’Midst Cæsar's subjects Thou, at his decreeing,  
  Obey’dst and was enrolled: our mortal race,  
To sin and Satan slave, from bondage freeing,  
  Our poverty in all points didst embrace:  
And by that Union didst combine  
The earthly with the All-Divine.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

Lo! Mary, as the world's long day was waning,  
  Incarnate Deity conceived and bore;  
Virgin in birth, and after birth, remaining;  
  And man to <span class="smallcaps">God</span> is reconciled once
more  
Wherefore in faith her name we bless,  
And Mother of our <span class="smallcaps">God</span> confess.
