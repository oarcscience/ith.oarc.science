Canon for Easter Day

### ODE V.

by S. John Damascene.

ὀρθρίσωμεν ὄρθρου βαθέος.

Let us rise in early morning,  
  And, instead of ointments, bring  
Hymns of praises to our Master,  
  And His Resurrection sing:  
We shall see the Sun of Justice  
  Risen with healing on His wing.

Thy unbounded loving-kindness,  
  They that groaned in Hades’ chain,  
Prisoners, from afar beholding,  
  Hasten to the light again  
And to that eternal Pascha  
  Wove the dance and raised the strain.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

Go ye forth, His Saints, to meet Him!  
  Go with lamps in every hand!  
From the sepulchre He riseth:  
  Ready for the Bridegroom stand:  
And the Pascha of salvation  
  Hail, with His triumphant band.
