### EVENING HYMN.

by S. Anatolius.

τὴν ἡμέραν διελθών.

This little hymn, which, I believe, is not used in the public service of
the Church, is a great favourite in the Greek Isles. Its peculiar style
and evident antiquity may well lead to the belief that it is the work of
our present author. It is, to the scattered hamlets of Chios and
Mitylene, what Bishop Ken's Evening Hymn is to the villages of our own
land; and its melody singularly plaintive and soothing.

The day is past and over;  
  All thanks, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, to Thee!  
I pray Thee, that offenceless  
  The hours of dark may be.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

O <span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>! keep me in Thy sight,  
  And save me through the coming night!

The joys of day are over:  
  I lift my heart to Thee;  
And call on Thee, that sinless  
  The hours of sin may be.  
O <span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>! make their darkness light,  
  And save me through the coming night!

The toils of day are over:  
  I raise the hymn to Thee;  
And ask that free from peril  
  The hours of fear may be.  
O <span class="smallcaps">Jesu</span>! keep me in Thy sight,  
  And guard me through the coming night!

Lighten mine eyes, O <span class="smallcaps">Saviour</span>,  
  Or sleep in death shall I;  
And he, my wakeful tempter,  
  Triumphantly shall cry: <span id="page_61">p. 61</span>  
"He could not make their darkness light,  
 Nor guard them through the hours of night!"

Be Thou my soul's preserver,  
  O <span class="smallcaps">God</span>! for Thou dost know  
How many are the perils  
  Through which I have to go:  
Lover of men! O hear my call,  
  And guard and save me from them all!
