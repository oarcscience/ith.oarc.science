<p>The first poet who emancipated himself from the tyranny of the old laws&#8212;hence to be compared to Venantius Fortunatus in the West&#8212;and who boldly struck out the new path of harmonious prose, was S. Anatolius of Constantinople. His commencements were not promising. He had been <i>apocrisiarius</i>, or legate, from the arch-heretic Dioscorus, to the Emperor's Court: and at the death of S. Flavian, in consequence of the violence received in the "<i>Robbers&#8217; Meeting</i>" at Ephesus, A.D. 449, was, by the influence of his Pontiff, raised to the vacant throne of Constantinople.

Having governed his Church eight years in peace, he departed to his rest in A.D. 458. His compositions are not numerous, and are almost all short, but they are usually very spirited.</p>
