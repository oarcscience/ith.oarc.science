Canon for Christmas Day

### ODE III.

by S. Cosmas

τῷ πρὸ τῶν αιώνων.

Him, of the <span class="smallcaps">Father's</span> very Essence,  
  Begotten, ere the world began,  
And, in the latter time, of Mary,  
  Without a human sire, made Man  
       Unto Him, this glorious morn,  
         Be the strain outpoured!  
       Thou That liftest up our horn,  
         Holy art Thou, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!

The earthly Adam, erewhile quickened  
  By the blest breath of <span class="smallcaps">God</span> on high,  
Now made the victim of corruption,  
  By woman's guile betray’d to die, <span id="page_134">p. 134</span>  
       He, deceived by woman's part,  
         Supplication pour’d;  
       Thou Who in my nature art,  
         Holy art Thou, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!

Thou, <span class="smallcaps">Jesus Christ</span>, wast consubstantial  
  With this our perishable clay,  
And, by assuming earthly nature,  
  Exaltedst it to heavenly day.  
       Thou, That wast as mortal born,  
         Being <span class="smallcaps">God</span> ador’d,  
       Thou That liftest up our horn,  
         Holy art Thou, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>!

Rejoice, O Bethlehem, the city  
  Whence Judah's monarchs had their birth;  
Where He that sitteth on the Cherubs,  
  The King of Israel, came on earth: <span id="page_135">p. 135</span>  
       Manifested this blest morn,  
         As of old time never,  
       He hath lifted up our horn,  
         He shall reign for ever!
