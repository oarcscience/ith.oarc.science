Canon for Apocreos

### ODE IX.

by Theodore of the Studium

Ὁ Κύριος ἔρχεται.

The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> draws nigh, the righteous
Throne's Assessor,  
The just to save, to punish the transgressor:  
        Weep we, and mourn, and pray,  
        Regardful of that day;  
When all the secrets of all hearts shall be  
Lit with the blaze of full eternity.

Clouds and thick darkness o’er the Mount assembling,  
Moses beheld the Eternal's glory, trembling:  
        And yet he might but see  
        <span class="smallcaps">God's</span> feebler Majesty. <span
id="page_182">p. 182</span>  
And I—I needs must view His fullest Face:  
O spare me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! O take me to Thy grace!

David of old beheld, in speechless terror,  
The session of the Judge—the doom of error:  
        And what have I to plead  
        For mercy in my need?  
Nothing save this: O grant me yet to be,  
Ere that day come, renewed and true to Thee!

Here, fires of deep damnation roar and glitter:  
The worm is deathless, and the cup is bitter:  
        There, day that hath no morrow,  
        And joy that hath no sorrow:  
And who so blest that he shall fly the abyss,  
Rais’d up to <span class="smallcaps">God</span>'S Right Hand, and
speechless bliss!

My soul with many an act of sin is wounded:  
With mortal weakness is my frame surrounded: <span id="page_183">p.
183</span>  
        My life is well nigh o’er:  
        The Judge is at the door  
How wilt thou, miserable spirit, fare,  
What time He sends His summons through the air?
