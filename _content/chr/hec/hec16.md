### TROPARIA FOR PALM SUNDAY.

by S. Andrew of Crete.

<span class="small">The following Stanzas are from the Triodion sung at
Compline on Palm Sunday: which has the same name among the Greeks as
among ourselves.</span>

Ἰησοῦς ὑπὲρ τοῦ κόσμου.

<span class="smallcaps">Jesus</span>, hastening for the world to
suffer,  
  Enters in, Jerusalem, to thee:  
With His Twelve He goeth forth to offer  
  That free sacrifice He came to be.

They that follow Him with true affection  
  Stand prepared to suffer for His Name:  
Be we ready then for man's rejection,  
  For the mockery, the reproach, the shame.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

Now, in sorrow, sorrow finds its healing:  
  In the form wherein our father fell,  
<span class="smallcaps">Christ</span> appears, those quick’ning Wounds
revealing,  
  Which shall save from sin and death and hell.

Now, Judæa, call thy Priesthood nigh thee!  
  Now for Deicide prepare thy hands!  
Lo I thy Monarch, meek and gentle by thee!!  
  Lo! the Lamb and Shepherd in thee stands!

To thy Monarch, Salem, give glad greeting!  
  Willingly He hastens to be slain  
For the multitude His entrance meeting  
  With their false Hosanna's ceaseless strain.  
       "Blest is He That comes," they cry,  
       "On the Cross for man to die!"
