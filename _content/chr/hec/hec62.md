### STARS OF THE MORNING.

by S. Joseph of the Studium

<span class="small">A Cento from the Canon of the "Bodiless Ones;"
Tuesday in the Week of the Fourth Tone.</span>

Stars of the morning, so gloriously bright,  
Fill’d with celestial resplendence and light;  
These that, where night never followeth day,  
Raise the Trishagion ever and aye:

These are Thy counsellors: these dost Thou own,  
<span class="smallcaps">God</span> of Sabaoth! the nearest Thy throne;  
These are Thy ministers; these dost Thou send,  
Help of the helpless ones! man to defend.

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

These keep the guard, amidst Salem's dear bowers:  
Thrones, Principalities, Virtues, and Powers:  
Where with the Living Ones, mystical Four,  
Cherubin, Seraphin, bow and adore.

"Who like the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>? "—thunders Michael,
the Chief:  
Raphael, "the Cure of <span class="smallcaps">God</span>," comforteth
grief:  
And, as at Nazareth, prophet of peace,  
Gabriel, "the Light of <span class="smallcaps">God</span>," bringeth
release.

Then, when the earth was first pois’d in mid-space,  
Then, when the planets first sped on their race,—  
Then, when were ended the six days' employ,—  
Then all the sons of <span class="smallcaps">God</span> shouted for joy.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

Still let them succour us; still let them fight,  
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of angelic hosts, battling for
right!  
Till, where their anthems they ceaselessly pour,  
We with the Angels may bow and adore!

\[No. 6 in H.E.C\]
