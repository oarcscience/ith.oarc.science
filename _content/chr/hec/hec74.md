### <span style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Euthymius.</span>

\+ A.D. 910.

Euthymius, usually known as Syngelus, (the same as *Syncellus*, the
confidential Deacon of the Patriarch of Constantinople,) who died about
916, is the author of a Penitential Canon to S Mary, which is highly
esteemed in the East. It would scarcely, however, be possible to make
even a Cento from it which would be acceptable to the English reader.
