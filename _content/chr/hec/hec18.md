### STICHERA FOR THE SECOND WEEK OF THE GREAT FAST.

by S. Andrew of Crete.

οὐ γὰρ βλὲπεις τοὺς ταράττοντας.

Christian! dost thou *see* them  
  On the holy ground,  
How the troops of Midian  
  Prowl and prowl around? <span id="page_83">p. 83</span>  
Christian! up and smite them,  
  Counting gain but loss:  
Smite them by the merit  
  Of the Holy Cross!

Christian! dost thou *feel* them,  
  How they work within,  
Striving, tempting, luring,  
  Goading into sin?  
Christian! never tremble!  
  Never be down-cast!  
Smite them by the virtue  
  Of the Lenten Fast!

Christian! dost thou *hear* them,  
  How they speak thee fair?  
"Always fast and vigil?  
  Always watch and prayer?"  
Christian! say but boldly:  
  "While I breathe, I pray:" <span id="page_84">p. 84</span>  
Peace shall follow battle,  
  Night shall end in day.

"Well I know thy trouble,  
  O my servant true;  
Thou art very weary,—  
  I was weary too:  
But that toil shall make thee,  
  Some day, all Mine own:  
But the end of sorrow  
  Shall be near My Throne."

\[In H. E. C., where it is No. 2. Also, as *Fortitude, a Sacred Song*,
by M. E. H. S. This is, of course, not intended to be used in Church;
but, as a song, it is extremely pretty.\]
