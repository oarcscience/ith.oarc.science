### <span style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Metrophanes of Smyrna.</span>

\+ circ. A.D. 910.

He was Bishop of that See towards the close of the ninth century, and is
principally famous for his Canons in honour of the Blessed <span
class="smallcaps">Trinity</span>,—eight in number, one to each Tone.
They are sung at Matins on Sundays: and if the writer has not always
been able to fuse his learning and orthodoxy into poetry, nor yet to
escape the tautology of his brother bards, these compositions are
stately and striking. Metrophanes was a vigorous supporter of S.
Ignatius; and the partisan of Rome in her contest with Photius.

It would be impossible, without wearying the reader, to translate the
whole of one of the Triadic Canons; but a Cento from one of them may not
be unacceptable.
