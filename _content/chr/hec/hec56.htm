<p align="center"><font size="-1" color="green">by Theodore of the Studium</font></p>  
<p>The first Sunday in Lent is kept in memory: primarily, of the final triumph of the Church over the Iconoclasts in 842; and, incidentally, of her victory over all other heresies. It has a kind of comminution appropriate to itself alone. The fallowing Canon is ascribed to S. Theodore of the Studium, though Baronius has thought that it cannot be his, because it implies that peace was restored to the Church, whereas that hymnographer died while the persecution still continued. Very possibly, however, it was written en the temporary victory of the Church, which did occur in the time of S. Theodore; and then, in 842, may have been lengthened and adapted to</p>  
<p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="green">p. 185</font></A></p>  
<p>the then state of things, perhaps by Naucratius, the favourite disciple of S. Theodore. It is, perhaps, the most spirited of all the Canons, though many of its expressions savour too much of bitterness and personal feeling to be well defended, and the reader must constantly bear in mind that the poet feels the cause, not so much of Icons, as of the Incarnation itself, to be at stake. I have only given about one-third of the poem. The stanzas are these: Ode I. Tropar. I, 2; III. 6; IV. 1, 2, 3; V. 1, 3, 4, 5; VI. 1; IX. 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>

<p>A song, a song of gladness!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A song of thanks and praise<br> The horn of our salvation<br> Hath <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God</span> vouchsafed to raise! <a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="green">p. 186</font></A><br> A monarch true and faithful,<br> And glorious in her might,<br> To champion <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Christ's</span> own quarrel,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And Orthodoxy's right!</p>  
<p>Now manifest is glory;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Now grace and virtue shine:<br> Now joys the Church regaining<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Her ornaments divine:<br> And girds them on in gladness,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As fits a festal day,<br> After long months of struggle,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Long years of disarray.</p>  
<p>Now cries the blood for vengeance,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;By persecutors poured,<br> Of them that died defending<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The likeness of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>: <a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="green">p. 187</font></A><br> The likeness, as a mortal<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That He vouchsaf&#8217;d to take,<br> Long years ago, in Bethlem,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Incarnate for our sake.</p>  
<p>Awake, O Church, and triumph<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Exult, each realm and land!<br> And open let the houses,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The ascetic houses stand!<br> And let the holy virgins<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With joy and song take in<br> Their relics and their Icons,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who died this day to win!</p>  
<p>Assemble ye together<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;So joyous and so bold,<br> The ascetic troops, and pen them<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Once more within the fold! <a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 188</font></A><br> If strength again he gather,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Again the foe shall fall:<br> If counsel he shall counsel,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Our <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God</span> shall scatter all.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span>, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> hath triumphed:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Let all the world rejoice!<br> Hush&#8217;d is the turmoil, silent<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His servants&#8217; tearful voice: <a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="green">p. 189</font></A><br> And the One Faith, the True Faith,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Goes forth from East to West,<br> Enfolding, in its beauty,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The earth as with a vest.</p>  
<p>They rise, the sleepless watchmen<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the Church's wall;<br> With yearning supplication<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;On <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God</span> the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> they call:<br> And He, though long time silent,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bow'd down a gracious ear,<br> His people's earnest crying<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And long complaint to hear.</p>  
<p>Sing, sing for joy, each desert!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Exult, each realm of earth<br> Ye mountains, drop down sweetness!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ye hillocks, leap for mirth! <a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="green">p. 190</font></A><br> For <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Christ</span> the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Word</span>, bestowing<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His blessed peace on men,<br> In Faith's most holy union<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hath knit His Church again.</p>  
<p>The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">God</span> of vengeance rises:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Christ</span> attacks the foe,<br> And makes His servants mighty<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The wicked to o&#8217;erthrow:<br> And now Thy condescension<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In boldness may we hymn,<br> And now in peace and safety<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy sacred Image limn.</p>  
<p>O <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span> of loving kindness,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How wondrous are Thy ways!<br> What tongue of man suffices<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy gentleness to praise? <a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="green">p. 191</font></A><br> Because of Thy dear Image<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Men dared Thy Saints to kill,<br> Yet didst Thou not consume them,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But bear&#8217;st their insults still.</p>  
<p>Thou Who has fixed unshaken<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy Church's mighty frame,<br> So that hell-gates shall never<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Prevail against the same;&#8212;<br> Bestow upon Thy people<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy peace, that we may bring<br> One voice, one hymn, one spirit,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To glorify our King!</p>
