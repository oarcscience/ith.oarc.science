<CENTER><H1>The Corpus Hermeticum</H1></CENTER>

The Corpus Hermeticum are the core documents of the Hermetic tradition. 

Dating from early in the Christian era, they were mistakenly dated to a 

much earlier period by Church officials (and everyone else) up until the 

15th century. Because of this, they were allowed to survive and we seen 

as an early precursor to what was to be Christianity. We know today that 

they were, in fact, from the early Christian era, and came out of the 

turbulent religious seas of Hellenic Egypt.<p>

These are all taken  from Mead's translations, which are in the public

domain at this point.<p>
