<P><SMALL>A street of private houses recently excavated in the city of "Ur of the Chaldees." The houses were built about 2100 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL>, <I>i.e.</I> about the time when Abraham and his father Terah were living in Ur; this street must have been seen by these patriarchs. They are the first private houses of the period to be discovered, and their state of preservation is such that it is possible to reconstruct the general plan of the house of a well-to-do citizen of Ur. (<I>See</I> <A HREF="bct12.htm#pl12">page 284</A>.)</SMALL></P>
