<BLOCKQUOTE>[THE FIFTH THOUSAND YEARS. FROM THE TWENTY-SIXTH YEAR OF EHUD'S LIFE TO THE SECOND YEAR OF THE REIGN OF CYRUS.]</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N&acirc;bh&icirc;n (Jabin), who was dried up in body, ruled twenty years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deborah and Barak [ruled them] forty years. The children [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_30b2"></A>Fol. 30<I>b</I>, col. 2</FONT>] of Israel were in subjection to the Midianites seven years, and God delivered them by the hands of Gideon, who ruled them forty years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abimelech his son reigned after him three years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T&ucirc;la` (Tola), the son of Puah [ruled them] twenty-three years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y&acirc;&icirc;r, the Gileadite, twenty-two years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again the children of Israel were in subjection to the Ammonites eighteen years, and God delivered them by the hand of Naphta<U>h</U> (Jephthah), the man who offered up his daughter as a sacrifice, and he ruled them six years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abh&icirc;<U>s</U>&acirc;n (Ibzan of Bethlehem), who is Na<U>h</U>sh&ocirc;n (<I>sic</I>), ruled them seven years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al&ocirc;n (Elon), who was from Zebulon, ruled them ten years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Abhr&ocirc;n (Abdon, the son of Hillel, the Pirathonite) ruled them eight years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the children of Israel were in subjection to the Philistines forty years, and God delivered them by the hand of Samson, and he ruled them twenty years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_31a1"></A>Fol. 31<I>a</I>, col. 1</FONT>] children of Israel lived without a governor for eighteen years, and then Eli the priest rose up and ruled them forty years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Samuel rose up over them and ruled them twenty years. And in the days of Samuel the children of Israel provoked to wrath God, Who had delivered them from the servitude of the Egyptians, and they made Saul, the son of Kish, king, and he reigned over them forty years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the days of Saul lived G&ucirc;ly&acirc;dh (Goliath), a giant of the Philistines. He came nigh and reviled Israel, and blasphemed against God, and David, the son of Jesse, killed him. And David was praised in songs by the daughters of Israel, and Saul persecuted him. And the Philistines slew Saul because he forsook the Lord, and took refuge with the devils.</P>

<A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A>

as found in an Egyptian papyrus in the Royal Library at Berlin. Sanehat fled from Egypt as the result of some political trouble, and made his way into Palestine, where he settled down and prospered, and became a sh&ecirc;kh of great influence and importance. Then a certain man of Thennu went to Sanehat's tent and reviled him, and challenged him to fight him. This man was a mighty warrior, and was famed throughout the country for his strength, and valour, and success. During the following night Sanehat made ready his dagger, and spear, and bow, and at daybreak all the tribes came to the place to witness the great duel which was to take place. The man of Thennu grasped his shield and his battle-axe, and then began to hurl his spears at Sanehat, but they either went wide or Sanehat managed in some way to avoid them; in any case, they failed to touch him. When the man of Thennu saw this, he lost his temper, and made a rush at Sanehat, meaning to close with him and despatch him with his battle-axe. But as he came on in his mad rage Sanehat hurled his short javelin at his head, and it pierced his neck and remained fast in it. The man of Thennu uttered a prolonged shriek and then fell headlong on the ground, face downwards. Sanehat went to him, and, taking his foe's weapons from him, killed him with them. Then

he took his stand on the dead body, and shouted the cry of victory, and the onlookers rejoiced in his triumph and applauded him.<BIG><B>]</B></BIG></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David reigned over [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_31a2"></A>Fol. 31<I>a</I>, col. 2</FONT>] the children of Israel forty years, and Solomon, his son, reigned forty years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Solomon did great and wonderful things, and it was he who sent to Ophir and brought gold from the mountains of gold, and the ships sailed the sea for thirty-six months, and then came forth (<I>i.e.</I> returned). It was he who built Tadmor (Palmyra) in the wilderness, and he carried out there great and wonderful works. And when Solomon passed the borders of the mountain which is called S&acirc;`&ecirc;r, he found there the altar which P&icirc;&ocirc;rz&acirc;kh&acirc;r, and P&icirc;&ocirc;rz&acirc;n&acirc;i, and Nezn&acirc;dh&ocirc;r had built. These were they whom Nimrod, the giant, sent to Balaam, the priest of the Mountain of S&acirc;`&ecirc;r, because he heard that he was wont to consult the Signs of the Zodiac, and when they were passing the skirts of the mountain they built there an altar to the sun. And when Solomon saw it he built a city there and called its name "N&icirc;&acirc;p&ocirc;l&icirc;s " (more correctly, Heliopolis) [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_31b1"></A>Fol. 31<I>b</I>, col. 1</FONT>], that is to say, "City of the Sun." And Solomon also built Aradus (Arvad) in the midst of the sea, and he became so famous and renowned

<!------------------------page 172------------------------>

<A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A>

that the report of his wise acts went out into all the ends of the earth. And the Queen of Sheba went to hold converse with him. And Solomon loved Hiram, king of Tyre, greatly. And Hiram reigned in Tyre five hundred years, from the days of the kingdom of David to the [days of] the kingdom of Zedekiah and of all the kings of the children of Israel. And at length he forgot that he was a man, and he blasphemed and said, "I am God, and I sit upon the throne of God in the middle of the sea." And Nebuchadnezzar the king killed him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BIG><B>[</B></BIG>NOTE.--Solomon reigned over his large kingdom with the greatest wisdom ever found. But he did not keep his soul; but inclined his heart to the love of women, and forsook God, Who had created him and given him his kingdom. And he died in his denial of Him, and in his sins. <I>Book of Adam</I> (iv. 8.)<BIG><B>]</B></BIG></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[The purple linen of Tyre.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the days of Hiram the purple-[coloured] apparel worn by kings [first] appeared. As a dog was running along the sea-shore [at Tyre] he saw a purple shell-fish (<I>i.e.</I> the murex) coming up out of the [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_31b2"></A>Fol. 31<I>b</I>, col. 2</FONT>] water, and he bit it, and straightway his mouth was filled with the blood of that shell-fish. And a certain

<!------------------------page 173------------------------>

<A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A>

shepherd who saw the dog brought a piece of woollen cloth and wiped the dog's mouth with it. And he made that piece of woollen cloth into a crown (<I>i.e.</I> a <I>kaf&icirc;yah</I> or head-cloth), and set it upon his head, and as he walked along in the sun, those who saw him thought that rays of fire were coming forth from his head, and when Hiram heard [of this] he sent for the man. And when he saw the woollen cloth he marvelled, and was astonished. And all the dyers gathered together and marvelled at it, and they set out to enquire into the matter; and they found some of these shell-fish and rejoiced greatly.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[The Apostasy of Solomon.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Solomon waxed exceedingly great. And the food [provided for his table every day] consisted of forty oxen, one hundred head of sheep, thirty measures of fine flour, sixty measures of wheat, and three hundred measures of wine; and besides all this [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_32a1"></A>Fol. 32<I>a</I>, col. 1</FONT>], stags, and gazelle, and wild antelopes, and other creatures of the desert. And he became froward and transgressed the Law, and hearkened not to the commands of his father, and he took to wife one thousand women from all the peoples whom God hated. And in the time of his old age he gave himself up to women, and he let them play with him, and he hearkened to their words, and did

<!------------------------page 174------------------------>

<A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A>

their will. And he denied the God of David, his father. And he builded altars to devils, and offered up sacrifices to idols and graven images, and he worshipped the work of the hands; and God turned away His face from him and he died. And he reigned in Jerusalem forty-six years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BIG><B>[</B></BIG>NOTE.--Solomon was seduced into idolatry by his wife, the daughter of Pharaoh. "One day she beautified and scented herself for him, and she behaved herself haughtily towards him, and treated him disdainfully. And he said unto her, 'What shall I do? Thou hast made thy face evil towards me, and thy regard towards me is not as it was formerly, and thy beautiful form is not as enticing as usual. Ask me, and I will give thee whatsoever thou wishest, and I will perform it for thee, so that thou mayest make thy face gracious towards me as formerly'; but she held her peace and answered him never a word. And he repeated to her the words that he would do whatsoever she wished. And she said unto him, 'Swear to me by the God of Israel that thou wilt not play me false.' And he swore to her that he would give her whatsoever she asked for, and that he would do for her everything she told him. And she tied a scarlet thread on the middle of the door of [the

<!------------------------page 175------------------------>

<A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A>

house of] her gods, and she brought three locusts and set them in the house of her gods. And she said unto Solomon, 'Come to me without breaking the scarlet thread, bend thyself and kill these locusts before me, and pull out their necks,' and he did so. And she said unto him, 'I will henceforward do thy will, for thou hast sacrificed to my gods and hast worshipped them.' Now he had done this because of his oath, so that he might not break his oath which she had made him to swear, even though he knew that it was an offence (or, sin) to enter into the house of her gods." <I>Kebra Nagast</I> (chapter lxiv).<BIG><B>]</B></BIG></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[Rehoboam.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, reigned after him. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when [he began] to reign, and he polluted Jerusalem with fornication, and the altars of devils, and the stink of heathendom; and the kingdom of Israel was rent in twain. And in the fifth year [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_32a2"></A>Fol. 32<I>a</I>, col. 2</FONT>] of his kingdom Shishak, the king of Egypt, went up against Jerusalem. And he carried off all the treasure of the service of the house of the Lord, and all the treasure of the kingdom of David, and of that of Solomon, and the vessels of gold and the vessels of silver. And he magnified himself and said, "I am not

<A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A>

taking away treasure which is yours but the wealth which your fathers tok out of Egypt." And Rehoboam died in the heathen practices of his father Solomon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Shishak was the first king of the XXIInd Dynasty and reigned about 20 years (947-928 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL>): he was of Libyan origin. The Egyptian form of his name is S<SMALL>HASHANQ</SMALL> <IMG SRC="176-1.jpg" ALIGN="absmiddle" ALT="hieroglyphics">, and it is found with his title "beloved of Amen" in a cartouche thus: <IMG SRC="176-2.jpg" ALIGN="absmiddle" ALT="hieroglyphics">.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Abijah his son reigned after him and he destroyed Jerusalem with fornication and with heathen works--now, Melk&acirc;, the mother of `Abhd-Sh&acirc;l&ocirc;m, was his mother--and he died in the heathen practices of his father.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Asa his son reigned after him for forty years in Jerusalem. He did that which was good before the Lord, and he put away fornication from Jerusalem, and made an end of the heathen practices of his people, for he kept the commandments of God [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_32b1"></A>Fol. 32<I>b</I>, col. 1</FONT>]. And he drove them (<I>i.e.</I> the idolators) out of his palace (or, kingdom), and made them to be a mockery before all the people, because they [taught] the offering of sacrifices to idols. And Zerah of Judah went up against him, and God humbled him before Asa. And Asa died in righteousness like his father David.</P>

No mention of Zerah the Cushite has hitherto been found in the cuneiform or hieroglyphic inscriptions.<BIG><B>]</B></BIG></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jehosaphat his son reigned after him, and he walked in the ways of Asa his father, and he did that which was pleasing before God. And God was angry with him because he was a friend of the house of Ahab, and for this reason God did not permit him to bring out gold from Ophir. Now he made ships to send thither, and they were broken at Ezion Geber. He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and the name of his mother was `Az&ocirc;bh&acirc; (Azuba ?), the daughter of Sh&acirc;l&acirc;h. And Jehosaphat died in his righteousness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahaziah his son reigned after him, and he was twenty-two years old when [he began] to reign; he lived for one year in Jerusalem, and did evil things before God in that year. Because of the wickedness and iniquity which he wrought, God delivered him into the hands of his enemies and they killed him. When he was dead his mother [Athaliah] killed all the royal children of the house of David, imagining that she would uproot the children of the Jews. The only person of the seed of the royal house whom she did not slay was Joash, whom Y&ocirc;shba` (Jehosheba), the daughter of Joram, the son of Jehosaphat, carried away secretly and hid [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_33a1"></A>Fol. 33<I>a</I>, col. 1</FONT>] with her in her house.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[Reign of Ahab's sister.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sister of Ahab reigned seven years in Jerusalem. And she polluted the city with fornication, for she commanded the women to play the whore without fear, and the men to commit adultery with the wives of their neighbours without incurring any penalty. And she herself committed fornication like Jezebel, and she adopted all the heathen practices of the house of Ahab in Jerusalem.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[Reign of Joash.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after seven years the children of Jerusalem considered whom they should make their king,

<A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A>

and Jehoiada the priest gathered them together in the house of the Lord, in the temple which Solomon had built. And when the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds had gathered together, Jehoiada the priest said unto them, "Whom say ye shall be king and sit upon the throne of David except [he be] a king and the son of a king?" And when he showed him [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_33a2"></A>Fol. 33<I>a</I>, col. 2</FONT>] to them they rejoiced with an exceedingly great joy. And the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the "runners," and the messengers brought the kingdom to the house of the Lord, and the soldiers who were armed surrounded him on all sides; and Jehoiada the priest set him (<I>i.e.</I> Joash) upon the throne of David his father. And [Joash] was seven years old when [he began] to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was <U>S</U>&ucirc;bh&acirc; (Zibea) and she was from Beersheba. And Athaliah [the mother of Ahaziah] was killed. And Joash requited with evil the kindness which Jehoiada had done him, and after his death he shed the innocent blood of his sons. And Joash died, and Amaziah his son reigned after him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uzziah was sixteen years old when [he began] to reign, and he reigned fifty (<I>sic</I>) years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was &Icirc;kh&acirc;ny&acirc; (Jechalia). And he did that which was good before the Lord. Now, he made bold to go into the Holy of Holies, and he took the censer from the priest of God (Azariah), and burned incense in the temple of the Lord; and because he did this leprosy covered his face. And because Isaiah the prophet did not rebuke him, he was prevented from prophesying until Uzziah died. And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jotham was twenty-five years old when [he began] to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was &Icirc;r&ucirc;sh&acirc; (Jerusa), the daughter of Zadok.

<P ALIGN="center">[Ahaz a vassal of the King of Assyria.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahaz was twenty years old when [he began] to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_33b2"></A>Fol. 33<I>b</I>, col. 2</FONT>]; and the name of his mother was `Aphin, the daughter of Levi.

And Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria the gold and silver [which were in] the house of the Lord, [and in his days] the children of Israel were carried off into captivity. And the king sent for the men who had come from Babel, so that they might dwell in the land instead of the children of Israel, because they could kill the lions. And the king of Assyria sent to them &Ocirc;r&icirc; [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_34a1"></A>Fol. 34<I>a</I>, col. 1</FONT>] the priest, and he taught them the laws.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hezekiah became sick unto death [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_34a2"></A>Fol. 34<I>a</I>, col. 2</FONT>], and it was grievous unto him, and he wept. And there were certain men who blamed him, but why [his sickness] was grievous unto him they never troubled to acquaint themselves. Now the sorrow of Hezekiah [came upon him]

because when he became sick unto death he had no son to reign after him. And when he looked with the eyes of his soul and saw that he had no son to reign after him, he was afflicted, and wept and said, "Woe is me! for I must die childless, and that blessing which hath been given [unto us] for six and forty generations hath been cut off by me this day. I have become the destroyer of the kingdom of David, and the succession of the kings of Judah hath been cut off this day." This was [the cause of] the sorrow of Hezekiah. And after he recovered from his sickness he waited fourteen years, and [then] Manasseh was born to him. And Hezekiah died in great content, and left a son to sit upon the throne of David [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_34b1"></A>Fol. 34<I>b</I>, col. 1</FONT>] his father.</P>

He was a man who was more evil and iniquitous than all those who had lived before him; he builded altars to devils, and sacrificed to idols, and he filled Jerusalem with iniquity and provoked God to wrath. And because Isaiah the prophet rebuked him, he threatened him and sent men who were sons of iniquity, and they sawed Isaiah the prophet in

And Isaiah was one hundred and twenty years old when they sawed him in twain, and he had been the prophet of God for ninety years. And Manasseh repented after he had slain Isaiah, and he put sackcloth on his body, and decreed fasting for himself, and he ate bread with tears all the days of his life because he had committed iniquity and had [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_34b2"></A>Fol. 34<I>b</I>, col. 2</FONT>] slain the prophet.

And Simeon the high priest, because he had freedom of speech with the commander of the [Chaldean] army, made entreaty to him, and the commander of the army gave him all the books of the Scriptures and did not burn them; and Simeon the high priest gathered them together and cast them into a pit (or dry well). And Jerusalem was laid waste and made desolate, and no man remained therein except Jeremiah, the Prophet, who sat and raised lamentations over it for twenty years.

And when they were gathered together Cyrus said unto Zerubbabel, his wife's brother, "Rise up, and take with thee all the children of thy people, and go up to Jerusalem in peace; and [re]build the city of thy fathers, and dwell and reign therein. And because Cyrus brought about the return of the children of Israel [to Jerusalem], God said, "I have taken my servant Cyrus by his right hand" (<A HREF="../../bib/kjv/isa.htm#44:28">Isa. xliv. 28</A>; xlv. 1). And the name of Cyrus was called "My shepherd, the anointed of the Lord," because his seed was received into the seed of David through Meshayyanath, the sister of Zerubbabel, whom he had taken to wife. And the children of Israel went up from Babel, and Zerubbabel became king over them; and Joshua, the son of Y&ocirc;z&acirc;d&acirc;k, the son of Aaron, was high priest, even as the angel showed Zechariah the prophet, and said unto him, "These are the sons of the oil of consecration."</P>
