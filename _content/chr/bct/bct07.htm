<P ALIGN="center">[THE FOURTH THOUSAND YEARS--FROM THE REIGN OF REU TO THE TWENTY-SIXTH YEAR OF THE LIFE OF EHUD.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the days of Reu the Mesr&acirc;y&ecirc;, who are the Egyptians, appointed their first king; his name was Pun<U>t</U>os, and he reigned over them sixty-eight years. And in the days of Reu a king reigned in Shebh&acirc; (S&acirc;ba), and in Ophir, and in Havilah. And there reigned in S&acirc;ba sixty of the daughters of S&acirc;ba. And for many years women reigned in S&acirc;ba--until the kingdom of Solomon, the son of David. And the children of Ophir, that is, Send (Scindia ?), appointed to be their [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_23a1"></A>Fol. 23<I>a</I>, col. 1</FONT>] Lophoron (?), who built Ophir with stones of gold; now, all the stones that are in Ophir are of gold. And the children of Havilah appointed to be their king <U>H</U>av&icirc;l, who built Havilah, that is, Hend (India ?).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BIG><B>[</B></BIG>NOTES.--According to the <I>Book of Adam</I> (iii. 23), the first king of Egypt was called Yanuf; he built Memphis, that is, Mi<U>s</U>r. Sasen reigned

in S&acirc;ba and built the city of S&acirc;ba, the people of which are called "Sabeans." Bahlul, builder of Bahlu, reigned over Lebensa in India. The first king of S&acirc;ba is said to have been Menyelek I, the son of Solomon king of Mael and M&acirc;<U>k</U>eda, Queen of Sheba.<BIG><B>]</B></BIG></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Reu died, being two hundred and thirty-nine years old, and Serug his son, and N&acirc;<U>h</U>&ocirc;r and Tarah (Tera<U>h</U>) buried him in Aor`&icirc;n, the city which he built after his own name.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Serug lived thirty years and begot N&acirc;<U>h</U>&ocirc;r, and all the days of his life were two hundred and thirty years. And in the days of Serug the worship of idols entered the world. And in his days the children of men began to make themselves graven images, and it was at this time that the introduction of idols into the world took place. For the children of men were scattered all over the earth, and they had neither teachers nor lawgivers, and no one to show them [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_23a2"></A>Fol. 23<I>a</I>, col. 2</FONT>] the way of truth wherein they should walk, and for this reason they became confused and fell into error. Some of them through their error adored the heavens, and some of them worshipped the sun, and moon and stars, and some of them the earth, and wild beasts, and birds, and creeping things, and trees, and stones, and the creatures of the sea, and

<!------------------------page 138------------------------>

<A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A>

the waters, and the winds. Now Satan had blinded their eyes so that they might walk in the darkness of error, because they had no hope of a resurrection. For when one of them died they used to make an image of him, and set it up upon his grave, so that the remembrance [of his appearance] might not pass from before their eyes. And error having been sown broadcast in all the earth, the land became filled with idols in the form of men and women. And then Serug died, being two hundred and thirty years old, and N&acirc;<U>h</U>&ocirc;r, and Tarah [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_23b1"></A>Fol. 23<I>b</I>, col. 1</FONT>], and Abraham his sons, buried him in Sargh&icirc;n, the city which he built after his own name.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And N&acirc;<U>h</U>&ocirc;r was twenty-nine years old when he begot Terah. And in the days of N&acirc;<U>h</U>&ocirc;r, in the seventieth year of his life, when God looked upon the children of men, and saw that they were worshipping idols, a great earthquake took place, and all their houses were overturned and fell down; but the people did not understand within themselves, and they added to their wickedness. And N&acirc;<U>h</U>&ocirc;r died when he was one hundred and forty-seven years old, and Terah his son and Abraham buried him. Terah was seventy-five years old when he begot Abraham.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BIG><B>[</B></BIG>NOTES.--N&acirc;<U>h</U>&ocirc;r was the son of Serug by his wife Melka, and he married Iyosaka, the daughter

of Kheber, the Chaldean, and she became the mother of Terah. The "Wind Flood" came upon the earth in the days of N&acirc;<U>h</U>&ocirc;r. God opened the storehouse of the winds and whirlwinds, and they uprooted the idols and graven images, and they collected them together, and buried them under the earth, and they reared over them these mounds that are in the world. (<A HREF="../bb/bb23"><I>Book of the Bee</I>, chapter xxiii.</A>) God sent forth winds, and the whirlwind, and earthquakes on the earth, until the idols were broken one against another. Instead of repenting, men added to their sins. <I>Book of Adam</I> (iii. 24.)<BIG><B>]</B></BIG></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Terah was seventy-five years old when he begat Abraham. And in the days of Terah, in his ninetieth year, sorcery appeared on the earth in the city of A&ocirc;r (Ur), which Horon, the son of `Abh&acirc;r, built. Now, there was in the city a certain man who was very rich, and he died at that time. And his son made an image of him in gold [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_23b2"></A>Fol. 23<I>b</I>, col. 2</FONT>], and set it up upon his grave, and he appointed there a young man to keep guard over it. And Satan went and took up his abode in that image, and he spake to that youth (<I>i.e.</I> the son of the rich man) after the manner of his father. And thieves went into [his house], and took everything that the youth possessed, and he went out to the tomb of his

father weeping. And Satan spake unto him, saying, "Weep not in my presence, but go and fetch thy little son, and slay him here as a sacrifice to me, and forthwith everything which thou hast lost shall be returned to me here." And straightway the youth did as Satan told him, and he slew his son, and bathed in his blood. And Satan went forth immediately from that image [of gold], and entered into the youth, and taught him sorcery, and enchantments, and divination, and the lore of the Chaldeans, and [how to tell] fortunes, and [how to forecast] events, and [how to foretell] destinies. And behold, from that time the children of men began to sacrifice their sons to devils and to worship idols, for the devils entered into the images, and took up their abodes therein.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BIG><B>[</B></BIG>NOTES.--According to the <I>Book of Adam</I> (iii. 24), the young man who ministered to the image had to sweep the ground around it, and to pour out water before it, and to burn incense. The image seems to have resembled somewhat the Ka-figure of the Egyptians, and its attendant may be regarded as the equivalent of the Ka-priest. A marginal note in the Syriac MS. of the "Cave of Treasures" in the British Museum says that the city A&ocirc;r is Erech (Warka). The "Interpreter" (<I>i.e.</I> Theodore), says it was B&ecirc;th

<!------------------------page 141------------------------>

<A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A>

M&acirc;h&ocirc;z&ecirc; (Ctesiphon and Seleucia), that is, B&ecirc;th Ar&acirc;m&acirc;y&ecirc;, but both statements are incorrect. The city referred to is Ur, where, in recent years, excavations have been carried out by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania. (<I>See</I> my <I>Babylonian Life and History</I>, London, 1925, and the account of the excavations given at the end of the present work, <A HREF="bct12.htm#page_275">page 275</A>.)<BIG><B>]</B></BIG></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the one hundredth year of the life of N&acirc;<U>h</U>&ocirc;r, when God saw that the children of men were sacrificing their Sons to devils [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_24a1"></A>Fol. 24<I>a</I>, col. 1</FONT>], and worshipping idols, He opened the storehouses of the wind, and the gate of the whirlwind, and a blast of wind went forth in all the earth. And it uprooted the images, and the places where offerings were made to devils, and it swept together the idols, and the images, and the pillared buildings in a heap, and piled up great mounds [of earth] over them; [and they are there] to this day. Now to this blast of wind learned men have given the name of "Wind-Flood"; but certain who have erred have said, "These mounds existed [already] in the days of the Flood [of waters]. Now those who have said these things have erred greatly from the truth; for before the Flood [of waters] there were no idols in the earth, and it was not because of idols that the Flood came, but because of the

<!------------------------page 142------------------------>

<A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A>

fornication of the daughters of Cain. And, moreover, at that time there were no men on this earth, which was a waste and a desert. And our fathers were cast forth in days of old, as it were, into exile, because they were not worthy to be [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_24a2"></A>Fol. 24<I>a</I>, col. 2</FONT>] neighbours of Paradise. And through the Ark they were driven forth to the mountains of <U>K</U>ard&ocirc;, and from there they were scattered about throughout all the earth. For these mounds came into being because of idols, and in them are buried all the idols of that time, and all the devils also who dwell in them are in these mounds, and there is no mound which hath not devils in it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[Nimrod the fire-worshipper, and Y&ocirc;n<U>t</U>&ocirc;n, son of Noah.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the days of Nimrod, the mighty man (or giant), a fire appeared which ascended from the earth, and Nimrod went down, and looked at it, and worshipped it, and he established priests to minister there, and to cast incense into it. From that day the Persians began to worship fire, [and they do so] to this day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And S&icirc;s&acirc;n, the king, found a spring of water in Dr&ocirc;gh&icirc;n, and he made a white horse and set it over it, and those who bathed in the water used to worship the horse [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_24b1"></A>Fol. 24<I>b</I>, col. 1</FONT>]. And from that time the Persians began to worship

<!------------------------page 143------------------------>

<A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A>

that (<I>sic</I>) horse. [According to the <I>Book of Adam</I> (iii. 25), the horse was made of gold.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nimrod went to Y&ocirc;kd&ocirc;r&acirc; of N&ocirc;dh, and when he arrived at the Lake (or Sea) of A<U>t</U>r&acirc;s, he found there Y&ocirc;n<U>t</U>&ocirc;n, the son of Noah. [A marginal note in the Syriac MS. adds, "Noah begot this Y&ocirc;n<U>t</U>&ocirc;n after the Flood, and he honoured him in many things, and sent him to the east to dwell there."] And Nimrod went down and bathed in the Lake, and he came to Y&ocirc;n<U>t</U>&ocirc;n and did homage unto him. And Y&ocirc;n<U>t</U>&ocirc;n said, "Thou art a king; doest thou homage unto me?" And Nimrod said unto him, "It is because of thee that I have come down here"; and he remained with him for three years. And Y&ocirc;n<U>t</U>&ocirc;n taught Nimrod wisdom, and the art of revelation (divining ?), and he said unto him, "Come not back again to me."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Nimrod went up from the east, and began to practise the art of divining, very many men marvelled at him. And when &Icirc;dh&acirc;sh&icirc;r (Ardeshir ?), the priest who ministered to the fire that ascended from the earth, saw that Nimrod was practising these exalted courses, he entreated the devil, who appeared in connection with that fire, to teach him [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_24b2"></A>Fol. 24<I>b</I>, col. 2</FONT>] the wisdom of Nimrod. And as the devils were in the habit of destroying those who came nigh unto them by sin, the devil said unto the priest,

<!------------------------page 144------------------------>

<A NAME="page_144"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 144</FONT></A>

"A man cannot become a priest and a Magian until he hath known carnally his mother, and his daughter, and his sister." And &Icirc;dh&acirc;sh&icirc;r the priest did this, and from that time the priests, and the Magians, and the Persians take their mothers, and their sisters, and their daughters [to wife]. And this &Icirc;dh&acirc;sh&icirc;r, the Magian, was the first to begin to study the Signs of the Zodiac, and [omens concerning] luck, and fate, and happenings, and motions of the eyes and eyelids, as well as all the other arts of the learning of the Chaldees. Now, all this learning is the error of devils, and those who practise it shall receive, together with the devils, the doom of the Judgment. And because this art of divination, which was employed by Nimrod, was taught to him [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_25a1"></A>Fol. 25<I>a</I>, col. 1</FONT>] by Y&ocirc;n<U>t</U>&ocirc;n, none of the orthodox doctors have suppressed it; nay, they have even practised it. Now the Persians call it "Gely&acirc;n&acirc; " (<I>i.e.</I> "Revelation") and the Romans "Estr&ocirc;m&icirc;&ocirc;n" (<I>i.e.</I> "Astronomy"). But that [knowledge] which the Magians have, viz. astrology, is sorcery and the teaching of devils. There are some who say that it doth indeed [teach concerning] luck, and happenings (<I>i.e.</I> future events), and fate, but these are in error. Now Nimrod builded strong cities in the east, Babel, and Nineveh, and R&acirc;s&acirc;n (R&acirc;s `Ain), and Sel&icirc;<U>k</U>: (Seleucia), and Ctesiphon, and &Acirc;dh&ocirc;rbaigh&acirc;n; and he made three fortresses.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[The History of Abraham.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Terah, the father of Abraham, lived two hundred and fifty years, and he died, and Abraham and Lot buried him in H&acirc;rr&acirc;n. And there God spoke unto Abraham, and said unto him, "Get thee forth from thy land, and from among thy people, and come to the land which I will show thee." And Abraham took his household, S&acirc;r&acirc; his wife [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_25a2"></A>Fol. 25<I>a</I>, col. 2</FONT>], and Lot, his brother's son, and he went up to the land of the Am&ocirc;r&acirc;y&ecirc; (Amorites); and he was seventy-five years old when he crossed the desert from the Euphrates. And he was eighty years old when he pursued the kings, and rescued Lot, his brother's son.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BIG><B>[</B></BIG>NOTES.--When still a boy, Abraham had no belief in idols, and, according to the <I>Kebra Nagast</I> (chapter xiii), "when he was twelve years old his father sent him to sell idols. And Abraham said, 'These are not gods that can make deliverance'; and he took away the idols to sell even as his father had commanded him. And he said unto those unto whom he would sell them, 'Do ye wish to buy goods that cannot make deliverance, things made of wood, and stone, and iron, and brass, which the hand of an artificer hath made?' And they (the people) refused to buy the idols from Abraham because

<!------------------------page 146------------------------>

he himself had defamed the images of his father. [An old tradition says that Terah made idols of mud, and it is possible that some of these may be represented by the terra-cotta figures of gods and goddesses which have been found in such large numbers in recent years at Ur and other ancient sites in Babylonia.] And as he was returning he stepped aside from the road, and he set the images down, and looked at them, and said unto them, 'I wonder now if ye are able to do what I ask you at this moment, and whether ye are able to give me bread to eat or water to drink?' And none of them answered him, for they were pieces of stone and wood; and he abused them and heaped revilings upon them, and they spake never a word. And he buffeted the face of one, and kicked another with his feet, and a third he knocked over and broke to pieces with stones, and he said unto them, 'If ye are unable to save yourselves from him that buffeteth you, and ye cannot requite with injury him that injureth you, how can ye be called "gods"? Those who worship you do so in vain, and as for myself I utterly despise you, and ye shall not be my gods.' Then he turned his face to the East, and he stretched out his hands and said, 'Be Thou my God, O Lord, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Creator of the Sun and Moon, Creator of the sea and the

dry land, Maker of the majesty of the heavens and the earth, and of that which is visible and that which is invisible; O Maker of the universe, be Thou my God. I place my trust in Thee, and from this day forth I will place my trust in no other save Thyself.' And then there appeared unto him a chariot of fire which blazed, and Abraham was afraid, and fell on his face on the ground; and God said unto him, 'Fear thou not, stand upright.'"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of the birth of Abraham the house shone with a bright light. Many people fell down, and there was a cry in a loud voice, which said, "Woe is me! Woe is me! For he who shall crush my kingdom hath been born." And he who cried out wept, and described the events which should take place, saying, "It is he who shall burn down my abode." And there were among the people certain men who said, "Kill this child forthwith," and those who spake thus knew well that grace would be given to Abraham. And God set mercy in the heart of the father of Abraham, and he said to the Satans, "Whence come ye, O ye who tell me that I should kill my son who is a gracious gift of God?" And he reared the child . . . . . And Abraham was circumcised by the hand of Gabriel and Michael, who helped him. From the <I>Book of the Mysteries of Heaven and Earth</I>, ed.

<P ALIGN="center">[Abraham and Melchisedek.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at that time Abraham had no son, because S&acirc;r&acirc; was barren.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he returned from the battle of the kings, the agency of God called him, and he crossed the mountain of Y&acirc;bh&ocirc;s (Jebus ?), and Melchisedek, the king of Sh&acirc;l&icirc;m, the priest of the Most High God, went forth to meet him. And when Abraham saw Melchisedek, he made haste and fell upon his face, and did homage to him, and he rose up from the ground and embraced him, and kissed him, and was blessed by him; and Melchisedek blessed Abraham. And Abraham gave Melchisedek tithes of everything which he had with him, and Melchisedek made him to participate in the Holy Mysteries, [of] the bread of the Offering and the wine of redemption. And after [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_25b1"></A>Fol. 25<I>b</I>, col. 1</FONT>] Melchisedek had blessed him, and made him to participate in the Holy Mysteries, God spake unto Abraham, and said unto him, "Thy reward is exceedingly great. Since Melchisedek hath blessed thee, and hath made thee to partake of bread and wine [with him], I also will assuredly bless thee, and I will assuredly multiply thy seed."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Abraham was eighty-six years old Ishmael was born to him by H&acirc;gh&acirc;r, the Egyptian woman, whom Pharaoh had given to

<!------------------------page 149------------------------>

S&acirc;r&acirc; as a handmaiden. Now S&acirc;r&acirc; was the sister of Abraham on the father's side, because Terah took two women to wife. When Y&acirc;wn&ucirc;, the mother of Abraham, died, Terah took to wife a woman whose name was "Naharyath" (or Shalmath, or Tona, or Ta<U>h</U>dif), and of her S&acirc;r&acirc; was born. It was because of this [fact] that Abraham said, "She is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother" (<A HREF="../../bib/kjv/gen.htm#20:2">Gen. xx. 2</A>, 5).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[The Birth of Isaac.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Abraham was ninety-nine [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_25b2"></A>Fol. 25<I>b</I>, col. 2</FONT>] years old when God went into his house and gave S&acirc;r&acirc; a son, and he was one hundred years old when Isaac was born to him. And Isaac was thirteen years old when his father took him and went up to the mountain of Y&acirc;bh&ocirc;s (Jebus) to Melchisedek, the priest of God, the Most High. Now Mount Y&acirc;bh&ocirc;s is the mountain of the Am&ocirc;r&acirc;y&ecirc; (Amorites), and in that place the Cross of Christ was set up, and on it grew the tree which held the ram that saved Isaac. And that same place is the centre of the earth, and the grave of Adam, and the altar of Melchisedek, and Golgotha, and <U>K</U>ar<U>k</U>aft&acirc;, and Gef&icirc;ft&acirc; (Gabbatha). And there David saw the angel bearing the sword of fire. There, too, Abraham took up Isaac his son for a burnt offering, and he saw

the Cross, and Christ [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_26a1"></A>Fol. 26<I>a</I>, col. 1</FONT>], and the redemption of our father Adam. The tree (<I>i.e.</I> thicket) was a symboI of the Cross of Christ our Lord, and the ram [caught] in its branches was the mystery of the manhood of the Word, the Only One. And, because of this, Paul cried out and said, "If they had only known [it] they were not crucifying the Lord of glory." Let the mouths of the heretics be stopped who in their madness impute passibility to the Eternal God.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when Christ was eight days old, Joseph, the betrothed of Mary, rose up to circumcise the Child according to the Law, and he circumcised Him according to the custom that was the Law. In like manner Abraham took up his son as an offering, but he at the same time [fore]saw in this [act] the crucifixion of Christ. And this thing did Christ openly proclaim before the multitudes of the Jews, saying, "Abraham, your father, wanted to see My days, and he saw and was glad" (<A HREF="../../bib/kjv/joh.htm#8:56">John viii. 56</A>). Abraham saw the day of the redemption [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_26a2"></A>Fol. 26<I>a</I>, col. 2</FONT>] of Adam, and he saw and rejoiced, and it was revealed unto him that Christ would suffer on behalf of Adam.</P>

God forbid that there should have been no beginning to his days or end to his life. [The Apostle spake thus] because when Shem, the son of Noah, took away Melchisedek from his parents, no word is said as to how old he was when he went up from the East, and it is not said how old he was at the time of his departure from this world. Now, he was the son of M&acirc;l&acirc;kh, the son of Arpakhshar, the son of Shem, and he was not the son of one of the Patriarchs. And the Apostle said that none of his father's family had ever ministered

And the angels of God were going up and coming down, and the Lord stood at the top of it. And Jacob woke up from his sleep, and said, "This is truly the house of God"; and he took the stone of his pillow, and made it an altar, and he anointed it with oil. And he vowed a vow and said, "Of everything which I have will I tithe for this stone." Now, it is manifest to those who possess understanding that the ladder which Jacob saw symbolizeth the Cross of our Redeemer.

<P ALIGN="center">[Jacob and Baptism.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when God had shown the blessed Jacob the Cross of Christ by means of the Ladder of the Angels, and the coming down of Christ for our redemption, and the Church, the House of God, and the altar by means of the stone, and the offerings by means of the tithes, and the anointing by means of the oil, Jacob again went down to the East that there God might show him baptism. And Jacob looked, and saw, and beheld three flocks of sheep lying down by a well; and there was a great stone placed over the mouth of the well. And Jacob drew nigh, and rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of his mother's brother. And having watered the flocks, he took Rachel and kissed her.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now by "Well" [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_28a2"></A>Fol. 28<I>a</I>, col. 2</FONT>] the blessed Jacob indicated (or, depicted) baptism, which was covered over (<I>i.e.</I> hidden) from the races of men, and generations and tribes. And the three flocks of sheep which were lying down by the well are a type of the three divisions and three groups [who come] for baptism, namely, men and women and children. And that Jacob saw Rachel coming with the flocks, and that he neither embraced her nor kissed her until he had rolled away the stone from the well, and she had watered the flocks, is in accordance with

<!------------------------page 158------------------------>

<A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A>

the law of the sons of the Church, who neither embrace nor kiss the Lamb of Christ until baptism hath opened [the way]; they go down into the waters and put on strength from them and then the sons of the Church embrace and kiss. And as Jacob served with Laban for seven years, and the woman he loved was not given to him, so also was it with the Jews, who served Pharaoh, king of Egypt, in slavery, and went forth. [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_28b1"></A>Fol. 28<I>b</I>, col. 1</FONT>.] For the Covenant of the Church, the Bride of Christ, was not given unto them, but that Covenant which was old, and worn out, and of no effect. Now the eyes of [Leah], the first woman whom Jacob took to wife, were hateful, whilst the eyes of Rachel were beautiful, and her countenance was radiant. A covering (<I>i.e.</I> veil) was laid over the face of the first Covenant, so that the children of Israel might not see the beauty thereof; as for the second Covenant, it is wholly light.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan and Naphtali were the sons of Bilhah, the handmaiden of Rachel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after twenty years Jacob returned to Isaac his father. And all the days of the life of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years--until the thirty-first year of the life of Levi--and he died in the one hundred and twentieth year of the life of Jacob. Twenty-three years after Jacob went up from <U>H</U>arr&acirc;n, Joseph was sold to the Midianites; he was sold during the lifetime of Isaac, and they mourned for him.

And Judah gave T&acirc;m&acirc;r to &Ocirc;n&acirc;n, and as soon as his seed became available for T&acirc;m&acirc;r he wasted it, and him also did God put to death. Thus, God did not permit the seed of Canaan to mingle with the seed of Jacob, even as Jacob prayed God that the seed of Canaan, the firstborn of the lascivious Ham, might not be mingled among the generations [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_29a2"></A>Fol. 29<I>a</I>, col. 2</FONT>] of the Fathers.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there are certain doctors who trace the genealogies of the Tribes from the death of Jacob, and who mix them together, but they do not do this in the light of knowledge.

Now fix thine attention on these generations, and how they became mixed together. [When] they went forth from Egypt: Judah begot Pharez, Pharez begot <U>H</U>e<U>s</U>r&ocirc;n (Hezron), Hezron begot &Acirc;r&acirc;m (R&acirc;m, <A HREF="../../bib/kjv/ch1.htm#2:9">1 Chron. ii. 9</A>), &Acirc;r&acirc;m begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Na<U>h</U>sh&ocirc;n (Nahson), and Na<U>h</U>sh&ocirc;n was he who became prince of Judah. And Amminadab gave the sister of Na<U>h</U>sh&ocirc;n to `&Icirc;r (so in the text, but read Eleazar), the son of Aaron, the priest; of her was born Phinehas, the great priest, who prayed "and the plague was stayed" (<A HREF="../../bib/kjv/num.htm#25:7">Num. xxv. 7</A>, 8; <A HREF="../../bib/kjv/psa.htm#106:30">Ps. cvi. 30</A>). Behold, I have shown thee that from Amminadab, the priesthood of the children of Israel was transmitted by the sister of Na<U>h</U>sh&ocirc;n, and the kingdom by Na<U>h</U>sh&ocirc;n her brother. Observe also that the priesthood and the kingdom were transmitted by Judah to the children of Israel.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Na<U>h</U>sh&ocirc;n begot Sh&icirc;l&acirc;, that is to say, Salm&ocirc;n, and Sh&icirc;l&acirc; begot Boaz. Observe now

that the kingdom went forth from Boaz and Ruth [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_29b2"></A>Fol. 29<I>b</I>, col. 2</FONT>], the Moabitess, for the old man Boaz took Ruth to wife so that Lot, the son of Abraham's brother, might have participation in the transmission of the kingdom. And God did not deprive the righteous man Lot of the reward of his labour, because he had suffered in exile with Abraham, and he received the angels of God in peace. And that the righteous man Lot might not be reviled because he slept with his daughters, God granted that the royal succession might be maintained by the seed of both, and that Christ should be born of the seed of Lot and Abraham. And from the seed of Ruth, the Moabitess, Obed was born, and from Obed, Jesse, and from Jesse, David, and from David, Solomon; these are the descendants of Ruth, the Moabitess, the daughter of Lot. And of Na`m&acirc; (Naamah, <A HREF="../../bib/kjv/kg1.htm#14:21">1 Kings xiv. 21</A>), the Ammonitess, another daughter of Lot, whom Solomon took to wife [<FONT COLOR=GREEN><A NAME="fol_30a1"></A>Fol. 30<I>a</I>, col. 1</FONT>], was born Rehoboam, who reigned after Solomon.</P>
