<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extracts quoted in the preceding pages show how largely Solomon, Bishop of Al-Ba<U>s</U>rah, borrowed from the "Cave of Treasures" when compiling his work, "The Book of the Bee," especially when he was dealing with the history of the early Patriarchs. But he did not bring his book to a close with the narrative of the Crucifixion, for his aim was to describe briefly the progress of Christianity after the death of Christ; and in doing this he collected and set down in writing a considerable amount of information regarding the Apostles and disciples, and their lives and deaths, and a number of facts and legends which he accepted and wished the

Nestorians in his diocese especially to believe. In fact, the "Book of the Bee," though written by a Nestorian bishop, may be regarded as a supplement or continuation of the "Cave of Treasures," which, according to ancient tradition, was written by a Jacobite bishop. Both works are included in the collection of texts which the learned priest H&ocirc;m&ocirc; copied in the British Museum MS. Add. 25875, and both were so highly esteemed that copies of them were made for the library of the church of the Virgin Mary in `Amed&icirc;a. The following summary is based on my translation of the Syriac text published at Oxford in 1886.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[THE DEATH AND ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN MARY.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary lived twelve years after our Lord's Ascension; the sum of the years which she lived in the world was fifty-eight years, but others say sixty-one years. She was not buried on earth, but the angels carried her to Paradise, and angels bore her bier. On the other hand, we read in the <I>History of the Virgin</I>, "And the blessed Mary departed this life in the year of Alexander, 394 (<I>i.e.</I> <SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> 82-83). At the Annunciation she was thirty years old, and she lived also the thirty-three years of the Dispensation; and after the Crucifixion she lived fifty-eight

years. The years which she lived were one hundred and twenty-one." In the same book we have: "And Mary remained in Jerusalem, and grieved because of her separation from our Lord Jesus Christ, and the absence of the apostles from her. And she prayed and cast frankincense into the fire, and lifted up her eyes and spread out her hands to heaven, and said, 'O Christ, the Son of the living God, hearken unto the voice of Thy handmaiden, and send unto me Thy friend John the Young with his fellow-apostles, that I may see them and be comforted by the sight of them before the day of my death; and I will praise and adore Thy goodness.'" And straightway it was revealed by the Holy Spirit to each one of the apostles, in whatever country he was in, that the blessed Mary was about to depart from this world into the never-ending life. And the Spirit summoned them, along with those of them who were dead, to be gathered together at daybreak to the blessed Mary for her to see them: and each one of them came to her from his own land at dawn by the agency of the Holy Spirit, and they saluted Mary and each other, and adored her. Thomas was in India, and an angel took him up and brought him. And he found the angels carrying her bier through the air; and they brought it nigh to Thomas, and he also prayed and was blessed by her.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[THE LAST SUPPER.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some men have a tradition that when our Lord broke His body in the Upper Chamber, John, the son of Zebedee, hid a part of his portion until our Lord rose from the dead. When Thomas put his finger near to our Lord's side, and it rested on the mark of the spear, the disciples saw the blood. And John took that piece of consecrated bread, and wiped up that blood with it; and the Easterns M&acirc;r Addai and M&acirc;r M&acirc;r&icirc; took that piece, and sanctified this

<!------------------------page 253------------------------>

<A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A>

unleavened bread which has been handed down among us. Others say that when John took that piece of consecrated bread in his hand, it burst into flame, and burnt in the palm of his hand, and the palm of his hand sweated, and he took that sweat and hid it for the sign of the Cross of baptism.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[THE APOSTLES.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apostles were Twelve and Seventy; their names are:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S<SMALL>IMON</SMALL>, the chief of the Apostles, was from Bethsaida, of the tribe of Naphtali. He preached for one year in Antioch, where the disciples were [first] called Christians, and he built there the first church, in the house of Cassianus, whose son he restored to life. He lived in Rome twenty-seven years. He was crucified, head downwards, by Nero, in the 376th year of the Greeks (65-64 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL>).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A<SMALL>NDREW</SMALL>, his brother, preached in Scythia, Nicomedia, and Achaia. He died in Byzantium and was buried in the church which he built there.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J<SMALL>OHN</SMALL>, the son of Zabhdai (Zebedee), was from Bethsaida, of the tribe of Zebulon. He preached in Ephesus, was exiled to Patmos, and then returned to Ephesus, where he built a church. Three of his disciples went with him:--I<SMALL>GNATIUS</SMALL>,

<!------------------------page 254------------------------>

<A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A>

later bishop of Antioch, who was thrown to the beasts in Rome; P<SMALL>OLYCARP</SMALL>, later bishop of Smyrna who was burnt to death; and J<SMALL>OHN</SMALL>, who succeeded him as bishop. John, the son of Zebedee, was buried by John, his disciple, at Ephesus, and his grave is unknown. John, his disciple, was also buried at Ephesus. He wrote the Revelation, and said that all he had written in that book he had received from John the Evangelist.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J<SMALL>AMES</SMALL>, the brother of John, preached in Bethsaida and built a church there. Herod Agrippa slew him with the sword in the year following the Ascension of our Lord. He was buried at &Acirc;<U>k</U>&acirc;r, a city of Marm&acirc;r&icirc;<U>k</U>&acirc;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P<SMALL>HILIP</SMALL>, from Bethsaida, was of the tribe of Asher. He preached in Phrygia, Pamphylia and Pisidia; he died in Pisidia, and was buried in the church which he built there. He lived as an apostle 27 years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T<SMALL>HOMAS</SMALL>, from Jerusalem, was of the tribe of Judah. He taught the Parthians, Medes and Indians; he baptized the daughter of the Indian king, who had him speared to death. <U>H</U>abb&acirc;n the merchant brought his body to Edessa and buried it there. Some say he was buried in Ma<U>h</U>l&ucirc;ph in India.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M<SMALL>ATTHEW</SMALL>, from Nazareth, was of the tribe of Issachar. He preached in Palestine, Tyre and

<!------------------------page 255------------------------>

<A NAME="page_255"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A>

Sidon, and went as far as Gabb&ucirc;l&acirc; (<I>i.e.</I> al-Jabb&acirc;l, a town in Coelesyria). He died, and was buried in Antioch.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B<SMALL>ARTHOLOMEW</SMALL>, from Endor, was of the tribe of Issachar. He preached in Armenia, Ardesh&icirc;r, <U>K</U>e<U>t</U>arb&ocirc;l, Radb&icirc;n and Pr&ucirc;harm&acirc;n. He first went to Golthon in Armenia, came back to Artaschu, and then went on to Her, Zarevant and Urbianos. He lived as an apostle for 30 years, and then H&ucirc;rs<U>t</U>&icirc; (Rh&ucirc;s<U>t</U>n&icirc; or H&ecirc;r&ocirc;s<U>t</U>m&icirc;), king of Armenia, crucified him in Urbianos. He was buried in the church which he had built in Armenia. The king of Armenia in the time of Bartholomew was called Sanadrog (Sanatruk).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J<SMALL>UDE</SMALL>, the son of James, surnamed T<SMALL>HADDAEUS</SMALL> (T<SMALL>ADDAI</SMALL>), who is also L<SMALL>EBBAEUS</SMALL> (Lebbai), from Jerusalem, was of the tribe of Judah. He preached in Laodicea, and in Antaradus and Arw&acirc;d (Ruw&acirc;d). He was stoned in Arw&acirc;d, and died and was buried there.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S<SMALL>IMON</SMALL> Z<SMALL>EL&Ocirc;TES</SMALL>, from Galilee, was of the tribe of Ephraim. He preached in Sh&ecirc;m&ecirc;sh&acirc;t (Samosata), P&acirc;r&icirc;n (Perrh&ecirc;), Zeugma, <U>H</U>&acirc;l&acirc;b (Aleppo), Mabb&ocirc;g (Manbig), and Kenneshr&icirc;n (<U>K</U>innesr&icirc;n). He built a church in Kyrrhos, and died and was buried there.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J<SMALL>AMES</SMALL>, the brother of our Lord, was cast down from a pinnacle of the Temple whilst preaching in Jerusalem; then a fuller of cloth smashed in his skull with a club, and afterwards they stoned him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J<SMALL>OHN THE</SMALL> B<SMALL>APTIST</SMALL> was of the tribe of Levi. Herod the tetrarch slew him, and his body was buried in Sebastia.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A<SMALL>NANIAS</SMALL> (<U>H</U><SMALL>ANANY&Acirc;</SMALL>), John's disciple, taught in Damascus and Arb&icirc;l. P&ocirc;l, the general of Aretas (Aristus) slew him, and he was buried in his church at Arbil.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P<SMALL>AUL</SMALL>, of Tarsus, was a Pharisee and of the tribe of Ephraim (or, Benjamin ?). He went to Peter at Rome, and Nero ordered them to be slain. On their way to the place of slaughter they gave the laying on of hands of the priesthood to their disciples, Peter to Mark, and Paul to Luke. Peter was crucified and Paul was beheaded, and Mark and Luke brought their

<A NAME="page_257"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 257</FONT></A>

bodies into the city. But Paul's head could not be found. At length a shepherd found it, and he laid it by his sheep-fold. At night a fire blazed over it, and the shepherd went and told bishop Xystus and the clergy, and when they saw the head they recognized it as Paul's head. They laid the head at the feet of Paul's body, and, having prayed the whole night, the head was found to have joined itself to the body. From his call to the end of his life was 35 years; he travelled for 31 years, and he was in prison at Caesarea for two years, and for two years in Rome. He was martyred in the thirty-sixth year after the Passion of our Lord, and was buried in the royal catacombs in Rome.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M<SMALL>ARK</SMALL> the Evangelist preached in Rome, and died and was buried there. He was either the son of Simon Peter's wife or the son of Simon; and Rhoda was his sister. He was first called John, but the Apostles changed his name to Mark.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A<SMALL>DDAI</SMALL>, from Paneas, preached in Edessa and Mesopotamia in the days of Abhgar the king; he

<!------------------------page 258------------------------>

<A NAME="page_258"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A>

built a church in Edessa. Herod, son of Abhgar, slew him in the fortress of Agg&ecirc;l, or Eng&icirc;l, north of Amid. He was buried either in Edessa or Rome.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A<SMALL>GGAI</SMALL>, the disciple of Addai, was a silk weaver; because he refused to give up his preaching, Herod, son of Abhgar, broke his legs with a club and he killed him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S<SMALL>TEPHEN</SMALL> was stoned to death in Jerusalem, and was buried in Kephar Gaml&acirc;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know, O my brother readers, that from the beginning of the creation of Adam to Alexander was 5180 years.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[OF GOG AND MAGOG.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Alexander was king, and had subdued countries and cities, and had arrived in the East, he saw in the confines of the East those men who are of the children of Japhet. They were more wicked and unclean than all [other] dwellers in the world; filthy people of hideous appearance, who ate mice and the creeping things of the earth, and snakes and scorpions. They never buried the bodies of their dead [but ate them]. People ignorant of God, and unacquainted with the power of reason, but who lived in this world without understanding like ravening beasts. When Alexander saw their wickedness, he called God to his aid, and he gathered together and brought them and their wives and children, and made them go in, and

<!------------------------page 266------------------------>

<A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A>

shut them up within the confines of the North. This is the gate of the world on the north, and there is no other entrance or exit from the confines of the world from the east to the north. And Alexander prayed to God with tears, and God heard his prayer and commanded those two lofty mountains which are called "the children of the north," and they drew nigh to one another until there remained between them about twelve cubits. Then he built in front of them a strong building, and he made for it a door of brass, and anointed it within and without with oil of Thesna<U>k</U>t&icirc;s (<I>i.e.</I> an oil which cannot be burnt off with fire or scraped off with an iron tool), so that if they should bring iron implements near it to force it to open, they would be unable to move it; and if they wished to melt it with fire, it would quench it; and it feared neither the operations of devils nor of sorcerers, and was not to be overcome [by them]. Now there were twenty-two kingdoms imprisoned within the northern gate, and their names are these:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G&ocirc;g, M&acirc;g&ocirc;g.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N&acirc;w&acirc;l, Eshk<U>e</U>n&acirc;z (Eshk&icirc;n).<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the world and at the final consummation, when men are eating and drinking and marrying wives; and women are given to husbands; when they are planting vineyards and building buildings, and there is neither wicked man nor adversary, on account of the assured tranquillity and certain peace; suddenly the gates of the north shall be opened, and the hosts of the nations that are imprisoned there shall go forth. The whole earth shall tremble before them, and men shall flee and take refuge in the mountains and in caves and in burial places, and in clefts of the earth; and they shall die of hunger, and there will be none to bury them, by reason of the multitude of afflictions which they will make men suffer. They will eat dead dogs and cats; they will give mothers the bodies of their children to cook, and they will eat them before them without shame. They will destroy the earth, and there will be none able to stand before them. After one week of

<!------------------------page 268------------------------>

<A NAME="page_268"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 268</FONT></A>

that sore affliction, they will all be destroyed in the plain of Joppa, for thither will all those [people] be gathered together, with their wives and their sons and their daughters.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">[OF THE COMING OF ANTI-CHRIST.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a week and half a week after the destruction of these wretches shall the son of destruction appear. He shall be conceived in Chorazin, born in Bethsaida, and reared in Capernaum. Chorazin shall exult because he was conceived in her, Bethsaida because he was born in her, and Capernaum because he was brought up in her; for this reason our Lord proclaimed Woe to these three [cities] in the Gospel (<A HREF="../../bib/kjv/mat.htm#11:21">Matt. xi. 21</A>). As soon as the son of perdition is revealed the king of the Greeks will go up and stand upon Golgotha, where our Lord was crucified; and he will set the royal crown upon the top of the holy Cross, upon which our Lord was crucified; and he will stretch out his two hands to heaven, and will deliver over the kingdom to God the Father. The holy Cross shall be taken up to heaven, and the royal crown with it; and the king will die immediately. The king who shall deliver over the kingdom to God will be descended from the seed of K&ucirc;shath, the daughter of P&icirc;l, the king of the Ethiopians; for Armelaus (Romulus), the king of the Greeks, took K&ucirc;shath to

<!------------------------page 269------------------------>

<A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A>

wife, and the seed of the Ethiopians was mingled with that of the Greeks. From this seed shall a king arise who shall deliver the kingdom over to God, as the blessed David hath said, "Cush will deliver the power to God" (<A HREF="../../bib/kjv/psa.htm#68:31">Ps. lxviii. 31</A>).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Cross is raised up to heaven straightway shall every head and every ruler and all powers be brought to nought, and God will withdraw His providential care from the earth. The heavens will be prevented from letting fall rain, and the earth from producing germs and plants; and the earth shall remain like iron through drought, and the heavens like brass. Then will the son of perdition appear, of the seed and of the tribe of Dan; and he will show deluding phantasms, and lead astray the world, for the simple will see the lepers cleansed, the blind with their eyes opened, the paralytic walking, the devils cast out, the sun when he looks upon it becoming black, the moon when he commands it becoming changed, the trees putting forth fruit from their branches, and the earth making roots to grow. He will show deluding phantasms [of this kind], but he will not be able to raise the dead. He will go into Jerusalem and will sit upon a throne in the Temple, saying, "I am the Christ," and he will be borne aloft by legions of devils like a king and a lawgiver, naming himself God, and

<!------------------------page 270------------------------>

<A NAME="page_270"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 270</FONT></A>

saying, "I am the fulfilment of the types and the parables." He will put an end to prayers and offerings, as if at his appearance prayers are to be abolished and men will not need sacrifices and offerings along with him. He becomes a man incarnate by a married woman of the tribe of Dan. When this son of destruction becomes a man, he will be made a dwelling place for devils, and all Satanic workings will be perfected in him. There will be gathered together with him all the devils and all the hosts of the Indians; and before all the Indians and before all men will the mad Jewish nation believe in him, saying, "This is the Christ, the expectation of the world." The time of the error of the Anti-christ will last two years and a half, but others say three years and six months. And when everyone is standing in despair, then will Elijah (Elias) come from Paradise, and convict the deceiver, and turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers; and he will encourage and strengthen the hearts of the believers.</P>
