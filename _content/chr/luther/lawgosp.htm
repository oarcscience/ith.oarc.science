    <P>Second Corinthians 3:4-11. 4 And such confidence have we through Christ 
    to Godward: 5 not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything 
    as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God; 6 who also made us 
    sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the 
    spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. 7 But if the 
    ministration of death, written, and engraven on stones, came with glory, so 
    that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses 
    for the glory of his face; which glory was passing away: 8 how shall not 
    rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory? 9 For if the 
    ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration 
    of righteousness exceed in glory. 10 For verily that which hath been made 
    glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory 
    that surpasseth. 11 For if that which passeth away was with glory, much more 
    that which remaineth is in glory.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>1. This epistle lesson sounds altogether strange and wonderful to individuals 
unaccustomed to Scripture language, particularly to that of Paul. To the 
inexperienced ear and heart it is not intelligible. In popedom thus far it has 
remained quite unapprehended, although reading of the words has been 
practiced.</P>
<P>2. That we may understand it, we must first get an idea of Paul's theme. 
Briefly, he would oppose the vain boasting of false apostles and preachers 
concerning their possession of</P>

<P><FONT color=#731b31 size=-1><BR></FONT>the spirit and their peculiar skill 
and gifts, by praising and glorifying the office of a preacher of the Gospel 
with which he is intrusted. For he found that, especially in the Church at 
Corinth, which he had converted by the words of his own lips and brought to 
faith in Christ, soon after his departure the devil introduced his heresies 
whereby the people were turned from the truth and betrayed into other ways. 
Since it became his duty to make an attack upon such heresies, he devoted both 
his epistles to the purpose of keeping the Corinthians in the right way, so that 
they might retain the pure doctrine received from him, and beware of false 
spirits. The main thing which moved him to write this second epistle was his 
desire to emphasize to them his apostolic office of a preacher of the Gospel, in 
order to put to shame the glory of those other teachers--the glory they boasted 
with many words and great pretense.</P>
<P>3. He starts in on this theme just before he reaches our text. And this is 
how it is he comes to speak in high terms of praise of the ministration of the 
Gospel and to contrast and compare the twofold ministration or message which may 
be proclaimed in the Church, provided, of course, that God's Word is to be 
preached and not the nonsense of human falsehood and the doctrine of the devil. 
One is that of the Old Testament, the other of the New; in other words, the 
office of Moses, or the Law, and the office of the Gospel of Christ. He 
contrasts the glory and power of the latter with those of the former, which, it 
is true, is also the Word of God. In this manner he endeavors to defeat the 
teachings and pretensions of those seductive spirits who, as he but lately 
foretold, pervert God&quot;s Word, in that they greatly extol the Law of God, 
yet at best do not teach its right use, but, instead of making it tributary to 
faith in Christ, misuse it to teach work-righteousness.</P>
<P>4. Since the words before us are in reality a continuation of those with 
which the chapter opens, the latter must be considered in this connection. We 
read:</P>
<P>&quot;Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, 
epistles of commendation to you</P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE

<P></P>
<P>or from you? Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all 
men; being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, 
written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of 
stone, but in tables that are hearts of flesh.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We, my fellow-apostles and co-laborers and I,&quot; he says, &quot;do 
not ask for letters and seals from others commending us to you, or from you 
commending us to others, in order to seduce people after gaining their good will 
in your church and in others as well. Such is the practice of the false 
apostles, and many even now present letters and certificates from honest 
preachers and Churches, and make them the means whereby their unrighteous 
plotting may be received in good faith. Such letters, thank God, we stand not in 
need of, and you need not fear we shall use such means of deception. For you are 
yourselves the letter we have written and wherein we may pride ourselves and 
which we present everywhere. For it is a matter of common knowledge that you 
have been taught by us, and brought to Christ through our ministry.&quot;</P>
<P><BR><FONT color=#232f85>PAUL'S CONVERTS LIVING EPISTLES</FONT></P>
<P>5. Inasmuch as his activity among them is his testimonial, and they 
themselves are aware that through his ministerial office he has constituted them 
a church, he calls them an epistle written by himself; not with ink and in 
paragraphs, not on paper or wood, nor engraved upon hard rock as the Ten 
Commandments written upon tables of stone, which Moses placed before the people, 
but written by the Holy Spirit upon fleshly tables--hearts of tender flesh. The 
Spirit is the ink or the inscription, yes, even the writer himself; but the 
pencil or pen and the hand of the writer is the ministry of Paul.</P>
<P>6. This figure of a written epistle is, however, in accord with Scripture 
usage. Moses commands (Deut 6:6-9; 11, 18) that the Israelites write the Ten 
Commandments in all places where they walked or stood upon the posts of their 
houses, and upon their gates, and ever have them before their eyes and in their 
hearts. Again (Prov 7:2-3), Solomon<BR></P>

<P></P>
<P>says: &quot;Keep my commandments and...my law as the apple of thine eye. Bind 
them upon thy fingers; write them upon the tablet of thy heart.&quot; He speaks 
as a father to his child when giving the child an earnest charge to remember a 
certain thing--&quot;Dear child, remember this; forget it not; keep it in thy 
heart.&quot; Likewise, God says in the book of Jeremiah the prophet (ch. 31, 
33), &quot;I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I 
write it.&quot; Here man's heart is represented as a sheet, or slate, or page, 
whereon is written the preached Word; for the heart is to receive and securely 
keep the Word. In this sense Paul says: &quot;We have, by our ministry, written 
a booklet or letter upon your heart, which witnesses that you believe in God the 
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and have the assurance that through Christ you are 
redeemed and saved. This testimony is what is written on your heart. The letters 
are not characters traced with ink or crayon, but the living thoughts, the fire 
and force of the heart.</P>
<P>7. Note further, that it is his ministry to which Paul ascribes the 
preparation of their heart thereon and the inscription which constitutes them 
&quot;living epistles of Christ.&quot; He contrasts his ministry with the blind 
fancies of those fanatics who seek to receive, and dream of having, the Holy 
Spirit without the oral word; who, perchance, creep into a corner and grasp the 
Spirit through dreams, directing the people away from the preached Word and 
visible ministry. But Paul says that the Spirit, through his preaching, has 
wrought in the hearts of his Corinthians, to the end that Christ lives and is 
mighty in them. After such statement he bursts into praise of the ministerial 
office, comparing the message, or preaching, of Moses with that of himself and 
the apostles. He says:</P>
<P>&quot;Such confidence have we through Christ to Godward: not that we are 
sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our 
sufficiency is from God</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#232f85>TRUE PREACHERS COMMISSIONED BY GOD</FONT></P>
<P>8. These words are blows and thrusts for the false apostles<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>and preachers. Paul is mortal enemy to the blockheads who make great boast, 
pretending to what they do not possess and to what they cannot do; who boast of 
having the Spirit in great measure; who are ready to counsel and aid the whole 
world; who pride themselves on the ability to invent something new. It is to be 
a surpassingly precious and heavenly thing they are to spin out of their heads, 
as the dreams of pope and monks have been in time past.</P>
<P>&quot;We do not so,&quot; says Paul. &quot;We rely not upon ourselves or our 
wisdom and ability. We preach not what we have ourselves invented. But this is 
our boast and trust in Christ before God, that we have made of you a divine 
epistle; have written upon your hearts, not our thoughts, but the Word of God. 
We are not, however, glorifying our own power, but the works and the power of 
him who has called and equipped us for such an office; from whom proceeds all 
you have heard and believed.</P>
<P>9. It is a glory which every preacher may claim, to be able to say with full 
confidence of heart: &quot;This trust have I toward God in Christ, that what I 
teach and preach is truly the Word of God.&quot; Likewise, when he performs 
other official duties in the Church--baptizes a child, absolves and comforts a 
sinner--it must be done in the same firm conviction that such is the command of 
Christ.</P>
<P>10. He who would teach and exercise authority in the Church without this 
glory, &quot;it is profitable for him,&quot; as Christ says (Mt. 18:6), 
&quot;that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should 
be sunk in the depths of the sea.&quot; For the devil's lies he preaches, and 
death is what he effects. Our Papists, in time past, after much and 
long-continued teaching, after many inventions and works whereby they hoped to 
be saved, nevertheless always doubted in heart and mind whether or no they had 
pleased God. The teaching and works of all heretics and seditious spirits 
certainly do not bespeak for them trust in Christ; their own glory is the object 
of their teaching, and the homage and praise of the people is the goal of their 
desire.<BR></P>

<P></P>
<P>&quot;Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from 
ourselves.&quot;</P>
<P>11. As said before, this is spoken in denunciation of the false spirits who 
believe that by reason of eminent equipment of special creation and election, 
they are called to come to the rescue of the people, expecting wonders from 
whatever they say and do.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#232f85>HUMAN DOCTRINE NO PLACE IN THE CHURCH</FONT></P>
<P>12. Now, we know ourselves to be of the same clay whereof they are made; 
indeed, we perhaps have the greater call from God: yet we cannot boast of being 
capable of ourselves to advise or aid men. We cannot even originate an idea 
calculated to give help. And when it comes to the knowledge of how one may stand 
before God and attain to eternal life, that is truly not to be achieved by our 
work or power, nor to originate in our brain. In other things, those pertaining 
to this temporal life, you may glory in what You know, you may advance the 
teachings of reason, you may invent ideas of your own; for example: how to make 
shoes or clothes, how to govern a household, how to manage a herd. In such 
things exercise your mind to the best of your ability. Cloth or leather of this 
sort will permit itself to be stretched and cut according to the good pleasure 
of the tailor or shoemaker. But in spiritual matters, human reasoning certainly 
is not in order; other intelligence, other skill and power, are requisite 
here--something to be granted by God himself and revealed through his Word.</P>
<P>13. What mortal has ever discovered or fathomed the truth that the three 
persons in the eternal divine essence are one God; that the second person, the 
Son of God, was obliged to become man, born of a virgin; and that no way of life 
could be opened for us, save through his crucifixion? Such truth never would 
have been heard nor preached, would never in all eternity have been published, 
learned and believed, had not God himself revealed it.</P>
<P>14. For this season they are blind fools of first magnitude and dangerous 
characters who would boast of their grand performances, and think that the 
people are served when they<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE 
229<BR></FONT>
<P></P>
<P>preach their own fancies and inventions. It has been the practice in the 
Church for anyone to introduce any teaching he saw fit; for example, the monks 
and priests have daily produced new saints, pilgrimages, special prayers, works 
and sacrifices in the effort to blot out sin, redeem souls from purgatory, and 
so on. They who make up things of this kind are not such as put their trust in 
God through Christ, but rather such as defy God and Christ. Into the hearts of 
men, where Christ alone should be, they shove the filth and write the lies of 
the devil. Yet they think themselves, and themselves only, qualified for all 
essential teaching and work, self-grown doctors that they are, saints 
all-powerful without the help of God and Christ.</P>
<P>&quot;But our sufficiency is from God.&quot;</P>
<P>15. Of ourselves--in our own wisdom and strength--we cannot effect, discover 
nor teach any counsel or help for man, whether for ourselves or others. Any good 
work we perform among you, any doctrine we write upon your heart that is God's 
own work. He puts into our heart and mouth what we should say, and impresses it 
upon your heart through the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we cannot ascribe to 
ourselves any honor therein, cannot seek our own glory as the self-instructed 
and proud spirits do; we must give to God alone the honor, and must glory in the 
fact that by his grace and power he works in you unto Salvation, through the 
office committed unto us.</P>
<P>16. Now, Paul's thought here is that nothing should be taught and practiced 
in the Church but what is unquestionably God's Word. It will not do to introduce 
or perform anything whatever upon the strength of man's judgment. Man's 
achievements, man's reasoning and power, are of no avail save in so far as they 
come from God. As Peter says in his first epistle (ch. 4:11): &quot;If any man 
speaketh, speaking as it were oracles of God; if any man ministereth, 
ministering as of the strength which God supplieth.&quot; In short, let him who 
would be wise, who would boast of great skill, talents and power, confine 
himself to things other than spiritual; with respect to spiritual matters, let 
him keep his place and<BR></P>

<P></P>
<P>refrain from boasting and pretense. For it is of no moment that men observe 
your greatness and ability; the important thing is that poor souls may rest 
assured of being presented with God's Word and works, whereby they may be 
saved.</P>
<P>&quot;Who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the 
letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth 
life.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#232f85>THE NEW COVENANT</FONT></P>
<P>17. Paul here proceeds to exalt the office and power of the Gospel over the 
glorying of the false apostles, and to elevate the power of the Word above that 
of all other doctrine, even of the Law of God. Truly we are not sufficient of 
ourselves and have nothing to boast of so far as human activity is considered. 
For that is without merit or power, however strenuous the effort may be to 
fulfil God's Law. We have, however, something infinitely better to boast of, 
something not grounded in our own activity: by God we have been made sufficient 
for a noble ministry, termed the ministry &quot;of a New Covenant.&quot; This 
ministry is not only exalted far above any teaching to be evolved by human 
wisdom, skill and power, but is more glorious than the ministry termed the 
&quot;Old Covenant,&quot; which in time past was delivered to the Jews through 
Moses. While this ministry clings, in common with other doctrine, to the Word 
given by revelation, it is the agency whereby the Holy Spirit works in the 
heart. Therefore, Paul says it is not a ministration of the letter, but 
&quot;&quot;of the spirit.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#232f85>&quot;SPIRIT&quot; &amp; &quot;LETTER&quot;</FONT></P>
<P>18. This passage relative to spirit and letter has in the past been wholly 
strange language to us. Indeed, to such extent has man's nonsensical 
interpretation perverted and weakened it that I, through a learned doctor of the 
holy Scriptures, failed to understand it altogether, and I could find no one to 
teach me. And to this day it is unintelligible to all popedom. In fact, even the 
old teachers--Origen, Jerome and others--have not caught Paul's thought. And no 
wonder, truly! For it is essentially a doctrine far beyond the power of man's 
intelligence to comprehend. When human<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE 
231</FONT><BR>
<P></P>
<P>reason meddles with it, it becomes perplexed. The doctrine is wholly 
unintelligible to it, for human thought goes no farther than the Law and the Ten 
Commandments. Laying hold upon these it confines itself to them. It does not 
attempt to do more, being governed by the principle that unto him who fulfils 
the demands of the Law, or commandments, God is gracious. Reason knows nothing 
about the wretchedness of depraved nature. It does not recognize the fact that 
no man is able to keep God's commandments; that all are under sin and 
condemnation; and that the only way whereby help could be received was for God 
to give his Son for the world, ordaining another ministration, one through which 
grace and reconciliation might be proclaimed to us. Now, he who does not 
understand the sublime subject of which Paul speaks cannot but miss the true 
meaning of his words. How much more did we invite this fate when we threw the 
Scriptures and Saint Paul's epistles under the bench, and, like swine in husks, 
wallowed in man's nonsense! Therefore, we must submit to correction and learn to 
understand the apostle's utterance aright.</P>
<P>19. &quot;Letter&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; have been understood to mean, 
according to Origen and Jerome, the obvious sense of the written word. St. 
Augustine, it must be admitted, has gotten an inkling of the truth. Now, the 
position of the former teachers would perhaps not be quite incorrect did they 
correctly explain the words. By &quot;literary sense&quot; they signify the 
meaning of a Scripture narrative according to the ordinary interpretation of the 
words. By &quot;spiritual sense&quot; they signify the secondary, hidden sense 
found in the words.</P>
<P>For instance: The Scripture narrative in Genesis third records how the 
serpent persuaded the woman to eat of the forbidden fruit and to give to her 
husband, who also ate. This narrative in its simplest meaning represents what 
they understand by &quot;letter.&quot; &quot;Spirit,&quot; however, they 
understand to mean the spiritual interpretation, which is thus: The serpent 
signifies the evil temptation which lures to sin. The woman represents the 
sensual state, or the sphere in which such enticements and temptations make 
themselves<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE

<P></P>
<P>felt. Adam, the man, stands for reason, which is called man's highest 
endowment. Now, when reason does not yield to the allurements of external sense, 
all is well; but when it permits itself to waver and consent, the fall has taken 
place.</P>
<P>20. Origen was the first to trifle thus with the holy Scriptures, and many 
others followed, until now it is thought to be the sign of great cleverness for 
the Church to be filled with such quibblings. The aim is to imitate Paul, who 
(Gal 4;22-24) figuratively interprets the story of Abraham's two sons, the one 
by the free woman, or the mistress of the house, and the other by the hand-maid. 
The two women, Paul says, represent the two covenants: one covenant makes only 
bondservants, which is just what he in our text terms the ministration of the 
letter; the other leads to liberty, or, as he says here, the ministration of the 
spirit, which gives life. And the two sons are the two peoples, one of which 
does not go farther than the Law, while the other accepts in faith the 
Gospel.</P>
<P>True, this is an interpretation not directly suggested by the narrative and 
the text. Paul himself calls it an allegory; that is, a mystic narrative, or a 
story with a hidden meaning. But he does not say that the literal text is 
necessarily the letter that killeth, and the allegory, or hidden meaning, the 
spirit. But the false teachers assert of all Scripture that the text, or record 
itself, is but a dead &quot;letter,&quot; its interpretation being &quot;the 
spirit.&quot; Yet they have not pushed interpretation farther than the teaching 
of the Law; and it is precisely the Law which Paul means when he speaks of 
&quot;the letter.&quot;</P>
<P>21. Paul employs the word &quot;letter&quot; in such contemptuous sense in 
reference to the Law--though the Law is, nevertheless, the Word of God--when he 
compares it with the ministry of the Gospel. The letter is to him the doctrine 
of<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE 
233<BR></FONT>
<P></P>
<P>the Ten Commandments, which teach how we should obey God, honor parents, love 
our neighbor, and so on--the very best doctrine to be found in all books, 
sermons and schools.</P>
<P>The word &quot;letter&quot; is to the apostle Paul everything which may take 
the form of doctrine, of literary arrangement, of record, so long as it remains 
something spoken or written. Also thoughts which may be pictured or expressed by 
word or writing, but it is not that which is written in the heart, to become its 
life. &quot;Letter&quot; is the whole Law of Moses, or the Ten Commandments, 
though the supreme authority of such teaching is not denied. It matters not 
whether you hear them, read them, or reproduce them mentally. For instance, when 
I sit down to meditate upon the first commandment: &quot;Thou shalt have no 
other gods before me,&quot; or the second, or the third, and so forth, I have 
something which I can read, write, discuss, and aim to fulfil with all my might. 
The process is quite similar when the emperor or prince gives a command and 
says: &quot;This you shall do, that you shall eschew.&quot; This is what the 
apostle calls &quot;the letter,&quot; or, as we have called it on another 
occasion, the written sense.</P>
<P>22. Now, as opposed to &quot;the letter,&quot; there is another doctrine or 
message, which he terms the &quot;ministration of a New Covenant&quot; and 
&quot;of the Spirit.&quot; This doctrine does not teach what works are required 
of man, for that man has already heard; but it makes known to him what God would 
do for him and bestow upon him, indeed what he has already done: he has given 
his Son Christ for us; because, for our disobedience to the Law, which no man 
fulfils, we were under God's wrath and condemnation. Christ made satisfaction 
for our sins, effected a reconciliation with God and gave to us his own 
righteousness. Nothing is said in this ministration of man's deeds; it tells 
rather of the works of Christ, who is unique in that he was born of a virgin, 
died for sin and rose from the dead, something no other man has been able to do. 
This doctrine is revealed through none but the Holy Spirit, and none other 
confers the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit works in the hearts of them who hear 
and<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE 
234<BR></FONT>
<P></P>
<P>accept the doctrine. Therefore, this ministration is termed a ministration 
&quot;of the Spirit.&quot;</P>
<P>23. The apostle employs the words &quot;letter&quot; and &quot;spirit,&quot; 
to contrast the two doctrines; to emphasize his office and show its advantage 
over all others, however eminent the teachers whom they boast, and however great 
the spiritual unction which they vaunt. It is of design that he does not term 
the two dispensations &quot;Law&quot; and &quot;Gospel,&quot; but names them 
according to the respective effects produced. He honors the Gospel with a 
superior term--&quot;ministration of the spirit.&quot; Of the Law, on the 
contrary, he speaks almost contemptuously, as if he would not honor it with the 
title of God's commandment, which in reality it is, according to his own 
admission later on that its deliverance to Moses and its injunction upon the 
children of Israel was an occasion of surpassing glory.</P>
<P>24. Why does Paul choose this method? Is it right for one to despise or 
dishonor God's Law? Is not a chaste and honorable life a matter of beauty and 
godliness? Such facts, it may be contended, are implanted by God in reason 
itself, and all books teach them; they are the governing force in the world. I 
reply: Paul's chief concern is to defeat the vainglory and pretensions of false 
preachers, and to teach them the right conception and appreciation of the Gospel 
which he proclaimed. What Paul means is this: When the Jews vaunt their Law of 
Moses, which was received as Law from God and recorded upon two tables of stone; 
when they vaunt their learned and saintly preachers of the Law and its 
exponents, and hold their deeds and manner of life up to admiration, what is all 
that compared to the Gospel message? The claim may be well made: a fine sermon, 
a splendid exposition; but, after all, nothing more comes of it than precepts, 
expositions, written comments. The precept, &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy 
God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself,&quot; remains a mere array 
of words. When much time and effort have been spent in conforming one's life to 
it, nothing has been accomplished. You have pods without peas, husks without 
kernels.<BR></P>

<P></P>
<P>25. For it is impossible to keep the Law without Christ, though man may, for 
the sake of honor or property, or from fear of punishment, feign outward 
holiness. The heart which does not discern God's grace in Christ cannot turn to 
God nor trust in him; it cannot love his commandments and delight in them, but 
rather resists them. For nature rebels at compulsion. No man likes to be a 
captive in chains. One does not voluntarily bow to the rod of punishment or 
submit to the executioner's sword; rather, because of these things, his anger 
against the Law is but increased, and he ever thinks: &quot;Would that I might 
unhindered steal, rob, hoard, gratify my lust, and so on!&quot; And when 
restrained by force, he would there were no Law and no God. And this is the case 
where conduct shows some effects of discipline, in that the outer man has been 
subjected to the teaching of the Law.</P>
<P>26. But in a far more appalling degree does inward rebellion ensue when the 
heart feels the full force of the Law; when, standing before God's judgment, it 
feels the sentence of condemnation; as we shall presently hear, for the apostle 
says &quot;the letter killeth.&quot; Then the truly hard knots appear. Human 
nature fumes and rages against the Law; offenses appear in the heart, the fruit 
of hate and enmity against the Law; and presently human nature flees before God 
and is incensed at God's judgment. It begins to question the equity of his 
dealings, to ask if he is a just God. Influenced by such thoughts, it falls ever 
deeper into doubt, it murmurs and chafes, until finally, unless the Gospel comes 
to the rescue, it utterly despairs, as did Judas, and Saul, and perhaps pass out 
of this life with God and creation. This is what Paul means when he says (Rom 
7:8-9) that the Law works sin in the heart of man, and sin works death, or 
kills.</P>
<P>27. You see, then, why the Law is called &quot;the letter&quot;: though noble 
doctrine, it remains on the surface; it does not enter the heart as a vital 
force which begets obedience. Such is the baseness of human nature, it will not 
and cannot conform to the Law; and so corrupt is mankind, there is no individual 
who does not violate all God's commandments in<BR></P>

<P>spite of daily hearing the preached Word and having held up to view God's 
wrath and eternal condemnation. Indeed, the harder pressed man is, the more 
furiously he storms against the Law.</P>
<P>28. The substance of the matter is this: When all the commandments have been 
put together, when their message receives every particle of praise to which it 
is entitled, it is still a mere letter. That is, teaching not put into practice. 
By &quot;letter&quot; is signified all manner of law, doctrine and message, 
which goes no farther than the oral or written word, which consists only of the 
powerless letter. To illustrate: A law promulgated by a prince or the 
authorities of a city, if not enforced, remains merely an open letter, which 
makes a demand indeed, but ineffectually. Similarly, God's Law, although a 
teaching of supreme authority and the eternal will of God, must suffer itself to 
become a mere empty letter or husk. Without a quickening heart, and devoid of 
fruit, the Law is powerless to effect life and salvation. It may well be called 
a veritable table of omissions (Lass-tafel); that is, it is a written 
enumeration, not of duties performed but of duties cast aside. In the languages 
of the world, it is a royal edict which remains unobserved and unperformed. In 
this light St. Augustine understood the Law. He says, commenting on Psalm 17, 
&quot;What is Law without grace but a letter without spirit?&quot; Human nature, 
without the aid of Christ and his grace, cannot keep it.</P>
<P>29. Again, Paul in terming the Gospel a &quot;ministration of the 
spirit&quot; would call attention to its power to produce in the hearts of men 
an effect wholly different from that of the Law: it is accompanied by the Holy 
Spirit and it creates a new heart. Man, driven into fear and anxiety by the 
preaching of the Law, hears this Gospel message, which, instead of reminding him 
of God's demands, tells him what God has done for him. It points not to man's 
works, but to the works of Christ, and bids him confidently believe that for the 
sake of his Son God will forgive his sins and accept him as his child. And this 
message, when received in faith, immediately cheers and comforts the heart. The 
heart will<BR></P>

<P>no longer flee from God; rather it turns to him. Finding grace with God and 
experiencing his mercy, the heart feels drawn to him. It commences to call upon 
him and to treat and revere him as its beloved God. In proportion as such faith 
and solace grow, also love for the commandments will grow and obedience to them 
will be man's delight. Therefore, God would have his Gospel message urged 
unceasingly as the means of awakening man's heart to discern his state and 
recall the great grace and lovingkindness of God, with the result that the power 
of the Holy Spirit is increased constantly. Note, no influence of the Law, no 
work of man is present here. The force is a new and heavenly one--the power of 
the Holy Spirit. He impresses upon the heart Christ and his works, making of it 
a true book which does not consist in the tracery of mere letters and words, but 
in true life and action.</P>
<P>30. God promised of old, in Joel 2:28 and other passages, to give the Spirit 
through the new message, the Gospel. And he has verified his promise by public 
manifestations in connection with the preaching of that Gospel, as on the day of 
Pentecost and again later. When the apostles, Peter and others, began to preach, 
the Holy Spirit descended visibly from heaven upon their hearts. Acts 8:17; 
10:44. Up to that time, throughout the period the Law was preached, no one had 
heard or seen such manifestation. The fact could not but be grasped that this 
was a vastly different message from that of the Law when such mighty results 
followed in its train. And yet its substance was no more than what Paul declared 
(Acts 13:38-39): &quot;Through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of 
sins: and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from 
which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.&quot;</P>
<P>31. In this teaching you see no more the empty letters, the valueless husks 
or shells of the Law, which unceasingly enjoins., &quot;This thou shalt do and 
observe,&quot; and ever in vain. You see instead the true kernel and power which 
confers Christ and the fullness of His Spirit. In consequence, men heartily 
believe the message of the Gospel and enjoy its<BR></P>

<P>riches. They are accounted as having fulfilled the Ten Commandments. John 
says (Jn 1:16-17): &quot;Of his fullness we all received, and grace for grace. 
For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus 
Christ.&quot; John's thought is: The Law has indeed been given by Moses, but 
what avails that fact? To be sure, it is a noble doctrine and portrays a 
beautiful and instructive picture of man's duty to God and all mankind; it is 
really excellent as to the letter. Yet it remains empty; it does not enter into 
the heart. Therefore it is called &quot;law,&quot; nor can it become aught else, 
so long as nothing more is given.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#232f85>CHRIST SUPERSEDES MOSES</FONT></P>
<P>Before there can be fulfilment, another than Moses must come, bringing 
another doctrine. Instead of a law enjoined, there must be grace and truth 
revealed. For to enjoin a command and to embody the truth are two different 
things; just as teaching and doing differ. Moses, it is true, teaches the 
doctrine of the Law, so far as exposition is concerned, but he can neither 
fulfil it himself nor give others the ability to do so. That it might be 
fulfilled, God's Son had to come with his fullness; he has fulfilled the Law for 
himself and it is he who communicates to our empty heart the power to attain to 
the same fullness.</P>
<P>This becomes possible when we receive grace for grace, that is, when we come 
to the enjoyment of Christ, and for the sake of him who enjoys with God fullness 
of grace, although our own obedience to the Law is still imperfect. Being 
possessed of solace and grace, we receive by his power the Holy Spirit also, so 
that, instead of harboring mere empty letters within us, we come to the truth 
and begin to fulfil God's Law, in such a way, however, that we draw from his 
fullness and drink from that as a fountain.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#232f85>CHRIST THE SOURCE OF LIFE GREATER THAN ADAM THE SOURCE OF 
DEATH</FONT></P>
<P>32. Paul gives us the same thought in Romans 5:17-18, where he compares Adam 
and Christ. Adam, he says, by his<BR></P>

<P>disobedience in Paradise, became the source of sin and death in the world; by 
the sin of this one man, condemnation passed upon all men. But on the other 
hand, Christ, by his obedience and righteousness, has become for us the abundant 
source wherefrom all may obtain righteousness and the power of obedience. And 
with respect to the latter source, it is far richer and more abundant than the 
former. While by the single sin of one man, sin and death passed upon all men, 
to wax still more powerful with the advent of the Law, of such surpassing 
strength and greatness, on the other hand, is the grace and bounty which we have 
in Christ that it not only washes away the particular sin of the one man Adam, 
which, until Christ came, overwhelmed all men in death, but overwhelms and blots 
out all sin whatever. Thus they who receive his fullness of grace and bounty 
unto righteousness are, according to Paul, lords of life through Jesus Christ 
alone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#232f85>THE LAW INEFFECTUAL</FONT></P>
<P>33. You see now how the two messages differ, and why Paul exalts the one, the 
preaching of the Gospel, and calls it a &quot;ministration of the spirit,&quot; 
but terms the other, the Law, a mere empty &quot;letter.&quot; His object is to 
humble the pride of the false apostles and preachers which they felt in their 
Judaism and the law of Moses, telling the people with bold pretensions: 
&quot;Beloved, let Paul preach what he will, he cannot overthrow Moses, who on 
Mount Sinai received the Law, God's irrevocable command, obedience to which is 
ever the only way to salvation.&quot;</P>
<P>34. Similarly today, Papists, Anabaptists and other sects make outcry: 
&quot;What mean you by preaching so much about faith and Christ? Are the people 
thereby made better? Surely works are essential.&quot; Arguments of this 
character have indeed a semblance of merit, but, when examined by the light of 
truth, are mere empty, worthless twaddle. For if deeds, or works, are to be 
considered, there are the Ten Commandments; we teach and practice these as well 
as they. The Commandments would answer the purpose indeed--if one could preach 
them so effectively as to compel their fulfilment.</P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE 
240</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><BR>But the question is, whether what is preached is also practiced. Is there 
something more than were words--or letters, as Paul says? Do the words result in 
life and spirit? This message we have in common; unquestionably, one must teach 
the Ten Commandments, and, what is more, live them. But we charge that they are 
not observed. Therefore something else is requisite in order to render obedience 
to them possible. When Moses and the Law are made to say: &quot;You should do 
thus; God demands this of you,&quot; what does it profit? Ay, beloved Moses, I 
hear that plainly, and it is certainly a righteous command; but pray tell me 
whence shall I obtain ability to do what, alas, I never have done nor can do? It 
is not easy to spend money from an empty pocket, or to drink from an empty can. 
If I am to pay my debt, or to quench my thirst, tell me how first to fill pocket 
or can. But upon this point such prattlers are silent; they but continue to 
drive and plague with the Law, let the people stick to their sins, and make 
merry of them to their own hurt.</P>
<P>35. In this light Paul here portrays the false apostles and like pernicious 
schismatics, who make great boasts of having a clearer understanding and of 
knowing much better what to teach than is the case with true preachers of the 
Gospel. And when they do their very best, when they pretend great things, and do 
wonders with their preaching, there is naught but the mere empty 
&quot;letter.&quot; Indeed, their message falls far short of Moses. Moses was a 
noble preacher, truly, and wrought greater things than any of them may do. 
Nevertheless, the doctrine of the Law could do no more than remain a letter, an 
Old Testament, and God had to ordain a different doctrine, a New Testament, 
which should impart the &quot;spirit.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is the letter,&quot; says Paul, &quot;which we preach. If any 
glorying is to be done, we can glory in better things and make the defiant plea 
that they are not the only teachers of what ought to be done, incapable as they 
are of carrying out their own precepts. We give direction and power as to 
performing and living those precepts. For this reason our message is not called 
the Old Testament, or the message of<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE 
241</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><BR>the dead letter, but that of the New Testament and of the living 
Spirit.&quot;</P>
<P>36. No seditious spirit, it is certain, ever carries out its own precepts, 
nor will he ever be capable of doing so, though he may loudly boast the Spirit 
alone as his guide. Of this fact you may rest assured. For such individuals know 
nothing more than the doctrine of works--nor can they rise higher and point you 
to anything else. They may indeed speak of Christ, but it is only to hold him up 
as an example of patience in suffering. In short, there can be no New Testament 
preached if the doctrine of faith in Christ be left out; the spirit cannot enter 
into the heart, but all teaching, endeavor, reflection, works and power remain 
mere &quot;letters,&quot; devoid of grace, truth, and life. Without Christ the 
heart remains unchanged and unrenewed. It has no more power to fulfil the Law 
than the book in which the Ten Commandments are written, or the stones upon 
which engraved. &quot;For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth 
life.&quot;</P>
<P>37. Here is yet stronger condemnation of the glory of the doctrine of the 
Law; yet higher exaltation of the Gospel ministry. Is the apostle overbold in 
that he dares thus to assail the Law and say: &quot;The Law is not only a 
lifeless letter, but qualified merely to kill&quot;? Surely that is not calling 
the Law a good and profitable message, but one altogether harmful. Who, unless 
he would be a cursed heretic in the eyes of the world and invite execution as a 
blasphemer, would dare to speak thus, except Paul himself? Even Paul must praise 
the Law, which is God's command, declaring it good and not to be despised nor in 
any way modified, but to be confirmed and fulfilled so completely, as Christ 
says (Mt 5:18), that not a tittle of it shall pass away. How, then, does Paul 
come to speak so disparagingly, even abusively, of the Law, actually presenting 
it as veritable death and poison? Well, his is a sublime doctrine, one that 
reason does not understand. The world, particularly they Who would be called 
holy and godly, cannot tolerate it at all; for it amounts to nothing short of 
pronouncing all our works, however precious, mere death and poison.<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE

<P></P>
<P>38. Paul's purpose is to bring about the complete overthrow of the boast of 
the false teachers and hypocrites, and to reveal the weakness of their doctrine, 
showing how little it effects even at its best, since it offers only the Law, 
Christ remaining unproclaimed and unknown. They say in terms of vainglorious 
eloquence that if a man diligently keep the commandments and do many good works, 
he shall be saved. But theirs are only vain words, a pernicious doctrine. This 
fact is eventually learned by him who, having heard no other doctrine, trusts in 
their false one. He finds out that it holds neither comfort nor power of life, 
but only doubt and anxiety, followed by death and destruction.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#232f85>TERRORS OF THE LAW</FONT></P>
<P>39. When man, conscious of his failure to keep God's command, is constantly 
urged by the Law to make payment of his debt and confronted with nothing but the 
terrible wrath of God and eternal condemnation, he cannot but sink into despair 
over his sins. Such is the inevitable consequence where the Law alone is taught 
with a view to attaining heaven thereby. The vanity of such trust in works is 
illustrated in the case of the noted hermit mentioned in Vitae Patrum. (Lives of 
the Fathers). For over seventy years this hermit had led a life of utmost 
austerity, and had many followers. When the hour of death came he began to 
tremble, and for three days was in a state of agony. His disciples came to 
comfort him, exhorting him to die in peace since he had led so holy a life. But 
he replied: &quot;Alas, I truly have all my life served Christ and lived 
austerely; but God's judgment greatly differs from that of men.&quot;</P>
<P>40. Note, this worthy man, despite the holiness of his life, has no 
acquaintance with any article but that of the divine judgment according to the 
Law. He knows not the comfort of Christ's Gospel. After a long life spent in the 
attempt to keep God's commandments and secure salvation, the Law now slays him 
through his own works. He is compelled to exclaim: &quot;Alas, who knows how God 
will look upon my efforts? Who may stand before him?&quot; That means, to 
forfeit heaven through the verdict of his own<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE

<P></P>
<P>conscience. The work he has wrought and his holiness of life avail nothing. 
They merely push him deeper into death, since he is without the solace of the 
Gospel, while others, such as the thief on the cross and the publican, grasp the 
comfort of the Gospel, the forgiveness of sins in Christ. Thus sin is conquered; 
they escape the sentence of the Law, and pass through death into life 
eternal.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#232f85>EFFICACY OF THE GOSPEL</FONT></P>
<P>41. Now the meaning of the contrasting clause, &quot;the spirit giveth 
life,&quot; becomes clear. The reference is to naught else but the holy Gospel, 
a message of healing and salvation; a precious, comforting word. It comforts and 
refreshes the sad heart. It wrests it out of the jaws of death and hell, as it 
were, and transports it to the certain hope of eternal life, through faith in 
Christ. When the last hour comes to the believer, and death and God's judgment 
appear before his eyes, he does not base his comfort upon his works. Even though 
he may have lived the holiest life possible, he says with Paul (1 Cor. 4:4): 
&quot;I know nothing against myself, yet am I not hereby justified.&quot;</P>
<P>42. These words imply being ill pleased with self, with the whole life, 
indeed, even the putting to death of self. Though the heart says, &quot;By my 
works I am neither made righteous nor saved,&quot; which is practically 
admitting oneself to be worthy of death and condemnation, the Spirit extricates 
from despair, through the Gospel faith, which confesses, as did St. Bernard in 
the hour of death: &quot;Dear Lord Jesus, I am aware that my life at its best 
has been but worthy of condemnation, but I trust in the fact that thou hast died 
for me and hast sprinkled me with blood from thy holy wounds. For I have been 
baptized in thy name and have given heed to thy Word whereby thou hast called 
me, awarded me grace and life, and bidden me believe. In this assurance will I 
pass out of life; not in uncertainty and anxiety, thinking, 'Who knows what 
sentence God in heaven will pass upon me?'&quot;</P>
<P>The Christian must not utter such a question. The sentence against his life 
and works has long since been passed<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE 
244<BR></FONT>
<P></P>
<P>by the Law. Therefore, he must confess himself guilty and condemned. But he 
lives by the gracious judgment of God declared from heaven, whereby the sentence 
of the Law is overruled and reversed. It is this: &quot;He that believeth on the 
Son hath eternal life&quot; (Jn. 3:36).</P>
<P>43. When the consolation of the Gospel has once been received and it has 
wrested the heart from death and the terrors of hell, the Spirit's influence is 
felt. By its power God's Law begins to live in man's heart; he loves it, 
delights in it and enters upon its fulfilment. Thus eternal life begins here, 
being continued forever and perfected in the life to come.</P>
<P>44. Now you see how much more glorious, how much better, is the doctrine of 
the apostles--the New Testament--than the doctrine of those who preach merely 
great works and holiness without Christ. We should see in this fact an incentive 
to hear the Gospel with gladness. We ought joyfully to thank God for it when we 
learn how it has power to bring to men life and eternal salvation, and when it 
gives us assurance that the Holy Spirit accompanies it and is imparted to 
believers.</P>
<P>&quot;But if the ministration of death, written, and engraven on stones, came 
with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the 
face of Moses for the glory of his face; which glory was passing away: how shall 
not rather the ministration of the Spirit be with glory? For if the ministration 
of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness 
exceed in glory.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#232f85>GLORY OF THE GOSPEL</FONT></P>
<P>45. Paul is in an ecstasy of delight, and his heart overflows in words of 
praise for the Gospel. Again he handles the Law severely, calling it a 
ministration, or doctrine, of death and condemnation. What term significant of 
greater abomination could he apply to God's Law than to call it a doctrine of 
death and hell? And again (Gal 2:17), he calls it a &quot;minister (or preacher) 
of sin;&quot; and (Gal 3:10) the message which proclaims a curse, saying, 
&quot;As many as are of the<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE 
245</FONT><BR>
<P></P>
<P>works of the law are under a curse.&quot; Absolute, then, is the conclusion 
that Law and works are powerless to justify before God; for how can a doctrine 
proclaiming only sin, death and condemnation justify and save?</P>
<P>46. Paul is compelled to speak thus, as we said above because of the infamous 
presumption of both teachers and pupils, in that they permit flesh and blood to 
coquet with the Law, and make their own works which they bring before God their 
boast. Yet, nothing is effected but self-deception and destruction. For, when 
the Law is viewed in its true light, when its &quot;glory,&quot; as Paul has it, 
is revealed, it is found to do nothing more than to kill man and sink him into 
condemnation.</P>
<P>47. Therefore, the Christian will do well to learn this text of Paul and have 
an armor against the boasting of false teachers, and the torments and trials of 
the devil when he urges the Law and induces men to seek righteousness in their 
own works, tormenting their heart with the thought that salvation is dependent 
upon the achievements of the individual. The Christian will do well to learn 
this text, I say, so that in such conflicts he may take the devil's own sword, 
saying: &quot;Why dost thou annoy me with talk of the Law and my works? What is 
the Law after all, however much you may preach it to me, but that which makes me 
feel the weight of sin, death and condemnation? Why should I seek therein 
righteousness before God?&quot;</P>
<P>48. When Paul speaks of the &quot;glory of the Law,&quot; of which the Jewish 
teachers of work-righteousness boast, he has reference to the things narrated in 
the twentieth and thirtyfourth chapters of Exodus--how, when the Law was given, 
God descended in majesty and glory from heaven, and there were thunderings and 
lightnings, and the mountain was encircled with fire; and how when Moses 
returned from the Mountain, bringing the Law, his face shone with a glory so 
dazzling that the people could not look upon his face and he was obliged to veil 
it.</P>
<P>49. Turning their glory against them, Paul says: &quot;Truly, we do not deny 
the glory; splendor and majesty were there:<BR></P>
<P>
<HR align=left>
<FONT color=#731b31 size=-1>THE SERMONS OF MARTIN LUTHER, VOL. VIII, PAGE 
246</FONT>
<P></P>
<P><BR>but what does such glory do but compel souls to flee before God, and 
drive into death and hell? We believers, however, boast another glory,--that of 
our ministration. The Gospel record tells us (Mt 17:2-4) that Christ clearly 
revealed such glory to his disciples when his face shone as the sun, and Moses 
and Elijah were present. Before the manifestation of such glory, the disciples 
did not flee; they beheld with amazed joy and said: &quot;Lord, it is good for 
us to be here. We will make here tabernacles for thee and for Moses,&quot; 
etc.</P>
<P>50. Compare the two scenes and you will understand plainly the import of 
Paul's words here. As before said, this is the substance of his meaning: 
&quot;The Law produces naught but terror and death when it dazzles the heart 
with its glory and stands revealed in its true nature. On the other hand, the 
Gospel yields comfort and joy.&quot; But to explain in detail the signification 
of the veiled face of Moses, and of his shining uncovered face, would take too 
long to enter upon here.</P>
<P>51. There is also especial comfort to be derived from Paul's assertion that 
the &quot;ministration,&quot; or doctrine, of the Law &quot;passeth away&quot;; 
for otherwise there would be naught but eternal condemnation. The doctrine of 
the Law &quot;passes away&quot; when the preaching of the Gospel of Christ finds 
place. To Christ, Moses shall yield, that he alone may hold sway. Moses shall 
not terrify the conscience of the believer. When, perceiving the glory of Moses, 
the conscience trembles and despairs before God's wrath, then it is time for 
Christ's glory to shine with its gracious, comforting light into the heart. Then 
can the heart endure Moses and Elijah. For the glory of the Law, or the unveiled 
face of Moses, shall shine only until man is humbled and driven to desire the 
blessed countenance of Christ. If you come to Christ, you shall no longer hear 
Moses to your fright and terror; you shall hear him as one who remains servant 
to the Lord Christ, leaving the solace and the joy of his countenance 
unobscured. In conclusion:</P>
<P>&quot;For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made 
glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.&quot;<BR></P>

<P>52. The meaning here is; When the glory and holiness of Christ, revealed 
through the preaching of the Gospel, is rightly perceived then the glory of the 
Law--which is but a feeble and transitory glory--is seen to be not really 
glorious. It is mere dark clouds in contrast to the light of Christ shining to 
lead us out of sin, death and hell unto God and eternal life.<BR></P>
