<p>Martha again came forward and said: "My Lord, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>175</b>.</FONT></span> I am sober in my spirit and understand the words which thou sayest. Now, therefore, give me commandment to set forth their solution in openness."</p>  
<p>And the First Mystery answered and said unto Martha: "I give thee commandment, Martha, to set forth the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered in her song."</p>  
<p>And Martha answered and said: "My Lord, these are the words which thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the seventh Psalm, saying:</p>  
<p>"'12. God is a righteous vindicator and strong and long-suffering, who bringeth not on his wrath every day.</p>

<p>"'14. And he hath made ready for him instruments of death; he hath made his arrows for those who will be burnt up.</p>  
<p>"'15. Behold, injustice hath been in labour, hath conceived wrong and brought forth iniquity.</p>  
<p>"'16. It hath digged a pit and hollowed it out. It will fall into the hole which it hath made.</p>  
<p>"'17. Its wrong will return on its own head, and its injustice will come down on its pate.'"</p>  
<p>When Martha had said this, the First Mystery which looketh without, said unto her: "Well said, finely, Martha, blessed [one]."</p>
