<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The disciples gather round Jesus.</FONT></span>IT came to pass then, when Jesus our Lord had been crucified and had risen from the dead on the third day, that his disciples gathered round him, adored him and said: "Our Lord, have mercy upon us, for we have abandoned father and mother and the whole world and have followed thee."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The invocation of Jesus.</FONT></span>At that time Jesus stood with his disciples on the water of the Ocean and made invocation with this prayer, saying: "Hear me, my Father, father of all fatherhood, boundless Light: <i>ae&#275;iou&#333; ia&#333; a&#333;i &#333;ia psin&#333;ther thern&#333;ps n&#333;psither zagour&#275; pagour&#275; nethmoma&#333;th nepsioma&#333;th marachachtha th&#333;barrabau tharnachachan zorokothora ieou</i> [= <i>Yew</i>] <i>saba&#333;th</i>."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The grouping of the disciples.</FONT></span>And while Jesus said this, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>358</b>.</FONT></span> Thomas, Andrew, James and Simon the Cananite were in the west with their faces turned towards the east, and Philip and Bartholomew were in the south turned towards the north, and the rest of the disciples and the women-disciples stood back of Jesus. But Jesus stood at the altar.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The interpretation of <i>ia&#333;</i>.</FONT></span>And Jesus made invocation, turning himself towards the four corners of the world with his disciples, who were all clad in linen garments, and saying: "<i>ia&#333;&nbsp;ia&#333;&nbsp;ia&#333;</i>." This is its interpretation: <i>i&#333;ta</i>, because the universe hath gone</p>  
<p><a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="green">p. 296</font></A></p>  
<p>forth; <i>alpha</i>, because it will turn itself back again; <i>&#333;mega</i>, because the completion of all the completeness will take place.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">He continueth to make invocation.</FONT></span>And when Jesus had said this, he said: "<i>iaphtha&nbsp;iaphtha mouna&#275;r&nbsp;mouna&#275;r ermanou&#275;r&nbsp;ermanou&#275;r</i>." That is: "O father of all fatherhood of the boundless [spaces], hear me for the sake of my disciples whom I have led before thee, that they may have faith in all the words of thy truth, and grant all for which I shall invoke thee; for I know the name of the father of the Treasury of the Light."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The apocalypse of the heavens.</FONT></span>Again did Jesus,--that is Aberamenth&#333;,--make invocation, speaking the name of the father of the Treasury of the Light, and said: "Let all the mysteries of the rulers and the authorities and the angels and the archangels and all powers and |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>359</b>.</FONT></span> all things of the invisible god Agrammachamarei and Barb&#275;l&#333; draw near the Leech [Bdella] on one side and withdraw to the right."</p>  
<p>And in that hour all the heavens went to the west, and all the &aelig;ons and the sphere and their rulers and all their powers flew together to the west to the left of the disk of the sun and the disk of the moon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The figures of the disk of the sun and of the moon.</FONT></span>And the disk of the sun was a great dragon whose tail was in his mouth and who reached to seven powers of the Left and whom four powers in the form of white horses drew.</p>  
<p>And the base of the moon had the type of a ship which a male and a female dragon steered and two white bulls drew. The figure of a babe was on the stern of the moon who guided the dragons who robbed the light from the rulers. And on its prow was a cat's face.</p>  
<p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="green">p. 297</font></A></p>  
<p>And the whole world and the mountains and the seas fled together to the west to the left.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jesus and the disciples are transported to the ways of the midst.</FONT></span>And Jesus and his disciples remained in the midst in an a&euml;ry region on the ways of the way of the midst, which lieth below the sphere. And they came to the first order of the way of the midst. And Jesus stood in the air of its region with his disciples.</p>  
<p>The disciples of Jesus said unto him: "What is this region |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>360</b>.</FONT></span> in which we are?</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the repentant and unrepentant rulers.</FONT></span>Jesus said: "These are the regions of the way of the midst. For it came to pass, when the rulers of Adamas mutinied and persistently practised congress, procreating rulers, archangels, angels, servitors and decans, that Yew, the father of my father, came forth from the Right and bound them to a Fate-sphere.</p>  
<p>"For there are twelve &aelig;ons; over six Saba&#333;th, the Adamas, ruleth, and his brother Yabra&#333;th ruleth over the other six. At that time then Yabra&#333;th with his rulers had faith in the mysteries of the Light and was active in the mysteries of the Light and abandoned the mystery of congress. But Saba&#333;th, the Adamas, and his rulers have persisted in the practice of congress.</p>  
<p>"And when Yew, the father of my father, saw that Yabra&#333;th had faith, he carried him and all the rulers who had had faith with him, took him unto himself out of the sphere and led him into a purified air in face of the light of the sun between the regions of those of the midst and between [?] the regions of the invisible god. He posted him there with the rulers who had had faith in him.</p>  
<p>"But he carried Saba&#333;th, the Adamas, and his</p>  
<p><a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="green">p. 298</font></A></p>  
<p>rulers who had not been active in the mysteries of the Light, but have been persistently active in the mysteries of congress, and inbound them into the sphere.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the hierarchies of the un-repentant rulers and the names of their five regents.</FONT></span>"He bound eighteen-hundred rulers in every &aelig;on, and set three-hundred-and-sixty |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>361</b>.</FONT></span> over them, and he set five other great rulers as lords over the three-hundred-and-sixty and over all the bound rulers, who in the whole world of mankind are called with these names: the first is called Kronos, the second Ar&#275;s, the third Herm&#275;s, the fourth Aphrodit&#275;, the fifth Zeus."</p>
