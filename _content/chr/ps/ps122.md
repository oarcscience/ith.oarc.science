### CHAPTER 117

<span class="margnote">Mary further questioneth Jesus.</span>Mary
answered again and said: "My Lord, I will still continue to question
thee. Now, therefore, my Lord, bear with me questioning thee. Lo, in
openness have we known the type in which the baptisms forgive sins. Now
on the other hand the mystery of these three spaces and the mysteries of
this First Mystery and the mysteries of the Ineffable, in what type do
they forgive sins? Do they forgive in the type \|<span
class="rmargnote">**303**.</span> of the baptisms, or not?"

<span class="margnote">Of the forgiveness of sins according to the
higher mysteries.</span>The Saviour answered again and said: "Nay, but
all the mysteries of the three spaces forgive the soul in all the
regions of the rulers all the sine which the soul hath committed from
the beginning onwards. They forgive it, and moreover they forgive the
sins which it thereafter will commit, until the time up to which every
one of the mysteries shall be effective,--the time up to which every one
of the mysteries shall be effective I will tell you at the expansion of
the universe.

"And moreover the mystery of the First Mystery and the mysteries of the
Ineffable forgive the soul in all the regions of the rulers all the sins
and all the iniquities which the soul hath committed; and \[not only\]
do they forgive it all, but they impute unto it no sin from this hour
unto all eternity, because of the gift of that great mystery and its
prodigiously great glory."
