<p>It came to pass then again after all these words, that Jesus continued in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "Hearken, that I may discourse with you concerning the glory of those of the Height, how they are, according to the manner in which I discoursed with you unto this day.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the last Helper.</FONT></span>"Now, therefore, if I lead you into the region of the last Helper, who surroundeth the Treasury of the Light, and if I lead you into the region of that last Helper and ye see the glory in which he is, then will the region of the Inheritance of the Light count for you only for the size of a city of the world, because of the greatness in which the last Helper is, and because of the great light in which he is.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">That the regions beyond the Helpers are indescribable.</FONT></span>"And thereafter I will discourse with you also concerning the glory of the Helper who is above the little Helper. But I shall not be able to discourse with you concerning the regions of those who are above all Helpers; |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>199</b>.</FONT></span> for there existeth no type in this world, to describe them, for there existeth in this world no likeness which is like unto them, that I may compare them therewith, nor greatness nor light which is like unto them, not only in this world, but they also have no likeness with those of the Height of Righteousness from their region upwards. On this account, therefore, there existeth in fact no manner of describing them in this world because of the great glory of those of the Height and because of the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>great immeasurable greatness. On this account, therefore, there existeth no manner to describe it in this world."</p>  
<p>It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disciples, that Mary Magdalene came forward and said unto Jesus: "My Lord, be not wroth with me if I question thee, because I trouble repeatedly. Now, therefore, my Lord, be not wroth with me if I question thee concerning all with precision and certainty. For my brethren will herald it among the race of men, so that they may hear and repent and be saved from the violent judgments of the evil rulers and go to the Height and inherit the Light-kingdom; because, my Lord, we are compassionate not only towards ourselves, but compassionate towards the whole race of men, so that they may be saved from all the violent judgments. Now, therefore, my Lord, on this account we question concerning all with certainty; for my brethren herald it to the whole race of men, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>200</b>.</FONT></span> in order that they may escape the violent rulers of the darkness and be saved out of the hands of the violent receivers of the outer-most darkness."</p>  
<p>It came to pass, when Jesus had heard Mary say these words, that the Saviour answered in great compassion towards her and said unto her: "Question concerning what thou desirest to question, and I will reveal it unto thee with precision and certainty and without similitude."</p>
