<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The powers adore the light-vesture.</FONT></span>And Jesus continued again in his discourse and said unto his disciples: "Hearken concerning the things which befell me among the rulers of the twelve &aelig;ons and all their rulers and their lords and their authorities and their angels and their archangels. When then they had seen the vesture of light which was about me, they and their unpaired, then every one of them saw the mystery of his name, that it was on my vesture of light, which was about me. They fell down all together, adored the vesture of light which was about me, and cried out all together, saying: 'How hath the lord of the universe passed through us without our knowing it?' And they all sang praises together to the interiors of the interiors. And all their triple-powers and their great forefathers and their ungenerated and their self-generated and their generated and their gods and their light-sparks and their light-bearers--in a word all their great ones--saw the tyrants of their region, that their power was diminished in them. And they were in weakness and themselves fell into great and immeasurable fear. And they gazed on the mystery of their name on my vesture, and they had set out to come and adore the mystery of their name which was on my vesture, and they could not because of the great light which was about me; but they adored a little removed from me, and they adored the light of my vesture and all cried out together, singing praises to the interiors of the interiors.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The tyrants become as the dead.</FONT></span>"It came to pass then, when this befell among the tyrants who are below these rulers, that they all lost power and fell down to the ground in their &aelig;ons and became as the dead world-</p>

<p>dwellers with no breath in them, as they |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>42</b>.</FONT></span> became in the hour when I took from them their power.</p>  
<p>"It came to pass then thereafter, when I left those &aelig;ons, that every one of all those who were in the twelve &aelig;ons, was bound to their order all together, and they accomplished their works as I have established them, so that they spend six months turned to the left and accomplishing their works in their squares and their triangles and in those which are in their aspect, and that further they spend another six months facing to the right and towards their triangles and their squares and those which are in their aspect. Thus then will those who are in the Fate and in the sphere travel.</p>
