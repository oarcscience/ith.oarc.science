<p>Mary said: "A man who hath committed all sins and all iniquities and hath not found the mysteries of the Light, will he receive the chastisements for them all at once?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">A sinner suffereth for each separate sin.</FONT></span>Jesus answered: "Yea, he will receive it; if he hath committed three sins, he will receive chastisement for three."</p>

<p>John said: "A man who hath committed all sins and all iniquities, but at last hath found the mysteries of the Light, is it possible for him to be saved?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Even the greatest of sinners, if he repent, shall inherit the kingdom.</FONT></span>Jesus said: "Such a man who hath committed all sins and all iniquities, and he findeth the mysteries of the Light, and performeth and fulfilleth them and ceaseth not nor doeth sins, will inherit the Treasury of the Light."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the time favourable for the birth of those who shall find the mysteries.</FONT></span>Jesus said unto his disciples: "When the sphere turneth itself, and Kronos and Ar&#275;s come behind the Virgin of Light and Zeus and Aphrodite come in face of the Virgin, they being in their own &aelig;ons, then the veils of the Virgin draw themselves aside and she falleth into joy in that hour when she seeth these two light-stars before her. And all the souls which she shall cast at that hour into the circuit of the &aelig;ons of the sphere, that |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>390</b>.</FONT></span> they may come into the world, will be righteous and good and find at this time the mysteries of the Light; she sendeth them anew that they may find the mysteries of the Light.</p>  
<p>"If on the other hand Ar&#275;s and Kronos come in face of the Virgin and Zeus and Aphrodit&#275; behind her, so that she seeth them not, then all the souls which she shall cast in that hour into the creatures of the sphere, will be wicked and wrathful and do not find the mysteries of the Light."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The disciples beseech Jesus to have mercy upon them.</FONT></span>When then Jesus said this unto his disciples in the midst of the Amente, the disciples cried and wept, [saying]: "Woe, woe unto sinners, on whom the negligence and the forgetfulness of the rulers lie until they come out of the body and are led to these chastisements! Have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us, son of the Holy</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> [One], and have compassion with us, that we may be saved from these chastisements and these judgments which are prepared for the sinners; for we also have sinned, our Lord and our Light."</p>
