And all &aelig;ons and all heavens and their whole ordering were agitated one over against the other on |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>25</b>.</FONT></span> account of the great fear which was on them, for they knew not the mystery which had taken place. And Adamas, the great Tyrant, and all the tyrants in all the &aelig;ons began to fight in vain against the light, and they knew not against whom they fought, because they saw nothing but the overmastering light.</p>  
<p>"It came to pass then, when they fought against the light, that they were weakened all together one with another, were dashed down in the &aelig;ons and became as the inhabitants of the earth, dead and without breath of life.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">He taketh from them a third of their power.</FONT></span>"And I took from all a third of their power, that they should no more be active in their evil doings, and that, if the men who are in the world, invoke them in their mysteries--those which the angels who transgressed have brought down, that is their sorceries,--in order that, therefore, if they invoke them in their evil doings, they may not be able to accomplish them.</p>

For by command of the First Commandment and by command of the First Mystery |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>26</b>.</FONT></span> Yew, the Overseer of the Light, had set them facing the left at every time and accomplishing their influences and their deeds.</p>
