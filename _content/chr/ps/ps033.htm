<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jesus entereth the thirteenth &aelig;on and findeth Pistis Sophia.</FONT></span>"It came to pass then thereafter that I ascended to the veils of the thirteenth &aelig;on. It came to pass then, when I had arrived at their veils, that they drew apart of their own accord and opened themselves for me. I entered in into the thirteenth &aelig;on and found Pistis Sophia below the thirteenth &aelig;on all alone and no one of them with her. And she sat in that region grieving and mourning, because she had not been admitted into the thirteenth &aelig;on, her higher region. And she was moreover grieving because of the torments which Self-willed, who is one of the three triple-powers, had inflicted on her. But this,--when I shall come to speak with you respecting their expansion, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>43</b>.</FONT></span> I will tell you the mystery, how this befell her.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Sophia and her fellow-powers behold the light.</FONT></span>"It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia saw me shining most exceedingly and with no measure for the light which was about me, that she was in</p>  
<p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></A></p>  
<p>great agitation and gazed at the light of my vesture. She saw the mystery of her name on my vesture and the whole glory of its mystery, for formerly she was in the region of the height, in the thirteenth &aelig;on,--but she was wont to sing praises to the higher light, which she had seen in the veil of the Treasury of the Light.</p>  
<p>"It came to pass then, when she persisted in singing praises to the higher light, that all the rulers who are with the two great triple-powers, and her invisible who is paired with her, and the other two-and-twenty invisible emanations gazed [at the light],--in as much as Pistis Sophia and her pair, they and the other two-and-twenty emanations make up four-and-twenty emanations, which the great invisible Forefather and the two great triple-powers have emanated."</p>
