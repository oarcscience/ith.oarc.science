### CHAPTER 13

<span class="margnote">He entereth the second sphere.</span>"And I left
that region behind me and came to the gate of the second sphere, which
is the Fate. Then were all its gates thrown into agitation and opened of
themselves. And I entered into the houses of the Fate, shining most
exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light that was about me,
for I shone in the Fate forty-and-nine times more than in the \[first\]
sphere.

<span class="margnote">The powers of the second sphere are amazed and
fall down and adore him.</span>"And all the rulers and all those who are
in the Fate, were thrown into agitation and fell on one another and were
in exceeding great fear on seeing the great light that was about me. And
they gazed on my vesture of light and saw the mystery of their name on
my vesture and fell into still greater agitation; and they were in great
fear, saying: 'How hath the lord of the universe passed through us
without our knowing?' And all the bonds of their regions and of their
orders and of their houses were unloosed; they all came at once, fell
down, adored before me and sang praises all together \|<span
class="rmargnote">**23**.</span> to the interiors of the interiors,
being in great fear and great agitation.
