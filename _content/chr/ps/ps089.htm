<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the glory of the four-and-twenty invisibles.</FONT></span>And Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "What is there in this world which is like unto them, or rather what region is there in this world which is comparable to them? Now, therefore, to what am I to liken them, or rather what am I to say concerning them? For nothing existeth in this world to which I shall be able to liken them, and no form existeth in it which is able to be like them. Now, therefore, nothing existeth in this world which is of the quality of the heaven. [But] am&#275;n, I say unto you: Every one of the invisibles is nine times greater than the heaven and the sphere above it and the twelve &aelig;ons all together, as I have already said unto you at another time. And no light existeth in this world which is more excellent than the light of the sun. Am&#275;n, am&#275;n, I say unto you: The four-and-twenty invisibles shine ten-thousand times more than the light of the sun which is in this world, as I have already|<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>184</b>.</FONT></span> said unto you at another time. For the light</p>  
<p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="green">p. 156</font></A></p>  
<p>of the sun in its shape in truth is not in this world, for its light pierceth through many veils and regions. But the light of the sun in its shape in truth, which is in the region of the Virgin of Light, shineth ten-thousand times more than the four-and-twenty invisibles and the great invisible forefather and also the great triple-powered god, as I have already said unto you at another time.</p>  
<p>"Now, therefore, Mary, there is no form in this world, nor any light, nor any shape, which is comparable to the four-and-twenty invisibles, so that I may liken it to them. But yet a little while and I will lead thee and thy brethren and fellow-disciples into all the regions of the Height and will lead you into the three spaces of the First Mystery, save only the regions of the space of the Ineffable, and ye shall see all their shapes in truth without similitude.</p>  
<p>"And if I lead you into the height and ye shall see the glory of them of the height, then will ye be in very great amazement.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the glory of the Fate.</FONT></span>"And if I lead you into the region of the rulers of the Fate, then will ye see the glory in which they are, and because of their overtowering great glory ye will deem this world before you as darkness of darknesses, and |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>185</b>.</FONT></span> ye will look at the whole world of men, how it will have the condition of a speck of dust for you because of the great distance it is far distant from it, and because of the great condition it is considerably greater than it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the glory of the twelve &aelig;ons.</FONT></span>"And if I lead you into the twelve &aelig;ons, then will ye see the glory in which they are; and because of the great glory the region of the rulers of the Fate will count for you as the darkness</p>  
<p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="green">p. 157</font></A></p>  
<p>of darknesses, and it will have for you the condition of a speck of dust because of the great distance it is far distant from it and because of the great condition it is considerably greater than them, as I have already said unto you at another time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the glory of the thirteenth &aelig;on.</FONT></span>"And if I lead you moreover into the thirteenth &aelig;on, then will ye see the glory in which they are; the twelve &aelig;ons will count for you as the darkness of darknesses, and ye shall look at the twelve &aelig;ons, how it [<i>sc.</i> their region] will have for you the likeness of a speck of dust because of the great distance it is far distant from it, and because of the great condition it is considerably greater than the former.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the glory of the Midst.</FONT></span>"And if I lead you into the region of those of the Midst, then will ye see the glory in which they are; the thirteen &aelig;ons will count for you as the darkness of darknesses. And again ye will look at the twelve &aelig;ons |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>186</b>.</FONT></span> and upon the whole Fate and the whole ordering and all the spheres and all the others in which they are; they will have for you the condition of a speck of dust because of the great distance it [<i>sc.</i> their region] is distant from it and because of the great condition it is considerably greater than the former.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the glory of the Right.</FONT></span>"And if I lead you into the region of those of the Right, then will ye see the glory in which they are; the region of those of the Midst will count for you as the night which is in the world of men. And if ye look at the Midst, it will have for you the condition of a speck of dust because of the great distance the region of those of the Right is considerably distant from it.</p>  
<p>"And if I lead you into the Light-land, that</p>  
<p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the glory of the Treasury.</FONT></span>is into the Treasury of the Light, and ye see the glory in which they are, then will the region of those of the Right count for you as the light at mid-day in the world of men, when the sun is not out; and if ye look at the region of those of the Right, it will have for you the condition of a speck of dust because of the great distance the Treasury of the Light is distant from it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the glory of the Inheritance.</FONT></span>"And if I lead you into the region of those who have received the inheritances and have received the mysteries of the Light, and ye see the glory of the Light in which they are, then the Light-land will count for you as the light of the sun which is in the world of men. And if ye look upon the Light-land, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>187</b>.</FONT></span> then will it count for you as a speck of dust because of the great distance the Light-land is distant from it, and because of the greatness [by which] it is considerably greater than the former."</p>
