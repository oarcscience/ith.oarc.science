<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of Ariouth the Ethiopian.</FONT></span>"He continued in the discourse and said: "The second order is called Ariouth the &AElig;thiopian, a female ruler, who is entirely black, under whom stand fourteen other [arch]demons which rule over a multitude of other demons. And it is those demons which stand under Ariouth the &AElig;thiopian, that enter into strife-seekers until they stir up wars and murders arise, and they harden their heart and seduce it to wrath in order that murders may arise.</p>  
<p>"And the souls which this authority will carry off in ravishment, pass one-hundred-and-thirteen years in her regions, while she tormenteth them through her dark smoke and her wicked fire, so that they come nigh unto destruction.</p>  
<p>"And thereafter, when the sphere turneth itself, and the little Saba&#333;th, the Good, who is called</p>  
<p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="green">p. 304</font></A></p>  
<p>in the world Zeus, cometh, and he cometh to the fourth &aelig;on of the sphere, that is the Crab, and Boubastis, who is called in the world Aphrodit&#275;, cometh into the tenth &aelig;on of the sphere which is called the |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>368</b>.</FONT></span> Goat, at that time the veils which are between those of the Left and those of the Right, draw themselves aside, and Yew looketh forth to the right; the whole world becometh alarmed and is agitated together with all the &aelig;ons of the sphere. And he looketh on the dwellings of Ariouth the Ethiopian, so that her regions are dissolved and ruined, and all the souls which are in her chastisements are carried off and cast back into the sphere anew, because they are ruined through her dark smoke and her wicked fire."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of Triple-faced Hekat&#275;.</FONT></span>He continued further in his discourse and said: "The third order is called Triple-faced Hekat&#275;, and there are under her authority seven-and-twenty [arch]demons, and it is they which enter into men and seduce them to perjuries and lies and to covet that which doth not belong to them.</p>  
<p>"The souls then which Hekat&#275; beareth hence in ravishment, she handeth over to her demons which stand under her, in order that they may torment them through her dark smoke and her wicked fire, they being exceedingly afflicted through the demons. And they spend one-hundred-and-five years and six months, being chastized in her wicked chastisements; and they begin to be dissolved and destroyed.</p>  
<p>"And thereafter, when the sphere turneth itself, and the little Saba&#333;th, the Good, he of the Midst, who is called in the world Zeus, cometh, and he cometh to the |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>369</b>.</FONT></span> eighth &aelig;on of the sphere</p>  
<p><a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="green">p. 305</font></A></p>  
<p>which is called the Scorpion, and when Boubastis, whom they call Aphrodit&#275;, cometh, and she cometh to the second &aelig;on of the sphere which is called the Bull, then the veils which are between those of the Right and those of the Left draw themselves aside and Zorokothora Melchisedec looketh out of the height; and the world and the mountains are agitated and the &aelig;ons become alarmed. And he looketh on all the regions of Hekat&#275;, so that her regions are dissolved and destroyed, and all the souls which are in her chastisements, are carried off and cast back anew into the sphere, because they are dissolved in the fire of her chastisements."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of Parhedr&#333;n Typhon.</FONT></span>He continued and said: "The fourth order is called Parhedr&#333;n Typh&#333;n, who is a mighty ruler, under whose authority are two-and-thirty demons. And it is they which enter into men and seduce them to lusting, fornicating, adultery and to the continual practice of intercourse. The souls then which this ruler will carry off in ravishment, pass one-hundred-and-twenty-and-eight years in his regions, while his demons torment them through his dark smoke and his wicked fire, so that they begin to be ruined and destroyed.</p>  
<p>"It cometh to pass then, when the sphere turneth itself and the little Saba&#333;th, the Good, he of the Midst, who is called Zeus, cometh, and when he cometh to the ninth &aelig;on of the sphere which is called the Archer, and when Boubastis, who is called in the world Aphrodit&#275;, cometh, and she cometh to the third &aelig;on of the sphere which is called the Twins, then the veils which are between those of the Left and those of the Right, draw themselves aside, and there looketh</p>  
<p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></A></p>  
<p>forth Zarazaz, whom the rulers call with the name of a mighty ruler of their regions 'Maskelli,' and he looketh on the dwellings of Parhedr&#333;n Typh&#333;n, so that his regions are dissolved and destroyed. And all the souls which are in his chastisements are carried and cast back anew into the sphere, because they are reduced through his dark smoke and his wicked fire."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of Yachthanabas.</FONT></span>Again he continued in the discourse and said unto this disciples: "The fifth order, whose ruler is called Yachthanabas, is a mighty ruler under whom standeth a multitude of other demons. It is they which enter into men and bring it about that they have respect of persons,--treating the just with injustice, and favour the cause of sinners, taking gifts for a just judgment and perverting it, forgetting the poor and needy,--they [the demons] increasing the forgetfulness in their souls and the care for that which |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>371</b>.</FONT></span> bringeth no benefit, in order that they may not think of their life, so that when they come out of the body, they are carried in ravishment.</p>  
<p>"The souls then which this ruler will carry off in ravishment, are in his chastisements one-hundred-and-fifty years and eight months; and he destroyeth them through his dark smoke and his wicked fire, while they are exceedingly afflicted through the flames of his fire.</p>  
<p>"And when the sphere turneth itself and the little Saba&#333;th, the Good, who is called in the world Zeus, cometh, and he cometh to the eleventh &aelig;on of the sphere which is called the Water-man, and when Boubastis cometh to the fifth &aelig;on of the sphere which is called the Lion, then the veils which are between those of the Left and those</p>  
<p><a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="green">p. 307</font></A></p>  
<p>of the Right, draw themselves aside, and there looketh out of the height the great Ia&#333;, the Good, he of the Midst, on the regions of Yachthanabas, so that his regions are dissolved and destroyed. And all the souls which are in his chastisements are carried off and cast back anew into the sphere, because they are ruined in his chastisements.</p>  
<p>"These then are the doings of the ways of the midst concerning which ye have questioned me."</p>
