<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jesus ascendeth into heaven.</FONT></span>It came to pass then, when that light-power had come down over Jesus, that it gradually surrounded him entirely. Then Jesus ascended or soared into the height, shining most exceedingly in an immeasurable light. And the disciples gazed after him and none of them spake, until he had reached unto heaven; but they all kept in deep silence.

And all the angels and their archangels and all the powers of the height, all sang praises to the interiors of the |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>7</b>.</FONT></span> interiors, so that the whole world heard their voices, without their ceasing till the ninth hour of the morrow.</p>
