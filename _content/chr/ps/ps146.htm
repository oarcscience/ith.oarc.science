<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The disciples beseech Jesus to have mercy upon sinners.</FONT></span>And when the disciples had heard this, they fell down, adored him and said: "Help us now, Lord, and have mercy upon us, in order that we may be preserved from these wicked chastisements which are prepared for the sinners. Woe |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>372</b>.</FONT></span> unto them, woe unto the children of men! For they grope as the blind in the darkness and see not. Have mercy upon us, O Lord, in this great blindness in which we are. And have mercy upon the whole race of men; for they have lain in wait for their souls, as lions for their prey, making it [<i>sc.</i> the prey] ready as food for their [<i>sc.</i> the rulers'] chastisements because of the forgetfulness and unknowing which is in them. Have mercy then upon us, our Lord, our Saviour, have mercy upon us and save us in this great stupefaction."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jesus encourageth his disciples.</FONT></span>Jesus said unto his disciples: "Be comforted and be not afraid, for ye are blessed, because I will make you lords over all these and put them in subjection under your feet. Remember that I have already said unto you before I was crucified: 'I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.' Now, therefore, I say unto you: I will give them unto you."</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jesus and his disciples ascend higher.</FONT></span>When then Jesus said this, he chanted a song of praise in the great name. The regions of the ways of the midst hid themselves, and Jesus and his disciples remained in an air of exceedingly strong light.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">He breatheth into their eyes.</FONT></span>Jesus said unto his disciples: "Draw near unto me." And they drew near unto him. He turned himself towards the four corners of the world, said the great name over their heads, blessed them and breathed into their eyes.</p>  
<p>Jesus said unto them: "Look up and see what ye may see."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Their eyes are opened.</FONT></span>And they raised their eyes and saw a |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>373</b>.</FONT></span> great, exceedingly mighty light, which no man in the world can describe.</p>  
<p>He said unto them anew: "Look away out of the light and see what ye may see."</p>  
<p>They said: "We see fire, water, wine and blood."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jesus explaineth the vision of fire and water, and wine and blood.</FONT></span>Jesus,--that is Aberamenth&#333;,--said unto his disciples: "Am&#275;n, I say unto you: I have brought nothing into the world when I came, save this fire, this water, this wine and this blood. I have brought the water and the fire out of the region of the Light of the lights of the Treasury of the Light; and I have brought the wine and the blood out of the region of Barb&#275;l&#333;. And after a little while my father sent me the holy spirit in the type of a dove.</p>  
<p>"And the fire, the water and the wine are for the purification of all the sins of the world. The blood on the other hand was for a sign unto me because of the human body which I received in the region of Barb&#275;l&#333;, the great power of the</p>  
<p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="green">p. 309</font></A></p>  
<p>invisible god. The breath on the other hand advanceth towards all souls and leadeth them unto the region of the Light.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The same explained from former sayings.</FONT></span>"For this cause have I said unto you: 'I am come to cast fire on the earth,'--that is: I am come to purify the sins of the whole world with fire.</p>  
<p>"And for this cause have I said to the Samaritan woman: 'If thou knewest of the gift of God, and who it is who saith unto thee: Give me to drink,--thou wouldst ask, and he would give thee |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>374</b>.</FONT></span> living water, and there would be in thee a spring which welleth up for everlasting life.'</p>  
<p>"And for this cause I took also a cup of wine, blessed it and give it unto you and said: 'This is the blood of the covenant which will be poured out for you for the forgiveness of your sins.'</p>  
<p>"And for this cause they have also thrust the spear into my side, and there came forth water and blood.</p>  
<p>"And these are the mysteries of the Light which forgive sins; that is to say, these are the namings and the names of the Light."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jesus and his disciples descend to earth.</FONT></span>It came to pass then thereafter that Jesus gave command: "Let all the powers of the Left go to their regions." And Jesus with his disciples remained on the Mount of Galilee. The disciples continued and besought him: "For how long then hast thou not let our sins which we have committed, and our iniquities be forgiven and made us worthy of the kingdom of thy father?</p>  
<p>And Jesus said unto them: "Am&#275;n, I say</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jesus promiseth to give them the mystery of the forgiveness of sins.</FONT></span>unto you: Not only will I purify your sins, but I will make you worthy of the kingdom of my father. And I will give you the mystery of the forgiveness of sins, in order that to him whom ye shall forgive on earth, it will be forgiven in heaven, and he whom ye shall bind on earth, will be bound in heaven. I will give you the mystery of the kingdom of heaven, in order that ye your-selves may perform them [<i>sc.</i> the mysteries] for men."</p>
