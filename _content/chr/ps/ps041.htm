Am&#275;n, am&#275;n, I say unto you: |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>60</b>.</FONT></span> I will perfect you in all fulness from the mysteries of the interior to the mysteries of the exterior and fill you with the spirit, so that ye shall be called 'spiritual, perfected in all fulness.' And, am&#275;n, am&#275;n, I say unto you: I will give unto you all the mysteries of all the regions of my Father and of all the regions of the First Mystery, so that he whom ye shall admit on earth, shall be admitted into the Light of the height; and he whom ye shall expel on earth, shall be expelled from the kingdom of my Father in the heaven.

<p>"'3. May they turn quickly to darkness, who press me sore and say: We have become lords over her.</p>  
<p>"'4. May rather all those who seek the Light, rejoice and exult, and they who desire thy mystery, say ever: May the mystery be exalted.</p>  
<p>"'5. Save me then now, O Light, for I lacked my light, which they have taken away, and I needed my power, which they have taken from me. Thou then, O Light, thou art my saviour, and thou art my deliverer, O Light. Save me quickly out of this chaos.'"</p>
