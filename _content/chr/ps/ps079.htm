<p>It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished setting forth these words unto the disciples, that he said unto them: "Who hath understood the solution of these words, let him come forward and say it in openness."</p>  
<p>Mary again came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning these words with which Pistis Sophia hath sung praises, thus thy light-power prophesied them through David:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Mary interpreteth from Psalm cii.</FONT></span>"'1. My soul, praise the Lord, let all that is in me praise his holy name.</p>  
<p>"'2. My soul, praise the Lord and forget not all his requitals.</p>  
<p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></A></p>  
<p>"'3. Who forgiveth all thy iniquities; who healeth all thy sicknesses;</p>  
<p>"'4. Who redeemeth thy life from decay; who wreatheth thee with grace and compassion;</p>  
<p>"'5. Who satisfieth thy longing with good things; thy youth will renew itself as an eagle's.'</p>  
<p>"That is: Sophia will be as the invisibles who are in the Height; he hath, therefore, said 'as an eagle,' because the dwelling-place of the eagle is in the height, and the |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>164</b>.</FONT></span> invisibles also are in the Height; that is: Pistis Sophia will shine as the invisibles, as she was from her beginning."</p>  
<p>It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard Mary say these words, that he said: "Well said, Mary, blessed one."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Sophia is led to a region below the thirteenth &aelig;on and given a new mystery.</FONT></span>It came to pass then thereafter, that the First Mystery continued again in the discourse and said unto the disciples: "I took Pistis Sophia and led her up to a region which is below the thirteenth &aelig;on, and gave unto her a new mystery of the Light which is not that of her &aelig;on, the region of the invisibles. And moreover I gave her a song of the Light, so that from now on the rulers of the &aelig;ons could not [prevail] against her. And I removed her to that region until I should come after her and bring her to her higher region.</p>  
<p>"It came to pass then, when I had removed her to that region, that she again uttered this song thus:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">She continueth to sing.</FONT></span>"'1. In faith have I had faith in the Light; and it remembered me and hearkened to my song.</p>  
<p>"'2. It hath led my power up out of the chaos and the nether darkness of the whole matter and it hath led me up. It hath removed. me to a higher</p>  
<p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></A></p>  
<p>and surer &aelig;on, lofty and firm; it hath changed my place on the way which leadeth to my region.</p>  
<p>"'3. And it hath given unto me a new mystery, which is not that of my &aelig;on, and given unto me a song of the Light. Now, therefore, O Light, all the rulers will see what thou hast done unto me, and be |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>165</b>.</FONT></span>afraid and have faith in the Light.'</p>  
<p>This song then Pistis Sophia uttered, rejoicing that she had been led up out of the chaos and brought to regions which are below the thirteenth &aelig;on. Now, therefore, let him whom his mind stirreth, so that he understandeth the solution of the thought of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, come forward and say it."</p>  
<p>Andrew came forward and said: "My Lord, this is concerning what thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Andrew interpreteth from Psalm xxxix.</FONT></span>"'1. In patience I tarried for the Lord; he hath given heed unto me and ear unto my weeping.</p>  
<p>"'2. He hath led up my soul out of the pit of misery and out of the filthy mire; he hath set my feet on a rock and made straight my steps.</p>  
<p>"'3. He hath put in my mouth a new song, a song of praise for our God. Many will see and be afraid and hope in the Lord.'"</p>  
<p>It came to pass then, when Andrew had set forth the thought of Pistis Sophia, that the First Mystery said unto him: "Well said, Andrew, blessed one."</p>
