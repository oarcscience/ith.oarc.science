<p>When then the Saviour had said this unto his disciples |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>293</b>.</FONT></span> he said unto them: "Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Mary interpreteth from former sayings.</FONT></span>And Mary again started forward and said: "Yea, my Lord, I understand in what manner thou dost discourse with me, and I will comprehend them all [<i>sc.</i> thy words]. Now, therefore,</p>  
<p>concerning these words which thou sayest, my mind hath brought forward four thoughts in me and my light-man hath led me and exulted and seethed, desiring to come forth out of me and enter into thee. Now, therefore, my Lord, hearken that I may tell thee the four thoughts which have arisen in me.</p>  
<p>"The first thought hath arisen in me concerning the word which thou hast spoken: 'Now, therefore, the soul giveth the apology and seal unto all the rulers who are in the region of the king, the Adamas, and giveth the apology and the honour and the glory of all their seals and the songs of praise to the region of the Light,'--concerning this word then thou hast spoken unto us aforetime, when they brought thee the piece of<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The piece of money which was brought unto Jesus.</FONT></span> money and thou didst see that it was of silver and copper and didst ask: 'Whose is this image?' They said: 'The king's.' And when thou sawest that it was of silver and copper mixed, thou saidst: 'Give therefore the king's unto the king and God's unto God,'--that is: If the soul receiveth mysteries, it giveth the apology to</p>  
<p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></A></p>  
<p>all the rulers and to the region |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>294</b>.</FONT></span> of the king, the Adamas; and the soul giveth the honour and the glory to all those of the region of the Light. And the word: 'It hath glistened, when thou didst see that it is made up of silver and copper,'--it is the type thereof, that in it [<i>sc.</i> the soul] is the power of the Light, which is the refined silver, and that in it is the counterfeiting spirit, which is the material copper. This, my Lord, is the first thought.</p>  
<p>"The second thought is on the other hand that which thou hast just said unto us concerning the soul which receiveth the mysteries: 'If it cometh into the region of the rulers of the way of the midst, they come forth to meet it in exceedingly great fear and they are afraid of it. And the soul giveth the mystery of the fear unto them and they are afraid before it. And it giveth the destiny to its region, and it giveth the counterfeiting spirit to its own region, and it giveth the apology and the seals to every one of the rulers who are on the ways, and it giveth the honour and the glory and the laud of the seals and the songs of praise to all those of the region of the Light,'--concerning this word, my Lord, thou hast spoken aforetime through the mouth of our brother<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">A saying of Paul.</FONT></span> Paul: 'Give tax to whom tax is due, give fear to whom fear is due, give tribute to whom tribute is due, give honour to whom honour is due, and give laud to whom laud is due, and owe not any other anything,' |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>295</b>.</FONT></span>--that is, my Lord: The soul which receiveth mysteries, giveth apology to all regions. This, my Lord, is the second thought.</p>  
<p>"The third thought on the other hand concerning the word which thou hast aforetime spoken</p>  
<p><a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="green">p. 245</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The foes of one's own house.</FONT></span>unto us: 'The counterfeiting spirit is hostile to the soul, making it do all sins and all mischiefs, and it transferreth it in the chastisements because of all the . sins which it hath made it commit; in a word, it is hostile to the soul in every way,'--concerning this word, therefore, thou hast said unto us aforetime: 'The foes of the man are the dwellers in his house,'--that is: The dwellers in the house of the soul are the counterfeiting spirit and the destiny, which are hostile to the soul the whole time, making it commit all sin and all iniquities. Lo this, my Lord, is the third thought.</p>  
<p>"The fourth thought on the other hand concerning the word which thou hast said: 'If the soul goeth forth out of the body and travelleth on the way with the counterfeiting spirit, and if it hath not found the mystery of the undoing of all the bonds and the seals which are bound to the counterfeiting spirit, so that it may cease to haunt or be assigned to it,--if it then hath not found it, the counterfeiting spirit leadeth the soul to the Virgin of Light, the judge; and the judge, the Virgin of Light, proveth the soul and findeth |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>296</b>.</FONT></span> that it hath sinned and, as she also hath not found the mysteries of the Light with it, she handeth it over to one of her receivers, and her receiver leadeth it and casteth it into the body, and it cometh not out of the changes of the body before it hath yielded its last circuit,'--concerning this word, then, my Lord, thou hast said unto us aforetime: 'Be reconciled with thy foe as long<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">A former saying concerning rebirth.</FONT></span> as thou art on the way with him, lest perchance thy foe hand thee over to the judge and the judge hand thee over to the servant and the servant</p>  
<p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></A></p>  
<p>cast thee into prison, and thou shalt not come forth out of that region till thou hast yielded the last farthing.'</p>  
<p>"Because of this manifestly is thy word: Every soul which cometh forth out of the body and travelleth on the way with the counterfeiting spirit and findeth not the mystery of the undoing of all the seals and all the bonds, so that it may undo itself from the counterfeiting spirit which is bound to it,--that soul which hath not found mysteries of the Light and hath not found the mysteries of detachment from the counterfeiting spirit which is bound to it,--if then it hath not found it, the counterfeiting spirit leadeth that soul to the Virgin of Light, and the Virgin of Light, yea that judge, handeth over that soul |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>297</b>.</FONT></span> to one of her receivers, and her receiver casteth it into the sphere of the &aelig;ons, and it cometh not out of the changes of the body before it hath yielded the last circuit which is appointed for it. This then, my Lord, is the fourth thought."</p>
