<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">He entereth the &aelig;ons.</FONT></span>"And I left that region behind me and ascended to the great &aelig;ons of the rulers and came before their veils and their gates, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light which was about me. It came to pass then, when I arrived at the twelve &aelig;ons, that their veils and their gates were shaken one over against the other. Their veils drew themselves apart of their own accord, and their gates opened one</p>

<p>over against the other. And I entered into the &aelig;ons, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light that was about me, forty-and-nine times more than the light with which I shone in the houses of the Fate.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The powers of the &aelig;ons are amazed and fall down and adore him.</FONT></span>"And all the angels of the &aelig;ons and their archangels and their rulers and their gods and their lords and their authorities and their tyrants and their powers and their light-sparks and their light-givers and their unpaired and their invisibles and their forefathers and their triple-powers saw me, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light which was about me. And they were thrown into agitation the one over against the other and great fear fell upon them, when they saw the great light that was about me. And in their great agitation and their great fear they withdrew as far as |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>24</b>.</FONT></span> the region of the great invisible Forefather, and of the three great triple-powers. And because of the great fear of their agitation, the great Forefather, he and the three triple-powers, kept on running hither and thither in his region, and they could not close all their regions because of the great fear in which they were. And they agitated all their &aelig;ons together and all their spheres and all their orders, fearing and being greatly agitated because of the great light which was about me--not of the former quality that it was about me when I was on the earth of man-kind, when the light-vesture came over me,--for the world could not bear the light such as it was in its truth, else would the world at once be destroyed and all upon it,--but the light which was about me in the twelve &aelig;ons was</p>

<p>eight-thousand-and-seven-hundred-myriad times greater than that which was about me in the world among you.</p>
