<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jesus trieth Peter.</FONT></span>Thereafter Jesus saw a woman who came to make repentance. |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>312</b>.</FONT></span> He had baptized her three times, and yet she had not done what was worthy of the baptisms. And the Saviour desired to try Peter, to see if he was compassionate and forgiving, as he had commanded them. He said unto Peter: "Lo, three times have I baptized this soul, and yet at this third time she hath not done what is worthy of the mysteries of the Light. Wherefor then cloth she make her body good for nothing? Now, therefore, Peter, perform the mystery which cutteth off the souls from the inheritances of the Light; perform that mystery in order that it may cut off the soul of this woman from the Inheritance of the Light."</p>  
<p>When then the Saviour had said this, he tried [Peter] to see whether he was compassionate and forgiving.</p>  
<p>When then the Saviour had said this, Peter</p>  
<p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="green">p. 259</font></A></p>  
<p>said: "My Lord, let her yet this time, that we may give her the higher mysteries; and if she is fit, then hast thou let her inherit the Light-kingdom, but if she is not fit, then hast thou [to] cut her off from the Light-kingdom."</p>  
<p>When then Peter had said this, the Saviour knew that Peter was compassionate as he and forgiving.</p>  
<p>When then all this was said, the Saviour said unto his disciples: "Have ye understood all these words and the type |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>313</b>.</FONT></span> of this woman?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Mary interpreteth the incident from a former saying.</FONT></span>Mary answered and said: "My Lord, I have understood the mysteries of the things which have fallen to this woman's lot. Concerning the things then which have fallen to her lot, thou hast spoken unto us aforetime in similitude, saying: 'A man owned a fig-tree in his vineyard; and he came to look for its fruit, and he found not a single one on it. He said to the vine-dresser: Lo, three years do I come to look for fruit on this fig-tree, and I have not any produce at all from it. Cut it down then; why doth it make the ground also good for nothing? But he answered and said unto him: My lord, have patience with it still this year, until I dig round it and give it dung; and if it beareth in another year, thou hast let it, but if thou dost not find any [fruit] at all, then hast thou [to] cut it down.' Lo, my Lord, this is the solution of the word."</p>  
<p>The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Well said, spiritual [one]. This is [the solution of] the word."</p>
