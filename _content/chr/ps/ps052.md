### CHAPTER 48

<span class="margnote">The emanations of Self-willed cease for a time to
oppress Sophia.</span>When then Jesus had said this unto his disciples,
he answered again and said unto them: "It came to pass then, when the
lion-faced power had noticed that Pistis Sophia had not been led up
altogether out of the chaos, \|<span class="rmargnote">**85**.</span>
that it came again with all the other material emanations of
Self-willed, and they oppressed Pistis Sophia again. It came to pass
then, when they oppressed her, that she cried out in the same
repentance, saying:

<span class="margnote">She continueth her repentance.</span>"'9. Have
mercy upon me, O Light, for they have oppressed me again. Because of thy
commandment, the light in me is distracted and my power and my
understanding.

"'10. My power hath begun to wane whiles I am in these afflictions, and
the number of my time whiles I am in the chaos. My light is diminished,
for they have taken away my power from me, and all the powers in me are
tossed about.

"'11. I am become powerless in the presence of all the rulers of the
æons, who hate me, and in the presence of the four-and-twenty
emanations, in whose region I was. And my brother, my

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

pair, was afraid to help me, because of that in which they have set me.

"'12. And all the rulers of the height have counted me as matter in
which is no light. I am become as a material power which hath fallen out
of the rulers,

"'13. And all who are in the æons said: She hath become chaos. And
thereafter all the pitiless powers encompassed me together and proposed
to take away the whole light in me.

"'14. But I have trusted in thee, O Light, and said: Thou art my
saviour.

"'15. And my commandment, which thou hast decreed for me, is in thy
hands. Save me out of the hands of the emanations of Self-willed, which
oppress me and persecute me.

"'16. Send thy light over me, for I am as naught before thee, \|<span
class="rmargnote">**86**.</span> and save me according to thy
compassion.

"'17. Let me not be despised, for I have sung praises unto thee, O
Light. Let chaos cover the emanations of Self-willed, let them be led
down into the darkness.

"'18. Let the mouth of them be shut up, who would devour me with guile,
who say: Let us take the whole light in her,--although I have done them
no ill.'"
