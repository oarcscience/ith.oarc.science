<p>Mary answered and said unto the Saviour: "My Lord, before thou didst come to the region of the rulers and before thou didst come down into the world, hath no soul entered into the Light?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">No soul had entered into the Light before the coming of the First Mystery.</FONT></span>The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Am&#275;n, am&#275;n, I say unto you Before I did come into the world, no soul hath entered into the Light. And now, therefore, when I am come, I have opened the gates of the Light and opened the ways which lead to the Light. And now, therefore, let him who shall do what is worthy of the mysteries, receive the mysteries and enter into the Light."</p>  
<p>Mary continued and said: "But, my Lord, I have heard that the prophets have entered into the Light."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the prophets.</FONT></span>The Saviour continued and said unto Mary: "Am&#275;n, am&#275;n, I say unto you: No prophet hath entered into the Light; but the rulers of the &aelig;ons have discoursed with them out of the &aelig;ons and given them the mystery of the &aelig;ons. And when I came to the regions of the &aelig;ons, I have turned Elias and sent him into the body of John the Baptizer, and the rest also I turned into righteous bodies, which will find the mysteries |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>356</b>.</FONT></span> of the Light, go on high and inherit the Light-kingdom.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the patriarchs.</FONT></span>"Unto Abraham on the other hand and Isaac and Jacob I have forgiven all their sins and their iniquities and have given them the mysteries of the Light in the &aelig;ons and placed them in the region of Yabra&#333;th and of all the rulers who have repented. And when I go into the Height and</p>  
<p><a name="page_294"><font size="1" color="green">p. 294</font></A></p>  
<p>am on the point of going into the Light, I will carry their souls with me into the Light. But, am&#275;n, I say unto you, Mary: They will not go into the Light before I have carried thy soul and those of all thy brethren into the Light.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the souls of the righteous from Adam to Jesus.</FONT></span>"The rest of the patriarchs and of the righteous from the time of Adam unto now, who are in the &aelig;ons and all the orders of the rulers, when I came to the region of the &aelig;ons, I have through the Virgin of Light made to turn into bodies which will all be righteous,--those which will find the mysteries of the Light, enter in and inherit the Light-kingdom."</p>  
<p>Mary answered and said: "Blessed are we before all men because of these splendours which thou hast revealed unto us."</p>  
<p>The Saviour answered and said unto Mary and all the disciples: "I will still reveal unto you all the splendours of the Height, from the interiors of the interiors to the exteriors of the exteriors, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>357</b>.</FONT></span> that ye may be perfected in all gnosis and in all fulness and in the height of the heights and the depths of the depths."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The disciples know of a surety that Jesus is the Great Initiator.</FONT></span>And Mary continued and said to the Saviour: "Lo, my Lord, we have openly, exactly and clearly known that thou hast brought the keys of the mysteries of the Light-kingdom, which forgive souls sins and purify them and make them into refined light and lead them into the Light."</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">[SUB-SCRIPTION:]</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">A PORTION OF THE BOOKS OF THE SAVIOUR</h3>
