### CHAPTER 26

"This then they accomplished continuously before their power was
diminished in them and they waned and became exhausted, or powerless. It
came to pass then, when they became powerless, that their power began to
cease in them, so that they became exhausted in their power, and their
light, which was in their region, ceased and their kingdom was
destroyed, and the universe became quickly raised up.

"It came to pass then, when they had perceived this at the time, and
when the number of the cipher of Melchisedec, the Receiver \[of the
Light\], happened, then had he to come out again and enter into the
midst of the rulers of all the æons and into the midst of all the rulers
of the Fate and of those of the sphere; and he threw them into
agitation, and made them quickly abandon

their circles. And forthwith they were constrained, and cast forth the
power out of themselves, out of the breath of their mouth and the tears
of their eyes and the sweat of their bodies.

<span class="margnote">The rulers devour their matter so that souls may
not be fashioned.</span>"And Melchisedec, the Receiver of the Light,
purifieth them, as he doth continually; he carrieth their light into the
Treasury of the Light. And all the rulers of the æons and the rulers of
the Fate and those of the sphere turn to the matter of their refuse;
they devour it and do not let it go and become souls in the world. They
devour then their matter, so that they may not become powerless and
exhausted and their power cease in them and their kingdom become
destroyed, but in order that they may delay and linger a long time until
the completion of the number of the perfect souls who shall be in the
Treasury of the Light.
