<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Mary desireth to hear the story of Sophia.</FONT></span>It came to pass then, when Jesus had said this unto his disciples, that Mary came forward and said: "My Lord, I have heard thee say aforetime: 'Pistis Sophia is herself one of the f our-and-twenty emanations, how then is she not in their region? |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>44</b>.</FONT></span> But thou hast said: 'I found her below the thirteenth &aelig;on.'"</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">[THE STORY OF PISTIS SOPHIA]</h3>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Sophia desireth to enter the Light-world.</FONT></span>And Jesus answered and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass, when Pistis Sophia was in the thirteenth &aelig;on, in the region of all her brethren the invisibles, that is the four-and-twenty emanations of the great Invisible,--it came to pass then by command of the First Mystery that Pistis Sophia gazed into the height. She saw the light of the veil of the Treasury of the Light, and she</p>

<p>longed to reach to that region, and she could not reach to that region. But she ceased to perform the mystery of the thirteenth &aelig;on, and sang praises to the light of the height, which she had seen in the light of the veil of the Treasury of the Light.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The rulers hate her for ceasing in their mystery.</FONT></span>"It came to pass then, when she sang praises to the region of the height, that all the rulers in the twelve &aelig;ons, who are below, hated her, because she had ceased from their mysteries, and because she had desired to go into the height and be above them all. For this cause then they were enraged against her and hated her, [as did] the great triple-powered Self-willed, that is the third triple-power, who is in the thirteenth &aelig;on, he who had become disobedient, in as much as he had not emanated the whole purification of his power in him, and had not given the purification of his light at the time when the rulers gave their purification, in that he desired to rule over the whole thirteenth &aelig;on |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>45</b>.</FONT></span> and those who are below it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Self-willed uniteth himself with the rulers of the twelve &aelig;ons and emanateth a lion-faced power to plague Sophia.</FONT></span>"It came to pass then, when the rulers of the twelve &aelig;ons were enraged against Pistis Sophia, who is above them, and hated her exceedingly, that the great triple-powered Self-willed, of whom I have just now told you, joined himself to the rulers of the twelve &aelig;ons, and also was enraged against Pistis Sophia and hated her exceedingly, because she had thought to go to the light which is higher than her. And he emanated out of himself a great lion-faced power, and out of his matter in him he emanated a host of other very violent material emanations, and sent them into the regions below, to the parts of the chaos, in order that they might there lie in wait for Pistis</p>

And the rulers who abide, or persist, in performing the mystery, hated her, and all the guards who are at the gates of the &aelig;ons, hated her also.</p>  
<p>"It came to pass then thereafter by command of the First Commandment that the great triple-powered Self-willed, who is one of the three |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>46</b>.</FONT></span> triple-powers, pursued Sophia in the thirteenth &aelig;on, in order that she should look towards the parts below, so that she might see in that region his lion-faced light-power and long after it and go to that region, so that her light might be taken from her.</p>
