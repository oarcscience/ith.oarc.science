<p>And Jesus continued again and said unto his disciples: "Still further, O my disciples, be</p>  
<p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="green">p. 181</font></A></p>  
<p>sober and let every one of you bring hither the power of sensing the Light before him, that ye may sense with sureness. For from now on I will discourse with you concerning the whole region in truth of the Ineffable and concerning the manner, how it is."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The disciples lose courage.</FONT></span>It came to pass then, when the disciples had heard Jesus utter these words, that they gave way and let go entirely.</p>  
<p>Then Mary Magdalene came forward, threw herself at the feet of Jesus, kissed them and wept aloud and said: "Have mercy upon me, my Lord, for my brethren have heard and let go of the words which thou saidest unto them. Now, therefore, my Lord, concerning the gnosis of all the things which thou hast said, that they are in the mystery |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>217</b>.</FONT></span> of the Ineffable; but I have heard thee say unto me: 'From now on I will begin to discourse with you concerning the total gnosis of the mystery of the Ineffable,'--this word, therefore, which thou saidest, thou hast not gone forward to complete the word. For this cause, therefore, my brethren have heard and have let go and ceased to sense in what manner thou discoursest with them. Concerning the word which thou saidest unto them, now, therefore, my Lord, if the gnosis of all this is in that mystery, where is the man who is in the world, who hath the ability to understand that mystery with all its gnoses and the type of all these words which thou hast spoken concerning it?"</p>
