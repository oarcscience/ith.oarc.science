<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The commandment of the First Mystery is fulfilled for taking Sophia entirely out of the chaos.</FONT></span>And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass when Pistis Sophia had uttered the thirteenth repentance,--in that hour was fulfilled the commandment of all the tribulations which were de-creed for Pistis Sophia for the fulfilment of the First Mystery, which was from the beginning, and the time had come to save her out of the chaos and lead her out from all the darknesses. For her repentance was accepted from her through the First Mystery; and that mystery sent me a great light-power out of the height, that I might help Pistis Sophia |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>118</b>.</FONT></span> and lead her up out of the chaos. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The First Mystery and Jesus sent forth two light-powers to help Sophia.</FONT></span>So I looked towards the &aelig;ons into the height and saw that light-power which the First Mystery had sent me, that I might save Pistis Sophia out of the chaos. It came to pass, therefore, when I had seen it, coming forth from the &aelig;ons and hastening down to me,--I was above</p>  
<p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></A></p>  
<p>the chaos,--that another light-power went forth out of me, that it too might help Pistis Sophia. And the light-power which had come from the height through the First Mystery, came down upon the light-power which had gone out of me; and they met together and became a great stream of light."</p>  
<p>When then Jesus had said this unto his disciples, he said: "Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Mary Magdalene interpreteth the mystery from Psalm lxxxiv.</FONT></span>Mary started forward again and said: "My Lord, I understand what thou sayest. Concerning the solution of this word thy light-power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the eighty-fourth Psalm, saying:</p>  
<p>"'10. Grace and truth met together, and righteousness and peace kissed each other.</p>  
<p>"'11. Truth sprouted forth out of the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven.'</p>  
<p>"'Grace' then is the light-power which hath come down through the First Mystery; for the First Mystery hath hearkened unto Pistis Sophia and hath had |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>119</b>.</FONT></span> mercy on her in all her tribulations. 'Truth' on the other hand is the power which hath gone forth out of thee, for that thou hast fulfilled the truth, in order to save her out of the chaos. And 'righteousness' again is the power which hath come forth through the First Mystery, which will guide Pistis Sophia. And 'peace' again is the power which hath gone forth out of thee, so that it should enter into the emanations of Self-willed and take from them the lights which they have taken away from Pistis Sophia, that is, so that thou mayest gather them together into Pistis Sophia and make them at peace with</p>  
<p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></A></p>  
<p>her power. 'Truth' on the other hand is the power which went forth out of thee, when thou wast in the lower regions of the chaos. For this cause thy power hath said through David</p>  
<p>'Truth sprouted out of the earth,' because thou wert in the lower regions of the chaos. 'Righteousness' on the other hand which hath 'looked down from heaven,'--it is the power which hath come down from the height through the First Mystery and hath entered into Pistis Sophia."</p>
