<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The mystery of the five words on the vesture.</FONT></span>"It came to pass then, when the sun had risen in the east, that a great light-power came down, in which was my Vesture, which I had left behind in the four-and-twentieth mystery, as I have said unto you. And I found a mystery in my Vesture, written in five words of those from the height: <i>zama&nbsp;zama &#333;zza rachama &#333;zai</i>,--whose solution is this:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The solution thereof.</FONT></span>"'O Mystery, which is without in the world, for whose sake the universe hath arisen,--this is the total outgoing and the total ascent, which hath emanated all emanations and all that is</p>  
<p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></A></p>  
<p>therein and for whose sake all mysteries and all their regions have arisen,--come hither unto us, for we are thy fellow-members. We are all with thyself; we are one and the same. Thou art the First Mystery, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>17</b>.</FONT></span> which existed from 1 the beginning in the Ineffable before it came forth; and the name thereof are we all. Now, therefore, are we all come to meet thee at the last limit, which also is the last mystery from within; itself is a portion of us. Now, therefore, have we sent thee thy Vesture, which hath belonged to thee from the beginning, which thou hast left behind in the last limit, which also is the last mystery from within, until its time should be completed, according to the commandment of the First Mystery. Lo, its time is completed; put it on [thee].</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The three robes of light.</FONT></span>"'Come unto us, for we all draw nigh to thee to clothe thee with the First Mystery and all his glory, by commandment of himself, in that the First Mystery hath given us it, consisting of two vestures, to clothe thee therewith, besides the one which we have sent thee, for thou art worthy of them, since thou art prior to us, and existeth before us. For this cause, therefore, hath the First Mystery sent thee through us the mystery of all his glory, consisting of two vestures.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The first vesture.</FONT></span>"'In the first is the whole glory of all the names of all mysteries and all emanations of the orders |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>18</b>.</FONT></span> of the spaces of the Ineffable.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The second vesture.</FONT></span>"'And in the second vesture is the whole glory of the name of all mysteries and all emanations which are in the orders of the two spaces of the First Mystery.</p>  
<p>"And in this [third] vesture, which we have</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The third vesture.</FONT></span>just sent thee, is the glory of the name of the mystery of the Revealer, which is the First Commandment, and of the mystery of the five Impressions, and of the mystery of the great Envoy of the Ineffable, who is the great Light, and of the mystery of the five Leaders, who are the five Helpers. There is further in this vesture the glory of the name of the mystery of all orders of the emanations of the Treasury of the Light and of their saviours, and [of the mystery] of the orders of the orders, which are the seven Am&#275;ns and the seven Voices and the five Trees and the three Am&#275;ns and the Twin-saviour, that is the Child of the Child, and of the mystery of the nine guards of the three gates of the Treasury of the Light. There is further therein the whole glory of the name [of all those] which are in the Right, and of all those which are in the Midst. And further there is therein the whole glory of the name of the great Invisible, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>19</b>.</FONT></span> which is the great Forefather, and the mystery of the three triple-powers and the mystery of their whole region and the mystery of all their invisibles and of all those who are in the thirteenth &aelig;on, and the name of the twelve &aelig;ons and of all their rulers and all their archangels and all their angels and of all those who are in the twelve &aelig;ons, and the whole mystery of the name of all those who are in the Fate and in all the heavens, and the whole mystery of the name of all those who are in the sphere, and of its firmaments and of all who are in them, and of all their regions.</p>  
<p>"'Lo, therefore, we have sent thee this vesture, which no one knew from the First Commandment</p>

Haste thee, therefore, clothe thyself with this vesture and come unto us. For we draw nigh unto thee, to clothe thee by command of the First Mystery with thy two vestures [other] which existed for thee from the beginning with the First Mystery until the time appointed by the Ineffable is completed. |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>20</b>.</FONT></span> Come, therefore, to us quickly, that we may put them on thee, until thou hast fulfilled the total ministry of the perfection of the First Mystery which is appointed by the Ineffable. Come, therefore, to us quickly, in order that we may clothe thee with them, according to the command of the First Mystery. For yet a little while, a very little while, and thou shalt come unto us and leave the world. Come, therefore, quickly, that thou mayest receive thy whole glory, that is the glory of the First Mystery.'</p>
