<p>AND Mary continued again and said unto Jesus: "In what type is the outer darkness; or rather how many regions of chastisement are there in it?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the dragon of the outer darkness.</FONT></span>And Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "The outer darkness is a great dragon, whose tail is in his mouth, outside the whole world and surrounding the whole world. And there are many regions of chastisement within it. There are twelve mighty |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>320</b>.</FONT></span> chastisement-dungeons and a ruler is in every dungeon and the face of the rulers is different one from another.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the rulers of the twelve dungeons and their names.</FONT></span>"And the first ruler, who is in the first dungeon, hath a crocodile's face, whose tail is in his mouth. And out of the jaws of the dragon cometh all ice and all dust and all cold and all different diseases. This [is] he who is called with his authentic name in his region 'Enchthonin.'</p>  
<p>"And the ruler who is in the second dungeon,--a cat's face is his authentic face. This [is] he who is called in his region 'Charachar.'</p>  
<p>"And the ruler who is in the third dungeon,--a dog's face is his authentic face. This [is] he who is called in his region 'Archar&#333;ch.'</p>  
<p>"And the ruler who is in the fourth dungeon,--a serpent's face is his authentic face. This [is] he who is called in his region 'Achr&#333;char.'</p>

<p>"And the ruler who is in the fifth dungeon,--a black bull's face is his authentic face. This [is] he who is called in his region 'March&#363;r.'</p>  
<p>"And the ruler who is in the sixth dungeon,--a wild boar's face is his authentic face. This [is] he who is called in his region 'Lamcham&#333;r.'</p>  
<p>"And the ruler who is in the seventh dungeon, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>321</b>.</FONT></span>--a bear's face is his authentic face. This [is] he who is called in his region with his authentic name 'Luchar.'</p>  
<p>"And the ruler of the eighth dungeon,--a vulture's face is his authentic face, whose name in his region is called 'Lara&#333;ch.'</p>  
<p>"And the ruler of the ninth dungeon,--a basilisk's face is his authentic face, whose name in his region is called 'Arche&#333;ch.'</p>  
<p>"And in the tenth dungeon is a multitude of rulers, and every one of them hath seven dragon's heads in his authentic face. And he who is over them all is in his region with his name called Xarmar&#333;ch.'</p>  
<p>"And in the eleventh dungeon is a multitude of rulers,--and every one of them hath seven cat-faced heads in his authentic face. And the great one over them is called in his region R&#333;char.'</p>  
<p>"And in the twelfth dungeon is an exceedingly great multitude of rulers, and every one of them hath seven dog-faced heads in his authentic face. And the great one over them is called in his region 'Chr&#275;ma&#333;r.'</p>  
<p>"These rulers then of these twelve dungeons are inside the dragon of the outer darkness, each and every one |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>322</b>.</FONT></span> of them hath a name every hour, and every one of them changeth his face every</p>

And moreover every one of these dungeons hath a door opening upwards, so that the dragon of the outer darkness hath twelve dark dungeons, and every dungeon hath a door opening upwards. And an angel of the height watcheth each of the doors of the dungeons,--whom Yew, the First Man, the overseer of the Light,<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The angels who watch the doors.</FONT></span> the envoy of the First Commandment, hath established as watchers of the dragon, so that the dragon and the rulers of his dungeons which are in him, may not mutiny."</p>
