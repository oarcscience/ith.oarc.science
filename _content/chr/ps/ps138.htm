<p>Mary answered and said: "To all men then who are in the world, will all which is appointed them through the Fate, whether good or bad or sin or death or life,--in a word, will all which is appointed them through the rulers of the Fate, have to come unto them?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">There is no escape from the destiny.</FONT></span>The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Am&#275;n, I say unto you: All which is appointed unto every one through the Fate, whether all good or all sins,--in a word, all which is appointed them, cometh unto them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the keys of the mysteries.</FONT></span>"For this cause, therefore, have I brought |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>351</b>.</FONT></span> the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; otherwise no flesh in the world would be saved. For without mysteries no one will enter into the Light-kingdom, be he a righteous or a sinner.</p>  
<p>"For this cause, therefore, have I brought the keys of the mysteries into the world, that I may free the sinners who shall have faith in me and hearken unto me, so that I may free them from the bonds and the seals of the &aelig;ons of the rulers and bind them to the seals and the vestures and the orders of the Light, in order that he whom I shall free in the world from the bonds and the seals of the &aelig;ons of the rulers, may be freed in the Height from the bonds and seals of the &aelig;ons of the rulers, and in order that he whom I</p>  
<p><a name="page_290"><font size="1" color="green">p. 290</font></A></p>  
<p>shall bind in the world to the seals and the vestures and the orders of the Light, may be bound in the Light-land to the orders of the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
<p>"For the sake of sinners, therefore, have I torn myself asunder at this time and have brought them the mysteries, that I may free them from the &aelig;ons of the rulers and bind them to the inheritances of the Light, and not only the sinners, but also the righteous, in order that I may give them the mysteries and that they may be taken into the Light, for without mysteries they cannot |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>352</b>.</FONT></span> be taken into the Light.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The mysteries are for all men.</FONT></span>"For this cause, therefore, I have not hidden it, but I have cried it aloud clearly. And I have not separated the sinners, but I have cried it aloud and said it unto all men, unto sinners and righteous, saying: 'Seek that ye may find, knock that it may be opened unto you; for every one who seeketh in truth, will find, and who knocketh, to him it will be opened.' For I have said unto all men: They are to seek the mysteries of the Light-kingdom which shall purify them and make them refined and lead them into the Light.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">A prophecy of John the Baptizer.</FONT></span>"For this cause, therefore, hath John the Baptizer prophesied concerning me, saying: 'I indeed have baptized you with water unto repentance for forgiveness of your sins. He who cometh after me, is stronger than me. Whose fan is in his hand, and he will purify his floor. The chaff indeed he will consume with unquenchable fire, but the wheat he will gather into his barn.' The power in John hath prophesied concerning me, knowing that I would bring the mysteries into the world and purify the sins of</p>

<p>the sinners who shall have faith in me and hearken unto me, and make them into refined light and lead them into the Light."</p>
