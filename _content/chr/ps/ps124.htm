<p>Mary continued again and said: "My Lord, but if on the other hand they who have received the mysteries of the First Mystery, turn and transgress, and if they come out of the body before they have repented, will they inherit the kingdom or not, because indeed they have received the gift of the First Mystery?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of such initiated who sin and die without repentance.</FONT></span>The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Am&#275;n, am&#275;n, I say unto you: Every man who hath received mysteries in the First Mystery, | having transgressed for the first and the second and the third time, and if he cometh out of the body before he hath repented, his judgment is far sorer than all the judgments; for his dwelling is in the midst of the jaws of the dragon of the outer darkness, and at the end of all this he will be frozen up [?] in the chastisements and perish for ever, because he hath received the gift of the First Mystery and hath not abided in it [<i>sc.</i> the gift].</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the unending forgiveness of those who have received the mystery of the Ineffable.</FONT></span>Mary answered and said: "My Lord, all men who shall receive the mysteries of the mystery of the Ineffable, and have turned again, have transgressed and have ceased in their faith, and again thereafter, when they are still in life,</p>

<p>have turned and have repented, how many times will it be forgiven them?"</p>  
<p>The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Am&#275;n, am&#275;n, I say unto you: To every man who shall receive the mysteries of the Ineffable, not only if he transgresseth once, turneth again and repenteth, will it be forgiven, but if at any time he transgresseth, and if, when still in life, he turneth again and repenteth, without play- acting, and again if he turneth and repenteth and prayeth in any of his mysteries, then will it be forgiven him, because he hath received of the gift of the mysteries of |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>307</b>.</FONT></span> the Ineffable, and moreover because those mysteries are compassionate and forgive at every time."</p>  
<p>And Mary answered again and said unto Jesus: "My Lord, those who shall receive the mysteries of the Ineffable, and have again turned, have transgressed and have ceased in their faith and are moreover come out of the body before they have repented, what will befall such?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of such initiated who sin and die without repentance.</FONT></span>And the Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Am&#275;n, am&#275;n, I say unto you: All men who shall receive the mysteries of the Ineffable, blessed indeed are the souls which shall receive of those mysteries; but if they turn and transgress and come out of the body before they have repented, the judgment of those men is sorer than all the judgments, and it is exceedingly violent, even if those souls are new and it is their first time for coming into the world. They will not return to the changes of the bodies from that hour onwards and will not be able to do anything, but they will be cast out into the outer</p>
