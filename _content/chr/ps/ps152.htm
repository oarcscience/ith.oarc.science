<p>Bartholomew said: "A man who hath intercourse with a male, what is his vengeance?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the chastisement of him who hath intercourse with males.</FONT></span>Jesus said: "The measure of the man who hath intercourse with males and of the man with whom he lieth, is the same as that of the blasphemer.</p>  
<p>"When then the time is completed through the sphere, the receivers of Yaldaba&#333;th come after their soul, and he with his forty-and-nine demons taketh vengeance on it eleven years.</p>  
<p>"Thereafter they carry it to the fire-rivers and seething pitch-seas, which are full of demons with pigs' faces. They eat into them and take vengeance on [?] them in the fire-rivers another eleven years.</p>  
<p>"Thereafter they carry them into the outer darkness until the day of judgment when the great darkness is judged; and then they will be dissolved and destroyed."</p>  
<p>Thomas said: "We have heard that there are some on the earth who take the male seed and the female monthly blood, and make it into a lentil porridge and eat it, |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>387</b>.</FONT></span> saying: 'We have faith in Esau and Jacob.' Is this then seemly or not?"</p>  
<p>Jesus was wroth with the world in that hour</p>  
<p><a name="page_322"><font size="1" color="green">p. 322</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the chastisement of a foul act of sorcery.</FONT></span>and said unto Thomas: "Am&#275;n, I say: This sin is more heinous than all sins and iniquities. Such men will straightway be taken into the outer darkness and not be cast back anew into the sphere, but they shall perish, be destroyed in the outer darkness in a region where there is neither pity nor light, but howling and grinding of teeth. And all the souls which shall be brought into the outer darkness, will not be cast back anew, but will be destroyed and dissolved."</p>  
<p>John answered [and said]: "A man who hath committed no sin, but done good persistently, but hath not found the mysteries to pass through the rulers, when he cometh out of the body, what will happen unto him?"</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the after-death state of the righteous man who path not been initiated.</FONT></span>Jesus said: "If the time of such an one is completed through the sphere, the receivers of Bainch&#333;&#333;&#333;ch, who is one of the triple-powered gods, come after his soul and lead his soul with joy and exultation and spend three days circling round with it and instructing it concerning the creations of the world with joy and exultation.</p>  
<p>"Thereafter they lead it down into the Amente and instruct it concerning the instruments of chastisement in the Amente; but they will not take vengeance on it therewith. But they will only instruct it concerning them, and the smoke of the flame of the chastisements catcheth it only a little.</p>  
<p>"Thereafter they carry it up unto the way of the midst and instruct it concerning the chastisements of the ways of the midst, the smoke from the flame catching it a little.</p>  
<p>"Thereafter they lead it unto the Virgin of Light, and she judgeth it and depositeth it with</p>  
<p><a name="page_323"><font size="1" color="green">p. 323</font></A></p>  
<p>the little Saba&#333;th, the Good, him of the Midst, until the sphere turneth itself, and Zeus and Aphrodite come in face of the Virgin of Light, while Kronos and Ar&#275;s come behind her.</p>  
<p>"At that hour she taketh that righteous soul and handeth it over to her receivers, that they may cast it into the peons of the sphere. And the servitors of the sphere lead it forth into a water which is below the sphere; and a seething fire ariseth and eateth into it until it purifieth it utterly.</p>  
<p>"Thereafter cometh Yaluham, the receiver of Saba&#333;th, the Adamas, who giveth the cup of forgetfulness unto the souls, and he bringeth the water of forgetfulness and handeth it to the soul; [and it drinketh it] and forgetteth all things and all the regions to which it had gone.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the cup of wisdom.</FONT></span>"Thereafter there cometh a receiver of the little Saba&#333;th, the Good, him of the Midst. He himself bringeth a cup filled with thoughts and wisdom, and soberness is in it; [and] he handeth it to the soul. And they cast it into a body which can neither sleep nor forget because of the cup of soberness which hath been handed unto it; but |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>389</b>.</FONT></span> it will whip its heart persistently to question about the mysteries of the Light until it find them, through the decision of the Virgin of Light, and inherit the Light for ever."</p>
