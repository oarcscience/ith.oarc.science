<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of three other mystic rites.</FONT></span>Thereafter his disciples said unto him: "Rabbi, reveal unto us the mystery of the Light of thy father, since we heard thee say: 'There is still a fire-baptism and there is still a baptism of the holy spirit of the Light, and there is |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>378</b>.</FONT></span> a spiritual chrism; these lead the souls into the Treasury of the Light.' Tell us, therefore, their mystery, so that we ourselves may inherit the kingdom of thy father."</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the highest mysteries and of the great name.</FONT></span>Jesus said unto them: "There is no mystery which is more excellent than these mysteries on which ye question, in that it will lead your souls into the Light of the lights, into the regions of Truth and Goodness, into the region of the Holy of all holies, into the region in which there is neither female nor male, nor are there forms in that region, but a perpetual indescribable Light. Nothing more excellent is there, therefore, than these mysteries on which ye question, save only the mystery of the seven Voices and their nine-and-forty powers and their ciphers. And there is no name which is more excellent than them all, the name in which are all names and all lights and all powers.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Of the efficacy of that name.</FONT></span>"Who then knoweth that name, if he cometh out of the body of matter, nor smoke nor darkness nor authority nor ruler of the Fate-sphere nor angel nor archangel nor power can hold down the soul which knoweth that name; but if it cometh out of the world and sayeth that name to the fire, it is quenched and the darkness withdraweth.</p>  
<p>"And if it sayeth it to the demons |<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>379</b>.</FONT></span> and to the receivers of the outer darkness and their rulers and their authorities and their powers, they will all sink down and their flame will burn and they will cry out: 'Holy, holy art thou, most holy of all holies.'</p>  
<p>"And if one sayeth that name to the receivers of the wicked chastisements and their authorities and all their powers and also to Barb&#275;l&#333; and the invisible god and the three triple-powered gods, straightway if one will say this name in those regions, they will all fall one on another, will be undone and destroyed and cry out: 'O Light</p>  
<p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></A></p>  
<p>of all lights, which is in the boundless lights, remember us and purify us.'"</p>  
<p>And when Jesus had finished saying these words, all his disciples cried out, wept with loud sobbing, saying: . . .</p>
