### CHAPTER 17

When then he had said this to his disciples, he said unto them: "Who
hath ears to hear, let him hear."

It came to pass then, when Mary had heard the Saviour say these words,
that she gazed fixedly into the air for the space of an hour. She said:
"My Lord, give commandment unto me to speak in openness."

<span class="margnote">Mary Magdalene asketh and receiveth permission to
speak.</span>And Jesus, the compassionate, answered and said unto Mary:
"Mary, thou blessed one, whom I will perfect in all mysteries of those
of the height, discourse in openness, thou, whose heart is raised to the
kingdom of heaven more than all thy brethren."
