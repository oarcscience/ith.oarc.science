# CHAPTER XXVIII

### AGAINST THE TONGUES OF DETRACTORS

"My Son, take it not sadly to heart, if any think ill of thee, and say
of thee what thou art unwilling to hear. Thou oughtest to think worse of
thyself, and to believe no man weaker than thyself. If thou walkest
inwardly, thou wilt not weigh flying words above their value. It is no
small prudence to keep silence in an evil time and to turn inwardly unto
Me, and not to be troubled by human judgment.

2\. "Let not thy peace depend upon the word of men; for whether they
judge well or ill of thee, thou art not therefore any other man than
thyself. Where is true peace or true glory? Is it not in Me? And he who
seeketh not to please men, nor feareth to displease, shall enjoy
abundant peace. From inordinate love and vain fear ariseth all
disquietude of heart, and all distraction of the senses."
