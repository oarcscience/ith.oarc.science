<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.viii.iv-p2"></A>(Gregory put a collection of Basil&#146;s letters with his own, and gave them the first place.&#160; Nicobulus seems to have been surprised at this, and asked the reason.&#160; Gregory explains as follows.)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.viii.iv-p3"></A>I have always preferred the Great Basil to myself, though he was of the contrary opinion; and so I do now, not less for truth&#146;s sake than for friendship&#146;s.&#160; This is the reason why I have given his letters the first place and my own the second.&#160; For I hope we two will always be coupled together; and also I would supply others with an example of modesty and submission.</p>
