<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ii.iv-p2"></A>Although I am at home, my love is expatriated with you, for affection makes us have all things common.&#160; Trusting in the mercy of God, and in your prayers, I have great hopes that all will turn out according to your mind, and that the hurricane will be turned into a gentle breeze, and that God will give you this reward for your orthodoxy, that you will overcome your opponents.&#160; Most of all I long to see you shortly, and to have a good time with you, as I pray.&#160; But if you delay owing to the pressure of affairs, at any rate cheer me by a letter, and do not disdain to tell me all about your circumstances, and to pray for me, as you are accustomed to do.&#160; May God grant you health and good spirits in all circumstances,&#8212;you who are the common prop of the whole Church.</p>
