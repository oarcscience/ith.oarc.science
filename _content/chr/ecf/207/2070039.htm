<p class="c42"><a name="ii.xxvii-p6"></A><i>Wherefore putting away all filthiness, and all guile, and evil speaking</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2471"></A><A HREF="#fn_2471"><FONT SIZE="1">2472</FONT></A>
<i>, &amp;c.</i></p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.xxvii-p8"></A>1.&#160; <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xxvii-p8.1"></A>By</span> the loving-kindness of God ye have heard sufficiently at our former meetings concerning Baptism, and Chrism, and partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ; and now it is necessary to pass on to what is next in order, meaning to-day to set the crown on the spiritual building of your edification.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p9"></A>2.&#160; Ye have seen then the Deacon who gives to the Priest water to wash&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2472"></A><A HREF="#fn_2472"><FONT SIZE="1">2473</FONT></A>
, and to the Presbyters who stand round God&#146;s altar.&#160; He gave it not at all because of bodily defilement; it is not that; for we did not enter the Church at first&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2473"></A><A HREF="#fn_2473"><FONT SIZE="1">2474</FONT></A>
 with defiled bodies.&#160; But the washing of hands is a symbol that ye ought to be pure from all sinful and unlawful deeds; for since the hands are a symbol of action, by washing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2474"></A><A HREF="#fn_2474"><FONT SIZE="1">2475</FONT></A>
 them, it is evident, we represent the purity and blamelessness of our conduct.&#160; Didst thou not hear the blessed David opening this very mystery, and saying, <i>I will wash my hands in innocency, and so will compass Thine Altar, O Lord</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2475"></A><A HREF="#fn_2475"><FONT SIZE="1">2476</FONT></A>
?&#160; The washing therefore of hands is a symbol of immunity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2476"></A><A HREF="#fn_2476"><FONT SIZE="1">2477</FONT></A>
 from sin.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p15"></A>3.&#160; Then the Deacon cries aloud, &#8220;Receive ye one another; and let us kiss one another&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2477"></A><A HREF="#fn_2477"><FONT SIZE="1">2478</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; Think not that this kiss is of the same character with those given in public by common friends.&#160; It is not such:&#160; but this kiss blends souls one with another, and courts entire forgiveness for them.&#160; The kiss therefore is the sign that our souls are mingled together, and banish all remembrance of wrongs.&#160; For this cause Christ said, <i>If thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against time, leave there thy gift upon the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2478"></A><A HREF="#fn_2478"><FONT SIZE="1">2479</FONT></A>
.&#160; The kiss therefore is reconciliation, and for this reason holy:&#160; as the blessed Paul somewhere cried, saying, <i>Greet ye one another with a holy kiss</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2479"></A><A HREF="#fn_2479"><FONT SIZE="1">2480</FONT></A>
; and Peter, <i>with a kiss of charity</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2480"></A><A HREF="#fn_2480"><FONT SIZE="1">2481</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p20"></A>4.&#160; After this the Priest cries aloud, &#8220;Lift up your hearts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2481"></A><A HREF="#fn_2481"><FONT SIZE="1">2482</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; For truly ought we in that most awful hour to have our heart on high with God, and not below, thinking of earth and earthly things.&#160; In effect therefore the Priest bids all in that hour to dismiss all cares of this life, or household anxieties, and to have <A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xxvii-Page_154"></A>their heart in heaven with the merciful God. &#160;Then ye answer, &#8220;We lift them up unto the Lord:&#8221;&#160; assenting to it, by your avowal.&#160; But let no one come here, who could say with his mouth, &#8220;We lift up our hearts unto the Lord,&#8221; but in his thoughts have his mind concerned with the cares of this life.&#160; At all times, rather, God should be in our memory but if this is impossible by reason of human infirmity, in that hour above all this should be our earnest endeavour.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p22"></A>5.&#160; Then the Priest says, &#8220;Let us give thanks unto the Lord.&#8221;&#160; For verily we are bound to give thanks, that He called us, unworthy as we were, to so great grace; that He reconciled us when we were His foes; that He vouchsafed to us the Spirit of adoption.&#160; Then ye say, &#8220;It is meet and right:&#8221;&#160; for in giving thanks we do a meet thing and a right; but He did not right, but more than right, in doing us good, and counting us meet for such great benefits.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p23"></A>6.&#160; After this, we make mention of heaven, and earth, and sea&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2482"></A><A HREF="#fn_2482"><FONT SIZE="1">2483</FONT></A>
; of sun and moon; of stars and all the creation, rational and irrational, visible and invisible; of Angels, Archangels, Virtues, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Thrones; of the Cherubim with many faces:&#160; in effect repeating that call of David&#146;s <i>Magnify the Lord with me</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2483"></A><A HREF="#fn_2483"><FONT SIZE="1">2484</FONT></A>
.&#160; We make mention also of the Seraphim, whom Esaias in the Holy Spirit saw standing around the throne of God, and with two of their wings veiling their face, and with twain their feet, while with twain they did fly, crying <i>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Sabaoth</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2484"></A><A HREF="#fn_2484"><FONT SIZE="1">2485</FONT></A>
.&#160; For the reason of our reciting this confession of God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2485"></A><A HREF="#fn_2485"><FONT SIZE="1">2486</FONT></A>
, delivered down to us from the Seraphim, is this, that so we may be partakers with the hosts of the world above in their Hymn of praise.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p28"></A>7.&#160; Then having sanctified ourselves by these spiritual Hymns, we beseech the merciful God to send forth His Holy Spirit upon the gifts lying before Him; that He may make the Bread the Body of Christ, and the Wine the Blood of Christ&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2486"></A><A HREF="#fn_2486"><FONT SIZE="1">2487</FONT></A>
; for whatsoever the Holy Ghost has touched, is surely sanctified and changed.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p30"></A>8.&#160; Then, after the spiritual sacrifice, the bloodless service, is completed, over that sacrifice of propitiation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2487"></A><A HREF="#fn_2487"><FONT SIZE="1">2488</FONT></A>
 we entreat God for the common peace of the Churches, for the welfare of the world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2488"></A><A HREF="#fn_2488"><FONT SIZE="1">2489</FONT></A>
; for kings; for soldiers and allies; for the sick; for the afflicted; and, in a word, for all who stand in need of succour we all pray and offer this sacrifice.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p33"></A>9.&#160; Then we commemorate also those who have fallen asleep before us, first Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, that at their prayers and intercessions God would receive our petition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2489"></A><A HREF="#fn_2489"><FONT SIZE="1">2490</FONT></A>
.&#160; Then on behalf also of the Holy Fathers and Bishops who have fallen asleep before us, and in a word of all who in past years have fallen asleep among us, believing that it will be a very great benefit to the souls&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2490"></A><A HREF="#fn_2490"><FONT SIZE="1">2491</FONT></A>
, for whom the supplication is put up, while that holy and most awful sacrifice is set forth.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p36"></A>10.&#160; And I wish to persuade you by an illustration.&#160; For I know that many say, what is a soul profited, which departs from this world either with sins, or without sins, if it be commemorated in the prayer?&#160; For if a king were to banish certain who had given him offence, and then those who belong to them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2491"></A><A HREF="#fn_2491"><FONT SIZE="1">2492</FONT></A>
 <A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xxvii-Page_155"></A>should weave a crown and offer it to him on behalf of those under punishment, would he not grant a remission of their penalties?&#160; In the same way we, when we offer to Him our supplications for those who have fallen asleep, though they be sinners, weave no crown, but offer up Christ sacrificed for our sins&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2492"></A><A HREF="#fn_2492"><FONT SIZE="1">2493</FONT></A>
, propitiating our merciful God for them as well as for ourselves.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p39"></A>11.&#160; Then, after these things, we say that Prayer which the Saviour delivered to His own disciples, with a pure conscience entitling God our Father, and saying, <i>Our Father, which art in heaven</i>.&#160; O most surpassing loving-kindness of God!&#160; On them who revolted from Him and were in the very extreme of misery has He bestowed such a complete forgiveness of evil deeds, and so great participation of grace, as that they should even call Him Father.&#160; <i>Our Father, which art in heaven</i>; and they also are a heaven who <i>bear the image of the heavenly</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2493"></A><A HREF="#fn_2493"><FONT SIZE="1">2494</FONT></A>
, in whom is God, <i>dwelling and walking in them</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2494"></A><A HREF="#fn_2494"><FONT SIZE="1">2495</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p42"></A>12.&#160; <i>Hallowed be Thy Name</i>.&#160; The Name of God is in its nature holy, whether we say so or not; but since it is sometimes profaned among sinners, according to the words, <i>Through you My Name is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2495"></A><A HREF="#fn_2495"><FONT SIZE="1">2496</FONT></A>
, we pray that in us God&#146;s Name may be hallowed; not that it comes to be holy from not being holy, but because it becomes holy in us, when we are made holy, and do things worthy of holiness.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p44"></A>13.&#160; <i>Thy kingdom come</i>.&#160; A pure soul can say with boldness, <i>Thy kingdom come</i>; for he who has heard Paul saying, <i>Let not therefore sin reign in your mortal body</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2496"></A><A HREF="#fn_2496"><FONT SIZE="1">2497</FONT></A>
, and has cleansed himself in deed, and thought, and word, will say to God, <i>Thy kingdom come</i>.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p46"></A>14.&#160; <i>Thy will be done as in heaven so on earth</i>.&#160; God&#146;s divine and blessed Angels do the will of God, as David said in the Psalm, <i>Bless the Lord, all ye Angels of His, mighty in strength, that do His pleasure</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2497"></A><A HREF="#fn_2497"><FONT SIZE="1">2498</FONT></A>
.&#160; So then in effect thou meanest this by thy prayer, &#8220;as in the Angels Thy will is done, so likewise be it done on earth in me, O Lord.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p48"></A>15.&#160; <i>Give us this day our substantial bread</i>.&#160; This common bread is not substantial bread, but this Holy Bread is substantial, that is, appointed for the substance of the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2498"></A><A HREF="#fn_2498"><FONT SIZE="1">2499</FONT></A>
.&#160; For this Bread <i>goeth</i> not <i>into the belly and is cast out into the draught</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2499"></A><A HREF="#fn_2499"><FONT SIZE="1">2500</FONT></A>
, but is distributed into thy whole system for the benefit of body and soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2500"></A><A HREF="#fn_2500"><FONT SIZE="1">2501</FONT></A>
.&#160; But by <i>this day</i>, he means, &#8220;each day,&#8221; as also Paul said, <i>While it is called to-day</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2501"></A><A HREF="#fn_2501"><FONT SIZE="1">2502</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p53"></A>16.&#160; <i>And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors</i>.&#160; For we have many sins.&#160; For we offend both in word and in thought, and very many things we do worthy of condemnation; and <i>if we say that we have no sin</i>, we lie, as John says&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2502"></A><A HREF="#fn_2502"><FONT SIZE="1">2503</FONT></A>
.&#160; And we make a covenant with God, entreating Him to forgive us our sins, as we also forgive our neighbours their debts.&#160; Considering then what we receive and in return for what, let us not put off nor delay to forgive one another.&#160; The offences committed against us are slight and trivial, and easily settled; but those which we have committed against God are great, and need such mercy as His only is.&#160; Take heed therefore, lest for the slight and trivial sins against thee thou shut out for thyself forgiveness from God for thy very grievous sins.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p55"></A>17.&#160; <i>And lead us not into temptation, O Lord</i>.&#160; Is this then what the Lord teaches us to pray, that we may not be tempted at all?&#160; How then is it said elsewhere, &#8220;a man untempted, is a man unproved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2503"></A><A HREF="#fn_2503"><FONT SIZE="1">2504</FONT></A>
;&#8221; and again, <i>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2504"></A><A HREF="#fn_2504"><FONT SIZE="1">2505</FONT></A>
?&#160; But does perchance the entering into temptation mean the being overwhelmed by the temptation?&#160; For temptation is, as it were, like a winter torrent difficult to cross.&#160; Those therefore who are not overwhelmed in temptations, pass through, shewing themselves excellent swimmers, and not being swept away by them at all; while those who are not such, enter into them and are overwhelmed.&#160; As for example, Judas having entered into the temptation of the love of money, swam not through it, but was overwhelmed and was strangled&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2505"></A><A HREF="#fn_2505"><FONT SIZE="1">2506</FONT></A>
 both in body and spirit.&#160; Peter entered into the temptation of the denial; but having entered, he was not over<A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xxvii-Page_156"></A>whelmed by it, but manfully swam through it, and was delivered from the temptation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2506"></A><A HREF="#fn_2506"><FONT SIZE="1">2507</FONT></A>
.&#160; Listen again, in another place, to a company of unscathed saints, giving thanks for deliverance from temptation, <i>Thou, O God hast proved us; Thou hast tried us by fire like as silver is tried.&#160; Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst afflictions upon our loins.&#160; Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water; and thou broughtest us out into a place of rest</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2507"></A><A HREF="#fn_2507"><FONT SIZE="1">2508</FONT></A>
.&#160; Thou seest them speaking boldly in regard to their having passed through and not been pierced&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2508"></A><A HREF="#fn_2508"><FONT SIZE="1">2509</FONT></A>
.&#160; <i>But Thou broughtest us out into a place of rest</i>; now their coming into a place of rest is their being delivered from temptation.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p62"></A>18.&#160; <i>But deliver us from the evil</i>.&#160; If <i>Lead us not into temptation</i> implied the not being tempted at all, He would not have said, <i>But deliver us from the evil</i>.&#160; Now evil is our adversary the devil, from whom we pray to be delivered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2509"></A><A HREF="#fn_2509"><FONT SIZE="1">2510</FONT></A>
.&#160; Then after completing the prayer thou sayest, <i>Amen</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2510"></A><A HREF="#fn_2510"><FONT SIZE="1">2511</FONT></A>
; by this <i>Amen</i>, which means &#8220;So be it,&#8221; setting thy seal to the petitions of the divinely-taught prayer.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p65"></A>19.&#160; After this the Priest says, &#8220;Holy things to holy men.&#8221;&#160; Holy are the gifts presented, having received the visitation of the Holy Ghost; holy are ye also, having been deemed worthy of the Holy Ghost; the holy things therefore correspond to the holy persons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2511"></A><A HREF="#fn_2511"><FONT SIZE="1">2512</FONT></A>
.&#160; Then ye say, &#8220;One is Holy, One is the Lord, Jesus Christ&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2512"></A><A HREF="#fn_2512"><FONT SIZE="1">2513</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; For One is truly holy, by nature holy; we too are holy, but not by nature, only by participation, and discipline, and prayer.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p68"></A>20.&#160; After this ye hear the chanter inviting you with a sacred melody to the communion of the Holy Mysteries, and saying, <i>O taste and see that the Lord is good</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2513"></A><A HREF="#fn_2513"><FONT SIZE="1">2514</FONT></A>
.&#160; Trust not the judgment to thy bodily palate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2514"></A><A HREF="#fn_2514"><FONT SIZE="1">2515</FONT></A>
 no, but to faith unfaltering; for they who taste are bidden to taste, not bread and wine, but the anti-typical&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2515"></A><A HREF="#fn_2515"><FONT SIZE="1">2516</FONT></A>
 Body and Blood of Christ.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p72"></A>21.&#160; In approaching&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2516"></A><A HREF="#fn_2516"><FONT SIZE="1">2517</FONT></A>
 therefore, come not with thy wrists extended, or thy fingers spread; but make thy left hand a throne for the right, as for that which is to receive a King&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2517"></A><A HREF="#fn_2517"><FONT SIZE="1">2518</FONT></A>
.&#160; And having hollowed thy palm, receive the Body of Christ, saying over it, <i>Amen</i>.&#160; So then after having carefully hallowed thine eyes by the touch of the Holy Body, partake of it; giving heed lest thou lose any portion thereof&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2518"></A><A HREF="#fn_2518"><FONT SIZE="1">2519</FONT></A>
; for whatever thou losest, is evidently a loss to thee as it were from one of thine own members.&#160; For tell me, if any one gave thee grains of gold, wouldest thou not hold them with all carefulness, being on thy guard against losing any of them, and suffering loss?&#160; Wilt thou not then much more carefully keep watch, that not a crumb fall from thee of what is more precious than gold and precious stones?</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p76"></A>22.&#160; Then after thou hast partaken of the Body of Christ, draw near also to the Cup of His Blood; not stretching forth thine hands, but bending&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2519"></A><A HREF="#fn_2519"><FONT SIZE="1">2520</FONT></A>
, and saying with an air of worship and reverence, <i>Amen</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2520"></A><A HREF="#fn_2520"><FONT SIZE="1">2521</FONT></A>
, hallow thyself by partaking also of the Blood of Christ.&#160; And while the moisture is still upon thy lips, touch it with thine hands, and hallow thine eyes and brow and the other organs of sense&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2521"></A><A HREF="#fn_2521"><FONT SIZE="1">2522</FONT></A>
.&#160; Then wait for the prayer, and give thanks unto God, who hath accounted thee worthy of so great mysteries&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2522"></A><A HREF="#fn_2522"><FONT SIZE="1">2523</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xxvii-p81"></A><A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xxvii-Page_157"></A>23.&#160; Hold fast these traditions undefiled and, keep yourselves free from offence.&#160; Sever not yourselves from the Communion; deprive not yourselves, through the pollution of sins, of these Holy and Spiritual Mysteries.&#160; <i>And the God of peace sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit, and soul, and body be preserved entire without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2523"></A><A HREF="#fn_2523"><FONT SIZE="1">2524</FONT></A>
:&#8212;To whom be glory and honour and might, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and world without end.&#160; Amen.</p>
