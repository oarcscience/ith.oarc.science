<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.iii.v-p2"></A>(The following letter is sometimes attributed to Basil, and is found in his works as well as in those of Gregory.&#160; The <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.iii.v-p2.1"></A>mss.</span> however, with only a single exception, give it to the latter.)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.iii.v-p3"></A>You give me pleasure both by writing and remembering me, and a much greater pleasure by sending me your blessing in your letter.&#160; But if I were worthy of your sufferings and of your conflicts for Christ and through Christ I should have been counted worthy also to come to you, to embrace Your Piety, and to take example by your patience in your sufferings.&#160; But since I am not worthy of this, being troubled with many afflictions and hindrances I do what is next best.&#160; I address Your Perfection, and I beg you not to be weary of remembering me.&#160; For to be deemed worthy of your letters is not only profitable to me, but is also a matter to boast of to many people, and is an honour, because I am considered by a man of so great virtue, and such near relations with God, that he can bring others also by word and example into relation to Him.</p>
