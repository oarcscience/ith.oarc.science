<p class="c42"><a name="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p1.1"></A>To Olympius.&#160; Ep. CXLVI.</span></p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p2"></A>This is what I said as if by a sort of prophecy, when I found you favourable to every request, and was making insatiable use of your gentleness, that I fear I shall exhaust your kindness upon the affairs of others.&#160; For see, a contest of my own has come (if that is mine which concerns my own relations), and I cannot speak with the same freedom.&#160; First, because it is my own.&#160; For to entreat for myself, though it may be more useful, is more humiliating.&#160; And next, I am afraid of excess as destroying pleasure, and opposing all that is good.&#160; So matters stand, and I conjecture only too rightly.&#160; Nevertheless with confidence in God before Whom I stand, and in your magnanimity in doing good, I am bold to present this petition.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iv.ix.xiii-p3"></A>Suppose Nicobulus to be the worst of men:&#8212;though his only crime is that through me he is an object of envy, and more free than he ought to be.&#160; And suppose that my present opponent is the most just of men.&#160; For I am ashamed to accuse before Your Uprightness one whom yesterday I was supporting:&#160; but I do not know if it will seem to you just that punishment should be demanded for one man&#146;s crimes from another, though these were quite strange to him, and had not even his consent; from the man who has so stirred his household and been so upset as to have surrendered to his accuser more readily than the latter wished.&#160; Must Nicobulus or his children be reduced to slavery as his persecutors desire?&#160; I am ashamed both of the ground of the persecution and of the time, if this is to be done while both you are in power and I have influence with you.&#160; Not so, most admirable friend, let not this be suggested to Your Integrity.&#160; But recognizing by the winged swiftness of your mind the malice from which this proceeds, and having respect to me your admirer, shew yourself a merciful judge to those who are being disturbed&#8212;for to-day you are not merely judging between man and man, but between virtue and vice; and to this more consideration than by an ordinary man must be given by those who are like you in virtue and are skilful governors.&#160; And in return for this you shall have from me not only the matter of my prayers, which I know you do not, like so many men, despise; but also that I will make your government famous with all to whom I am known.</p>
