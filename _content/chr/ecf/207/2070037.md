<span id="ii.xxv-p5"></span>But ye have an unction from the Holy One,
&c..…that, when He shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be
ashamed before Him at His coming.

<span id="ii.xxv-p6"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxv-p6.1"></span>Having</span> been *baptized into Christ*, and
*put on Christ <span id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414)* , ye have
been made conformable to the Son of God; for God having *foreordained us
unto adoption as sons <span id="fr_2415"></span>[2416](#fn_2415)* , made
us *to be conformed to the body of Christ’s glory* <span
id="fr_2416"></span>[2417](#fn_2416) .  Having therefore become
*partakers of Christ* <span id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417) , ye
are properly called Christs, and of you God said, *Touch not My
Christs* <span id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418) , or anointed.  Now
ye have been made Christs, by receiving the antitype <span
id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419) of the Holy Ghost; and all things
have been wrought in you by imitation <span
id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420) , because ye are images of Christ. 
He washed in the river Jordan, and having imparted of the
fragrance <span id="fr_2421"></span>[2422](#fn_2421) of His Godhead to
the waters, He came up from them; and the Holy Ghost in the fulness of
His being <span id="fr_2422"></span>[2423](#fn_2422) lighted on Him,
like resting upon like <span id="fr_2423"></span>[2424](#fn_2423) .  And
to you in like manner, after you had come up from the pool of the sacred
streams, there was given an Unction <span
id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424) , the anti-type of that wherewith
Christ was anointed; and this is the Holy Ghost; of whom also the
blessed Esaias, in his prophecy respecting Him, said in the person of
the Lord, *The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed
Me:  He hath sent Me to preach glad tidings to the poor* <span
id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425) .

<span id="ii.xxv-p22"></span>2.  For Christ was not anointed by men with
oil or material ointment, but the Father having before appointed Him to
be the Saviour of the whole world, anointed Him with the Holy Ghost, as
Peter says, *Jesus of Nazareth, whom God anointed with the Holy
Ghost* <span id="fr_2426"></span>[2427](#fn_2426) .  David also the
Prophet cried, saying, *Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a
sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom; Thou hast loved
righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God even Thy God hath
anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows* <span
id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427) .  And as Christ was in reality
crucified, and buried, and raised, and you are in Baptism accounted
worthy of being crucified, buried, and raised together with Him in a
likeness, so is it with the unction also.  As He was anointed with an
ideal <span id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428) oil of gladness, that
is, with the Holy Ghost, called oil of gladness, because He is the
author of spiritual gladness, so ye were anointed with ointment, having
been made partakers and *fellows of Christ*.

<span id="ii.xxv-p26"></span><span id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span
id="ii.xxv-Page_150"></span>3.  But beware of supposing this to be plain
ointment.  For as the Bread of the Eucharist, after the invocation of
the Holy Ghost, is mere bread no longer <span
id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429) , but the Body of Christ, so also
this holy ointment is no more simple ointment, nor (so to say) common,
after invocation, but it is Christ’s gift of grace, and, by the advent
of the Holy Ghost, is made fit to impart His Divine Nature <span
id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430) .  Which ointment is symbolically
applied to thy forehead and thy other senses <span
id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431) ; and while thy body is anointed
with the visible ointment, thy soul is sanctified by the Holy and
life-giving Spirit.

<span id="ii.xxv-p32"></span>4.  And ye were first anointed on the
forehead, that ye might be delivered from the shame, which the first man
who transgressed bore about with him everywhere; and that *with unveiled
face ye might reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord* <span
id="fr_2432"></span>[2433](#fn_2432) .  Then on your ears; that ye might
receive the ears which are quick to hear the Divine Mysteries, of which
Esaias said, *The Lord gave me also an ear to hear* <span
id="fr_2433"></span>[2434](#fn_2433) ; and the Lord Jesus in the Gospel,
*He that hath ears to hear let him hear* <span
id="fr_2434"></span>[2435](#fn_2434) .  Then on the nostrils; that
receiving the sacred ointment ye may say, *We are to God a sweet savour
of Christ, in them that are saved* <span
id="fr_2435"></span>[2436](#fn_2435) .  Afterwards on your breast; that
having put on the *breast-plate of righteousness*, ye may *stand against
the wiles of the devil* <span id="fr_2436"></span>[2437](#fn_2436) . 
For as Christ after His Baptism, and the visitation of the Holy Ghost,
went forth and vanquished the adversary, so likewise ye, after Holy
Baptism and the Mystical Chrism, having put on the whole armour of the
Holy Ghost, are to stand against the power of the adversary, and
vanquish it, saying, *I can do all things through Christ which
strengtheneth me* <span id="fr_2437"></span>[2438](#fn_2437) .

<span id="ii.xxv-p39"></span>5.  Having been counted worthy of this Holy
Chrism, ye are called Christians, verifying the name also by your new
birth.  For before you were deemed worthy of this grace, ye had properly
no right to this title, but were advancing on your way towards being
Christians.

<span id="ii.xxv-p40"></span>6.  Moreover, you should know that in the
old Scripture there lies the symbol of this Chrism.  For what time Moses
imparted to his brother the command of God, and made him High-priest,
after bathing in water, he anointed him; and Aaron was called Christ or
Anointed, evidently from the typical Chrism.  So also the High-priest,
in advancing Solomon to the kingdom, anointed him after he had bathed in
Gihon <span id="fr_2438"></span>[2439](#fn_2438) .  To them however
these things happened in a figure, but to you not in a figure, but in
truth; because ye were truly anointed by the Holy Ghost.  Christ is the
beginning of your salvation; for He is truly the First-fruit, and ye the
mass <span id="fr_2439"></span>[2440](#fn_2439) ; but if the First-fruit
be holy, it is manifest that Its holiness will pass to the mass also.

<span id="ii.xxv-p43"></span>7.  Keep This unspotted:  for it shall
teach you all things, if it abide in you, as you have just heard
declared by the blessed John, discoursing much concerning this
Unction <span id="fr_2440"></span>[2441](#fn_2440) .  For this holy
thing is a spiritual safeguard of the body, and salvation of the soul. 
Of this the blessed Esaias prophesying of old time said, *And on this
mountain*,—(now he calls the Church a mountain elsewhere also, as when
he says, *In the last days the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be
manifest* <span id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441) ;)—*on this
mountain shall the Lord make unto all nations a feast; they shall drink
wine, they shall drink gladness, they shall anoint themselves with
ointment* <span id="fr_2442"></span>[2443](#fn_2442) .  And that he may
make thee sure, hear what he says of this ointment as being mystical;
*Deliver all these things to the nations, for the counsel of the Lord is
unto all nations* <span id="fr_2443"></span>[2444](#fn_2443) .  Having
been anointed, therefore, with this holy ointment, keep it unspotted and
unblemished in you, pressing forward by good works, and being made
well-pleasing to the Captain of your salvation, Christ Jesus, to whom be
glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="ii.xxv-p14"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

Ed. writes:  “For <span class="Greek"><span

class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p14.6"></span>χρῶτων</span> from <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p14.7"></span>χρῶτες</span>.  Authors use
the word <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p14.8"></span>χρῶτα</span>
to signify the effluence of an odour.  So Gregory of Nyssa takes it in
his 3rd *Homily on the Song of Songs*, p. 512; and S. Maximus in
*Question* 37 *on Scripture*:  ‘<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxv-p14.9"></span>χρῶτα</span> we say is the godliness (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p14.10"></span>εὐσέβειαν</span>) whereby
S. Paul was *to the one a savour of life unto life.*’…In the
*Procatechesis*, § 15, Cyril calls the waters of Baptism <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p14.11"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p14.12"></span>δάτων χριστοφόρων ἐχόντων
εὐωδίαν</span>.  If however any one prefers the reading <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p14.13"></span>φώτων</span>, he may
defend himself by the authority of Epiphanius, who in the *Exposition of
the Faith*, c. 15, says that Christ descending into the water gave
rather than received,.…illuminating them, and empowering them for a type
of what was to be accomplished in Him.”  According to the Ebionite
Gospel of St. Matthew in Epiphanius (*Hær*. xxx. *Ebionitæ*. c. 13),
when Jesus came up out of the water a great light shone around the
place:  a tradition to which the Benedictine Editor thinks the reading
<span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p14.14"></span>φώτων</span> may
refer.  Justin M. (*Dialog*. c. lxxxviii.):  “When Jesus had stepped
into the water, a fire was kindled in the Jordan.”  Otto quotes the
legend, as found in *Orac. Sibyll*. vii. 81–83:—

<span id="ii.xxv-p15"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxv-p15.1"></span>῞</span><span class="Greek"><span

<span id="ii.xxv-p18"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxv-p18.1"></span>οὐσιώδης ἐπιφοίησις ἐγένετο</span>.  The
Benedictine Editor understands this phrase as an allusion to the descent
of the Holy Ghost on Jesus in a substantial bodily form.  So Gregory
Nazianzen (*Orat* xliv. 17), says that the Holy Ghost descended on the
Apostles <span class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p18.2"></span>οὐσιωδῶς καὶ
σωματικῶς</span>.  But Anastasius Sinaita interprets <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p18.3"></span>οὐσιωδῶς</span> in this
latter passage as meaning “in the essence and reality of His (Divine )
Person:”  and this latter sense agreeing with the frequent use of <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p18.4"></span>οὐσιωδής</span> by
Athanasius is well rendered by Canon Mason (*The Relation of
Confirmation to Baptism*, p. 343, “in the fulness of His being.”

<span id="fn_2423"></span>[149:2424](2070037.htm#fr_2423) <span
id="ii.xxv-p18.5"></span>

<span id="ii.xxv-p19"></span> Cf. Greg. Naz. *Orat*. xxxix:  “The Sprit
also bears witness to His Godhead, for he comes to that which is like
Himself.”

<span id="fn_2424"></span>[149:2425](2070037.htm#fr_2424) <span
id="ii.xxv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxv-p20"></span> Cf. Tertullian, *De Baptismo*, c. 7: 
“Exinde egressi de lavacro perungimur benedictâ unctione.”  It is clear
that the Unction mentioned in these passages was conferred at the same
time and place as Baptism.  Whether it formed part of that Sacrament, or
was regarded by Cyril as a separate and independent rite, has been made
a matter of controversy.  See Index, “Chrism.”

<span id="ii.xxv-p28"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxv-p28.1"></span>Χριστοῦ χάρισμα καὶ Πνεύματος ἁγίου παρουσίᾳ
τῆς αὐτοῦ Θεότητος ἐνεργητικὸν γινόμενον</span>.  The meaning of this
passage seems to have been obscured by divergent views of the order and
construction of the words.  In the Oxford translation, followed by Dr.
Pusey (*Real Presence*, p. 357), the Chrism is “the gift of Christ, and
by the presence of His godhead it causes in us the Holy Ghost.”  The
order of the operations proper to the two Divine Persons seems thus to
be inverted.

<span id="ii.xxv-p29"></span>According to the Benedictine Editor, and
Canon Mason (*Relation of Confirmation to Baptism*, p. 344), it is
“Christ’s gracious gift, and is made effectual to convey the Holy Ghost
by the presence of His own Godhead,”—i.e. apparently, the Godhead of the
Holy Ghost conveys the Holy Ghost.

<span id="ii.xxv-p30"></span>But according to the context “the presence”
must be that of the Divine Person who has been invoked, namely the Holy
Ghost:  and this is clearly expressed in the order of the words <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p30.1"></span>Πνεύματος ἁγίου παρουσίᾳ
τῆς αὐτοῦ θεότητος ἐνεργητικόν</span>.  The connexion of the words <span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxv-p30.2"></span>Πν. ἁγ. παρουσίᾳ</span> is
put beyond doubt by the Invocation in the Liturgy of S. James quoted in
*Myst*. V. 7, note 8.  The true meaning thus seems to be that the Chrism
is Christ’s gift of grace, and imparts His Divine nature by the presence
of the Holy Ghost after the Invocation.  This meaning is confirmed by
the formula given in *Apost. Const*. vii. 44, for the consecration of
the Chrism:  “Grant also now that this ointment may be made effectual in
the baptized, that the sweet savour of Thy Christ may remain firm and
stable in him, and that, having died with Him, he may rise again and
live with Him.”  The Chrism is thus regarded as “the Seal” which
confirms the proper benefits of Baptism.
