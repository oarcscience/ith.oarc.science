<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Ep. XXVI.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p2"></span>What a very small quantity of vegetables
you have sent me!  They must surely be golden vegetables!  And yet your
whole wealth consists of orchards and rivers and groves and gardens, and
your country is productive of vegetables as other lands are of gold, and

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p3"></span>You dwell among meadowy leafage.

<span id="iv.iv.v.iv-p4"></span>But corn is for you a fabulous
happiness, and your bread is the bread of angels, as the saying is, so
welcome is it, and so little can you reckon upon it.  Either, then, send
me your vegetables less grudgingly, or—I won’t threaten you with
anything else, but I won’t send you any corn, and will see whether there
is any truth in the saying that grasshoppers live on dew!
