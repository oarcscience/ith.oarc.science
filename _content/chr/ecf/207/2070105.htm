<p class="c42"><a name="iv.iv.i.i-p4"></A><span class="c1"><a name="iv.iv.i.i-p4.1"></A>Ep. VII.</span></p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.i.i-p5"></A>(On the death of the Emperor Constantius the undisputed succession devolved on his cousin Julian the Apostate, who at once began to employ all the power of the Empire to discourage, while not absolutely persecuting, Christianity, and to restore the supremacy of the ancient Paganism.&#160; One of his first acts was to dismiss all the men who had held high dignities under his predecessor.&#160; S. C&aelig;sarius, Gregory&#146;s brother, was however to be excepted; Julian, who had perhaps known and esteemed him at Athens, did all that he could to keep him at Court, and to attach him to himself.&#160; This caused much anxiety to Gregory and other friends of C&aelig;sarius, who foresaw that Julian would do his utmost to shake the young man&#146;s faith, and could not feel sure that he would have courage to resist such assaults.&#160; In his trouble Gregory wrote him the following letter.&#160; Shortly afterwards the expected attempt was made.&#160; S. C&aelig;sarius bravely held his ground against the Emperor, and after declaring his unalterable determination to hold firm to his faith, resigned his office at Court and withdrew to Nazianzus.)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.i.i-p6"></A>I have had enough to blush for in you; that I was grieved, it is hardly necessary to say to him who of all men knows me best.&#160; But, not to speak of my own feelings, or of the distress with which the rumour about you filled me (and let me say also the fear), I should have liked you, had it been possible, to have heard what was said by others, both relations and outsiders, who are any way acquainted with us (Christians I mean, of course,) about you and me; and not only some of them, but everyone in turn alike; for men are always more ready to philosophize about strangers than about their own relations.&#160; Such speeches as the following have become a sort of exercise among them:&#160; Now a Bishop&#146;s son takes service in the army; now he covets exterior power and fame; now he is a slave of money, when the fire is being rekindled for all, and men are running the race for life; and he does not deem the one only glory and safety and wealth to be to stand nobly against the times, and to place himself as far as possible out of reach of every abomination and defilement.&#160; How then can the Bishop exhort others not to be carried along with the times, or to be mixed up with idols?&#160; How can he rebuke those who do wrong in other ways, seeing his own home takes away his right to speak freely?&#160; We have every day to hear this, and even more severe things, some of the speakers perhaps saying them from a motive of friendship, and others with unfriendly feelings.&#160; How do you think we feel, and what is the state of mind with which we, men professing to serve God, and to deem the only good to be to look forward to the hopes of the future, hear such things as these?&#160; Our venerable Father is very much distressed by all that he hears, which even disgusts him with life.&#160; I console and comfort him as best I can, by making myself surety for your mind, and assuring him that you will not continue thus to grieve us.&#160; But if our dear Mother were to hear about you (so far we have kept her in the dark by various devices), I think she would be altogether inconsolable; being, as a woman, of a weak mind, and besides unable, through her great piety, to control her feelings on such matters.&#160; If then you care at all for yourself and us, try some better and safer course.&#160; Our means are certainly enough for an independent life, at least for a man of moderate desires, who is not insatiable in his lust for more.&#160; Moreover, I do not see what occasion for your settling down we are to wait for, if we let this one pass.&#160; But if you cling to the same opinion, and every <A NAME="page_458"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 458</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.i.i-Page_458"></A>thing seems to you of small account in comparison with your own desires, I do not wish to say anything else that may vex you, but this I foretell and protest, that one of two things must happen; either you, remaining a genuine Christian, will be ranked among the lowest, and will be in a position unworthy of yourself and your hopes; or in grasping at honours you will injure yourself in what is more important, and will have a share in the smoke, if not actually in the fire.</p>
