id="iv.iv.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>Ep. CVI.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.ix.iii-p2"></span>Here is another laying before you a
letter, of which, if the truth may be said, you are the cause yourself,
for you provoke them by the honour you do them.  Here too is another
petitioner for you, a prisoner of fear, our kinsman Eustratius, who with
us and by us entreats your goodness, inasmuch as he cannot endure to be
in perpetual rebellion against your government, even though a just
terror has frightened him, nor does he choose to entreat you by anyone
else than me, that he may make your mercy to him more conspicuous
through his use of such intercessors, whom at all events you yourself
make great by thus accepting their appeal.  I will say one thing, and
that briefly.  All the other favours you conferred upon me; but this you
will confer upon your own judgment, since once you purposed to comfort
our age and infirmity with such honours.  And I will add that you are
continually rendering God more propitious to you.
