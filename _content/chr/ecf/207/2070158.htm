<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.viii-p2"></A>(S. Gregory had to carry out his threat.&#160; He resigned the care of Nazianzus, and nothing would induce him to withdraw his resignation.&#160; Bosporius wrote him an urgent letter with this object, but he replied as follows:)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.vii.viii-p3"></A>Twice I have been tripped up by you, and have been deceived (you know what I mean), and, if it was justly, may the Lord smell from you an odour of sweet savour;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4771"></A><A HREF="#fn_4771"><FONT SIZE="1">4772</FONT></A>
 if unjustly, may the Lord pardon it.&#160; For so it is reasonable for me to speak of you, seeing we are commanded to be patient when injuries are inflicted on us.&#160; But as you are master of your own opinions, so am I of mine.&#160; That troublesome Gregory will no longer be troublesome to you.&#160; I will withdraw myself to God, Who alone is pure and guileless.&#160; I will retire into myself.&#160; This I have determined; for to stumble twice on the same stone is attributed by the proverb to fools alone.</p>
