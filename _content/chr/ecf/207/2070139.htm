Basil regarded him with affectionate esteem.&#160; Indeed S. Basil&#146;s Rule for Monks is based on one drawn up by him.&#160; But after Basil&#146;s elevation to the Episcopate Eustathius began to oppose him and to calumniate him on all sides, and even entered openly into communion with the Arians.&#160; It would seem that this man tried to get Amphilochius round to his side, and through him Gregory.)</p>
