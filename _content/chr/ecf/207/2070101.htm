<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iii.xxii-p3"></A>This was a case which any wiser man would have foreseen; but I who am very simple and foolish did not fear it in writing to you.&#160; My letter grieved you; but in my opinion neither rightly nor justly, but quite unreasonably.&#160; And whilst you did not acknowledge that you were hurt, neither did you conceal it, or if you did it was with great skill, as with a mask, hiding your vexation under an appearance of respect.&#160; But as to myself if I acted in this deceitfully or maliciously, I shall be punished not more by your vexation than by the truth itself; but if in simplicity and with my accustomed goodwill, I will lay the blame on my own sins rather than on your temper.&#160; But it would have been better to have set this matter straight, rather than to be angry with those who offer you counsel.&#160; But you must see to your own affairs, inasmuch as you are quite capable of giving the same advice to others.&#160; You may look upon me as very ready, if God will, both to come to you, and to join you in the conflict, and to contribute all that I can.&#160; For who would flinch, who would not rather take courage in speaking and contending for the truth under you and by your side?</p>
