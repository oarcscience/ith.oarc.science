id="iv.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Ep. XVIII.  To Eusebius of Cæsarea.</span>

<span id="iv.iii.x-p2"></span>I was never meanly disposed towards your
Reverence; do not find me guilty.  But after allowing myself a little
liberty and boldness, just to relieve and heal my grief, I at once bowed
and submitted, and willingly subjected myself to the Canon.  What else
could I have done, knowing both you and the Law of the Spirit?  But if I
had been ever so mean and ignoble in my sentiments, yet the present time
would not allow such feelings, nor the wild beasts which are rushing on
the Church, nor your own courage and manliness, so purely and genuinely
fighting for the Church.  I will come then, if you wish it, and take
part with you in prayers and in conflict, and will serve you, and like
cheering boys will stir up the noble athlete by my exhortations.
