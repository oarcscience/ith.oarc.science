<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ii.ii-p2"></A>(When S. Gregory was consecrated Bishop of Nyssa the Imperial Throne was occupied by Valens, an ardent Arian, whose mind was bent on the destruction of the Nicene Faith.&#160; He appointed, with this object, one Demosthenes, a former clerk of the Imperial Kitchen, to be Vicar of the civil Diocese of Pontus.&#160; An old quarrel with Basil had made this man unfriendly to Gregory, and after persecuting him in various small ways for some time he procured, <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ii.ii-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 275, the summoning of a Synod to enquire into some allegations of irregularity in his consecration, and to try Gregory on some frivolous charges of malversation of Church funds.&#160; Gregory was unable to attend this Synod, which met at Ancyra, on account of an attack of pleurisy; and another was summoned to meet at Nyssa itself.&#160; Gregory however refused to appear, and was deposed as contumacious.&#160; Thereupon Valens banished him, and he seems to have fallen into very low spirits, almost into despondency at the apparent triumph of the heretical party.&#160; The three letters which follow throw some light upon his state at this time.&#160; They were written in answer to letters of his now lost, and their object was to comfort him in his trouble and to encourage him to take heart again in the hope of a good day coming.&#160; This more cheerful tone was justified by the event, for on the death of Valens, <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ii.ii-p2.2"></A>a.d.</span> 378, the exiled Bishops were restored by Gratian, and Gregory was replaced in his Episcopal Throne, to the great joy of the faithful of his Diocese.)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ii.ii-p3"></A>Do not let your troubles distress you too much.&#160; For the less we grieve over things, the less grievous they are.&#160; It is nothing strange that the heretics have thawed, and are taking courage from the springtime, and creeping out of their holes, as you write.&#160; They will hiss for a short time, I know, and then will hide themselves again, overcome both by the truth and the times, and all the more so the more we commit the whole matter to God.</p>
