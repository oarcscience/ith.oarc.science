<p class="c42"><a name="ii.xiv-p3"></A><i>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1113"></A><A HREF="#fn_1113"><FONT SIZE="1">1114</FONT></A>
<i>; yet to us there is One God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and One Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him.</i></p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.xiv-p5"></A>1.&#160; <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p5.1"></A>They</span> who have been taught to believe &#8220;<span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p5.2"></A>In One God the Father Almighty</span>,&#8221; ought also to believe in His Only-begotten Son.&#160; For <i>he that denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1114"></A><A HREF="#fn_1114"><FONT SIZE="1">1115</FONT></A>
.&#160; <i>I am the Door</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1115"></A><A HREF="#fn_1115"><FONT SIZE="1">1116</FONT></A>
, saith Jesus; <i>no one cometh unto the Father but through Me</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1116"></A><A HREF="#fn_1116"><FONT SIZE="1">1117</FONT></A>
.&#160; For if thou deny the Door, the knowledge concerning the Father is shut off from thee.&#160; <i>No man knoweth the father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son shall reveal Him</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1117"></A><A HREF="#fn_1117"><FONT SIZE="1">1118</FONT></A>
.&#160; For if thou deny Him who reveals, thou remainest in ignorance.&#160; There is a sentence in the Gospels, saying, <i>He that believeth not on the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1118"></A><A HREF="#fn_1118"><FONT SIZE="1">1119</FONT></A>
&#160; For the Father hath indignation when the Only-begotten Son is set at nought.&#160; For it is grievous to a king that merely his soldier should be dishonoured; and when one of his nobler officers or friends is dishonoured, then his anger is greatly increased:&#160; but if any should do despite to the king&#146;s only-begotten son himself, who shall appease the father&#146;s indignation on behalf of his only-begotten son?</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p11"></A>2.&#160; If, therefore, any one wishes to shew piety towards God, let him worship the Son, since otherwise the Father accepts not his service.&#160; The Father spake with a loud voice from heaven, saying, <i>This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1119"></A><A HREF="#fn_1119"><FONT SIZE="1">1120</FONT></A>
.&#160; The Father was well pleased; unless thou also be well pleased in Him, thou hast not life.&#160; Be not thou carried away with the Jews when they craftily say, There is one God alone; but with the knowledge that God is One, know that there is also an Only-begotten Son of God.&#160; I am not the first to say this, but the Psalmist in the person of the Son saith, <i>The Lord said unto Me, Thou art My Son</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1120"></A><A HREF="#fn_1120"><FONT SIZE="1">1121</FONT></A>
.&#160; Heed not therefore what the Jews say, but what the Prophets say.&#160; Dost thou wonder that they who stoned and slew the Prophets, set at nought the Prophets&#146; words?</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p14"></A>3.&#160; Believe thou <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p14.1"></A>In One Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of God</span>.&#160; For we say &#8220;One Lord Jesus Christ,&#8221; that His Sonship may be &#8220;Only-begotten:&#8221;&#160; we say &#8220;One,&#8221; that thou mayest not suppose another:&#160; we say &#8220;One,&#8221; that thou mayest not profanely diffuse the many names&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1121"></A><A HREF="#fn_1121"><FONT SIZE="1">1122</FONT></A>
 of His action among many sons.&#160; For He is called a Door&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1122"></A><A HREF="#fn_1122"><FONT SIZE="1">1123</FONT></A>
; but take not the name literally for a thing of wood, but a spiritual, a living Door, discriminating those who enter in.&#160; He is called a Way&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1123"></A><A HREF="#fn_1123"><FONT SIZE="1">1124</FONT></A>
, not one trodden by feet, but leading to the Father in heaven; He is called a Sheep&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1124"></A><A HREF="#fn_1124"><FONT SIZE="1">1125</FONT></A>
, not an irrational one, but the one which through its precious blood cleanses the world from its sins, which is led before the shearers, and knows when to be silent.&#160; This Sheep again is called a Shepherd, who says, <i>I am the Good Shepherd</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1125"></A><A HREF="#fn_1125"><FONT SIZE="1">1126</FONT></A>
:&#160; a Sheep because of His manhood, a Shepherd because of the loving-kindness of His Godhead.&#160; And wouldst thou know that there are rational sheep? the Saviour says to the Apostles, <i>Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1126"></A><A HREF="#fn_1126"><FONT SIZE="1">1127</FONT></A>
.&#160; Again, He is called a Lion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1127"></A><A HREF="#fn_1127"><FONT SIZE="1">1128</FONT></A>
, not as a devourer of men, but indicating as it were by the title His kingly, and stedfast, and confident nature:&#160; a Lion He is also called in opposition to the lion our adver<A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xiv-Page_58"></A>sary, who roars and devours those who have been deceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1128"></A><A HREF="#fn_1128"><FONT SIZE="1">1129</FONT></A>
.&#160; For the Saviour came, not as having changed the gentleness of His own nature, but as the strong <i>Lion of the tribe of Judah</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1129"></A><A HREF="#fn_1129"><FONT SIZE="1">1130</FONT></A>
, saving them that believe, but treading down the adversary.&#160; He is called a Stone, not a lifeless stone, cut out by men&#146;s hands, but a <i>chief corner-stone</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1130"></A><A HREF="#fn_1130"><FONT SIZE="1">1131</FONT></A>
, on whom <i>whosoever believeth shall not be put to shame</i>.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p25"></A>4.&#160; He is called <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p25.1"></A>Christ</span>, not as having been anointed by men&#146;s hands, but eternally anointed by the Father to His High-Priesthood on behalf of men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1131"></A><A HREF="#fn_1131"><FONT SIZE="1">1132</FONT></A>
.&#160; He is called Dead, not as having abode among the dead, as all in Hades, but as being alone <i>free among the dead</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1132"></A><A HREF="#fn_1132"><FONT SIZE="1">1133</FONT></A>
.&#160; He is called Son of Man, not as having had His generation from earth, as each of us, but as coming upon the clouds <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p27.2"></A>To Judge Both Quick and Dead&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1133"></A><A HREF="#fn_1133"><FONT SIZE="1">1134</FONT></A>
</span>.&#160; He is called <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p28.2"></A>Lord</span>, not improperly as those who are so called among men, but as having a natural and eternal Lordship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1134"></A><A HREF="#fn_1134"><FONT SIZE="1">1135</FONT></A>
.&#160; He is called <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p29.1"></A>Jesus</span> by a fitting name, as having the appellation from His salutary healing.&#160; He is called <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p29.2"></A>Son</span>, not as advanced by adoption, but as naturally begotten.&#160; And many are the titles of our Saviour; lest, therefore, His manifold appellations should make thee think of many sons, and because of the errors of the heretics, who say that Christ is one, and Jesus another, and the Door another, and so on&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1135"></A><A HREF="#fn_1135"><FONT SIZE="1">1136</FONT></A>
, the Faith secures thee beforehand, saying well, <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p30.1"></A>In One Lord Jesus Christ</span>:&#160; for though the titles are many, yet their subject is one.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p31"></A>5.&#160; But the Saviour comes in various forms to each man for his profit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1136"></A><A HREF="#fn_1136"><FONT SIZE="1">1137</FONT></A>
.&#160; For to those who have need of gladness He becomes a Vine; and to those who want to enter in He stands as a Door; and to those who need to offer up their prayers He stands a mediating High Priest.&#160; Again, to those who have sins He becomes a Sheep, that He may be sacrificed for them.&#160; <i>He is made all things to all men</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1137"></A><A HREF="#fn_1137"><FONT SIZE="1">1138</FONT></A>
, remaining in His own nature what He is.&#160; For so remaining, and holding the dignity of His Sonship in reality unchangeable, He adapts Himself to our infirmities, just as some excellent physician or compassionate teacher; though He is Very Lord, and received not the Lordship by advancement&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1138"></A><A HREF="#fn_1138"><FONT SIZE="1">1139</FONT></A>
, but has the dignity of His Lordship from nature, and is not called Lord improperly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1139"></A><A HREF="#fn_1139"><FONT SIZE="1">1140</FONT></A>
, as we are, but is so in verity, since by the Father&#146;s bidding&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1140"></A><A HREF="#fn_1140"><FONT SIZE="1">1141</FONT></A>
 He is Lord of His own works.&#160; For our lordship is over men of equal rights and like passions, nay often over our elders, and often a young master rules over aged servants.&#160; But in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lordship is not so:&#160; but He is first Maker, then Lord&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1141"></A><A HREF="#fn_1141"><FONT SIZE="1">1142</FONT></A>
:&#160; first He made all things by the Father&#146;s will, then, He is Lord of the things which were made by Him.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p42"></A>6.&#160; <i>Christ the Lord</i> is He who was <i>born in the city of David</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1142"></A><A HREF="#fn_1142"><FONT SIZE="1">1143</FONT></A>
.&#160; And wouldest thou know <A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xiv-Page_59"></A>that Christ is Lord with the Father even before His Incarnation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1143"></A><A HREF="#fn_1143"><FONT SIZE="1">1144</FONT></A>
, that thou mayest not only accept the statement by faith, but mayest also receive proof from the Old Testament?&#160; Go to the first book, Genesis:&#160; God saith, <i>Let us make man</i>, not &#145;in My image,&#146; but, <i>in Our image</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1144"></A><A HREF="#fn_1144"><FONT SIZE="1">1145</FONT></A>
.&#160; And after Adam was made, the sacred writer says, <i>And God created man; in the image of God created He him</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1145"></A><A HREF="#fn_1145"><FONT SIZE="1">1146</FONT></A>
.&#160; For he did not limit the dignity of the Godhead to the Father alone, but included the Son also:&#160; that it might be shewn that man is not only the work of God, but also of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is Himself also Very God.&#160; This Lord, who works together with the Father, wrought with Him also in the case of Sodom, according to the Scripture:&#160; <i>And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1146"></A><A HREF="#fn_1146"><FONT SIZE="1">1147</FONT></A>
.&#160; This Lord is He who afterwards was seen of Moses, as much as he was able to see.&#160; For the Lord is loving unto man, ever condescending to our infirmities.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p48"></A>7.&#160; Moreover, that you may be sure that this is He who was seen of Moses, hear Paul&#146;s testimony, when he says, <i>For they all drank of a spiritual rock that followed them; and the rock was Christ</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1147"></A><A HREF="#fn_1147"><FONT SIZE="1">1148</FONT></A>
.&#160; And again:&#160; <i>By faith Moses forsook Egypt</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1148"></A><A HREF="#fn_1148"><FONT SIZE="1">1149</FONT></A>
, and shortly after he says, <i>accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1149"></A><A HREF="#fn_1149"><FONT SIZE="1">1150</FONT></A>
.&#160; This Moses says to Him, <i>Shew me Thyself</i>.&#160; Thou seest that the Prophets also in those times saw the Christ, that is, as far as each was able.<i>&#160; Shew me Thyself, that I may see Thee with understanding</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1150"></A><A HREF="#fn_1150"><FONT SIZE="1">1151</FONT></A>
.&#160; But He saith, <i>There shall no man see My face, and live</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1151"></A><A HREF="#fn_1151"><FONT SIZE="1">1152</FONT></A>
.&#160; For this reason then, because no man could see the face of the Godhead and live, He took on Him the face of human nature, that we might see this and live.&#160; And yet when He wished to shew even that with a little majesty, when <i>His face did shine as the sun</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1152"></A><A HREF="#fn_1152"><FONT SIZE="1">1153</FONT></A>
, the disciples fell down affrighted.&#160; If then His bodily countenance, shining not in the full power of Him that wrought, but according to the capacity of the Disciples, affrighted them, so that even thus they could not bear it, how could any man gaze upon the majesty of the Godhead?&#160; &#145;A great thing,&#146; saith the Lord, &#145;thou desirest, O Moses:&#160; and I approve thine insatiable desire, <i>and I will do this thing</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1153"></A><A HREF="#fn_1153"><FONT SIZE="1">1154</FONT></A>
 for thee, but according as thou art able.&#160; <i>Behold, I will put thee in the clift of the rock</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">1155</FONT></A>
:&#160; for as being little, thou shalt lodge in a little space.&#146;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p57"></A>8.&#160; Now here I wish you to make safe what I am going to say, because of the Jews.&#160; For our object is to prove that the Lord Jesus Christ was with the Father.&#160; The <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p57.1"></A>Lord</span> then says to Moses, <i>I will pass by before thee with My glory, and will proclaim the name of the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p57.2"></A>Lord</span> before thee</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1155"></A><A HREF="#fn_1155"><FONT SIZE="1">1156</FONT></A>
.&#160; Being Himself the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p58.3"></A>Lord</span>, what <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p58.4"></A>Lord</span> doth He proclaim?&#160; Thou seest how He was covertly teaching the godly doctrine of the Father and the Son.&#160; And again, in what follows it is written word for word:&#160; <i>And the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p58.5"></A>Lord</span> descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p58.6"></A>Lord</span>.&#160; And the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p58.7"></A>Lord</span> passed by before him, and proclaimed, The <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p58.8"></A>Lord</span>, the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p58.9"></A>Lord</span> God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, both keeping righteousness and shewing mercy unto thousands, taking away iniquities, and transgressions, and sins</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1156"></A><A HREF="#fn_1156"><FONT SIZE="1">1157</FONT></A>
.&#160; Then in what follows, <i>Moses bowed his head and worshipped</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1157"></A><A HREF="#fn_1157"><FONT SIZE="1">1158</FONT></A>
 before the Lord who proclaimed the Father, and said:&#160; Go Thou then, O Lord, in the midst of us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1158"></A><A HREF="#fn_1158"><FONT SIZE="1">1159</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p62"></A>9.&#160; This is the first proof:&#160; receive now a second plain one.&#160; <i>The <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p62.1"></A>Lord</span> said unto my Lord, sit Thou on My right hand</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1159"></A><A HREF="#fn_1159"><FONT SIZE="1">1160</FONT></A>
.&#160; The <span class="sc"><a name="ii.xiv-p63.3"></A>Lord</span> says this to the Lord, not to a servant, but to the Lord of all, and His own Son, to whom He put all things in subjection.&#160; <i>But when He saith that all things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted, which did put all things under Him</i>, and what follows; <i>that God may be all in all</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1160"></A><A HREF="#fn_1160"><FONT SIZE="1">1161</FONT></A>
.&#160; The Only-begotten Son is Lord of all, but the obedient Son of the Father, for He grasped not the Lordship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1161"></A><A HREF="#fn_1161"><FONT SIZE="1">1162</FONT></A>
, but received it by nature of the Father&#146;s own will.&#160; For neither did the Son grasp it, nor the Father grudge to impart it.&#160; He it is who saith, <i>All things are delivered unto Me of My Father</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1162"></A><A HREF="#fn_1162"><FONT SIZE="1">1163</FONT></A>
; &#8220;delivered unto Me, not as though <A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xiv-Page_60"></A>I had them not before; and I keep them well, not robbing Him who hath given them.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p68"></A>10.&#160; The Son of God then is Lord: &#160;He is Lord, who was born in Bethlehem of Jud&aelig;a, according to the Angel who said to the shepherds, <i>I bring you good tidings of great joy, that unto you is born this day in the city of David Christ the Lord</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1163"></A><A HREF="#fn_1163"><FONT SIZE="1">1164</FONT></A>
:&#160; of whom an Apostle says elsewhere, <i>The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching the gospel of peace by Jesus Christ:&#160; He is Lord of all</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1164"></A><A HREF="#fn_1164"><FONT SIZE="1">1165</FONT></A>
.&#160; But when he says, <i>of all</i>, do thou except nothing from His Lordship:&#160; for whether Angels, or Archangels, or principalities, or powers, or any created thing named by the Apostles, all are under the Lordship of the Son.&#160; Of Angels He is Lord, as thou hast it in the Gospels, <i>Then the Devil departed from Him, and the Angels came and ministered unto Him</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1165"></A><A HREF="#fn_1165"><FONT SIZE="1">1166</FONT></A>
; for the Scripture saith not, they succoured Him, but they <i>ministered unto Him</i>, that is, like servants.&#160; When He was about to be born of a Virgin, Gabriel was then His servant, having received His service as a peculiar dignity.&#160; When He was about to go into Egypt, that He might overthrow the gods of Egypt made with hands&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1166"></A><A HREF="#fn_1166"><FONT SIZE="1">1167</FONT></A>
, again <i>an Angel appeareth to Joseph in a dream</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1167"></A><A HREF="#fn_1167"><FONT SIZE="1">1168</FONT></A>
.&#160; After He had been crucified, and had risen again, an Angel brought the good tidings, and as a trustworthy servant said to the women, <i>Go, tell His disciples that He is risen, and goeth before you into Galilee; lo, I have told you</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1168"></A><A HREF="#fn_1168"><FONT SIZE="1">1169</FONT></A>
:&#160; almost as if he had said, &#8220;I have not neglected my command, I protest that I have told you; that if ye disregard it, the blame may not be on me, but on those who disregard it.&#8221;&#160; This then is the One Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the lesson just now read speaks:&#160; <i>For though there be many that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth</i>, and so on, <i>yet to us there is One God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and One Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1169"></A><A HREF="#fn_1169"><FONT SIZE="1">1170</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p76"></A>11.&#160; And He is called by two names, Jesus Christ; Jesus, because He saves,&#8212;Christ, because He is a Priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1170"></A><A HREF="#fn_1170"><FONT SIZE="1">1171</FONT></A>
.&#160; And knowing this the inspired Prophet Moses conferred these two titles on two men distinguished above all&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1171"></A><A HREF="#fn_1171"><FONT SIZE="1">1172</FONT></A>
:&#160; his own successor in the government, Auses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1172"></A><A HREF="#fn_1172"><FONT SIZE="1">1173</FONT></A>
, he renamed Jesus; and his own brother Aaron he surnamed Christ&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1173"></A><A HREF="#fn_1173"><FONT SIZE="1">1174</FONT></A>
, that by two well-approved men he might represent at once both the High Priesthood, and the Kingship of the One Jesus Christ who was to come.&#160; For Christ is a High Priest like Aaron; since He <i>glorified not Himself to be made a High Priest, but He that spake unto Him, Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1174"></A><A HREF="#fn_1174"><FONT SIZE="1">1175</FONT></A>
.&#160; And Jesus the son of Nave was in many things a type of Him.&#160; For when he began to rule over the people, he began from Jordan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1175"></A><A HREF="#fn_1175"><FONT SIZE="1">1176</FONT></A>
, whence Christ also, after He was baptized, began to preach the gospel.&#160; And the son of Nave appoints twelve to divide the inheritance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1176"></A><A HREF="#fn_1176"><FONT SIZE="1">1177</FONT></A>
; and twelve Apostles Jesus sends forth, as heralds of the truth, into all the world.&#160; The typical Jesus saved Rahab the harlot when she believed:&#160; and the true Jesus says, <i>Behold, the publicans and the harlots go before you into the kingdom of God</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1177"></A><A HREF="#fn_1177"><FONT SIZE="1">1178</FONT></A>
.&#160; With only a shout the walls of Jericho fell down in the time of the type: &#160;and because Jesus said, <i>There shall not be left here one stone upon another</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1178"></A><A HREF="#fn_1178"><FONT SIZE="1">1179</FONT></A>
, the Temple of the Jews opposite to us is fallen, the cause of its fall not being the denunciation but the sin of the transgressors.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p86"></A>12.&#160; There is One Lord Jesus Christ, a wondrous name, indirectly announced beforehand by the Prophets.&#160; For Esaias the Prophet says, <i>Behold, thy Saviour cometh, having His own reward</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1179"></A><A HREF="#fn_1179"><FONT SIZE="1">1180</FONT></A>
.&#160; Now Jesus in Hebrew is by interpretation <i>Saviour</i>.&#160; For the Prophetic gift, foreseeing the murderous spirit of the Jews against their Lord&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1180"></A><A HREF="#fn_1180"><FONT SIZE="1">1181</FONT></A>
, veiled His name, lest from knowing it plainly beforehand they might plot against Him readily.&#160; But He was openly called Jesus not by men, but by an Angel, who came not by his own authority, but was sent by the power of God, and said to Joseph, <i>Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is con</i><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xiv-Page_61"></A><i>ceivedin her is of the Holy Ghost.&#160; And she shall bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1181"></A><A HREF="#fn_1181"><FONT SIZE="1">1182</FONT></A>
.&#160; And immediately he renders the reason of this name, saying, <i>for He shall save His people from their sins</i>.&#160; Consider how He who was not yet born could have a <i>people</i>, unless He was in being before He was born&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1182"></A><A HREF="#fn_1182"><FONT SIZE="1">1183</FONT></A>
.&#160; This also the Prophet says in His person, <i>From the bowels of my mother hath He made mention of My name</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1183"></A><A HREF="#fn_1183"><FONT SIZE="1">1184</FONT></A>
; because the Angel foretold that He should be called Jesus.&#160; And again concerning Herod&#146;s plot again he says, <i>And under the shadow of His hand hath He hid Me</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1184"></A><A HREF="#fn_1184"><FONT SIZE="1">1185</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p93"></A>13.&#160; Jesus then means according to the Hebrew &#8220;Saviour,&#8221; but in the Greek tongue &#8220;The Healer;&#8221; since He is physician of souls and bodies, curer of spirits, curing the blind in body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1185"></A><A HREF="#fn_1185"><FONT SIZE="1">1186</FONT></A>
, and leading minds into light, healing the visibly lame, and guiding sinners&#146; steps to repentance, saying to the palsied, <i>Sin no more</i>, and, <i>Take up thy bed and walk</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1186"></A><A HREF="#fn_1186"><FONT SIZE="1">1187</FONT></A>
.&#160; For since the body was palsied for the sin of the soul, He ministered first to the soul that He might extend the healing to the body.&#160; If, therefore, any one is suffering in soul from sins, there is the Physician for him:&#160; and if any one here is of little faith, let him say to Him, <i>Help Thou mine unbelief</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1187"></A><A HREF="#fn_1187"><FONT SIZE="1">1188</FONT></A>
.&#160; If any is encompassed also with bodily ailments, let him not be faithless, but let him draw nigh; for to such diseases also Jesus ministers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1188"></A><A HREF="#fn_1188"><FONT SIZE="1">1189</FONT></A>
, and let him learn that Jesus is the Christ.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p98"></A>14.&#160; For that He is Jesus the Jews allow, but not further that He is Christ.&#160; Therefore saith the Apostle, <i>Who is the liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1189"></A><A HREF="#fn_1189"><FONT SIZE="1">1190</FONT></A>
?&#160; But Christ is a High Priest, <i>whose priesthood passes not to another</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1190"></A><A HREF="#fn_1190"><FONT SIZE="1">1191</FONT></A>
, neither having begun His Priesthood in time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1191"></A><A HREF="#fn_1191"><FONT SIZE="1">1192</FONT></A>
, nor having any successor in His High-Priesthood:&#160; as thou heardest on the Lord&#146;s day, when we were discoursing in the congregation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1192"></A><A HREF="#fn_1192"><FONT SIZE="1">1193</FONT></A>
 on the phrase, <i>After the Order of Melchizedek</i>.&#160; He received not the High-Priesthood from bodily succession, nor was He anointed with oil prepared by man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1193"></A><A HREF="#fn_1193"><FONT SIZE="1">1194</FONT></A>
, but before all ages by the Father; and He so far excels the others as <i>with an oath</i> He is made Priest:&#160; <i>For they are priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him that said, The Lord sware, and will not repent</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1194"></A><A HREF="#fn_1194"><FONT SIZE="1">1195</FONT></A>
.&#160; The mere purpose of the Father was sufficient for surety:&#160; but the mode of assurance is twofold, namely that with the purpose there follows the oath also, <i>that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong encouragement</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1195"></A><A HREF="#fn_1195"><FONT SIZE="1">1196</FONT></A>
 for our faith, who receive Christ Jesus as the Son of God.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p106"></A>15.&#160; This Christ, when He was come, the Jews denied, but the devils confessed.&#160; But His forefather David was not ignorant of Him, when he said, <i>I have ordained a lamp for mine Anointed</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1196"></A><A HREF="#fn_1196"><FONT SIZE="1">1197</FONT></A>
:&#160; which lamp some have interpreted to be the brightness of Prophecy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1197"></A><A HREF="#fn_1197"><FONT SIZE="1">1198</FONT></A>

.&#160; Moses also knew Him, Isaiah knew Him, and Jeremiah; not one of the Prophets was ignorant of Him.&#160; Even devils recognised Him, for He rebuked them, and the Scripture says, <i>because they knew that He was Christ</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1200"></A><A HREF="#fn_1200"><FONT SIZE="1">1201</FONT></A>
.&#160; The Chief-priests knew Him not, and the devils confessed Him:&#160; the Chief Priests knew Him not, and a woman of Samaria proclaimed Him, saying, <i>Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did.&#160; Is not this the Christ</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1201"></A><A HREF="#fn_1201"><FONT SIZE="1">1202</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ii.xiv-p113"></A>16.&#160; This is Jesus Christ who came <i>a High-Priest of the good things to come</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1202"></A><A HREF="#fn_1202"><FONT SIZE="1">1203</FONT></A>
; who for the bountifulness of His Godhead imparted His own title to us all.&#160; For kings among men have their royal style which others may not share:&#160; but Jesus Christ being the Son of God gave us the dignity of being called Christians.&#160; But some one will say, The name of &#8220;Christians&#8221; is new, and was not in use aforetime&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1203"></A><A HREF="#fn_1203"><FONT SIZE="1">1204</FONT></A>
:&#160; and new-fashioned phrases are often objected to <A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A> <a name="ii.xiv-Page_62"></A>on the score of strangeness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1204"></A><A HREF="#fn_1204"><FONT SIZE="1">1205</FONT></A>
.&#160; The prophet made this point safe beforehand, saying, <i>But upon My servants shall a new name be called, which shall be blessed upon the earth</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1205"></A><A HREF="#fn_1205"><FONT SIZE="1">1206</FONT></A>
.&#160; Let us question the Jews:&#160; Are ye servants of the Lord, or not?&#160; Shew then your new name.&#160; For ye were called Jews and Israelites in the time of Moses, and the other prophets, and after the return from Babylon, and up to the present time:&#160; where then is your new name?&#160; But we, since we are servants of the Lord, have that new name:&#160; <i>new</i> indeed, but the <i>new name, which shall be blessed upon the earth</i>.&#160; This name caught the world in its grasp:&#160; for Jews are only in a certain region, but Christians reach to the ends of the world:&#160; for it is the name of the Only-begotten Son of God that is proclaimed.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p118"></A>17.&#160; But wouldest thou know that the Apostles knew and preached the name of Christ, or rather had Christ Himself within them?&#160; Paul says to his hearers, <i>Or seek ye a proof of Christ that speaketh in me</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1206"></A><A HREF="#fn_1206"><FONT SIZE="1">1207</FONT></A>
?&#160; Paul proclaims Christ, saying, <i>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus&#146; sake</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1207"></A><A HREF="#fn_1207"><FONT SIZE="1">1208</FONT></A>
.&#160; Who then is this?&#160; The former persecutor.&#160; O mighty wonder!&#160; The former persecutor himself preaches Christ.&#160; But wherefore?&#160; Was he bribed?&#160; Nay there was none to use this mode of persuasion.&#160; But was it that he saw Him present on earth, and was abashed?&#160; He had already been taken up into heaven.&#160; He went forth to persecute, and after three days the persecutor is a preacher in Damascus.&#160; By what power?&#160; Others call friends as witnesses for friends but I have presented to you as a witness the former enemy:&#160; and dost thou still doubt?&#160; The testimony of Peter and John, though weighty, was yet of a kind open to suspicion:&#160; for they were His friends.&#160; But of one who was formerly his enemy, and afterwards dies for His sake, who can any longer doubt the truth?</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p121"></A>18.&#160; At this point of my discourse I am truly filled with wonder at the wise dispensation of the Holy Spirit; how He confined the Epistles of the rest to a small number, but to Paul the former persecutor gave the privilege of writing fourteen.&#160; For it was not because Peter or John was less that He restrained the gift; God forbid!&#160; But in order that the doctrine might be beyond question, He granted to the former enemy and persecutor the privilege of writing more, in order that we all might thus be made believers.&#160; For <i>all were amazed</i> at Paul, and said, <i>Is not this he that</i> was formerly a persecutor&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1208"></A><A HREF="#fn_1208"><FONT SIZE="1">1209</FONT></A>
?&#160; Did he not come hither, that he might lead us away bound to Jerusalem?&#160; Be not amazed, said Paul, I know that <i>it is hard for me to kick against the pricks:</i>&#160; I know that <i>I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1209"></A><A HREF="#fn_1209"><FONT SIZE="1">1210</FONT></A>
; but I did it <i>in ignorance</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1210"></A><A HREF="#fn_1210"><FONT SIZE="1">1211</FONT></A>
:&#160; for I thought that the preaching of Christ was destruction of the Law, and knew not that He came Himself to fulfil the Law and not to destroy it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1211"></A><A HREF="#fn_1211"><FONT SIZE="1">1212</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ii.xiv-p35"></A>The same doctrine had been previously held by the disciples of Paul of Samosata, who said that Christ was not originally God, but after His Incarnation was by advance (<span class="Greek"><a name="ii.xiv-p35.1"></A>&#7952;</span><span class="Greek"><a name="ii.xiv-p35.2"></A>&#954; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#8134;&#962;</span>) made God, from being made by nature a mere man:&#160; see Athanas.

<p><a name="ii.xiv-p38"></A> Origen (<i>De Principiis</i>, I. ii. 10) had argued that &#8220;even God cannot be called omnipotent, unless there exist those over whom He may exercise His power,&#8221; and therefore creation must have been eternal, or God could not have been eternally Omnipotent.&#160; In other passages Origen declares it an impiety to hold that matter is co-eternal with God (<i>De Princip</i>. II. i. 4), and yet maintains that there were other worlds before this, and that there was never a time when there was no world existing.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p39"></A>Methodius, in a fragment of his work <i>On things Created</i>, preserved by Photius, and quoted by Bishop Bull (<i>Def. Fid. Nic.</i> II. xiii. 9), argues against these theories of Origen, that in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#002">John i. 2</a><a name="ii.xiv-p39.1"></A> the words &#8220;The same was in the beginning with God&#8221; indicate the authority (<span class="Greek"><a name="ii.xiv-p39.2"></A>&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#957;</span>) of the Word which He had with the Father before the world came into existence; since from all eternity God the Father, together with His Word, possessed the Almighty power whereby whenever He would He could create worlds to rule over.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p40"></A>Dean Church remarks that &#8220;On the other hand Tertullian, <i>contra Hermog</i>. 3, considering the attributes in question to belong not to the Divine Nature, but Office, denies that God was Almighty (Lord?) from eternity; while the Greeks affirmed this (vid. Cyril Alex. <i>in Joann</i>. xvii. 8, p. 963; Athan. <i>Orat</i>. ii. 12&#8211;14), as understanding by the term the inherent but latent attribute of doing what He had not yet done, <span class="Greek"><a name="ii.xiv-p40.1"></A>&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#958;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8057;&#957;</span>.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.xiv-p41"></A>Cleopas, the Jerusalem Editor, regards the passage as directed against Paul of Samosata, who asserted that Christ had become God, and received His kingdom and Lordship only after His Incarnation, and remarks:&#8212;&#8220;S. Cyril evidently regards the Lordship of Jesus Christ as twofold:&#160; one that which from eternity belonged to Him as God, which he calls natural, according to which &#145;He was ever both Lord and King, as being by nature God&#146; (Cyril Alex. <i>in Johann</i>. cap. xvii.); and the other the Lordship in time relative to the creatures, by which He exercises dominion over the works created by Him, as being their Maker.&#8220;</p>

<p><a name="ii.xiv-p67"></A>Again (<i>contr. Arian. Orat</i>. III. cap. xxvii. &sect; 36), Athanasius argues:&#160; &#8220;Lest a man, perceiving that the Son has all that the Father hath, from the exact likeness and identity of what He hath, should wander into the impiety of Sabellius, considering Him to be the Father, therefore He has said, <i>Was given unto Me</i>, and <i>I received</i>, and <i>Were delivered to Me</i>, only to shew that He is not the Father, but the Father&#146;s Word, and the Eternal Son, who, because of His likeness to the Father, has eternally what He has from Him, and because He is the Son, has from the Father what eternally He hath.&#8221;</p>
