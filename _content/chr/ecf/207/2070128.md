id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Ep. XXXVII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>(A letter of recommendation for
Eudoxius a Rhetorician for whom Gregory had a warm regard.)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.iv-p3"></span>To honour a mother is a religious
duty.  Now, different individuals have different mothers; but the common
mother of all is our country.  This mother you have honoured by the
splendour of your whole life; and you will honour her again now by
obtaining for me that which I entreat.  And what is my request?  You
certainly know Eudoxius the Rhetorician, the most learned of her sons. 
His son, to speak concisely, another Eudoxius both in life and learning,
now approaches you through me.  In order then to get yourself a yet
better name, be helpful to him in the matters for which he asks your
assistance.  For it were a shame were you, who are the universal Patron
of our Country, and who have done good to so many, and I will add, who
will yet continue to do so, should not honour above all him who is most
excellent in learning and in his eloquence, which you ought to honour,
if for no other reason, because he uses it to praise your goodness.
