id="iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Gregory Nazianzen.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c21"><span
id="iii.iii-p2.1"></span>Oration I.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p3"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iii-p3.1"></span>On Easter and His Reluctance.</span>

<span id="iii.iii-p4"></span>I.  <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p4.1"></span>It</span> is the Day of the Resurrection, and
my Beginning has good auspices.  Let us then keep the Festival with
splendour, <span id="fr_2528"></span>[2529](#fn_2528) and let us embrace
one another.  Let us say Brethren, even to those who hate us; much more
to those who have done or suffered aught out of love for us.  Let us
forgive all offences for the Resurrection’s sake:  let us give one
another pardon, I for the noble tyranny which I have suffered (for I can
now call it noble); and you who exercised it, if you had cause to blame
my tardiness; for perhaps this tardiness may be more precious in God’s
sight than the haste of others.  For it is a good thing even to hold
back from God for a little while, as did the great Moses of old, <span
id="fr_2529"></span>[2530](#fn_2529) and Jeremiah <span
id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530) later on; and then to run readily
to Him when He calls, as did Aaron <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531) and Isaiah, <span
id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532) so only both be done in a dutiful
spirit;—the former because of his own want of strength; the latter
because of the Might of Him That calleth.

<span id="iii.iii-p10"></span>II.  A Mystery <span
id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533) anointed me; I withdrew a little
while at a Mystery, as much as was needful to examine myself; now I come
in with a Mystery, bringing with me the Day as a good defender of my
cowardice and weakness; that He Who to-day rose again from the dead may
renew me also by His Spirit; and, clothing me with the new Man, may give
me to His New Creation, to those who are begotten after God, as a good
modeller and teacher for Christ, willingly both dying with Him and
rising again with Him.

<span id="iii.iii-p12"></span>III.  Yesterday the Lamb was slain and the
door-posts were anointed, <span id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534) and
Egypt bewailed her Firstborn, and the Destroyer passed us over, and the
Seal was dreadful and reverend, and we were walled in with the Precious
Blood.  To-day we have clean escaped from Egypt and from Pharaoh; and
there is none to hinder us from keeping a Feast to the Lord our God—the
Feast of our Departure; or from celebrating that Feast, not in the old
leaven of malice and wickedness, but in the unleavened bread of
sincerity and truth, <span id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535) carrying
with us nothing of ungodly and Egyptian leaven.

<span id="iii.iii-p15"></span>IV.  Yesterday I was crucified with Him;
today I am glorified with Him; yesterday I died with Him; to-day I am
quickened with Him; yesterday I was buried with Him; to-day I rise with
Him.  But let us offer to Him Who suffered and rose again for us—you
will think perhaps that I am going to say gold, or silver, or woven work
or transparent and costly stones, the mere passing material of earth,
that remains here below, and is for the most part always possessed by
bad men, slaves of the world and of the Prince of the world.  Let us
offer *ourselves*, the possession most precious to God, and most
fitting; let us give back to the Image what is made after the Image. 
Let us recognize our Dignity; let us honour our Archetype; let us know
the power of the Mystery, and for what Christ died.

<span id="iii.iii-p16"></span>V.  Let us become like Christ, since
Christ became like us.  Let us become God’s for His sake, since He for
ours became Man.  He assumed the worse that He might give us the better;
He became poor that we through His poverty might be rich; <span
id="fr_2536"></span>[2537](#fn_2536) He took upon Him the form of a
servant that we might receive back our liberty; He came down that we
might be exalted; He was tempted that we might conquer; He was
dishonoured that He might glorify us; He died that He might save us; He
ascended that He might draw to Himself us, who were lying low in the
Fall of sin.  Let us give *all*, offer *all*, to Him Who gave Himself a
Ransom and a Reconciliation for us.  But one can give nothing like
oneself, understanding the Mystery, and becoming for His sake all that
He became for ours.

<span id="iii.iii-p18"></span><span id="page_204">p. 204</span> <span
id="iii.iii-Page_204"></span>VI.  As you see, He offers you a Shepherd;
for this is what your Good Shepherd, <span
id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537) who lays down his life for his
sheep, is hoping and praying for, and he asks from you his subjects; and
he gives you himself double instead of single, and makes the staff of
his old age a staff for your spirit.  And he adds to the inanimate
temple a living one; to that exceedingly beautiful and heavenly shrine,
this poor and small one, <span id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538) yet
to him of great value, and built too with much sweat and many labours. 
Would that I could say it is worthy of his labours.  And he places at
your disposal all that belongs to him (O great generosity!—or it would
be truer to say, O fatherly love!) his hoar hairs, his youth, the
temple, the high priest, the testator, the heir, the discourses which
you were longing for; and of these not such as are vain and poured out
into the air, and which reach no further than the outward ear; but those
which the Spirit writes and engraves on tables of stone, or of flesh,
not merely superficially graven, nor easily to be rubbed off, but marked
very deep, not with ink, but with grace.

<span id="iii.iii-p21"></span>VII.  These are the gifts given you by
this august Abraham, this honourable and reverend Head, this Patriarch,
this Restingplace of all good, this Standard of virtue, this Perfection
of the Priesthood, who to-day is bringing to the Lord his willing
Sacrifice, his only Son, <span id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539) him
of the promise.  Do you on your side offer to God and to us obedience to
your Pastors, dwelling in a place of herbage, and being fed by water of
refreshment; <span id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540) knowing your
Shepherd well, and being known by him; <span
id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541) and following when he calls you as
a Shepherd frankly through the door; but not following a stranger
climbing up into the fold like a robber and a traitor; nor listening to
a strange voice when such would take you away by stealth and scatter you
from the truth on mountains, <span id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542)
and in deserts, and pitfalls, and places which the Lord does not visit;
and would lead you away from the sound Faith in the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost, the One Power and Godhead, Whose Voice my sheep always
heard (and may they always hear it), but with deceitful and corrupt
words would tear them from their true Shepherd.  From which may we all
be kept, Shepherd and flock, as from a poisoned and deadly pasture;
guiding and being guided far away from it, that we may all be one in
Christ Jesus our Lord, now and unto the heavenly rest.  To Whom be the
glory and the might for ever and ever.  Amen.

<span id="iii.iii-p19"></span> <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p19.1"></span>Nicetas</span> says that this refers to <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iii-p19.2"></span>S. Gregory’s</span> Father,
who had ordained him Priest, to assist him in the Cure of Souls, and
whose one desire was that his Son might succeed him in the Bishopric.

<span id="fn_2538"></span>[204:2539](2070046.htm#fr_2538) <span
id="iii.iii-p19.3"></span>

<span id="iii.iii-p20"></span> <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p20.1"></span>S. Gregory’s</span> father had, according to
the same authority, rebuilt the Church at Nazianus with great
splendour.  He thinks that the expression “heavenly” may refer to the
great dome.  The “living temple” is of course S. Gregory himself.

<span id="fn_2539"></span>[204:2540](2070046.htm#fr_2539) <span
id="iii.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii-p22"></span> <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p22.1"></span>S. Gregory</span> had an elder sister <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iii-p22.2"></span>Gorgonia</span>, and a
younger brother <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iii-p22.3"></span>Cæsarius</span>, so that this expression must
not be taken too literally, but is rather to be read in connection with
the “promise,” his Mother having looked upon his birth as a special
answer to prayer, and having dedicated him to God from his infancy.
