Gregory succeeded at the end of <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.vii.ix-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 382 in convincing the Metropolitan and his Comprovincials of his sincerity in desiring to retire; and so they began to cast about for a Successor.&#160; Gregory desired that his cousin the <A NAME="page_474"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 474</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.vii.ix-Page_474"></A>Chorepiscopus Eulalius should be nominated, but the Bishops felt some jealousy at what they took to be an attempt on his part to dictate to them, and refused to allow him to take any part in the election, on the ground that he either never had been, or at any rate had ceased to be one of the Bishops of the Province.&#160; He protested, but finding that he could not convince them he withdrew his claim to a vote and wrote to Theodore, as follows:&#8212;)</p>
