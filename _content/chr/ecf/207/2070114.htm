<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ii.v-p2"></A>(Basil the Great died Jan. 1, <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ii.v-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 379.&#160; Gregory of Nazianzus was prevented by very serious illness from attending his funeral, and therefore wrote as follows to Gregory of Nyssa.)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ii.v-p3"></A>This, then, was also reserved for my sad life, to hear of the death of Basil, and the departure <A NAME="page_461"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 461</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.ii.v-Page_461"></A>of that holy soul, which has gone from us that it may be with the Lord, for which he had been preparing himself all his life.&#160; And among all the other losses I have had to endure this is the greatest, that by reason of the bodily sickness from which I am still suffering and in great danger, I cannot kiss that holy dust, or be with you to enjoy the consolations of a just philosophy, and to comfort our common friends.&#160; But to see the desolation of the Church, shorn of such a glory, and bereft of such a crown, is what no one, at least no one of any feeling, can bear to let his eyes look upon, or his ear hearken to.&#160; But you, I think, though you have many friends and will receive many words of condolence, yet will not derive comfort so much from any as from yourself and your memory of him; for you two were a pattern to all of philosophy, a kind of spiritual standard, both of discipline in prosperity, and of endurance in adversity; for philosophy bears prosperity with moderation and adversity with dignity.&#160; This is what I have to say to Your Excellency.&#160; But for myself who write so, what time or what words shall comfort me, except your company and conversation, which our blessed one has left me in place of all, that seeing his character in you as in a bright and shining mirror, I may think myself to possess him also!</p>
