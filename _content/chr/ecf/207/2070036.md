<span id="ii.xxiv-p5"></span>Know ye not, that so many of us as were
baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death? &c..…for ye
are not under the Law, but under grace.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p6"></span>1.  <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxiv-p6.1"></span>These</span> daily introductions into the
Mysteries <span id="fr_2392"></span>[2393](#fn_2392) , and new
instructions, which are the announcements of new truths, are profitable
to us; and most of all to you, who have been renewed from an old state
to a new.  Therefore, I shall necessarily lay before you the sequel of
yesterday’s Lecture, that ye may learn of what those things, which were
done by you in the inner chamber <span
id="fr_2393"></span>[2394](#fn_2393) , were symbolical.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p9"></span>2.  As soon, then, as ye entered, ye put
off your tunic; and this was an image of *putting off the old man with
his deeds* <span id="fr_2394"></span>[2395](#fn_2394) .  Having stripped
yourselves, ye were naked; in this also imitating Christ, who was
stripped naked on the Cross, and by His nakedness *put off from Himself
the principalities and powers, and openly triumphed over them on the
tree* <span id="fr_2395"></span>[2396](#fn_2395) .  For since the
adverse powers made their lair in your members, ye may no longer wear
that old garment; I do not at all mean this visible one, but the *old
man, which waxeth corrupt in the lusts of deceit* <span
id="fr_2396"></span>[2397](#fn_2396) .  May the soul which has once put
him off, never again put him on, but say with the Spouse of Christ in
the Song of Songs, *I have put off my garment, how shall I put it
on* <span id="fr_2397"></span>[2398](#fn_2397) ?  O wondrous thing! ye
were naked in the sight of all, and were not ashamed <span
id="fr_2398"></span>[2399](#fn_2398) ; for truly ye bore the likeness of
the first-formed Adam, who was naked in the garden, and was not ashamed.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p15"></span>3.  Then, when ye were stripped, ye were
anointed with exorcised oil <span id="fr_2399"></span>[2400](#fn_2399) ,
from the very hairs of your head to your feet, and were made partakers
of the good olive-tree, Jesus Christ.  For ye were cut off from the wild
olive-tree <span id="fr_2400"></span>[2401](#fn_2400) , and grafted into
the good one, and were made to share the fatness of the true
olive-tree.  The exorcised oil therefore was a symbol of the
participation of the fatness of Christ, being a charm to drive away
every trace of hostile influence.  For as the breathing of the saints,
and the invocation of the Name of God, like fiercest flame, scorch and
drive out evil spirits <span id="fr_2401"></span>[2402](#fn_2401) , so
also this exorcised oil receives such virtue by the invocation of God
and by prayer, as not only to burn and cleanse away the traces of sins,
but also to chase away all the invisible powers of the evil one.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p19"></span>4.  After these things, ye were led to the
holy pool <span id="fr_2402"></span>[2403](#fn_2402) of Divine Baptism,
as Christ was carried from the Cross to the Sepulchre which is before
our eyes.  And each of you was asked, whether he believed in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and ye made that
saving confession, <span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span
id="ii.xxiv-Page_148"></span>and descended three times into the water,
and ascended again; here also hinting by a symbol at the three days
burial of Christ <span id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403) .  For as
our Saviour passed three days and three nights in the heart of the
earth, so you also in your first ascent out of the water, represented
the first day of Christ in the earth, and by your descent, the night;
for as he who is in the night, no longer sees, but he who is in the day,
remains in the light, so in the descent, as in the night, ye saw
nothing, but in ascending again ye were as in the day.  And at the
self-same moment ye were both dying and being born; and that Water of
salvation was at once your grave and your mother.  And what Solomon
spoke of others will suit you also; for he said, in that case, *There is
a time to bear and a time to die* <span
id="fr_2404"></span>[2405](#fn_2404) ; but to you, in the reverse order,
there was a time to die and a time to be born; and one and the same time
effected both of these, and your birth went hand in hand with your
death.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p24"></span>5.  O strange and inconceivable thing! we
did not really die, we were not really buried, we were not really
crucified and raised again; but our imitation was in a figure, and our
salvation in reality.  Christ was actually crucified, and actually
buried, and truly rose again; and all these things He has freely
bestowed upon us, that we, sharing His sufferings by imitation, might
gain salvation in reality.  O surpassing loving-kindness!  Christ
received nails in His undefiled hands and feet, and suffered anguish;
while on me without pain or toil by the fellowship of His suffering He
freely bestows salvation.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p25"></span>6.  Let no one then suppose that Baptism
is merely the grace of remission of sins, or further, that of adoption;
as John’s was a baptism <span id="fr_2405"></span>[2406](#fn_2405)
conferring only remission of sins:  whereas we know full well, that as
it purges our sins, and ministers <span
id="fr_2406"></span>[2407](#fn_2406) to us the gift of the Holy Ghost,
so also it is the counterpart <span id="fr_2407"></span>[2408](#fn_2407)
of the sufferings of Christ.  For this cause Paul just now cried aloud
and said, *Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ
Jesus, were baptized into His death?  We were buried therefore with Him
by baptism into His death* <span id="fr_2408"></span>[2409](#fn_2408) . 
These words he spoke to some who were disposed to think that Baptism
ministers to us the remission of sins, and adoption, but has not further
the fellowship also, by representation, of Christ’s true sufferings.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p30"></span>7.  In order therefore that we might
learn, that whatsoever things Christ endured, <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxiv-p30.1"></span>for us and for our salvation <span
id="fr_2409"></span>[2410](#fn_2409) </span> He suffered them in reality
and not in appearance, and that we also are made partakers of His
sufferings, Paul cried with all exactness of truth, *For if we have been
planted together with the likeness of His death, we shall be also with
the likeness of His resurrection*.  Well has he said, *planted
together* <span id="fr_2410"></span>[2411](#fn_2410) .  For since the
true Vine was planted in this place, we also by partaking in the Baptism
of death have been *planted together* with Him.  And fix thy mind with
much attention on the words of the Apostle.  He said not, “For if we
have been planted together with His death,” but, *with the likeness of
His death*.  For in Christ’s case there was death in reality, for His
soul was really separated from His body, and real burial, for His holy
body was wrapt in pure linen; and everything happened really to Him; but
in your case there was only a likeness of death and sufferings, whereas
of salvation there was not a likeness but a reality.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p33"></span>8.  Having been sufficiently instructed in
these things, keep them, I beseech you, in your remembrance; that I
also, unworthy though I be, may say of you, *Now I love you* <span
id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411) , *because ye always remember me,
and hold fast the traditions, which I delivered unto you*.  And God, who
has presented you *as it were alive from the dead* <span
id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412) , is able to grant unto you *to
walk in newness of life* <span id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413) : 
because His is the glory and the power, now and for ever.  Amen.

Cyril’s use of this passage agrees best with the interpretation that
Christ, having been clothed with the likeness of sinful flesh during His
life on earth, submitted therein to the assaults of the powers of evil,
but on the Cross threw off from Himself both it and them.

48:  *The Unclothing of the Catechumens*:  Bingh. *Ant*. XI. xi. 1:  All
“persons were baptized naked, either in imitation of Adam in Paradise,
or our Saviour upon the Cross, or to signify their putting off the body
of sin, and the old man with his deeds.”

<span id="ii.xxiv-p16"></span> Apost. Const. vii. 22:  “But thou shalt
beforehand anoint the person with holy oil (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiv-p16.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiv-p16.2"></span>λαίῳ</span>), and afterward baptize him with
water, and in the conclusion shalt seal him with the ointment (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.xxiv-p16.3"></span>μύρῳ</span>), that the
anointing (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiv-p16.4"></span>χρῖσμα</span>) may be a participation of the
Holy Spirit, and the water a symbol of the death, and the ointment the
seal of the Covenants.  But if there be neither oil nor ointment, water
suffices both for anointing, and for a seal, and for a confession of Him
who died, or indeed is dying with us.”  The previous anointing “with oil
sanctified by prayer” is mentioned in the *Clementine Recognitions*,
III. c. 67, and in the Pseudo-Justin, *Quæstiones ad Orthodoxos*, Qu.
137.  It was not however universal, and seems to have been unknown in
Africa, not being mentioned by Clement of Alexandria (*Pæd*. II. c.
viii. *On the use of ointments*), nor Tertullian, nor Augustine.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p20"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.xxiv-p20.1"></span>κολυμβήθραν</span>.  The pool or piscina was
deep enough for total immersion, and large enough for many to be
baptized at once.  Cf. Bingh. *Ant*. VIII. vii. 2; XI. xi. 2, 3.  For
engravings of the very ancient Baptisteries at Aquileia and Ravenna,
shewing the form of the font or piscina, see *Dict. Christian Ant*.
“Baptistery.”

<span id="fn_2403"></span>[148:2404](2070036.htm#fr_2403) <span
id="ii.xxiv-p20.2"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p21"></span> The same significance is attributed to
the trine immersion by many Fathers, but a different explanation is
given by Tertullian (*Adv. Praxean*, c. xxvi.):  “Not once only, but
three times, we are immersed into the several Persons at the mention of
their several names.”  Gregory of Nyssa (*On the Baptism of Christ*, p.
520 in this Series) joins both reasons together:  “By doing this thrice
we represent for ourselves that grace of the Resurrection which was
wrought in three days:  and this we do, not receiving the Sacrament in
silence, but while there are spoken over us the Names of the Three
Sacred Persons on whom we believed, &c.”  Compare p. 529.  Cf. *Apost.
Const* VIII. § 47, Can. 50:  “If any Bishop or Presbyter does not
perform the three immersions of one initiation, but one immersion made
into the death of Christ, let him be deprived.”

<span id="ii.xxiv-p22"></span>Milles in his note on this passage
mentions that “this form of Baptism is still used in the Greek Church. 
See Eucholog. p. 355.  Ed. Jac. Goar. and his notes p. 365.”

<span id="fn_2404"></span>[148:2405](2070036.htm#fr_2404) <span

<span id="fn_2405"></span>[148:2406](2070036.htm#fr_2405) <span
id="ii.xxiv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p26"></span> Tertullian (*De Baptismo*, c. 10) denies
that John’s Baptism availed for the remission of sins:  “If repentance
is a thing human, its baptism must necessarily be of the same nature: 
else if it had been celestial, it would have given both the Holy Spirit
and the remission of sins.”  Cyril’s doctrine is more in accordance with
the language of the Fathers generally, and of St. [Mark
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#004), [Luke
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003)<span id="ii.xxiv-p26.1"></span>.

sign or memorial of that which is past, and no longer actually present:

<span id="ii.xxiv-p29"></span> [Rom. vi.
3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003)<span id="ii.xxiv-p29.1"></span>.  In
the following sentence several <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.xxiv-p29.2"></span>mss.</span> have a different reading:  “These
things perhaps he said to some who were disposed to think that Baptism
ministers remission of sins only, and not adoption, and that further it
has not the fellowship, &c.”  Against this reading, approve by Milles,
the Benedictine Editor argues that in [Rom.
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)<span id="ii.xxiv-p29.3"></span>,
there is no reference to adoption, but only to the fellowship of
Christ’s Passion, and that Cyril quotes the passage only to prove the
latter, the gift of adoption being generally admitted, and therefore not
in question.

id="ii.xxiv-p30.2"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p31"></span> This clause is contained in the Nicene
Creed, and in that which was offered to the Council by Eusebius as the
ancient Creed of Cæsarea.  It probably formed part of the Creed of
Jerusalem, though it is not found in the titles of the Lectures, nor
specially explained.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p32"></span> [Rom.
6.5](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#005)<span id="ii.xxiv-p32.1"></span>. 
Cyril gives the phrase “*planted together*” a special application to
those who had been baptized in the same place where Christ had been
buried.
