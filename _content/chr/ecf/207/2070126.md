id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>Ep. XXII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>(Is for Amphilochius, written at the
same time and in consequence of the same trouble as that which we have
placed second of the letters to Cæsarius.)

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ii-p3"></span>As we know gold and stones by their
look, so too we may distinguish good men from bad in the same way, and
do not need a very long trial.  For I should not have needed many words
in pleading for my most honourable son Amphilochius with Your
Magnanimity.  I should rather have expected some strange and incredible
thing to happen than that he would do anything dishonourable, or think
of such a thing, in a matter of money; such a universal reputation has
he as a gentleman, and as wiser than his years.  But what must he
suffer?  Nothing escapes envy, for some word of blame has touched even
him, a man who has fallen under accusation of crime through simplicity
rather than depravity of disposition.  But do not allow it to be
tolerable to you to overlook him in his vexations and trouble.  Not so,
I entreat your sacred and great mind, but honour your country <span
id="fr_4746"></span>[4747](#fn_4746) and aid his virtue, and have a
respect for me who have attained to glory by and through you; and be
everything to this man, adding the will to the power, for I know that
there is nothing of equal power with Your Excellency.
