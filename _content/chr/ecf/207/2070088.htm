<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iii.ix-p2"></A>I did not write in an insolent spirit, as you complain of my letter, but rather in a spiritual and philosophical one, and as was fitting, unless this too wrongs &#8220;your most eloquent Gregory.&#8221;&#160; For though you are my Superior in rank, yet you will grant me something of liberty and just freedom of speech.&#160; Therefore be kinder to me.&#160; But if you regard my letter as coming from a servant, and from one who has not the right even to look you in the face, I will in this instance accept your stripes and not even shed a tear.&#160; Will you blame me for this also?&#160; That would befit anyone rather than your Reverence.&#160; For it is the part of a high-souled man to accept more readily the freedom of a friend than the flattery of an enemy.</p>
