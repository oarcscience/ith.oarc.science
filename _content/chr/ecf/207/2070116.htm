<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ii.vii-p2"></A>(Gregory after his resignation of the Patriarchal See of Constantinople had retired to Nazianzus, and had been persuaded to undertake the administration of the diocese then vacant, until the vacancy should be filled.&#160; The Bishops of the Province wished him to retain it altogether, and therefore were in no hurry to proceed to election.&#160; At length however they yielded to the continually expressed wishes of Gregory and chose his cousin Eulalius.&#160; Soon however Gregory&#146;s enemies spread abroad a report that this election had been made against his wishes, and with the intention of unfairly ousting him from the administration of that Church.&#160; The following letter was written in consequence of this slander.)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.ii.vii-p3"></A>Woe is me that my sojourning is prolonged, and, which is the greatest of my misfortunes, that war and dissensions are among us, and that we have not kept the peace which we received from our holy fathers.&#160; This I doubt not you will restore, in the power of the Spirit who upholds you and yours.&#160; But let no one, I beg, spread false reports about me and my lords the bishops, as though they had proclaimed another bishop in my place against my will.&#160; But being in great need, owing to my feeble health, and fearing the responsibility of a Church neglected, I asked this favour of them, which was not opposed to the Canon Law, and was a relief to me, that they would give a Pastor to the Church.&#160; He has been given to your prayers, a man worthy of your piety, and I now place him in your hands, the most reverend Eulalius, a bishop very dear to God, in whose arms I should like to die.&#160; If any be of opinion that it is not right to ordain another in the lifetime of a Bishop, let him know that he will not in this matter gain any hold upon us.&#160; For it is well known that I was appointed, not to Nazianzus, but to Sasima, although for a short time out of reverence for my father, I as a stranger undertook the government.</p>
