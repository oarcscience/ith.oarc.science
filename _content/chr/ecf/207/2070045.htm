<p class="c23"><a name="iii.ii.iii-p2"></A>There are perhaps more MSS. of the works of Gregory than of any other Father.&#160; The great Benedictine Edition of his works contains long lists of MSS., and of Versions, and previous Editions.&#160; The most famous of these is that of the Abbat Jacobus Billius in 1589, which was accompanied by the Scholia of Nicetas, etc.&#160; In 1571 Leuvenklavius published an edition at Basle containing the Scholia of Elias Cretensis and others.&#160; In 1778 appeared the first volume of the great Edition of the Benedictine Fathers of the Abbey of S. Maur near Paris, which had been in preparation ever since 1708.&#160; But the Monks were driven away by  <A NAME="page_202"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 202</FONT></A> <a name="iii.ii.iii-Page_202"></A>the French Revolution, and the second volume did not appear till 1842.&#160; It has been reprinted in Migne&#146;s &#8220;Patrologia Gr&aelig;ca,&#8221; vols. 35&#8211;38.&#160; Of modern works on the life and writings of our Saint, the best are those of Dr. Ullmann, and that of the Abb&eacute; Beno&icirc;t.&#160; A valuable comparison of Gregory and Basil is to be found in Newman&#146;s &#8220;Church of the Fathers,&#8221; and last, but not least in value, may be mentioned the long biographical article by Professor Watkins in Smith&#146;s &#8220;Dictionary of Christian Biography,&#8221; and a useful short summary in Schaff&#146;s Church History (311&#8211;600, vol. ii.).</p>
