<span id="iv.iv.vii.i"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.i-p1.1"></span>§7. To Theodore, Bishop of Tyana.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p2"></span>(Theodore, a native of Arianzus, and an
intimate friend of Gregory, accompanied him to Constantinople <span
class="sc"><span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 379, and
shared his persecution by the Arians, who broke into their church during
the celebration of the divine liturgy, and pelted the clergy with
stones.  Theodore could not bring himself to put up with this, and
declared his intention of prosecuting the aggressors.  Gregory wrote the
following letter to dissuade him from this course, by shewing him how
much more noble it is to forgive than to revenge.)

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p3"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.i-p3.1"></span>Ep. LXXVII.</span>

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p4"></span>I hear that you are indignant at the
outrages which have been committed on us by the Monks and the
Mendicants.  And it is no wonder, seeing that you never yet had felt a
blow, and were without experience of the evils we have to endure, that
you did feel angry at such a thing.  But we as experienced in many sorts
of evil, and as having had our share of insult, may be considered worthy
of belief when we exhort Your Reverence, as old age teaches and as
reason suggests.  Certainly what has happened was dreadful, and more
than dreadful,—no one will deny it:  that our altars were insulted, our
mysteries disturbed, and that we ourselves had to stand between the
communicants and those who would stone them, and to make our
intercessions a cure for stonings; that the reverence due to virgins was
forgotten, and the good order of monks, and the calamity of the poor,
who lost even their pity through ferocity.  But perhaps it would be
better to be patient, and to give an example of patience to many by our
sufferings.  For argument is not so persuasive of the world in general
as is practice, that silent exhortation.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p5"></span>We think it an important matter to
obtain penalties from those who have wronged us:  an important matter, I
say, (for even this is sometimes useful for the correction of
others)—but it is far greater and more Godlike, to bear with injuries. 
For the former course curbs wickedness, but the latter makes men good,
which is much better and more perfect than merely being not wicked.  Let
us consider that the great pursuit of mercifulness is set before us, and
let us forgive the wrongs done to us that we also may obtain
forgiveness, and let us by kindness lay up a store of kindness.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p6"></span>Phineas was called Zelotes because he
ran through the Midianitish woman with the man who was committing
fornication with her, <span id="fr_4751"></span>[4752](#fn_4751) and
because he took away the reproach from the children of Israel:  but he
was more praised because he prayed for the people when they had
transgressed. <span id="fr_4752"></span>[4753](#fn_4752)   Let us then
also stand and make propitiation, and let the plague be stayed, and let
this be counted unto us for righteousness.  Moses also was praised
because he slew the Egyptian that oppressed the Israelite; <span
id="fr_4753"></span>[4754](#fn_4753) but he was more admirable because
he healed by his prayer his sister Miriam when she was made leprous for
her murmuring. <span id="fr_4754"></span>[4755](#fn_4754)   Look also at
what follows.  The people of Nineve are threatened with an overthrow,
but by their tears they redeem their sin. <span
id="fr_4755"></span>[4756](#fn_4755)   Manasses was the most lawless of
Kings, <span id="fr_4756"></span>[4757](#fn_4756) but is the most
conspicuous among those who have attained salvation through mourning.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p13"></span>O Ephraim what shall I do unto
thee, <span id="fr_4757"></span>[4758](#fn_4757) saith God.  What anger
is here expressed—and yet protection is added.  What is swifter than
Mercy?  The Disciples ask for flames of Sodom upon those who drive Jesus
away, but He deprecates revenge. <span
id="fr_4758"></span>[4759](#fn_4758)   Peter cuts off the ear of
Malchus, one of those who outraged Him, but Jesus restores it. <span
id="fr_4759"></span>[4760](#fn_4759)   And what of him who asks whether
he must seven times forgive a brother if he has trespassed, is he not
condemned for <span id="page_472">p. 472</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vii.i-Page_472"></span>his niggardliness, for to the seven is
added seventy times seven? <span id="fr_4760"></span>[4761](#fn_4760)  
What of the debtor in the Gospel who will not forgive as he has been
forgiven? <span id="fr_4761"></span>[4762](#fn_4761)   Is it not more
bitterly exacted of him for this?  And what saith the pattern of
prayer?  Does it not desire that forgiveness may be earned by
forgiveness?

<span id="iv.iv.vii.i-p19"></span>Having so many examples let us imitate
the mercy of God, and not desire to learn from ourselves how great an
evil is requital of sin.  You see the sequence of goodness.  First it
makes laws, then it commands, threatens, reproaches, holds out warnings,
restrains, threatens again, and only when forced to do so strikes the
blow, but this little by little, opening the way to amendment.  Let us
then not strike suddenly (for it is not safe to do so), but being
self-restrained in our fear let us conquer by mercy, and make them our
debtors by our kindness, tormenting them by their conscience rather than
by anger.  Let us not dry up a fig tree which may yet bear fruit, <span
id="fr_4762"></span>[4763](#fn_4762) nor condemn it as useless and
cumbering the ground, when possibly the care and diligence of a skilful
gardener may yet heal it.  And do not let us so quickly destroy so great
and glorious a work through what is perhaps the spite and malice of the
devil; but let us choose to shew ourselves merciful rather than severe,
and lovers of the poor rather than of abstract justice; and let us not
make more account of those who would enkindle us to this than of those
who would restrain us, considering, if nothing else, the disgrace of
appearing to contend against mendicants who have this great advantage
that even if they are in the wrong they are pitied for their
misfortune.  But as things are, consider that all the poor and those who
support them, and all the Monks and Virgins are falling at your feet and
praying you on their behalf.  Grant to all these for them this favour
(since they have suffered enough as is clear by what they have asked of
us) and above all to me who am their representative.  And if it appear
to you monstrous that we should have been dishonoured by them, remember
that it is far worse that we should not be listened to by you when we
make this request of you.  May God forgive the noble Paulus his outrages
upon us.
