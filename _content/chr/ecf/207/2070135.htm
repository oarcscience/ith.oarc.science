<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.v.iii-p2"></A>(Amphilochius was acquitted of the charges made against him, referred to in former letters; but the result of the accusation on his own mind was such that he resigned his office, and retired to a sort of hermitage at a place called Ozizala, not far from Nazianzus, where he devoted his hours of labour to the cultivation of vegetables.&#160; The four letters which follow are of no special importance, and are only given as specimens of the lighter style which Gregory could use with his intimate friends.)</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="iv.iv.v.iii-p3"></A>I did not ask you for bread, just as I would not ask for water from the inhabitants of Ostracine.&#160; But if I were to ask for vegetables from a man of Ozizala it were no strange thing, nor too great a strain on friendship; for you have plenty of them, and we a great dearth.&#160; I beg you then to send me some vegetables, and plenty of them, and the best quality, or as many as you can (for even small things are great to the poor); for I am going to receive the great Basil, and you, who have had experience of him full and philosophical, would not like to know him hungry and irritated.</p>
