<span id="xi.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18 \[XI.\]—Piety is Wisdom; That is
Called the Righteousness of God, Which He Produces.</span>

<span id="xi.xxi-p2"></span>Now, this meditation makes a man godly, and
this godliness is true wisdom. By godliness I mean that which the Greeks
designate <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xxi-p2.1"></span>θεοσέβεια</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xxi-p2.2"></span>,</span>—that very virtue which is commended to
man in the passage of Job, where it is said to him, “Behold, godliness
is wisdom.” <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778) Now if the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="xi.xxi-p3.2"></span>θεοσέβεια</span> be
interpreted according to its derivation, it might be called “*the
worship of God*;” <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779) and in this
worship the essential point is, that the soul be not ungrateful to Him.
Whence it is that in the most true and excellent sacrifice we are
admonished to “give thanks unto our Lord God.” <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780) Ungrateful however, our soul would be,
were it to attribute to itself that which it received from God,
especially the righteousness, with the works of which (the especial
property, as it were, of itself, and produced, so to speak, by the soul
itself for itself) it is not puffed up in a vulgar pride, as it might be
with riches, or beauty of limb, or eloquence, or those other
accomplishments, external or internal, bodily or mental, which wicked
men too are in the habit of possessing, but, if I may say so, in a wise
complacency, as of things which constitute in an especial manner the
good works of the good. It is owing to this sin of vulgar pride that
even some great men have drifted from the sure anchorage of the divine
nature, and have floated down into the shame of idolatry. Whence the
apostle again in the same epistle, wherein he so firmly maintains the
principle of grace, after saying that he was a debtor both to the Greeks
and to the Barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise, and professing
himself ready, so far as to him pertained, to preach the gospel even to
those who lived in Rome, adds: “I am not ashamed of the Gospel of
Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the
righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The
just shall live by faith.” <span id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781) This
is the righteousness of God, which was veiled in the Old Testament, and
is revealed in the New; and it is called *the righteousness of God*,
because by His bestowal of it He makes us righteous, just as we read
that “salvation is the Lord’s,” <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782)
because He makes us safe. And this is the faith “from which” and “to
which” it is revealed,—*from the faith* of them who preach it, *to the
faith* of those who obey it. By this faith of Jesus Christ—that is, the
faith which Christ has given to us—we believe it is from God that we now
have, and shall have more and more, the ability of living righteously;
wherefore we give Him thanks with that dutiful worship with which He
only is to be worshipped.
