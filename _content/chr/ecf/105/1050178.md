id="xi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—The Examples Apposite.</span>

<span id="xi.v-p2"></span>Here, perhaps, you will say to me in answer,
that the things which I have instanced as not having been realized,
although capable of realization, are *divine* works; whereas a man’s
being without sin falls in the range of a man’s own work,—that being
indeed his very noblest work which effects a full and perfect
righteousness complete in every part; and therefore that it is
incredible that no man has ever existed, or is existing, or will exist
in this life, who has achieved such a work, if the achievement is
possible for a human being. But then you ought to reflect that, although
this great work, no doubt, belongs to human agency to accomplish, yet it
is also a divine gift, and therefore, not doubt that it is a divine
work; “for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of His
good pleasure.” <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717)
