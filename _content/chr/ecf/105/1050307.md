<span id="xii.lxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 60 \[LII.\]—Pelagius Admits “Contrary
Flesh” In the Unbaptized.</span>

<span id="xii.lxiv-p2"></span>See what obstacles he still attempts to
break through, if possible, in order to introduce his own opinion. He
raises a question for himself in these terms: “But you will tell me
that, according to the apostle, the flesh is contrary <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[1270](#fn_1269) to us;” and then answers it in this
wise: “How can it be that in the case of any baptized person the flesh
is contrary to him, when according to the same apostle he is understood
not to be in the flesh? For he says, ‘But ye are not in the
flesh.’” <span id="fr_1270"></span>[1271](#fn_1270) Very well; we shall
soon see <span id="fr_1271"></span>[1272](#fn_1271) whether it be really
true that this says that in the baptized the flesh cannot be contrary to
them; at present, however, as it was impossible for him quite to forget
that he was a Christian (although his reminiscence on the point is but
slight), he has <span id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span
id="xii.lxiv-Page_142"></span>quitted his defence of nature. Where then
is that inseparable capacity of his? Are those who are not yet baptized
not a part of human nature? Well, now, here by all means, here at this
point, he might find his opportunity of awaking out of his sleep; and he
still has it if he is careful. “How can it be,” he asks, “that in the
case of a baptized person the flesh is contrary to him?” Therefore to
the unbaptized the flesh can be contrary! Let him tell us how; for even
in these there is that nature which has been so stoutly defended by him.
However, in these he does certainly allow that nature is corrupted,
inasmuch as it was only among the baptized that the wounded traveller
left his inn sound and well, or rather remains sound in the inn whither
the compassionate Samaritan carried him that he might become
cured. <span id="fr_1272"></span>[1273](#fn_1272) Well, now, if he
allows that the flesh is contrary even in these, let him tell us what
has happened to occasion this, since the flesh and the spirit alike are
the work of one and the same Creator, and are therefore undoubtedly both
of them good, because He is good,—unless indeed it be that damage which
has been inflicted by man’s own will. And that this may be repaired in
our nature, there is need of that very Saviour from whose creative hand
nature itself proceeded. Now, if we acknowledge that this Saviour, and
that healing remedy of His by which the Word was made flesh in order to
dwell among us, are required by small and great,—by the crying infant
and the hoary-headed man alike,—then, in fact, the whole controversy of
the point between us is settled.
