<p class="c46"><a name="xviii.v.ix-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xviii.v.ix-p1.1"></A>Chapter 9.&#8212;Who are the Children of the Old Covenant.</span></p>  
<p><a name="xviii.v.ix-p2"></A>But those belong to the old testament, &#8220;which gendereth from Mount Sinai to bondage,&#8221; which is Agar, who, when they have received a law which is holy and just and good, think that the letter can suffice them for life; and do not seek the divine mercy, so as they may become doers of the law, but, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their own righteousness, are not subject to the righteousness of God. Of this kind was that multitude which murmured against God in the wilderness, and made an idol; and that multitude which even in the very land of promise committed fornication after strange gods. But this multitude, even in the old testament itself, was strongly rebuked. They, moreover, whoever they were at that time who followed after those earthly promises alone which God promises there, and who were ignorant of that which those promises signify under the new testament, and <A NAME="page_406"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 406</FONT></A> <a name="xviii.v.ix-Page_406"></A>who kept God&#146;s commandments with the desire of gaining and with the fear of losing those promises,&#8212;certainly did not observe them, but only seemed to themselves to observe. For there was no faith in them that worked by love, but earthly cupidity and carnal fear. But he who thus fulfils the commandments beyond a doubt fulfils them unwillingly, and then does not do them in his heart; for he would rather not do them at all, if in respect of those things which he desires and fears he might be allowed to neglect them with impunity. And thus, in the will itself within him, he is guilty; and it is here that God, who gives the command, looks. Such were the children of the earthly Jerusalem, concerning which the apostle says, &#8220;For she is in bondage with her children,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2716"></A><A HREF="#fn_2716"><FONT SIZE="1">2717</FONT></A>
 and belongs to the old testament &#8220;which gendereth to bondage from Mount Sinai, which is Agar.&#8221; Of that same kind were they who crucified the Lord, and continued in the same unbelief. Thence there are still their children in the great multitude of the Jews, although now the new testament as it was prophesied is made plain and confirmed by the blood of Christ; and the gospel is made known from the river where He was baptized and began His teachings, even to the ends of the earth. And these Jews, according to the prophecies which they read, are dispersed everywhere over all the earth, that even from their writings may not be wanting a testimony to Christian truth.</p>
