id="xv.iii-p7.1"></span>On the Grace of Christ.</span>

<span id="xv.iii-p8"></span>Wherein he shows that Pelagius is
disingenuous in his confession of grace, inasmuch as he places grace
either in nature and free will, or in law and teaching; and, moreover,
asserts that it is merely the “possibility” (as he calls it) of will and
action, and not the will and action itself, which is assisted by divine
grace; and that this assisting grace, too, is given by God according to
men’s merits; whilst he further thinks that they are so assisted for the
sole purpose of being able the more easily to fulfil the commandments.
Augustin examines those passages of his writings in which he boasted
that he had bestowed express commendation on the grace of God, and
points out how they can be interpreted as referring to law and
teaching,—in other words, to the divine revelation and the example of
Christ which are alike included in “the teaching,”—or else to the
remission of sins; nor do they afford any evidence whatever that
Pelagius really acknowledged Christian grace, in the sense of help
rendered for the performance of right action to natural faculty and
instruction, by the inspiration of a most glowing and luminous love; and
he concludes with a request that Pelagius would seriously listen to
Ambrose, whom he is so very fond of quoting, in his excellent eulogy in
commendation of the grace of God.
