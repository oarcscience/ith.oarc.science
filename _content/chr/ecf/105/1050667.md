<span id="xvi.vi.lxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 60.—Let Not the Pelagians Indulge
Themselves in a Cruel Defence of Infants.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.lxi-p2"></span>As I said, however, let him entertain
what views he likes of this lust; let him proclaim it as he pleases,
praise it as much as he chooses (and he pleases *much*, as several of
his extracts show), that the Pelagians may gratify themselves, if not
with its uses, at all events with its praises, as many of them as fail
to enjoy the limitation of continence enjoined in wedlock. Only let him
spare the infants, so as not to praise their condition uselessly, and
defend them cruelly. Let him not declare them to be safe; let him suffer
them to come, not, indeed, to Pelagius for eulogy, but to Christ for
salvation. For, that this book may be now brought to a termination,
since the dissertation of this man is ended, which was written on the
short paper you sent me, I will close with his last words: “Really
believe that all things were made by Jesus Christ, and that without Him
nothing was made.” <span id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335) Let him
grant that Jesus is Jesus even to infants; and as he confesses that all
things were made by Him, in that He is God the Word, so let him
acknowledge that infants, too, are saved by Him in that He is Jesus; let
him, I say, do this if he would be a catholic Christian. For thus it is
written in the Gospel: “And they shall call His name Jesus; for He shall
save His people from their sins” <span
id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336) —Jesus, because Jesus is in Latin
*Salvator*, “Saviour.” He shall, indeed, save His people; and amongst
His people surely there are infants. “From their sins” shall He save
them; in infants, too, therefore, are there original sins, on account of
which He can be Jesus, that is, Saviour, even unto them.
