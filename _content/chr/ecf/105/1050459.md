<span id="xv.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—Pelagius’ System of
Faculties.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv-p2"></span>In his system, he posits and
distinguishes three faculties, by which he says God’s commandments are
fulfilled,—*capacity*, *volition*, and *action*: <span
id="fr_1788"></span>[1789](#fn_1788) meaning by “capacity,” that by
which a man is able to be righteous; by “volition” that by which he
wills to be righteous; by “action,” that by which he actually is
righteous. The first of these, the capacity, he allows to have been
bestowed on us by the Creator of our nature; it is not in our power, and
we possess it even against our will. The other two, however, the
volition and the action, he asserts to be our own; and he assigns them
to us so strictly as to contend that they proceed simply from ourselves.
In short, according to his view, God’s grace has nothing to do with
assisting those two faculties which he will have to be altogether our
own, the volition and the action, but that only which is not in our own
power and comes to us from God, namely the capacity; as if the faculties
which are our own, that is, the volition and the action, have such avail
for declining evil and doing good, that they require no divine help,
whereas that faculty which we have of God, that is to say, the capacity,
is so weak, that it is always assisted by the aid of grace.
