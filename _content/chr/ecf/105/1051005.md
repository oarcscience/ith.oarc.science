Christ.</span>

<span id="xx.xxiv-p2"></span>Those, then, were of the multitude of the
called, but they were not of the fewness of the elected. It is not,
therefore, to His predestinated children that God has not given
perseverance for they would have it if they were in that number of
children; and what would they have which they had not received,
according to the apostolical and true judgment? <span
id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316) And thus such children would be
given to Christ the Son just as He Himself says to the Father, “That all
that Thou hast given me may not perish, but have eternal life.” <span
id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317) Those, therefore, are understood to
be given to Christ who are ordained to eternal life. These are they who
are predestinated and called according to the purpose, of whom not one
perishes. And therefore none of them ends this life when he has changed
from good to evil, because he is so ordained, and for that purpose given
to Christ, that he may not perish, but may have eternal life. And again,
those whom we call His enemies, or the infant children of His enemies,
whomever of them He will so regenerate that they may end this life in
that faith which worketh by love, are already, and before this is done,
in that predestination His children, and are given to Christ His Son,
that they may not perish, but have everlasting life.
