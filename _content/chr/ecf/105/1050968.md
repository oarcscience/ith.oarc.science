<span id="xix.iv.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34.—The Apostle’s Eulogy of Love.
Correction to Be Administered with Love.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxxiv-p2"></span>This charity, that is, this will
glowing with intensest love, the apostle eulogizes with these words:
“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or
distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the
sword? (As it is written, For Thy sake we are killed all the day long;
we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all these things
we are more than conquerors, through Him that loved us. For I am
persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which
is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” <span id="fr_3141"></span>[3142](#fn_3141)
And in another passage he says, “And yet I show unto you a more
excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and
have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And
though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and
all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove
mountains, and have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my
goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have
not love, it profiteth me nothing. Love suffereth long, and is kind;
love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not
behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,
thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things. Love never faileth.” <span
id="fr_3142"></span>[3143](#fn_3142) And a little afterwards he says,
“And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of
these is love. Follow after love.” <span
id="fr_3143"></span>[3144](#fn_3143) He also says to the Galatians,
“For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty
for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the
law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself.” <span id="fr_3144"></span>[3145](#fn_3144) This
is the same in effect as what he writes to the Romans: “He that loveth
another hath fulfilled the law.” <span
id="fr_3145"></span>[3146](#fn_3145) In like manner he says to the
Colossians, “And above all these things, put on love, which is the bond
of perfectness.” <span id="fr_3146"></span>[3147](#fn_3146) And to
Timothy he writes, “Now the end of the commandment is love;” and he goes
on to describe the quality of this grace, saying, “Out of a pure heart,
and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.” <span
id="fr_3147"></span>[3148](#fn_3147) Moreover, when he says to the
Corinthians, “Let all your things be done with love,” <span
id="fr_3148"></span>[3149](#fn_3148) he shows plainly enough that even
those chastisements which are deemed sharp and bitter by those who are
corrected thereby, are to be administered with love. Accordingly, in
another passage, after saying, “Warn them that are unruly, comfort the
feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men,” he
immediately added, “See that none render evil for evil unto any
man.” <span id="fr_3149"></span>[3150](#fn_3149) Therefore, even when
the unruly are corrected, it is not rendering evil for evil, but
contrariwise, good. However, what but love worketh all these things?
