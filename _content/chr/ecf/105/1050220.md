<span id="xi.xlvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 44.—The Answer Is, that the Passage
Must Be Understood of the Faithful of the New Covenant.</span>

<span id="xi.xlvii-p2"></span>Has the apostle perhaps mentioned those
Gentiles as having the law written in their hearts who belong to the new
testament? We must look at the previous context. First, then, referring
to the gospel, he says, “It is the power of God unto salvation to every
one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein
is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is
written, The just shall live by faith.” <span
id="fr_919"></span>[920](#fn_919) Then he goes on to speak of the
ungodly, who by reason of their pride profit not by the knowledge of
God, since they did not glorify Him as God, neither were thankful. <span
id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920) He then passes to those who think and
do the very things which they condemn,—having in view, no doubt, the
Jews, who made their boast of God’s law, but as yet not mentioning them
expressly by name; and then he says, “Indignation and wrath, tribulation
and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first,
and also of the Gentile: but glory, honour, and peace, to every soul
that doeth good; to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: for there is
no respect of persons with God. For as many as have sinned without law,
shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law,
shall be judged by the law; for not the hearers of the law are just
before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.” <span
id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921) Who they are that are treated of in
these words, he goes on to tell us: “For when the Gentiles, which have
not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law,” <span
id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922) and so forth in the passage which I
have quoted already. Evidently, therefore, no others are here signified
under the name of Gentiles than those whom he had before designated by
the name of “Greek” when he said, “To the Jew first, and also to the
Greek.” <span id="fr_923"></span>[924](#fn_923) Since then the gospel is
“the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew
first, and, also to the Greek;” <span id="fr_924"></span>[925](#fn_924)
and since “indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, are upon
every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the
Greek: but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that doeth good; to
the Jew first, and also to the Greek;” since, moreover, the Greek is
indicated by the term “Gentiles” who do by nature the things contained
in the law, and which have the work of the law written in their hearts:
it follows that such Gentiles as have the law written in their hearts
belong to the gospel, since to them, on their believing, it is the power
of God unto salvation. To what Gentiles, however, would he promise
glory, and honour, and peace, in their doing good works, if living
without the grace of the gospel? Since there is no respect of persons
with God, <span id="fr_925"></span>[926](#fn_925) and since it is not
the hearers of the law, but the doers thereof, that are justified, <span
id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926) it follows that any man of any nation,
whether Jew or Greek, who shall believe, will equally have salvation
under the gospel. “For there is no difference,” as he says afterwards;
“for all have sinned, and come short <span id="page_102">p. 102</span>
<span id="xi.xlvii-Page_102"></span>of the glory of God: being justified
freely by His grace.” <span id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927) How then
could he say that any Gentile person, who was a doer of the law, was
justified without the Saviour’s grace?
