<p><a name="xxi.iii.vii-p2"></A>What, when we say, &#8220;Thy kingdom come,&#8221; do we ask else, but that that should also come to us which we do not doubt will come to all saints? And therefore here also, what do they who are already holy pray for, save that they may persevere in that holiness which has been given them? For no otherwise will the kingdom of God come to them; which it is certain will come not to others, but to those who persevere to the end.</p>
