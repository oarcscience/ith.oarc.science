<span id="xx.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13.—Election is of Grace, Not of
Merit.</span>

<span id="xx.xvi-p2"></span>Whosoever, then, are made to differ from
that original condemnation by such bounty of divine <span
id="page_477">p. 477</span> <span id="xx.xvi-Page_477"></span>grace,
there is no doubt but that for such it is provided that they should hear
the gospel, and when they hear they believe, and in the faith which
worketh by love they persevere unto the end; and if, perchance, they
deviate from the way, when they are rebuked they are amended and some of
them, although they may not be rebuked by men, return into the path
which they had left; and some who have received grace in any age
whatever are withdrawn from the perils of this life by swiftness of
death. For He worketh all these things in them who made them vessels of
mercy, who also elected them in His Son before the foundation of the
world by the election of grace: “And if by grace, then is it no more of
works, otherwise grace is no more grace.” <span
id="fr_3290"></span>[3291](#fn_3290) For they were not so called as not
to be elected, in respect of which it is said, “For many are called but
few are elected;” <span id="fr_3291"></span>[3292](#fn_3291) but because
they were called according to the purpose, they are of a certainty also
elected by the election, as it is said, of grace, not of any precedent
merits of theirs, because to them grace is all merit.
