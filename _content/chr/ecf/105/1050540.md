<span id="xv.iv.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29.—The Righteous Men Who Lived in
the Time of the Law Were for All that Not Under the Law, But Under
Grace. The Grace of the New Testament Hidden Under the Old.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxix-p2"></span>Death indeed reigned from Adam until
Moses, <span id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964) because it was not
possible even for the law given through Moses to overcome it: it was not
given, in fact, as something able to give life; <span
id="fr_1965"></span>[1966](#fn_1965) but as something that ought to show
those that were dead and for whom grace was needed to give them life,
that they were not only prostrated under the propagation and domination
of sin, but also convicted by the additional guilt of breaking the law
itself: not in order that any one might perish who in the mercy of God
understood this even in that early age; but that, destined though he was
to punishment, owing to the dominion of death, and manifested, too, as
guilty through his own violation of the law, he might seek God’s help,
and so where sin abounded, grace might much more abound, <span
id="fr_1966"></span>[1967](#fn_1966) even the grace which alone delivers
from the body of this death. <span id="fr_1967"></span>[1968](#fn_1967)
\[XXV.\] Yet, notwithstanding this, although not even the law which
Moses gave was able to liberate any man from the dominion of death,
there were even then, too, at the time of the law, men of God who were
not living under the terror and conviction and punishment of the law,
but under the delight and healing and liberation of grace. Some there
were who said, “I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother
conceive me;” <span id="fr_1968"></span>[1969](#fn_1968) and, “There is
no rest in my bones, by reason of my sins;” <span
id="fr_1969"></span>[1970](#fn_1969) and, “Create in me a clean heart, O
God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts;” <span
id="fr_1970"></span>[1971](#fn_1970) and, “Stablish me with Thy
directing Spirit;” <span id="fr_1971"></span>[1972](#fn_1971) and, “Take
not Thy Holy Spirit from me.” <span id="fr_1972"></span>[1973](#fn_1972)
There were some, again, who said: “I believed, therefore have I
spoken.” <span id="fr_1973"></span>[1974](#fn_1973) For they too were
cleansed with the self-same faith with which we ourselves are. Whence
the apostle also says: “We having the same spirit of faith, according as
it is written, I believe, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe,
and therefore speak.” <span id="fr_1974"></span>[1975](#fn_1974) Out of
very faith was it said, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
and they shall call His name Emmanuel,” <span
id="fr_1975"></span>[1976](#fn_1975) “which is, being interpreted, God
with us.” <span id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976) Out of very faith
too was it said concerning Him: “As a bridegroom He cometh out of His
chamber; as a giant did He exult to run His course. His going forth is
from the extremity of heaven, and His circuit runs to the other end of
heaven; and no one is hidden from His heat.” <span
id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977) Out of very faith, again, was it
said to Him: “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of
righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved
righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed
Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.” <span
id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978) By the self-same Spirit of faith
were all these things foreseen by them as to happen, whereby they are
believed by us as having happened. They, indeed, who were able in
faithful love to foretell these things to us were not themselves
partakers of them. The Apostle Peter says, “Why tempt ye God to put a
yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we
were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.” <span
id="fr_1979"></span>[1980](#fn_1979) Now on what principle does he make
this statement, if it be not because even they were saved through the
grace of the Lord Jesus <span id="page_247">p. 247</span> <span
id="xv.iv.xxix-Page_247"></span>Christ, and not the law of Moses, from
which comes not the cure, but only the knowledge of sin? <span
id="fr_1980"></span>[1981](#fn_1980) Now, however, the righteousness of
God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the
prophets. <span id="fr_1981"></span>[1982](#fn_1981) If, therefore, it
is now manifested, it even then existed, but it was hidden. This
concealment was symbolized by the veil of the temple. When Christ was
dying, this veil was rent asunder, <span
id="fr_1982"></span>[1983](#fn_1982) to signify the full revelation of
Him. Even of old, therefore there existed amongst the people of God this
grace of the one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; but
like the rain in the fleece which God sets apart for His
inheritance, <span id="fr_1983"></span>[1984](#fn_1983) not of debt, but
of His own will, it was latently present, but is now patently visible
amongst all nations as its “floor,” the fleece being dry,—in other
words, the Jewish people having become reprobate. <span
