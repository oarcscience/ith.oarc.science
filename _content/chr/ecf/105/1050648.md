id="xvi.vi.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41 \[XXVI.\]—The Pelagians Argue
that Original Sin Cannot Come Through Marriage If Marriage is
Good.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xlii-p2"></span>After this he proceeds with the
following words: “Certainly if evil is contracted from marriage, it may
be blamed, nay, cannot be excused; and you place under the devil’s power
its work and fruit, because everything which is the cause of evil is
itself without good. The human being, however, who is born of wedlock
owes his origin not to the reproaches of wedlock, but to its seminal
elements: the cause of these, however, lies in the condition of bodies;
and whosoever makes a bad use of these bodies, deals a blow at the good
desert thereof, not at their nature. It is therefore clear,” argues he,
“that the good is not the cause of the evil. If, therefore,” he
continues, “original evil is derived even from marriage, the cause of
the evil is the compact of marriage; and that must needs be evil by
which and from which the evil fruit has made its appearance; even as the
Lord says in the Gospel: ‘A tree is known by its fruits.’  <span
id="fr_2281"></span>[2282](#fn_2281) How then,” he asks, “do you think
yourself worthy of attention, when you say that marriage is good, and
yet declare that nothing but evil proceeds from it? It is evident, then,
that marriages are guilty, since original sin is deduced from them; and
they are indefensible, too, unless their fruit be proved innocent. But
they are defended, and pronounced good; therefore their fruit is proved
to be innocent.”
