<p class="c46"><a name="xvi.v.xxxviii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.v.xxxviii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 38 [XXXIII.]&#8212;To Baptism Must Be Referred All Remission of Sins, and the Complete Healing of the Resurrection. Daily Cleansing.</span></p>  
<p><a name="xvi.v.xxxviii-p2"></A>Blessed, therefore, is the olive tree &#8220;whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;&#8221; blessed is it &#8220;to which the Lord hath not imputed sin.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2185"></A><A HREF="#fn_2185"><FONT SIZE="1">2186</FONT></A>
 But this, which has received the remission, the covering, and the acquittal, even up to the complete change into an eternal immortality, still retains a secret force which furnishes seed for a wild and bitter olive tree, unless the same tillage of God prunes it also, by remission, covering, and acquittal. There will, however, be left no corruption at all in even carnal seed, when the same regeneration, which <A NAME="page_279"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 279</FONT></A> <a name="xvi.v.xxxviii-Page_279"></A>is now effected through the sacred laver, purges and heals all man&#146;s evil to the very end. By its means the very same flesh, through which the carnal mind was formed, shall become spiritual,&#8212;no longer having that carnal lust which resists the law of the mind, no longer emitting carnal seed. For in this sense must be understood that which the apostle whom we have so often quoted says elsewhere: &#8220;Christ loved the Church, and gave Himself for it; that He might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of water by the word; that He might present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2186"></A><A HREF="#fn_2186"><FONT SIZE="1">2187</FONT></A>
 It must, I say, be understood as implying, that by this laver of regeneration and word of sanctification all the evils of regenerate men of whatever kind are cleansed and healed,&#8212;not the sins only which are all now remitted in baptism, but those also which after baptism are committed by human ignorance and frailty; not, indeed, that baptism is to be repeated as often as sin is repeated, but that by its one only ministration it comes to pass that pardon is secured to the faithful of all their sins both before and after their regeneration. For of what use would repentance be, either before baptism, if baptism did not follow; or after it, if it did not precede? Nay, in the Lord&#146;s Prayer itself, which is our daily cleansing, of what avail or advantage would it be for that petition to be uttered, &#8220;Forgive us our debts,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2187"></A><A HREF="#fn_2187"><FONT SIZE="1">2188</FONT></A>
 unless it be by such as have been baptized? And in like manner, how great soever be the liberality and kindness of a man&#146;s alms, what, I ask, would they profit him towards the remission of his sins if he had not been baptized? In short, on whom but on the baptized shall be bestowed the very felicities of the kingdom of heaven; where the Church shall have no spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; where there shall be nothing blameworthy, nothing unreal; where there shall be not only no guilt for sin, but no concupiscence to excite it?</p>
