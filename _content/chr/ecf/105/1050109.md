<span id="x.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Paul Worthy to Be the Prince of the
Apostles, and Yet a Sinner.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xx-p2"></span>What commendation, however, is bestowed on
Zacharias and Elisabeth which is not comprehended in what the apostle
has said about himself before he believed in Christ? He said that, “as
touching the righteousness which is in the law, he had been
blameless.” <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536) The same is said
also of them: “They were both righteous before God, walking in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.” <span
id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537) It was because whatever righteousness
they had in them was not a pretence before men that it is said
accordingly, “They walked *before the Lord*.” But that which is written
of Zacharias and his wife in the phrase, *in all the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord,* the apostle briefly expressed by the words, *in
the law.* For there was not one law for him and another for them
previous to the gospel. It was one and the same law which, as we read,
was given by Moses to their fathers, and according to which, also,
Zacharias was priest, and offered sacrifices in his course. And yet the
apostle, who was then endued with the like righteousness, goes on to
say: “But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; for whose sake I have not only
thought all things to be only detriments, but I have even counted them
as dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in Him, not having my own
righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith
of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: that I may know
Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His
suffering, being made comformable unto His death; if by any means I
might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.” <span
id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538) So far, then, is it from being true
that we should, from the words in which Scripture describes them,
suppose that Zacharias and Elisabeth had a perfect righteousness without
any sin, that we must even regard the apostle himself, according to the
selfsame rule, as not perfect, not only in that righteousness of the law
which he possessed in common with them, and which he counts as loss and
dung in comparison with that most excellent righteousness which is by
the faith of Christ, but also in the very gospel itself, wherein he
deserved the pre-eminence of his great apostleship. Now I would not
venture to say this if I did not deem it very wrong to refuse credence
to himself. He extends the passage which we have quoted, and says: “Not
as though I had already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow
after, if I may comprehend that for which also I am apprehended in
Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this
one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark, for
the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539) Here he confesses that he has not yet
attained, and is not yet perfect in that plenitude of righteousness
which he had longed to obtain in Christ; but that he was as yet pressing
towards the mark, and, forgetting what was past, was reaching out to the
things which are before him. We are sure, then, that what he says
elsewhere is true even of himself: “Al<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>
<span id="x.iv.xx-Page_53"></span>though our outward man is perishing,
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.”  <span
id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540) Although he was already a
perfect <span id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541) traveller, he had not
yet attained the perfect end of his journey. All such he would fain take
with him as companions of his course. This he expresses in the words
which follow our former quotation: “Let as many, then, of us as are
perfect, be thus minded: and if ye be yet of another mind, God will
reveal even this also to you. Nevertheless, whereunto we have already
attained, let us walk by that rule.” <span
id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542) This “walk” is not performed with the
legs of the body, but with the affections of the soul and the character
of the life, so that they who possess righteousness may arrive at
perfection, who, advancing in their renewal day by day along the
straight path of faith, have by this time become perfect as travellers
in the selfsame righteousness.
