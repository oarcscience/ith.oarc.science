<span id="xiii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>(42.) God’s Promises Conditional. Saints of
the Old Testament Were Saved by the Grace of Christ.</span>

<span id="xiii.xlvi-p2"></span>He, however, thought he had discovered a
great support for his cause in the prophet Isaiah; because by him God
said: “If ye be willing, and hearken unto me, ye shall eat the good of
the land; but if ye be not willing, and hearken not to me, the sword
shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this.” <span
id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581) As if the entire law were not full
of conditions of this sort; or as if its commandments had been given to
proud men for any other reason than that “the law was added because of
transgression, until the seed should come to whom the promise was
made.” <span id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582) “It entered,
therefore, that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded, grace
did much more abound.” <span id="fr_1583"></span>[1584](#fn_1583) In
other words, That man might receive commandments, trusting as he did in
his own resources, and that, failing in these and becoming a
transgressor, he might ask for a deliverer and a saviour; and that the
fear of the law might humble him, and bring him, as a schoolmaster, to
faith and grace. Thus “their weaknesses being multiplied, they hastened
after;” <span id="fr_1584"></span>[1585](#fn_1584) and in order to heal
them, Christ in due season came. In His grace even righteous men of old
believed, and by the same grace were they holpen; so that with joy did
they receive a foreknowledge of Him, and some of them even foretold His
coming,—whether they were found among the people of Israel themselves,
as Moses, and Joshua the son of Nun, and Samuel, and David, and other
such; or outside that people, as Job; or previous to that people, as
Abraham, and Noah, and all others who are either mentioned or not in
Holy Scripture. “For there is but one God, and one Mediator between God
and man, the man Christ Jesus,” <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1586](#fn_1585) without whose grace nobody is
delivered from condemnation, whether he has derived that condemnation
from him in whom all men sinned, or has afterwards aggravated it by his
own iniquities.
