<span id="xviii.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[X.\]—“The Law is Spiritual,
But I Am Carnal,” To Be Understood of Paul.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xvii-p2"></span>But it is not so clear how what
follows can be understood concerning Paul. “For we know,” says he, “that
the law is spiritual, but I am carnal.” <span
id="fr_2567"></span>[2568](#fn_2567) He does not say, “I was,” but, “I
am.” Was, then, the apostle, when he wrote this, carnal? or does he say
this with respect to his body? For he was still in the body of this
death, not yet made what he speaks of elsewhere: “It is sown a natural
body, it shall be raised a spiritual body.” <span
id="fr_2568"></span>[2569](#fn_2568) For then, of the whole of himself,
that is, of both parts of which he consists, he shall be a spiritual
man, when even the body shall be spiritual. For it is not absurd that in
that life even the flesh should be spiritual, if in this life in those
who still mind earthly things even the spirit itself may be carnal.
Thus, then, he said, “But I am carnal,” because the apostle had not yet
a spiritual body, as he might say, “But I am mortal,” which assuredly he
could not be understood to have said except in respect of his body,
which had not yet been clothed with immortality. Moreover, in reference
to what he added, “sold under sin,” <span
id="fr_2569"></span>[2570](#fn_2569) lest any one think that he was not
yet redeemed by the blood of Christ, this also may be understood in
respect of that which he says: “And we ourselves, having the
first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.” <span
id="fr_2570"></span>[2571](#fn_2570) For if in this respect he says that
he was sold under sin, that as yet his body has not been redeemed from
corruption; or that he was sold once in the first transgression of the
commandment so as to have a corruptible body which drags down the
soul; <span id="fr_2571"></span>[2572](#fn_2571) what hinders the
apostle here from being understood to say about himself that which he
says in such wise that it may be understood also of himself, even if in
his person he wishes not himself alone, but all, to be received who had
known themselves as struggling, without consent, in spiritual delight
with the affection of the flesh?
