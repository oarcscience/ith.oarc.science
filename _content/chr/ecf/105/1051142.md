in General.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lxii-p2"></span>Moreover, what follows where it is
said, “But yet if any of you are not yet called, whom by his grace He
has predestinated to be called, you shall receive that grace whereby you
shall will to be, and be, elected,” is said more hardly than it could be
said if we consider that we are speaking not to men in general, but to
the Church of Christ. For why is it not rather said thus: “And if any of
you are not yet called, let us pray for them that they may be called.
For perchance they are so predestinated as to be granted to our prayers,
and to receive that grace whereby they may will, and be made elected”?
For God, who fulfilled all that He predestinated, has willed us also to
pray for the enemies of the faith, that we might hence understand that
He Himself also gives to the unbelievers the gift of faith, and makes
willing men out of those that were unwilling.
