<span id="xviii.vi.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[VII.\]—Of the Praise of the
Saints.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xvii-p2"></span>In that, indeed, in the praise of the
saints, they will not drive us with the zeal of that publican <span
id="fr_2832"></span>[2833](#fn_2832) to hunger and thirst after
righteousness, but with the vanity of the Pharisees, as it were, to
overflow with sufficiency and fulness; what does it profit them that—in
opposition to the Manicheans, who do away with baptism—they say “that
men are perfectly renewed by baptism,” and apply the apostle’s testimony
for this,—“who testifies that, by the washing of water, the Church is
made holy and spotless from the Gentiles,” <span
id="fr_2833"></span>[2834](#fn_2833) —when, with a proud and perverse
meaning, they put forth their arguments in opposition to the prayers of
the Church itself. For they say this in order that the Church may be
believed after holy baptism—in which is accomplished the forgiveness of
all sins—to have no further sin; when, in opposition to them, from the
rising of the sun even to its setting, in all its members it cries to
God, “Forgive us our debts.” <span id="fr_2834"></span>[2835](#fn_2834)
But if they are interrogated regarding themselves in this matter, they
find not what to answer. For if they should say that they have no sin,
John answers them, that they deceive themselves, and the truth is not in
them. <span id="fr_2835"></span>[2836](#fn_2835) But if they confess
their sins, since they wish themselves to be members of Christ’s body,
how will that body, that is, the Church, be even in this time perfectly,
as they think, without spot or wrinkle, if its members without falsehood
confess themselves to have sins? Wherefore in baptism all sins are
forgiven, and, by that very washing of water in the word, the Church is
set forth in Christ without spot or wrinkle; <span
id="fr_2836"></span>[2837](#fn_2836) and unless it were baptized, it
would fruitlessly say, “Forgive us our debts,” until it be brought to
glory, when there is in it absolutely no spot or wrinkle. <span
id="fr_2837"></span>[2838](#fn_2837)
