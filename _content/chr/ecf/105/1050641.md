<span id="xvi.vi.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34 \[XIX.\]—The Pelagians Argue
that Cohabitation Rightly Used is a Good, and What is Born from It is
Good.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxxv-p2"></span>I request your attention now to the
following words. He says, “That children, however, who are conceived in
wedlock are by nature good, we may learn from the apostle’s words, when
he speaks of men who, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in
their lust, men with men working together that which is
disgraceful. <span id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271) Here,” says he,
“the apostle shows the use of the woman to be both natural and, in its
way, laudable; the abuse consisting in the exercise of one’s own will in
opposition to the decent use of the institution. Deservedly then,” says
he, “in those who make a right use thereof, concupiscence is commended
in its kind and mode; whilst the excess of it, in which abandoned
persons indulge, is punished. Indeed, at the very time when God punished
the abuse in Sodom with His judgment of fire, He invigorated the
generative powers of Abraham and Sarah, which had become impotent
through old age. <span id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272) If,
therefore,” he goes on to say, “you think that fault must be found with
the strength of the generative organs, because the Sodomites were
steeped in sin thereby, you will have also to censure such created
things as bread and <span id="page_297">p. 297</span> <span
id="xvi.vi.xxxv-Page_297"></span>wine, since Holy Scripture informs us
that they sinned also in the abuse of these gifts. For the Lord, by the
mouth of His prophet Ezekiel, says: ‘These, moreover, were the sins of
thy sister Sodom; in their pride, she and her children overflowed in
fulness of bread and abundance of wine; and they helped not the hand of
the poor and needy.’ <span id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273) Choose,
therefore,” says he, “which alternative you would rather have: either
impute to the work of God the sexual connection of human bodies, or
account such created things as bread and wine to be equally evil. But if
you should prefer this latter conclusion, you prove yourself to be a
Manichean. The truth, however, is this: he who observes moderation in
natural concupiscence uses a good thing well; but he who does not
observe moderation, abuses a good thing. What means your statement,
then,” <span id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274) he asks, “when you say
that ‘the good of marriage is no more impeachable on account of the
original sin which is derived herefrom, than the evil of adultery and
fornication can be excused because of the natural good which is born of
them’? In these words,” says he, “you conceded what you had denied, and
what you had conceded you nullified; and you aim at nothing so much as
to be unintelligible. Show me any bodily marriage without sexual
connection. Else impose some one name on this operation, and designate
the conjugal union as either a good or an evil. You answer, no doubt,
that you have already defined marriages to be good. Well then, if
marriage is good,—if the human being is the good fruit of marriage; if
this fruit, being God’s work, cannot be evil, born as it is by good
agency out of good,—where is the original evil which has been set aside
by so many prior admissions?”
