<span id="xviii.iii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—How Sin Died, and How It
Revived.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xvi-p2"></span>And what he says in that passage of
the Epistle to the Romans, “Sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death
to me by that which <span id="page_383">p. 383</span> <span
id="xviii.iii.xvi-Page_383"></span>is good,” <span
id="fr_2565"></span>[2566](#fn_2565) agrees with the former passages
where he said, “But I had not known sin but by the law, for I had not
known lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.” <span
id="fr_2566"></span>[2567](#fn_2566) And previously, “By the law is the
knowledge of sin,” for he said this also here, “that it might appear
sin;” that we might not understand what he had said, “For without law
sin was dead,” except in the sense as if it were not, “it lies hidden,
it does not appear, it is completely ignored, as if it were buried in I
know not what darkness of ignorance.” And in that he says, “And I was
alive once without the law,” what does he say except, I seemed to myself
to live? And with respect to what he added, “But when the commandment
came, sin revived,” what else is it but sin shone forth, became
apparent? Nor yet does he say lived, but revived. For it had lived
formerly in Paradise, where it sufficiently appeared, admitted in
opposition to the command given; but when it is inherited by children
coming into the world, it lies concealed, as if it were dead, until its
evil, resisting righteousness, is felt by its prohibition, when one
thing is commanded and approved, another thing delights and rules: then,
in some measure sin revives in the knowledge of the man that is born,
although it had lived already for some time in the knowledge of the man
as at first made.
