<span id="x.iii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40 \[XXVII.\]—A Collection of
Scripture Testimonies. From the Gospels.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xl-p2"></span>This reasoning will carry more weight,
after I have collected the mass of Scripture testimonies which I have
undertaken to adduce. We have already quoted: “I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners.” <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331) To the
same purport \[the Lord\] says, on entering the home of Zaccheus:
“To-day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son
of Abraham; for the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which
was lost.” <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332) The same truth is
declared in the parable of the lost sheep and the ninety and nine which
were left until the missing one was sought and found; <span
id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333) as it is also in the parable of the
lost one among the ten silver coins. <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334) Whence, as He said, “it behoved that
repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among
all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” <span
id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335) Mark likewise, at the end of his
Gospel, tells us how that the Lord said: “Go ye into all the world, and
preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth, and is baptized,
shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” <span
id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336) Now, who can be unaware that, in the
case of infants, being baptized is to believe, and not being baptized is
not to believe? From the Gospel of John we have already ad<span
id="page_31">p. 31</span> <span id="x.iii.xl-Page_31"></span>duced some
passages. However, I must also request your attention to the following:
John Baptist says of Christ, “Behold the Lamb of God, Behold Him which
taketh away the sin of the world;” <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337) and He too says of Himself, “My sheep
hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them
eternal life; and they shall never perish.” <span
id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338) Now, inasmuch as infants are only able
to become His sheep by baptism, it must needs come to pass that they
perish if they are not baptized, because they will not have that eternal
life which He gives to His sheep. So in another passage He says: “I am
the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by
me.” <span id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339)
