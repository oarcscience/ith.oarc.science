<span id="xx.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Whosoever Do Not Persevere are Not
Distinguished from the Mass of Perdition by Predestination.</span>

<span id="xx.xix-p2"></span>Such as these were they who were signified
to Timothy, where, when it had been said that Hymenæus and Philetus had
subverted the faith of some, it is presently added, “Nevertheless the
foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord has known
them that are His.” <span id="fr_3300"></span>[3301](#fn_3300) The faith
of these, which worketh by love, either actually does not fail at all,
or, if there are any whose faith fails, it is restored before their life
is ended, and the iniquity which had intervened is done away, and
perseverance even to the end is allotted to them. But they who are not
to persevere, and who shall so fall away from Christian faith and
conduct that the end of this life shall find them in that case, beyond
all doubt are not to be reckoned in the number of these, even in that
season wherein they are living well and piously. For they are not made
to differ from that mass of perdition by the foreknowledge and
predestination of God, and therefore are not called according to God’s
purpose, and thus are not elected; but are called among those of whom it
was said, “Many are called,” not among those of whom it was said, “But
few are elected.” And yet who can deny that they are elect, since they
believe and are baptized, and live according to God? Manifestly, they
are called elect by those who are ignorant of what they shall be, but
not by Him who knew that they would not have the perseverance which
leads the elect forward into the blessed life, and knows that they so
stand, as that He has foreknown that they will fall.
