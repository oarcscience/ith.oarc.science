id="xviii.iii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40 \[XXII.\]—The Sixth Objection,
Concerning the Necessity of Grace for All, and Concerning the Baptism of
Infants.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xl-p2"></span>They say, “We confess that the grace
of Christ is necessary to all, both to grown-up people and to infants;
and we anathematize those who say that a child born of two baptized
people ought not to be baptized.” I know in what sense you say such
things as these—not according to the Apostle Paul, but according to the
heretic Pelagius;—to wit, that baptism is necessary for infants, not for
the sake of the remission of sins, but only for the sake of the kingdom
of heaven; for you give them outside the kingdom of heaven a place of
salvation and life eternal, even if they have not been baptized. Nor do
you regard what is written, “Whosoever believeth and is baptized shall
be saved; but he who believeth not shall be condemned.” <span
id="fr_2618"></span>[2619](#fn_2618) For which reason, in the Church of
the Saviour, infants believe by means of other people, even as they have
derived those sins which are remitted them in baptism from other people.
Nor do you think thus, that they cannot have life who have been without
the body and blood of Christ, although He said Himself, “Unless ye eat
my flesh and drink my blood, ye shall have no life in you.” <span
id="fr_2619"></span>[2620](#fn_2619) Or if you are forced by the words
of the gospel to confess that infants departing from the body cannot
have either life or salvation unless they have been baptized, ask why
those who are not baptized are compelled to undergo the judgment of the
second death, by the judgment of Him who condemns nobody undeservingly,
and you will find what you do not want,—original sin!
