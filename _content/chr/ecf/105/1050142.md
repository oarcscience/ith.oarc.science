<span id="x.iv.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 53 \[XXXIII.\]—An Objection of the
Pelagians.</span>

<span id="x.iv.liii-p2"></span>But those persons who say, “If the death
of the body has happened by sin, we of course ought not to die after
that remission of sins which the Redeemer has bestowed upon us,” do not
understand how it is that some things, whose guilt God has cancelled in
order that they may not stand in our way after this life, He yet permits
to remain for the contest of faith, in order that they may become the
means of instructing and exercising those who are advancing in the <span
id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span id="x.iv.liii-Page_66"></span>struggle
after holiness. Might not some man, by not understanding this, raise a
question and ask, If God has said to man because of his sin, “In the
sweat of thy brow thou shall eat thy bread: thorns also and thistles
shall the ground bring forth to thee,” <span
id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634) how comes it to pass that this labour
and toil continues since the remission of sins, and that the ground of
believers yields them this rough and terrible harvest? Again, since it
was said to the woman in consequence of her sin, “In sorrow shall thou
bring forth children,” <span id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635) how is it
that believing women, notwithstanding the remission of their sins,
suffer the same pains in the process of parturition? And nevertheless it
is an incontestable fact, that by reason of the sin which they had
committed, the primeval man and woman heard these sentences pronounced
by God, and deserved them; nor does any one resist these words of the
sacred volume, which I have quoted about man’s labour and woman’s
travail, unless some one who is utterly hostile to the catholic faith,
and an adversary to the inspired writings.
