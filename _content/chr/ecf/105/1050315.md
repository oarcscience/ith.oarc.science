<span id="xii.lxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 68 \[LVIII.\]—Despite the Devil, Man
May, by God’s Help, Be Perfected.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxii-p2"></span>If, therefore, we feel rightly on this
matter, it is our duty at once to be thankful for what is already healed
within us, and to pray for such further healing as shall enable us to
enjoy full liberty, in that most absolute state of health which is
incapable of addition, the perfect pleasure of God. <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297) For we do not deny that human
nature can be without sin; nor ought we by any means to refuse to it the
ability to become perfect, since we admit its capacity for progress,—by
God’s grace, however, through our Lord Jesus Christ. By His assistance
we aver that it becomes holy and happy, by whom it was created in order
to be so. There is accordingly an easy refutation of the objection which
our author says is alleged by some against him: “The devil opposes us.”
This objection we also meet in entirely identical language with that
which he uses in reply: “We must resist him, and he will flee. ‘Resist
the devil,’ says the blessed apostle, ‘and he will flee from you.’ <span
id="fr_1298"></span>[1299](#fn_1298) From which it may be observed, what
his harming amounts to against those whom he flees; or what power he is
to be understood as possessing, when he prevails only against those who
do not resist him.” Such language is my own also; for it is impossible
to employ truer words. There is, however, this difference between us and
them, that we, whenever the devil has to be resisted, not only do not
deny, but actually teach, that God’s help must be sought; whereas they
attribute so much power to will as to take away prayer from religious
duty. Now it is certainly with a view to resisting the devil and his
fleeing from us that we say when we pray, “Lead us not into
temptation;” <span id="fr_1299"></span>[1300](#fn_1299) to the same end
also are we warned by our Captain, exhorting us as soldiers in the
words: “Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.” <span
