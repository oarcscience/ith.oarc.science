id="xxi.iii.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48 \[XIX.\]—Practice of Cyprian and
Ambrose.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.l-p2"></span>What, then, hinders us, when we read of
God’s foreknowledge in some commentators on God’s word, and they are
treating of the calling of the elect, from understanding the same
predestination? For they would perchance have rather used in this matter
this word which, moreover, is better understood, and which is not
inconsistent with, nay, is in accordance with, the truth which is
declared concerning the predestination of grace. This I know, that no
one has been able to dispute, except erroneously, against that
predestination which I am maintaining in accordance with the Holy
Scriptures. Yet I think that they who ask for the opinions of
commentators on this matter ought to be satisfied with men so holy and
so laudably celebrated everywhere in the faith and Christian doctrine as
Cyprian and Ambrose, of whom I have given such clear testimonies; and
that for both doctrines—that is, that they should both believe
absolutely and preach everywhere that the grace of God is gratuitous, as
we must believe and declare it to be; and that they should not think
that preaching opposed to the preaching whereby we exhort the indolent
or rebuke the evil; because these celebrated men also, although they
were preaching God’s grace in such a manner as that one of them said,
“That we must boast in nothing, because nothing is our own;” <span
id="fr_3680"></span>[3681](#fn_3680) and the other, “Our heart and our
thoughts are not in our own power;” <span
id="fr_3681"></span>[3682](#fn_3681) yet ceased not to exhort and
rebuke, in order that the divine commands might be obeyed. Neither were
they afraid of its being said to them, “Why do you exhort us, and why do
you rebuke us, if no good thing that we have is from us, and if our
hearts are not in our own power?” These holy men could by no means fear
that such things should be said to them, since they were of the mind to
understand that it is given to very few to receive the teaching of
salvation through God Himself, or through the angels of heaven, without
any human preaching to them; but that it is given to many to believe in
God through human agency. Yet, in whatever manner the word of God is
spoken to man, beyond a doubt for man to hear it in such a way as to
obey it, is God’s gift.
