<span id="xv.iii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27 \[XXVI.\]—What True Grace Is,
and Wherefore Given. Merits Do Not Precede Grace.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxvii-p2"></span>Now even Pelagius should frankly
confess that this grace is plainly set forth in the inspired Scriptures;
nor should he with shameless effrontery hide the fact that he has too
long opposed it, but admit it with salutary regret; so that the holy
Church may cease to be harassed by his stubborn persistence, and rather
rejoice in his sincere conversion. Let him distinguish between knowledge
and love, as they ought to be distinguished; because “knowledge puffeth
up, but love edifieth.” <span id="fr_1856"></span>[1857](#fn_1856) And
then knowledge no longer puffeth up when love builds up. And inasmuch as
each is the gift of God (although one is less, and the other greater),
he must not extol our righteousness above the praise which is due to Him
who justifies us, in such a way as to assign to the lesser of these two
gifts the help of divine grace, and to claim the greater one for the
human will. And should he consent that we receive love from the grace of
God, he must not suppose that any merits of our own preceded our
reception of the gift. For what merits could we possibly have had at the
time when we loved not God? In order, indeed, that we might receive that
love whereby we might love, we were loved while as yet we had no love
ourselves. This the Apostle John most expressly declares: “Not that we
loved God,” says he, “but that He loved us;” <span
id="fr_1857"></span>[1858](#fn_1857) and again, “We love Him, because He
first loved us.” <span id="fr_1858"></span>[1859](#fn_1858) Most
excellently and truly spoken! For we could not have wherewithal to love
Him, unless we received it from Him in His first loving us. <span
id="page_227">p. 227</span> <span id="xv.iii.xxvii-Page_227"></span>And
what good could we possibly do if we possessed no love? Or how could we
help doing good if we have love? For although God’s commandment appears
sometimes to be kept by those who do not love Him, but only fear Him;
yet where there is no love, no good work is imputed, nor is there any
good work, rightly so called; because “whatsoever is not of faith is
sin,” <span id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859) and “faith worketh by
love.” <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860) Hence also that grace
of God, whereby “His love is shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy
Ghost, which is given unto us,” <span
id="fr_1861"></span>[1862](#fn_1861) must be so confessed by the man who
would make a true confession, as to show his undoubting belief that
nothing whatever in the way of goodness pertaining to godliness and real
holiness can be accomplished without it. Not after the fashion of him
who clearly enough shows us what he thinks of it when he says, that
“grace is bestowed in order that what God commands may be the more
easily fulfilled;” which of course means, that even without grace God’s
commandments may, although less easily, yet actually, be accomplished.
