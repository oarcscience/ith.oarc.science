<span id="xxi.iii.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 55.—Testimony of His Previous
Writings and Letters.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lvii-p2"></span>And, indeed, in that treatise of which
the title is, *Of Rebuke and Grace*, <span
id="fr_3692"></span>[3693](#fn_3692) which could not suffice for all my
lovers, I think that I have so established that it is the gift of God
also to persevere to the end, as I have either never before or almost
never so expressly and evidently maintained this in writing, unless my
memory deceives me. But I have now said this in a way in which no one
before me has said it. Certainly the blessed Cyprian, in the Lord’s
Prayer, as I have already shown, so explained our petitions as to say
that in its very first petition we were asking for perseverance,
asserting that we pray for it when we say, “Hallowed be Thy name,” <span
id="fr_3693"></span>[3694](#fn_3693) although we have been already
hallowed in baptism,—so that we may persevere in that which we have
begun to be. Let those, however, to whom, in their love for me, I ought
not to be ungrateful, who profess that they embrace, over and above that
which comes into the argument, all my views, as you write,—let those, I
say, see whether, in the latter portions of the first book of those two
which I wrote in the beginning of my episcopate, before the appearance
of the Pelagian heresy, to Simplicianus, the bishop of Milan, <span
id="fr_3694"></span>[3695](#fn_3694) there remained anything whereby it
might be called in question that God’s grace is not given according to
our merits; and whether I have not there sufficiently argued that even
the beginning of faith is God’s gift; and whether from what is there
said it does not by consequence result, although it is not expressed,
that even perseverance to the end is not given, except by Him who has
predestinated us to His kingdom and glory. Then, did not I many years
ago publish that letter which I had already written to the holy
Paulinus, <span id="fr_3695"></span>[3696](#fn_3695) bishop of Nola,
against the Pelagians, which they have lately begun to contradict? Let
them also look into that letter which I sent to Sixtus, the presbyter of
the Roman Church <span id="fr_3696"></span>[3697](#fn_3696) when we
contended in a very sharp conflict against the Pelagians, and they will
find it such as is that one to Paulinus. Whence they may gather that the
same sort of things were already said and written several years ago
against the Pelagian heresy, and that it is to be wondered at that these
should now displease them; although I should wish that no one would so
embrace all my views as to follow me, except in those things in which he
should see me not to have erred. For I am now writing treatises in which
I have undertaken to retract my smaller works, for the purpose of
demonstrating that even I myself have not in all things followed myself;
but I think that, with God’s mercy, I have written progressively, and
not begun from perfection; since, indeed, I speak more arrogantly than
truly, if even now I say that I have at length in this age of mine
arrived at perfection, without any error in what I write. But the
difference is in the extent and the subject of an error, and in the
facility with which any one corrects it, or the pertinacity with which
one endeavours to defend his error. Certainly there is good hope of that
man whom the last day of this life shall find so progressing that
whatever was wanting to his progress may be added to him, and that he
should be adjudged rather to need perfecting than punishment.
