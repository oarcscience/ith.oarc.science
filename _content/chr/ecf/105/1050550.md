<span id="xv.iv.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39 \[XXXIV.\]—Three Things Good and
Laudable in Matrimony.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxxix-p2"></span>Marriage, therefore, is a good in all
the things which are proper to the married state. And these are three:
it is the ordained means of procreation, it is the guarantee <span
id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016) of chastity, it is the bond of
union. <span id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017) In respect of its
ordination for generation the Scripture says, “I will therefore that the
younger women marry, bear children, guide the house;” <span
id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018) as regards its guaranteeing
chastity, it is said of it, “The wife hath not power of her own body,
but the husband; and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own
body, but the wife;” <span id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019) and
considered as the bond of union: “What God hath joined together, let not
man put asunder.” <span id="fr_2020"></span>[2021](#fn_2020) Touching
these points, we do not forget that we have treated at sufficient
length, with whatever ability the Lord has given us, in other works of
ours, which are not unknown to you. <span
id="fr_2021"></span>[2022](#fn_2021) In relation to them all the
Scripture has this general praise: “Marriage is honourable in all, and
the bed undefiled.” <span id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022) For,
inasmuch as the wedded state is good, insomuch does it produce a very
large amount of good in respect of the evil of concupiscence; for it is
not lust, but reason, which makes a good use of concupiscence. Now lust
lies in that law of the “disobedient” members which the apostle notes as
“warring against the law of the mind;” <span
id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023) whereas reason lies in that law of
the wedded state which makes good use of concupiscence. If, however, it
were impossible for any good to arise out of evil, God could not create
man out of the embraces of adultery. As, therefore, the damnable evil of
adultery, whenever man is born in it, is not chargeable on God, who
certainly amidst man’s evil work actually produces a good work; so,
likewise, all which causes shame in that rebellion of the members which
brought the accusing blush on those who after their sin covered these
members with the fig-tree leaves, <span
id="fr_2024"></span>[2025](#fn_2024) is not laid to the charge of
marriage, by virtue of which the conjugal embrace is not only allowable,
but is even useful and honourable; but it is imputable to the sin of
that disobedience which was followed by the penalty of man’s finding his
own members emulating against himself that very disobedience which he
had practised against God. Then, abashed at their action, since they
moved no more at the bidding of his rational will, but at their own
arbitrary choice as it were, instigated by lust, he devised the covering
which should conceal such of them as he judged to be worthy of shame.
For man, as the handiwork of God, deserved not confusion of face; nor
were the members which it seemed fit to the Creator to form and appoint
by any means designed to bring the blush to the creature. Accordingly,
that simple nudity was displeasing neither to God nor to man: there was
nothing to be ashamed of, because nothing at first accrued which
deserved punishment.
