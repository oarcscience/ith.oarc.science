Presbyter Peter.</span>

<span id="xvii.v-p3"></span>He advises Peter not to incur the imputation
of having approved of the books which had been addressed to him by
Victor on the origin of the soul, by any use he might make of them, nor
to take as Catholic doctrines that person’s rash utterances contrary to
the Christian faith. Victor’s various errors, and those, too, of a very
serious character, he points out and briefly confutes; and he concludes
with advising Peter himself to try to persuade Victor to amend his
errors.

<span id="xvii.v-p4"></span>To his Lordship, my dearly beloved brother
and fellow-presbyter Peter, Augustin, bishop, sendeth greeting in the
Lord.
