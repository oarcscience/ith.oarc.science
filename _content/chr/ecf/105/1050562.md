<span id="xvi.ii-p6"></span>“<span class="c16"><span
id="xvi.ii-p6.1"></span>I Addressed</span> two books to the Illustrious
Count Valerius, upon hearing that the Pelagians had brought sundry vague
charges upon us—how, for instance, we condemned marriage by maintaining
Original Sin. These books are entitled, *On Marriage and Concupiscence*.
We maintain that marriage is good; and that it must not be supposed that
the concupisence of the flesh, or “the law in our members which wars
against the law of mind,”  <span id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048) is
a fault of marriage. Conjugal chastity makes a good use of the evil of
concupiscence in the procreation of children. My first treatise
contained two books. The first of them found its way into the hands of
Julianus the Pelagian, who wrote four books in opposition to it. Out of
these, somebody extracted sundry passages, and sent them to Count
Valerius; he handed them to us, and after I had received them I wrote a
second book in answer to these extracts. The first book of this work of
mine opens with these words: “Our new heretics, most beloved son
Valerius,” while the second begins thus: “Amid the cares of your duty as
a soldier.”
