<p><a name="xv.iii.li-p2"></A>Let him lend an ear also to the same godly bishop, who says, in the sixth book of this same book:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1907"></A><A HREF="#fn_1907"><FONT SIZE="1">1908</FONT></A>
 &#8220;The reason why they would not receive Him is mentioned by the evangelist himself in these words, &#145;Because His face was as though He would go to Jerusalem.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1908"></A><A HREF="#fn_1908"><FONT SIZE="1">1909</FONT></A>
 But His disciples had a strong wish that He should be received into the Samaritan town. God, however, calls whomsoever He deigns, and whom He wills He makes religious.&#8221; What wise insight of the man of God, drawn from the very fountain of God&#146;s grace! &#8220;God,&#8221; says he, &#8220;calls whomsoever He deigns, and whom He wills He makes religious.&#8221; See whether this is not the prophet&#146;s own declaration: &#8220;I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will show pity on whom I will be pitiful;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1909"></A><A HREF="#fn_1909"><FONT SIZE="1">1910</FONT></A>
 and the apostle&#146;s deduction therefrom: &#8220;So then,&#8221; says he, &#8220;it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1910"></A><A HREF="#fn_1910"><FONT SIZE="1">1911</FONT></A>
 Now, when even his model man of our own times says, that &#8220;whomsoever God deigns He calls, and whom He wills He makes religious,&#8221; will any one be bold enough to contend that that man is not yet religious &#8220;who hastens to the Lord, and desires to be directed by Him, and makes his own will depend upon God&#146;s; who, moreover, cleaves so closely to the Lord, that he becomes (as the apostle says) &#145;one spirit&#146; with Him?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1911"></A><A HREF="#fn_1911"><FONT SIZE="1">1912</FONT></A>
 Great, however, as is this entire work of a &#8220;religious man,&#8221; Pelagius maintains that &#8220;it is effected only by the freedom of the will.&#8221; But his own blessed Ambrose, whom he so highly commends in word, is against him, saying, &#8220;The Lord God calls whomsoever He deigns, and whom He wills He makes religious.&#8221; It is God, then, who makes religious whomsoever He pleases, in order that he may &#8220;hasten to the Lord, and desire to be directed by Him, and make his own will depend upon God&#146;s, and cleave so closely to the Lord as to become (as the apostle says) &#145;one spirit&#146; with Him;&#8221; and all this none but a religious man does. Who, then, ever does so much, unless he be made by God to do it?</p>
