<span id="xviii.vi.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—Further References to
Cyprian.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xxiii-p2"></span>And in the epistle which he wrote
with sixty-six of his joint-bishops to Bishop Fidus, when he was
consulted by him in respect of the law of circumcision, whether an
infant might be baptized before the eighth day, this matter is treated
in such a way as if by a divine forethought the catholic Church would
already confute the Pelagian heretics who would appear so long
afterwards. For he who had consulted had no doubt on the subject whether
children on birth inherited original sin, which they might wash away by
being born again. For be it far from the Christian faith to have at any
time doubted on this matter. But he was in doubt whether the washing of
regeneration, by which he made no question but that original sin was put
away, ought to be given before the eighth day. To which consultation the
most blessed Cyprian in reply said: “But as regards the case of infants,
which you say ought not to be baptized within the second or third day
after their birth, and that the law of the ancient circumcision should
be regarded, so that you think that one who is born should not be
baptized and sanctified within the eighth day, we all thought very
differently in our council. For to the course which you thought was to
be taken no one agreed, but we all rather judged that the grace of a
merciful God was not to be denied to any one born of men; for, as the
Lord says in His gospel, ‘the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s
lives, but to save them.’  <span id="fr_2846"></span>[2847](#fn_2846) As
far as we can, we must strive that, if possible, no soul be lost.” <span
id="fr_2847"></span>[2848](#fn_2847) And a little afterwards he says:
“Nor ought any of us to shudder at what God hath condescended to make.
For although the infant is still fresh from its birth, yet it is not
such that any one should shudder at kissing it in giving grace and in
making peace, since in the kiss of an infant every one of us ought for
his very religion’s sake to consider the still recent hands of God
themselves, which in some sort we are kissing in the man just formed and
newly born, when we are embracing that which God has made.” <span
id="fr_2848"></span>[2849](#fn_2848) A little after, also, he says: “But
if anything could hinder men from obtaining grace, their more heinous
sins might rather hinder those who are mature and grown up and older.
But again, if even to the greatest sinners, and to those who have before
sinned much against God, when they have subsequently believed, remission
of sins is granted, and nobody is hindered from baptism and from grace;
how much rather ought we to shrink from hindering an infant, who, being
lately born, has not sinned, except that, being born after the flesh
according to Adam, he has contracted the contagion of the ancient death
at his earliest birth; who approaches more easily on this very account
to <span id="page_427">p. 427</span> <span
id="xviii.vi.xxiii-Page_427"></span>the reception of the forgiveness of
sins, in that to him are remitted not his own sins, but the sins of
another!” <span id="fr_2849"></span>[2850](#fn_2849)
