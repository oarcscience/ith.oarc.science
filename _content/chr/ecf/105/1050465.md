<span id="xv.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 \[IX.\]—What Purpose the Law
Subserves.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.x-p2"></span>What object, then, can this man gain by
accounting the law and the teaching to be the grace whereby we are
helped to work righteousness? For, in order that it may help much, it
must help us to feel our need of grace. No man, indeed, is able to
fulfil the law through the law. “Love is the fulfilling of the
law.” <span id="fr_1800"></span>[1801](#fn_1800) And the love of God is
not shed abroad in our hearts by the law, but by the Holy Ghost, which
is given unto us. <span id="fr_1801"></span>[1802](#fn_1801) Grace,
therefore, is pointed at by the law, in order that the law may be
fulfilled by grace. Now what does it avail for Pelagius, that he
declares the self-same thing under different phrases, that he may not be
understood to place in law and teaching that grace which, as he avers,
assists the “capacity” of our nature? So far, indeed, as I can
conjecture, the reason why he fears being so understood is, because he
condemned all those who maintain that God’s grace and help are not given
for a man’s single actions, but exist rather in his freedom, or in the
law and teaching. And yet he supposes that he escapes detection by the
shifts he so constantly employs for disguising what he means by his
formula of “law and teaching” under so many various phrases.
