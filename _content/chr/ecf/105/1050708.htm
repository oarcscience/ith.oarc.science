<p class="c49"><a name="xvii.v-p3"></A>He advises Peter not to incur the imputation of having approved of the books which had been addressed to him by Victor on the origin of the soul, by any use he might make of them, nor to take as Catholic doctrines that person&#146;s rash utterances contrary to the Christian faith. Victor&#146;s various errors, and those, too, of a very serious character, he points out and briefly confutes; and he concludes with advising Peter himself to try to persuade Victor to amend his errors.</p>   
<p class="c27"><a name="xvii.v-p4"></A>To his Lordship, my dearly beloved brother and fellow-presbyter Peter, Augustin, bishop, sendeth greeting in the Lord.</p>
