<span id="xvi.v.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28 \[XXV.\]—Concupiscence Remains
After Baptism, Just as Languor Does After Recovery from Disease;
Concupiscence is Diminished in Persons of Advancing Years, and Increased
in the Incontinent.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxviii-p2"></span>If the question arises, how this
concupiscence of the flesh remains in the regenerate, in whose case has
been effected a remission of all sins whatever; seeing that human
semination takes place by its means, even when the carnal offspring of
even a baptized parent is born: or, at all events, if it may be in the
case of a baptized parent concupiscence and not be sin, why should this
same concupiscence be sin in the offspring?—the answer to be given is
this: Carnal concupiscence is remitted, indeed, in baptism; not so that
it is put out of existence, but so that it is not to be imputed for sin.
Although its guilt is now taken away, it still remains until our entire
infirmity be healed by the advancing renewal of our inner man, day by
day, when at last our outward man shall be clothed with
incorruption. <span id="fr_2151"></span>[2152](#fn_2151) It does not
remain, however, substantially, as a body, or a spirit; but it is
nothing more than a certain affection of an evil quality, such as
languor, for instance. There is not, to be sure, anything remaining
which may be remitted whenever, as the Scripture says, “the Lord
forgiveth all our iniquities.” <span
id="fr_2152"></span>[2153](#fn_2152) But until that happens which
immediately follows in the same passage, “Who healeth all thine
infirmities, who redeemeth thy life from corruption,” <span
id="fr_2153"></span>[2154](#fn_2153) there remains this concupiscence of
the flesh in the body of this death. Now we are admonished not to obey
its sinful desires to do evil: “Let not sin reign in your mortal
body.” <span id="fr_2154"></span>[2155](#fn_2154) Still this
concupiscence is daily lessened in persons of continence and increasing
years, and most of all when old age makes a near approach. The man,
however, who yields to it a wicked service, receives such great energies
that, even when all his members are now failing through age, and those
especial parts of his body are unable to be applied to their proper
function, he does not ever cease to revel in a still increasing rage of
disgraceful and shameless desire.
