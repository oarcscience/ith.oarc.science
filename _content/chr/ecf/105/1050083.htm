<p><a name="x.iii.lxv-p2"></A>Will this also be questioned, and must we spend time in discussing it, in order to prove and show how that by their own will&#8212;without which there can be no sin in their own life&#8212;infants could never commit an offence, whom all, for this very reason, are in the habit of calling <i>innocent?</i> Does not their great weakness of mind and body, their great ignorance of things, their utter inability to obey a precept, the absence in them of all perception and impression of law, either natural or written, the complete want of reason to impel them in either direction,&#8212;proclaim and demonstrate the point before us by a silent testimony far more expressive than any argument of ours? The very palpableness of the fact must surely go a great way to persuade us of its truth; for there is no place where I do not find traces of what I say, so ubiquitous is the fact of which we are speaking,&#8212;clearer, indeed, to perceive than any thing we can say to prove it.</p>
