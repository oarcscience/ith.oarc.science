<span id="xix.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 \[V.\]—Free Will and God’s Grace
are Simultaneously Commended.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.x-p2"></span>When God says, “Turn ye unto me, and I
will turn unto you,” <span id="fr_3010"></span>[3011](#fn_3010) one of
these clauses—that which invites our return to God—evidently belongs to
our will; while the other, which promises His return to us, belongs to
His grace. Here, possibly, the Pelagians think they have a justification
for their opinion which they so prominently advance, that God’s grace is
given according to our merits. In the East, indeed, that is to say, in
the province of Palestine, in which is the city of Jerusalem, Pelagius,
when examined in person by the bishop,  <span
id="fr_3011"></span>[3012](#fn_3011) did not venture to affirm this. For
it happened that among the objections which were brought up against him,
this in particular was objected, that he maintained that the grace of
God was given according to our merits,—an opinion which was so diverse
from catholic doctrine, and so hostile to the grace of Christ, that
unless he had anathematized it, as laid to his charge, he himself must
have been anathematized on its account. He pronounced, indeed, the
required anathema upon the dogma, but how insincerely his later books
plainly show; for in them he maintains absolutely no other opinion than
that the grace of God is given according to our merits. Such passages do
they collect out of the Scriptures,—like the one which I just now
quoted, “Turn ye unto me, and I will turn unto you,”—as if it were owing
to the merit of our turning to God that His grace were given us, wherein
He Himself even turns unto us. Now the persons who hold this opinion
fail to observe that, unless our turning to God were itself God’s gift,
it would not be said to Him in prayer, “Turn us again, O God of
hosts;” <span id="fr_3012"></span>[3013](#fn_3012) and, “Thou, O God,
wilt turn and quicken us;” <span id="fr_3013"></span>[3014](#fn_3013)
and again, “Turn us, O God of our salvation,” <span
id="fr_3014"></span>[3015](#fn_3014) —with other passages of similar
import, too numerous to mention here. For, with respect to our coming
unto Christ, what else does it mean than our being turned to Him by
believing? And yet He says: “No man can come unto me, except it were
given unto him of my Father.” <span id="fr_3015"></span>[3016](#fn_3015)
