<span id="xxi.iii.li-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49.—Further References to Cyprian
and Ambrose.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.li-p2"></span>Wherefore, the above-mentioned most
excellent commentators on the divine declarations both preached the true
grace of God as it ought to be preached,—that is, as a grace preceded by
no human deservings,—and urgently exhorted to the doing of the divine
commandments, that they who might have the gift of obedience should hear
what commands they ought to obey. For if any merits of ours precede
grace, certainly it is the merit of some deed, or word, or thought,
wherein also is understood a good will itself. But he very briefly
summed up the kinds of all deservings who said, “We must glory in
nothing, because nothing is our own.” And he who says, “Our heart and
our <span id="page_546">p. 546</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.li-Page_546"></span>thoughts are not in our own power,” did
not pass over acts and words also, for there is no act or word of man
which does not proceed from the heart and the thought. But what more
could that most glorious martyr and most luminous doctor Cyprian say
concerning this matter, than when he impressed upon us that it behoves
us to pray, in the Lord’s Prayer, even for the adversaries of the
Christian faith, showing what he thought of the beginning of the faith,
that it also is God’s gift, and pointing out that the Church of Christ
prays daily for perseverance unto the end, because none but God gives
that perseverance to those who have persevered? Moreover, the blessed
Ambrose, when he was expounding the passage where the Evangelist Luke
says, “It seemed good to me also,”  <span
id="fr_3682"></span>[3683](#fn_3682) says, “What he declares to have
seemed good to himself cannot have seemed good to him alone. For not
alone by human will did it seem good, but as it pleased Him who speaks
in me, Christ, who effects that that which is good may also seem good to
us: for whom He has mercy on He also calls. And therefore he who follows
Christ may answer, when he is asked why he wished to become a Christian,
‘It seemed good to me also.’ And when he says this, he does not deny
that it seemed good to God; for the will of men is prepared by God. For
it is God’s grace that God should be honoured by the saint.” <span
id="fr_3683"></span>[3684](#fn_3683) Moreover, in the same work,—that
is, in the exposition of the same Gospel, when he had come to that place
where the Samaritans would not receive the Lord when His face was as
going to Jerusalem,—he says, “Learn at the same time that He would not
be received by those who were not converted in simpleness of mind. For
if He had been willing, He would have made them devout who were
undevout. And why they would not receive Him, the evangelist himself
mentioned, saying, ‘Because His face was as of one going towards
Jerusalem.’ <span id="fr_3684"></span>[3685](#fn_3684) But the disciples
earnestly desired to be received into Samaria. But God calls those whom
He makes worthy, and makes religious whom He will.” <span
id="fr_3685"></span>[3686](#fn_3685) What more evident, what more
manifest do we ask from commentators on God’s word, if we are pleased to
hear from them what is clear in the Scriptures? But to these two, who
ought to be enough, let us add also a third, the holy Gregory, who
testifies that it is the gift of God both to believe in God and to
confess what we believe, saying, “I beg of you confess the Trinity of
one godhead; but if ye wish otherwise, say that it is of one nature, and
God will be besought that a voice shall be given to you by the Holy
Spirit;” that is, God will be besought to allow a voice to be given to
you by which you may confess what you believe. “For He will give, I am
certain. He who gave what is first, will give also what is
second.” <span id="fr_3686"></span>[3687](#fn_3686) He who gave belief,
will also give confession.
