But He Needs Grace for His Cure.</span>

<span id="xii.xxxviii-p2"></span>Well, but what does he mean when he
says: “Then again, how can one be subjected to God for the guilt of that
sin, which he knows is not his own? For,” says he, “his own it is not,
if it is necessary. Or, if it is his own, it is voluntary: and if it is
voluntary, it can be avoided.” We reply: It is unquestionably his own.
But the fault by which sin is committed is not yet in every respect
healed, and the fact of its becoming permanently fixed in us arises from
our not rightly using the healing virtue; and so out of this faulty
condition the man who is now grow<span id="page_133">p. 133</span> <span

sins, either through infirmity or blindness. Prayer must therefore be
made for him, that he may be healed, and that he may thenceforward
attain to a life of uninterrupted soundness of health; nor must pride be
indulged in, as if any man were healed by the self-same power whereby he
became corrupted.
