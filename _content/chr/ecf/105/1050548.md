<span id="xv.iv.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37 \[XXXII.\]—In What Sense Christ
is Called “Sin.”</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxxvii-p2"></span>There was a change of the sacramental
ordinances made after the coming of Him whose advent they prefigured;
but there was no change in the Mediator’s help, who, even previous to
His coming in the flesh, all along delivered the ancient members of His
body by their faith in His incarnation; and in respect of ourselves too,
though we were dead in sins and in the uncircumcision of our flesh, we
are quickened together in Christ, in whom we are circumcised with the
circumcision not made with the hand, <span
id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009) but such as was prefigured by the
old manual circumcision, that the body of sin might be done away <span
id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010) which was born with us from Adam.
The propagation of a condemned origin condemns us, unless we are
cleansed by the likeness of sinful flesh, in which He was sent without
sin, who nevertheless concerning sin condemned sin, having been made sin
for us. <span id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011) Accordingly the
apostle says: “We beseech you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled unto
God. For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
might be made the righteousness of God in Him.” <span
id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012) God, therefore, to whom we are
reconciled, has made Him to be sin for us,—that is to say, a sacrifice
by which our sins may be remitted; for by sins are designated the
sacrifices for sins. And indeed He was sacrificed for our sins, the only
one among men who had no sins, even as in those early times one was
sought for among the flocks to prefigure the Faultless One who was to
come to heal our offences. On whatever day, therefore, an infant may be
baptized after his birth, he is as if circumcised on the eighth day;
inasmuch as he is circumcised in Him who rose again the third day indeed
after He was crucified, but the eighth according to the weeks. He is
circumcised for the putting off of the body of sin; in other words, that
the grace of spiritual regeneration may do away with the debt which the
contagion of carnal generation contracted. “For no one is pure from
uncleanness” (what uncleanness, pray, but that of sin?), “not even the
infant, whose life is but that of a single day upon the earth.” <span
