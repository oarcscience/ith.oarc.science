<span id="xviii.vi.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29 \[XI.\]—The Testimonies of
Ambrose Against the Pelagians and First of All Concerning Original
Sin.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xxix-p2"></span>But now also to the most glorious
martyr Cyprian, let me add, for the sake of more amply confuting these
men, the most blessed Ambrose; because even Pelagius praised him so much
as to say that in his writings could be found nothing to be blamed even
by his enemies. <span id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882) Since, then,
the Pelagians say that there is no original sin with which infants are
born, and object to the catholics the guilt of the Manichean heresy, who
withstand them on behalf of the most ancient faith of the Church, let
this catholic man of God, Ambrose, praised even by Pelagius himself in
the truth of the faith, answer them concerning this matter. When he was
expounding the prophet Isaiah, he says: “Christ was, therefore, without
spot, because He was not stained even in the usual condition itself of
birth.” <span id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883) And in another place
in the same work, speaking of the Apostle Peter, he says: “He offered
himself, which he thought before to be sin, asking for himself that not
only his feet but his head also should be washed, because he had
directly understood that by the washing of the feet, for those who fell
in the first man, the filth of the obnoxious succession was
abolished.” <span id="fr_2884"></span>[2885](#fn_2884) Also in the same
work he says: “It was preserved, therefore, that of a man and woman,
that is, by that mingling of bodies, no one could be seen to be free
from sin; but He who is free from sin is free also from this kind of
conception.” Also writing against the Novatians he says: “All of us men
are born under sin. And our very origin is in corruption, as you have it
read in the words of David, <span id="fr_2885"></span>[2886](#fn_2885)
‘For lo, I was conceived in iniquities; and in sins hath my mother
brought me forth.’” <span id="fr_2886"></span>[2887](#fn_2886) Also in
the apology of the prophet David, he says: “Before we are born we are
spotted with contagion, and before the use of light we receive the
mischief of that origin. We are conceived in iniquity.” <span
id="fr_2887"></span>[2888](#fn_2887) Also speaking of the Lord, he says:
“It was certainly fitting that He who was not to have the sin of a
bodily fall, should feel no natural contagion of generation. Rightly,
therefore, David with weeping deplored in himself these defilements of
nature, and the fact that the stain had begun in man before his
life.” <span id="fr_2888"></span>[2889](#fn_2888) Again, in the Ark of
Noah he says: “Therefore by one Lord Jesus the coming salvation is
declared to the nations; for He only could be righteous, although every
generation should go astray, nor for any other reason than that, being
born of a virgin, He was not at all bound by the ordinance of a guilty
generation. ‘Behold,’ he says, ‘I was conceived in iniquities; and in
sins has my mother brought me forth;’ <span
id="fr_2889"></span>[2890](#fn_2889) he who was esteemed righteous
beyond others so speaks. Whom, then, should I now call righteous unless
Him who is free from those chains, whom the bonds of our common nature
do not hold fast?” <span id="fr_2890"></span>[2891](#fn_2890) Behold,
this holy man, most approved, even by the witness of Pelagius, in the
catholic faith, condemned the Pelagians who deny original sin with such
evidence as this; and yet he does not with the Manicheans deny either
God to be the Creator of those who are born, or condemn marriage, which
God ordained and blessed.
