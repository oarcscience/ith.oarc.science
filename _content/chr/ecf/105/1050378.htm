<p class="c46"><a name="xiii.xlvi-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xiii.xlvi-p1.1"></A>(42.) God&#146;s Promises Conditional. Saints of the Old Testament Were Saved by the Grace of Christ.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xiii.xlvi-p2"></A>He, however, thought he had discovered a great support for his cause in the prophet Isaiah; because by him God said: &#8220;If ye be willing, and hearken unto me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye be not willing, and hearken not to me, the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1581"></A><A HREF="#fn_1581"><FONT SIZE="1">1582</FONT></A>
 As if the entire law were not full of conditions of this sort; or as if its commandments had been given to proud men for any other reason than that &#8220;the law was added because of transgression, until the seed should come to whom the promise was made.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1582"></A><A HREF="#fn_1582"><FONT SIZE="1">1583</FONT></A>
 &#8220;It entered, therefore, that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1583"></A><A HREF="#fn_1583"><FONT SIZE="1">1584</FONT></A>
 In other words, That man might receive commandments, trusting as he did in his own resources, and that, failing in these and becoming a transgressor, he might ask for a deliverer and a saviour; and that the fear of the law might humble him, and bring him, as a schoolmaster, to faith and grace. Thus &#8220;their weaknesses being multiplied, they hastened after;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1584"></A><A HREF="#fn_1584"><FONT SIZE="1">1585</FONT></A>
 and in order to heal them, Christ in due season came. In His grace even righteous men of old believed, and by the same grace were they holpen; so that with joy did they receive a foreknowledge of Him, and some of them even foretold His coming,&#8212;whether they were found among the people of Israel themselves, as Moses, and Joshua the son of Nun, and Samuel, and David, and other such; or outside that people, as Job; or previous to that people, as Abraham, and Noah, and all others who are either mentioned or not in Holy Scripture. &#8220;For there is but one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1585"></A><A HREF="#fn_1585"><FONT SIZE="1">1586</FONT></A>
 without whose grace nobody is delivered from condemnation, whether he has derived that condemnation from him in whom all men sinned, or has afterwards aggravated it by his own iniquities.</p>
