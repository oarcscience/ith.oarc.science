<span id="xviii.iii.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37 \[XIX.\]—The Beginning of a
Good Will is the Gift of Grace.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxxvii-p2"></span>But you think that a man is so
aided by the grace of God in a good work, that in stirring up his will
to that very good work you believe that grace does nothing; for this
your own words sufficiently declare. For why have you not said that a
man is incited by God’s grace to a good work, as you have said that he
is incited to evil by the suggestions of the devil, but have said that
in a good work he is always aided by God’s grace?—as if by his own will,
and without any grace of God, he undertook a good work, and were then
divinely assisted in the work itself, for the sake, that is to say, of
the merits of his good will; so that grace is rendered as due,—not given
as not due,—and thus grace is made no more grace. <span
id="fr_2602"></span>[2603](#fn_2602) But this is what, in the
Palestinian judgment, Pelagius with a deceitful heart condemned,—that
the grace of God, namely, is given according to our merits. Tell me, I
beseech you, what good, Paul, while he was as yet Saul, willed, and not
rather great evils, when breathing out slaughter he went, in horrible
darkness of mind and madness, to lay waste the Christians? <span
id="fr_2603"></span>[2604](#fn_2603) For what merits of a good will did
God convert him by a marvellous and sudden calling from those evils to
good things? What shall I say, when he himself cries, “Not by works of
righteousness that we have done, but according to His mercy He saved
us”? <span id="fr_2604"></span>[2605](#fn_2604) What is that which I
have already mentioned <span id="fr_2605"></span>[2606](#fn_2605) as
having been said by the Lord, “No one can come to me,”—which is
understood as “believe on me,”—unless it were given him of my
Father”? <span id="fr_2606"></span>[2607](#fn_2606) Whether is this
given to him who is already willing to believe, for the sake of the
merits of a good will? or rather is the will itself, as in the case of
Saul, stirred up from above, that he may believe, even although he is so
averse from the <span id="page_389">p. 389</span> <span
id="xviii.iii.xxxvii-Page_389"></span>faith as even to persecute the
believers? For how has the Lord commanded us to pray for those who
persecute us? Do we pray thus that the grace of God may be recompensed
them for the sake of their good will, and not rather that the evil will
itself may be changed into a good one? Just as we believe that at that
time the saints whom he was persecuting did not pray for Saul in vain,
that his will might be converted to the faith which he was destroying.
And indeed that his conversion was effected from above, appeared even by
a manifest miracle. But how many enemies of Christ are at the present
day suddenly drawn by God’s secret grace to Christ! And if I had not set
down this word from the gospel, what things would that man have said in
this behalf concerning me, since even now he is stirring, not against
me, but against Him who cries, “No man can come to me, except the Father
who hath sent me draw him”! <span id="fr_2607"></span>[2608](#fn_2607)
For He does not say, “except He lead him,” so that we can thus in any
way understand that his will precedes. For who is “drawn,” if he was
already willing? And yet no man comes unless he is willing. Therefore he
is drawn in wondrous ways to will, by Him who knows how to work within
the very hearts of men. Not that men who are unwilling should believe,
which cannot be, but that they should be made willing from being
unwilling.
