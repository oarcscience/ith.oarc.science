<span id="xx.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—They Who Have Not Received
Perseverance are Not Distinguished from the Mass of Those that are
Lost.</span>

<span id="xx.xv-p2"></span>And, consequently, both those who have not
heard the gospel, and those who, having heard it and been changed by it
for the better, have not received perseverance, and those who, having
heard the gospel, have refused to come to Christ, that is, to believe on
Him, since He Himself says, “No man cometh unto me, except it were given
him of my Father,” <span id="fr_3287"></span>[3288](#fn_3287) and those
who by their tender age were unable to believe, but might be absolved
from original sin by the sole laver of regeneration, and yet have not
received this laver, and have perished in death: are not made to differ
from that lump which it is plain is condemned, as all go from one into
condemnation. Some are made to differ, however, not by their own merits,
but by the grace of the Mediator; that is to say, they are justified
freely in the blood of the second Adam. Therefore, when we hear, “For
who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou hast not
received? Now, if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if thou
hadst not received it?” <span id="fr_3288"></span>[3289](#fn_3288) we
ought to understand that from that mass of perdition which originated
through the first Adam, no one can be made to differ except he who has
this gift, which whosoever has, has received by the grace of the
Saviour. And this apostolical testimony is so great, that the blessed
Cyprian writing to Quirinus put it in the place of a title, when he
says, “That we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.” <span
