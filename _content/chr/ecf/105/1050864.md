<span id="xviii.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22 \[X.\]—According to Whose
Purpose the Elect are Called.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.xxii-p2"></span>Why, then, is it that, in what
follows, where they mention what they themselves think, they say they
confess “That grace also assists the good purpose of every one, but that
yet it does not infuse the desire of virtue into a reluctant heart”?
Because they so say this as if man of himself, without God’s assistance,
has a good purpose and a desire of virtue; and this precedent merit is
worthy of being assisted by the subsequent grace of God. For they think,
perchance, that the apostle thus said, “For we know that He worketh all
things for good to them that love God, to them who are called according
to the purpose,” <span id="fr_2669"></span>[2670](#fn_2669) so as to
wish the purpose of man to be understood, which purpose, as a good
merit, the mercy of the God that calleth might follow; being ignorant
that it is said, “Who are called according to the purpose,” so that
there may be understood the purpose of God, not man, whereby those whom
He foreknew and predestinated as conformed to the image of His Son, He
elected before the foundation of the world. For not all the called are
called according to purpose, since “many are called, few are
chosen.” <span id="fr_2670"></span>[2671](#fn_2670) They, therefore, are
called according to the purpose, who were elected before the foundation
of the world. Of this purpose of God, that also was said which I have
already mentioned concerning the twins Esau and Jacob, “That according
to the election the purpose of God might remain, not of works, but of
Him that calleth; it was said, that the elder shall serve the
younger.” <span id="fr_2671"></span>[2672](#fn_2671) This purpose of God
is also mentioned in that place where, writing to Timothy, he says,
“Labour with the gospel according to the power of God, who saves us and
calls us with this holy calling; not according to our works, but
according to His purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ
Jesus before the eternal ages, but is now made manifest by the coming of
our Saviour Jesus Christ.” <span id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672)
This, then, is the purpose of God, whereof it is said, “He worketh
together all things for good for those who are called according to the
purpose.” But subsequent grace indeed assists man’s good purpose, but
the purpose would not itself exist if grace did not precede. The desire
of man, also, which is called good, although in beginning to exist it is
aided by grace, yet does not begin without grace, but is inspired by Him
of whom the apostle says, “But thanks be to God, who has given the same
desire for you in the heart of Titus.” <span
id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673) If God gives desire that every one
may have it for others, who else will give it that a man may have it for
himself?
