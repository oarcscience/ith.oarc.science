id="xi.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38 \[XXIII.\]—The Re-Formation Which is
Now Being Effected, Compared with the Perfection of the Life to
Come.</span>

<span id="xi.xli-p2"></span>But what is this change, and how great, in
<span id="page_99">p. 99</span> <span
id="xi.xli-Page_99"></span>comparison with the perfect eminence which is
then to be realized? The apostle applies some sort of illustration,
derived from well-known things, to these indescribable things, comparing
the period of childhood with the age of manhood. “When I was a child,”
says he, “I used to speak as a child, to understand as a child, to think
as a child; but when I became a man, I put aside childish things.”
 <span id="fr_881"></span>[882](#fn_881) He then immediately explains
why he said this in these words: “For now we see by means of a mirror,
darkly but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know
even as also I am known.” <span id="fr_882"></span>[883](#fn_882)
