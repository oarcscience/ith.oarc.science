<span id="xix.iv.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33 \[XVII.\]—A Good Will May Be
Small and Weak; An Ample Will, Great Love. Operating and Co-operating
Grace.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span>He, therefore, who wishes to do God’s
commandment, but is unable, already possesses a good will, but as yet a
small and weak one; he will, however, become able when he shall have
acquired a great and robust will. When the martyrs did the great
commandments which they obeyed, they acted by a great will,—that is,
with great love. Of this love the Lord Himself thus speaks: “Greater
love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his
friends.”  <span id="fr_3130"></span>[3131](#fn_3130) In accordance with
this, the apostle also says, “He that loveth his neighbour hath
fulfilled the law. For this: Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt
not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be
any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying,
namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. <span
id="fr_3131"></span>[3132](#fn_3131) Love worketh no ill to his
neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the <span
id="page_458">p. 458</span> <span
id="xix.iv.xxxiii-Page_458"></span>law.” <span
id="fr_3132"></span>[3133](#fn_3132) This love the Apostle Peter did not
yet possess, when he for fear thrice denied the Lord. <span
id="fr_3133"></span>[3134](#fn_3133) “There is no fear in love,” says
the Evangelist John in his first Epistle, “but perfect love casteth out
fear.” <span id="fr_3134"></span>[3135](#fn_3134) But yet, however small
and imperfect his love was, it was not wholly wanting when he said to
the Lord, “I will lay down my life for Thy sake;” <span
id="fr_3135"></span>[3136](#fn_3135) for he supposed himself able to
effect what he felt himself willing to do. And who was it that had begun
to give him his love, however small, but He who prepares the will, and
perfects by His co-operation what He initiates by His operation?
Forasmuch as in beginning He works in us that we may have the will, and
in perfecting works with us when we have the will. <span
id="fr_3136"></span>[3137](#fn_3136) On which account the apostle says,
“I am confident of this very thing, that He which hath begun a good work
in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_3137"></span>[3138](#fn_3137) He operates, therefore, without us,
in order that we may will; but when we will, and so will that we may
act, He co-operates with us. We can, however, ourselves do nothing to
effect good works of piety without Him either working that we may will,
or co-working when we will. Now, concerning His working that we may
will, it is said: “It is God which worketh in you, even to will.” <span
id="fr_3138"></span>[3139](#fn_3138) While of His co-working with us,
when we will and act by willing, the apostle says, “We know that in all
things there is co-working for good to them that love God.” <span
id="fr_3139"></span>[3140](#fn_3139) What does this phrase, “all
things,” mean, but the terrible and cruel sufferings which affect our
condition? That burden, indeed, of Christ, which is heavy for our
infirmity, becomes light to love. For to such did the Lord say that His
burden was light, <span id="fr_3140"></span>[3141](#fn_3140) as Peter
was when he suffered for Christ, not as he was when he denied Him.
