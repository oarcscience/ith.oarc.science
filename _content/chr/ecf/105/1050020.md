<span id="x.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—If Adam Had Not Sinned, He
Would Never Have Died.</span>

<span id="x.iii.ii-p2"></span>They who say that Adam was so formed that
he would even without any demerit of sin have died, not as the penalty
of sin, but from the necessity of his being, endeavour indeed to refer
that passage in the law, which says: “On the day ye eat thereof ye shall
surely die,” <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210) not to the death of
<span id="page_16">p. 16</span> <span id="x.iii.ii-Page_16"></span>the
body, but to that death of the soul which takes place in sin. It is the
unbelievers who have died this death, to whom the Lord pointed when He
said, “Let the dead bury their dead.” <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211) Now what will be their answer, when we
read that God, when reproving and sentencing the first man after his
sin, said to him, “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou
return?” <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212) For it was not in
respect of his soul that he was “dust,” but clearly by reason of his
body, and it was by the death of the self-same body that he was destined
to “return to dust.” Still, although it was by reason of his body that
he was dust, and although he bare about the natural body in which he was
created, he would, if he had not sinned, have been changed into a
spiritual body, and would have passed into the incorruptible state,
which is promised to the faithful and the saints, without the peril of
death. <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213) And for this issue we not
only are conscious in ourselves of having an earnest desire, but we
learn it from the apostle’s intimation, when he says: “For in this we
groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from
heaven; if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. For we
that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we
would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up
of life.”  <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214) Therefore, if Adam
had not sinned, he would not have been divested of his body, but would
have been clothed upon with immortality and incorruption, that
“mortality might have been swallowed up of life;” that is, that he might
have passed from the natural body into the spiritual body.
