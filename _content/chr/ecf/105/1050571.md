<span id="xvi.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[V.\]—The Censuring of Lust is Not
a Condemnation of Marriage; Whence Comes Shame in the Human Body. Adam
and Eve Were Not Created Blind; Meaning of Their “Eyes Being
Opened.”</span>

<span id="xvi.v.vi-p2"></span>Now, this being the real state of the
question, they undoubtedly err who suppose that, when fleshly lust is
censured, marriage is condemned; as if the malady of concupiscence was
the outcome of marriage and not of sin. Were not those first spouses,
whose nuptials God blessed with the words, “Be fruitful and
multiply,” <span id="fr_2072"></span>[2073](#fn_2072) naked, and yet not
ashamed? Why, then, did shame arise out of their members after sin,
except because an indecent motion arose from them, which, if men had not
sinned, would certainly never have existed in marriage? Or was it,
forsooth, as some hold (who give little heed to what they read), that
human beings were, like dogs, at first created blind; and—absurder
still—obtained sight, not as dogs do, by growing, but by sinning? Far be
it from us to entertain such an opinion. But they gather that opinion of
theirs from reading: “She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and
gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat: and the eyes of
them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.” <span
id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073) This accounts for the opinion of
unintelligent persons, that the eyes of the first man and woman were
previously closed, because Holy Scripture testifies that they were <span
id="page_266">p. 266</span> <span id="xvi.v.vi-Page_266"></span>then
opened. Well, then, were Hagar’s eyes, the handmaid of Sarah, previously
shut, when, with her thirsty and sobbing child, she opened her
eyes <span id="fr_2074"></span>[2075](#fn_2074) and saw the well? Or did
those two disciples, after the Lord’s resurrection, walk in the way with
Him with their eyes shut, since the evangelist says of them that “in the
breaking of bread their eyes were opened, and they knew Him”? <span
id="fr_2075"></span>[2076](#fn_2075) What, therefore, is written
concerning the first man and woman, that “the eyes of them both were
opened,” <span id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076) we ought to
understand as that they gave attention to perceiving and recognising the
new state which had befallen their body. Now that their eyes were
opened, their body appeared to them naked, and they knew it. If this
were not the meaning, how, when the beast of the field and the fowls of
the air were brought unto him, <span
id="fr_2077"></span>[2078](#fn_2077) could Adam have given them names if
his eyes were shut? He could not have done this without distinguishing
them; and he could not distinguish them without seeing them. How, too,
could the woman herself have been beheld so clearly by him when he said,
“This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh”? <span
id="fr_2078"></span>[2079](#fn_2078) If, indeed, any one shall be so
determined on cavilling as to insist that Adam might have acquired a
discernment of these objects, not by sight but by touch, what
explanation will he have to give of the passage wherein we are told how
the woman “saw that the tree,” from which she was about to pluck the
forbidden fruit, “was pleasant for the eyes to behold”? <span
id="fr_2079"></span>[2080](#fn_2079) No; “they were both naked, and were
not ashamed,” <span id="fr_2080"></span>[2081](#fn_2080) not because
they had no eyesight, but because they perceived no reason to be ashamed
in their members, which had all along been seen by them. For it is not
said: They were both naked, *and knew it not*; but “they were not
ashamed.” Because, indeed, nothing had previously happened which was not
lawful, so nothing had ensued which could cause them shame.
