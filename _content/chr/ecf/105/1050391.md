<span id="xiv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6.—Pelagius’ Answer Examined.</span>

<span id="xiv.x-p2"></span>Indeed, in this very book which contains
these statements, after laying down the position, “All men are governed
by their own will, and every one is submitted to his own desire,”
Pelagius goes on to adduce the testimony of Scripture, from which it is
evident enough that no man ought to trust to himself for direction. For
on this very subject the Wisdom of Solomon declares: “I myself also am a
mortal man like unto all; and the offspring of him that was first made
of the earth,” <span id="fr_1613"></span>[1614](#fn_1613) —with other
similar words to the conclusion of the paragraph, where we read: “For
all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out therefrom:
wherefore I prayed and understanding was given to me; I called, and the
Spirit of Wisdom came into me.” <span
id="fr_1614"></span>[1615](#fn_1614) Now is it not clearer than light
itself, how that this man, on duly considering the wretchedness of human
frailty, did not dare to commit himself to his own direction, but
prayed, and understanding was given to him, concerning which the apostle
says: “But we have the understanding of the Lord;” <span
id="fr_1615"></span>[1616](#fn_1615) and called, and the Spirit of <span
id="page_186">p. 186</span> <span id="xiv.x-Page_186"></span>Wisdom
entered into him? Now it is by this Spirit, and not by the strength of
their own will, that they who are God’s children are governed and led.
