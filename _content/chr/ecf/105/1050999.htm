<p><a name="xx.xviii-p2"></A>Rightly follows the word to the kingdom of the elect: &#8220;If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how has He not also with Him given us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God&#146;s elect? God who justifieth? Who condemneth? Christ who died? yea, rather who rose again also, who is at the right hand of God, who also soliciteth on our behalf?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3298"></A><A HREF="#fn_3298"><FONT SIZE="1">3299</FONT></A>
 And of how stedfast a perseverance even to the end they have received the gift, let them follow on to say: &#8220;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. But in all these things we are more than conquerors, through Him that hath loved us. For I am certain, that neither death, nor life, nor angel, nor principality, nor things present, nor things to come, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3299"></A><A HREF="#fn_3299"><FONT SIZE="1">3300</FONT></A>
