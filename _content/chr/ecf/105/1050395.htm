<p><a name="xiv.xiv-p2"></A>But what Pelagius added, &#8220;Who believes differently is an Origenist,&#8221; was approved by the judges, because in very deed the Church most justly abominates the opinion of Origen, that even they whom the Lord says are to be punished with everlasting punishment, and the devil himself and his angels, after a time, however protracted, will be purged, and released from their penalties, and shall then cleave to the saints who reign with God in the association of blessedness. This additional sentence, therefore, the synod pronounced to be &#8220;not opposed to the Church,&#8221;&#8212;not in accordance with Pelagius, but rather in accordance with the Gospel, that such ungodly and sinful men shall be consumed by eternal fires as the Gospel determines to be worthy of such a punishment; and that he is a sharer in Origen&#146;s abominable opinion, who affirms that their punishment can possibly ever come to an end, when the Lord has said it is to be eternal. Concerning those sinners, however, of whom the apostle declares that &#8220;they shall be saved, yet so as by fire, after their work has been burnt up,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1630"></A><A HREF="#fn_1630"><FONT SIZE="1">1631</FONT></A>
 inasmuch as no objectionable opinion in reference to them was manifestly charged against Pelagius, the synod determined nothing. Wherefore he who says that the ungodly and sinner, whom the truth consigns to eternal punishment, can ever be liberated therefrom, is not unfitly designated by Pelagius as an &#8220;<i>Origenist</i>.&#8221; But, on the other hand, he who supposes that no sinner whatever deserves mercy in the judgment of God, may be designated by whatever name Pelagius is disposed to give to him, only it must at the same time be quite understood that this error is not received as truth by the Church. &#8220;For he shall have judgment without mercy that hath showed no mercy.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1631"></A><A HREF="#fn_1631"><FONT SIZE="1">1632</FONT></A>
