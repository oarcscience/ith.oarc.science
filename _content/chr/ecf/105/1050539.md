<span id="xv.iv.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28 \[XXIV.\]—The Heresy of
Pelagius and Cœlestius Aims at the Very Foundations of Our Faith.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>This is, however, in the matter of the
two men by one of whom we are sold under sin, <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957) by the other redeemed from sins—by
the one have been precipitated into death, by the other are liberated
unto life; the former of whom has ruined us in himself, by doing his own
will instead of His who created him; the latter has saved us in Himself,
by not doing His own will, <span id="page_246">p. 246</span> <span
id="xv.iv.xxviii-Page_246"></span>but the will of Him who sent
Him: <span id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958) and it is in what
concerns these two men that the Christian faith properly consists. For
“there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus;” <span id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959) since “there is none
other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved;” <span
id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960) and “in Him hath God defined unto
all men their faith, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.” <span
id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961) Now without this faith, that is to
say, without a belief in the one Mediator between God and men, the man
Christ Jesus; without faith, I say, in His resurrection by which God has
given assurance to all men and which no man could of course truly
believe were it not for His incarnation and death; without faith,
therefore, in the incarnation and death and resurrection of Christ, the
Christian verity unhesitatingly declares that the ancient saints could
not possibly have been cleansed from sin so as to have become holy, and
justified by the grace of God. And this is true both of the saints who
are mentioned in Holy Scripture, and of those also who are not indeed
mentioned therein, but must yet be supposed to have existed,—either
before the deluge, or in the interval between that event and the giving
of the law, or in the period of the law itself,—not merely among the
children of Israel, as the prophets, but even outside that nation, as
for instance Job. For it was by the self-same faith in the one Mediator
that the hearts of these, too, were cleansed, and there also was “shed
abroad in them the love of God by the Holy Ghost,” <span
id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962) “who bloweth where He
listeth,” <span id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963) not following men’s
merits, but even producing these very merits Himself. For the grace of
God will in no wise exist unless it be wholly free.
