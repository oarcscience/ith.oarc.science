id="xx.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42.—The Reprobate are to Be Punished for
Merits of a Different Kind.</span>

<span id="xx.xlv-p2"></span>But those who do not belong to this number
of the predestinated, whom—whether that they have not yet any free
choice of their will, or with a choice of will truly free, because freed
by grace itself—the grace of God brings to His kingdom,—those, then, who
do not belong to that most certain and blessed number, are most
righteously judged according to their deservings. For either they lie
under the sin which they have inherited by original generation, and
depart hence with that inherited debt which is not put away by
regeneration, or by their free will have added other sins besides; their
will, I say, *free*, but not *freed*,—free from righteousness, but
enslaved to sin, by which they are tossed about by divers mischievous
lusts, some more evil, some less, but all evil; and they must be
adjudged to diverse punishments, according to that very diversity. Or
they receive the grace of God, but they are only for a season, and do
not persevere; they forsake and are forsaken. For by their free will, as
they have not received the gift of perseverance, they are sent away by
the righteous and hidden judgment of God.
