<span id="x.iv.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27. <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565) —The Divine Remedy for Pride.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxvii-p3"></span>You cannot therefore attribute to God
the cause of any human fault. For of all human offences, the cause is
pride. For the conviction and removal of this a great remedy comes from
heaven. God in mercy humbles Himself, descends from above, and displays
to man, lifted up by pride, pure and manifest grace in very manhood,
which He took upon Himself out of vast love for those who partake of it.
For, not even did even this One, so conjoined to the Word of God that by
that conjunction he became at once the one Son of God and the same One
the one Son of man, act by the antecedent merits of His own will. It
behoved Him, without doubt, to be one; had there been two, or three, or
more, if this could have been done, it would not have come from the pure
and simple gift of God, but from man’s free will and choice. <span
id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566) This, then, is especially commended to
us; this, so far as I dare to think, is the divine lesson especially
taught and learned in those treasures of wisdom and knowledge which are
hidden in Christ. Every one of us, therefore, now knows, now does not
know—now rejoices, now does not rejoice—to begin, continue, and complete
our good work, in order that he may know that it is due not to his own
will, but to the gift of God, that he either knows or rejoices; and thus
he is cured <span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span
id="x.iv.xxvii-Page_56"></span>of vanity which elated him, and knows how
truly it is said not of this earth of ours, but spiritually, “The Lord
will give kindness and sweet grace, and our land shall yield her
fruit.” <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567) A good work, moreover,
affords greater delight, in proportion as God is more and more loved as
the highest unchangeable Good, and as the Author of all good things of
every kind whatever. And that God may be loved, “His love is shed abroad
in our hearts,” not by ourselves, but “by the Holy Ghost that is given
unto us.” <span id="fr_568"></span>[569](#fn_568)
