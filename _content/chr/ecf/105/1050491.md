id="xv.iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36 \[XXXIII.\]—Cœlestius Openly
Declares Infants to Have No Original Sin.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxxvi-p2"></span>Who would believe that, under so clear
a confession, there is concealed a contrary meaning, if Cœlestius had
not exposed it? He who in that book of his, which he quoted at Rome in
the ecclesiastical proceedings there, <span
id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877) distinctly acknowledged that
“infants too are baptized for the remission of sins,” also denied “that
they have any original sin.” But let us now observe what Pelagius
thought, not about the baptism of infants, but rather about the
assistance of divine grace, in this exposition of his belief which he
forwarded to Rome. “We confess,” says he, “free will in such a sense
that we declare ourselves to be always in need of the help of God.”
Well, now, we ask again, what the help is which he says we require; and
again we find ambiguity, since he may possibly answer that he meant the
law and the teaching of Christ, whereby that natural “capacity” is
assisted. We, however, on our side require them to acknowledge a grace
like that which the apostle describes, when he says: “For God hath not
given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound
mind;” <span id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878) although it does not
follow by any means that the man who has the gift of knowledge, whereby
he has discovered what he ought to do, has also the grace of love so as
to do it.
