<span id="xi.xliv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—The Law Written in the Heart, and
the Reward of the Eternal Contemplation of God, Belong to the New
Covenant; Who Among the Saints are the Least and the Greatest.</span>

<span id="xi.xliv-p2"></span>As then the law of works, which was written
on the tables of stone, and its reward, the land of promise, which the
house of the carnal Israel after their liberation from Egypt received,
belonged to the old testament, so the law of faith, written on the
heart, and its reward, the beatific vision which the house of the
spiritual Israel, when delivered from the present world, shall perceive,
belong to the new testament. Then shall come to pass what the apostle
describes: “Whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there
be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall
vanish away,” <span id="fr_897"></span>[898](#fn_897) —even that
imperfect knowledge of “the child” <span
id="fr_898"></span>[899](#fn_898) in which this present life is passed,
and which is but “in part,” “by means of a mirror darkly.” <span
id="fr_899"></span>[900](#fn_899) Because of this, indeed, “prophecy” is
necessary, for still to the past succeeds the future; and because of
this, too, “tongues” are required,—that is, a multiplicity of
expressions, since it is by different ones that different things are
suggested to him who does not as yet contemplate with a perfectly
purified mind the everlasting light of transparent truth. “When that,
however, which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be
done away,”  <span id="fr_900"></span>[901](#fn_900) then, what appeared
to the flesh in assumed flesh shall display Itself as It is in Itself to
all who love It; then, there shall be eternal life for us to know the
one very God; <span id="fr_901"></span>[902](#fn_901) then shall we be
like Him, <span id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902) because “we shall then
know, even as we are known;” <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903)
then “they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man
his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know me, from the
least unto the greatest of them.” <span
id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904) Now this may be understood in several
ways: Either, that in that life the saints shall differ one from another
in glory, as star from star. It matters not how the expression
runs,—whether (as in the passage before us) it be, “From the least unto
the greatest of them,” or the other way, From the greatest unto the
least. And, in like manner, it matters not even if we understand “*the
least*” to mean those who simply believe, and “*the greatest*” those who
have been further able to understand—so far as may be in this world—the
light which is incorporeal and unchangeable. Or, “*the least*” may mean
those who are later in time; whilst by “*the greatest*” He may have
intended to indicate those who were prior in time. For they are all to
receive the promised vision of God hereafter, since it was for us that
they foresaw the future which would be better than their present, that
they without us should not arrive at complete perfection.  <span
id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905) And so the earlier are found to be the
lesser, because they were less deferred in time; as in the case of the
gospel “penny a day,” which is given for an illustration. <span
id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906) This penny they are the first to
receive who came last into the vineyard. Or, “the least and the
greatest” ought perhaps to be taken in some other sense, which at
present does not occur to my mind.
