<span id="xv.iii.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28 \[XXVII.\]—Pelagius Teaches
that Satan May Be Resisted Without the Help of the Grace of God.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>In the book which he addressed to a
certain holy virgin, there is a passage which I have already
mentioned, <span id="fr_1862"></span>[1863](#fn_1862) wherein he plainly
indicates what he holds on this subject; for he speaks of our “deserving
the grace of God, and by the help of the Holy Ghost *more easily*
resisting the evil spirit.” Now why did he insert the phrase “more
easily”? Was not the sense already complete: “And by the help of the
Holy Ghost resisting the evil spirit”? But who can fail to perceive what
an injury he has done by this insertion? He wants it, of course, to be
supposed, that so great are the powers of our nature, which he is in
such a hurry to exalt,that even without the assistance of the Holy Ghost
the evil spirit can be resisted—less easily it may be, but still in a
certain measure.
