<p><a name="xvi.vi.xix-p2"></A>But now, I pray you, look a little more attentively, and observe how he contrives to find a name wherewith to cover again what he blushes to unfold. &#8220;For,&#8221; says he, &#8220;Adam begot him by the power of his members, not by diversity of merits.&#8221; Now I confess I do not understand what he meant by the latter clause, <i>not by diversity of merits</i>; but when he said, &#8220;by the power of his members,&#8221; I believe he wished to express what he is ashamed to say openly and clearly. He preferred to use the phrase, &#8220;by the power of his members,&#8221; rather than say, &#8220;by the lust of the flesh.&#8221; Plainly&#8212;even if the thought did not occur to him&#8212;he intimated a something which has an evident application to the subject. For what is more powerful than a man&#146;s members, when they are not in due submission to a man&#146;s will? Even if they be restrained by temperance or continence, their use and control are not in any man&#146;s power. Adam, then, begat his sons by what our author calls &#8220;the power of his members,&#8221; over which, before he begat them, he blushed, after his sin. If, however, he had never sinned, he would not have begotten them by the <i>power</i>, but in the <i>obedience</i>, of his members. For he would himself have had the <i>power</i> to rule them as subjects to his will, if he, too, by the same will had only submitted himself as a subject to a more powerful One.</p>
