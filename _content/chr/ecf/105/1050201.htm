<p class="c46"><a name="xi.xxviii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xi.xxviii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 25.&#8212;The Passage in Romans.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xi.xxviii-p2"></A>Now carefully consider this entire passage, and see whether it says anything about circumcision, or the Sabbath, or anything else pertaining to a foreshadowing sacrament. Does not its whole scope amount to this, that the letter which forbids sin fails to give man life, but rather &#8220;killeth,&#8221; by increasing concupiscence, and aggravating sinfulness by transgression, unless indeed grace liberates us by the law of faith, which is in Christ Jesus, when His love is &#8220;shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given to us?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_816"></A><A HREF="#fn_816"><FONT SIZE="1">817</FONT></A>
 The apostle having used these words: &#8220;That we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_817"></A><A HREF="#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">818</FONT></A>
 goes on to inquire, &#8220;What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay; I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment deceived me, and by it slew me. Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. For we know that the law is spiritual; whereas I am carnal, sold under sin. For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that I do. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. But then it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing. To will, indeed, is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ out Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_818"></A><A HREF="#fn_818"><FONT SIZE="1">819</FONT></A>
