<span id="xviii.iii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29 \[XV.\]—Julian Opposes the
Faith of His Friends to the Opinions of Catholic Believers. First of
All, of Free Will.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxix-p2"></span>Now therefore let us see, for the
rest, in what way—after thinking that he might calumniously object
against me what I believe, and feign what I do not believe—he himself
professes his own faith or that of the Pelagians. “In opposition to
these things,” he says, “we daily argue, and we are unwilling to yield
our consent to transgressors, because we say that free will is in all by
nature, and could not perish by the sin of Adam; which assertion is
confirmed by the authority of all Scriptures.” If in any degree it is
necessary to say this, you should not say it against the grace of
God,—you should not give your consent to transgressors, but you should
correct your opinion. But about this, as much as I could, and as far as
it seemed to be sufficient, I have argued above.
