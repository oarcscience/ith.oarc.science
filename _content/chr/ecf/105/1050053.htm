<p><a name="x.iii.xxxv-p2"></A>&#8220;I am come,&#8221; says Christ, &#8220;a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_320"><FONT SIZE="1">321</FONT></A>
 Now what does this passage show us, but that every person is in darkness who does not believe on Him, and that it is by believing on Him that he escapes from this permanent state of darkness? What do we understand by the <i>darkness</i> but sin? And whatever else it may embrace in its meaning, at any rate he who believes not in Christ will &#8220;abide in darkness,&#8221;&#8212;which, of course, is a penal state, not, as the darkness of the night, necessary for the refreshment of living beings. [XXV.] So that infants, unless they pass into the number of believers through the sacrament which was divinely instituted for this purpose, will undoubtedly remain in this darkness.</p>
