<span id="xvi.v.xxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37 \[XXXII.\]—The Law of Sin with
Its Guilt in Unbaptized Infants. By Adam’s Sin the Human Race Has Become
a “Wild Olive Tree.”</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxxvii-p2"></span>Until, then, this remission of sins
takes place in the offspring, they have within them the law of sin in
such manner, that it is really imputed to them as sin; in other words,
with that law there is attaching to them its sentence of guilt, which
holds them debtors to eternal condemnation. For what a parent transmits
to his carnal offspring is the condition of his own carnal birth, not
that of his spiritual new birth. For, that he was born in the flesh,
although no hindrance after the remission of his guilt to his fruit,
still remains hidden, as it were, in the seed of the olive, even though,
because of the remission of his sins, it in no respect injures the
oil—that is, in plain language, his life which he lives, “righteous by
faith,” <span id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183) after Christ, whose
very name comes from the oil, that is, from the anointing. <span
id="fr_2184"></span>[2185](#fn_2184) That, however, which in the case of
a regenerate parent, as in the seed of the pure olive, is covered
without any guilt, which has been remitted, is still no doubt retained
in the case of his offspring, which is yet unregenerate, as in the wild
olive, with all its guilt, until here also it be remitted by the
self-same grace. When Adam sinned, he was changed from that pure olive,
which had no such corrupt seed whence should spring the bitter issue of
the wild olive, into a wild olive tree; and, inasmuch as his sin was so
great, that by it his nature became commensurately changed for the
worse, he converted the entire race of man into a wild olive stock. The
effect of this change we see illustrated, as has been said above, in the
instance of these very trees. Whenever God’s grace converts a sapling
into a good olive, so that the fault of the first birth (that original
sin which had been derived and contracted from the concupiscence of the
flesh) is remitted, covered, and not imputed, there is still inherent in
it that nature from which is born a wild olive, unless it, too, by the
same grace, is by the second birth changed into a good olive.
