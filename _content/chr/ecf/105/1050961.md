id="xix.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27 \[XIV.\]—Grace Effects the
Fulfilment of the Law, the Deliverance of Nature, and the Suppression of
Sin’s Dominion.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxvii-p2"></span>It has, however, been shown to
demonstration that instead of really maintaining free will, they have
only inflated a theory of it, which, having no stability, has fallen to
the ground. Neither the knowledge of God’s law, nor nature, nor the mere
remission of sins is that grace which is given to us through our Lord
Jesus Christ; but it is this very grace which accomplishes the
fulfilment of the law, and the liberation of nature, and the removal of
the dominion of sin. Being, therefore, convicted on these points, they
resort to another expedient, and endeavour to show in some way or other
that the grace of God is given us according to our merits. For they say:
“Granted that it is not given to us according to the merits of good
works, inasmuch as it is through it that we do any good thing, still it
is given to us according to the merits of a good will; for,” say they,
“the good will of him who prays precedes his prayer, even as the will of
the believer preceded his faith, so that according to these merits the
grace of God who hears, follows.”
