<span id="xxi.iii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10 \[VI.\]—The Gift of Perseverance
Can Be Obtained by Prayer.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xii-p2"></span>But you write that “these brethren will
not have this perseverance so preached as that it cannot be obtained by
prayer or lost by obstinacy.” <span id="fr_3577"></span>[3578](#fn_3577)
In this they are little careful in considering what they say. For we are
speaking of that perseverance whereby one perseveres unto the end, and
if this is given, one does persevere unto the end; but if one does not
persevere unto the end, it is not given, which I have already
sufficiently discussed above. Let not men say, then, that perseverance
is given to any one to the end, except when the end itself has come, and
he to whom it has been given has been found to have persevered unto the
end. Certainly, we say that one whom we have known to be chaste is
chaste, whether he should continue or not in the same chastity; and if
he should have any other divine endowment which may be kept and lost, we
say that he has it as long as he has it; and if he should lose it, we
say that he had it. But since no one has perseverance to the end except
he who does persevere to the end, many people may have it, but none can
lose it. For it is not to be feared that perchance when a man has
persevered unto the end, some evil will may arise in him, so that he
does not persevere unto the end. This gift of God, therefore, may be
obtained by prayer, but when it has been given, it cannot be lost by
contumacy. For when any one has persevered unto the end, he neither can
lose this gift, nor others which he could lose before the end. How,
then, can that be lost, whereby it is brought about that even that which
could be lost is not lost?
