As the case, however, now stands, he has not only not acknowledged his liberation from his pestilential error; but, as if that were a small thing, he has gone on to anathematize men who have reached that freedom, who love him so well that they would fain desire his own emancipation. Amongst these are those very men who have expressed their good-will towards him in the letter, which they forwarded to me. For he it was whom they had chiefly in view when they said how much they were affected at the fact of my having at last written that work. &#8220;If, indeed, it has happened,&#8221; they say, &#8220;that some are removed from the influence of this clearest light of truth, whose blindness required its illumination, yet even to them,&#8221; they go on to remark, &#8220;we doubt not, the self-same grace will find its way, by the merciful favour of God.&#8221; Any name, or names, even they, too, thought it desirable as yet to suppress, in order that, if friendship still lived on, the error of the friends might the more surely die.</p>
