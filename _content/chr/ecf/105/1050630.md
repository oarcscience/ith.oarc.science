<span id="xvi.vi.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[X.\]—The Pelagians Affirm that
God in the Case of Abraham and Sarah Aroused Concupiscence as a Gift
from Heaven.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxiv-p2"></span>He has much also to say, though to no
purpose, concerning Abraham and Sarah, how they received a son according
to the promise; and at last he mentions the word *concupiscence.* But
<span id="page_292">p. 292</span> <span
id="xvi.vi.xxiv-Page_292"></span>he does not add the usual phrase, “of
the flesh,” because this is the very thing which causes the shame.
Whereas, on account of concupiscence there is sometimes a call for
boasting, inasmuch as there is a concupiscence of the spirit against the
flesh,  <span id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243) and a concupiscence
of wisdom. <span id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244) Accordingly, he
says: “Now you have certainly defined as naturally evil this
concupiscence which is indispensable for fecundity; whence comes it,
therefore, that it is aroused in aged men by the gift of Heaven? Make it
clear then, if you can, that that belongs to the devil’s work, which you
see is conferred by God as a gift.” He says this, just as if
concupiscence of the flesh had been previously wanting in them, and as
if God had bestowed it upon them. No doubt it was inherent in this body
of death; that fecundity, however, was wanting of which God is the
author; and this was actually given whensoever God willed to confer the
gift. Be it, however, far from us to affirm, what he thought we meant to
say, that Isaac was begotten without the heat of sexual union.
