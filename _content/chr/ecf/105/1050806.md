<span id="xviii.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—He Concludes that He Does Not
Deprive the Wicked of Free Will.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.vii-p2"></span>It is not, therefore, true, as some
affirm that we say, and as that correspondent of yours ventures moreover
to write, that “all are forced into sin,” as if they were unwilling, “by
the necessity of their flesh;” but if they are already of the age to use
the choice of their own mind, they are both retained in sin by their own
will, and by their own will are hurried along from sin to sin. For even
he who persuades and deceives does not act in them, except that they may
commit sin by their will, either by ignorance of the truth or by delight
in iniquity, or by both evils,—as well of blindness as of weakness. But
this will, which is free in evil things because it takes pleasure in
evil, is not free in good things, for the reason that it has not been
made free. Nor can a man will any good thing unless he is aided by Him
who cannot will evil,—that is, by the grace of God through Jesus Christ
our Lord. For “everything which is not of faith is sin.”  <span
id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538) And thus the good will which
withdraws itself from sin is faithful, because the just lives by
faith. <span id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539) And it pertains to
faith to believe on Christ. And no man can believe on Christ—that is,
come to Him—unless it be given to him. <span
id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540) No man, therefore, can have a
righteous will, unless, with no foregoing merits, he has received the
true, that is, the gratuitous grace from above.
