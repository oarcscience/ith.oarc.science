<p><a name="xviii.vi.i-p2"></A><span class="c16"><a name="xviii.vi.i-p2.1"></A>After</span> the matters which I have considered, and to which I have answered, they repeat the same things as those contained in the letter which I have refuted, but in a different manner. For before, they put them forward as objecting to us things which we think as it were falsely; but afterwards, as explaining what they themselves think, they have presented the same things from the opposite side, adding two certain points which they had not mentioned&#8212;that is, &#8220;that they say that baptism is necessary for all ages,&#8221; and &#8220;that by Adam death passed upon us, not sins,&#8221; which things must also themselves be considered in their own place. Hence, because in the former Book which I have just finished I said that they alleged hindrances of five matters in which lurk their dogmas hostile to God&#146;s grace and to the catholic faith,&#8212;the praise, to wit, of the creature, the praise of marriage, the praise of the law, the praise of free will, the praise of the saints,&#8212;I think it is more convenient to make a general discrimination of all that they maintain, the contrary of which they object to us, and to show which of those things pertain to any of those five, that so my answer may be by that very distinction clearer and briefer.</p>
