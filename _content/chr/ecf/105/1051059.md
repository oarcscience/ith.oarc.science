id="xxi.ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[XII.\]—Remarkable
Illustrations of Grace and Predestination in Infants, and in
Christ.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxiii-p2"></span>But all this reasoning, whereby we
maintain that the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord is truly
grace, that is, is not given according to our merits, although it is
most manifestly asserted by the witness of the divine declarations, yet,
among those who think that they are withheld from all zeal for piety
unless they can attribute to themselves something, which they first give
that it may be recompensed to them again, involves somewhat of a
difficulty in respect of the condition of grown-up people, who are
already exercising the choice of will. But when we come to the case of
infants, and to the Mediator between God and man Himself, the man Christ
Jesus, there is wanting all assertion of human merits that precede the
grace of God, because the former are not distinguished from others by
any preceding good merits that they should belong to the Deliverer of
men; any more than He Himself being Himself a man, was made the
Deliverer of men by virtue of any precedent human merits.
