<span id="xxi.iii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[IV.\]—The Fourth
Petition.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.ix-p2"></span>The fourth petition is, “Give us this
day our daily bread,” <span id="fr_3569"></span>[3570](#fn_3569) where
the blessed Cyprian shows how here also perseverance is understood to be
asked for. Because he says, among other things, “And we ask that this
bread should be given to us daily, that we who are in Christ, and daily
receive the Eucharist for the food of salvation, may not by the
interposition of some heinous sin be separated from Christ’s body by
being withheld from communicating and prevented from partaking of the
heavenly bread.” <span id="fr_3570"></span>[3571](#fn_3570) These words
of the holy man of God indicate that the saints ask for perseverance
directly from God, when with this intention they say, “Give us this day
our daily bread,” that they may not be separated from Christ’s body, but
may continue in that holiness in which they allow no crime by which they
may deserve to be separated from it.
