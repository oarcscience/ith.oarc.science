<span id="x.iv.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 45 \[XXVIII.\]—The Law of Sin is
Called Sin; How Concupiscence Still Remains After Its Evil Has Been
Removed in the Baptized.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xlv-p2"></span>This law of sin, however, which the
apostle also designates “sin,” when he says, “Let not *sin* therefore
reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts
thereof,” <span id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614) does not so remain in
the members of those who are born again of water and the Spirit, as if
no remission thereof has been made, because there is a full and perfect
remission of our sins, all the enmity being slain, which separated us
from God; but it remains in our old carnal nature, as if overcome and
destroyed, if it does not, by consenting to unlawful objects, somehow
revive, and recover its own reign and dominion. There is, however, so
clear a distinction to be seen between this old carnal nature, in which
the law of sin, or sin, is already repealed, and that life of the
Spirit, in the newness of which they who are baptized are through God’s
grace born again, that the apostle deemed it too little to say of such
that they were not in sin; unless he also said that they were not in the
flesh itself, even before they departed out of this mortal life. “They
that are in the flesh,” says he, “cannot please God; but ye *are not in
the flesh*, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in
you.” <span id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615) And indeed, as they turn
to good account the flesh itself, however corruptible it be, who apply
its members to good works, and no longer are in that flesh, since they
do not mould their understanding nor their life according to its
principles; and as they in like manner make even a good use of death,
which is the penalty of the first sin, who encounter it with fortitude
and patience for their brethren’s sake, and for the faith, and in
defence of whatever is true and holy and just,—so also do all “true
yokefellows” in the faith turn to good account that very law of sin
which still remains, though remitted, in their old <span id="page_63">p.
63</span> <span id="x.iv.xlv-Page_63"></span>carnal nature, who, because
they have the new life in Christ, do not permit lust to have dominion
over them. And yet these very persons, because they still carry about
Adam’s old nature, mortally generate children to be immortally
regenerated, with that propagation of sin, in which such as are born
again are not held bound, and from which such as are born are released
by being born again. As long, then, as the law by concupiscence <span
id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616) dwells in the members, although it
remains, the guilt of it is released; but it is released only to him who
has received the sacrament of regeneration, and has already begun to be
renewed. But whatsoever is born of the old nature, which still abides
with its concupiscence, requires to be born again in order to be healed.
Seeing that believing parents, who have been both carnally born and
spiritually born again, have themselves begotten children in a carnal
manner, how could their children by any possibility, previous to their
first birth, have been born again?
