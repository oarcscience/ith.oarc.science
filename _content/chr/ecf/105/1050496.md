<span id="xv.iii.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41.—Restoration of Nature Understood
by Pelagius as Forgiveness of Sins.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xli-p2"></span>In this same work he says in another
passage: “Now, if even without God men show of what character they have
been made by God, see what Christians have it in their power to do,
whose nature has been through Christ restored to a better condition, and
who are, moreover, assisted by the help of divine grace.” <span
id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882) By this restoration of nature to a
better state he would have us understand the remission of sins. This he
has shown with sufficient clearness in another passage of this epistle,
where he says: “Even those who have become in a certain sense obdurate
through their long practice of sinning, can be restored through
repentance.” <span id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883) But he may even
here too make the assistance of divine grace consist in the revelation
of teaching.
