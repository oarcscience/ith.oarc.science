<span id="xi.li-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter 48.—The Image of God is Not Wholly
Blotted Out in These Unbelievers; Venial Sins.</span>

<span id="xi.li-p2"></span>According to some, however, they who do by
nature the things contained in the law must not be regarded as yet in
the number of those whom Christ’s grace justifies, but rather as among
those some of whose actions (although they are those of ungodly men, who
do not truly and rightly worship the true God) we not only cannot blame,
but even justly and rightly praise, since they have been done—so far as
we read, or know, or hear—according to the rule of righteousness; though
at the same time, were we to discuss the question with what motive they
are done, they would hardly be found to be such as deserve the praise
and defence which are due to righteous conduct. \[XXVIII.\] Still, since
God’s image has not been so completely erased in the soul of man by the
stain of earthly affections, as to have left remaining there not even
the merest lineaments of it whence it might be justly said that man,
even in the ungodliness of his life, does, or appreciates, some things
contained in the law; if this is what is meant by the statement that
“the Gentiles, which have not the law” (that is, the law of God), “do by
nature the things contained in the law,” <span
id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953) and that men of this character “are a
law to themselves,” and “show the work of the law written in their
hearts,”—that is to say, what was impressed on their hearts when they
were created in the image of God has not been wholly blotted out:—even
in this view of the subject, that wide difference will not be disturbed,
which separates the new covenant from the old, and which lies in the
fact that by the new covenant the law of God is written in the hearts of
believers, whereas in the old it was inscribed on tables of stone. For
this writing in the heart is effected by renovation, although it had not
been completely blotted out by the old nature. For just as that image of
God is renewed in the mind of believers by the new testament, which
impiety had not quite abolished (for there had remained undoubtedly that
which the soul of man cannot be except it be rational), so also the law
of God, which had not been wholly blotted out there by unrighteousness,
is certainly written thereon, renewed by grace. Now in the Jews the law
which was written on tables could not effect this new inscription, which
is justification, but only transgression. For they too were men, and
there was inherent in them that power of nature, which enables the
rational soul both to perceive and do what is lawful; but the godliness
which transfers to another life happy and immortal has “a spotless law,
converting souls,” <span id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954) so that by
the light thereof they may be renewed, and that be accomplished in them
which is written, “There has been manifested over us, O Lord, the light
of Thy countenance.” <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955) Turned away
from which, they have deserved to grow old, whilst they are incapable of
renovation except by the grace of Christ,—in other words, without the
intercession of the Mediator; there being “one God and one Mediator
between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself <span
id="page_104">p. 104</span> <span id="xi.li-Page_104"></span>a ransom
for all.” <span id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956) Should those be
strangers to His grace of whom we are treating, and who (after the
manner of which we have spoken with sufficient fulness already) “do by
nature the things contained in the law,” <span
id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957) of what use will be their “excusing
thoughts” to them “in the day when God shall judge the secrets of
men,” <span id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958) unless it be perhaps to
procure for them a milder punishment? For as, on the one hand, there are
certain venial sins which do not hinder the righteous man from the
attainment of eternal life, and which are unavoidable in this life, so,
on the other hand, there are some good works which are of no avail to an
ungodly man towards the attainment of everlasting life, although it
would be very difficult to find the life of any very bad man whatever
entirely without them. But inasmuch as in the kingdom of God the saints
differ in glory as one star does from another, <span
id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959) so likewise, in the condemnation of
everlasting punishment, it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for
that other city; <span id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960) whilst some men
will be twofold more the children of hell than others. <span
id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961) Thus in the judgment of God not even
this fact will be without its influence,—that one man will have sinned
more, or less, than another, even when both are involved in the
ungodliness that is worthy of damnation.
