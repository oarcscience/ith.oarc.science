<span id="xx.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 \[VI\]—Why They May Justly Be Rebuked
Who Do Not Obey God, Although They Have Not Yet Received the Grace of
Obedience.</span>

<span id="xx.xii-p2"></span>“The apostle says,” say they, “‘For who
maketh thee to differ? And what hast thou that thou hast not received?
Now also if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst
not received it?’ <span id="fr_3264"></span>[3265](#fn_3264) Why, then,
are we rebuked, censured, reproved, accused? What do we do, we who have
not received?” They who say this wish to appear without blame in respect
of their not obeying God, because assuredly obedience itself is His
gift; and that gift must of necessity be in him in whom dwells love,
which without doubt is of God, <span
id="fr_3265"></span>[3266](#fn_3265) and the Father gives it to His
children. “This,” say they, “we have not received. Why, then, are we
rebuked, as if we were able to give it to ourselves, and of our own
choice would not give it?” And they do not observe that, if they are not
yet regenerated, the first reason why, when they are reproached because
they are disobedient to God, they ought to be dissatisfied with
themselves is, that God made man upright from the beginning of the human
creation,  <span id="fr_3266"></span>[3267](#fn_3266) and there is no
unrighteousness with God. <span id="fr_3267"></span>[3268](#fn_3267) And
thus the first depravity, whereby God is not obeyed, is of man, <span
id="page_475">p. 475</span> <span id="xx.xii-Page_475"></span>because,
falling by his own evil will from the rectitude in which God at first
made him, he became depraved. Is, then, that depravity not to be rebuked
in a man because it is not peculiar to him who is rebuked, but is common
to all? Nay, let that also be rebuked in individuals, which is common to
all. For the circumstance that none is altogether free from it is no
reason why it should not attach to each man. Those original sins,
indeed, are said to be the sins of others, because individuals derived
them from their parents; but they are not unreasonably said to be our
own also, because in that one, as the apostle says, all have
sinned. <span id="fr_3268"></span>[3269](#fn_3268) Let, then, the
damnable source be rebuked, that from the mortification of rebuke may
spring the will of regeneration,—if, indeed, he who is rebuked is a
child of promise,—in order that, by the noise of the rebuke sounding and
lashing from without, God may by His hidden inspiration work in him from
within to will also. If, however, being already regenerate and
justified, he relapses of his own will into an evil life, assuredly he
cannot say, “I have not received,” because of his own free choice to
evil he has lost the grace of God, that he had received. And if, stung
with compunction by rebuke, he wholesomely bewails, and returns to
similar good works, or even better, certainly here most manifestly
appears the advantage of rebuke. But yet for rebuke by the agency of man
to avail, whether it be of love or not, depends only upon God.
