<p><a name="xi.viii-p2"></A>We, however, on our side affirm that the human will is so divinely aided in the pursuit of righteousness, that (in addition to man&#146;s being created with a free-will, and in addition to the teaching by which he is instructed how he ought to live) he receives the Holy Ghost, by whom there is formed in his mind a delight in, and a love of, that supreme and unchangeable good which is God, even now while he is still &#8220;walking by faith&#8221; and not yet &#8220;by sight;&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_719"></A><A HREF="#fn_719"><FONT SIZE="1">720</FONT></A>
 in order that by this gift to him of the earnest, as it were, of the free gift, he may conceive an ardent desire to cleave to his Maker, and may burn to enter upon the participation in that true light, that it may go well with him from Him to whom he owes his existence. A man&#146;s free-will, indeed, avails for nothing except to sin, if he <A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A> <a name="xi.viii-Page_85"></A>knows not the way of truth; and even after his duty and his proper aim shall begin to become known to him, unless he also take delight in and feel a love for it, he neither does his duty, nor sets about it, nor lives rightly. Now, in order that such a course may engage our affections, God&#146;s &#8220;love is shed abroad in our hearts,&#8221; not through the free-will which arises from ourselves, but &#8220;through the Holy Ghost, which is given to us.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_720"></A><A HREF="#fn_720"><FONT SIZE="1">721</FONT></A>
