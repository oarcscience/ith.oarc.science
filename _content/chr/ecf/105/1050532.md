<span id="xv.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[XIX.\]—Pelagius Avoids the
Question as to Why Baptism is Necessary for Infants.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxi-p2"></span>Now it is to no purpose that he says all
this. He does not clear himself thereby. Not even they have ever denied
the impossibility of infants entering the kingdom of heaven without
baptism. But this is not the question; what we are discussing concerns
the obliteration <span id="fr_1944"></span>[1945](#fn_1944) of original
sin in infants. Let him clear himself on this point, since he refuses to
acknowledge that there is anything in infants which the laver of
regeneration has to cleanse. On this account we ought carefully to
consider what he has afterwards to say. After adducing, then, the
passage of the Gospel which declares that “whosoever is not born again
of water and the Spirit cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven” <span
id="fr_1945"></span>[1946](#fn_1945) (on which matter, as we have said,
they raise no question), he goes on at once to ask: “Who indeed is so
impious as to have the heart to refuse the common redemption of the
human race to an infant of any age whatever?” But this is ambiguous
language; for what *redemption* does he mean? Is it from evil to good?
or from good to better? Now even Cœlestius, at Carthage, <span
id="fr_1946"></span>[1947](#fn_1946) allowed a redemption for infants in
his book; although, at the same time, he would not admit the
transmission of sin to them from Adam.
