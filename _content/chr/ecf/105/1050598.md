<span id="xvi.v.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33 \[XXX.\]—True Freedom Comes
with Willing Delight in God’s Law.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxxiii-p2"></span>The apostle then repeats his former
statement, the more fully to recommend its purport: “For the good,” says
he, “that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that
dwelleth in me.” Then follows this: “I find then the law, when I would
act, to be good to me; for evil is present with me.” <span
id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170) In other words, I find that the law
is a good to me, when I wish to do what the law would have me do;
inasmuch as it is not with the law itself (which says, “Thou shalt not
covet”) that evil is present; no, it is with myself that the evil is
present, which I would not do, because I have the concupiscence even in
my willingness. “For,” he adds, “I delight in the law of God after the
inward man; but I see another law in my members warring against the law
of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in
my members.” <span id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171) This delight
with the law of God <span id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172) after the
inward man, comes to us from the mighty grace of God; for thereby is our
inward man renewed day by day, <span
id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173) because it is thereby that progress
is made by us with perseverance. In it there is not the fear that has
torment, but the love that cheers and gratifies. We are truly free
there, where we have no unwilling joy.
