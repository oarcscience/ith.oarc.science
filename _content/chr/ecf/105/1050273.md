id="xii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26 \[XXIV.\]—Christ Died of His Own
Power and Choice.</span>

<span id="xii.xxx-p2"></span>As to his statement, indeed, that “the Lord
was able to die without sin;” His being born also was of the ability of
His mercy, not the demand of His nature: so, likewise, did He undergo
death of His own power; and this is our price which He paid to redeem us
from death. Now, this truth their contention labours hard to make of
none effect; for human nature is maintained by them to be such, that
with free will it wants no such ransom in order to be translated from
the power of darkness and of him who has the power of death, <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194) into the kingdom of Christ the
Lord. <span id="fr_1195"></span>[1196](#fn_1195) And yet, when the Lord
drew near His passion, He said, “Behold, the prince of this world cometh
and shall find nothing in me,” <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[1197](#fn_1196) —and therefore no sin, of course,
on account of which he might exercise dominion over Him, so as to
destroy Him. “But,” added He, “that the world may know that I do the
will of my Father, arise, let us go hence;” <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1198](#fn_1197) as much as to say, I am going to
die, not through the necessity of sin, but in voluntariness of
obedience.
