<span id="x.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 15.—Carnal Generation Condemned on
Account of Original Sin.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xv-p2"></span>He sets forth that this absolute weakness,
or rather condemnation, of carnal generation is from the transgression
of original sin, when, treating of his own sins, he shows, as it were,
their causes, and says that “man that is born of a woman hath but a
short time to live, and is full of wrath.” Of what wrath, but of that in
which all are, as the apostle says, “by nature,” that is, by origin,
“children of wrath,” <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517) inasmuch as
they are children of the concupiscence of the flesh and of the world? He
further shows that to this same wrath also pertains the death of man.
For after saying, “He hath but a short time to live, and is full of
wrath,” he added, “Like a flower that hath bloomed, so doth he fall; he
is gone like a shadow, and continueth not.” He then subjoins: “Hast Thou
not caused him to enter into judgment with Thee? For who is pure from
uncleanness? Not even one; even should his life last but a day.” In
these words he in fact says, Thou hast thrown upon man, short-lived
though he be, the care of entering into judgment with Thee. For how
brief soever be his life,—even if it last but a single day,—he could not
possibly be clean of filth; and therefore with perfect justice must he
come under Thy judgment. Then, when he says again, “Thou hast numbered
all my necessities, and not one of my sins hath escaped Thee: Thou hast
sealed up my transgressions in a bag, and hast marked whatever I have
done unwillingly;” is it not clear enough that even those sins are
justly imputed which are not committed through allurement of pleasure,
but for the sake of avoiding some trouble, or pain, or death? Now these
sins, too, are said to be committed under some necessity, whereas they
ought all to be overcome by the love and pleasure of righteousness.
Again, what he said in the clause, “Thou hast marked whatever I have
done unwillingly,” may evidently be connected with the saying: “For what
I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that do I.” <span
