<span id="x.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24 \[XIX.\]—Infants Saved as
Sinners.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxiv-p2"></span>And let no one suppose that infants
ought to be brought to baptism, on the ground that, as they are not
sinners, so they are not righteous; how then do some remind us that the
Lord commends this tender age as meritorious; saying, “Suffer the little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the
kingdom of heaven?” <span id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287) For if this
\[“of such”\] is not said because of likeness in humility (since
humility makes \[us\] children), but because of the laudable life of
children, then of course infants must be righteous persons; otherwise,
it could not be correctly said, “Of such is the kingdom of heaven,” for
heaven can only belong to the righteous. But perhaps, after all, it is
not a right opinion of the meaning of the Lord’s words, to make Him
commend the life of infants when He says, “Of such is the kingdom of
heaven;” inasmuch as *that* may be their true sense, which makes Christ
adduce the tender age of infancy as a likeness of humility. Even so,
however, perhaps we must revert to the tenet which I mentioned just now,
that infants ought to be baptized, because, although they are not
sinners, they are yet not righteous. But when He had said: “I came not
to call the righteous,” as if responding to this, Whom, then, didst Thou
come to call? immediately He goes on to say: “—but sinners to
repentance.” Therefore it follows, that, however righteous they may be,
if also they are not sinners, He came not to call them, who said of
Himself: “I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” They therefore
seem, not vainly only, but even wickedly to rush to the baptism of Him
who does not invite them,—an opinion which God forbid that we should
entertain. He calls them, then, as a Physician who is not needed for
those that are whole, but for those that are sick; and who came not to
call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. Now, inasmuch as infants
are not held bound by any sins of their own actual life, it is the guilt
of original sin which is healed in them by the grace of Him who saves
them by the laver of regeneration.
