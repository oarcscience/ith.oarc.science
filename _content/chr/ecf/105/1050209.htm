<p class="c46"><a name="xi.xxxvi-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xi.xxxvi-p1.1"></A>Chapter 33.&#8212;The Prophecy of Jeremiah Concerning the New Testament.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xi.xxxvi-p2"></A>Observe this also in that testimony which was given by the prophet on this subject in the clearest way: &#8220;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will consummate a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. Because they continued not in my covenant, I also have rejected them, saith the Lord. But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_852"></A><A HREF="#fn_852"><FONT SIZE="1">853</FONT></A>
 What say we to this? One nowhere, or hardly anywhere, except in this passage of the prophet, finds in the Old Testament Scriptures any mention so made of the New Testament as to indicate it by its very name. It is no doubt often referred to and foretold as about to be given, but not so plainly as to have its very name mentioned. Consider then carefully, what difference God has testified as existing between the two testaments&#8212;the old covenant and the new.</p>
