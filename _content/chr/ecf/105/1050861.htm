<p class="c46"><a name="xviii.iv.xix-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xviii.iv.xix-p1.1"></A>Chapter 19 [IX.]&#8212;He Interprets the Scriptures Which the Pelagians Make Ill Use of.</span></p>  
<p><a name="xviii.iv.xix-p2"></A>But assuredly, as to what is written, &#8220;The preparation of the heart is man&#146;s part, and the answer of the tongue is from the Lord,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2657"></A><A HREF="#fn_2657"><FONT SIZE="1">2658</FONT></A>
 they are misled by an imperfect understanding, so as to think that to prepare the heart&#8212;that is, to begin good&#8212;pertains to man without the aid of God&#146;s grace. Be it far from the children of promise thus to understand it! As if, when they heard the Lord saying, &#8220;Without me ye can do nothing,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2658"></A><A HREF="#fn_2658"><FONT SIZE="1">2659</FONT></A>
 they would convict Him by saying, &#8220;Behold without Thee we can prepare the heart;&#8221; or when they heard from Paul the apostle, &#8220;Not that we are sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2659"></A><A HREF="#fn_2659"><FONT SIZE="1">2660</FONT></A>
 as if they would also convict him, saying, &#8220;Behold, we are sufficient of ourselves to prepare our heart, and thus also to think some good thing; for who can without good thought prepare his heart for good?&#8221; Be it far from any thus to understand the passage, except the proud maintainers of free will and forsakers of the catholic faith! Therefore, since it is written, &#8220;It is man&#146;s part to prepare the heart, and the answer of the tongue is from the Lord,&#8221; it is that man prepares his heart, not, however, without the aid of God, who so touches the heart that man prepares the heart. But in the answer of the tongue&#8212;that is, in that which the divine tongue answers to the prepared heart&#8212;man has no part; but the whole is from the Lord God.</p>
