<p><a name="x.iii.xv-p2"></A>But observe more attentively what he says, that &#8220;through the offence of one, many are dead.&#8221; For why should it be on account of the sin of one, and not rather on account of their own sins, if this passage is to be understood of <i>imitation</i>, and not of <i>propagation?</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">258</FONT></A>
 But mark what follows: &#8220;And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the grace is of many offences unto justification.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">259</FONT></A>
 Now let them tell us, where there is room in these words for <i>imitation</i>. &#8220;By one,&#8221; says he, &#8220;to condemnation.&#8221; By one what except one sin? This, indeed, he clearly implies in the words which he adds: &#8220;But the grace is of many offences unto justification.&#8221; Why, indeed, is the judgment from one offence to condemnation, while the grace is from many offences to justification? If original sin is a nullity, would it not follow, that not only grace withdraws men from many offences to justification, but judgment leads them to condemnation from many offences likewise? For assuredly grace does not condone many offences, without judgment in like manner having many offences to condemn. Else, if men are involved in condemnation because of one offence, on the ground that all the offences which are condemned were committed in imitation of that one offence; there is the same reason why men should also be regarded as withdrawn from one offence unto justification, inasmuch as all the offences which are remitted to the justified were committed in imitation of that one offence. But this most certainly was not the apostle&#146;s meaning, when he said: &#8220;The judgment, indeed, was from <i>one</i> offence unto condemnation, but the grace was from <i>many</i> offences unto justification.&#8221; We on our side, indeed, can understand the apostle, and see that judgment is predicated of one offence unto condemnation entirely on the ground that, even if there were in men nothing but original sin, it would be sufficient for their condemnation. For however much heavier will be their condemnation who have added their own sins to <A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A> <a name="x.iii.xv-Page_21"></A>the original offence (and it will be the more severe in individual cases, in proportion to the sins of individuals); still, even that sin alone which was originally derived unto men not only excludes from the kingdom of God, which infants are unable to enter (as they themselves allow), unless they have received the grace of Christ before they die, but also alienates from salvation and everlasting life, which cannot be anything else than the kingdom of God, to which fellowship with Christ alone introduces us.</p>
