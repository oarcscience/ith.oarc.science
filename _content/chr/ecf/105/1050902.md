<span id="xviii.vi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 \[V.\]—Of the Praise of
Marriage.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.ix-p2"></span>But further, concerning the praise of
marriage, <span id="fr_2790"></span>[2791](#fn_2790) what advantage is
it to them that, in opposition to the Manicheans, who assign marriage
not to the true and good God, but to the prince of darkness, these men
resist the words of true piety, and say, “That the Lord speaks in the
gospel, saying, Who from the beginning made them male and female, and
said, Increase and multiply and replenish the earth. What therefore God
hath joined together, let not man put asunder”? <span
id="fr_2791"></span>[2792](#fn_2791) What does this profit them, by
means of the truth to seduce to a falsehood? For they say this in order
that infants may be thought to be born free from all fault, and thus
that there is no need of their being reconciled to God through Christ,
since they have no original sin, on account of which reconciliation is
necessary to all by means of one who came into the world without sin,
just as the enmities of all were caused by means of one through whom sin
entered into the world. And this is believed by catholics for the sake
of the salvation of the nature of men, without detracting from the
praise of marriage; because the praise of marriage is a righteous
intercourse of the sexes, not a wicked defence of vices. And thus, when,
by their praise of marriage, these persons wish to draw over men from
the Manicheans to themselves, they desire merely to change their
disease, not to heal it.
