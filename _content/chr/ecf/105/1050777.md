<span id="xvii.vii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[XV.\]—Recognition and Form
Belong to Souls as Well as Bodies.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxi-p2"></span>But you say: “If the soul is
incorporeal, what was it that the rich man saw in hell? He certainly
recognised Lazarus; he did \[not <span
id="fr_2484"></span>[2485](#fn_2484) \] know Abraham. Whence arose to
him the knowledge of Abraham, who had died so long before?” By using
these words, I suppose that you do not think a man can be recognised and
known without his bodily form. To know yourself, therefore, I imagine
that you often stand before your looking-glass, lest by forgetting your
features you should be unable to recognise yourself. But let me ask you,
what man does anybody know more than himself; and whose face can he see
less than his own? But who could possibly know God, whom even you do not
doubt to be incorporeal, if knowledge could not (as you suppose) accrue
without bodily shape; that is, if bodies alone can be recognised? What
Christian, however, when discussing subjects of such magnitude and
difficulty, can give such little heed to the inspired word as to say,
“If the soul be incorporeal, it must of necessity lack form”? Have you
forgotten that in that word you have read of “a form of doctrine”?
 <span id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485) Have you forgotten, too,
that it is written con<span id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span
id="xvii.vii.xxi-Page_364"></span>cerning Christ Jesus, previous to His
clothing Himself with humanity, that He was “in the form of God”? <span
id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486) How, then, can you say, “If the
soul is incorporeal, it must of necessity lack form;” when you hear of
“the form of God,” whom you acknowledge to be incorporeal; and so
express yourself, as if form could not possibly exist except in bodies?
