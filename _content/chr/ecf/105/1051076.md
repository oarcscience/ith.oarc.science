<span id="xxi.ii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40 \[XX.\]—Apostolic Testimony to the
Beginning of Faith Being God’s Gift.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xl-p2"></span>Moreover, we are admonished that the
beginning of men’s faith is God’s gift, since the apostle signifies this
when, in the Epistle to the Colossians, he says, “Continue in prayer,
and watch in the same in giving of thanks. Withal praying also for us
that God would open unto us the door of His word, to speak the mystery
of Christ, for which also I am in bonds, that I may so make it manifest
as I ought to speak.” <span id="fr_3539"></span>[3540](#fn_3539) How is
the door of His word opened, except when the sense of the hearer is
opened so that he may believe, and, having made a beginning of faith,
may admit those things which are declared and reasoned, for the purpose
of building up wholesome doctrine, lest, by a heart closed through
unbelief, he reject and repel those things which are spoken? Whence,
also, he says to the Corinthians: “But I will tarry at Ephesus until
Pentecost. For a great and evident door is <span id="page_518">p.
518</span> <span id="xxi.ii.xl-Page_518"></span>opened unto me, and
there are many adversaries.” <span id="fr_3540"></span>[3541](#fn_3540)
What else can be understood here, save that, when the gospel had been
first of all preached there by him, many had believed, and there had
appeared many adversaries of the same faith, in accordance with that
saying of the Lord, “No one cometh unto me, unless it were given him of
my Father;” <span id="fr_3541"></span>[3542](#fn_3541) and, “To you it
is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
is not given”? <span id="fr_3542"></span>[3543](#fn_3542) Therefore,
there is an open door in those to whom it is given, but there are many
adversaries among those to whom it is not given.
