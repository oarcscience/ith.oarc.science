<p class="c46"><a name="xv.iii.xvii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xv.iii.xvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 17 [XVI.]&#8212;Does Pelagius Designedly Refrain from Openly Saying that All Good Action is from God?</span></p>  
<p><a name="xv.iii.xvii-p2"></A>&#8220;That we are able to speak,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is of God; but that we make a good or a bad use of speech is of ourselves.&#8221; He, however, who has made the most excellent use of speech does not teach us so. &#8220;For,&#8221; says He, &#8220;it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1823"></A><A HREF="#fn_1823"><FONT SIZE="1">1824</FONT></A>
 &#8220;So, again,&#8221; adds Pelagius, &#8220;that I may, by applying a general case in illustration, embrace all,&#8212;that we are able to do, say, think, any good thing, comes from Him who has endowed us with this ability, and who also assists it.&#8221; Observe how even here he repeats his former meaning &#8212;that of these three, capacity, volition, action, it is only the capacity which receives help. Then, by way of completely stating what he intends to say, he adds: &#8220;But that we really do a good thing, or speak a good word, or think a good thought, proceeds from our own selves.&#8221; He forgot what he had before&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1824"></A><A HREF="#fn_1824"><FONT SIZE="1">1825</FONT></A>
 said by way of correcting, as it were, his own words; for after saying, &#8220;Man is to be praised therefore for his willing and doing a good work,&#8221; he at once goes on to modify his statement thus: &#8220;Or rather, this praise belongs both to man, and to God who has given him the capacity of this very will and work.&#8221; Now what is the reason why he did not remember this admission when giving his examples, so as to say this much at least after quoting them: &#8220;That we are able to do, say, think any good thing, comes from Him who has given us this ability, and who also assists it. That, however, we really do a good thing, or speak a good word, or think a good thought, proceeds <i>both from ourselves and from Him!</i>&#8221; This, however, he has not said. But, if I am not mistaken, I think I see why he was afraid to do so.</p>
