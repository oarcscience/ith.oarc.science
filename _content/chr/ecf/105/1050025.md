<span id="x.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[VII.\]—The Life of the Body the
Object of Hope, the Life of the Spirit Being a Prelude to It.</span>

<span id="x.iii.vii-p2"></span>Although I am much afraid that so clear a
matter may rather be obscured by exposition, I must yet request your
attention to the luminous statement of the apostle. “But if Christ,”
says he, “be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the
spirit is life because of righteousness.” <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228) Now this is said, that men may not
suppose that they derive no benefit, or but scant benefit, from the
grace of Christ, seeing that they must needs die in the body. For they
are bound to remember that, although their body still bears that desert
of sin, which is irrevocably bound to the condition of death, yet their
spirit has already begun to live because of the righteousness of faith,
although it had actually become extinct by the death, as it were, of
unbelief. No small gift, therefore, he says, must you suppose to have
been conferred <span id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span
id="x.iii.vii-Page_18"></span>upon you, by the circumstance that Christ
is in you; inasmuch as in the body, which is dead because of sin, your
spirit is even now alive because of righteousness; so that therefore you
should not despair of the life even of your body. “For if the Spirit of
Him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up
Christ from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies by His Spirit
that dwelleth in you.” <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229) How is it
that fumes of controversy still darken so clear a light? The apostle
distinctly tells you, that although the body is dead because of sin
within you, yet even your mortal bodies shall be made alive because of
righteousness, because of which even now your spirit is life,—the whole
of which process is to be perfected by the grace of Christ, that is, by
His Spirit dwelling in you: and men still contradict! He goes on to tell
us how it comes to pass that life converts death into itself by
mortifying it. “Therefore, brethren,” says he, “we are debtors, not to
the flesh, to live after the flesh; for if ye live after the flesh, ye
shall die; but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the
flesh, ye shall live.” <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230) What else
does this mean but this: If ye live according to death, ye shall wholly
die; but if by living according to life ye mortify death, ye shall
wholly live?
