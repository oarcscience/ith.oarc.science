<span id="xvi.vi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[III.\]—Augustin Adduces a
Passage Selected from the Preface of Julianus. (See “The Unfinished
Work,” i. 73.)</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.viii-p2"></span>Let us now look at those words of ours
which he adduced just as it suited him, and to which he would oppose his
own. For they are followed by his words; moreover, as the person
insinuated who sent you the paper of extracts, he copied something out
of a preface, which was no doubt the preface of the books from which he
selected a few passages. The paragraph thus copied stands as follows:
“The teachers of our day, most holy brother, <span
id="fr_2201"></span>[2202](#fn_2201) who are the instigators of the
disgraceful faction which is now overheated with its zeal, are
determined on compassing the injury and discredit of the men with whose
sacred fervour they are set on fire, by nothing less than the ruin of
the whole Church; little thinking how much honour they have conferred on
those whose renown they have shown to be only capable of being destroyed
along with the catholic religion. For, if one should say, either that
there is free will in man, or that God is the Creator of those that are
born, <span id="fr_2202"></span>[2203](#fn_2202) he is at once set down
as a Cœlestian and a Pelagian. To avoid being called heretics, they turn
Manicheans; and so, whilst shirking a pretended infamy, they incur a
real reproach; just like the animals, which in hunting they surround
with dyed feathers, in order to scare and drive them into their
nets; <span id="fr_2203"></span>[2204](#fn_2203) the poor brutes are not
gifted with reason, and so they are thrust all together by a vain panic
into a real destruction.” <span id="fr_2204"></span>[2205](#fn_2204)

<span id="xvi.vi.viii-p3"></span> He calls Florus “most holy father”
elsewhere (see *The Unfinished Work*, iv. 5). This man, to whom Julianus
dedicated his work, is called a *colleague* or fellow-bishop of Julianus
by Augustin (*The Unfinished Work*, iii. 187).
