<span id="x.iv.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16—Job Foresaw that Christ Would Come
to Suffer; The Way of Humility in Those that are Perfect.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xvi-p2"></span>Now it is remarkable <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519) that the Lord Himself, after bestowing
on Job the testimony which is expressed in Scripture, that is, by the
Spirit of <span id="page_51">p. 51</span> <span
id="x.iv.xvi-Page_51"></span>God, “In all the things which happened to
him he sinned not with his lips before the Lord,” <span
id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520) did yet afterwards speak to him with a
rebuke, as Job himself tells us: “Why do I yet plead, being admonished,
and hearing the rebukes of the Lord?” <span
id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521) Now no man is justly rebuked unless
there be in him something which deserves rebuke. \[XI.\] And what sort
of rebuke is this,—which, moreover, is understood to proceed from the
person of Christ our Lord? He re-counts to him all the divine operations
of His power, rebuking him under this idea,—that He seems to say to him,
“Canst thou effect all these mighty works as I can?” But to what purpose
is all this but that Job might understand (for this instruction was
divinely inspired into him, that he might foreknow Christ’s coming to
suffer),—that he might understand how patiently he ought to endure all
that he went through, since Christ, although, when He became man for us,
He was absolutely without sin, and although as God He possessed so great
power, did for all that by no means refuse to obey even to the suffering
of death? When Job understood this with a purer intensity of heart, he
added to his own answer these words: “I used before now to hear of Thee
by the hearing of the ear; but behold now mine eye seeth Thee: therefore
I abhor myself and melt away, and account myself but dust and
ashes.” <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522) Why was he thus so
deeply displeased with himself? God’s work, in that he was man, could
not rightly have given him displeasure, since it is even said to God
Himself, “Despise not Thou the work of Thine own hands.” <span
id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523) It was indeed in view of that
righteousness, in which he had discovered his own unrighteousness, <span
id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524) that he abhorred himself and melted
away, and deemed himself dust and ashes,—beholding, as he did in his
mind, the righteousness of Christ, in whom there could not possibly be
any sin, not only in respect of His divinity, but also of His soul and
His flesh. It was also in view of this righteousness which is of God
that the Apostle Paul, although as “touching the righteousness which is
of the law he was blameless,” yet “counted all things” not only as loss,
but even as dung.  <span id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525)
