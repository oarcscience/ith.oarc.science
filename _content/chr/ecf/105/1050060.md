<span id="x.iii.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42.—From the First Epistle of
John.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xlii-p2"></span>Moreover, from John’s Epistle I meet
with the following words, which seem indispensable to the solution of
this question: “But if,” says he, “we walk in the light, as He is in the
light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus
Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.” <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345) To the like import he says, in another
place: “If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater:
for this is the witness of God, which is greater because He hath
testified of His Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the
witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar;
because he believed not in the testimony that God testified of His Son.
And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life; and
this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that
hath not the Son of God hath not life.” <span
id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346) It seems, then, that it is not only
the kingdom of heaven, but life also, which infants are not to have, if
they have not the Son, whom they can only have by His baptism. So again
he says: “For this cause the Son of God was manifested, that He might
destroy the works of the devil.” <span id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347)
Therefore infants will have no interest in the manifestation of the Son
of God, if He do not in them destroy the works of the devil.
