<span id="xvi.vi.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35 \[XX.\]—He Answers the
Arguments of Julianus. What is the Natural Use of the Woman? What is the
Unnatural Use?</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxxvi-p2"></span>My answer to this challenge is, that
not only the children of wedlock, but also those of adultery, are a good
work in so far as they are the work of God, by whom they are created:
but as concerns original sin, they are all born under condemnation of
the first Adam; not only those who are born in adultery, but likewise
such as are born in wedlock, unless they be regenerated in the second
Adam, which is Christ. As to what the apostle says of the wicked, that
“leaving the natural use of the woman, the men burned in their lust one
toward another: men with men working that which is unseemly;” <span
id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275) he did not speak of the conjugal
use, but the “natural use,” wishing us to understand how it comes to
pass that by means of the members created for the purpose the two sexes
can combine for generation. Thus it follows, that even when a man unites
with a harlot to use these members, the use is a natural one. It is not,
however, commendable, but rather culpable. But as regards any part of
the body which is not meant for generative purposes, should a man use
even his own wife in it, it is against nature and flagitious. Indeed,
the same apostle had previously <span
id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276) said concerning women: “Even their
women did change the natural use into that which is against nature;” and
then concerning men he added, that they worked that which is unseemly by
leaving the natural use of the woman. Therefore, by the phrase in
question, “the natural use,” it is not meant to praise conjugal
connection; but thereby are denoted those flagitious deeds which are
more unclean and criminal than even men’s use of women, which, even if
unlawful, is nevertheless natural.
