<span id="xv.iii.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 54 \[XLIX.\]—Ambrose Teaches that No
One is Sinless in This World.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.liv-p2"></span>Lastly, let him give good heed to his
venerable bishop, when he is expounding the Prophet Isaiah, <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919) and says that “no man in this world
can be without sin.” Now nobody can pretend to say that by the phrase
“*in this world*” he simply meant, in the love of this world. For he was
speaking of the apostle, who said, “Our conversation is in
heaven;” <span id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920) and while unfolding
the sense of these words, the eminent bishop expressed himself thus:
“Now the apostle says that many men, even while living in the present
world, are perfect with themselves, who could not possibly be deemed
perfect, if one looks at true perfection. For he says himself: ‘We now
see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part;
but then shall I know, even as also I am known.’ <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921) Thus, there are those who are
spotless in this world, there are those who will be spotless in the
kingdom of God; although, of course, if you sift the thing minutely, no
one could be spotless, because no one is without sin.” That passage,
then, of the holy Ambrose, which Pelagius applies in support of his own
opinion, was either written in a qualified sense, probable, indeed, but
not expressed with minute accuracy; or if the holy and lowly-minded
author did think that Zacharias and Elisabeth lived according to the
highest and abso<span id="page_235">p. 235</span> <span
id="xv.iii.liv-Page_235"></span>lutely perfect righteousness, which was
incapable of increase or addition, he certainly corrected his opinion on
a minuter examination of it.
