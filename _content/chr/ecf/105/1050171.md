id="x.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22 \[XIII.\]—We Ought to Be Anxious to
Secure the Baptism of Infants.</span>

<span id="x.v.xxii-p2"></span>For this is the point aimed at by the
controversy, against the novelty of which we have to struggle by the aid
of ancient truth: that it is clearly altogether superfluous for infants
to be baptized. Not that this opinion is avowed in so many words, lest
so firmly established a custom of the Church should be unable to endure
its assailants. But if we are taught to render help to orphans, how much
more ought we to labour in behalf of those children who, though under
the protection of parents, will still be left more destitute and
wretched than orphans, should that grace of Christ be denied them, which
they are all unable to demand for themselves?
