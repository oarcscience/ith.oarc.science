<p><a name="xxi.iii.lix-p2"></A>And yet this doctrine must not be preached to congregations in such a way as to seem to an unskilled multitude, or a people of slower understanding, to be in some measure confuted by that very preaching of it. Just as even the foreknowledge of God, which certainly men cannot deny, seems to be refuted if it be said to them, &#8220;Whether you run or sleep, you shall be that which He who cannot be deceived has foreknown you to be.&#8221; And it is the part of a deceitful or an unskilled physician so to compound even a useful medicament, that it either does no good or does harm. But it must be said, &#8220;So run that you may lay hold;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3698"></A><A HREF="#fn_3698"><FONT SIZE="1">3699</FONT></A>
 and thus by your very running you may know yourselves to be foreknown as those who should run lawfully:&#8221; and in whatever other manner the foreknowledge of God may be so preached, that the slothfulness of man may be repulsed.</p>
