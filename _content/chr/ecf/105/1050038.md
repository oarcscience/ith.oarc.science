<span id="x.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Original Sin Alone is Contracted
by Natural Birth.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xx-p2"></span>“Moreover the law entered, that the
offence might abound.” <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270) This
addition to original sin men now made of their own wilfulness, not
through Adam; but even this is done away and remedied by Christ, because
“where sin abounded, grace did much more abound; that as sin hath
reigned unto death” <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271) —even that
sin which men have not derived from Adam, but have added of their own
will—“even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal
life.” <span id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272) There is, however, other
righteousness apart from Christ, as there are other sins apart from
Adam. Therefore, after saying, “As sin hath reigned unto death,” he did
not add in the same clause “*by one*,” or “*by Adam*,” because he had
already spoken of that sin which was abounding when the law entered, and
which, of course, was not original sin, but the sin of man’s own wilful
commission. But after he has said: “Even so might grace also reign
through righteousness unto eternal life,” he at once adds, “through
Jesus Christ our Lord;” <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273) because,
whilst by the generation of the flesh only that sin is contracted which
is original; yet by the regeneration of the Spirit there is effected the
remission not of original sin only, but also of the sins of man’s own
voluntary and actual commission.
