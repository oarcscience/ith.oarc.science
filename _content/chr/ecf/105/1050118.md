Pelagians.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxix-p2"></span>Now, with reference to the passage of the
apostle which I have quoted, some would maintain it to mean that
“whatever amount of good will a man has, must be attributed to God on
this account,—namely, because even this amount could not be in him if he
were not a human being. Now, inasmuch as he has from God alone the
capacity of being any thing at all, and of being human, why should there
not be also attributed to God whatever there is in him of a good will,
which could not exist unless he existed in whom it is?” But in this same
manner it may also be said that a bad will also may be attributed to God
as its author; because even it could not exist in man unless he were a
man in whom it existed; but God is the author of his existence as man;
and thus also of his bad will, which could have no existence if it had
not a man in whom it might exist. But to argue thus is blasphemy.
