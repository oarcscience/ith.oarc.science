<span id="xx.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—The First Man Himself Also Might
Have Stood by His Free Will.</span>

<span id="xx.xxxi-p2"></span>Thus also He made man with free will; and
although ignorant of his future fall, yet therefore happy, because he
thought it was in his own power both not to die and not to become
miserable. And if he had willed by his own free will to continue in this
state of uprightness and freedom from sin, assuredly without any
experience of death and of unhappiness he would have received by the
merit of that continuance the fulness of blessing with which the holy
angels also are blessed; that is, the impossibility of falling any more,
and the knowledge of this with absolute certainty. For even he himself
could not be blessed although in Paradise, nay, he would not be there,
where it would not become him to be miserable, if the foreknowledge of
his fall had made him wretched with the dread of such a disaster. But
because he forsook God of his free will, he experienced the just
judgment of God, that with his whole race, which being as yet all placed
in him had sinned with him, he should be condemned. For as mary of this
race as are delivered by God’s grace are certainly delivered from the
condemnation in which they are already held bound. Whence, even if none
should be delivered, no one could justly blame the judgment of God.
That, therefore, in comparison of those that perish *few*, but in their
absolute number *many*, are delivered, is effected by grace, <span
id="fr_3342"></span>[3343](#fn_3342) is effected freely: <span
id="fr_3343"></span>[3344](#fn_3343) thanks must be given, because it is
effected, so that no one may be lifted up as of his own deservings, but
that every mouth may be stopped, <span
id="fr_3344"></span>[3345](#fn_3344) and he that glorieth may glory in
the Lord. <span id="fr_3345"></span>[3346](#fn_3345)
