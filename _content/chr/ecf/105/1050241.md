<span id="xi.lxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 65.—In What Sense a Sinless
Righteousness in This Life Can Be Asserted.</span>

<span id="xi.lxviii-p2"></span>Forasmuch, however, as an inferior
righteousness may be said to be competent to this life, whereby the just
man lives by faith <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095) although
absent from the Lord, and, therefore, walking <span id="page_113">p.
113</span> <span id="xi.lxviii-Page_113"></span>by faith and not yet by
sight, <span id="fr_1096"></span>[1097](#fn_1096) —it may be without
absurdity said, no doubt, in respect of it, that it is free from sin;
for it ought not to be attributed to it as a fault, that it is not as
yet sufficient for so great a love to God as is due to the final,
complete, and perfect condition thereof. It is one thing to fail at
present in attaining to the fulness of love, and another thing to be
swayed by no lust. A man ought therefore to abstain from every unlawful
desire, although he loves God now far less than it is possible to love
Him when He becomes an object of sight; just as in matters connected
with the bodily senses, the eye can receive no pleasure from any kind of
darkness, although it may be unable to look with a firm sight amidst
refulgent light. Only let us see to it that we so constitute the soul of
man in this corruptible body, that, although it has not yet swallowed up
and consumed the motions of earthly lust in that super-eminent
perfection of the love of God, it nevertheless, in that inferior
righteousness to which we have referred, gives no consent to the
aforesaid lust for the purpose of effecting any unlawful thing. In
respect, therefore, of that immortal life, the commandment is even now
applicable: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy might;” <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[1098](#fn_1097) but in reference to the present
life the following: “Let not sin reign in your mortal body, that ye
should obey it in the lusts thereof.” <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098) To the one, again, belongs, “Thou
shalt not covet;” <span id="fr_1099"></span>[1100](#fn_1099) to the
other, “Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.” <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[1101](#fn_1100) To the one it appertains to seek
for nothing more than to continue in its perfect state; to the other it
belongs actively to do the duty committed to it, and to hope as its
reward for the perfection of the future life,—so that in the one the
just man may live forevermore in the sight of that happiness which in
this life was his object of desire; in the other, he may live by that
faith whereon rests his desire for the ultimate blessedness as its
certain end. (These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives
by faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,—by committing not only
frightful deeds and crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend
an ear to a word that ought not to be listened to, or a tongue to a
phrase which should not be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought
in his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a
lawful one, although known to be unlawful by the commandment,—for this
amounts to a consent to sin, which would certainly be carried out in
act, unless fear of punishment deterred.) <span
id="fr_1101"></span>[1102](#fn_1101) Have such just men, while living by
faith, no need to say: “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
debtors?” <span id="fr_1102"></span>[1103](#fn_1102) And do they prove
this to be wrong which is written, “In Thy sight shall no man living be
justified?” <span id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103) and this: “If we
say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us?” <span id="fr_1104"></span>[1105](#fn_1104) and, “There is no man
that sinneth not;” <span id="fr_1105"></span>[1106](#fn_1105) and again,
“There is not on the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth
not” <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1107](#fn_1106) (for both these
statements are expressed in a general future sense,—“sinneth not,” “will
not sin,”—not in the past time, “has not sinned”)?—and all other places
of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture? Since, however, these
passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that
whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may
definitely ascribe to the present life, there is not a man living in it
who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it is necessary for every
one to give, that it may be given to him; <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[1108](#fn_1107) and to forgive, that it may be
forgiven him; <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108) and whatever
righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of himself, but from
the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and
thirsting for righteousness <span id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109)
from Him who is the living bread, <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110) and with whom is the fountain of
life; <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1112](#fn_1111) who works in His
saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life, their
justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart
to them liberally when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive
them when they confess.
