id="xvii.vii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24.—Abraham’s Bosom—What It
Means.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxiv-p2"></span>As to your supposing that “the
Abraham’s bosom referred to is corporeal,” and your further assertion,
that “by it is meant his whole body,” I fear that you must be regarded
(even in such a subject) as trying to joke and raise a laugh, instead of
acting gravely and seriously. For you could not else be so foolish as to
think that the material bosom of one person could receive so many souls;
nay, to use your own words, “bear the bodies of as many meritorious men
as the angels carry thither, as they did Lazarus.” Unless it happen to
be your opinion, that his soul alone deserved to find its way to the
said bosom. If you are not, then, in fun, and do not wish to make
childish mistakes, you must understand by “Abraham’s bosom” that remote
and separate abode of rest and peace in which Abraham now is; and that
what was said to Abraham <span id="fr_2492"></span>[2493](#fn_2492) did
not merely refer to him personally, but had reference to his appointment
as the father of many nations, <span
id="fr_2493"></span>[2494](#fn_2493) to whom he was presented for
imitation as the first and principal example of faith; even as God
willed Himself to be called “the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob,” although He is the God of an innumerable company.
