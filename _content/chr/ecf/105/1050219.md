<span id="xi.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43 \[XXVI.\]—A Question Touching the
Passage in the Apostle About the Gentiles Who are Said to Do by Nature
the Law’s Commands, Which They are Also Said to Have Written on Their
Hearts.</span>

<span id="xi.xlvi-p2"></span>Now we must see in what sense it is that
the apostle says, “For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by
nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a
law unto themselves, which show the work of the law written in their
hearts,” <span id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917) lest there should seem
to be no certain difference in the new testament, in that the Lord
promised that He would write His laws in the hearts of His people,
inasmuch as the Gentiles have this done for them naturally. This
question therefore has to be sifted, arising as it does as one of no
inconsiderable importance. For some one may say, “If God distinguishes
the new testament from the old by this circumstance, that in the old He
wrote His law on tables, but in the new He wrote them on men’s hearts,
by what are the faithful of the new testament discriminated from the
Gentiles, which have the work of the law written on their hearts,
whereby they do by nature the things of the law, <span
id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918) as if, forsooth, they were better than
the ancient people, which received the law on tables, and before the new
people, which has that conferred on it by the new testament which nature
has already bestowed on them?”
