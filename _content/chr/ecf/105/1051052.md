<span id="xxi.ii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16.—Why the Gift of Faith is Not
Given to All.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xvi-p2"></span>Faith, then, as well in its beginning as
in its completion, is God’s gift; and let no one have any doubt
whatever, unless he desires to resist the plainest sacred writings, that
this gift is given to some, while to some it is not given. But why it is
not given to all ought not to disturb the believer, who believes that
from one all have gone into a condemnation, which undoubtedly is most
righteous; so that even if none were delivered therefrom, there would be
no just cause for finding fault with God. Whence it is plain that it is
a great grace for many to be delivered, and to acknowledge in those that
are not delivered what would be due to themselves; so that he that
glorieth may glory not in his own merits, which he sees to be equalled
in those that are condemned, but in the Lord. But why He delivers one
rather than another,—“His judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past
finding out.” <span id="fr_3480"></span>[3481](#fn_3480) For it is
better in this case for us to hear or to say, “O man, who art thou that
repliest against God?” <span id="fr_3481"></span>[3482](#fn_3481) than
to dare to speak as if we could know what He has chosen to be kept
secret. Since, moreover, He could not will anything unrighteous.
