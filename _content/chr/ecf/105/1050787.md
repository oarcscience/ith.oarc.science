the Soul Distinguished.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxxi-p2"></span>Forasmuch, then, as there is one
function in the soul, by which we perceive real bodies, which we do by
the five bodily senses; another, which enables us to discern apart from
these non-corporeal likenesses of bodies (and by this we can have a view
of ourselves also, as not otherwise than like to bodies); and a third,
by which we gain a still surer and stronger insight into objects fitted
for its faculty, which are neither corporeal nor are like bodily
substances,—such as faith, hope, charity,—things which have neither
complexion, nor passion, nor any such thing: on which of these functions
ought we to dwell more intently, and to some degree more familiarly, and
where be renewed in the knowledge of God after the image of Him who
created us? Is it not on and in that which I have now put in the third
place? And here we shall certainly experience neither sexual difference
nor the semblance thereof.
