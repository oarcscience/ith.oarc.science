<p class="c36"><a name="xv.iv-p3"></A>Wherein Augustin shows that Pelagius really differs in no respect, on the question of original sin and the baptism of infants, from his follower C&#339;lestius, who, refusing to acknowledge original sin and even daring to deny the doctrine in public, was condemned in trials before the bishops&#8212;first at Carthage, and afterwards at Rome; for this question is not, as these heretics would have it, one wherein persons might err without danger to the faith. Their heresy, indeed, aimed at nothing else than the very foundations of Christian belief. He afterwards refutes all such as maintained that the blessing of matrimony is disparaged by the doctrine of original depravity, and an injury done to God himself, the Creator of man who is born by means of matrimony.</p>
