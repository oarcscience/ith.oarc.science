<p class="c46"><a name="xvi.vi.x-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xvi.vi.x-p1.1"></A>Chapter 9.&#8212;The Catholics Maintain the Doctrine of Original Sin, and Thus are Far from Being Manicheans.</span></p>  
<p><a name="xvi.vi.x-p2"></A>Listen, then, for a little while, and observe what is involved in this question. Catholics say that human nature was created good by the good God as Creator; but that, having been corrupted by sin, it needs the physician Christ. The Manicheans affirm, that human nature was not created by God good, and corrupted by sin; but that man was formed by the prince of eternal darkness of a mixture of two natures which had ever existed&#8212;one good and the other evil. The Pelagians and C&#339;lestians say that human nature was created good by the good God; but that it is still so sound and healthy in infants at their birth, that they have no need at that age of Christ&#146;s medicine. Recognise, then, your name in your dogma; and cease from intruding upon the catholics, who refute you, a name and a dogma which belong to others. For truth rejects both parties&#8212;the Manicheans and yourselves. To the Manicheans it says: &#8220;Have ye not read that He which made man at the beginning, made them male and female; and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2212"></A><A HREF="#fn_2212"><FONT SIZE="1">2213</FONT></A>
 Now Christ shows, in this passage, that God is both the Creator of man, and the uniter in marriage of husband and wife; whereas the Manicheans deny both these propositions. To you, however, He says: &#8220;The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2213"></A><A HREF="#fn_2213"><FONT SIZE="1">2214</FONT></A>
 But you, admirable Christians as you are, answer Christ: &#8220;If you came to seek and to save that which was lost, then you did not come for infants; for they were not lost, but are born in a state of salvation: go to older men; we give you a rule from your own words: &#145;They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.&#146;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2214"></A><A HREF="#fn_2214"><FONT SIZE="1">2215</FONT></A>
 Now, as it happens, the Manichean, who says that man has evil mixed in his nature, must wish his good soul at any rate to be saved by Christ; whereas you contend that there is in infants nothing to be sired by Christ, since they are already safe.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2215"></A><A HREF="#fn_2215"><FONT SIZE="1">2216</FONT></A>
 And thus the Manichean besets human nature with his detestable censure, and you with your cruel praise. For whosoever shall believe your laudation, will never bring their babes to the Saviour. Entertaining such impious views as these, of what use is it that you fearlessly face that which is enacted for you&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2216"></A><A HREF="#fn_2216"><FONT SIZE="1">2217</FONT></A>
 in order to induce salutary fear and to treat you as a human being, and not as that poor animal of yours which was surrounded with the coloured feathers to be driven into the hunting toils? Need was that you should hold the truth, and, on account of zeal for it, have no fear; but, as things are, you evade fear in such wise that, if you feared, you would rather run away from the net of the malignant one than run into it. The reason why your catholic mother alarms you is, because she fears for both you and others from you; and if by the help of her sons who possess any authority in the State she acts with a view to make you afraid, she does so, not from cruelty, but from love. You, however, are a very brave man; and you deem it the coward&#146;s part to be afraid of men. Well then, fear God; and do not try with such obstinacy to subvert the ancient foundations of the catholic faith. Although I could even wish that spirited temper of yours would entertain some little fear of human authority, at least in the present case. I could wish, I say, that it would rather tremble through cowardice than perish through audacity.</p>
