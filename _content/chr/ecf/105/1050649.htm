<p><a name="xvi.vi.xliii-p2"></A>I have an answer ready for all this; but before I give it, I wish the reader carefully to notice, that the result of the opinions of these persons is, that no Saviour is necessary for infants, whom they deem to be entirely without any sins to be saved from. This vast perversion of the truth, so hostile to God&#146;s great grace, which is given through our Lord Jesus Christ, who &#8220;came to seek and to save what was lost,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2282"></A><A HREF="#fn_2282"><FONT SIZE="1">2283</FONT></A>
 tries to insinuate its way into the hearts of the unintelligent by eulogizing the works of God; that is, by its eulogy of human nature, of human seed, of marriage, of sexual intercourse, of the fruits of matrimony&#8212;which are all of them good things. I will not say that he adds the praise of lust; because he too is ashamed even to name it, so that it is something else, and not <i>it</i>, which he seems to praise. By this method of his, not distinguishing between the evils which have accrued to nature and the goodness of nature&#146;s very self, he does not, indeed, show it to be sound (because that is untrue), but he does not permit its diseased condition to be healed. And, therefore, that first proposition of ours, to the effect that the good thing, even the human being, which is born of adultery, does not excuse the sin of adulterous connection, he allows to be true; and this point, which occasions no question to arise between us, he even defends and strengthens (as he well may) by his similitude of the thief who sows the seed which he stole, and out of which there arises a really good harvest. Our other proposition, however, that &#8220;the good of marriage cannot be blamed for the original sin which is derived from it,&#8221; he will not admit to be true; if, indeed, he assented to it, he would not be a Pelagian heretic, but a catholic Christian. &#8220;Certainly,&#8221; says he, &#8220;if evil arises from marriage, it may be blamed, nay, cannot be excused; and you place its work and fruit under the devil&#146;s power, because everything which is <A NAME="page_300"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 300</FONT></A> <a name="xvi.vi.xliii-Page_300"></A>the cause of evil is itself without good.&#8221; And in addition to this, he contrived other arguments to show that good could not possibly be the cause of evil; and from this he drew the inference, that marriage, which is a good, is not the cause of evil; and that consequently from it no man could be born in a sinful state, and having need of a Saviour: just as if we said that marriage is the cause of sin, though it is true that the human being which is born in wedlock is not born without sin. Marriage was instituted not for the purpose of sinning, but of producing children. Accordingly the Lord&#146;s blessing on the married state ran thus: &#8220;Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2283"></A><A HREF="#fn_2283"><FONT SIZE="1">2284</FONT></A>
 The sin, however, which is derived to children from marriage does not belong to marriage, but to the evil which accrues to the human agents, from whose union marriage comes into being. The truth is, both the evil of shameful lust can exist without marriage, and marriage might have been without it. It appertains, however, to the condition of the body (not of that life, but) of this death, that marriage cannot exist without it though it may exist without marriage. Of course that lust of the flesh which causes shame has existence out of the married state, whenever it urges men to the commission of adultery, chambering and uncleanness, so utterly hostile to the purity of marriage; or again, when it does not commit any of these things, because the human agent gives no permission or assent to their commission, but still rises and is set in motion and creates disturbance, and (especially in dreams) effects the likeness of its own veritable work, and reaches the end of its own emotion. Well, now, this is an evil which is not even in the married state actually an evil of marriage; but it has this apparatus all ready in the body of this death, even against its own will, which is indispensable no doubt for the accomplishment of that which it does will. The evil in question, therefore, does not accrue to marriage from its own institution, which was blessed; but entirely from the circumstance that sin entered into the world by one man, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2284"></A><A HREF="#fn_2284"><FONT SIZE="1">2285</FONT></A>
