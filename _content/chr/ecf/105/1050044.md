<span id="x.iii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 26 \[XX.\]—No One, Except He Be
Baptized, Rightly Comes to the Table of the Lord.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>Now they take alarm from the statement
of the Lord, when He says, “Except a man be born again, he cannot see
the kingdom of God;” <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289) because in
His own explanation of the passage He affirms, “Except a man be born of
water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290) And so they try to ascribe to
unbaptized infants, by the merit of their innocence, the gift of
salvation and eternal life, but at the same time, owing to their being
unbaptized, to exclude them from the kingdom of heaven. But how novel
and astonishing is such an assumption, as if there could possibly be
salvation and eternal life without heirship with Christ, without the
kingdom of heaven! Of course they have their refuge, whither to escape
and hide themselves, because the Lord does not say, Except a man be born
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot have life, but—“he cannot enter
into the kingdom of God.” If indeed He had said the other, there could
have risen not a moment’s doubt. Well, then, let us remove the doubt;
let us now listen to the Lord, and not to men’s notions and conjectures;
let us, I say, hear what the Lord says—not indeed concerning the
sacrament of the laver, but concerning the sacrament of His own holy
table, to which none but a baptized person has a right to approach:
“Except ye eat my flesh and drink my blood, ye shall have no life in
you.” <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291) What do we want more? What
answer to this can be adduced, unless it be by that obstinacy which ever
resists the constancy of manifest truth?
