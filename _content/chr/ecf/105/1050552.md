id="xv.iv.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 41 \[XXXVI.\]—Lust and Travail Come
from Sin. Whence Our Members Became a Cause of Shame.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xli-p2"></span>Granted, therefore, that we have no means
of showing both that the nuptial acts of that primeval marriage were
quietly discharged, undisturbed by lustful passion, and that the motion
of the organs of generation, like that of any other members of the body,
was not instigated by the ardour of lust, but directed by the choice of
the will (which would have continued such with marriage had not the
disgrace of sin intervened); still, from all that is stated in the
sacred Scriptures on divine authority, we have reasonable grounds for
believing that such was the original condition of wedded life. Although,
it is true, I am not told that the nuptial embrace was unattended with
prurient desire; as also I do not find it on record that parturition was
unaccompanied with groans and pain, or that actual birth led not to
future death; yet, at the same time, if I follow the verity of the Holy
Scriptures, the travail of the mother and the death of the human
offspring would never have supervened if sin had not preceded. Nor would
that have happened which abashed the man and woman when they covered
their loins; because in the same sacred records it is expressly written
that the sin was first committed, and then immediately followed this
hiding of their shame. <span id="fr_2027"></span>[2028](#fn_2027) For
unless some indelicacy of motion had announced to their eyes—which were
of course not closed, though not open to this point, that is, not
attentive—that those particular members should be corrected, they would
not have perceived anything on their own persons, which God had entirely
made worthy of all praise, that called for either shame or concealment.
If, indeed, the sin had not first occurred which they had dared to
commit in their disobedience, there would not have followed the disgrace
which their shame would fain conceal.
