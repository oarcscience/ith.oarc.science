<span id="xix.iv.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 24 \[XII.\]—Who May Be Said to Wish
to Establish Their Own Righteousness. “God’s Righteousness,” So Called,
Which Man Has from God.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xxiv-p2"></span>As many, therefore, as are led by their
own spirit, trusting in their own virtue, with the addition merely of
the law’s assistance, without the help of grace, are not the sons of
God. Such are they of whom the same apostle speaks as “being ignorant of
God’s righteousness, and wishing to establish their own righteousness,
who have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.” <span
id="fr_3084"></span>[3085](#fn_3084) He said this of the Jews, who in
their self-assumption rejected grace, and therefore did not believe in
Christ. Their own righteousness, indeed, he says, they wish to
establish; and this righteousness is of the law,—not that the law was
established by themselves, but that they had constituted their
righteousness in the law which is of God, when they supposed themselves
able to fulfil that law by their own strength, ignorant of God’s
righteousness,—not indeed that by which God is Himself righteous, but
that which man has from God. And that you may know that he designated as
*theirs* the righteousness which is of the law, and as *God’s* that
which man receives from God, hear what he says in another passage, when
speaking of Christ: “For whose sake I counted all things not only as
loss, but I deemed them to be dung, that I might win Christ, and be
found in Him—not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but
that which is through the faith of Christ, which is of God.” <span
id="fr_3085"></span>[3086](#fn_3085) Now what does he mean by “not
having my own righteousness, which is of the law,” when the law is
really not his at all, but God’s,—except this, that he called it his own
righteousness, although it was of the law, because he <span
id="page_454">p. 454</span> <span
id="xix.iv.xxiv-Page_454"></span>thought he could fulfil the law by his
own will, without the aid of grace which is through faith in Christ?
Wherefore, after saying, “Not having my own righteousness, which is of
the law,” he immediately subjoined, “But that which is through the faith
of Christ, which is of God.” This is what they were ignorant of, of whom
he says, “Being ignorant of God’s righteousness,”—that is, the
righteousness which is of God (for it is given not by the letter, which
kills, but by the life-giving Spirit), “and wishing to establish their
own righteousness,” which he expressly described as the righteousness of
the law, when he said, “Not having my own righteousness, which is of the
law;” they were not subject to the righteousness of God,—in other words,
they submitted not themselves to the grace of God. For they were under
the law, not under grace, and therefore sin had dominion over them, from
which a man is not freed by the law, but by grace. On which account he
elsewhere says, “For sin shall not have dominion over you; because ye
are not under the law, but under grace.” <span
id="fr_3086"></span>[3087](#fn_3086) Not that the law is evil; but
because they are under its power, whom it makes guilty by imposing
commandments, not by aiding. It is by grace that any one is a doer of
the law; and without this grace, he who is placed under the law will be
only a hearer of the law. To such persons he addresses these words: “Ye
who are justified by the law are fallen from grace.” <span
