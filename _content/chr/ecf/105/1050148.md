<span id="x.iv.lix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 59.—Whether the Soul is Propagated; On
Obscure Points, Concerning Which the Scriptures Give Us No Assistance,
We Must Be on Our Guard Against Forming Hasty Judgments and Opinions;
The Scriptures are Clear Enough on Those Subjects Which are Necessary to
Salvation.</span>

<span id="x.iv.lix-p2"></span>Concerning *the soul*, indeed, the
question arises, whether it, too, is propagated in the same way \[as the
flesh,\] and bound by the same guilt, which is forgiven to it—for we
cannot say that it is only the flesh of the infant, and not his soul
also, which requires the help of a Saviour and Redeemer, or that the
latter must not be included in that thanksgiving in the Psalms, where we
read and repeat, “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His
benefits; who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
diseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction.” <span
id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647) Or if it be not likewise propagated,
we may ask, whether, by the very fact of its being mingled with and
weighed down by the sinful flesh, it still has need of the remission of
its own sin, and of a redemption of its own, God being judge, in the
height of His foreknowledge, <span id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648)
what infants do not deserve <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649) to
be absolved from that guilt, even before they are born, or have in any
instance ever done anything good or evil. The question also arises, how
God (even if He does not create souls by natural propagation) can yet
not be the Author of that very guilt, on account of which redemption by
the sacrament is necessary to the infant’s soul. The subject is a wide
and important one, <span id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650) <span
id="page_68">p. 68</span> <span id="x.iv.lix-Page_68"></span>and
requires another treatise. The discussion, however, so far as I can
judge, ought to be conducted with temper and moderation, so as to
deserve the praise of cautious inquiry, rather than the censure of
headstrong assertion. For whenever a question arises on an unusually
obscure subject, on which no assistance can be rendered by clear and
certain proofs of the Holy Scriptures, the presumption of man ought to
restrain itself; nor should it attempt anything definite by leaning to
either side. But if I must indeed be ignorant concerning any points of
this sort, as to how they can be explained and proved, this much I
should still believe, that from this very circumstance the Holy
Scriptures would possess a most clear authority, whenever a point arose
which no man could be ignorant of, without imperilling the salvation
which has been promised him. You have now before you, \[my dear
Marcellinus,\] this treatise, worked out to the best of my ability. I
only wish that its value equalled its length; for its length I might
probably be able to justify, only I should fear that, by adding the
justification, I should stretch the prolixity beyond your endurance.
