<span id="xx.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—There is a Greater Freedom Now
in the Saints Than There Was Before in Adam.</span>

<span id="xx.xxxviii-p2"></span>Certainly a greater liberty is necessary
in the face of so many and so great temptations, which had no existence
in Paradise,—a liberty fortified and confirmed by the gift of
perseverance, so that this world, with all its loves, its fears, its
errors, may be overcome: the martyrdoms of the saints have taught this.
In fine, he \[Adam\], not only with nobody to make him afraid, but,
moreover, in spite of the authority of God’s fear, using free will, did
not stand in such a state of happiness, in such a facility <span
id="fr_3358"></span>[3359](#fn_3358) of \[not\] sinning. But these \[the
saints\], I say, not under the fear of the world, but in spite of the
rage of the world lest they should stand, stood firm in the faith; while
he could see the good things present which he was going to forsake, they
could not see the good things future which they were going to receive.
Whence is this, save by the gift of Him from whom they obtained mercy to
be faithful; from whom they received the spirit, not of fear, whereby
they would yield to the persecutors, but of power, and of love, and of
continence, in which they could overcome all threatenings, all
seductions, all torments? To him, therefore, without any sin, was given
the free will with which he was created; and he made it to serve sin.
But although the will of these had been the servant of sin, it was
delivered by Him who said, “If the Son shall make you free, then shall
ye be free indeed.” <span id="fr_3359"></span>[3360](#fn_3359) And by
that grace they receive so great a freedom, that although as long as
they live here they are fighting against sinful lusts, and some sins
creep upon them unawares, on account of which they daily say, “Forgive
us our debts,” <span id="fr_3360"></span>[3361](#fn_3360) yet they do
not any more obey the sin which is unto death, of which the Apostle John
says, “There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for
it.” <span id="fr_3361"></span>[3362](#fn_3361) Concerning which sin
(since it is not expressed) many and different notions may be
entertained. I, however, say, that sin is to forsake even unto death the
faith which worketh by love. This sin they no longer serve who are not
in the first condition, as Adam, free; but are freed by the grace of God
through the second Adam, and by that deliverance have that free will
which enables them to serve God, not that by which they may be made
captive by the devil. From being made free from sin they have become the
servants of righteousness, <span id="fr_3362"></span>[3363](#fn_3362) in
which they will stand till the end, by the gift to them of perseverance
from Him who foreknew them, and predestinated them, and called them
according to His purpose, and justified them, and glorified them, since
He has even already formed those things that are to come which He
promised concerning them. And when He promised, “Abraham believed Him,
and it was counted unto him for righteousness.” <span
id="fr_3363"></span>[3364](#fn_3363) For “he gave glory to God, most
fully believing,” as it is written, “that what He has promised He is
able also to perform.” <span id="fr_3364"></span>[3365](#fn_3364)
