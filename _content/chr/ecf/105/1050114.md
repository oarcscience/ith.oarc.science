<span id="x.iv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25.—God Punishes Both in Wrath and in
Mercy.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxv-p2"></span>Although there are some men who are so
eminent in righteousness that God speaks to them out of His cloudy
pillar, such as “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among
them that call upon His name,” <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555)
the latter of whom is much praised for his piety and purity in the
Scriptures of truth, from his earliest childhood, in which his mother,
to accomplish her vow, placed him in God’s temple, and devoted <span
id="page_55">p. 55</span> <span id="x.iv.xxv-Page_55"></span>him to the
Lord as His servant;—yet even of such men it is written, “Thou, O God,
wast propitious unto them, though Thou didst punish all their
devices.” <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556) Now the children of
wrath God punishes in anger; whereas it is in mercy that He punishes the
children of grace; since “whom He loveth He correcteth, and scourgeth
every son whom He receiveth.” <span id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557)
However, there are no punishments, no correction, no scourge of God, but
what are owing to sin, except in the case of Him who prepared His back
for the smiter, in order that He might experience all things in our
likeness without sin, in order that He might be the saintly Priest of
saints, making intercession even for saints, who with no sacrifice of
truth say each one even for himself, “Forgive us our trespasses, even as
we also forgive them that trespass against us.”  <span
id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558) Wherefore even our opponents in this
controversy, whilst they are chaste in their life, and commendable in
character, and although they do not hesitate to do that which the Lord
enjoined on the rich man, who inquired of Him about the attainment of
eternal life, after he had told Him, in answer to His first question,
that he had already fully kept every commandment in the law,—that “if he
wished to be perfect, he must sell all that he had and give to the poor,
and transfer his treasure to heaven;” <span
id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559) yet they do not in any one instance
venture to say that they are without sin. But this, as we believe, they
refrain from saying, with deceitful intent; but if they are lying, in
this very act they begin either to augment or commit sin.
