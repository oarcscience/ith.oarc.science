<span id="xii.lxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 58 \[L.\]—Even Pious and God-Fearing
Men Resist Grace.</span>

<span id="xii.lxii-p2"></span>Observe also what remark he adds, by which
he thinks that his position is confirmed: “No will,” says he, “can take
away that which is proved to be inseparably implanted in nature.” Whence
then comes that utterance: “So then ye cannot do the things that ye
would?” <span id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264) Whence also this:
“For what good I would, that I do not; but what evil I hate, that do
I?” <span id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265) Where is that capacity
which is proved to be inseparably implanted in nature? See, it is human
beings who do not what they will; and it is about not sinning,
certainly, that he was treating,—not about not flying, because it was
men not birds, that formed his subject. Behold, it is man who does not
the good which he would, but does the evil which he would not: “to will
is present with him, but how to perform that which is good is not
present.” <span id="fr_1266"></span>[1267](#fn_1266) Where is the
capacity which is proved to be inseparably implanted in nature? For
whomsoever the apostle represents by himself, if he does not speak these
things of his own self, he certainly represents a man by himself. By our
author, however, it is maintained that our human nature actually
possesses an inseparable capacity of not at all sinning. Such a
statement, however, even when made by a man who knows not the effect of
his words (but this ignorance is hardly attributable to the man who
suggests these statements for unwary though God-fearing men), causes the
grace of Christ to be “made of none effect,” <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[1268](#fn_1267) since it is pretended that human
nature is sufficient for its own holiness and justification.

Another reading has *crux Christi* instead of “Christi gratia,” thus
closely adopting the apostle’s words.
