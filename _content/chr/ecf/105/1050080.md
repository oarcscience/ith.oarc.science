<span id="x.iii.lxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.lxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 62 \[XXXIII.\]—No One Can Be
Reconciled to God, Except by Christ.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lxii-p2"></span>He then proceeds thus, saying: “God so
loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430) Every infant, therefore, was destined
to perish, and to lose everlasting life, if through the sacrament of
baptism he believed not in the only-begotten Son of God; while
nevertheless, He comes not so that he may judge the world, but that the
world through Him may be saved. This especially appears in the following
clause, wherein He says, “He that believeth in Him is not condemned; but
he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed
in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.” <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431) In what class, then, do we place
baptized infants but amongst believers, as the authority of the catholic
Church everywhere asserts? They belong, therefore, among those who have
believed; for this is obtained for them by virtue of the sacrament and
the answer of their sponsors. And from this it follows that such as are
not baptized are reckoned among those who have not believed. Now if they
who are baptized are not condemned, these last, as not being baptized,
are condemned. He adds, indeed: “But this is the condemnation, that
light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than
light. <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432) Of what does He say,
“Light is come into the world,” if not of His own advent? and without
the sacrament of His advent, how are infants said to be in the light?
And why should we not include this fact also in “men’s love of
darkness,” that as they do not themselves believe, so they refuse to
think that their infants ought to be baptized, although they are afraid
of their incurring the death of the body? “In God,” however, he declares
are the “works of him wrought, who cometh to the light,” <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433) because he is quite aware that his
justification results from no merits of his own, but from the grace of
God. “For it is God,” says the apostle, “who worketh in you both to will
and to do of His own good pleasure.” <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434) This then is the way in which
spiritual regeneration is effected in all who come to Christ from their
carnal generation. He explained it Himself, and pointed it out, when He
was asked, How these things could be? He left it open to no man to
settle such a question by human reasoning, lest infants should be
deprived of the grace of the remission of sins. There is no other
passage leading to Christ; no man can be reconciled to God, or can come
to God otherwise, than through Christ.
