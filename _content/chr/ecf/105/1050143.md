id="x.iv.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 54 \[XXXIV.\]—Why Punishment is Still
Inflicted, After Sin Has Been Forgiven.</span>

<span id="x.iv.liv-p2"></span>But, inasmuch as there are not wanting
persons of such character, just as we say in answer to those who raise
this question, that those things are punishments of sins before
remission, which after remission become contests and exercises of the
righteous; so again to such persons as are similarly perplexed about the
death of the body, our answer ought to be so drawn as to show both that
we acknowledge it to have accrued because of sin, and that we are not
discouraged by the punishment of sins having been bequeathed to us for
an exercise of discipline, in order that our great fear of it may be
overcome by us as we advance in holiness. For if only small virtue
accrued to “the faith which worketh by love” in conquering the fear of
death, there would be no great glory for the martyrs; nor could the Lord
say, “Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for
his friends;” <span id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636) which John in his
epistle expresses in these terms: “As He laid down His life for us, so
ought we to lay down our lives for the brethren.” <span
id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637) In vain, therefore, would commendation
be bestowed on the most eminent suffering in encountering or despising
death for righteousness’ sake, if there were not in death itself a
really great and very severe trial. And the man who overcomes the fear
of it by his faith, procures a great glory and just recompense for his
faith itself. Wherefore it ought to surprise no one, either that the
death of the body could not possibly have happened to man unless sin had
been previously committed, since it was of this that it was to become
the punishment; nor that after the remission of their sins it comes to
the faithful, in order that in their triumphing over the fear of it, the
fortitude of righteousness may be exercised.
