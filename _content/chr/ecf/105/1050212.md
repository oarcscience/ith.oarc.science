<span id="xi.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36 \[XXI.\]—The Law Written in Our
Hearts.</span>

<span id="xi.xxxix-p2"></span>What then is God’s law written by God
Himself in the hearts of men, but the very presence of the Holy Spirit,
who is “the finger of God,” and by whose presence is shed abroad in our
hearts the love which is the fulfilling of the law, <span
id="fr_865"></span>[866](#fn_865) and the end of the commandment? <span
id="fr_866"></span>[867](#fn_866) Now the promises of the Old Testament
are earthly; and yet (with the exception of the sacramental ordinances
which were the shadow of things to come, such as circumcision, the
Sabbath and other observances of days, and the ceremonies of certain
meats, <span id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867) and the complicated
ritual of sacrifices and sacred things which suited “the oldness” of the
carnal law and its slavish yoke) it contains such precepts of
righteousness as we are even now taught to observe, which were
especially expressly drawn out on the two tables without figure or
shadow: for instance, “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” “Thou shalt do
no murder,” “Thou shalt not covet,” <span
id="fr_868"></span>[869](#fn_868) “and whatsoever other commandment is
briefly comprehended in the saying, Thou shall love thy neighbour as
thyself.” <span id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869) Nevertheless, whereas
as in the said Testament earthly and temporal promises are, as I have
said, recited, and these are goods of this corruptible flesh (although
they prefigure those heavenly and everlasting blessings which belong to
the New Testament), what is now promised is a good for the heart itself,
a good for the mind, a good of the spirit, that is, an intellectual
good; since it is said, “I will put my law in their inward parts, and in
their hearts will I write them,”  <span
id="fr_870"></span>[871](#fn_870) —by which He signified that men would
not fear the law which alarmed them externally, but would love the very
righteousness of the law which dwelt inwardly in their hearts.
