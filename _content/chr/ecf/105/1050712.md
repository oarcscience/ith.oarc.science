<span id="xvii.v.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—To Believe the Soul is a Part of
God is Blasphemy.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.iv-p2"></span>And if you happened to suppose, before
receiving the instruction from this teacher, which you are rejoicing to
have received, that the human soul is a portion of God’s nature, then
you were ignorant how false and terribly dangerous this opinion was. And
if you only were taught by this person that the soul is not a portion of
God, then I bid you thank God as earnestly as you can that you were not
taken away out of the body before learning so important a lesson. For
you would have quitted life a great heretic and a terrible blasphemer.
However, I never could have believed this of you, that a man who is both
a catholic and a presbyter of no contemptible position like yourself,
could by any means have thought that the soul’s nature is a portion of
God. I therefore cannot help expressing to your beloved self my fears
that this man has by some means or other taught you that which is
decidedly opposed to the faith which you were holding.
