<span id="xii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[VI.\]—The Pelagians Have Very Strong
and Active Minds.</span>

<span id="xii.x-p2"></span>If we are simply wise according to the
Scriptures, we are not compelled to dispute against the grace of Christ,
and to make statements attempting to show that human nature both
requires no Physician,—in infants, because it is whole and sound; and in
adults, because it is able to suffice for itself in attaining
righteousness, if it will. Men no doubt seem to urge acute opinions on
these points, but it is only word-wisdom, <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143) by which the cross of Christ is
made of none effect. This, however, “is not the wisdom which descendeth
from above.” <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144) The words which
follow in the apostle’s statement I am unwilling to quote; for we would
rather not be thought to do an injustice to our friends, whose very
strong and active minds we should be sorry to see running in a perverse,
instead of an upright, course.
