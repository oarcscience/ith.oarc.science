id="xv.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20 \[XIX.\]—How a Man Makes a Good or
a Bad Tree.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xx-p2"></span>Now a man makes a good tree when he
receives the grace of God. For it is not by himself that he makes
himself good instead of evil; but it is of Him, and through Him, and in
Him <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span
id="xv.iii.xx-Page_224"></span>who is always good. And in order that he
may not only be a good tree, but also bear good fruit, it is necessary
for him to be assisted by the self-same grace, without which he can do
nothing good. For God Himself cooperates in the production of fruit in
good trees, when He both externally waters and tends them by the agency
of His servants, and internally by Himself also gives the
increase. <span id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828) A man, however,
makes a corrupt tree when he makes himself corrupt, when he falls away
from Him who is the unchanging good; for such a declension from Him is
the origin of an evil will. Now this decline does not initiate some
other corrupt nature, but it corrupts that which has been already
created good. When this corruption, however, has been healed, no evil
remains; for although nature no doubt had received an injury, yet nature
was not itself a blemish.  <span id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829)
