<p><a name="xi.v-p2"></A>Here, perhaps, you will say to me in answer, that the things which I have instanced as not having been realized, although capable of realization, are <i>divine</i> works; whereas a man&#146;s being without sin falls in the range of a man&#146;s own work,&#8212;that being indeed his very noblest work which effects a full and perfect righteousness complete in every part; and therefore that it is incredible that no man has ever existed, or is existing, or will exist in this life, who has achieved such a work, if the achievement is possible for a human being. But then you ought to reflect that, although this great work, no doubt, belongs to human agency to accomplish, yet it is also a divine gift, and therefore, not doubt that it is a divine work; &#8220;for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_717"></A><A HREF="#fn_717"><FONT SIZE="1">718</FONT></A>
