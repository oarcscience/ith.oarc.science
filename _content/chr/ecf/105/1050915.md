<span id="xviii.vi.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Further References to
Cyprian.</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.xxii-p2"></span>For he says also this in the epistle
whose title is inscribed, “On the Mortality:” <span
id="fr_2843"></span>[2844](#fn_2843) “The kingdom of God, beloved
brethren, is beginning to be at hand; the reward of life, and the
rejoicing of eternal salvation and perpetual gladness, and the
possession formerly lost of Paradise, are now coming with the passing
away of the world.” This again, in the same epistle, he says: “Let us
greet the day which assigns each of us to his own home, which snatches
us hence and sets us free from the snares of the world, and restores us
to Paradise and the kingdom.” Moreover, he says in the epistle
concerning Patience: “Let the judgment of God be pondered, which, even
in the beginning of the world and of the human race, Adam, forgetful of
the commandment and a transgressor of the law that had been given,
received. Then we shall know how patient in this life we ought to be,
who are born in such a state that we labour here with afflictions and
contests. Because, says He, ‘thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy
wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which alone I had charged thee that
thou shouldest not eat, cursed shall be the ground in all thy works: in
sorrow and in groaning shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
Thorns and thistles shall it give forth to thee, and thou shall eat the
food of the field. In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread,
till thou return unto the ground from which thou wast taken: for earth
thou art, and unto earth shalt thou go.’ We are all tied and bound with
the chain of this sentence until, death being destroyed, we depart from
this world.” <span id="fr_2844"></span>[2845](#fn_2844) And, moreover,
in the same epistle he says: “For, since in that first transgression of
the commandment strength of body departed with immortality, and weakness
came on with death, and strength cannot be received unless when
immortality also has been received, it behoves us in this bodily frailty
and weakness always to struggle and fight; and this struggle and
encounter cannot be sustained but by the strength of patience.” <span
