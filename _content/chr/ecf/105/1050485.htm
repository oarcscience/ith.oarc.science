<p><a name="xv.iii.xxx-p2"></A>In like manner, in another passage of the same book, he says: &#8220;In order that men may more easily accomplish by grace that which they are commanded to do by free will.&#8221; Now, expunge the phrase &#8220;<i>more easily,</i>&#8221; and you leave not only a full, but also a sound sense, if it be regarded as meaning simply this: &#8220;That men may accomplish through grace what they are commanded to do by free will.&#8221; The addition of the words &#8220;more easily,&#8221; however, tacitly suggests the possibility of accomplishing good works even without the grace of God. But such a meaning is disallowed by Him who says, &#8220;Without me ye can do nothing.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1863"></A><A HREF="#fn_1863"><FONT SIZE="1">1864</FONT></A>
