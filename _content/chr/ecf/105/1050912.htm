<p><a name="xviii.vi.xix-p2"></A>And if these things be so, let the Pelagians cease by their most insidious praises of these five things&#8212;that is, the praise of the creature, the praise of marriage, the praise of the law, the praise of free will, the praise of the saints&#8212;from feigning that they desire to pluck men, as it were, from the little snares of the Manicheans, in order that they may entangle them in their own nets&#8212;that is, that they may deny original sin; may begrudge to infants the aid of Christ the physician; may say that the grace of God is given according to our merits, and thus that grace is no more grace; and may say that the saints in this life had not sin, and thus make the prayer of none effect which He gave to the saints who had no sin, and by which all sin is pardoned to the saints that pray unto Him. To these three evil doctrines, they by their deceitful praise of these five good things seduce careless and unlearned men. Concerning all which things, I think I have sufficiently censured their most cruel and wicked and proud vanity.</p>
