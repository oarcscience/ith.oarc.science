<span id="xvi.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[XXI.\]—Sin Has Not Arisen Out
of the Goodness of Marriage; The Sacrament of Matrimony a Great One in
the Case of Christ and the Church—A Very Small One in the Case of a Man
and His Wife.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xxiii-p2"></span>If now we interrogate, so to speak,
those goods of marriage to which we have often referred, <span
id="fr_2141"></span>[2142](#fn_2141) and inquire how it is that sin
could possibly have been propagated from them to infants, we shall get
this answer from the first of them—the work of procreation of offspring:
“My happiness would in paradise have been greater if sin had not been
committed. For to me belongs that blessing of almighty God: ‘Be
fruitful, and multiply.’ <span id="fr_2142"></span>[2143](#fn_2142) For
accomplishing this good work, divers members were created suited to each
sex; these members were, of course, in existence before sin, but they
were not objects of shame.” This will be the answer of the second
good—the fidelity of chastity: “If sin had not been committed, what in
paradise could have been more secure than myself, when there was no lust
of my own to spur me, none of another to tempt me?” And then this will
be the answer of the sacramental bond of marriage,—the third good: “Of
me was that word spoken in paradise before the entrance of sin: ‘A man
shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife;
and they two shall become one flesh.’” <span
id="fr_2143"></span>[2144](#fn_2143) This the apostle applies to the
case of Christ and of the Church, and calls it then “a great
sacrament.” <span id="fr_2144"></span>[2145](#fn_2144) What, then, in
Christ and in the Church is great, in the instances of each married pair
it is but very small, but even then it is the sacrament of an
inseparable union. What now is there in these three blessings of
marriage out of which the bond of sin could pass over to posterity?
Absolutely nothing. And in these blessings it is certain that the
goodness of matrimony is entirely comprised; and even now good wedlock
consists of these same blessings.
