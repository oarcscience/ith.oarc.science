id="xiv.lxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 63.—The Same Continued. The Dogmas of
Cœlestius Laid to the Charge of Pelagius, as His Master, and
Condemned.</span>

<span id="xiv.lxvii-p2"></span>Of the opinions which Cœlestius has said
or written, and which were objected against Pelagius, on the ground that
they were the dogmas of his disciple, he acknowledged some as
entertained also by himself; but, in his vindication, he said that he
held them in a different sense from that which was alleged in the
indictment. One of these opinions was thus stated: “Before the advent of
Christ some men lived holy and righteous lives.” <span
id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772) Cœlestius, however, was stated to
have said that “they lived *sinless* lives.” Again, it was objected that
Cœlestius declared “the Church to be without spot and wrinkle.” <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1774](#fn_1773) Pelagius, however, said in his
reply, “that he had made such an assertion, but as meaning that the
Church is by the laver cleansed from every spot and wrinkle, and that in
this purity the Lord would have her continue.” Respecting that statement
<span id="page_211">p. 211</span> <span
id="xiv.lxvii-Page_211"></span>of Cœlestius: “That we do more than is
commanded us in the law and the gospel,” Pelagius urged in his own
vindication, <span id="fr_1774"></span>[1775](#fn_1774) that “he spoke
concerning virginity,” of which Paul says: “I have no commandment of the
Lord.” <span id="fr_1775"></span>[1776](#fn_1775) Another objection
alleged that Cœlestius had maintained that “every individual has the
ability to possess all powers and graces,” thus annulling that
“diversity of gifts” which, the apostle sets forth. <span
id="fr_1776"></span>[1777](#fn_1776) Pelagius, however, answered, that
“he did not annul the diversity of gifts, but declared that God gives to
the man who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all graces, even
as He gave the Apostle Paul.”
