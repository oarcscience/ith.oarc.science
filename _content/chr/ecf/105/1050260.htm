<p class="c46"><a name="xii.xvii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xii.xvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 13 [XII.]&#8212;The Scope and Purpose of the Law&#146;s Threatenings; &#8220;Perfect Wayfarers.&#8221;</span></p>   
<p><a name="xii.xvii-p2"></A>But before I proceed further, see what he has said. When treating the question about the difference of sins, and starting as an objection to himself, what certain persons allege, &#8220;that some sins are light by their very frequency, their constant irruption making it impossible that they should be all of them avoided;&#8221; he thereupon denied that it was &#8220;proper that they should be censured even as light offences, if they cannot possibly be wholly avoided.&#8221; He of course does not notice the Scriptures of the New Testament, wherein we learn&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1151"></A><A HREF="#fn_1151"><FONT SIZE="1">1152</FONT></A>
 that the intention of the law in its censure is this, that, by reason of the transgressions which men commit, they may flee for refuge to the grace of the Lord, who has pity upon them&#8212;&#8220;the schoolmaster&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1152"></A><A HREF="#fn_1152"><FONT SIZE="1">1153</FONT></A>
 &#8220;shutting them up unto the same faith which should afterwards be revealed;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1153"></A><A HREF="#fn_1153"><FONT SIZE="1">1154</FONT></A>
 that by it their transgressions may be forgiven, and then not again be committed, by God&#146;s assisting grace. The road indeed belongs to all who are progressing in it; although it is they who make a good advance that are called &#8220;perfect travellers.&#8221; That, however, is the height of perfection which admits of no addition, when the goal to which men tend has begun to be possessed.</p>
