<span id="xv.iii.liii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 53 \[XLVIII.\]—In What Sense Some
Men May Be Said to Live Without Sin in the Present Life.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.liii-p2"></span>But in reference to the particular
point in which he quoted the holy Ambrose with so much
approbation,—because he found in that author’s writings, from the
praises he accorded to Zacharias and Elisabeth, the opinion that a man
might possibly in this life be without sin; <span
id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913) although this cannot be denied if
God wills it, with whom all things are possible, yet he ought to
consider more carefully *in what sense* this was said. Now, so far as I
can see, this statement was made in accordance with a certain standard
of conduct, which is among men held to be worthy of approval and praise,
and which no human being could justly call in question for the purpose
of laying accusation or censure. Such a standard Zacharias and his wife
Elisabeth are said to have maintained in the sight of God, for no other
reason than that they, by walking therein, never deceived people by any
dissimulation; but as they in their sincerity appeared to men, so were
they known in the sight of God. <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914) The statement, however, was not
made with any reference to that perfect state of righteousness in which
we shall one day live truly and absolutely in a condition of spotless
purity. The Apostle Paul, indeed, has told us that he was “blameless, as
touching the righteousness which is of the law;” <span
id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915) and it was in respect of the same
law that Zacharias also lived a blameless life. This righteousness,
however, the apostle counted as “dung” and “loss,” in comparison with
the righteousness which is the object of our hope, <span
id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916) and which we ought to “hunger and
thirst after,” <span id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917) in order that
hereafter we may be satisfied with the vision thereof, enjoying it now
by faith, so long as “the just do live by faith.” <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918)
