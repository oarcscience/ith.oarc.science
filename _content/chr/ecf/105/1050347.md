<span id="xiii.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—(11.) The Eleventh Breviate.</span>

<span id="xiii.xv-p2"></span>XI. “The next question which must be put,”
he says, “is, in how many ways all sin is manifested? In two, if I
mistake not: if either those things are done which are forbidden, or
those things are not done which are commanded. Now, it is just as
certain that all things which are forbidden are able to be avoided, as
it is that all things which are commanded are able to be effected. For
it is vain either to forbid or to enjoin that which cannot either be
guarded against or accomplished. And how shall we deny the possibility
of man’s being without sin, when we are compelled to admit that he can
as well avoid all those things which are forbidden, as do all those
which are commanded?” My answer is, that in the Holy Scriptures there
are many divine precepts, to mention the whole of which would be too
laborious; but the Lord, who on earth consummated and abridged <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385) His word, expressly declared that
the law and the prophets hung on two commandments, <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386) that we might understand that
whatever else has been enjoined on us by God ends in these two
commandments, and must be referred to them: “Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
mind;” <span id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387) and “Thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thyself.” <span id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388)
“On these two commandments,” says He, “hang all the law and the
prophets.” <span id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389) Whatever,
therefore, we are by God’s law forbidden, and whatever we are bidden to
do, we are forbidden and bidden with the direct object of fulfilling
these two commandments. And perhaps the general prohibition is, “Thou
shalt not covet;” <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390) and the
general precept, “Thou shalt love.” <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391) Accordingly the Apostle Paul, in a
certain place, briefly embraced the two, expressing the prohibition in
these words, “Be not conformed to this world,” <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392) and the command in these, “But be
ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.” <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393) The former falls under the negative
precept, not to covet; the latter under the positive one, to love. The
one has reference to continence, the other to righteousness. The one
enjoins avoidance of evil; the other, pursuit of good. By eschewing
covetousness we put off the old man, and by showing love we put on the
new. But no man can be continent unless God endow him with the
gift; <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394) nor is God’s love shed
abroad in our hearts by our own selves, but by the Holy Ghost that is
given to us. <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395) This, however,
takes place day after day in those who advance by willing, believing,
and praying, and who, “forgetting those things which are behind, reach
forth unto those things which are before.” <span
id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396) For the reason why the law
inculcates all these precepts is, that when a man has failed in
fulfilling them, he may not be swollen with pride, and so exalt himself,
but may in very weariness betake himself to grace. Thus the law fulfils
its office as “schoolmaster,” so terrifying the man as “to lead him to
Christ,” to give Him his love. <span
