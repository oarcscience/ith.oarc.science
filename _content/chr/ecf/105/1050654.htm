<p><a name="xvi.vi.xlviii-p2"></A>Still let him ply his question: &#8220;By what means may sin be discovered in an infant?&#8221; He may find an answer in the inspired pages: &#8220;By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned.&#8221; &#8220;Through the offence of one many are dead.&#8221; &#8220;The judgment was from one to condemnation.&#8221; &#8220;By one man&#146;s offence death reigned by one.&#8221; &#8220;By the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation.&#8221; &#8220;By one man&#146;s disobedience many were made sinners.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2298"></A><A HREF="#fn_2298"><FONT SIZE="1">2299</FONT></A>
 Behold, then, &#8220;by what means sins may be discovered in an infant.&#8221; Let him now believe in original sin; let him permit infants to come to Christ, that they may be saved. [XXVIII.] What means this passage of his: &#8220;He sins not who is born; he sins not who begat him; He sins not who created him. Amidst these intrenchments of innocence, therefore, what are the breaches through which you pretend that sin entered?&#8221; Why does he search for a hidden chink when he has an open door? &#8220;By one man,&#8221; says the apostle; &#8220;through the offence of one,&#8221; says the apostle; &#8220;By one man&#146;s disobedience,&#8221; says the apostle. What does he want more? What does he require plainer? What does he expect to be more impressively repeated?</p>
