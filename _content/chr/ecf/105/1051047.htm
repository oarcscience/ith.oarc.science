<p class="c46"><a name="xxi.ii.xi-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xxi.ii.xi-p1.1"></A>Chapter 11 [VI.]&#8212;That Some Men are Elected is of God&#146;s Mercy.</span></p>  
<p><a name="xxi.ii.xi-p2"></A>&#8220;Many hear the word of truth; but some believe, while others contradict. Therefore, the former will to believe; the latter do not will.&#8221; Who does not know this? Who can deny this? But since in some the will is prepared by the Lord, in others it is not prepared, we must assuredly be able to distinguish what comes from God&#146;s mercy, and what from His judgment. &#8220;What Israel sought for,&#8221; says the apostle, &#8220;he hath not obtained, but the election hath obtained it; and the rest were blinded, as it is written, God gave to them the spirit of compunction,&#8212;eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, even to this day. And David said, Let their table be made a snare, a retribution, and a stumblingblock to them; let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see; and bow down their back always.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3457"></A><A HREF="#fn_3457"><FONT SIZE="1">3458</FONT></A>
 Here is mercy and judgment,&#8212;mercy towards the election which has obtained the righteousness of God, but judgment to the rest which have been blinded. And yet the former, because they <A NAME="page_504"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 504</FONT></A> <a name="xxi.ii.xi-Page_504"></A>willed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3458"></A><A HREF="#fn_3458"><FONT SIZE="1">3459</FONT></A>
 believed; the latter, because they did not will believed not. Therefore mercy and judgment were manifested in the very wills themselves. Certainly such an election is of grace, not at all of merits. For he had before said, &#8220;So, therefore, even at this present time, the remnant has been saved by the election of grace. And if by grace, now it is no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3459"></A><A HREF="#fn_3459"><FONT SIZE="1">3460</FONT></A>
 Therefore the election obtained what it obtained gratuitously; there preceded none of those things which they might first give, and it should be given to them again. He saved them for nothing. But to the rest who were blinded, as is there plainly declared, it was done in recompense. &#8220;All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3460"></A><A HREF="#fn_3460"><FONT SIZE="1">3461</FONT></A>
 But His ways are unsearchable. Therefore the mercy by which He freely delivers, and the truth by which He righteously judges, are equally unsearchable.</p>
