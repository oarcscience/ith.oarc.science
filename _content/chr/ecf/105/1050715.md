id="xvii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7.—To Think the Soul Corporeal an
Error.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.vii-p2"></span>But if you say to me, He has not taught
me this; nor have I by any means given my assent to this erroneous
opinion of his, however much I was enchanted by the sweetness of his
eloquent and elegant discourse; then I earnestly thank God. Still I
cannot help asking, why, even with kisses, as the report goes, you
expressed your gratitude to him for having taught you what you were
ignorant of, previous to hearing his discussion. Now if it be a false
report which makes you to have done and said so much, then I beg you to
be kind enough to give me this assurance, that the idle rumour may be
stopped by your own written authority. If, however, it is true that you
bestowed your thanks with such humility upon this man, I should rejoice,
indeed, if he has not taught you to believe the opinion which I have
already pointed out as a detestable one, and to be carefully avoided as
such. Nor shall I find fault \[IV.\] if your humble thanks to your
instructor were further earned by your having acquired from discussions
with him some other true and <span id="page_334">p. 334</span> <span
id="xvii.v.vii-Page_334"></span>useful knowledge. But may I ask you what
it is? Is it that the soul is not spirit, but body? Well, I really do
not think ignorance on such a point is any great injury to Christian
learning; and if you indulge in more subtle disputes about the different
kinds of bodily substance, I think the information you obtain is more
difficult than serviceable. If, however, the Lord will that I should
write to this young man himself, as I desire to do, then perhaps your
loving self <span id="fr_2403"></span>[2404](#fn_2403) will know to what
extent you are not indebted to him for your instruction; although you
rejoice in what you have learnt from him. And now I request you not to
feel annoyance in writing me an answer; so that what is clearly useful
and pertinent to our indispensable faith may not by any chance turn out
to be something different.
