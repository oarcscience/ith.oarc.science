<span id="xviii.v.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[IV.\]—The Calumny Concerning the
Old Testament and the Righteous Men of Old.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.vi-p2"></span>Now if these things are so, out of these
things are rebutted those which they subsequently object to us. For what
catholic would say that which they charge us with saying, “that the Holy
Spirit was not the assister of virtue in the old testament,” unless when
we so understand “the old testament” in the manner in which the apostle
spoke of it as “gendering from Mount Sinai into bondage”? But because in
it was prefigured the new testament, the men of God who at that time
understood this according to the ordering of the times, were indeed the
stewards and bearers of the old testament, but are shown to be the heirs
of the new. Shall we deny that he belongs to the new testament who says,
“Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
me”? <span id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706) or he who says, “He hath
set my feet upon a rock, and directed my goings; and he hath put a new
song in my mouth, even a hymn to our God”? <span
id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707) or that father of the faithful
before the old testament which is from Mount Sinai, of whom the apostle
says, “Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; yet even a man’s
testament, when it is confirmed, no man disannulleth or addeth thereto.
To Abraham and to his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to
seeds, as of many, but as of one; and to thy seed, which is Christ. And
this I say,” said he, “that the testament <span id="page_405">p.
405</span> <span id="xviii.v.vi-Page_405"></span>confirmed by God, the
law which was made four hundred and thirty years after, does not weaken,
so as to make the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of
the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by
promise.” <span id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708)
