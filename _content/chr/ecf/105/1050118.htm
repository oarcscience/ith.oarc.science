<p><a name="x.iv.xxix-p2"></A>Now, with reference to the passage of the apostle which I have quoted, some would maintain it to mean that &#8220;whatever amount of good will a man has, must be attributed to God on this account,&#8212;namely, because even this amount could not be in him if he were not a human being. Now, inasmuch as he has from God alone the capacity of being any thing at all, and of being human, why should there not be also attributed to God whatever there is in him of a good will, which could not exist unless he existed in whom it is?&#8221; But in this same manner it may also be said that a bad will also may be attributed to God as its author; because even it could not exist in man unless he were a man in whom it existed; but God is the author of his existence as man; and thus also of his bad will, which could have no existence if it had not a man in whom it might exist. But to argue thus is blasphemy.</p>
