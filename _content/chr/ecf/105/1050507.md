id="xv.iii.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 52 \[XLVII.\]—If Pelagius Agrees
with Ambrose, Augustin Has No Controversy with Him.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.lii-p2"></span>Inasmuch, however, as the discussion
about free will and God’s grace has such difficulty in its distinctions,
that when free will is maintained, God’s grace is apparently denied;
whilst when God’s grace is asserted, free will is supposed to be done
away with,—Pelagius can so involve himself in the shades of this
obscurity as to profess agreement with all that we have quoted from St.
Ambrose, and declare that such is, and always has been, his opinion
also; and endeavour so to explain each, that men may suppose his
opinion, to be in fair accord with Ambrose’s. So far therefore, as
concerns the questions of God’s help and grace, you are requested to
observe the three things which he has distinguished so very plainly,
under the terms “ability,” “will,” and “actuality,” that is, “capacity,”
“volition,” and “action.” <span id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912) If,
then, he has come round to an agreement with us, then not the “capacity”
alone in man, even if he neither wills nor performs the good, but the
volition and the action also,—in other words, our willing well and doing
well,—things which have no existence in man, except when he has a good
will and acts rightly:—if, I repeat, he thus consents to hold with us
that even the volition and the action are assisted by God, and so
assisted that we can neither will nor do any good thing without such
help; if, too, he believes that this is that very grace of God through
our Lord Jesus Christ which makes us righteous through His
righteousness, and not our own, so that our true righteousness is that
which we have of Him,—then, so far as I can judge, there will remain no
further controversy between us concerning the assistance we have from
the grace of God.
