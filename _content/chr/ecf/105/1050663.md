<span id="xvi.vi.lvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.vi.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 56.—The Pelagians Allow that Christ
Died Even for Infants; Julianus Slays Himself with His Own Sword.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.lvii-p2"></span>But whatever opinion he may entertain
about the shame-causing concupiscence of the flesh, I must request your
attention to what he has said respecting infants (and it is in their
behalf that we labour), as to their being supposed to need a Saviour, if
they are not to die without salvation. I repeat his words once more:
“You assert,” says he to me, “that they, indeed, who have not been ever
born might possibly have been good; those, however, who have peopled the
world, *and for whom Christ died*, you decide to be the work of the
devil, born in a disordered state, and guilty from the very beginning.”
Would that he only solved the entire controversy as he unties the knot
of this question! For will he pretend to say that he merely spoke of
adults in this passage? Why, the subject in hand is about infants, about
human beings at their birth; and it is about these that he raises odium
against us, because they are defined by us as guilty from the very
first, because we declare them to be guilty, since Christ died for them.
And why did Christ die for them if they are not guilty? It is entirely
from them, yes, from them, we shall find the reason, wherefore he
thought odium should be raised against me. He asks: “How are infants
guilty, for whom Christ died?” We answer: Nay, how are infants not
guilty, since Christ died for them? This dispute wants a judge to
determine it. Let Christ be the Judge, and let Him tell us what is the
object which has profited by His death? “This is my blood,” He says,
“which shall be shed <span id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324) for many
for the remission of sins.” <span id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325)
Let the apostle, too, be His assessor in the judgment; since even in the
apostle it is Christ Himself that speaks. Speaking of God the Father, he
exclaims: “He who spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us
all!” <span id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326) I suppose that he
describes Christ as so delivered up for us all, that infants in this
matter are not separated from ourselves. But what need is there to dwell
on this point, out of which even he no longer raises a contest? For the
truth is, he not only confesses that Christ died even for infants, but
he also reproves us out of this admission, because we say that these
same infants are guilty for whom Christ died. Now, then, let the
apostle, who says that Christ was delivered up for us all, also tell us
why Christ was delivered up for us. “He was delivered,” says he, “for
our offences, and rose again for our justification.” <span
id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327) If, therefore, as even this man
both confesses and professes, both admits and objects, infants, too, are
included amongst those for whom Christ was delivered up; and if it was
for our sins that Christ was delivered up, even infants, of course, must
have original sins, for whom Christ was delivered up; He must have
something in them to heal, who (as Himself affirms) is not needed as a
Physician by the whole, but by the sick; <span
id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328) He must have a reason for saving
them, seeing that He came into the world, as the Apostle Paul says,
<span id="page_307">p. 307</span> <span
id="xvi.vi.lvii-Page_307"></span>“to save sinners;” <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329) He must have something in them to
remit, who testifies that He shed His blood “for the remission of
sins;” <span id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330) He must have good
reason for seeking them out, who “came,” as He says, “to seek and to
save that which was lost;” <span id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331)
the Son of man must find in them something to destroy, who came for the
express purpose, as the Apostle John says, “that He might destroy the
works of the devil.” <span id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332) Now to
this salvation of infants He must be an enemy, who asserts their
innocence, in such a way as to deny them the medicine which is required
by the hurt and wounded.
