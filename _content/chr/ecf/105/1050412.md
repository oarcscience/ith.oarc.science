<span id="xiv.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 27 \[XII.\]—The Eighth Item in the
Accusation.</span>

<span id="xiv.xxxi-p2"></span>Pelagius was charged with having said:
“That the Church here is without spot or wrinkle.” It was on this point
that the Donatists also were constantly at conflict with us in our
conference. We used, in their case, to lay especial stress on the
mixture of bad men with good, like that of the chaff with the wheat; and
we were led to this idea by the similitude of the threshing-floor. We
might apply the same illustration in answer to our present opponents,
unless indeed they would have the Church consist only of good men, whom
they assert to be without any sin whatever, that so the Church might be
without spot or wrinkle. If this be their meaning, then I repeat the
same words as I quoted just now; for how can they be members of the
Church, of whom the voice of a truthful humility declares, “If we say
that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us?” <span id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682) or how could the Church
offer up that prayer which the Lord taught her to use, “Forgive us our
debts,” <span id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683) if in this world the
Church is without a spot or blemish? In short, they must themselves
submit to be strictly catechised respecting themselves: do they really
allow that they have any sins of their own? If their answer is in the
negative, then they must be plainly told that they are deceiving
themselves, and the truth is not in them. If, however, they shall
acknowledge that they do commit sin, what is this but a confession of
their own wrinkle and spot? They therefore are not members of the
Church; because the Church is without spot and wrinkle, while they have
both spot and wrinkle.
