<span id="xv.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 \[III.\]—Grace According to the
Pelagians.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iii-p2"></span>But why should we wonder at this? For
the same Pelagius, who in the Proceedings of the episcopal synod
unhesitatingly condemned those who say “that God’s grace and assistance
are not given for single acts, but consist in free will, or in law and
teaching,” <span id="fr_1786"></span>[1787](#fn_1786) upon which points
we were apt to think that he had expended all his subterfuges; and who
also condemned such as affirm that the grace of God is bestowed in
proportion to our merits:—is proved, notwithstanding, to hold, in the
books which he has published on the freedom of the will, and which he
mentions in the letter he sent to Rome, no other sentiments than those
which he seemingly condemned. For that grace and help of God, by which
we are assisted in avoiding sin, he places either in nature and free
will, or else in the gift of the law and teaching; the result of which
of course is this, that whenever God helps a man, He must be supposed to
help him to turn away from evil and do good, by revealing to him and
teaching him what he ought to do, <span
id="fr_1787"></span>[1788](#fn_1787) but not with the additional
assistance of His co-operation and inspiration of love, that he may
accomplish that which he had discovered it to be his duty to do.

explanation of the terms “law” and “teaching,” which Pelagius uses
almost technically.
