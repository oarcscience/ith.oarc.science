<span id="xviii.v.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22.—Nature of Human Righteousness
and Perfection.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xxii-p2"></span>For from the place in which he
undertook to say these things, he thus began, “Beware of dogs, beware of
evil workers, beware of the concision. For we are the circumcision, who
serve God in the Spirit,”—or, as some codices have it, “who serve God
the Spirit,” or “the Spirit of God,”—“and glory in Christ Jesus, and
have no confidence in the flesh.” <span
id="fr_2759"></span>[2760](#fn_2759) Here it is manifest that he is
speaking against the Jews, who, observing the law carnally, and going
about to establish their own righteousness, were slain by the letter,
and not made alive by the Spirit, and gloried in themselves while the
apostles and all the children of the promise were glorying in Christ.
Then he added, “Although I may have confidence in the flesh. If any one
else thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I more.” <span
id="fr_2760"></span>[2761](#fn_2760) And enumerating all things which
have glory according to the flesh, he ended at that point where he says,
“According to the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.” And
when he had said that he regarded all these things as altogether loss
and disadvantage and dung that he might gain Christ, he added the
passage which I am treating, “And be found in Him, not having my own
righteousness, but that which is by the faith of Christ, which is from
God.” He confessed that he had not yet received the perfection of this
righteousness, which will not be except in that excellent knowledge of
Christ, on account of which he said that all things were loss to him;
and he confessed, therefore, that he was not yet perfect. “But I follow
on,” said he, “if I may apprehend that in which I also am apprehended of
Christ Jesus.” <span id="fr_2761"></span>[2762](#fn_2761) “I may
apprehend that in which I also am apprehended,” is much the same as, “I
may know, even as I also am known.” “Brethren,” says he, “I count not
myself to have apprehended: but one thing, forgetting those things which
are behind, and reaching forward to those which are before, I follow on
according to the purpose for the reward of the supreme calling of God in
Christ Jesus.” <span id="fr_2762"></span>[2763](#fn_2762) The order of
the words is, “But one thing I follow.” Of which one thing the Lord also
is well understood to have admonished Martha, where he says, “Martha,
Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: but one thing
is needful.” <span id="fr_2763"></span>[2764](#fn_2763) The apostle,
wishing to apprehend this as if set in the way, said that he followed on
to the reward of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. For who can
delay when he would apprehend that which he declares that he is
following, that he shall then have a righteousness equal to the
righteousness of the holy angels, none of whom, of course, does any
messenger of Satan buffet lest he should be lifted up with the greatness
of his revelations? Then, admonishing those who might think themselves
already perfect with the fulness of that righteousness, he says, “Let as
many of us, therefore, as are perfect, be thus minded.” <span
id="fr_2764"></span>[2765](#fn_2764) As if he should say, If, according
to the capacity of mortal man for the little measure of this life, we
are perfect, let us understand that it also belongs to that perfection
that we perceive that we are not yet perfected in that angelical
righteousness which we shall have in the manifestation of Christ. “And
if in anything,” he said, “ye be otherwise minded, God shall also reveal
even this unto you.” <span id="fr_2765"></span>[2766](#fn_2765) How,
save to those that are walking and advancing in the way of the faith,
until that wandering be finished and they come to the actual vision?
Whence following on, he added, “Nevertheless, whereunto we have already
attained, let us walk therein.” <span
id="fr_2766"></span>[2767](#fn_2766) Then he concludes that they should
be bewared of, concerning whom this passage treated at its beginning.
“Brethren, be imitators of me, and mark them which so walk as ye have
our example. For many walk, of whom I have spoken often, and now tell
you even weeping, whose end is destruction,” <span
id="fr_2767"></span>[2768](#fn_2767) and the rest. These are the very
ones of whom, in the beginning, he had said, “Beware of dogs, beware of
evil workers,” and what follows. Therefore all are enemies of the cross
of Christ who, going about to establish their own righteousness, which
is of the law,—that is, where only the letter commands, and the Spirit
does not fulfil,—are not subject to the law of God. For if they who are
of the law be heirs, faith is made an empty thing. “If righteousness is
by the law, then Christ has died in vain: then is the offence of the
cross done away.” And thus those are enemies of the cross of Christ who
say that righteousness is by the law, to which it belongs to command,
not to assist. But the grace of God through Jesus Christ the Lord in the
Holy Spirit helpeth our infirmity.
