<p><a name="xiii.xii-p2"></A>VIII. &#8220;Again, this question must be asked,&#8221; he says, &#8220;how God wishes man to be,&#8212;with sin, or without sin? Beyond doubt, He does not wish him to be with sin. We must reflect how great would be the impious blasphemy for it to be said that man has it in his power to be with sin, which God does not wish; and for it to be denied that he has it in his power to be without sin, which God wishes: just as if God had created any man for such a result as this,&#8212;that he should be able to be what He would not have him, and unable to be what He would have him; and that he should lead an existence contrary to His will, rather than one which should be in accordance therewith.&#8221; This has been in fact already answered; but I see that it is necessary for me to make here an additional remark, that we are saved by hope. &#8220;But hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1376"></A><A HREF="#fn_1376"><FONT SIZE="1">1377</FONT></A>
 Full righteousness, therefore, will only then be reached, when fulness of health is attained; and this fulness of health shall be when there is fulness of love, for &#8220;love is the fulfilling of the law;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1377"></A><A HREF="#fn_1377"><FONT SIZE="1">1378</FONT></A>
 and then shall come fulness of love, when &#8220;we shall see Him even as He is.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1378"></A><A HREF="#fn_1378"><FONT SIZE="1">1379</FONT></A>
 Nor will any addition to love be possible more, when faith shall have reached the fruition of sight.</p>
