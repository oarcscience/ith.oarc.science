<span id="x.iii.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 58 \[XXX.\]—In What Respect the
Pelagians Regarded Baptism as Necessary for Infants.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lviii-p2"></span>Let us now examine more carefully, so
far as the Lord enables us, that very chapter of the Gospel where He
says, “Except a man be born again,—of water and the Spirit,— he shall
not enter into the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413) If it were not for the authority which
this sentence has with them, they would not be of opinion that infants
ought to be baptized at all. This is their comment on the passage:
“Because He does not say, ‘Except a man be born again of water <span
id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span id="x.iii.lviii-Page_38"></span>and the
Spirit, he shall not have salvation or eternal life,’ but He merely
said, ‘he shall not enter into the kingdom of God,’ therefore infants
are to be baptized, in order that they may be with Christ in the kingdom
of God, where they will not be unless they are baptized. Should infants
die, however, even without baptism, they will have salvation and eternal
life, seeing that they are bound with no fetter of sin.” Now in such a
statement as this, the first thing that strikes one is, that they never
explain *where the justice is* of separating from the kingdom of God
that “image of God” which has no sin. Next, we ought to see whether the
Lord Jesus, the one only good Teacher, has not in this very passage of
the Gospel intimated, and indeed shown us, that it only comes to pass
through the remission of their sins that baptized persons reach the
kingdom of God; although to persons of a right understanding, the words,
as they stand in the passage, ought to be sufficiently explicit: “Except
a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God;” <span
id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414) and: “Except a man be born of water
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415) For why should he be born again,
unless to be renewed? From what is he to be renewed, if not from some
old condition? From what old condition, but that in which “our old man
is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed?” <span
id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416) Or whence comes it to pass that “the
image of God” enters not into the kingdom of God, unless it be that the
impediment of sin prevents it? However, let us (as we said before) see,
as earnestly and diligently as we are able, what is the entire context
of this passage of the Gospel, on the point in question.
