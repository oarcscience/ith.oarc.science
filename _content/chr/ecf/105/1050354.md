<span id="xiii.xxii-p1"></span><span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxii-p1.1"></span>(18.) The Righteousness of This Life
Comprehended in Three Parts,—Fasting, Almsgiving, and Prayer.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxii-p2"></span>As long, then, as we are “absent from the
Lord, we walk by faith, not by sight;” <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411) whence it is said, “The just shall
live by faith.” <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412) Our
righteousness in this pilgrimage is this—that we press forward to that
perfect and full righteousness in which there shall be perfect and full
love in the sight of His glory; and that now we hold to the rectitude
and perfection of our course, by “keeping under our body and bringing it
into subjection,” <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413) by doing
our alms cheerfully and heartily, while bestowing kindnesses and
forgiving the trespasses which have been committed against us, and by
“continuing instant in prayer;” <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414) —and doing all this with sound
doctrine, whereon are built a right faith, a firm hope, and a pure
charity. This is now our righteousness, in which we pass through our
course hungering and thirsting after the perfect and full righteousness,
in order that we may hereafter be satisfied therewith. Therefore our
Lord in the Gospel (after saying, “Take heed that ye do not your
righteousness <span id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415) before men, to
be seen of them,” <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416) ) in order
that we should not measure our course of life by the limit of human
glory, declared in his exposition of righteousness itself that there is
none except there be these three,—fasting, alms, prayers. Now in *the
fasting* He indicates the entire subjugation of the body; in *the alms*,
all kindness of will and deed, either by giving or forgiving; and in
*prayers* He implies all the rules of a holy desire. So that, although
by the subjugation of the body a check is given to that concupiscence,
which ought not only to be bridled but to be put altogether out of
existence (and which will not be found at all in that state of perfect
righteousness, where sin shall be absolutely excluded),—yet it often
exerts its immoderate desire even in the use of things which are
allowable and right. In that real beneficence in which the just man
consults his neighbour’s welfare, things are sometimes done which are
prejudicial, although it was thought that they would be advantageous.
Sometimes, too, through infirmity, when the amount of the kindness and
trouble which is expended either falls short of the necessities of the
objects, or is of little use under the circumstances, then there steals
over us a disappointment which tarnishes that “cheerfulness” which
secures to the “giver” the approbation of God. <span
id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417) This trail of sadness, however, is
the greater or the less, as each man has made more or less progress in
his kindly purposes. If, then, these considerations, and such as these,
be duly weighed, we are only right when we say in our prayers, “Forgive
us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.” <span
id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418) But what we say in our prayers we
must carry into <span id="page_165">p. 165</span> <span
id="xiii.xxii-Page_165"></span>act, even to loving our very enemies; or
if any one who is still a babe in Christ fails as yet to reach this
point, he must at any rate, whenever one who has trespassed against him
repents and craves his pardon, exercise forgiveness from the bottom of
his heart, if he would have his heavenly Father listen to his prayer.
