<p class="c46"><a name="xix.iv.xi-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xix.iv.xi-p1.1"></A>Chapter 11.&#8212;Other Passages of Scripture Which the Pelagians Abuse.</span></p>  
<p><a name="xix.iv.xi-p2"></A>Then, again, there is the Scripture contained in the second book of the Chronicles: &#8220;The Lord is with you when ye are with Him: and if ye shall seek Him ye shall find Him; but if ye forsake Him, He also will forsake you.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3016"></A><A HREF="#fn_3016"><FONT SIZE="1">3017</FONT></A>
 This passage, no doubt, clearly manifests the choice of the will. But they who maintain that God&#146;s grace is given according to our merits, receive these testimonies of Scripture in such a manner as to believe that our merit lies in the circumstance of our &#8220;being with God,&#8221; while His grace is given according to this merit, so that He too may be with us. In like manner, that our merit lies in the fact of &#8220;our seeking God,&#8221; and then His grace is given according to this merit, in order that we may find Him.&#8221; Again, there is a passage in the first book of the same Chronicles which declares the choice of the will: &#8220;And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind, for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts; if thou seek Him, He will be found of thee; but if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off for ever.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3017"></A><A HREF="#fn_3017"><FONT SIZE="1">3018</FONT></A>
 But these people find some room for human merit in the clause, &#8220;If thou seek Him,&#8221; and then the grace is thought to be given according to this merit in what is said in the ensuing words, &#8220;He will be found of thee.&#8221; And so they labour with all their might to show that God&#146;s grace is given according to our merits,&#8212;in other words, that grace is not grace. For, as the apostle most expressly says, to them who receive reward according to merit &#8220;the recompense is not reckoned of grace but of debt.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3018"></A><A HREF="#fn_3018"><FONT SIZE="1">3019</FONT></A>
