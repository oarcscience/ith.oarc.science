id="xvi.vi.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 37 \[XXII.\]—If There is No
Marriage Without Cohabitation, So There is No Cohabitation Without
Shame.</span>

<span id="xvi.vi.xxxviii-p2"></span>“Show me,” he says, “any bodily
marriage without sexual connection.” I do not show him any bodily
marriage without sexual connection; but then, neither does he show me
any case of sexual connection which is without shame. In paradise,
however, if sin had not preceded, there would not have been, indeed,
generation without union of the sexes, but this union would certainly
have been without shame; for in the sexual union there would have been a
quiet acquiescence of the members, not a lust of the flesh productive of
shame. Matrimony, therefore, is a good, in which the human being is born
after orderly conception; the fruit, too, of matrimony is good, as being
the very human being which is thus born; sin, however, is an evil with
which every man is born. Now it was God who made and still makes man;
but “by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so
death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned.” <span
