id="xv.iv.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 36 \[XXXI\]—The Platonists’ Opinion
About the Existence of the Soul Previous to the Body Rejected.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxxvi-p2"></span>What, then, is the purport of so severe
a condemnation, when no wilful sin has been committed? For it is not as
certain Platonists have thought, because every such infant is thus
requited in his soul for what it did of its own wilfulness previous to
the present life, as having possessed previous to its present bodily
state a free choice of living either well or ill; since the Apostle Paul
says most plainly, that before they were born they did neither good nor
evil. <span id="fr_2005"></span>[2006](#fn_2005) On what account,
therefore, is an infant rightly punished with such ruin, if it be not
because he belongs to the mass of perdition, and is properly regarded as
born of Adam, condemned under the bond of the ancient debt unless he has
been released from the bond, not according to debt, but according to
grace? And what grace but God’s, through our Lord Jesus Christ? Now
there was a forecast of His coming undoubtedly contained not only in
other sacred institutions  <span id="fr_2006"></span>[2007](#fn_2006) of
the ancient Jews, but also in their circumcision of the foreskin. For
the eighth day, in the recurrence of weeks, became the Lord’s day, on
which the Lord arose from the dead; and Christ was the rock <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007) whence was formed the stony blade
for the circumcision; <span id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008) and the
flesh of the foreskin was the body of sin.
