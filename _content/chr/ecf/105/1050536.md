id="xv.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 25 \[XXII.\]—The Condemnation of
Pelagius and Cœlestius.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxv-p2"></span>These things, then, being as I have
stated them, it is now evident that there has arisen a deadly heresy,
which, with the Lord’s help, the Church by this time guards against more
directly—now that those two men, Pelagius and Cœlestius, have been
either offered repentance, or on their refusal been wholly condemned.
They are reported, or perhaps actually proved, to be the authors of this
perversion; at all events, if not the authors (as having learnt it from
others), they are yet its boasted abettors and teachers, through whose
agency the heresy has advanced and grown to a wider extent. This boast,
too, is made even in their own statements and writings, and in
unmistakeable signs of reality, as well as in the fame which arises and
grows out of all these circumstances. What, therefore, remains to be
done? Must not every catholic, with all the energies wherewith the Lord
endows him, confute this pestilential doctrine, and oppose it with all
vigilance; so that whenever we contend for the truth, compelled to
answer, but not fond of the contest, the untaught may be instructed, and
that thus the Church may be benefited by that which the enemy devised
for her destruction; in accordance with that word of the apostle’s,
“There must be heresies, that they which are approved may be made
manifest among you”? <span id="fr_1952"></span>[1953](#fn_1952)
