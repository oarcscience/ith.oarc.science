<span id="xviii.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.—What is the Special Advantage in
the Pelagian Opinions?</span>

<span id="xviii.vi.v-p2"></span>What advantage, then, is it to them that
they say “that all sin descends not from nature, but from the will,” and
resist by the truth of this judgment the Manicheans, who say that evil
nature is the cause of sin; when by being unwilling to admit original
sin although itself also descends from the will of the first man, they
make infants to depart in guilt from the body? What advantage is it to
them “that they confess <span id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span
id="xviii.vi.v-Page_419"></span>that baptism is necessary for all ages,”
while the Manicheans say that it is superfluous for every age, while
they say that in infants it is false so far as it pertains to the
forgiveness of sins? What advantage is it to them that they maintain
“the flesh of Christ” (which the Manicheans contend was either no flesh
at all, or a feigned flesh) to have been not only the true flesh, but
also “that the soul itself was stained by no spot of sin,” when other
infants are by them so put on the same level with His infancy, with not
unequal purity, as that both that flesh does not appear to keep its own
holiness in comparison with these, and these obtain no salvation from
that?
