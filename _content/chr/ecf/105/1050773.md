id="xvii.vii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 17 \[XII.\]—A Twofold Question to
Be Treated Concerning the Soul; Is It “Body”? and is It “Spirit”? What
Body is.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xvii-p2"></span>And now, as far as the Lord
vouchsafes to enable me, I must reply also to that allegation of yours,
in which, speaking of the soul, you again mention my name, and say, “We
do not, as the very able and learned bishop Augustin professes, allow it
to be incorporeal and also a spirit.” We have therefore, first, to
discuss the question, whether the soul is to be deemed incorporeal, as I
have said; or corporeal, as you hold. Then, secondly, whether in our
Scriptures it is called a spirit—although not the whole but its own
separate part is also properly called spirit. <span
id="fr_2477"></span>[2478](#fn_2477) Well, I should, to begin with, like
to know how you define *body.* For if that is not “body” which does not
consist of limbs of flesh, then the earth cannot be a body, nor the sky,
nor a stone, nor water, nor the stars, nor anything of the kind. If,
however, a “body” is whatever consists of parts, whether greater or
less, which occupy greater or smaller local spaces, then all the things
which I have just mentioned are bodies; the air is a body; the visible
light is a body; and so are all the things which the apostle has in
view, when he says, “There are celestial bodies, and bodies
terrestrial.” <span id="fr_2478"></span>[2479](#fn_2478)
