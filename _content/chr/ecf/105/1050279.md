<span id="xii.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 32 \[XXVIII.\]—God Forsakes Us to
Some Extent that We May Not Grow Proud.</span>

<span id="xii.xxxvi-p2"></span>Therefore it is not said to a man: “It
necessary for you to sin that you may not sin;” but it is said to a man:
“God in some degree forsakes you, in consequence of which you grow
proud, that you may know that you are ‘not your own,’ but are His, <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207) and learn not to be proud.” Now
even that incident in the apostle’s life, of this kind, is so wonderful,
that were it not for the fact that he himself is the voucher for it
whose truth it is impious to contradict, would it not be incredible? For
what believer is there who is ignorant that the first incentive to sin
came from Satan, and that he is the first author of all sins? And yet,
for all that, some are “delivered over unto Satan, that they may learn
not to blaspheme.”  <span id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208) How comes
it to pass, then, that Satan’s work is prevented by the work of Satan?
These and such like questions let a man regard in such a light that they
seem not to him to be too acute; they have somewhat of the sound of
acuteness, and yet when discussed are found to be obtuse. What must we
say also to our author’s use of similes whereby he rather suggests to us
the answer which we should give to him? “What” (asks he) “shall I say
more than this, that we may believe that fires are quenched by fires, if
we may believe that sins are cured by sins?” What if one cannot put out
fires by fires: but yet pains can, for all that, as I have shown, be
cured by pains? Poisons can also, if one only inquire and learn the
fact, be expelled by poisons. Now, if he observes that the heats of
fevers are sometimes subdued by certain medicinal warmths, he will
perhaps also allow that fires may be extinguished by fires.
