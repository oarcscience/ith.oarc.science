<span id="xv.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[V.\]—Pelagius and Paul of
Different Opinions.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.vi-p2"></span>The whole of this dogma of Pelagius,
observe, is carefully expressed in these words, and none other, in the
third book of his treatise in defence of the liberty of the will, in
which he has taken care to distinguish with so great subtlety these
three things,—the “capacity,” the “volition,” and the “action,” that is,
the “ability,” the “volition,” and the “actuality,”—that, whenever we
read or hear of his acknowledging the assistance of divine grace in
order to our avoidance of evil and accomplishment of good,—whatever he
may mean by the said assistance of grace, whether law and the teaching
or any other thing,—we are sure of what he says; nor can we run into any
mistake by understanding him otherwise than he means. For we cannot help
knowing that, according to his belief, it is not our “volition” nor our
“action” which is assisted by the divine help, but solely our “capacity”
to will and act, which alone of the three, as he affirms, we have of
God. As if that faculty were infirm which God Himself placed in our
nature; while the other two, which, as he would have it, are our own,
are so strong and firm and self-sufficient as to require none of His
help! so that He does not help us to will, nor help us to act, but
simply helps us to the possibility of willing and acting. The apostle,
however, holds the contrary, when he says, “Work out your own salvation
with fear and trembling.” <span id="fr_1790"></span>[1791](#fn_1790) And
that they might be sure that it was not simply in their being able to
work (for this they had already received in nature and in teaching), but
in their actual working, that they were divinely assisted, the apostle
does not say to them, “For it is God that worketh in you to be able,” as
if they already possessed volition and operation among their own
resources, without requiring His assistance in respect of these two; but
he says, “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to perform
of His own good pleasure;” <span id="fr_1791"></span>[1792](#fn_1791)
or, as the reading runs in other copies, especially the Greek, “both to
will and to operate.” Consider, now, whether the apostle did not thus
long before foresee by the Holy Ghost that there would arise adversaries
of the grace of God; and did not therefore declare that God works within
us those two very things, even “willing” and “operating,” which this man
so determined to be our own, as if they were in no wise assisted by the
help of divine grace.
