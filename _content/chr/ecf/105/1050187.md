<span id="xi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11 \[VII.\]—From What Fountain Good
Works Flow.</span>

<span id="xi.xiv-p2"></span>This holy meditation preserves “the children
of men, who put their trust under the shadow of God’s wings,” <span
id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735) so that they are “drunken with the
fatness of His house, and drink of the full stream of His pleasure. For
with Him is the fountain of life, and in His light shall they see light.
For He extendeth His mercy to them that know Him, and His righteousness
to the upright in heart.” <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736) He
does not, indeed, extend His mercy to them because they know Him, but
that they may know Him; nor is it because they are upright in heart, but
that they may become so, that He extends to them His righteousness,
whereby He justifies the ungodly. <span
id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737) This meditation does not elevate with
pride: this sin arises when any man has too much confidence in himself,
and makes himself the chief end of living. Impelled by this vain
feeling, he departs from that fountain of life, from the draughts of
which alone is imbibed the holiness which is itself the good life,—and
from that unchanging light, by sharing in which the reasonable soul is
in a certain sense inflamed, and becomes itself a created and reflected
luminary; even as “John was a burning and a shining light,” <span
id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738) who notwithstanding acknowledged the
source of his own illumination in the words, “Of His fulness have all we
received.” <span id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739) Whose, I would ask,
but His, of course, in comparison with whom John indeed was no light at
all? For “that was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh
into the world.” <span id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740) Therefore, in
the same psalm, after saying, “Extend Thy mercy to them that know Thee,
and Thy righteousness to the upright in heart,” <span
id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741) he adds, “Let not the foot of pride
come against me, and let not the hands of sinners move me. There have
fallen all the workers of iniquity: they are cast out, and are not able
to stand.” <span id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742) Since by that impiety
which leads each to attribute to himself the excellence which is God’s,
he is cast out into his own native darkness, in which consist the works
of iniquity. For it is manifestly these works which he does, and for the
achievement of such alone is he naturally fit. The works of
righteousness he never does, except as he receives ability from that
fountain and that light, where the life is that wants for nothing, and
where is “no variableness, nor the shadow of turning.” <span
id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743)
