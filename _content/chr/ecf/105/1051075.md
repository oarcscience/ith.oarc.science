<span id="xxi.ii.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39—The Beginning of Faith is God’s
Gift.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.xxxix-p2"></span>Finally, also, in what follows this
testimony, the apostle gives thanks to God on behalf of those who have
believed;—not, certainly, because the gospel has been declared to them,
but because they have believed. For he says, “In whom also after ye had
heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also,
after that ye believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
which is the pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of the
purchased possession unto the praise of His glory. Wherefore I also,
after I had heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and with reference to
all the saints, cease not to give thanks for you.” <span
id="fr_3536"></span>[3537](#fn_3536) Their faith was new and recent on
the preaching of the gospel to them, which faith when he hears of, the
apostle gives thanks to God on their behalf. If he were to give thanks
to man for that which he might either think or know that man had not
given, it would be called a flattery or a mockery, rather than a giving
of thanks. “Do not err, for God is not mocked;” <span
id="fr_3537"></span>[3538](#fn_3537) for His gift is also the beginning
of faith, unless the apostolic giving of thanks be rightly judged to be
either mistaken or fallacious. What then? Does that not appear as the
beginning of the faith of the Thessalonians, for which, nevertheless,
the same apostle gives thanks to God when he says, “For this cause also
we thank God without ceasing, because when ye had received from us the
word of the hearing of God, ye received it not as the word of men, but
as it is in truth the word of God, which effectually worketh in you and
which ye believed”? <span id="fr_3538"></span>[3539](#fn_3538) What is
that for which he here gives thanks to God? Assuredly it is a vain and
idle thing if He to whom he gives thanks did not Himself do the thing.
But, since this is not a vain and idle thing, certainly God, to whom he
gave thanks concerning this work, Himself did it; that when they had
received the word of the hearing of God, they received it not as the
word of men, but as it is in truth the word of God. God, therefore,
worketh in the hearts of men with that calling according to His purpose,
of which we have spoken a great deal, that they should not hear the
gospel in vain, but when they heard it, should be converted and believe,
receiving it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth the word of
God.
