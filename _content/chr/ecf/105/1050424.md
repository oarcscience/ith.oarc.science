<span id="xiv.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39 \[XVI.\]—The Same Continued. Heros
and Lazarus; Orosius.</span>

<span id="xiv.xliii-p2"></span>Now there are some expositions of Paul’s
Epistle to the Romans which are said to have been written by Pelagius
himself, <span id="fr_1732"></span>[1733](#fn_1732) —in which he
asserts, that the passage: “Not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,” was “not said in Paul’s own
person; but that he therein employed the language of questioning and
refutation, as if such a statement ought not to be made.” No safe
conclusion, therefore, can be drawn, although the bishop John plainly
acknowledged the passage in question as conveying the mind of the
apostle, and mentioned it for the very purpose of hindering Pelagius
from thinking that any man can avoid sin without God’s grace, and
declared that Pelagius said in answer: “This is what I also believe,”
and did not, upon hearing all this, repudiate his admission by replying:
“This is not my belief.” He ought, indeed, either to deny altogether, or
unhesitatingly to correct and amend <span id="page_201">p. 201</span>
<span id="xiv.xliii-Page_201"></span>this perverse exposition, in which
he would have it, that the apostle must not be regarded as entertaining
the sentiment,  <span id="fr_1733"></span>[1734](#fn_1733) but rather as
refuting it. Now, whatever Bishop John said of our brethren who were
absent—whether our brother bishops Heros and Lazarus, or the presbyter
Orosius, or any others whose names are not there registered, <span
id="fr_1734"></span>[1735](#fn_1734) —I am sure that he did not mean it
to operate to their prejudice. For, had they been present, they might
possibly (I am far from saying it absolutely) have convicted him of
untruth; at any rate they might perhaps have reminded him of something
he had forgotten, or something in which he might have been deceived by
the Latin interpreter—not, to be sure, for the purpose of misleading him
by untruth, but at least, owing to some difficulty occasioned by a
foreign language, only imperfectly understood; especially as the
question was not treated in the Proceedings, <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735) which were drawn up for the useful
purpose of preventing deceit on the part of evil men, and of preserving
a record to assist the memory of good men. If, however, any man shall be
disposed by this mention of our brethren to introduce any question or
doubt on the subject, and summon them before the Episcopal judgment,
they will not be wanting to themselves, as occasion shall serve. Why
need we here pursue the point, when not even the judges themselves,
after the narrative of our brother bishop, were inclined to pronounce
any definite sentence in consequence of it?
