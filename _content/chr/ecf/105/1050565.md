<span id="xvi.v-p9"></span>Wherein He expounds the peculiar and natural
blessings of marriage. He shows that among these blessings must not be
reckoned fleshly concupiscence; insomuch as this is wholly evil, such as
does not proceed from the very nature of marriage, but is an accident
thereof arising from original sin. This evil, notwithstanding, is
rightly employed by marriage for the procreation of children. But, as
the result of this concupiscence, it comes to pass that, even from the
lawful marriage of the children of God, men are not born children of
God, but of the world, and are bound with the chain of sin, although
their parents have been liberated therefrom by grace; and are led
captive by the devil, if they be not in like manner rescued by the
self-same grace of Christ. He explains how it is that concupiscence
remains in the baptized in act though not in guilt. He teaches, that by
the sanctity of baptism, not merely this original guilt, but all other
sins of men whatever, are taken away. He lastly quotes the authority of
Ambrose to show that the evil of concupiscence must be distinguished
from the good of marriage.
