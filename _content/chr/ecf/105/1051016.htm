<p class="c46"><a name="xx.xxxv-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xx.xxxv-p1.1"></A>Chapter 32.&#8212;The Gifts of Grace Conferred on Adam in Creation.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xx.xxxv-p2"></A>At that time, therefore, God had given to man a good will,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3354"></A><A HREF="#fn_3354"><FONT SIZE="1">3355</FONT></A>
 because in that will He had made him, since He had made him upright. He had given help without which he could not continue therein if he would; but that he should will, He left in his free will. He could therefore continue if he would, because the help was not wanting whereby he could, and without which he could not, perseveringly hold fast the good which he would. But that he willed not to continue is absolutely the fault of him whose merit it would have been if he had willed to continue; as the holy angels did, who, while others fell by free will, themselves by the same free will stood, and deserved to receive the due reward of this continuance&#8212;to wit, such a fulness of blessing that by it they might have the fullest certainty of always abiding in it. If, however, this help <A NAME="page_485"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 485</FONT></A> <a name="xx.xxxv-Page_485"></A>had been wanting, either to angel or to man when they were first made, since their nature was not made such that without the divine help it could abide if it would, they certainly would not have fallen by their own fault, because the help would have been wanting without which they could not continue. At the present time, however, to those to whom such assistance is wanting, it is the penalty of sin; but to those to whom it is given, it is given of grace, not of debt; and by so much the more is given through Jesus Christ our Lord to those to whom it has pleased God to give it, that not only we have that help without which we cannot continue even if we will, but, moreover, we have so great and such a help as to <i>will.</i> Because by this grace of God there is caused in us, in the reception of good and in the persevering hold of it, not only to be able to do what we will, but even to will to do what we are able. But this was not the case in the first man; for the one of these things was in him, but the other was not. For he did not need grace to receive good, because he had not yet lost it; but he needed the aid of grace to continue in it, and without this aid he could not do this at all; and he had received the ability if he would, but he had not the will for what he could; for if he had possessed it, he would have persevered. For he could persevere if he would; but that he would not was the result of free will, which at that time was in such wise free that he was capable of willing well and ill. For what shall be more free than free will, when it shall not be able to serve sin? and this should be to man also as it was made to the holy angels, the reward of deserving. But now that good deserving has been lost by sin, in those who are delivered that has become the gift of grace which would have been the reward of deserving.</p>
