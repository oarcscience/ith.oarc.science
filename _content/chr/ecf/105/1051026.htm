<p><a name="xx.xlv-p2"></A>But those who do not belong to this number of the predestinated, whom&#8212;whether that they have not yet any free choice of their will, or with a choice of will truly free, because freed by grace itself&#8212;the grace of God brings to His kingdom,&#8212;those, then, who do not belong to that most certain and blessed number, are most righteously judged according to their deservings. For either they lie under the sin which they have inherited by original generation, and depart hence with that inherited debt which is not put away by regeneration, or by their free will have added other sins besides; their will, I say, <i> free</i>, but not <i>freed</i>,&#8212;free from righteousness, but enslaved to sin, by which they are tossed about by divers mischievous lusts, some more evil, some less, but all evil; and they must be adjudged to diverse punishments, according to that very diversity. Or they receive the grace of God, but they are only for a season, and do not persevere; they forsake and are forsaken. For by their free will, as they have not received the gift of perseverance, they are sent away by the righteous and hidden judgment of God.</p>
