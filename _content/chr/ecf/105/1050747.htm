<p><a name="xvii.vi.xv-p2"></A>If you wish to be a catholic, I pray you, neither believe, nor say, nor teach that &#8220;there are some mansions outside the kingdom of God which the Lord said were in His Father&#146;s house.&#8221; For He does not affirm, as you have adduced his testimony, &#8220;There are with my Father (<i>apud Patrem meum</i>) many mansions;&#8221; although, if He had even expressed Himself so, the mansions could hardly be supposed to have any other situation than <i>in the house</i> of His Father; but He plainly says, &#8220;In my Father&#146;s house are many mansions.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2448"></A><A HREF="#fn_2448"><FONT SIZE="1">2449</FONT></A>
 Now, who would be so reckless as to separate some parts of God&#146;s house from the kingdom of God; so that, whilst the kings of the earth are found reigning, not in their house only, nor only in their own country, but far and wide, even in regions across the sea, the King who made the heaven and the earth is not described as reigning even over all His own house?</p>
