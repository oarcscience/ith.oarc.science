<span id="xviii.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 6 \[III.\]—Grace is Not Given
According to Merits.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.vi-p2"></span>But lest perchance they say that they
are aided to this,—that they may “have power to become the sons of God,”
but that they may deserve to receive this power they have first
“received Him” by free will with no assistance of grace (because this is
the purpose of their endeavour to destroy grace, that they may contend
that it is given according to our deservings); lest perchance, then,
they so divide that evangelical statement as to refer merit to that
portion of it wherein it is said, “But as many as received Him,” and
then say that in that which follows, “He gave them power to become the
sons of God,” grace is not given freely, but is repaid to this merit; if
it is asked of them what is the meaning of “received Him,” will they say
anything else than “believed on Him”? And in order, therefore, that they
may know that this also pertains to grace, let them read what the
apostle says: “And that ye be in nothing terrified by your adversaries,
which indeed is to them a cause of perdition, but of your salvation, and
that of God; for unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only
to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.” <span
id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533) Certainly he said that both were
given. Let them read what he said also: “Peace be to the brethren, and
love, with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” <span
id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534) Let them also read what the Lord
Himself says: “No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me
shall draw him.” <span id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535) Where, lest
any one should suppose that anything else is said in the words “come to
me” than “believe in me,” a little after, when He was speaking of His
body and blood, and many were offended at His discourse, He says, “The
words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and life; but there are
some of you which believe not.” <span
id="fr_2536"></span>[2537](#fn_2536) Then the Evangelist added, “For
Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed, and who
should betray Him. And He said, Therefore I said unto you that no man
can come unto me except it were given him of my Father.” <span
id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537) He repeated, to wit, the saying in
which He had said, “No man can come unto me, except the Father who hath
sent me shall draw him.” And He declared that He said this for the sake
of believers and unbelievers, explaining what He had said, “except the
Father who hath sent me shall draw him,” by repeating the very same
thing in other words in that which He said, “except it were given him of
my Father.” Because he is drawn to Christ to whom it is given to believe
on Christ. Therefore the power is given that they who believe on Him
should become the sons of God, since this very thing is given, that they
believe on Him. And unless this power be given from God, out of free
will there can be none; because it will not be free for good if the
deliverer have not made it free; but in evil he has a free will in whom
a deceiver, either secret or manifest, has grafted the love of
wickedness, or he himself has persuaded himself of it.
