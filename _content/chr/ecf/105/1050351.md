<span id="xiii.xix-p2"></span>XV. “And this, moreover, has to be said,”
he says: “God is certainly righteous; this cannot be denied. But God
imputes every sin to man. This too, I suppose, must be allowed, that
whatever shall not be imputed as sin is not sin. Now if there is any sin
which is unavoidable, how is God said to be righteous, when He is
supposed to impute to any man that which cannot be avoided?” We reply,
that long ago was it declared in opposition to the proud, “Blessed is
the man to whom the Lord imputeth not sin.” <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404) Now He does not impute it to those
who say to Him in faith, “Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our <span

id="xiii.xix-Page_164"></span>debtors.” <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405) And justly does He withhold this
imputation, because that is just which He says: “With what measure ye
mete, it shall be measured to you again.” <span
id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406) That, however, is sin in which
there is either not the love which ought to be, or where the love is
less than it ought to be, <span id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407)
—whether it can be avoided by the human will or not; because when it can
be avoided, the man’s present will does it, but if it cannot be avoided
his past will did it; and yet it can be avoided,—not, however, when the
proud will is lauded, but when the humble one is assisted.
