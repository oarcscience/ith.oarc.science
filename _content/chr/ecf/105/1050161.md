<span id="x.v.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.v.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12 \[VI.\]—The Universal Consensus
Respecting Original Sin.</span>

<span id="x.v.xii-p2"></span>And now, again, with a strange boldness in
new controversy, certain persons are endeavouring to make us uncertain
on a point which our forefathers used to bring forward as most certainly
fixed, whenever they would solve such questions as seemed uncertain to
some. When this controversy, indeed, first began, I am unable to say;
but one thing I know, that even the holy Jerome, who is in our own day
renowned for great industry and learning in ecclesiastical literature,
for the solution of sundry questions treated in his writings, makes use
of the same most certain assumption without exhibition of proofs. For
instance, in his commentary on the prophet Jonah, when he comes to the
passage where the infants were mentioned as chastened by the fast, he
says: <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672) “The greatest age comes
first, and then all the rest is pervaded down to the least. <span
id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673) For there is no man without sin,
whether the span of his age be but that of a single day, or he reckon
many years to his life. For if the very stars are unclean in the sight
of God, <span id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674) how much more is a worm
and corruption, such as are they who are held subject to the sin of the
offending Adam?” If, indeed, we could readily interrogate this most
learned man, how many authors who have treated of the divine Scriptures.
in both languages, <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675) and have
written on Christian controversies, would he mention to us, who have
never held any other opinion since the Church of Christ was founded,—who
neither received any other from their forefathers, nor handed down any
other to their posterity? My own reading, indeed, has been far more
limited, but yet I do not recollect ever having heard of any other
doctrine on this point from Christians, who accept the two Testaments,
whether established in the Catholic Church, or in any heretical or
schismatic body whatever. I do not remember, I say, that I have at any
time found any other doctrine in such writers as have contributed
anything to literature of this kind, whether they have followed the
canonical Scriptures, or have supposed that they have followed them, or
had wished to be so supposed. From what quarter this question has
suddenly come upon us I know not. A short time ago, <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676) in a passing conversation with certain
persons while we were at Carthage, my ears were suddenly offended with
such a proposition as this: “That infants are not baptized for the
purpose of receiving remission of sin, but that they may be sanctified
in Christ.” Although I was much disturbed by so novel an opinion, still,
as there was no opportunity afforded me for gainsaying it, and as its
propounders were not persons whose influence gave me anxiety, I readily
let the subject slip into neglect and oblivion. And lo! it is now
maintained with burning zeal against the Church; lo! it is committed to
our permanent notice by writing; nay, the matter is brought to such a
pitch of distracting influence, that we are even consulted on it by
<span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span id="x.v.xii-Page_74"></span>our
brethren; and we are actually obliged to oppose its progress both by
disputation and by writing.
