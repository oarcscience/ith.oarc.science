<span id="xxi.iii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[IX.\]—Instances of the
Unsearchable Judgments of God.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>Therefore, of two infants, equally
bound by original sin, why the one is taken and the other left; and of
two wicked men of already mature years, why this one should be so called
as to follow Him that calleth, while that one is either not called at
all, or is not called in such a manner,—the judgments of God are
unsearchable. But of two pious men, why to the one should be given
perseverance unto the end, and to the other it should not be given,
God’s judgments are even more unsearchable. Yet to believers it ought to
be a most certain fact that the former is of the predestinated, the
latter is not. “For if they had been of us,” says one of the
predestinated, who had drunk this secret from the breast of the Lord,
“certainly they would have continued with us.” <span
id="fr_3603"></span>[3604](#fn_3603) What, I ask, is the meaning of,
“They were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would certainly
have continued with us”? Were not both created by God—both born of
Adam—both made from the earth, and given from Him who said, “I have
created all breath,” <span id="fr_3604"></span>[3605](#fn_3604) souls of
one and the same nature? Lastly, had not both been called, and followed
Him that called them? and had not both become, from wicked men,
justified men, and both been renewed by the laver of regeneration? But
if he were to hear this who beyond all doubt knew what he was saying, he
might answer and say: These things are true. In respect of all these
things, they were of us. Nevertheless, in respect of a certain other
distinction, they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they
certainly would have continued with us. What then is this distinction?
God’s books lie <span id="page_533">p. 533</span> <span
id="xxi.iii.xxiii-Page_533"></span>open, let us not turn away our view;
the divine Scripture cries aloud, let us give it a hearing. They were
not of them, because they had not been “called according to the
purpose;” they had not been chosen in Christ before the foundation of
the world; they had not gained a lot in Him; they had not been
predestinated according to His purpose who worketh all things. For if
they had been this, they would have been of them, and without doubt they
would have continued with them.
