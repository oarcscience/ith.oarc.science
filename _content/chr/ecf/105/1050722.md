<span id="xvii.v.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 14 \[X.\]—Victor Sends Those Infants
Who Die Unbaptized to Paradise and the Heavenly Mansions, But Not to the
Kingdom of Heaven.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.xiv-p2"></span>But I beg you mark how bold he is, who
is displeased with hesitancy, which prefers to be cautious rather than
overknowing in a question so profound as this: “I would be bold to
say”—such are his words—“that they can attain to the forgiveness of
their original sins, yet not so as to be admitted into the kingdom of
heaven. Just as in the case of the thief on the cross, who confessed but
was not baptized, the Lord did not give him the kingdom of heaven, but
paradise;  <span id="fr_2411"></span>[2412](#fn_2411) the words
remaining accordingly in full force, ‘Except a man be born again of
water and of the Holy Ghost, he shall not enter into the kingdom of
heaven.’ <span id="fr_2412"></span>[2413](#fn_2412) This is especially
true, inasmuch as the Lord acknowledges that in His Father’s house are
many mansions, <span id="fr_2413"></span>[2414](#fn_2413) by which are
indicated the many different merits of those who dwell in them; so that
in these abodes the unbaptized is brought to forgiveness, and the
baptized to the reward which by grace has been prepared for him.” You
observe how the man keeps paradise and the mansions of the Father’s
house distinct from the kingdom of heaven, so that even unbaptized
persons may have an abundant provision in places of eternal happiness.
Nor does he see, when he says all this, that he is so unwilling to
distinguish the future abode of a baptized infant from the kingdom of
heaven as to have no fear in keeping distinct therefrom the very house
of God the Father, or the several parts thereof. For the Lord Jesus did
not say: In all the created universe, or in any portion of that
universe, but, “In my Father’s house, are many mansions.” But in what
way shall an unbaptized person live in the house of God the Father, when
he cannot possibly have God for his Father, except he be born again? He
should not be so ungrateful to God, who has vouchsafed to deliver him
from the sect of the Donatists or Rogatists, as to aim at dividing the
house of God the Father, and to put one portion of it outside the
kingdom of heaven, where the unbaptized may be able to dwell. And on
what terms does he himself presume that he is to enter into the kingdom
of heaven, when from that kingdom he <span id="page_338">p. 338</span>
<span id="xvii.v.xiv-Page_338"></span>excludes the house of the King
Himself, in what part soever He pleases? From the case, however, of the
thief who, when crucified at the Lord’s side, put his hope in the Lord
who was crucified with him, and from the case of Dinocrates, the brother
of St. Perpetua, he argues that even to the unbaptized may be given the
remission of sins and an abode with the blessed; as if any one unbelief
in whom would be a sin, had shown him that the thief and Dinocrates had
not been baptized. Concerning these cases, however, I have more fully
explained my views in the book which I wrote to our brother
Renatus. <span id="fr_2414"></span>[2415](#fn_2414) This your loving
self will be able to ascertain if you will condescend to read the book;
for I am sure our brother will not find it in his heart to refuse you,
if you ask him the loan of it.
