<span id="xvii.iv.xxviii"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 28.—A Natural Figure of Speech
Must Not Be Literally Pressed.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>He goes on to remark: “But the
apostle, by saying, ‘And He Himself giveth life and spirit to all,’ and
then by adding the words, ‘And hath made the whole race of men of one
blood,’ <span id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381) has referred this
soul and spirit to the Creator in respect of their origin, and the body
to propagation.” Now, certainly any one who does not wish to deny at
random the propagation of souls, before ascertaining clearly whether the
opinion is correct or not, has ground for understanding, from the
apostle’s words, that he meant the expression, *of one blood*, to be
equivalent to *of one man*, by the figure of speech which understands
the whole from its part. Well, then, if it be allowable for this man to
take the whole from a part in the passage, “And man became a living
soul,” <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382) as if the spirit also
was understood to be implied, about which the Scripture there said
nothing, why is it not allowable to others to attribute an equally
comprehensive sense to the expression, *of one blood*, so that the soul
and spirit may be considered as included in it, on the ground that the
human being who is signified by the term “*blood*” consists not of body
alone, but also of soul and spirit? For just as the controversialist who
maintains the propagation of souls, ought not, on the one hand, to press
this man too hard, because the Scripture says concerning the first man,
“In whom all have sinned” <span id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383)
(for the expression is not, In whom the flesh of all has sinned, but
“all,” that is, “all men,” seeing that man is not flesh only);—as, I
repeat, he ought not to be too hard pressed himself, because it happens
to be written “all men,” in such a way that they might be understood
simply in respect of the flesh; so, on the other hand, he ought not to
bear too hard on those who hold the propagation of souls, on the ground
of the phrase, “The whole race of men of one blood,” as if this passage
proved that flesh alone was transmitted by propagation. For if it is
true, as they <span id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384) assert, that
soul does not descend from soul, but flesh only from flesh, then the
expression, “*of one blood*,” does not signify the entire human being,
on the principle of a part for the whole, but merely the flesh of one
person alone; while that other expression, “In whom all have sinned,”
must be so understood as to indicate merely the flesh of all men, which
has been handed on from the first man, the Scripture signifying a part
by the whole. If, on the other hand, it is true that the entire human
being is propagated of each man, himself also entire, consisting of
body, soul, and spirit, then the passage, “In whom all have sinned,”
must be taken in its proper literal sense; and the other phrase, “*of
one blood*,” is used metaphorically, the whole being signified by a
part, that is to say, the whole man who consists of soul and flesh; or
rather (as this person is fond of putting it) of soul, and spirit, and
flesh. For both modes of expression the Holy Scriptures are in the habit
of employing, putting both a part for the whole and the whole for a
part. A part, for instance, implies the whole, in the place where it is
said, “Unto Thee shall all flesh come;” <span
id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385) the whole man being understood by
the term *flesh*. And the whole sometimes implies a part, as when it is
said that Christ was buried, whereas it was only His flesh that was
buried. Now as regards the statement which is made in the apostle’s
testimony, to the effect that “He giveth life and spirit to all,” I
suppose that nobody, after the foregoing discussion, will be moved by
it. No doubt “He giveth;” the fact is not in dispute; our question is,
How does He give it? By fresh inbreathing in every instance, or by
propagation? For with perfect propriety is He said to give the substance
of the flesh to the <span id="page_328">p. 328</span> <span
id="xvii.iv.xxviii-Page_328"></span>human being, though at the same time
it is not denied that He gives it by means of propagation.
