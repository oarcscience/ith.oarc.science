<span id="xvii.iv.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21.—The Second Passage Quoted by
Victor.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv.xxi-p2"></span>On the same principle we treat the
passage in which God says: “For my Spirit shall go forth from me; and I
have created every breath.” <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368)
Here the former clause, “My Spirit shall go forth from me, must be taken
as referring to the Holy Ghost, of whom the Saviour similarly says, “He
proceedeth from the Father.” <span id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369)
But the other clause, “I have created every breath,” is undeniably
spoken of each individual soul. Well; but God also creates the entire
body of man; and, as nobody doubts, He makes the human body by the
process of propagation: it is therefore, of course, still open to
inquiry concerning the soul (since it is evidently God’s work), whether
He creates it as He does the body; by propagation, or by inbreathing, as
He made the first soul.
