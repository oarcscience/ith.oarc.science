<span id="x.iv-p2"></span>In which Augustin argues against such as say
that in the present life there are, have been, and will be, men who have
absolutely no sin at all. He lays down four propositions on this head:
and teaches, first, that a man might possibly live in the present life
without sin, by the grace of God and his own free will; he next shows
that nevertheless in fact there is no man who lives quite free from sin
in this life; thirdly, he sets forth the reason of this,—because there
is no man who exactly confines his wishes within the limits of the just
requirement of each case, which just requirement he either fails to
perceive, or is unwilling to carry out in practice; in the fourth place,
he proves that there is not, nor has been, nor ever will be, a human
being—except the one mediator, Christ—who is free from all sin.
