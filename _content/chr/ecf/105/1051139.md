id="xxi.iii.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 57 \[XXII.\]—How Predestination
Must Be Preached So as Not to Give Offence.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lix-p2"></span>And yet this doctrine must not be
preached to congregations in such a way as to seem to an unskilled
multitude, or a people of slower understanding, to be in some measure
confuted by that very preaching of it. Just as even the foreknowledge of
God, which certainly men cannot deny, seems to be refuted if it be said
to them, “Whether you run or sleep, you shall be that which He who
cannot be deceived has foreknown you to be.” And it is the part of a
deceitful or an unskilled physician so to compound even a useful
medicament, that it either does no good or does harm. But it must be
said, “So run that you may lay hold; <span
id="fr_3698"></span>[3699](#fn_3698) and thus by your very running you
may know yourselves to be foreknown as those who should run lawfully:”
and in whatever other manner the foreknowledge of God may be so
preached, that the slothfulness of man may be repulsed.
