id="xxi.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.—Effect of Prayer for
Perseverance.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xiii-p2"></span>But, lest perchance it be said that
perseverance even to the end is not indeed lost when it has once been
given,—that is, when a man has persevered unto the end,—but that it is
lost, in some sense, when a man by contumacy so acts that he is not able
to attain to it; just as we say that a man who has not persevered unto
the end has lost eternal life or the kingdom of God, not because he had
already received and actually had it, but because he would have received
and had it if he had persevered;—let us lay aside controversies of
words, and say that some things even which are not possessed, but are
hoped to be possessed, may be lost. Let any one who dares, tell me
whether God cannot give what He has commanded to be asked from Him.
Certainly he who affirms this, I say not is a fool, but he is mad. But
God commanded that His saints should say to Him in prayer, “Lead us not
into temptation.” Whoever, therefore, is heard when he asks this, is not
led into the temptation of contumacy, whereby he could or would be
worthy to lose perseverance in holiness.
