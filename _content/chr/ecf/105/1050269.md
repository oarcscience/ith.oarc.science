<span id="xii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 22 \[XX.\]—How Our Nature Could Be
Vitiated by Sin, Even Though It Be Not a Substance.</span>

<span id="xii.xxvi-p2"></span>Now, do you not perceive the tendency and
direction of this controversy? Even to render of none effect the
Scripture where it is said “Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall
save His people from their sins.” <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[1179](#fn_1178) For how is He to save where there
is no malady? For the sins, from which this gospel says Christ’s people
have to be saved, are not substances, and according to this writer are
incapable of corrupting. O brother, how good a thing it is to remember
that you are a Christian! To believe, might perhaps be enough; but
still, since you persist in discussion, there is no harm, nay there is
even benefit, if a firm faith precede it; let us not suppose, then, that
human nature cannot be corrupted by sin, but rather, believing, from the
inspired Scriptures, that it is corrupted by sin, let our inquiry be how
this could possibly have come about. Since, then, we have already learnt
that sin is not a substance, do we not consider, not to mention any
other example, that not to eat is also not a substance? Because such
abstinence is withdrawal from a substance, inasmuch as food is a
substance. To abstain, then, from food is not a substance; and yet the
substance of our body, if it does altogether abstain from food, so
languishes, is so impaired by broken health, is so exhausted of
strength, so weakened and broken with very weariness, that even if it be
in any way able to continue alive, it is hardly capable of being
restored to the use of that food, by abstaining from which it became so
corrupted and injured. In the same way sin is not a substance; but God
is a substance, yea the height of substance and only true sustenance of
the reasonable creature. The consequence of departing from Him by
disobedience, and of inability, through infirmity, to receive what one
ought really to rejoice in, you hear from the Psalmist, when he says:
“My heart is smitten and withered like grass, since I have forgotten to
eat my bread.” <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1180](#fn_1179)
