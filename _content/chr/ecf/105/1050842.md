<span id="xviii.iv-p2"></span>He undertakes to examine the second letter
of the Pelagians, filled, like the first, with calumnies against the
Catholics—a letter that was sent by them to Thessalonica in the name of
eighteen bishops; and, first of all, he shows, by the comparison of the
heretical writings with one another, that the Catholics are by no means
falling into the errors of the Manicheans in detesting the dogmas of the
Pelagians. He repels the calumny of prevarication incurred by the Roman
clergy in the latter condemnation of Pelagius and Cœlestius by Zosimus,
showing that the Pelagian dogmas were never approved at Rome, although
for some time, by the clemency of Zosimus, Cœlestius was mercifully
dealt with, with a view to leading him to the correction of his errors.
He shows that, under the name of grace, Catholics neither assert a
doctrine of fate, nor attribute respect of persons to God; although they
truly say that God’s grace is not given according to human merits, and
that the first desire of good is inspired by God; so that a man does not
at all make a beginning of a change from bad to good, unless the
unbought and gratuitous mercy of God effects that beginning in him.
