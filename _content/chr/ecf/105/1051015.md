<span id="xx.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xx.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31.—The First Man Had Received the
Grace Necessary for His Perseverance, But Its Exercise Was Left in His
Free Choice.</span>

<span id="xx.xxxiv-p2"></span>The first man had not that grace by which
he should never will to be evil; but assuredly he had that in which if
he willed to abide he would never be evil, and without which, moreover,
he could not by free will be good, but which, nevertheless, by free will
he could forsake. God, therefore, did not will even him to be without
His grace, which He left in his free will; because free will is
sufficient for evil, but is too little <span
id="fr_3352"></span>[3353](#fn_3352) for good, unless it is aided by
Omnipotent Good. And if that man had not forsaken that assistance of his
free will, he would always have been good; but he forsook it, and he was
forsaken. Because such was the nature of the aid, that he could forsake
it when he would, and that he could continue in it if he would; but not
such that it could be brought about that he would. This first is the
grace which was given to the first Adam; but more powerful than this is
that in the second Adam. For the first is that whereby it is affected
that a man may have righteousness if he will; the second, therefore, can
do more than this, since by it it is even effected that he will, and
will so much, and love with such ardour, that by the will of the Spirit
he overcomes the will of the flesh, that lusteth in opposition to
it. <span id="fr_3353"></span>[3354](#fn_3353) Nor was that, indeed, a
small grace by which was demonstrated even the power of free will,
because man was so assisted that without this assistance he could not
continue in good, but could forsake this assistance if he would. But
this latter grace is by so much the greater, that it is too little for a
man by its means to regain his lost freedom; it is too little, finally,
not to be able without it either to apprehend the good or to continue in
good if he will, unless he is also *made to will.*
