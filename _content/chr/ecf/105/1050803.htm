<p><a name="xviii.iii.iv-p2"></A>Let us now, therefore, reply to Julian&#146;s letter. &#8220;Those Manicheans say,&#8221; says he, &#8220;with whom now we do not communicate,&#8212;that is, the whole of them with whom we differ,&#8212;that by the sin of the first man, that is, of Adam, free will perished: and that no one has now the power of living well, but that all are constrained into sin by the necessity of their flesh.&#8221; He calls the catholics Manicheans, after the manner of that Jovinian who a few years ago, as a new heretic, destroyed the virginity of the blessed Mary, and placed the marriage of the faithful on the same level with her sacred virginity. And he did not object this to the catholics on any other ground than that he wished them to seem to be either accusers or condemners of marriage.</p>
