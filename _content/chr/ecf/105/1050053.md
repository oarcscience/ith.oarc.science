<span id="x.iii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—Unless Infants are Baptized,
They Remain in Darkness.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxxv-p2"></span>“I am come,” says Christ, “a light into
the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in
darkness.” <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320) Now what does this
passage show us, but that every person is in darkness who does not
believe on Him, and that it is by believing on Him that he escapes from
this permanent state of darkness? What do we understand by the
*darkness* but sin? And whatever else it may embrace in its meaning, at
any rate he who believes not in Christ will “abide in darkness,”—which,
of course, is a penal state, not, as the darkness of the night,
necessary for the refreshment of living beings. \[XXV.\] So that
infants, unless they pass into the number of believers through the
sacrament which was divinely instituted for this purpose, will
undoubtedly remain in this darkness.
