<span id="xviii.v.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 \[II.\]—The Misrepresentation of
the Pelagians Concerning the Use of the Old Law.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.ii-p2"></span>They declare “that we say that the law
of the Old Testament was given not for the end that it might justify the
obedient, but rather that it might become the cause of greater sin.”
Certainly, they do not understand what we say concerning the law;
because we say what the apostle says, whom they do not understand. For
who can say that they are not justified who are obedient to the law,
when, unless they were justified, they could not be obedient? But we
say, that by the law is effected that what God wills to be done is
heard, but that by grace is effected that the law is obeyed. “For not
the hearers of the law,” says the apostle, “are just before God, but the
doers of the law shall be justified.” <span
id="fr_2675"></span>[2676](#fn_2675) Therefore the law makes hearers of
righteousness, grace makes doers. “For what was impossible to the law,”
says the same apostle, “in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent
His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in
the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us
who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.” <span
id="fr_2676"></span>[2677](#fn_2676) This is what we say;—let them pray
that they may one day understand it, and not dispute so as never to
understand it. For it is impossible that the law should be fulfilled by
the flesh, that is, by carnal presumption, in which the proud, who are
ignorant of the righteousness of God,—that is, which is of God to man,
that he may be righteous,—and desirous of establishing their own
righteousness,—as if by their own will, unassisted from above, the law
could be fulfilled,—are not subjected to the righteousness of God. <span
id="fr_2677"></span>[2678](#fn_2677) Therefore the righteousness of the
law is fulfilled in them who walk not according to the flesh—that is,
according to man, ignorant of the righteousness of God and desirous of
establishing his own—but walk according to the Spirit. But who walks
according to the Spirit, except whosoever is led by the Spirit of God?
“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of
God.” <span id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678) Therefore “the letter
killeth, but the Spirit maketh alive.” <span
id="fr_2679"></span>[2680](#fn_2679) And the letter is not evil because
it killeth; but it convicts the wicked of transgression. “For the law is
holy, and the commandment holy and just and good. Was, then,” says he,
“that which is good made death unto me? By no means; but sin, that it
might appear sin, worked death in me by that which is good, that it
might become above measure a sinner or a sin by the commandment.” <span
id="fr_2680"></span>[2681](#fn_2680) This is what is the meaning of “the
letter killeth.” “For the sting of death is sin, but the <span
id="page_403">p. 403</span> <span
id="xviii.v.ii-Page_403"></span>strength of sin is the law;” <span
id="fr_2681"></span>[2682](#fn_2681) because by the prohibition it
increases the desires of sin, and thence slays a man unless grace by
coming to his assistance makes him alive. <span
id="fr_2682"></span>[2683](#fn_2682)
