<span id="xi.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31 \[XVIII.\]—The Old Law Ministers
Death; The New, Righteousness.</span>

<span id="xi.xxxiv-p2"></span>Now, since, as he says in another passage,
“the law was added because of transgression,” <span
id="fr_839"></span>[840](#fn_839) meaning the law which is written
externally to man, he therefore designates it both as “the ministration
of death,” <span id="fr_840"></span>[841](#fn_840) and “the ministration
of condemnation;” <span id="fr_841"></span>[842](#fn_841) but the other,
that is, the law of the New Testament, he calls “the ministration of the
Spirit” <span id="fr_842"></span>[843](#fn_842) and “the ministration of
righteousness,” <span id="fr_843"></span>[844](#fn_843) because through
the Spirit we work righteousness, and are delivered from the
condemnation due to transgression. The one, therefore, vanishes away,
the other abides; for the terrifying schoolmaster will be dispensed
with, when love has succeeded to fear. Now “where the Spirit of the Lord
is, there is liberty.” <span id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844) But that
this ministration is vouchsafed to us, not on account of our deserving,
but from His mercy, the apostle thus declares: “Seeing then that we have
this ministry, as we have received mercy, let us faint not; but let us
renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor
adulterating the word of God with deceit.” <span
id="fr_845"></span>[846](#fn_845) By this “craftiness” and
“deceitfulness” he would have us understand the hypocrisy with which the
arrogant would fain be supposed to be righteous. Whence in the psalm,
which the apostle cites in testimony of this grace of God, it is said,
“Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and in whose
mouth is no guile.” <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846) This is the
confession of lowly saints, who do not boast to be what they are not.
Then, in a passage which follows not long after, the apostle writes
thus: “For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake. For God, who commanded the
light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the
light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ.” <span id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847) This is the knowledge
of His glory, whereby we know that He is the light which illumines our
darkness. And I beg you to observe how he inculcates this very point:
“We have,” says he, “this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.” <span
id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848) When further on he commends in glowing
terms this same grace, in the Lord Jesus Christ, until he comes to that
vestment of the righteousness of faith, “clothed with which we cannot be
found naked,” and whilst longing for which “we groan, being burdened”
with mortality, “earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house
which is from Heaven,” “that mortality might be swallowed up of
life;” <span id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849) —observe what he says:
“Now He that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God, who also
hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit;” <span
id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850) and after a little he thus briefly
draws the conclusion of the matter: “That we might be made the
righteousness of God in Him.” <span id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851)
This is not the righteousness whereby God is Himself righteous, but that
whereby we are made righteous by Him.
