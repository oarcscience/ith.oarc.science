<span id="xix.iv.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 42 \[XXI\]—God Does Whatsoever He
Wills in the Hearts of Even Wicked Men.</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xlii-p2"></span>Who can help trembling at those
judgments of God by which He does in the hearts of even wicked men
whatsoever He wills, at the same time rendering to them according to
their deeds? Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, rejected the salutary counsel
of the old men, not to deal harshly with the people, and preferred
listening to the words of the young men of his own age, by returning a
rough answer to those to whom he should have spoken gently. Now whence
arose such conduct, except from his own will? Upon this, however, the
ten tribes of Israel revolted from him, and chose for themselves another
king, even Jeroboam, that the will of God in His anger might be
accomplished which He had predicted would come to pass. <span
id="fr_3196"></span>[3197](#fn_3196) For what says the Scripture? “The
king hearkened not unto the people; for the turning was from the Lord,
that He might perform His saying, which the Lord spake to Ahijah the
Shilonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.” <span
id="fr_3197"></span>[3198](#fn_3197) All this, indeed, was done by the
will of man, although the turning was from the Lord. Read the books of
the Chronicles, and you will find the following passage in the second
book: “Moreover, the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were neighbours to the
Ethiopians; and they came up to the land of Judah, and ravaged it, and
carried away all the substance which was found in the king’s
house.” <span id="fr_3198"></span>[3199](#fn_3198) Here it is shown that
God stirs up enemies to devastate the countries which He adjudges
deserving of such chastisement. Still, did these Philistines and
Arabians invade the land of Judah to waste it with no will of their own?
Or were their movements so directed by their own will that the Scripture
lies which tells us that “the Lord stirred up their spirit” to do all
this? Both statements to be sure are true, because they both came by
their own will, and yet the Lord stirred up their spirit; and this may
also with equal truth be stated the other way: The Lord both stirred up
their spirit, and yet they came of their own will. For the Almighty sets
in motion even in the innermost hearts of men the movement of their
will, so that He does through their agency whatsoever He wishes to
perform through them,—even He who knows not how to will anything in
unrighteousness. What, again, is the purport of that which the man of
God said to King Amaziah: “Let not the army of Israel go with thee; for
the Lord is not with Israel, even with all the children of Ephraim: for
if thou shalt think to obtain with these, the Lord shall put thee to
flight before thine enemies: for God hath power either to strengthen or
to put to flight”? <span id="fr_3199"></span>[3200](#fn_3199) Now, how
does the power of God help some in war by giving them confidence, and
put others to flight by injecting fear into them, except it be that He
who has made all things according to His own will, in heaven and on
earth, <span id="fr_3200"></span>[3201](#fn_3200) also works in the
hearts of men? We read also what Joash, king of Israel, said when he
sent a message to Amaziah, king of Judah, who wanted to fight with him.
After certain other words, he added, “Now tarry at home; why dost thou
challenge me to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and
Judah with thee?” <span id="fr_3201"></span>[3202](#fn_3201) Then the
Scripture has added this sequel: “But Amaziah would not hear; for it
came of God, that he might be delivered into their hands, because they
sought after the gods of Edom.” <span
id="fr_3202"></span>[3203](#fn_3202) Behold, now, how God, wishing to
punish the sin of idolatry, wrought this in this man’s heart, with whom
He was indeed justly angry, not to listen to sound advice, but to
despise it, and go to the battle, in which he with his army was routed.
God says by the prophet Ezekiel, “If the prophet be deceived when he
hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet: I will
stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my
people Israel.”  <span id="fr_3203"></span>[3204](#fn_3203) Then there
is the book of Esther, who was a woman of the people of Israel, and in
the land of their captivity became the wife of the foreign King
Ahasuerus. In this book it is written, that, being driven by necessity
to interpose in behalf of her people, whom the king had ordered to be
slain in every part of his dominions, she prayed to the Lord. So
strongly was she urged by the necessity of the case, that she even
ventured into the royal presence with<span id="page_463">p. 463</span>
<span id="xix.iv.xlii-Page_463"></span>out the king’s command, and
contrary to her own custom. Now observe what the Scripture says: “He
looked at her like a bull in the vehemence of his indignation; and the
queen was afraid, and her colour changed as she fainted; and she bowed
herself upon the head of her delicate maiden which went before her. But
God turned the king, and transformed his indignation into
gentleness.” <span id="fr_3204"></span>[3205](#fn_3204) The Scripture
says in the Proverbs of Solomon, “Even as the rush of water, so is the
heart of a king in God’s hand; He will turn it in whatever way He shall
choose.” <span id="fr_3205"></span>[3206](#fn_3205) Again, in the 104th
Psalm, in reference to the Egyptians, one reads what God did to them:
“And He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal subtilly with His
servants.” <span id="fr_3206"></span>[3207](#fn_3206) Observe, likewise,
what is written in the letters of the apostles. In the Epistle of Paul,
the Apostle, to the Romans occur these words: “Wherefore God gave them
up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts;” <span
id="fr_3207"></span>[3208](#fn_3207) and a little afterwards: “For this
cause God gave them up unto vile affections;” <span
id="fr_3208"></span>[3209](#fn_3208) again, in the next passage: “And
even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave
them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
convenient.” <span id="fr_3209"></span>[3210](#fn_3209) So also in his
second Epistle to the Thessalonians, the apostle says of sundry persons,
“Inasmuch as they received not the love of the truth, that they might be
saved; therefore also God shall send them strong delusion, that they
should believe a lie; that they all might be judged who believed not the
truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” <span
id="fr_3210"></span>[3211](#fn_3210)
