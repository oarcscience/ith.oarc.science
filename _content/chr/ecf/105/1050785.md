<span id="xvii.vii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 29 \[XIX.\]—Does the Soul Take
the Body’s Clothes Also Away with It?</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxix-p2"></span>If, indeed, the soul were body, and
the form <span id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span
id="xvii.vii.xxix-Page_367"></span>were also a corporeal figure in which
it sees itself in dreams, on the ground that it received its expression
from the body in which it is enclosed: not a human being, if he lost a
limb, would in dreams see himself bereft of the amputated member,
although actually deprived of it. On the contrary, he would always
appear to himself entire and unmutilated, from the circumstance that no
part has been cut away from the soul itself. But since persons sometimes
see themselves whole and sometimes mutilated in limb, when this happens
to be their actual plight, what else does this fact show than that the
soul, both in respect of other things seen by it in dreams and in
reference to the body, bears about, hither and thither, not their
reality, but only their resemblance? The soul’s joy, however, or
sadness, its pleasure or pain, are severally real emotions, whether
experienced in actual or in apparent bodies. Have you not yourself said
(and with perfect truth): “Aliments and vestments are not wanted by the
soul, but only by the body”? Why, then, did the rich man in hell crave
for the drop of water? <span id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498) Why
did holy Samuel appear after his death (as you have yourself noticed)
clothed in his usual garments? <span
id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499) Did the one wish to repair the
ruins of the soul, as of the flesh, by the aliment of water? Did the
other quit life with his clothes on him? Now in the former case there
was a real suffering, which tormented the soul; but not a real body,
such as required food. While the latter might have seemed to be clothed,
not as being a veritable body, but a soul only, having the semblance of
a body with a dress. For although the soul extends and contracts itself
to suit the members of the body, it does not similarly adapt itself to
the clothes, so as to fit its form to them.
