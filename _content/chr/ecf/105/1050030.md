id="x.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.—The Law Could Not Take Away
Sin.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xii-p2"></span>Observe also what follows. Having said,
“In which all have sinned,” he at once added, “For until the law, sin
was in the world.” <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246) This means
that sin could not be taken away even by the law, which entered that sin
might the more abound, <span id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247) whether
it be the law of nature, under which every man when arrived at years of
discretion only proceeds to add his own sins to original sin, or that
very law which Moses gave to the people. “For if there had been a law
given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been
by the law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the
promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that
believe. <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248) But sin is not imputed
where there is no law.” <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249) Now what
means the phrase “*is not imputed,*” but “*is ignored,*” or “*is not
reckoned as sin?*” Although the Lord God does not Himself regard it as
if it had never been, since it is written: “As many as have sinned
without law shall also perish without law.” <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250)
