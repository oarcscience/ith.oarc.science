<span id="xiv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Pelagius’ Answer Examined. On
Origen’s Error Concerning the Non-Eternity of the Punishment of the
Devil and the Damned.</span>

<span id="xiv.xiv-p2"></span>But what Pelagius added, “Who believes
differently is an Origenist,” was approved by the judges, because in
very deed the Church most justly abominates the opinion of Origen, that
even they whom the Lord says are to be punished with everlasting
punishment, and the devil himself and his angels, after a time, however
protracted, will be purged, and released from their penalties, and shall
then cleave to the saints who reign with God in the association of
blessedness. This additional sentence, therefore, the synod pronounced
to be “not opposed to the Church,”—not in accordance with Pelagius, but
rather in accordance with the Gospel, that such ungodly and sinful men
shall be consumed by eternal fires as the Gospel determines to be worthy
of such a punishment; and that he is a sharer in Origen’s abominable
opinion, who affirms that their punishment can possibly ever come to an
end, when the Lord has said it is to be eternal. Concerning those
sinners, however, of whom the apostle declares that “they shall be
saved, yet so as by fire, after their work has been burnt up,” <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630) inasmuch as no objectionable
opinion in reference to them was manifestly charged against Pelagius,
the synod determined nothing. Wherefore he who says that the ungodly and
sinner, whom the truth consigns to eternal punishment, can ever be
liberated therefrom, is not unfitly designated by Pelagius as an
“*Origenist*.” But, on the other hand, he who supposes that no sinner
whatever deserves mercy in the judgment of God, may be designated by
whatever name Pelagius is disposed to give to him, only it must at the
same time be quite understood that this error is not received as truth
by the Church. “For he shall have judgment without mercy that hath
showed no mercy.” <span id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631)
