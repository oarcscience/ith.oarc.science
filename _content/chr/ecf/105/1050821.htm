<p><a name="xviii.iii.xxii-p2"></A>And it had once appeared to me also that the apostle was in this argument of his describing a man under the law.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2581"></A><A HREF="#fn_2581"><FONT SIZE="1">2582</FONT></A>
 But afterwards I was constrained to give up the idea by those words where he says, &#8220;Now, then, it is no more I that do it.&#8221; For to this belongs what he says subsequently also: &#8220;There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.&#8221; And because I do not see how a man under the law should say, &#8220;I delight in the law of God after the inward man;&#8221; since this very delight in good, by which, moreover, he does not consent to evil, not from fear of penalty, but from love of righteousness (for this is meant by &#8220;delighting&#8221;), can only be attributed to grace.</p>
