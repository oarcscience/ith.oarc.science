id="xii.liii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49 \[XLII.\]—A Man Can Be Sinless, But
Only by the Help of Grace. In the Saints This Possibility Advances and
Keeps Pace with the Realization.</span>

<span id="xii.liii-p2"></span>“Well, be it so,” says he, “I agree; he
testifies to the fact that all were sinners. He says, indeed, what they
have been, not that they might not have been something else. Wherefore,”
he adds, “if all then could be proved to be sinners, it would not by any
means prejudice our own definite position, in insisting not so much on
what men are, as on what they are able to be.” He is right for once to
allow that no man living is justified in God’s sight. He contends,
however, that this is not the question, but that the point lies in the
possibility of a man’s not sinning,—on which subject it is unnecessary
for us to take ground against him; for, in truth, I do not much care
about expressing a definite opinion on the question, whether in the
present life there ever have been, or now are, or ever can be, any
persons who have had, or are having, or are to have, the love of God so
perfectly as to admit of no addition to it (for nothing short of this
amounts to a most true, full, and perfect righteousness). For I ought
not too sharply to contend as to when, or where, or in whom is done that
which I confess and maintain can be done by the will of man, aided by
the grace of God. Nor do I indeed contend about the actual possibility,
forasmuch as the possibility under dispute advances with the realization
in the saints, their human will being healed and helped; whilst “the
love of God,” as fully as our healed and cleansed nature can possibly
receive it, “is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is
given to us.” <span id="fr_1254"></span>[1255](#fn_1254) In a better
way, therefore, is God’s cause promoted (and it is to its promotion that
our author professes to apply his warm defence of nature) when He is
acknowledged as our Saviour no less than as our Creator, than when His
succour to us as Saviour is impaired and dwarfed to nothing by the
defence of the creature, as if it were sound and its resources entire.
