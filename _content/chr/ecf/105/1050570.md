<span id="xvi.v.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 \[IV.\]—The Natural Good of Marriage.
All Society Naturally Repudiates a Fraudulent Companion. What is True
Conjugal Purity? No True Virginity and Chastity Except in Devotion to
True Faith.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.v-p2"></span>The union, then, of male and female for the
purpose of procreation is the natural good of marriage. But he makes a
bad use of this good who uses it bestially, so that his intention is on
the gratification of lust, instead of the desire of offspring.
Nevertheless, in sundry animals unendowed with reason, as, for instance,
in most birds, there is both preserved a certain kind of confederation
of pairs, and a social combination of skill in nest-building; and their
mutual division of the periods for cherishing their eggs and their
alternation in the labor of feeding their young, give them the
appearance of so acting, when they mate, as to be intent rather on
securing the continuance of their kind than on gratifying lust. Of these
two, the one is the likeness of man in a brute; the other, the likeness
of the brute in man. With respect, however, to what I ascribed to the
nature of marriage, that the male and the female are united together as
associates for procreation, and consequently do not defraud each other
(forasmuch as every associated state has a natural abhorrence of a
fraudulent companion), although even men without faith possess this
palpable blessing of nature, yet, since they use it not in faith, they
only turn it to evil and sin. In like manner, therefore, the marriage of
believers converts to the use of righteousness that carnal concupiscence
by which “the flesh lusteth against the Spirit.” <span
id="fr_2068"></span>[2069](#fn_2068) For they entertain the firm purpose
of generating offspring to be regenerated—that the children who are born
of them as “children of the world” may be born again and become “sons of
God.” Wherefore all parents who do not beget children with this
intention, this will, this purpose, of transferring them from being
members of the first man into being members of Christ, but boast as
unbelieving parents over unbelieving children,—however circumspect they
be in their cohabitation, studiously limiting it to the begetting of
children,—really have no conjugal chastity in themselves. For inasmuch
as chastity is a virtue, hating unchastity as its contrary vice, and as
all the virtues (even those whose operation is by means of the body)
have their seat in the soul, how can the body be in any true sense said
to be chaste, when the soul itself is committing fornication against the
true God? Now such fornication the holy psalmist censures when he says:
“For, lo, they that are far from Thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed
all them that go a whoring from Thee.” <span
id="fr_2069"></span>[2070](#fn_2069) There is, then, no true chastity,
whether conjugal, or vidual, or virginal, except that which devotes
itself to true faith. For though consecrated virginity is rightly
preferred to marriage, yet what Christian in his sober mind would not
prefer catholic Christian women who have been even more than once
married, to not only vestals, but also to heretical virgins? So great is
the avail of faith, of which the apostle says, “Whatsoever is not of
faith is sin;”  <span id="fr_2070"></span>[2071](#fn_2070) and of which
it is written in the Epistle to the Hebrews, “Without faith it is
impossible to please God.” <span id="fr_2071"></span>[2072](#fn_2071)
