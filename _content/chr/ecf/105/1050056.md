<span id="x.iii.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38.—What “Lighteth” Means.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxxviii-p2"></span>But why, after saying, “which
lighteth every man,” should he add, “that cometh into the world,” <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325) —the clause which has suggested the
opinion that He enlightens the minds of newly-born babes while the birth
of their bodies from their mother’s womb is still a recent thing? The
words, no doubt, are so placed in the Greek, that they may be understood
to express that the light itself “cometh into the world.” <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326) If, nevertheless, the clause must be
taken as expressing the man who cometh into this world, I suppose that
it is either a simple phrase, like many others one finds in the
Scriptures, which may be removed without impairing the general sense; or
else, if it is to be regarded as a distinctive addition, it was perhaps
inserted in order to distinguish spiritual illumination from that bodily
one which enlightens the eyes of the flesh either by means of the
luminaries of the sky, or by the lights of ordinary fire. So that he
mentioned the inner man as coming into the world, because the outward
man is of a corporeal nature, just as this world itself; as if he said,
“Which lighteth every man that cometh into the body,” in accordance with
that which is written: “I obtained a good spirit, and I came in a body
undefiled.” <span id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327) Or again, the
passage, “Which lighteth every one that cometh into the world,”—if it
was added for the sake of expressing some distinction,—might perhaps
mean: Which lighteth every inner man, because the inner man, when he
becomes truly wise, is enlightened only by Him who is the true Light.
Or, once more, if the intention was to designate reason herself, which
causes the human soul to be called rational (and this reason, although
as yet quiet and as it were asleep, for all that lies hidden in <span
id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span
id="x.iii.xxxviii-Page_30"></span>infants, innate and, so to speak,
implanted), by the term *illumination*, as if it were the creation of an
inner eye, then it cannot be denied that it is made when the soul is
created; and there is no absurdity in supposing this to take place when
the human being comes into the world. But yet, although his eye is now
created, he himself must needs remain in darkness, if he does not
believe in Him who said: “I am come a Light into the world, that
whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.” <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328) And that this takes place in the case
of infants, through the sacrament of baptism, is not doubted by mother
Church, which uses for them the heart and mouth of a mother, that they
may be imbued with the sacred mysteries, seeing that they cannot as yet
with their own heart “believe unto righteousness,” nor with their own
mouth make “confession unto salvation.” <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329) There is not indeed a man among the
faithful, who would hesitate to call such infants *believers* merely
from the circumstance that such a designation is derived from the act of
believing; for although incapable of such an act themselves, yet others
are sponsors for them in the sacraments.
