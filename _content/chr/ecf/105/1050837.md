<span id="xviii.iii.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 38 \[XX.\]—The Power of God’s
Grace is Proved.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.xxxviii-p2"></span>That this is true we do not
surmise by human conjecture, but we discern by the most evident
authority of the divine Scriptures. It is read in the books of the
Chronicles: “Also in Judah, the hand of God was made to give them one
heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes in the word
of the Lord.” <span id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608) Also by Ezekiel
the prophet the Lord says, “I will give them another heart, and a new
spirit will I give them; and I will take away their stony heart out of
their flesh, and I will give them an heart of flesh, that they may walk
in my commandments and observe my judgments and do them.” <span
id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609) And what is that which Esther the
queen prays when she says, “Give me eloquent speech in my mouth, and
enlighten my words in the sight of the lion, and turn his heart to
hatred of him that fighteth against us”? <span
id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610) How does she say such things as
these in her prayer to God, if God does not work His will in men’s
hearts? But perchance the woman was foolish in praying thus. Let us see,
then, whether the desire of the petitioner was vainly sent on in
advance, and whether the result did not follow as of one who heard. Lo,
she goes in to the king. We need not say much. And because she did not
approach him in her own order, under the compulsion of her great
necessity, “he looked upon her,” as it is written, “like a bull in the
impulse of his indignation. And the queen feared, and her colour was
changed through faintness, and she bowed herself upon the head of her
maid, who went before her. And God changed him, and converted his
indignation into mildness.” <span id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611)
Now what need is there to relate what follows, where the divine
Scripture testifies that God fulfilled what she had asked for by working
in the heart of the king nothing other than the will by which he
commanded, and it was done as the queen had asked of him? And now God
had heard her that it should be done, who changed the heart of the king
by a most secret and efficacious power before he had heard the address
of the woman beseeching him, and moulded it from indignation to
mildness,—that is, from the will to hurt, to the will to
favour,—according to that word of the apostle, “God worketh in you to
will also.” Did the men of God who wrote these things—nay, did the
Spirit of God Himself, under whose guidance such things were written by
them—assail the free will of man? Away with the notion! But He has
commended both the most righteous judgment and the most merciful aid of
the Omnipotent in all cases. For it is enough for man to know that there
is no unrighteousness with God. But how He dispenses those benefits,
making some deservedly vessels of wrath, others graciously vessels of
mercy,—who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been His
counsellor? If, then, we attain to the honour of grace, let us not be
ungrateful by attributing to ourselves what we have received. “For what
have we which we have not received?” <span
