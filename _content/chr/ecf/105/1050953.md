<span id="xix.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xix.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 19 \[VIII.\]—How is Eternal Life
Both a Reward for Service and a Free Gift of Grace?</span>

<span id="xix.iv.xix-p2"></span>And hence there arises no small
question, which must be solved by the Lord’s gift. If eternal life is
rendered to good works, as the Scripture most openly declares: “Then He
shall reward every man according to his works:” <span
id="fr_3054"></span>[3055](#fn_3054) how can eternal life be a matter of
grace, seeing that grace is not rendered to works, but is given
gratuitously, as the apostle himself tells us: “To him that worketh is
the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt;” <span
id="fr_3055"></span>[3056](#fn_3055) and again: “There is a remnant
saved according to the election of grace;” with these words immediately
subjoined: “And if of grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise
grace is no more grace”? <span id="fr_3056"></span>[3057](#fn_3056) How,
then, is eternal life by grace, when it is received from works? Does the
apostle perchance not say that eternal life is a grace? Nay, he has so
called it, with a clearness which none can possibly gainsay. It requires
no acute intellect, but only an attentive reader, to discover this. For
after saying, “The wages of sin is death,” he at once added, “The grace
of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” <span
