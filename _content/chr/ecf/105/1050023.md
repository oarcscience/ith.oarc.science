<span id="x.iii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5 \[V.\] —The Words, *Mortale* (Capable
of Dying), *Mortuum* (Dead), and *Moriturus* (Destined to Die).</span>

<span id="x.iii.v-p2"></span>Now previous to the change into the
incorruptible state which is promised in the resurrection of the saints,
the body could be *mortal* (capable of dying), although not destined to
die (*moriturus*); just as our body in its present state can, so to
speak, be capable of sickness, although not destined to be sick. For
whose is the flesh which is <span id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span
id="x.iii.v-Page_17"></span>incapable of sickness, even if from some
accident it die before it ever is sick? In like manner was man’s body
then mortal; and this mortality was to have been superseded by an
eternal incorruption, if man had persevered in righteousness, that is to
say, obedience: but even what was mortal (*mortale*) was not made dead
(*mortuum*), except on account of sin. For the change which is to come
in at the resurrection is, in truth, not only not to have death
incidental to it, which has happened through sin, but neither is it to
have mortality, \[or the very possibility of death,\] which the natural
body had before it sinned. He does not say: “He that raised up Christ
Jesus from the dead shall quicken also your *dead* bodies” (although he
had previously said, “the body is dead” <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220) ); but his words are: “He shall
quicken also your *mortal* bodies;” <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221) so that they are not only no longer
dead, but no longer mortal \[or capable of dying\], since the natural is
raised spiritual, and this mortal body shall put on immortality, and
mortality shall be swallowed up in life. <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222)
