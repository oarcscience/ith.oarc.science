id="x.iv.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 21 \[XIV.\]—All Righteous Men
Sinners.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xxi-p2"></span>In like manner, all who are described in
the Scriptures as exhibiting in their present life good will and the
actions of righteousness, and all who have lived like them since,
although lacking the same testimony of Scripture; or all who are even
now so living, or shall hereafter so live: all these are great, they are
all righteous, and they are all really worthy of praise,—yet they are by
no means without sin: inasmuch as, on the authority of the same
Scriptures which make us believe in their virtues, we believe also that
in “God’s sight no man living is justified,” <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543) whence all ask that He will “not enter
into judgment with His servants:” <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544) and that not only to all the faithful
in general, but to each of them in particular, the Lord’s Prayer is
necessary, which He delivered to His disciples. <span
id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545)
