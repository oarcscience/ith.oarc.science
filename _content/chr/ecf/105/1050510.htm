<p class="c46"><a name="xv.iii.lv-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xv.iii.lv-p1.1"></A>Chapter 55 [L.]&#8212;Ambrose Witnesses that Perfect Purity is Impossible to Human Nature.</span></p>  
<p><a name="xv.iii.lv-p2"></A>He ought, moreover, carefully to note that, in the very same context from which he quoted that passage of Ambrose&#146;s, which seemed so satisfactory for his purpose, he also said this: &#8220;To be spotless from the beginning is an impossibility to human nature.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1922"></A><A HREF="#fn_1922"><FONT SIZE="1">1923</FONT></A>
 In this sentence the venerable Ambrose does undoubtedly predicate feebleness and infirmity of that natural &#8220;capacity,&#8221; which Pelagius refuses faithfully to regard as corrupted by sin, and therefore boastfully extols. Beyond question, this runs counter to this man&#146;s will and inclination, although it does not contravene the truthful confession of the apostle, wherein he says: &#8220;We too were once by nature the children of wrath, even as others.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1923"></A><A HREF="#fn_1923"><FONT SIZE="1">1924</FONT></A>
 For through the sin of the first man, which came from his free will, our nature became corrupted and ruined; and nothing but God&#146;s grace alone, through Him who is the Mediator between God and men, and our Almighty Physician, succours it. Now, since we have already prolonged this work too far in treating of the assistance of the divine grace towards our justification, by which God co-operates in all things for good with those who love Him,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1924"></A><A HREF="#fn_1924"><FONT SIZE="1">1925</FONT></A>
 and whom He first loved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1925"></A><A HREF="#fn_1925"><FONT SIZE="1">1926</FONT></A>
&#8212;giving to them that He might receive from them: we must commence another treatise, as the Lord shall enable us, on the subject of sin also, which by one man has entered into the world, along with death, and so has passed upon all men,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1926"></A><A HREF="#fn_1926"><FONT SIZE="1">1927</FONT></A>
 setting forth as much as shall seem needful and sufficient, in opposition to those persons who have broken out into violent and open error, contrary to the truth here stated.</p>
