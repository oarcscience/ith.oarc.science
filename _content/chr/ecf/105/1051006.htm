<p class="c46"><a name="xx.xxv-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xx.xxv-p1.1"></A>Chapter 22.&#8212;True Children of God are True Disciples of Christ.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xx.xxv-p2"></A>Finally, the Saviour Himself says, &#8220;If ye continue in my word, ye are indeed my disciples.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3318"></A><A HREF="#fn_3318"><FONT SIZE="1">3319</FONT></A>
 Is Judas, then, to be reckoned among them, since he did not continue in His word? Are they to be reckoned among them of whom the gospel speaks in such wise, where, when the Lord had commanded His flesh to be eaten and His blood to be drunk, the Evangelist says, &#8220;These things said He in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum. Many, therefore, of His disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it? But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring at it, said to them, Doth this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascending where He was before? It is the Spirit that quickeneth, but the flesh profiteth nothing. The words that I have spoken unto you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the believing ones, and who should betray Him; and He said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man cometh unto me except it were given of my Father. From this time many of His disciples went away back from Him, and no longer walked with Him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3319"></A><A HREF="#fn_3319"><FONT SIZE="1">3320</FONT></A>
 Are not these even in the words of the gospel called disciples? And yet they were not truly disciples, because they did not continue in His word, according to what He says: &#8220;If ye continue in my word, then are ye indeed my disciples.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3320"></A><A HREF="#fn_3320"><FONT SIZE="1">3321</FONT></A>
 Because, therefore, they possessed not perseverance, as not being truly disciples of Christ, so they were not truly children of God even when they appeared to be so, and were so called. We, then, call men elected, and Christ&#146;s disciples, and God&#146;s children, because they are to be so called whom, being regenerated, we see to live piously; but they are then truly what they are called if they shall abide in that on account of which they are so called. But if they have not perseverance,&#8212;that is, if they continue not in that which they have begun to be,&#8212;they are not truly called what they are called and are not; for they are not this in the sight of Him to whom it is known what they are going to be,&#8212;that is to say, from good men, bad men.</p>
