<span id="xviii.iii-p8"></span>Augustin replies to a letter sent by
Julian, as it was said, to Rome; and first of all vindicates the
catholic doctrine from his calumnies; then discovers and confutes the
heretical sense of the Pelagians hidden in that profession of faith
which the author of the letter opposed to the catholics.

<span id="xviii.iii-p2"></span> \[When Augustin’s friend Alypius brought
to Africa the extracts from Julian’s reply to Augustin’s first book *On
Marriage and Concupiscence*, which were sent by Count Valerius, and
which occasioned the writing of his second book on the same subject (see
above, pp. 259 and 281), he also brought two letters sent by Pope
Boniface; the one ascribed to Julian, and the other to eighteen bishops
including Julian, which attacked the catholic faith, and Augustin
personally. It was in answer to these that this treatise was
written.—W.\]
