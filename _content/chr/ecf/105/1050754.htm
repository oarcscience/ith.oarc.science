<p><a name="xvii.vi.xxii-p2"></A>What these particular errors are, I have, to the best of my ability, already explained. But I will run over them again with a brief recapitulation. One is, &#8220;That God did not make the soul out of nothing, but out of His own self.&#8221; A <i> second</i> is, that &#8220;just as God who gives is Himself ever existent, so is He ever giving souls through infinite time.&#8221; The <i>third</i> is, that &#8220;the soul lost some merit by the flesh, which it had had previous to the flesh.&#8221; The <i>fourth</i> is, that &#8220;the soul by means of the flesh recovers its ancient condition, and is born again through the very same flesh by which it had deserved to be polluted.&#8221; The <i>fifth</i> is, that &#8220;the soul deserved to be sinful, previous to any sin.&#8221; The <i> sixth</i> is, that &#8220;infants which are forestalled by death before they are baptized, may yet attain to forgiveness of their original sins.&#8221; The <i>seventh</i> is, that &#8220;they whom the Lord has predestinated to be baptized may be taken away from his predestination, or die before that has been accomplished in them which the Almighty has predestined.&#8221; The <i>eighth</i> is, that &#8220;it is of infants who are fore-stalled by death, before they are born again in Christ, that the Scripture says, &#145;Speedily was he taken away, lest wickedness should alter his understanding,&#146;&#8221; with the remainder of the passage to the same effect in the Book of Wisdom. The <i>ninth</i> is, that &#8220;there are outside the kingdom of God some of those mansions which the Lord said were in His Father&#146;s house.&#8221; The <i>tenth</i> is, that &#8220;the sacrifice of Christians ought to be offered in behalf of those who have departed out of the body without being baptized.&#8221; The <i>eleventh</i> is, that &#8220;some of those persons who have departed this life without the baptism of Christ do not in the meanwhile go into the kingdom, but into paradise; afterwards, however, in the resurrection of the dead, they attain even to the blessedness of the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;</p>
