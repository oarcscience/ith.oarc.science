<span id="xvii.v.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.v.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—Victor Quotes Scriptures for
Their Silence, and Neglects the Biblical Usage.</span>

<span id="xvii.v.xx-p2"></span>As for the passage which affirms that
“God hath made of one blood all nations of men,” <span
id="fr_2427"></span>[2428](#fn_2427) and that in which Adam says, “This
is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,” <span
id="fr_2428"></span>[2429](#fn_2428) inasmuch as it is not said in the
one, “*of one soul,*” and in the other, “*soul of my soul,*” he supposes
that it is denied that children’s souls come from their parents, or the
first woman’s from her husband just as if, forsooth, had the sentence
run in the way suggested, “*of one soul,*” instead of “of one blood,”
anything else than the whole human being could be understood, without
any denial of the propagation of the body. So likewise, if it had been
said, “*soul of my soul*,” the flesh would not be denied, of course,
which evidently had been taken out of the man. Constantly does Holy
Scripture indicate the whole by a part, and a part by the whole. For
certainly, if in the passage which this man has quoted as his proof it
had been said that the human race had been made, not “of one blood,” but
“of one man,” it could not have prejudiced the opinion of those who deny
the propagation of souls, although man is not soul alone, nor only
flesh, but both. For they would have their answer ready to this effect,
that the Scripture here might have meant to indicate a part by the
whole, that is to say, the flesh only by the entire human being. In like
manner, they who maintain the propagation of souls contend that in the
passage where it is said, “of one blood,” the human being is implied by
the term “blood,” on the principle of the whole being expressed by a
part. For just as the one party seems to be assisted by the expres<span
id="page_341">p. 341</span> <span id="xvii.v.xx-Page_341"></span>sion,
“of one blood,” instead of the phrase, “of one man,” so the other side
evidently gets countenance from the statement being so plainly written,
“By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death
passed upon all men, for in him all sinned,” <span
id="fr_2429"></span>[2430](#fn_2429) instead of its being said, “in whom
the flesh of all sinned.” Similarly, as one party seems to receive
assistance from the fact that Scripture says, “This is now bone of my
bones, and flesh of my flesh,” on the ground that a part covers the
whole; so, again, the other side derives some advantage from what is
written in the immediate sequel of the passage, “She shall be called
woman, because she was taken out of her husband.” For, according to
their contention, the latter clause should have run, “Because her flesh
was taken out of her husband,” if it was not true that the entire woman,
soul and all, but only her flesh, was taken out of man. The fact,
however, of the whole matter is simply this, that after hearing both
sides, anybody whose judgment is free from party prejudice sees at once
that loose quotation is unavailing in this controversy; for against one
party, which maintains the opinion of the propagation of souls, those
passages must not be adduced which mention only a part, inasmuch as the
Scripture might mean by the part to imply the whole in all such
passages; as, for instance, when we read, “The Word was made
flesh,” <span id="fr_2430"></span>[2431](#fn_2430) we of course
understand not the flesh only, but the entire human being; nor against
the other party, who deny this doctrine of the soul’s propagation, is it
of any avail to quote those passages which do not mention a part of the
human being, but the whole; because in these the Scripture might
possibly mean to imply a part by the whole; as we confess that Christ
was buried, whereas it was only His flesh that was laid in the
sepulchre. We therefore say, that on such grounds there is no ground on
the one hand for rashly constructing, nor on the other hand for, with
equal rashness, demolishing the theory of propagation; but we add this
advice, that other passages be duly looked out, such as admit of no
ambiguity. <span id="fr_2431"></span>[2432](#fn_2431)
