id="xv.iii.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 49 \[XLV.\]—Ambrose Teaches with
What Eye Christ Turned and Looked Upon Peter.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xlix-p2"></span>That repentance, indeed, itself, which
beyond all doubt is an action of the will, is wrought into action by the
mercy and help of the Lord, is asserted by the blessed Ambrose in the
following passage in the ninth book of the same work: <span
id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898) “Good, says he, “are the tears
which wash away sin. They upon whom the Lord at last turns and looks,
bewail. Peter denied Him first, and did not weep, because the Lord had
not turned and looked upon him. He denied Him a second time, and still
wept not, because the Lord had not even yet turned and looked upon him.
The third time also he denied Him, Jesus turned and looked, and then he
wept most bitterly.” Let these persons read the Gospel; let them
consider how that the Lord Jesus was at that moment within, having a
hearing before the chief of the priests; whilst the Apostle Peter was
outside, <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899) and down in the
hall, <span id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900) sitting at one time
with the servants at the fire, <span
id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901) at another time standing, <span
id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902) as the most accurate and consistent
narrative of the evangelists shows. It cannot therefore be said that it
was with His bodily eyes that the Lord turned and looked upon him by a
visible and apparent admonition. That, then, which is described in the
words, “The Lord turned and looked upon Peter,” <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903) was effected internally; it was
wrought in the mind, wrought in the will. In mercy the Lord silently and
secretly approached, touched the heart, recalled the memory of the past,
with His own internal grace visited Peter, stirred and brought out into
external tears the feelings of his inner man. Behold in what manner God
is present with His help to our wills and actions; behold how “He
worketh in us both to will and to do.”
