id="xi.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.—Christ the True Healer.</span>

<span id="xi.xiii-p2"></span>Accordingly, the apostle shows that the
same medicine was mystically set forth in the passion and resurrection
of Christ, when he says, “Know ye not, that so many of us as were
baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into His death? Therefore we
were buried with Him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was
raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also
should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in
the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His
resurrection: knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that
the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve
sin. For he that is dead is justified from sin. Now, if we be dead with
Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him: knowing that
Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more
dominion over Him. For in that He died, He died unto sin once; but in
that He liveth, He liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves
to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our
Lord.” <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734) Now it is plain enough
that here by the mystery of the Lord’s death and resurrection is figured
the death of our old sinful life, and the rising of the new; and that
here is <span id="page_87">p. 87</span> <span
id="xi.xiii-Page_87"></span>shown forth the abolition of iniquity and
the renewal of righteousness. Whence then arises this vast benefit to
man through the letter of the law, except it be through the faith of
Jesus Christ?
