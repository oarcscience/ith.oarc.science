<p><a name="xv.iv.iv-p2"></A>You, of course, see that C&#339;lestius here conceded baptism for infants only in such a manner as to be unwilling to confess that the sin of the first man, which is washed away in the laver of regeneration, passes over to them, although at the same time he did not venture to deny this; and on account of this doubt he refused to condemn those who maintain &#8220;That Adam&#146;s sin injured only himself, and not the human race;&#8221; and &#8220;that infants at their birth are in the same condition wherein Adam was before the transgression.&#8221;</p>
