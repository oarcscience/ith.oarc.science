<p class="c46"><a name="xii.xxviii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xii.xxviii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 24 [XXII.]&#8212;Sin and the Penalty of Sin the Same.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xii.xxviii-p2"></A>&#8220;The very matter,&#8221; says he, &#8220;of sin is its punishment, if the sinner is so much weakened that he commits more sins.&#8221; He does not consider how justly the light of truth forsakes the man who transgresses the law. When thus deserted he of course becomes blinded, and necessarily offends more; and by so falling is embarrassed and being embarrassed fails to rise, so as to hear the voice of the law, which admonishes him to beg for the Saviour&#146;s grace. Is no punishment due to them of whom the apostle says: &#8220;Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1183"></A><A HREF="#fn_1183"><FONT SIZE="1">1184</FONT></A>
 This darkening was, of course, already their punishment and penalty; and yet by this very penalty&#8212;that is, by their blindness of heart, which supervenes on the withdrawal of the light of wisdom&#8212;they fell into more grievous sins still. &#8220;For giving themselves out as wise, they became fools.&#8221; This is a grievous penalty, if one only understands it; and from such a penalty only see to what lengths they ran: &#8220;And they changed,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1184"></A><A HREF="#fn_1184"><FONT SIZE="1">1185</FONT></A>
 All this they did owing to that penalty of their sin, whereby &#8220;their foolish heart was darkened.&#8221; And yet, owing to these deeds of theirs, which, although coming in the way of punishment, were none the less sins (he goes on to say): &#8220;Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1185"></A><A HREF="#fn_1185"><FONT SIZE="1">1186</FONT></A>
 See how severely God condemned them, giving them over to uncleanness in the very desires of their heart. Observe also the sins they commit owing to such condemnation: &#8220;To dishonour,&#8221; says he, &#8220;their own bodies among themselves.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1186"></A><A HREF="#fn_1186"><FONT SIZE="1">1187</FONT></A>
 Here is the punishment of iniquity, which is itself iniquity; a fact which sets forth in a clearer light the words which follow: &#8220;Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.&#8221; &#8220;For this cause,&#8221; says he, &#8220;God gave them up unto vile affections.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1187"></A><A HREF="#fn_1187"><FONT SIZE="1">1188</FONT></A>
 See how often God inflicts punishment; and out of the self-same punishment sins, more numerous and more severe, arise. &#8220;For even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature; and likewise the men also, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1188"></A><A HREF="#fn_1188"><FONT SIZE="1">1189</FONT></A>
 Then, to show that these things were so sins themselves, that they were also the penalties of sins, he further says: &#8220;And receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1189"></A><A HREF="#fn_1189"><FONT SIZE="1">1190</FONT></A>
 Observe how often it happens that the very punishment which God inflicts begets other sins as its natural offspring. Attend still further: &#8220;And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,&#8221; says he, &#8220;God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters, odious to God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1190"></A><A HREF="#fn_1190"><FONT SIZE="1">1191</FONT></A>
 Here, now, let our opponent say: &#8220;Sin ought not so to have been punished, that the sinner, through his punishment, should commit even more sins.&#8221;</p>
