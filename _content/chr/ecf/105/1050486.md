id="xv.iii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 31 \[XXX.\]—Pelagius and Cœlestius
Nowhere Really Acknowledge Grace.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxxi-p2"></span>Let him amend all this, that if human
infirmity has erred in subjects so profound, he may not add to the error
diabolical deception and wilfulness, either by denying what he has
really believed, or by maintaining what he has rashly believed, after he
has once discovered, on recollecting the light of truth, that he ought
never to have so believed. As for that grace, indeed, by which we are
justified,—in other words, whereby “the love of God is shed abroad in
our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us,” <span
id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864) —I have nowhere, in those writings
of Pelagius and Cœlestius which I have had the opportunity of reading,
found them acknowledging it as it ought to be acknowledged. In no
passage at all have I observed them recognising “the children of the
promise,” concerning whom the apostle thus speaks: “They which are
children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the
children of the promise are counted for the seed.” <span
id="fr_1865"></span>[1866](#fn_1865) For that which God promises we do
not ourselves bring about by our own choice or natural power, but He
Himself effects it by grace.
