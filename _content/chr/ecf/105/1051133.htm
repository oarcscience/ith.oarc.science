<p><a name="xxi.iii.liii-p2"></A>Wherefore, if both the apostles and the teachers of the Church who succeeded them and imitated them did both these things,&#8212;that is, both truly preached the grace of God which is not given according to our merits, and inculcated by wholesome precepts a pious obedience,&#8212;what is it which these people of our time think themselves rightly bound by the invincible force of truth to say, &#8220;Even if what is said of the predestination of God&#146;s benefits be true, yet it <A NAME="page_547"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 547</FONT></A> <a name="xxi.iii.liii-Page_547"></A>must not be preached to the people&#8221;?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3687"></A><A HREF="#fn_3687"><FONT SIZE="1">3688</FONT></A>
 It must absolutely be preached, so that he who has ears to hear, may hear. And who has them if he has not received them from Him who says, &#8220;I will give them a heart to know me, and ears to hear?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3688"></A><A HREF="#fn_3688"><FONT SIZE="1">3689</FONT></A>
 Assuredly, he who has not received may reject; while, yet, he who receives may take and drink, may drink and live. For as piety must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, God may be rightly worshipped; modesty must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, no illicit act may be perpetrated by his fleshly nature; charity must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, God and his neighbours may be loved;&#8212;so also must be preached such a predestination of God&#146;s benefits that he who has ears to hear may glory, not in himself, but in the Lord.</p>
