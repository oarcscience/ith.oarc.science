id="xviii.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8 \[IV.\]—The Pelagians Demolish
Free Will.</span>

<span id="xviii.iii.viii-p2"></span>These proud and haughty people will
not have this; and yet they do not maintain free will by purifying it,
but demolish it by exaggerating it. For they are angry with us who say
these things, for no other reason than that they disdain to glory in the
Lord. Yet Pelagius feared the episcopal judgment of Palestine; and when
it was objected to him that he said that the grace of God is given
according to our merits, he denied that he said so, and condemned those
who said this with an anathema. <span
id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541) And yet nothing else is found to be
defended in the books which he afterwards wrote, thinking that he had
made a <span id="page_380">p. 380</span> <span
id="xviii.iii.viii-Page_380"></span>fraud upon the men who were his
judges, by lying or by hiding his meaning, I know not how, in ambiguous
words. <span id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542)
