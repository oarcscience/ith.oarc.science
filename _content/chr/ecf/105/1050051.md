<span id="x.iii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33.—Christ is the Saviour and
Redeemer Even of Infants.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxxiii-p2"></span>Let us therefore give in and yield our
assent to the authority of Holy Scripture, which knows not how either to
be deceived or to deceive; and as we do not believe that men as yet
unborn have done any good or evil for raising a difference in their
moral deserts, so let us by no means doubt that all men are under sin,
which came into the world by one man and has passed through unto all
men; and from which nothing frees us but the grace of God through our
Lord Jesus Christ. \[XXIII.\] His remedial advent is needed by those
that are sick, not by the whole: for He came not to call the righteous,
but sinners; and into His kingdom shall enter no one that is not born
again of water and the Spirit; nor shall any one attain salvation and
eternal life except in His kingdom,—since the man who believes not in
the Son, and eats not His flesh, shall not have life, but the wrath of
God remains upon him. Now from this sin, from this sickness, from this
wrath of God (of which by nature they are children who have original
sin, even if they have none of their own on account of their youth),
none delivers them, except the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of
the world; <span id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310) except the Physician,
who came not for the sake of the sound, but of the sick; except the
Saviour, concerning whom it was said to the human race: “Unto you there
is born this day a Saviour;” <span id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311)
except the Redeemer, by whose blood our debt is blotted out. For who
would dare to say that Christ is not the Saviour and Redeemer of
infants? But from what does He save them, if there is no malady of
original sin within them? From what does He redeem them, if through
their origin from the first man they are not sold under sin? Let there
be then no eternal salvation promised to infants out of our own opinion,
without Christ’s baptism; for none is promised in that Holy Scripture
which is to be preferred to all human authority and opinion.
