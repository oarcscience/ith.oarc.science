id="xv.iv.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 34 \[XXIX.\]—No Man Ever Saved Save
by Christ.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.xxxiv-p2"></span>Now, whoever maintains that human
nature at any period required not the second Adam for its physician,
because it was not corrupted in the first Adam, is convicted as an enemy
to the grace of God; not in a question where doubt or error might be
compatible with soundness of belief, but in that very rule of faith
which makes us Christians. How happens it, then, that the human nature,
which first existed, is praised by these men as being so far less
tainted with evil manners? How is it that they overlook the fact that
men were even then sunk in so many intolerable sins, that, with the
exception of one man of God and his wife, and three sons and their
wives, the whole world was in God’s just judgment destroyed by the
flood, even as the little land of Sodom was afterwards with fire? <span
id="fr_1997"></span>[1998](#fn_1997) From the moment, then, when “by one
man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed
upon all men, in whom all sinned,” <span
id="fr_1998"></span>[1999](#fn_1998) the entire mass of our nature was
ruined beyond doubt, and fell into the possession of its destroyer. And
from him no one—no, not one—has been delivered, or is being delivered,
or ever will be delivered, except by the grace of the Redeemer.
