<span id="xiii.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—(39.) The Eighth Passage. In
What Sense He is Said Not to Sin Who is Born of God. In What Way He Who
Sins Shall Not See Nor Know God.</span>

<span id="xiii.xliii-p2"></span>“They also quote,” says he, “this
passage, “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us.” <span id="fr_1553"></span>[1554](#fn_1553) And this
very clear testimony he has endeavoured to meet with apparently
contradictory texts, saying thus: “The same St. John in this very
epistle says, ‘This, however, brethren, I say, that ye sin not.
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in
him: and he cannot sin.’ <span id="fr_1554"></span>[1555](#fn_1554) Also
elsewhere: ‘Whosoever is born of God sinneth not; because his being born
of God preserveth him, and the evil one toucheth him not.’ <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[1556](#fn_1555) And again in another passage, when
speaking of the Saviour, he says: ‘Since He was manifested to take away
sins, whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not
seen Him, neither known Him.’ <span id="fr_1556"></span>[1557](#fn_1556)
And yet again: ‘Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet
appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we
shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that
hath this hope towards Him purifieth himself, even as He is
pure.’” <span id="fr_1557"></span>[1558](#fn_1557) And yet,
notwithstanding the truth of all these passages, that also is true which
he has adduced, without, however, offering any explanation of it: “If we
say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
us.” <span id="fr_1558"></span>[1559](#fn_1558) Now it follows from the
whole of this, that in so far as we are born of God we abide in Him who
appeared to take away sins, that is, in Christ, and sin not,—which is
simply that “the inward man is renewed day by day;” <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[1560](#fn_1559) but in so far as we are born of
that man “through whom sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and
so death passed upon all men,” <span
id="fr_1560"></span>[1561](#fn_1560) we are not without sin, because we
are not as yet free from his infirmity, until, by that renewal which
takes place from day to day (for <span id="page_174">p. 174</span> <span
id="xiii.xliii-Page_174"></span>it is in accordance with this that we
were born of God), that infirmity shall be wholly repaired, wherein we
were born from the first than, and in which we are not without sin.
While the remains of this infirmity abide in our inward man, however
much they may be daily lessened in those who are advancing, “we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us, if we say that we have no sin.”
Now, however true it is that “whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, nor
known Him,” <span id="fr_1561"></span>[1562](#fn_1561) since with that
vision and knowledge, which shall be realized in actual sight, no one
can in this life see and know Him; yet with that vision and knowledge
which come of faith, there may be many who commit sin,—even apostates
themselves,—who still have believed in Him some time or other; so that
of none of these could it be said, according to the vision and knowledge
which as yet come of faith, that he has neither seen Him nor known Him.
But I suppose it ought to be understood that it is the renewal which
awaits perfection that sees and knows Him; whereas the infirmity which
is destined to waste and ruin neither sees nor knows Him. And it is
owing to the remains of this infirmity, of whatever amount, which remain
firm in our inward man, that “we deceive ourselves, and have not the
truth in us, when we say that we have no sin.” Although, then, by the
grace of renovation “we are the sons of God,” yet by reason of the
remains of infirmity within us “it doth not appear what we shall be;
only we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we
shall see Him as He is.” Then there shall be no more sin, because no
infirmity shall any longer remain within us or without us. “And every
man that hath this hope towards Him purifieth himself, even as He is
pure,”—purifieth himself, not indeed by himself alone, but by believing
in Him, and calling on Him who sanctifieth His saints; which
sanctification, when perfected at last (for it is at present only
advancing and growing day by day), shall take away from us for ever all
the remains of our infirmity.
