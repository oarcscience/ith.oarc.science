<span id="xxi.iii.lviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.lviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 56.—God Gives Means as Well as
End.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.lviii-p2"></span>Wherefore if I am unwilling to appear
ungrateful to men who have loved me, because some advantage of my labour
has attained to them before they loved me, how much rather am I
unwilling to be ungrateful to God, whom we should not love unless He had
first loved us and made us to love Him! since love is of Him, <span
id="fr_3697"></span>[3698](#fn_3697) as they have said whom He made not
only His great lovers, but also His great preachers. And what is more
ungrateful than to deny the grace of God itself, by saying that it is
given to us according to our merits? And this the catholic faith
shuddered at in the Pelagians, and this it objected to Pelagius himself
as a capital crime; and this Pelagius himself condemned, not indeed from
love of God’s truth, but yet for fear of his own condemnation. But
whoever as a faithful catholic is horrified to say that the grace of God
is given according to our merits, let him not withdraw faith itself from
God’s grace, whereby he obtained mercy that he should be faithful; and
thus let him attribute also perseverance to the <span id="page_549">p.
549</span> <span id="xxi.iii.lviii-Page_549"></span>end to God’s grace,
whereby he obtains the mercy which he daily asks for, not to be led into
temptation. But between the beginning of faith and the perfection of
perseverance there are those means whereby we live righteously, which
they themselves are agreed in regarding as given by God to us at the
prayer of faith. And all these things—the beginning of faith, to wit,
and His other gifts even to the end—God foreknew that He would bestow on
His called. It is a matter therefore, of too excessive contentiousness
to contradict predestination, or to doubt concerning predestination.
