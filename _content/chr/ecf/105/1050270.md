<span id="xii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23 \[XXI.\]—Adam Delivered by the
Mercy of Christ.</span>

<span id="xii.xxvii-p2"></span>But observe how, by specious arguments,
he continues to oppose the truth of Holy Scripture. The Lord Jesus, who
is called Jesus because He saves His people from their sins, <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180) in accordance with this His
merciful character, says: “They that be whole need not a physician, but
they that are sick; I am come not to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.” <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181) Accordingly, His
apostle also says: “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners.” <span id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182) This man, however,
contrary to the “faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,”
declares that “this sickness ought not to have been contracted by sins,
lest the punishment of sin should amount to this, that more sins should
be committed.” Now even for infants the help of the Great Physician is
sought. This writer asks: “Why seek Him? They are whole for whom you
seek the Physician. Not even was the first man condemned to die for any
such reason, for he did not sin afterwards.” As if he had ever heard
anything of his subsequent perfection in righteousness, except so far as
the Church commends to our faith that even Adam was delivered by the
mercy of the Lord Christ. “As to his posterity also,” says he, “not only
are they not more infirm than he, but they actually fulfilled more
commandments than he ever did, since he neglected to fulfil one,”—this
posterity which he sees so born (as Adam certainly was not made), not
only incapable of commandment, which they do not at all understand, but
hardly capable of sucking the breast, when they are hungry! Yet even
these would He have to be saved in the bosom of Mother Church by His
grace who saves His people from their sins; but these men gainsay such
grace, and, as if they had a deeper insight into the creature than ever
He possesses who made the creature, they pronounce \[these infants\]
sound with an assertion which is anything but sound itself.
