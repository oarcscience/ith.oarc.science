<span id="xvi.v.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvi.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 16 \[XIV.\]—A Certain Degree of
Intemperance is to Be Tolerated in the Case of Married Persons; The Use
of Matrimony for the Mere Pleasure of Lust is Not Without Sin, But
Because of the Nuptial Relation the Sin is Venial.</span>

<span id="xvi.v.xvi-p2"></span>But in the married, as these things are
desirable and praiseworthy, so the others are to be tolerated, that no
lapse occur into damnable sins; that is, into fornications and
adulteries. To escape this evil, even such embraces of husband and wife
as have not procreation for their object, but serve an overbearing
concupiscence, are permitted, so far as to be within range of
forgiveness, though not prescribed by way of commandment: <span
id="fr_2112"></span>[2113](#fn_2112) and the married pair are enjoined
not to defraud one the other, lest Satan should tempt them by reason of
their incontinence. <span id="fr_2113"></span>[2114](#fn_2113) For thus
says the Scripture: “Let the husband render unto the wife her due: <span
id="fr_2114"></span>[2115](#fn_2114) and likewise also the wife unto the
husband. The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.
Defraud ye not one the other; except it be with consent for a time, that
ye may have leisure for prayer; <span
id="fr_2115"></span>[2116](#fn_2115) and then come together again, that
Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. But I speak this by
permission, <span id="fr_2116"></span>[2117](#fn_2116) and not of
commandment.” <span id="fr_2117"></span>[2118](#fn_2117) Now in a case
where permission <span id="fr_2118"></span>[2119](#fn_2118) must be
given, it cannot by any means be contended that there is not some amount
of sin. Since, however, the cohabitation for the purpose of procreating
children, which must be admitted to be the proper end of marriage, is
not sinful, what is it which the apostle allows to be permissible, <span
id="fr_2119"></span>[2120](#fn_2119) but that married persons, when they
have not the gift of continence, may require one from the other the due
of the flesh—and that not from a wish for procreation, but for the
pleasure of concupiscence? This gratification incurs not the imputation
of guilt on account of marriage, but receives permission <span
id="fr_2120"></span>[2121](#fn_2120) on account of marriage. This,
therefore, must be reckoned among the praises of matrimony; that, on its
own account, it makes pardonable that which does not essentially
appertain to itself. For the nuptial embrace, which subserves the
demands of concupiscence, is so effected as not to impede the
child-bearing, which is the end and aim of marriage.
