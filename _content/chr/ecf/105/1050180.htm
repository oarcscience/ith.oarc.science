<p class="c46"><a name="xi.vii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xi.vii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 4.&#8212;Theirs is a Much More Serious Error, Requiring a Very Vigorous Refutation, Who Deny God&#146;s Grace to Be Necessary.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xi.vii-p2"></A>They, however, must be resisted with the utmost ardor and vigor who suppose that without God&#146;s help, the mere power of the human will in itself, can either perfect righteousness, or advance steadily towards it; and when they begin to be hard pressed about their presumption in asserting that this result can be reached without the divine assistance, they check themselves, and do not venture to utter such an opinion, because they see how impious and insufferable it is. But they allege that such attainments are not made without God&#146;s help on this account, namely, because God both created man with the free choice of his will, and, by giving him commandments, teaches him, Himself, how man ought to live; and indeed assists him, in that He takes away his ignorance by instructing him in the knowledge of what he ought to avoid and to desire in his actions: and thus, by means of the free-will naturally implanted within him, he enters on the way which is pointed out to him, and by persevering in a just and pious course of life, deserves to attain to the blessedness of eternal life.</p>
