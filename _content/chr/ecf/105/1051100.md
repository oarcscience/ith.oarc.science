<span id="xxi.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—But Why Should One Be Punished
More Than Another?</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xx-p2"></span>“But if,” it is said, “it was necessary
that, although all were not condemned, He should still show what was due
to all, and so He should commend His grace more freely to the vessels of
mercy; why in the same case will He punish me more than another, or
deliver him more than me?” I say not this. If you ask wherefore; because
I confess that I can find no answer to make. And if you further ask why
is this, it is because in this matter, even as His anger is righteous
and as His mercy is great, so His judgments are unsearchable.
