<span id="xi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 7 \[V.\]—What is Proposed to Be Here
Treated.</span>

<span id="xi.x-p2"></span>We will, however, consider, if you please, the
whole of this passage of the apostle and thoroughly handle it, as the
Lord shall enable us. For I want, if possible, to prove that the
apostle’s words, “The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,” do
not refer to figurative phrases,—although even in this sense a suitable
signification might be obtained from them,—but rather plainly to the
law, which forbids whatever is evil. When I shall have proved this, it
will more manifestly appear that to lead a holy life is the gift of
God,—not only because God has given a free-will to man, without which
there is no living ill or well; nor only because He has given him a
commandment to teach him how he ought to live; but because through the
Holy Ghost He sheds love abroad in the hearts <span
id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727) of those whom he foreknew, in order to
predestinate them; whom He predestinated, that He might call them; whom
He called, that he might justify them; and whom he justified, that He
might glorify them. <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728) When this
point also shall be cleared, you will, I think, see how vain it is to
say that those things only are unexampled possibilities, which are the
works of God,—such as the passage of the camel through the needle’s eye,
which we have already referred to, and other similar cases, which to us
no doubt are impossible, but easy enough to God; and that man’s
righteousness is not to be counted in this class of things, on the
ground of its being properly man’s work, not God’s; although there is no
reason for supposing, without an example, that his perfection exists,
even if it is possible. That these assertions are vain will be clear
enough, after it has been also plainly shown that even man’s
righteousness must be attributed to the operation of God, although not
taking place without man’s will; and we therefore cannot deny that his
perfection is possible even in this life, because <span id="page_86">p.
86</span> <span id="xi.x-Page_86"></span>all things are possible with
God,  <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729) —both those which He
accomplishes of His own sole will, and those which He appoints to be
done with the cooperation with Himself of His creature’s will.
Accordingly, whatever of such things He does not effect is no doubt
without an example in the way of accomplished facts, although with God
it possesses both in His power the cause of its possibility, and in His
wisdom the reason of its unreality. And should this cause be hidden from
man, let him not forget that he is a man; nor charge God with folly
simply because he cannot fully comprehend His wisdom.
