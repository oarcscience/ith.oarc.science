<span id="xii.ii-p5"></span>————————————

<span id="xii.ii-p6"></span>“<span class="c16"><span
id="xii.ii-p6.1"></span>At</span> that time also there came into my
hands a certain book of Pelagius’, in which he defends, with all the
argumentative skill he could muster, the nature of man, in opposition to
the grace of God whereby the unrighteous is justified and we become
Christians. The treatise which contains my reply to him, and in which I
defend grace, not indeed as in opposition to nature, but as that which
liberates and controls nature, I have entitled *On Nature and Grace*. In
this work sundry short passages, which were quoted by Pelagius as the
words of the Roman bishop and martyr, Xystus, were vindicated by
myself <span id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120) as if they really were
the words of this Sixtus. For this I thought them at the time; but I
afterwards discovered, that Sextus the heathen philosopher, and not
Xystus the Christian bishop, was their author. This treatise of mine
begins with the words: ‘The book which you sent me.’”
