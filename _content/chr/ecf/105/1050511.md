id="xv.iv-p2.1"></span>On Original Sin.</span>

<span id="xv.iv-p3"></span>Wherein Augustin shows that Pelagius really
differs in no respect, on the question of original sin and the baptism
of infants, from his follower Cœlestius, who, refusing to acknowledge
original sin and even daring to deny the doctrine in public, was
condemned in trials before the bishops—first at Carthage, and afterwards
at Rome; for this question is not, as these heretics would have it, one
wherein persons might err without danger to the faith. Their heresy,
indeed, aimed at nothing else than the very foundations of Christian
belief. He afterwards refutes all such as maintained that the blessing
of matrimony is disparaged by the doctrine of original depravity, and an
injury done to God himself, the Creator of man who is born by means of
matrimony.
