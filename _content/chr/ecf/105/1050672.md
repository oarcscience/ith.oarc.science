id="xvii.iv-p8.1"></span>Addressed to Renatus, the Monk.</span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p9"></span>On receiving from Renatus the two books of
Vincentius Victor, who disapproved of Augustin’s opinion touching the
nature of the soul, and of his hesitation in respect of its origin,
Augustin points out how the young objector, in his self-conceit in
aiming to decide on so abstruse a subject, had fallen into insufferable
mistakes. He then proceeds to show that those passages of Scripture by
which Victor thought he could prove that human souls are not derived by
propagation, but are breathed by God afresh into each man at birth, are
ambiguous, and inadequate for the confirmation of this opinion of his.
