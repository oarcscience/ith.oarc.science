id="xviii.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.—The Two Contrary Errors.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.iv-p2"></span>Let the Pelagians, then, cease to
object to the catholics that which they are not, but let them rather
hasten to amend what they themselves are; and let them not wish to be
considered deserving of approval because they are opposed to the hateful
error of the Manicheans, but let them acknowledge themselves to be
deservedly hateful because they do not put away their own error. For two
errors may be opposed to one another, although both are to be reprobated
because both are alike opposed to the truth. For if the Pelagians are to
be loved because they hate the Manicheans, the Manicheans should also be
loved because they hate the Pelagians. But be it far from our catholic
mother to choose some to love on the ground that they hate others, when
by the warning and help of the Lord she ought to avoid both, and should
desire to heal both.
