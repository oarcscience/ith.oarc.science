id="x.iv.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 43 \[XXVII.\]—Why the Children of
the Baptized Should Be Baptized.</span>

<span id="x.iv.xliii-p2"></span>If any man, however, is still perplexed
by the question why the children of baptized persons are baptized, let
him briefly consider this: Inasmuch as the generation of sinful flesh
through the one man, Adam, draws into condemnation all who are born of
such generation, so the generation of the Spirit of grace through the
one man Jesus Christ, draws to the justification of eternal life all
who, because predestinated, partake of this regeneration. But the
sacrament of baptism is undoubtedly the sacrament of regenation:
Wherefore, as the man who has never lived cannot die, and he who has
never died cannot rise again, so he who has never been born cannot be
born again. From which the conclusion arises, that no one who has not
been born could possibly have been born again in his father. Born again,
however, a man must be, after he has been born; because, “Except a man
be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” <span
id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613) Even an infant, therefore, must be
imbued with the sacrament of regeneration, lest without it his would be
an unhappy exit out of this life; and this baptism is not administered
except for the remission of sins. And so much does Christ show us in
this very passage; for when asked, How could such things be? He reminded
His questioner of what Moses did when he lifted up the serpent.
Inasmuch, then, as infants are by the sacrament of baptism conformed to
the death of Christ, it must be admitted that they are also freed from
the serpent’s poisonous bite, unless we wilfully wander from the rule of
the Christian faith. This bite, however, they did not receive in their
own actual life, but in him on whom the wound was primarily inflicted.
