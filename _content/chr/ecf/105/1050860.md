<span id="xviii.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 18.—The Desire of Good is God’s
Gift.</span>

<span id="xviii.iv.xviii-p2"></span>For they have thought that it was to
be objected to us that we say “that God inspires into unwilling and
resisting man the desire,” not of any very great good, but “even of
imperfect good.” Possibly, then, they themselves are keeping open, in
some sense at least, a place for grace, as thinking that man may have
the desire of good without grace, but only of imperfect good; while of
perfect, he could not easily have the desire with grace, but except with
it they could not have it at all. Truly, even in this way, too, they are
saying that God’s grace is given according to our merits, which
Pelagius, in the ecclesiastical meeting in the East, condemned, in the
fear of being condemned. For if without God’s grace the desire of good
begins with ourselves, merit itself will have begun—to which, as if of
debt, comes the assistance of grace; and thus God’s grace will not be
bestowed freely, but will be given according to our merit. But that he
might furnish a reply to the future Pelagius, the Lord does not say,
“Without me it is with difficulty that you can do anything,” but He
says, “Without me ye can do nothing.” <span
id="fr_2654"></span>[2655](#fn_2654) And, that He might also furnish an
answer to these future heretics, in that very same evangelical saying He
does not say, “Without me you can *perfect* nothing,” but “*do*”
nothing. For if He had said “perfect,” they might say that God’s aid is
necessary not for beginning good, which is of ourselves, but for
perfecting it. But let them hear also the apostle. For when the Lord
says, “Without me ye can do nothing,” in this one word He comprehends
both the beginning and the ending. The apostle, indeed, as if he were an
expounder of the Lord’s saying, distinguished both very clearly when he
says, “Because <span id="page_400">p. 400</span> <span
id="xviii.iv.xviii-Page_400"></span>He who hath begun a good work in you
will perfect it even to the day of Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_2655"></span>[2656](#fn_2655) But in the Holy Scriptures, in the
writings of the same apostle, we find more about that of which we are
speaking. For we are now speaking of the desire of good, and if they
will have this to begin of ourselves and to be perfected by God, let
them see what they can answer to the apostle when he says, “Not that we
are sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is
of God.” <span id="fr_2656"></span>[2657](#fn_2656) “To think anything,”
he says,—he certainly means, “to think anything good;” but is it less to
think than to desire. Because we think all that we desire, but we do not
desire all that we think; because sometimes also we think what we do not
desire. Since, then, it is a smaller thing to think than to desire,—for
a man may think good which he does not yet desire, and by advancing may
afterwards desire what before without desire he thought of,—how are we
not sufficient as of ourselves to that which is less, that is, to the
thinking of something good, but our sufficiency is of God; while to that
which is greater,—that is, to the desire of some good thing—without the
divine help, we are sufficient of free will? For what the apostle says
here is not, “Not that we are sufficient as of ourselves to think that
which is perfect;” but he says, “to think anything,” to which “nothing”
is the contrary. And this is the meaning of what the Lord says, “Without
me ye can do nothing.”
