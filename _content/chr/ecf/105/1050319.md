<span id="xii.lxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xii.lxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 72 \[LXI.\]—Hilary. The Pure in Heart
Blessed. The Doing and Perfecting of Righteousness.</span>

<span id="xii.lxxvi-p2"></span>He quotes the following words from the
blessed Hilary: “It is only when we shall be perfect in spirit and
changed in our immortal state, which blessedness has been appointed only
for the pure in heart, <span id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307) that
we shall see that which is immortal in God.” <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308) Now I am really not aware what is
here said contrary to our own statement, or in what respect this passage
is of any use to our opponent, unless it be that it testifies to the
possibility of a man’s being “pure in heart.” But who denies such
possibility? Only it must be by the grace of God, through Jesus Christ
our Lord, and not merely by our freedom of will. He goes on to quote
also this passage: “This Job had so effectually read these Scriptures,
that he kept himself from every wicked work, because he worshipped God
purely with a mind unmixed with offences: now such worship of God is the
proper work of righteousness.” <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[1310](#fn_1309) It is what Job had done which the
writer here spoke of, not what he had brought to perfection in this
world,—much less what he had done or perfected without the grace of that
Saviour whom he had actually foretold. <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[1311](#fn_1310) For that man, indeed, abstains from
every wicked work, who does not allow the sin which he has within him to
have dominion over him; and who, whenever an unworthy thought stole over
him, suffered it not to come to a head in actual deed. It is, how<span
id="page_147">p. 147</span> <span id="xii.lxxvi-Page_147"></span>ever,
one thing not to have sin, and another to refuse obedience to its
desires. It is one thing to fulfil the command, “Thou shalt not
covet;” <span id="fr_1311"></span>[1312](#fn_1311) and another thing, by
an endeavour at any rate after abstinence, to do that which is also
written, “Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.” <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[1313](#fn_1312) And yet one is quite aware that he
can do nothing of all this without the Saviour’s grace. It is to work
righteousness, therefore, to fight in an internal struggle with the
internal evil of concupiscence in the true worship of God; whilst to
perfect it means to have no adversary at all. Now he who has to fight is
still in danger, and is sometimes shaken, even if he is not overthrown;
whereas he who has no enemy at all rejoices in perfect peace. He,
moreover, is in the highest truth said to be without sin in whom no sin
has an indwelling,—not he who, abstaining from evil deeds, uses such
language as “Now it is no longer I that do it, but the sin that dwelleth
in me.” <span id="fr_1313"></span>[1314](#fn_1313)
