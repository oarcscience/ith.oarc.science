<p><a name="xv.iv.ii-p2"></A>C&#339;lestius, indeed, maintained this erroneous doctrine with less restraint. To such an extent did he push his freedom as actually to refuse, when on trial before the bishops at Carthage,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1929"></A><A HREF="#fn_1929"><FONT SIZE="1">1930</FONT></A>
 to condemn those who say, &#8220;That Adam&#146;s sin injured only Adam himself, and not the human race; and that infants at their birth are in the same state that Adam was in before his transgression.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1930"></A><A HREF="#fn_1930"><FONT SIZE="1">1931</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xv.iv.ii-p4"></A> Pelagius, at Diospolis, condemned this position of C&#339;lestius. Hence the comparative restraint of Pelagius, and the greater freedom in holding the error which is here attributed to C&#339;lestius.</p>
