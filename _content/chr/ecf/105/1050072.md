<span id="x.iii.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 54.—By the Sacrifices of the Old
Testament, Men Were Convinced of Sins and Led to the Saviour.</span>

<span id="x.iii.liv-p2"></span>And yet it is perhaps better to advance a
few testimonies out of the Old Testament also, which ought to have a
supplementary, or rather a cumulative value. The Lord Himself, speaking
by the Psalmist, says: “As for my saints which are upon earth, He hath
caused all my purposes to be admired in them.” <span
id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391) Not *their merits*, but “*my
purposes.*” For what is theirs except that which is afterwards
mentioned,—“their weaknesses are multiplied,” <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392) —above the weakness that they had?
Moreover, the law also entered, that the offence might abound. But why
does the Psalmist immediately add: “They hastened after?” <span
id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393) When their sorrows and infirmities
multiplied (that is, when their offence abounded), they then sought the
Physician more eagerly, in order that, where sin abounded, grace might
much more abound. He then says: “I will not gather their assemblies
together \[with their offerings\] of blood;” for by their many
sacrifices of blood, when they gathered their assemblies into the
tabernacle at first, and then into the temple, they were rather
convicted as sinners than cleansed. I shall no longer, He says, gather
their assemblies of blood-offerings together; because there is one
blood-shedding given for many, whereby they may be truly cleansed. Then
it follows: “Neither will I make mention of their names with my lips,”
as if they were the names of renewed ones. For these were their names at
first: children of the flesh, children of the world, children of wrath,
children of the devil, unclean, sinners, impious; but afterwards,
children of God,—a new name to the new man, a new song to the singer of
what is new, by means of the New Testament. Men must not be ungracious
with God’s grace, mean with great things; \[but be ever rising\] from
the less to the greater. The cry of the whole Church is, “I have gone
astray like a lost sheep.” <span id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394) From
all the members of Christ the voice is heard: “All we, as sheep, have
gone astray; and He hath Himself been delivered up for our sins.” <span
id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395) The whole of this passage of prophecy
is that famous one in Isaiah which was expounded by Philip to the eunuch
of Queen Candace, and he believed in Jesus. <span
id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396) See how often he commends this very
subject, and, as it were, inculcates it again and again on proud and
contentious men: “He was a man under misfortune, and one who well knows
to bear infirmities; wherefore also He turned away His face, He was
dishonoured, and was not much esteemed. He it is that bears our
weaknesses, and for us is involved in pains: and we accounted Him to be
in pains, and in misfortune, and in punishment. But it was He who was
wounded for our sins, was weakened for our iniquities; the chastisement
of our peace was upon Him; and by His bruise we are healed. All we, as
sheep, have gone astray; and the Lord delivered Him up for our sins. And
although He was evilly entreated, yet He opened not His mouth: as a
sheep was He led to the slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb before the
shearer, so He opened not His mouth. In <span id="page_36">p. 36</span>
<span id="x.iii.liv-Page_36"></span>His humiliation His judgment was
taken away: His generation who shall declare? For His life shall be
taken away from the earth, and for the iniquities of my people was He
led to death. Therefore I will give the wicked for His burial, and the
rich for His death; because He did no iniquity, nor deceit with His
mouth. The Lord is pleased to purge Him from misfortune. If you could
yourselves have given your soul on account of your sins, ye should see a
seed of a long life. And the Lord is pleased to rescue His soul from
pains, to show Him light, and to form it through His understanding; to
justify the Just One, who serves many well; and He shall Himself bear
their sins. Therefore He shall inherit many, and He shall divide the
spoils of the mighty; and He was numbered amongst the transgressors; and
Himself bare the sins of many, and He was delivered for their
iniquities.” <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397) Consider also that
passage of this same prophet which Christ actually declared to be
fulfilled in Himself, when He recited it in the synagogue, in
discharging the function of the reader: <span
id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398) “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because He hath anointed me: to preach glad tidings to the poor hath He
sent me, that so I may refresh all who are broken-hearted,—to preach
deliverance to the captives, and to the blind sight.” <span
id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399) Let us then all acknowledge Him; nor
should there be one exception among persons like ourselves, who wish to
cleave to His body, to enter through Him into the sheepfold, and to
attain to that life and eternal salvation which He has promised to His
own.—Let us, I repeat, all of us acknowledge Him who did no sin, who
bare our sins in His own body on the tree, that we might live with
righteousness separate from sins; by whose scars we are healed, when we
were weak  <span id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400) —like wandering
sheep.
