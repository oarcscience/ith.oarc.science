<span id="xxi.iii.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter 39 \[XVI\]—Prayer and
Exhortation.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xli-p2"></span>There are some, moreover, who either do
not pray at all, or pray coldly, because, from the Lord’s words, they
have learnt that God knows what is necessary for us before we ask it of
Him. Must the truth of this declaration be given up, or shall we think
that it should be erased from the gospel because of such people? Nay,
since it is manifest that God has prepared some things to be given even
to those who do not pray for them, such as the beginning of faith, and
other things not to be given except to those who pray for them, such as
perseverance even unto the end, certainly he who thinks that he has this
latter from himself does not pray to have it. Therefore we must take
care lest, while we are afraid of exhortation growing lukewarm, prayer
should be stifled and arrogance stimulated.
