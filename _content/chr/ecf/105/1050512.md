<span id="xv.iv.i-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.i-p1.1"></span>Chapter 1 \[I.\]—Caution Needed in Attending to
Pelagius’ Deliverances on Infant Baptism.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="xv.iv.i-p2.1"></span>Next</span> I beg of you, <span
id="fr_1927"></span>[1928](#fn_1927) carefully to observe with what
caution you ought to lend an ear, on the question of the baptism of
infants, to men of this character, who dare not openly deny the laver of
regeneration and the forgiveness of sins to this early age, for fear
that Christian ears would not bear to listen to them; and who yet
persist in holding and urging their opinion, that the carnal generation
is not held guilty of man’s first sin, although they seem to allow
infants to be baptized for the remission of sins. You have, indeed,
yourselves informed me in your letter, that you heard Pelagius say in
your presence, reading out of that book of his which he declared that he
had also sent to Rome, that they maintain that “infants ought to be
baptized with the same formula of sacramental words as adults.” <span
id="fr_1928"></span>[1929](#fn_1928) Who, after that statement, would
suppose that one ought to raise any question at all on this subject? Or
if he did, to whom would he not seem to indulge a very calumnious
disposition—previous to the perusal of their plain assertions, in which
they deny that infants inherit original sin, and contend that all
persons are born free from all corruption?
