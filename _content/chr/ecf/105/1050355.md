<span id="xiii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xiii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>(19.) The Commandment of Love Shall Be
Perfectly Fulfilled in the Life to Come.</span>

<span id="xiii.xxiii-p2"></span>And in this prayer, unless we choose to
be contentious, there is placed before our view a mirror of sufficient
brightness in which to behold the life of the righteous, who live by
faith, and finish their course, although they are not without sin.
Therefore they say, “Forgive us,” because they have not yet arrived at
the end of their course. Hence the apostle says, “Not as if I had
already attained, either were already perfect. . .Brethren, I count not
myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those
things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are
before, I press toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of
God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus
minded.” <span id="fr_1419"></span>[1420](#fn_1419) In other words, let
us, as many as are running perfectly, be thus resolved, that, being not
yet perfected, we pursue our course to perfection along the way by which
we have thus far run perfectly, in order that “when that which is
perfect is come, then that which is in part may be done away;” <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420) that is, may cease to be but in
part any longer, but become whole and complete. For to faith and hope
shall succeed at once the very substance itself, no longer to be
believed in and hoped for, but to be seen and grasped. Love, however,
which is the greatest among the three, is not to be superseded, but
increased and fulfilled,—contemplating in full vision what it used to
see by faith, and acquiring in actual fruition what it once only
embraced in hope. Then in all this plenitude of charity will be
fulfilled the commandment, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421) For while there remains any remnant
of the lust of the flesh, to be kept in check by the rein of continence,
God is by no means loved with all one’s soul. For the flesh does not
lust without the soul; although it is the flesh which is said to lust,
because the soul lusts carnally. In that perfect state the just man
shall live absolutely without any sin, since there will be in his
members no law warring against the law of his mind, <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422) but wholly will he love God, with
all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his mind <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423) which is the first and chief
commandment. For why should not such perfection be enjoined on man,
although in this life nobody may attain to it? For we do not rightly run
if we do not know whither we are to run. But how could it be known,
unless it were pointed out in precepts? <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424) Let us therefore “so run that we
may obtain.” <span id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425) For all who run
rightly will obtain,—not as in the contest of the theatre, where all
indeed run, but only one wins the prize. <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426) Let us run, believing, hoping,
longing; let us run, subjugating the body, cheerfully and heartily doing
alms,—in giving kindnesses and forgiving injuries, praying that our
strength may be helped as we run; and let us so listen to the
commandments which urge us to perfection, as not to neglect running
towards the fulness of love.
