<span id="xvii.vii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 13 \[IX.\]—In What Sense the Holy
Ghost is Said to Make Intercession for Us.</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xiii-p2"></span>Do you perhaps also think me
ridiculous and like the irrational beasts, because I said, “We know not
what we should pray for as we ought”? Perhaps this is not quite so
intolerable. For since, in the dictates of a sound and righteous
judgment, we prefer our future to our past; and since our prayer must
have reference not to what we have been, but what we shall be, it is of
course much more injurious not to know what we should pray for, than to
be ignorant of the manner of our origin. But recollect whose words I
repeated, or read them again for yourself, and reflect whence they come;
and do not pelt me with your reproaches, lest the stone you throw should
alight on a head you would not wish. For it is the great teacher of the
Gentiles, the Apostle Paul himself, who said, “For we know not what we
should pray for as we ought.” <span id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468)
And he not only taught this lesson by word, but also illustrated it by
his example. For, contrary to his own advantage and the promotion of his
own salvation, he once in his ignorance prayed that “the thorn in the
flesh might depart from him,” which he said had been given to him “lest
he should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations
which were given him.” <span id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469) But
the Lord loved him, and so did not do what he had requested Him to do.
Nevertheless, when the apostle said, “We know not what we should pray
for as we ought,” he immediately added, “But the Spirit Himself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And He that
searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because He
maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God” <span
id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470) —that is to say, He makes the
saints offer intercessions. He, of course, is that Spirit “whom God hath
sent into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father;” <span
id="fr_2471"></span>[2472](#fn_2471) and “by whom we cry, Abba,
Father;” <span id="fr_2472"></span>[2473](#fn_2472) for both expressions
are used by the apostle—both that we have received *the Spirit who
cries, Abba, Father;* and also that it is through Him that *we cry,
Abba, Father.* His object is to explain by these varied statements in
what sense he used the word “*crying:*” he meant *causing to cry;* so
that it is we who cry at His instance and impulse. Let Him therefore
teach me this too, whenever He pleases, if He knows it to be expedient
for me, that I should know whence I derive my origin as regards my soul.
But let me be taught by that Spirit who searches the deep things of God;
not by a <span id="page_360">p. 360</span> <span
id="xvii.vii.xiii-Page_360"></span>man who knows nothing of the breath
which inflates a bag. However, be it far from me to compare you with
brutes because of this piece of ignorance; because it arose not from
incurable inability, but from sheer inadvertence.
