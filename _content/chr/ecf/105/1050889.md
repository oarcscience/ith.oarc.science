<span id="xviii.v.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xviii.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 23.—There is No True
Righteousness Without the Faith of the Grace of Christ.</span>

<span id="xviii.v.xxiii-p2"></span>Wherefore he who lives according to
the righteousness which is in the law, without the faith of the grace of
Christ, as the apostle declares that he lived blameless, must be
accounted to have no true righteousness; not because the law is not true
and holy, but because to wish to obey the letter which commands, without
the Spirit of God which quickens, as if of the strength of free will, is
not true righteousness. But the righteousness according to which the
<span id="page_414">p. 414</span> <span
id="xviii.v.xxiii-Page_414"></span>righteous man lives by faith, since
man has it from God by the Spirit of grace, is true righteousness. And
although this is not undeservedly said to be perfect in some righteous
men, according to the capacity of this life, yet it is but little to
that great righteousness which the equality of the angels receives. And
he who had not yet possessed this, on the one hand, in respect of that
which was already in him, said that he was perfect; and in respect of
that which was still wanting to him, said that he was imperfect. But
manifestly that lower degree of righteousness makes merit, that higher
kind becomes reward. Whence he who does not strive after the former does
not attain unto the latter. Wherefore, after the resurrection of man, to
deny that there will be a fulness of righteousness, and to think that
the righteousness in the body of that life will be such as it can be in
the body of this death, is singular folly. But it is most true that men
do not there begin to fulfil those commands of God which here they have
been unwilling to obey. For there will be the fulness of the most
perfect righteousness, yet not of men striving after what is commanded,
and making gradual endeavours after that fulness; but in the twinkling
of an eye, even as shall be that resurrection of the dead itself,
because that greatness of perfect righteousness will be given as a
reward to those who here have obeyed the commandments, and will not
itself be commanded to them as a thing to be accomplished. But I should
in such wise say they have done the commandments, that we might remember
that to these very commandments belongs the prayer in which the holy
children of promise daily say with truth, “Thy will be done,” <span
