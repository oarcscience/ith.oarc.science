id="x.iii.lxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 70 \[XXXIX.\]—How Far Sin is Done
Away in Infants by Baptism, Also in Adults, and What Advantage Results
Therefrom.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lxx-p2"></span>In infants it is certain that, by the
grace of God, through *His* baptism who came in the likeness of sinful
flesh, it is brought to pass that the sinful flesh is done away. This
result, however, is so effected, that the concupiscence which is
diffused over and innate in the living flesh itself is not removed all
at once, so as to exist in it no longer; but only that that might not be
injurious to a man at his death, which was inherent at his birth. For
should an infant live after baptism, and arrive at an age capable of
obedience to a law, he finds there somewhat to fight against, and, by
God’s help, to overcome, if he has not received His grace in vain, and
if he is not willing to be a reprobate. For not even to those who are of
riper years is it given in baptism (except, perhaps, by an unspeakable
miracle of the almighty Creator), that *the law of sin* which is in
their members, warring against the law of their mind, should be entirely
extinguished, and cease to exist; but that *whatever of evil has been
done, said, or thought* by a man whilst he was servant to a mind subject
to its concupiscence, should be abolished, and regarded as if it had
never occurred. The concupiscence itself, however, (notwithstanding the
loosening of the bond of guilt in which the devil, by it, used to keep
the soul, and the destruction of the barrier which separated man from
his Maker,) remains in the contest in which we chasten our body and
bring it into subjection, whether to be relaxed for lawful and necessary
uses, or to be restrained by continence. <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441) But inasmuch as the Spirit of God, who
knows so much better than we do all the past, and present, and future of
the human race, foresaw and foretold that the life of man would be such
that “no man living should be justified in God’s sight,” <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442) it happens that through ignorance or
infirmity we do not exert all the powers of our will against it, and so
yield to it in the commission of sundry unlawful things,—becoming worse
in proportion to the greatness and frequency of our surrender; and
better, in proportion to its unimportance and infrequency. The
investigation, however, of the point in which we are now
interested—whether there could possibly be (or whether in fact there is,
has been, or ever will be) a man without sin in this present life,
except Him who said, “The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing
in me” <span id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443) —requires a much fuller
discussion; and the arrangement of the present treatise is such as to
make us postpone the question to the commencement of another book.
