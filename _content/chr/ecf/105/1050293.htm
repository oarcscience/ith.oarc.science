<p class="c46"><a name="xii.l-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xii.l-p1.1"></A>Chapter 46 [XXXIX.]&#8212;Shall We Follow Scripture, or Add to Its Declarations?</span></p>   
<p><a name="xii.l-p2"></A>It is, to be sure, a grand sentence with which he concluded this passage, when he says: &#8220;What we read, therefore, let us believe; and what we do not read, let us deem it wicked to add; and let it suffice to have said this of all cases.&#8221; On the contrary, I for my part say that we ought not to believe even everything that we read, on the sanction of the apostle&#146;s advice: &#8220;Read all things; hold fast that which is good.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1240"></A><A HREF="#fn_1240"><FONT SIZE="1">1241</FONT></A>
 Nor is it wicked to add something which we have not read; for it is in our power to add something which we have <i><span><a name="xii.l-p3.2"></A>bona fide</span></i>experienced as witnesses, even if it so happens that we have not read about it. Perhaps he will say in reply: &#8220;When I said this, I was treating of the Holy Scriptures.&#8221; Oh how I wish that he were never willing to add, I will not say anything but what he reads in the Scriptures, but in opposition to what he reads in them; that he would only faithfully and obediently hear that which is written there: &#8220;By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men; in which all have sinned;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1241"></A><A HREF="#fn_1241"><FONT SIZE="1">1242</FONT></A>
 and that he would not weaken the grace of the great Physician,&#8212;all by his unwillingness to confess that human nature is corrupted! Oh how I wish that he would, as a Christian, read the sentence, &#8220;There is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1242"></A><A HREF="#fn_1242"><FONT SIZE="1">1243</FONT></A>
 and that he would not so uphold the possibility of human nature, as to believe that man can be saved by free will without that Name!</p>
