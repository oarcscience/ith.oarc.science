<span id="xv.iii.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 33 \[XXXI.\]—Pelagius Professes
Nothing on the Subject of Grace Which May Not Be Understood of the Law
and Teaching.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.xxxiii-p2"></span>“See,” he says, “how this epistle
will clear me before your Blessedness; for in it we clearly and simply
declare, that we possess a free will which is unimpaired for sinning and
for not sinning; <span id="fr_1867"></span>[1868](#fn_1867) and this
free will is in all good works *always* assisted by divine help.” Now
you perceive, by the understanding which the Lord has given you, that
these words of his are inadequate to solve the question. For it is still
open to us to inquire what the help is by which he would say that the
free will is assisted; lest perchance he should, as is usual with him,
maintain that law and teaching are meant. If, indeed, you were to ask
him why he used the word “*always,*” he might answer: Because it is
written, And in His law will he meditate day and night.” <span
id="fr_1868"></span>[1869](#fn_1868) Then, after interposing a statement
about the condition of man, and his natural capacity for sinning and not
sinning, he added the following words: “Now this power of free will we
declare to reside generally in all alike—in Christians, in Jews, and in
Gentiles. In all men free will exists equally by nature, but in
Christians alone is it assisted by grace.” We again ask: “By what
grace?” And again he might answer: “By the law and the Christian
teaching.”
