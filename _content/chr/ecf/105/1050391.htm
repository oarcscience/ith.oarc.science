<p class="c46"><a name="xiv.x-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xiv.x-p1.1"></A>Chapter 6.&#8212;Pelagius&#146; Answer Examined.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xiv.x-p2"></A>Indeed, in this very book which contains these statements, after laying down the position, &#8220;All men are governed by their own will, and every one is submitted to his own desire,&#8221; Pelagius goes on to adduce the testimony of Scripture, from which it is evident enough that no man ought to trust to himself for direction. For on this very subject the Wisdom of Solomon declares: &#8220;I myself also am a mortal man like unto all; and the offspring of him that was first made of the earth,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1613"></A><A HREF="#fn_1613"><FONT SIZE="1">1614</FONT></A>
&#8212;with other similar words to the conclusion of the paragraph, where we read: &#8220;For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out therefrom: wherefore I prayed and understanding was given to me; I called, and the Spirit of Wisdom came into me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1614"></A><A HREF="#fn_1614"><FONT SIZE="1">1615</FONT></A>
 Now is it not clearer than light itself, how that this man, on duly considering the wretchedness of human frailty, did not dare to commit himself to his own direction, but prayed, and understanding was given to him, concerning which the apostle says: &#8220;But we have the understanding of the Lord;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1615"></A><A HREF="#fn_1615"><FONT SIZE="1">1616</FONT></A>
 and called, and the Spirit of <A NAME="page_186"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 186</FONT></A> <a name="xiv.x-Page_186"></A>Wisdom entered into him? Now it is by this Spirit, and not by the strength of their own will, that they who are God&#146;s children are governed and led.</p>
