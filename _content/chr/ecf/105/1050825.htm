<p><a name="xviii.iii.xxvi-p2"></A>&#8220;They also say,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that baptism does not give complete remission of sins, nor take away crimes, but that it shaves them off, so that the roots of all sins are retained in the evil flesh.&#8221; Who but an unbeliever can affirm this against the Pelagians? I say, therefore, that baptism gives remission of all sins, and takes away guilt, and does not shave them off; and &#8220;that the roots of all sins are&#8221; not &#8220;retained in the evil flesh, as if of shaved hair on the head, whence the sins may grow to be cut down again.&#8221; For it was I that found out that similitude, too, for them to use for the purposes of their calumny, as if I thought and said this.</p>
