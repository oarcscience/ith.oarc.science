<span id="xi.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 20.—The Law Without Grace.</span>

<span id="xi.xxiii-p2"></span>Now why need I speak of what follows? For
why it was that by this their impiety those men—I mean those who could
have known the Creator through the creature—fell (since “God resisteth
the proud” <span id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790) ) and whither they
plunged, is better shown in the sequel of this epistle than we can here
mention. For in this letter of mine we have not undertaken to expound
this epistle, but only mainly on its authority, to demonstrate, so far
as we are able, that we are assisted by divine aid towards the
achievement of righteousness,—not merely because God has given us a law
fall of good and holy precepts, but because our very will without which
we cannot do any good thing, is assisted and elevated by the importation
of the Spirit of grace, without which help mere teaching is “the letter
that killeth,” <span id="fr_791"></span>[792](#fn_791) forasmuch as it
rather holds them guilty of transgression, than justifies the ungodly.
Now just as those who come to know the Creator through the creature
received no benefit towards salvation, from their knowledge,—because
“though they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, nor gave Him
thanks, although professing themselves to be wise;” <span
id="fr_792"></span>[793](#fn_792) —so also they who know from the law
how man ought to live, are not made righteous by their knowledge,
because, “going about to establish their own righteousness, they have
not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.” <span
id="fr_793"></span>[794](#fn_793)
