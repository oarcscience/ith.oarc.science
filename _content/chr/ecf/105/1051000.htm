<p class="c46"><a name="xx.xix-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="xx.xix-p1.1"></A>Chapter 16.&#8212;Whosoever Do Not Persevere are Not Distinguished from the Mass of Perdition by Predestination.</span></p>   
<p><a name="xx.xix-p2"></A>Such as these were they who were signified to Timothy, where, when it had been said that Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus had subverted the faith of some, it is presently added, &#8220;Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord has known them that are His.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3300"></A><A HREF="#fn_3300"><FONT SIZE="1">3301</FONT></A>
 The faith of these, which worketh by love, either actually does not fail at all, or, if there are any whose faith fails, it is restored before their life is ended, and the iniquity which had intervened is done away, and perseverance even to the end is allotted to them. But they who are not to persevere, and who shall so fall away from Christian faith and conduct that the end of this life shall find them in that case, beyond all doubt are not to be reckoned in the number of these, even in that season wherein they are living well and piously. For they are not made to differ from that mass of perdition by the foreknowledge and predestination of God, and therefore are not called according to God&#146;s purpose, and thus are not elected; but are called among those of whom it was said, &#8220;Many are called,&#8221; not among those of whom it was said, &#8220;But few are elected.&#8221; And yet who can deny that they are elect, since they believe and are baptized, and live according to God? Manifestly, they are called elect by those who are ignorant of what they shall be, but not by Him who knew that they would not have the perseverance which leads the elect forward into the blessed life, and knows that they so stand, as that He has foreknown that they will fall.</p>
