<p><a name="xiii.xiv-p2"></A>X. &#8220;Since God made man good,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and, besides making him good, further commanded him to do good, how impious it is for us to hold that man is evil, when he was neither made so, nor so commanded; and to deny him the ability of being good, although he was both made so, and commanded to act so!&#8221; Our answer here is: Since then it was not man himself, but God, who made man good; so also is it God, and not man himself, who remakes him to be good, while liberating him from the evil which he himself did upon his wishing, believing, and invoking such a deliverance. But all this is effected by the renewal day by day of the inward man,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1384"></A><A HREF="#fn_1384"><FONT SIZE="1">1385</FONT></A>
 by the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, with a view to the outward man&#146;s resurrection at the last day to an eternity not of punishment, but of life.</p>
