<span id="xv.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xv.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 \[VIII.\]—Pelagius Deceived the
Council in Palestine, But Was Unable to Deceive the Church at
Rome.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.ix-p2"></span>Wherefore Pelagius, too, if he will only
reflect candidly on his own position and writings, has no reason for
saying that he ought not to have been banned with such a sentence. For
although he deceived the council in Palestine, seemingly clearing
himself before it, he entirely failed in imposing on the church at Rome
(where, as you well know, he is by no means a stranger), although he
went so far as to make the attempt, if he might somehow succeed. But, as
I have just said, he entirely failed. For the most blessed Pope Zosimus
recollected what his predecessor, who had set him so worthy an example,
had thought of these very proceedings. Nor did he omit to observe what
opinion was entertained about this man by the trusty Romans, whose faith
deserved to be spoken of in the Lord, <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936) and whose consistent zeal in
defence of catholic truth against this heresy he saw prevailing amongst
them with warmth, and at the same time most perfect harmony. The man had
lived among them for a long while, and his opinions could not escape
their notice; moreover, they had so completely found out his disciple
Cœlestius, as to be able at once to adduce the most trustworthy and
irrefragable evidence <span id="page_239">p. 239</span> <span
id="xv.iv.ix-Page_239"></span>on this subject. Now what was the solemn
judgment which the holy Pope Innocent formed respecting the proceedings
in the Synod of Palestine, by which Pelagius boasts of having been
acquitted, you may indeed read in the letter which he addressed to me.
It is duly mentioned also in the answer which was forwarded by the
African Synod to the venerable Pope Zosimus and which, along with the
other instructions, we have despatched to your loving selves. <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937) But it seems to me, at the same
time, that I ought not to omit producing the particulars in the present
work.
