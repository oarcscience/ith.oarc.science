<span id="x.iii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter 30.—Why One is Baptized and Another
Not, Not Otherwise Inscrutable.</span>

<span id="x.iii.xxx-p2"></span>Now those very persons, who think it
unjust that infants which depart this life without the grace of Christ
should be deprived not only of the kingdom of God, into which they
themselves admit that none but such as are regenerated through baptism
can enter, but also of eternal life and salvation,—when they ask how it
can be just that one man should be freed from original sin and another
not, although the condition of both of them is the same, might answer
their own question, in accordance with their own opinion of how it can
be so frequently just and right that one should have baptism
administered to him whereby to enter into the kingdom of God, and
another not be so favoured, although the case of both is alike. For if
the question disturbs him, why, of the two persons, who are both equally
sinners by nature, the one is loosed from that bond, on whom baptism is
conferred, and the other is not released, on whom such grace is not
bestowed; why is he not similarly disturbed by the fact that of two
persons, innocent by nature, one receives baptism, whereby he is able to
enter into the kingdom of God, and the other does not receive it, so
that he is incapable of approaching the kingdom of God? Now in both
cases one recurs to the apostle’s outburst of wonder “O the depth of the
riches!” Again, let me be informed, why out of the body of baptized
infants themselves, one is taken away, so that his understanding
undergoes no change from a wicked life,  <span
id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300) and the other survives, destined to
become an impious man? Suppose both were carried off, would not both
enter the kingdom of heaven? And yet there is no unrighteousness with
God. <span id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301) How is it that no one is
moved, no one is driven to the expression of wonder amidst such depths,
by the circumstance that some children are vexed by the unclean spirit,
while others experience no such pollution, and others again, as
Jeremiah, are sanctified even in their mother’s womb; <span
id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302) whereas all men, if there is original
sin, are equally guilty; or else equally innocent if there is original
sin? Whence this great diversity, except in the fact that God’s
judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out?
