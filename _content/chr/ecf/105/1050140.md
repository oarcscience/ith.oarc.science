<span id="x.iv.li-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iv.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter 51.—Why the Devil is Said to Hold the
Power and Dominion of Death.</span>

<span id="x.iv.li-p2"></span>Hence the Lord Himself willed to die, “in
order that,” as it is written of Him, “through death He might destroy
him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them
who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to
bondage.” <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629) From this passage it
is shown with sufficient clearness that even the death of the body came
about by the instigation and work of the devil,—in a word, from the sin
which he persuaded man to commit; nor is there any other reason why he
should be said in strictness of truth to hold the power of death.
Accordingly, He who died without any sin, original or actual, said in
the passage I have already quoted: “Behold, the prince of this world,”
that is, the devil, who had the power of death, “cometh and findeth
nothing in me,”—meaning, he shall find no sin in me, because of which he
has caused men to die. As if the question were asked Him: Why then
should you die? He says, “That all may know that I am doing the will of
my Father, arise, let us go hence;” <span
id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630) that is, that I may die, though I have
no cause of death from sin under the author of sin, but only from
obedience and righteousness, having become obedient unto death. Proof is
likewise afforded us by this passage, that the fact of the faithful
overcoming the fear of death is a part of the struggle of faith itself;
for all struggle would indeed be at an end, if immortality were at once
to become the reward of them that believe.
