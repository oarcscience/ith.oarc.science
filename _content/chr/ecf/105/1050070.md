<span id="x.iii.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="x.iii.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 52.—From the Acts of the
Apostles.</span>

<span id="x.iii.lii-p2"></span>To the like effect, in the Acts of the
Apostles, the Apostle Peter designated the Lord Jesus as “the Author of
life,” upbraiding the Jews for having put Him to death in these words:
“But ye dishonoured and denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a
murderer to be granted unto you, and ye killed the Author of
life.” <span id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384) While in another passage
he says: “This is the stone which was set at nought by you builders,
which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in
any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men
whereby we must be saved.” <span id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385) And
again, else<span id="page_35">p. 35</span> <span
id="x.iii.lii-Page_35"></span>where: “The God of our fathers raised up
Jesus, whom ye slew, by hanging on a tree. Him hath God exalted with His
right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to
Israel, and forgiveness of sins.” <span
id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386) Once more: “To Him give all the
prophets witness, that, through His name, whosoever believeth in Him
shall receive remission of sins.” <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387) Whilst in the same Acts of the
Apostles Paul says: “Be it known therefore unto you, men and brethren,
that through this Man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and
by Him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which
ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.” <span
id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388)
