<span id="xvii.vii.xxxv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xvii.vii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 35.—Do Angels Appear to Men in
Real Bodies?</span>

<span id="xvii.vii.xxxv-p2"></span>It would, however, require too
lengthy a discourse to enter very carefully on a discussion <span
id="page_369">p. 369</span> <span
id="xvii.vii.xxxv-Page_369"></span>concerning this kind of corporeal
semblances; whether angels even, either good ones or evil ones, appear
in this manner, <span id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505) whenever they
appear in the likeness of human beings or of any bodies whatever; or
whether they possess real bodies, and show themselves in this veritable
state of corporeity; or, again, whether by persons when dreaming,
indeed, or in a trance they are perceived in these forms—not in bodies,
but in the likeness of bodies—while to persons when awake they present
real bodies which can be seen, and, if necessary, actually touched. Such
questions as these, however, I do not deem it at all requisite to
investigate and fully treat in this book. By this time enough has been
advanced respecting the soul’s incorporeity. If you would rather persist
in your opinion that it is corporeal, you must first of all define what
“*body*” means; lest, peradventure, it may turn out that we are agreed
about the thing itself, but labouring to no purpose about its name. The
absurd conclusions, however, to which you would be reduced if you
thought of such a body in the soul, as are those substances which are
called “bodies” by all learned men,—I mean such as occupy portions of
space, smaller ones for their smaller parts, and larger ones for their
larger,—by means of the different relations of length and breadth and
thickness, I venture to think you are by this time able intelligently to
observe.

but *not* as real bodies.
