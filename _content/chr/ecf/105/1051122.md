<span id="xxi.iii.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.iii.xlii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 40.—When the Truth Must Be Spoken,
When Kept Back.</span>

<span id="xxi.iii.xlii-p2"></span>Therefore let the truth be spoken,
especially when any question impels us to declare it; and let them
receive it who are able, lest, perchance, while we are silent on account
of those who cannot receive it, they be not only defrauded of the truth
but be taken captive by falsehood, who are able to receive the truth
whereby falsehood may be avoided. For it is easy, nay, and it is useful,
that some truth should be kept back because of those who are incapable
of apprehending it. For whence is that word of our Lord: “I have yet
many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now”? <span
id="fr_3658"></span>[3659](#fn_3658) And that of the apostle: “I could
not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal: as if unto
babes in Christ I have given you to drink milk, and not meat, for
hitherto ye were not able, neither yet indeed now are ye able”? <span
id="fr_3659"></span>[3660](#fn_3659) Although, in a certain manner of
speaking, it might happen that what is said should be both milk to
infants and meat for grown-up persons. As “in the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,” <span
id="fr_3660"></span>[3661](#fn_3660) what Christian can keep it back?
Who can receive it? Or what in sound doctrine can be found more
comprehensive? And yet this is not kept back either from infants or from
grown-up people, nor is it hidden from infants by those who are mature.
But the reason of keeping back the truth is one, the necessity of
speaking the truth is another. It would be a tedious business to inquire
into or to put down all the reasons for keeping back the truth; of
which, nevertheless, there is this one,—lest we should make those who do
not understand worse, while wishing to make those who do understand more
learned; although these latter do not become more learned when we
withhold any such thing on the one hand, but also do not become worse.
When, however, a truth is of such a nature that he who cannot receive it
is made worse by our speaking it, and he who can receive it is made
worse by our silence concerning it, what do we think is to be done? Must
we not speak the truth, that he who can receive it may receive it,
rather than keep silence, so that not only neither may receive it, but
that even he who is more intelligent should himself be made worse? For
if he should hear and receive it, by his means also <span
id="page_542">p. 542</span> <span id="xxi.iii.xlii-Page_542"></span>many
might learn. For in proportion as he is more capable of learning, he is
the more fitted for teaching others. The enemy of grace presses on and
urges in all ways to make us believe that grace is given according to
our deservings, and thus grace is no more grace; and are we unwilling to
say what we can say by the testimony of Scripture? Do we fear, forsooth,
to offend by our speaking him who is not able to receive the truth? and
are we not afraid lest by our silence he who can receive the truth may
be involved in falsehood?
