<span id="xxi.ii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="xxi.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9 \[V.\]—The Purpose of the Apostle
in These Words.</span>

<span id="xxi.ii.ix-p2"></span>The notion, however, which they
entertain, “that these words, ‘What hast thou that thou hast not
received?’ cannot be said of this faith, because it has remained in the
same nature, although corrupted, which at first was endowed with health
and perfection,” <span id="fr_3448"></span>[3449](#fn_3448) is perceived
to have no force for the purpose that they desire if it be considered
why the apostle said these words. For he was concerned that no one
should glory in man, because dissensions had sprung up among the
Corinthian Christians, so that every one was saying, “I, indeed, am of
Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, and another, I am of Cephas;” <span
id="fr_3449"></span>[3450](#fn_3449) and thence he went on to say: “God
hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and
God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the strong
things; and God hath chosen the ignoble things of the world, and
contemptible things, and those things which are not, to make of no
account things which are; that no flesh should glory before God.” <span
id="fr_3450"></span>[3451](#fn_3450) Here the intention of the apostle
is of a certainty sufficiently plain against the pride of man, that no
one should glory in man; and thus, no one should glory in himself.
Finally, when he had said “that no flesh should glory before God,” in
order to show in what man ought to glory, he immediately added, “But it
is of Him that ye are in Christ Jesus, who is made unto us wisdom from
God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that
according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the
Lord.” <span id="fr_3451"></span>[3452](#fn_3451) Thence that intention
of his progressed, till afterwards rebuking them he says, “For ye are
yet carnal; for whereas there are among you envying and contention, are
ye not carnal, and walk according to man? For while one saith I am of
Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not men? What, then, is
Apollos, and what Paul? Ministers by whom you believed; and to every one
as the Lord has given. I have planted, and Apollos watered; but God gave
the increase. Therefore, neither is he that planteth anything, nor he
that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.” <span
id="fr_3452"></span>[3453](#fn_3452) Do you not see that the sole
purpose of the apostle is that man may be humbled, and God alone
exalted? Since in all those things, indeed, which are planted and
watered, he says that not even are the planter and the waterer anything,
but God who giveth the increase: and the very fact, also, that one
plants and another waters he attributes not to themselves, but to God,
when he says, “To every one as the Lord hath given; I have planted,
Apollos watered.” Hence, therefore, persisting in the same intention he
comes to the point of saying, “Therefore let no man glory in man,” <span
id="fr_3453"></span>[3454](#fn_3453) for he had already said, “He that
glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.” After these and some other matters
which are associated <span id="page_503">p. 503</span> <span
id="xxi.ii.ix-Page_503"></span>therewith, that same intention of his is
carried on in the words: “And these things, brethren, I have in a figure
transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes, that ye might learn
in us that no one of you should be puffed up for one against another
above that which is written. For who maketh thee to differ? And what
hast thou which thou hast not received? Now, if thou hast received it,
why dost thou glory as if thou receivedst it not?” <span
id="fr_3454"></span>[3455](#fn_3454)
