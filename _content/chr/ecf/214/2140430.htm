<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xlvii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.xlvii-p2.1"></A>Those</span> women who choose the ascetic life and are settled in monasteries may by no means go forth of them.&#160; If, however, any inexorable necessity compels them, let them do so with the blessing and permission of her who is mother superior; and even then they must not go forth alone, but with some old women who are eminent in the monastery, and at the command of the lady superior.&#160; But it is not at all permitted that they should stop outside.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.xlvii-p3"></A>And men also who follow the monastic life let them on urgent necessity go forth with the blessing of him to whom the rule is entrusted.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.xlvii-p4"></A>Wherefore, those who transgress that which is now decreed by us, whether they be men or women, are to be subjected to suitable punishments.</p>
