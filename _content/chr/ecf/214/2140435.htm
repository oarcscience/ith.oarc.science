<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.lii-p2.1"></A>This</span> holy and ecumenical synod altogether forbids those who are called &#8220;players,&#8221; and their &#8220;spectacles,&#8221; as well as the exhibition of hunts, and the theatrical dances.&#160; If any one despises the present canon, and gives himself to any of the things which are forbidden, if he be a cleric he shall be deposed, but if a layman let him be cut off.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lii-p7"></A>Some one will enquire why canon xxiiij. decrees that those in holy orders and monks, who are constantly attending horse-races, and <A NAME="page_389"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 389</FONT></A> <a name="xiv.iii.lii-Page_389"></A>scenic plays, are to cease or be deposed:&#160; but the present canon says without discrimination, that those who give themselves over to such things if clergymen are to be deposed, and if laymen to be cut off.&#160; The solution is this.&#160; It is one thing and more easily to be endured, that a man should be present at a horse-race, or be convicted of going to see a play; and another thing, and one that cannot be pardoned, that he should give himself over to such things, and to exercise this continually as his business.&#160; Wherefore those who have once sinned deliberately, are admonished to cease.&#160; If they are not willing to obey, they are to be deposed.&#160; But those who are constantly engaged in this wickedness, if they are clerics, they must be deposed from their clerical place, if laymen they must be cut off.</p>
