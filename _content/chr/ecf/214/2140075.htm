<p class="c34"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p1"></A> <span class="c4"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p1.1"></A>Canon XIV.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p2.1"></A>It</span> is decreed that among the clergy, presbyters and deacons who abstain from flesh shall taste of it, and afterwards, if they shall so please, may abstain.&#160; But if they disdain it, and will not even eat herbs served with flesh, but disobey the canon, let them be removed from their order.</p>

<p class="c36"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p4"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p4.1"></A>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIV.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p5"></A><i>A priest who is an abstainer from flesh, let him merely taste it and so let him abstain.&#160; But if he will not taste even the vegetables cooked with the meat let him be deposed</i> (<span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p5.1"></A>&#960;&#949;&#960;&#8049;&#965;&#963;&#952;&#969;</span>).</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p6"></A>There is a serious dispute about the reading of the Greek text.&#160; I have followed Routh, who, relying on three <span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p6.1"></A>mss.</span> the <i>Collectio</i> of John of Antioch and the Latin versions, reads <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p6.2"></A>&#949;&#7984; &#948;&#8050; &#946;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#8059;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> instead of the <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p6.3"></A>&#949;&#7984; &#948;&#8050; &#946;&#959;&#8059;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> of the ordinary text, which as Bp. Beveridge had pointed out before has no meaning unless a <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p6.4"></A>&#956;&#8052;</span> be introduced.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p7"></A>Zonaras points out that the canon chiefly refers to the Love feasts.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p8"></A>I cannot agree with Hefele in his translation of the last clause.&#160; He makes the reference to &#8220;this present canon,&#8221; I think it is clearly to the 53 (52) of the so-called Canons of the Apostles, <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xiv-p8.1"></A>&#964;&#8183; &#954;&#945;&#957;&#8057;&#957;&#953;</span> &#8220;the well-known Canon.&#8221;</p>
