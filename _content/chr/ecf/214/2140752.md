id="xvii.xxxii-p3.1"></span>The Encyclical Letter of Gennadius,
Patriarch of Constantinople and of the Holy Synod Met with Him to All
the Holy Metropolitans and to the Pope of the City of Rome. <span
id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608) </span>

<span id="xvii.xxxii-p5"></span>To the most beloved of God,
fellow-minister, Gennadius and the most holy synod assembled in the
royal city which is New Rome, sendeth greeting.

<span id="xvii.xxxii-p6"></span>As our Lord without money and without
price ordained his Apostles, so should we ordain the clergy, for the
Lord has placed us in their grade and in their stead (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xvii.xxxii-p6.1"></span>ἐις τὸν ἐκείνων βαθηόν
τε καὶ τόπον</span>).  Nor should we use any ingenious sophisms to avoid
this plain duty, explicitly laid upon us, not only by the words of the
Gospel but also by a canon of the great Ecumenical Synod of Chalcedon.

<span id="xvii.xxxii-p2"></span> The Greeks speak of the canons of The
Thirteen Holy Fathers, counting in the number St. Cyprian’s canon, but
as this was really Synodal I have placed it in that category.

<span id="xvii.xxxii-p4"></span> In this I have not followed Johnson,
but translated from Beveridge, *Synod*., Tom. II., p. 181.
