<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Canon XXV.  (Greek xxviii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p2"></span>Concerning bishops and the lower
orders who wait upon the most holy mysteries.  It has seemed good that
these abstain from their wives.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p3.1"></span>Aurelius</span>, the bishop, said:  We
add, most dear brethren, moreover, since we have heard of the
incontinency of certain clerics, even of readers, towards their wives,
it seemed good that what had been enacted in divers councils should be
confirmed, to wit, that subdeacons who wait upon the holy mysteries, and
deacons, and presbyters, as well as bishops according to former
statutes, <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426) should contain from
their wives, so that they should be as though they had them not and
unless they so act, let them be removed from office.  But the rest of
the clergy are not to be compelled to this, unless they be of mature
age.  And by the whole council it was said:  What your holiness has said
is just, holy, and pleasing to God, and we confirm it.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXV.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p7"></span>Those who handle holy things should
abstain even from their own wives at the times of their ministration.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p8"></span>This is founded upon Canon iv. of the
Council of Carthage, which met September 13th, 401, but the provisions
are more stringent here, subdeacons as well as deacons being constrained
to continence.

id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p9.1"></span>Johnson.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p10"></span>“Times of ministration,” so it is
explained, Can. Trull., 13, where there were several African Bishops
present, and allowed of that explication; yet Dion. Exig. is not clear,
viz., *Secundum propria statuta*.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p11"></span>By *Can. Laod*., 23.  Ministers,
i.e., sub-deacons, are forbid to touch the Holy Vessels, yet here they
are said to handle the Mysteries; I suppose they might handle the Holy
Vessels, etc. before and after the celebration, but not during the
solemnity; or else the customs of several ages and countries differed as
to this particular.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p4"></span> The Greek reads “<span
class="Greek"><span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvi-p4.1"></span>κατὰ τοὺς ἰδίους
ὅρους</span>,” and so it was understood at the Council of Trullo, as is
evident from Canon XIII, of that synod.  The Latin is “secundum propria
statuta,” but Bruns reads “priora.”
