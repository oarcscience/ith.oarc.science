id="xiv.iii.lxviii-p1.1"></span>Canon LXVII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> divine Scripture commands us
to abstain from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. 
Those therefore who on account of a dainty stomach prepare by any art
for food the blood of any animal, and so eat it, we punish suitably.  If
anyone henceforth venture to eat in any way the blood of an animal, if
he be a clergyman, let him be deposed; if a layman, let him be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxviii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxviii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXVII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxviii-p5"></span>A cleric eating blood shall be
deposed, but a layman shall be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxviii-p7"></span>The apostolic precept of abstaining
“from blood and from things strangled” for some ages, not only among the
Greeks but also among the Latins, was observed in many churches, but
little by little and step by step it died out in the whole Church, at
least in the Latin Church, altogether.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxviii-p8"></span>In this the Latin Church followed
the opinion of St. Augustine, *Contra Faustum Manichæum*, Lib. XXXII.,
cap. xiij., where he teaches at great length that the precept was given
to Christians only while the Gentile Church was not yet settled.  This
passage of Augustine also proves that at that time Africa did not
observe this precept of the Apostles.
