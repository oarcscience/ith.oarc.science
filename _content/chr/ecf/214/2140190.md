<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Canon XXI.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>The</span> subdeacons have no right
to a place in the Diaconicum, nor to touch the Lord’s vessels.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXI.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p5"></span>A subdeacon shall not touch the
vessels.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p6"></span>The “Lord’s vessels” are the
chalice and what we call the sacred vessels.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p7.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p8"></span>The ecclesiastical ministers
shall not take into their hands the Lord’s vessels, but they shall be
carried to the Table by the priests or deacons.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p9"></span>Both Balsamon and Zonaras agree
that by <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p9.1"></span>ὑπέρεται</span> is here meant
subdeacons.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p10.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p11"></span>It is doubtful whether by
*diaconicum* is here meant the place where the deacons stood during
service, or the *diaconicum* generally so called, which answers to our
sacristy of the present day.  In this *diaconicum* the sacred vessels
and vestments were kept; and as the last part of the canon especially
mentions these, I have no doubt that the *diaconicum* must mean the
sacristy.  For the rest, this canon is only the concrete expression of
the rule, that the subdeacons shall not assume the functions of the
deacons.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p12"></span>With regard to the last words of
this canon, Morinus and Van Espen are of opinion that the subdeacons
were not altogether forbidden to touch the sacred vessels, for this had
never been the case, but that it was intended that at the solemn
entrance to the altar, peculiar to the Greek service, the sacred vessels
which were then carried should not be borne by the subdeacons.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxiv-p13"></span>This canon is found in the
*Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xxiii., c.
xxvj.
