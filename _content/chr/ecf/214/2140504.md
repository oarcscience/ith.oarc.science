<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Canon X.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p2"></span>(*Greeks*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.x-p3.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.x-p3.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  This also I think
necessary. <span id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392)   Ye should consider
with all thoroughness and care, that if some rich man or professional
advocate be desired for bishop, he be not ordained until he have
fulfilled the ministry of reader, deacon, and presbyter, in order that,
passing by promotion through the several grades, he may <span
id="page_425">p. 425</span> <span
id="xv.iii.iv.x-Page_425"></span>advance (if, that is, he be found
worthy) to the height of the episcopate.  And he shall remain in each
order assuredly for no brief time, that so his faith, his reputable
life, his steadfastness of character and considerateness of demeanour
may be well-known, and that he, being deemed worthy of the divine
sacerdotal office \[*sacerdotium*, i.e., the episcopate\] may enjoy the
highest honour.  For it is not fitting, nor does discipline or good
conversation allow to proceed to this act rashly or lightly, so as to
ordain a bishop or presbyter or deacon hastily; as thus he would rightly
be accounted a novice, especially since also the most blessed Apostle,
he who was the teacher of the Gentiles, is seen to have forbidden hasty
ordinations; for the test of \[even\] the longest period will not
unreasonably be required to exemplify the conversation and character of
each \[candidate\].

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p5"></span>All said that this was their pleasure
and that it must be absolutely irreversible.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p6"></span>(*Latin*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.x-p7.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.x-p7.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  This also I think it
necessary for you to consider most carefully, that if perchance some
rich man or professional advocate or ex-official be desired for bishop,
he be not ordained until he have fulfilled the ministry of a reader and
the office of deacon and presbyter, and so ascend, if he have shown
himself worthy, through the several grades to the height of the
episcopate.  For by these promotions which in any case take a
considerable length of time can be tested his faith, his discretion, his
gravity and modesty.  And if he be found worthy, let him be honoured
with the divine sacerdotal office \[i.e. the episcopate\].  For it is
not fitting, nor does order or discipline allow, that one be rashly or
lightly ordained bishop, presbyter or deacon, who is a novice,
especially since also the blessed Apostle, the teacher of the Gentiles,
is seen to have expressly forbidden it.  But those \[should be
ordained\] whose life has been tested and their merit approved by length
of time.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p8"></span>All said that this was their pleasure.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.x-p10.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon X.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p11"></span>*No lawyer, teacher, or gentleman*
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.x-p11.1"></span>πλούσιος</span>) *shall be made a bishop
without passing through the holy orders.  Nor shall the space of time
between the orders be made too brief, that there may be a better proof
of his faith and good conversation.  For otherwise he is a neophyte.*

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p12"></span>This is Canon XIII. of Dionysius,
Isidore, and the *Prisca*.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p13"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.x-p13.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p14"></span>By *Scholasticus de foro*
\[“professional advocate”\] must be understood an eloquent pleader of
difficult causes, who being bound up in forensic disputes and strifes,
may be presumed to be little fitted for the priesthood, and therefore to
need a more strict examination.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p15"></span>The Synodal approbation is lacking in
Dionysius as given by Justellus, as well as in that of the Roman Code,
but is found in Labbe’s reprint of Dionysius and Isidore.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.x-p16"></span>This Canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, P. I., Dist. lxj., c. x.
