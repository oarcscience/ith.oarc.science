<span id="vii.vi.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xv-p2.1"></span>If</span> any who have lapsed have been
ordained through the ignorance, or even with the previous knowledge of
the ordainers, this shall not prejudice the canon of the Church; for
when they are discovered they shall be deposed.

<span id="vii.vi.xv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.xv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon X.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.xv-p5"></span>Whoso had lapsed are to be deposed
whether those who ordained and promoted them did so conscious of their
guilt or unknowing of it.

<span id="vii.vi.xv-p7"></span>The tenth canon differs from the ninth,
inasmuch as it concerns only the *lapsi* and their elevation, not only
to the priesthood, but to any other ecclesiastical preferment as well,
and requires their deposition.  The punishment of a bishop who should
consciously perform such an ordination is not mentioned; but it is
incontestable that the *lapsi* could not be ordained, even after having
performed penance; for, as the preceding canon states, the Church
requires those who were faultless.  It is to be observed that the word
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.xv-p7.1"></span>προχειρίζειν</span>
is evidently employed here in the sense of “ordain,” and is used without
any distinction from <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xv-p7.2"></span>χειρίζειν</span>, whilst in the synodal
letter of the Council of Nicæa on the subject of the Meletians, there is
a distinction between these two words, and <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.xv-p7.3"></span>προχειρίζειν</span> is used to signify
*eligere*.

<span id="vii.vi.xv-p8"></span>This canon is found in *Corpus Juris
Canonici*.  *Decretum*.  Pars I.  Dist. lxxxi.  c.v.
