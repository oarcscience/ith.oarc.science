id="xvii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Of the Same to the Bishops of Libya and
Pentapolis.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxxi-p2"></span>There is another Epistle of the same
father, complaining to the bishops of Libya and Pentapolis.  That some
who had been refused ordination by their own bishop, or cast out of the
monasteries for their irregularity, were ordained by a surprise upon
some other bishop, and that just as they came from their bride-bed, and
then went and performed the oblation, or any other office, in the
monasteries from which they had been ejected, which gave great offence. 
He charges the bishops to take care of this for the future and, if any
were to be ordained, to enquire into their lives, and whether they are
married, and when, and how; and orders, that catechumens, who had been
separated for lapsing, be baptized at the hour of death.
