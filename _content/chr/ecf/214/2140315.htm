<p class="c31"><a name="xi.xv-p3"></A>(Labbe and Cossart, <i>Concilia</i>, Tom. IV., col. 618.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xv-p4"></A>The most magnificent and glorious judges said:&#8230;The arrangement arrived at through the agreement of the most holy Maximus, the bishop of the city of Antioch, and of the most holy Juvenal, the bishop of Jerusalem, as the attestation of each of them declares, shall remain firm for ever, through our decree and the sentence of the holy synod; to wit, that the most holy bishop Maximus, or rather the most holy church of Antioch, shall have under its own jurisdiction the two Ph&#339;nicias and Arabia; but the most holy Juvenal, bishop of Jerusalem, or rather the most holy Church which is under him, shall have under his own power the three Palestines, all imperial pragmatics and letters and penalties being done away according to the bidding of our most sacred and pious prince.</p> 
<p class="c31"><a name="xi.xv-p5"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xi.xv-p5.1"></A>Note.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xv-p6"></A>The Ballerini, in their notes to the Works of St. Leo (Migne, <i>Pat. Lat</i>., LV., col. 733 <i>et seqq</i>.), cite fragments of the Acts of this council, which if they can be trusted, shew that this matter of the rights of Antioch and Jerusalem was treated of again at a subsequent session (on Oct. 31) and determined in the same fashion.&#160; These fragments have generally been received as genuine, and have been inserted by Mansi (Tom. vii., 722 C.) in his <i>Concilia</i>.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xi.xv-p7"></A>The notes of the Ballerini may also be read with profit, in the same volume of Migne&#146;s <i>Latin Patrology</i>, col. 737 <i>et seq</i>.</p>
