XXXIII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxviii-p5"></span>Thou shalt not pray with

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxviii-p7"></span>The underlying principle of
this canon is the same as the last, for as the receiving of <span
id="page_150">p. 150</span> <span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxviii-Page_150"></span>the Eulogiæ which were sent by
heretics as a sign of communion, signified a communion with them in
religious matters, so the sharing with them common prayer is a
declaration of the same communion, and therefore to be avoided.  This is
also set forth in Apostolical Canon number xlv.
