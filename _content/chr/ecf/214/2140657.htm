<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p11"></A>Never was a more impartial law made, especially when all the legislators were bishops except two.&#160; There were 217 bishops, and two priests, being legates from the bishop of Rome.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxxxiv-p12"></A>The Greeks make a canon of the ratifications, and reckon no more than 135.&#160; Aurelius, Bishop of Carthage, subscribes first, and after him 217 bishops, then Asellus and Philippus, priests, legates of the church of Rome.&#160; And it does not appear that any other priests were present in any of the councils, mentioned in the body of this code; but there is several times notice taken of the deacons who stood by.</p>
