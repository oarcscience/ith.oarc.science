<span id="viii.vii.iii.vi-p7"></span>This canon calls elections “laying
on of hands,” and says that since in elections un<span id="page_127">p.
127</span> <span id="viii.vii.iii.vi-Page_127"></span>worthy things are
often said with regard to those who are elected, therefore they should
not take place in the presence of any that might happen to come to hear.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vi-p8"></span>Zonaras also agrees that election
is here intended, but Aristenus dissents and makes the reference to
ordinations properly so-called, as follows:

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vi-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.vi-p9.1"></span>Aristenus.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.vi-p10"></span>The prayers of ordination are not
to be said out loud so that they may be heard by the people.
