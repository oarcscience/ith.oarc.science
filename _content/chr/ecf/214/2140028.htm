<p class="c35"><a name="vii.vi.x-p5"></A>Let the Bishop of &AElig;lia be honoured, the rights of the Metropolis being preserved intact.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="vii.vi.x-p6"></A>There would seem to be a singular fitness in the Holy City Jerusalem holding a very exalted position among the sees of Christendom, and it may appear astonishing that in the earliest times it was only a suffragan see to the great Church of C&aelig;sarea.&#160; It must be remembered, however, that only about seventy years after our Lord&#146;s death the city of Jerusalem was entirely destroyed and ploughed as a field according to the prophet.&#160; As a holy city Jerusalem was a thing of the past for long years, and it is only in the beginning of the second century that we find a strong Christian Church growing up in the rapidly increasing city, called no longer Jerusalem, but &AElig;lia Capitolina.&#160; Possibly by the end of the second century the idea of the holiness of the site began to lend dignity to the occupant of the see; at all events Eusebius&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A>
 tells us that &#8220;at a synod held on the subject of the Easter controversy in the time of Pope Victor, Theophilus of C&aelig;sarea and Narcissus of Jerusalem were presidents.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="vii.vi.x-p8"></A>It was this feeling of reverence which induced the passing of this seventh canon.&#160; It is very hard to determine just what was the &#8220;precedence&#8221; granted to the Bishop of &AElig;lia, nor is it clear which is the metropolis referred to in the last clause.&#160; Most writers, including Hefele, Balsamon, Aristenus and Beveridge consider it to be C&aelig;sarea; while Zonaras thinks Jerusalem to be intended, a view recently adopted and defended by Fuchs;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A>
 others again suppose it is Antioch that is referred to.</p>
