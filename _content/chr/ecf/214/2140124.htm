<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.xiii-p7"></A>The synodal letter in its sixth article also speaks of this.&#160; Exchange of dress, or the adoption by one sex of the dress of the other, was forbidden in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#005">Deut. xxii. 5</a><a name="viii.v.iv.xiii-p7.1"></A>), and was therefore most strictly interdicted by the whole ancient Church.&#160; Such <A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A> <a name="viii.v.iv.xiii-Page_98"></A>change of attire was formerly adopted mainly for theatrical purposes, or from effeminacy, wantonness, the furtherance of unchastity, or the like.&#160; The Eustathians, from quite opposite and hyper-ascetical reasons, had recommended women to assume male, that is probably monk&#146;s attire, in order to show that for them, as the holy ones, there was no longer any distinction of sex; but the Church, also from ascetical reasons, forbade this change of attire, especially when joined to superstition and puritanical pride.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.xiii-p8"></A>This canon is found in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratian&#146;s <i>Decretum</i>, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. vi.</p>
