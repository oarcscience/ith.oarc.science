<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.li-p7"></A>It is doubtful whether by the Thursday of the text was meant only the Thursday of Holy Week, or every Thursday of the time during which the catechumens received instruction.&#160; The Greek commentators are in favour of the latter, but Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore, and after them Bingham, are, and probably rightly, in favour of the former meaning.&#160; This canon was repeated by the Trullan Synod in its seventy-eighth canon.</p>
