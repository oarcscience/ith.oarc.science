id="viii.vii.iii.xxi-p2.1"></span>After</span> the sermons of the
Bishops, the prayer for the catechumens is to be made first by itself;
and after the catechumens have gone out, the prayer for those who are
under penance; and, after these have passed under the hand \[of the
Bishop\] and departed, there should then be offered the three prayers of
the faithful, the first to be said entirely in silence, the second and
third aloud, and then the \[kiss of\] peace is to be given.  And, after
the presbyters have given the \[kiss of\] peace to the Bishop, then the
laity are to give it \[to one another\], and so the Holy Oblation is to
be completed.  And it is lawful to the priesthood alone to go to the
Altar and \[there\] communicate.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxi-p5"></span>After the prayers of the
catechumens shall be said those of the Penitents, and afterwards those
of the faithful.  And after the peace, or embrace, has been given, the
offering shall be made.  Only priests shall enter the sanctuary and make
there their communion.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxi-p6"></span>The Greek commentators throw but
little if any light upon this canon.  A question has been raised as to
who said the prayers mentioned.  Van Espen, following Isidore’s
translation “they also pray who are doing penance,” thinks the prayer of
the penitents, said by themselves, is intended, and not the prayer said
by the Bishop.  But Hefele, following Dionysius’s version—“the prayers
over the catechumens,” “over those who are doing penance”—thinks that
the liturgical prayers are intended, which after the sermon were wont to
be said “over” the different classes.  Dionysius does not say “over” the
faithful, but describes them as “the prayers of the faithful,” which
Hefele thinks means that the faithful joined in reciting them.
