id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p2.1"></span>If</span> any persons who profess
virginity shall disregard their profession, let them fulfil the term of
digamists.  And, moreover, we prohibit women who are virgins from living
with men as sisters.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p5"></span>*Whoever has professed virginity
and afterwards annuls it, let him be cut off for four years.  And
virgins shall not go* <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117) *to any as

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p8"></span>According to some of the ancient
canons digamists were to be suspended from communion for one or two
years, though Beveridge and others doubt whether the rule was not meant
to apply to such marriages only as were contracted before a former one
was dissolved.  Bingham thinks that it was intended to discountenance
marrying after an unlawful divorce.  (*Ant*., Bk. xv, c. iv., §
18.) <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118)

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p10.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p11"></span>The first part of this canon
regards all young persons—men as well as women—who have taken a vow of
virginity, and who, having thus, so to speak, betrothed themselves to
God are guilty of a *quasi* digamy in violating that promise.  They must
therefore incur the punishment of digamy (*successiva*) which, according
to St. Basil the Great, consisted of one year’s seclusion.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p12"></span>This canon is found in Gratian’s
*Decretum* (P. II., Causa xxvii., Q. i., c. xxiv.) as follows:  “As many
as have professed virginity and have broken their vow and contemned
their profession shall be treated as digamists, that is as those who
have contracted a second marriage.”

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p6"></span> Aristenus understands this to
mean to “live with,” using the verb <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p6.1"></span>συναναστρέφεσθαι</span>.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[71:119](2140080.htm#fr_118) <span
id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xix-p9"></span> This view of Bingham’s would seem
to be untenable, since the penance would have been for adultery not for
digamy had the former marriage still been in force.
