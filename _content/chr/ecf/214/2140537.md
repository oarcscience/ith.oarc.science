<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xiv-p1.1"></span>Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiv-p2"></span>That a bishop should not be ordained
except by many bishops, but if there should be necessity he may be
ordained by three.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xiv-p3.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xiv-p3.2"></span>Aurelius</span> said:  What says your
holiness on this matter?  By all the bishops it was answered:  The
decrees of the ancients must be observed by us, to wit, that without the
consent of the Primate of any province even many bishops assembled
together should not lightly presume to ordain a bishop.  But should
there be a necessity, at his bidding, three bishops should ordain him in
any place they happen to be, and if anyone contrary to his profession
and subscription shall come into any place he shall thereby deprive
himself of his honour.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiv-p6"></span>At the bidding of the Primate even
three bishops can make a bishop.  But whoever goes counter to his
profession, and subscription, is deprived of his honour by his own
judgment.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiv-p7"></span>This is Canon xij. of the before
mentioned Synod of 387 or 390.
