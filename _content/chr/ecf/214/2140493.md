id="xv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Note on the Text of the Canons.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iii-p2"></span>The Canons of Sardica have come down to
us both in Greek and Latin, and some writers such as Richer (*Histoire
Conc. Générale*, Tom. i., p. 98), have been of opinion that the Latin
text alone was the original, while others, such as Walch (*Gesch. der
Kirchenvers*., p. 179), have arrived at a directly opposite conclusion. 
Now, however, chiefly owing to the investigations of the Ballerini and
of Spittler, the unanimous opinion of scholars—so says Hefele—is that
the canons were originally drawn up in both languages, intended as they
were for both Latins and Greeks.  I may perhaps remind the reader that
in many Western collections of canons the canons of Sardica immediately
follow those of Nice without any break, or note that they were not
enacted at that council.  It will also be well to bear in mind that they
were received by the Greeks as of Ecumenical authority by the Council in
Trullo, and as such are contained in the body of the Greek Canon Law.

<span id="xv.iii.iii-p3"></span>I have provided the reader with a very
accurate translation of each text.
