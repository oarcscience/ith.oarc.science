id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxiv-p1.1"></span>Canon LXXXIII.  (Greek lxxxvi.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxiv-p2"></span>Of false Memories of Martyrs.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxiv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxiv-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good that the
altars which have been set up here and there, in fields and by the
wayside as Memories of Martyrs, in which no body nor reliques of martyrs
can be proved to have been laid up, should be overturned by the bishops
who rule over such places, if such a thing can be done.  But should this
be impossible on account of the popular tumult it would arouse, the
people should none the less be admonished not to frequent such places,
and that those who believe rightly should be held bound by no
superstition of the place.  And no memory of martyrs should at all be
accepted, unless where there is found the body or some reliques, on
which is declared traditionally and by good authority to have been
originally his habitation, or possession, or the scene of his passion. 
For altars which have been erected anywhere on account of dreams or
inane *quasi*-revelations of certain people, should be in every way
disapproved of.

LXXXIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxiv-p6"></span>An altar in the fields or in a
vineyard which lacks the reliques of the martyrs should be thrown down
unless it would cause a public tumult to do so:  and the same is the
case with such as have been set up on account of dreams and false
revelations.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxiv-p7"></span>This is Canon xvij. of Carthage,
September, <span class="sc"><span
