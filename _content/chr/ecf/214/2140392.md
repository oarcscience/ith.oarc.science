id="xiv.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>Since</span> we desire that in every point
the things which have been decreed by our holy fathers may also be
established and confirmed, we hereby renew the canon which orders that
synods of the bishops of each province be held every year where the
bishop of the metropolis shall deem best.  But since on account of the
incursions of barbarians and certain other incidental causes, those who
preside over the churches cannot hold synods twice a year, it seems
right that by all means once a year—on account of ecclesiastical
questions which are likely to arise—a synod of the aforesaid bishops
should be holden in every province, between the holy feast of Easter and
October, as has been said above, in the place which the Metropolitan
shall have deemed most fitting.  And let such bishops as do not attend,
when they are at home in their own cities and are in good health, and
free from all unavoidable and necessary business, be fraternally
reproved.

id="xiv.iii.ix-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.ix-p5"></span>Whenever it is impossible to hold two
synods a year, one at least shall be celebrated, between Easter and the
month of October.

<span id="xiv.iii.ix-p6"></span>This canon under the name of the “Sixth
Synod” is referred to in Canon VI. of the Seventh Ecumenical Council
(II. Nice), and the bishops of Quinisext are called “Fathers.”

<span id="xiv.iii.ix-p8"></span>What at first was only allowed on
account of necessity, little by little passed into general law, and at
last was received as law, that once a year there was to be a meeting of
the provincial synod.
