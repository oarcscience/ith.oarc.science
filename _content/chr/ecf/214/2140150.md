id="viii.vi.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span>No</span> bishop shall presume to pass
from one province to another, and ordain persons to the dignity of the
ministry in the Church, not even should he have others with him, unless
he should go at the written invitation of the metropolitan and bishops
into whose country he goes.  But if he should, without invitation,
proceed irregularly to the ordination of any, or to the regulation of
ecclesiastical affairs which do not concern him, the things done by him
are null, and he himself shall suffer the due punishment of his
irregularity and his unreasonable undertaking, by being forthwith
deposed by the holy Synod.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xiii-p5"></span>If without invitation a bishop
shall go into another province, and shall ordain, and administer
affairs, what he does shall be void and he himself shall be deposed.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xiii-p6"></span>Compare with this Apostolic Canon
xxxv.; also canon xxii. of this same synod.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xiii-p7"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa ix., Quæst. II.,
Can. vj. in the *Versio Prisca*.  The Roman Correctors are not satisfied
with it, however, nor with any version and give the Greek text, to which
they add an accurate translation.
