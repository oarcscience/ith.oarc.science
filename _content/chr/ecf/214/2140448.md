<span id="xiv.iii.lxv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxv-p1.1"></span>Canon LXIV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.lxv-p2.1"></span>It</span> does not befit a layman to
dispute or teach publicly, thus claiming for himself authority to teach,
but he should yield to the order appointed by the Lord, and to open his
ears to those who have received the grace to teach, and be taught by
them divine things; for in one Church God has made “different members,”
according to the word of the Apostle:  and Gregory the Theologian,
wisely interpreting this passage, commends the order in vogue with them
saying: <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378)   “This order brethren
we revere, this we guard.  Let this one be the ear; that one the tongue,
the hand or any other member.  Let this one teach, but let that one
learn.”  And a little further on:  “Learning in docility and abounding
in cheerfulness, and ministering with alacrity, we shall not all be the
tongue which is the more active member, not all of us Apostles, not all
prophets, nor shall we all interpret.”  And again:  “Why dost thou make
thyself a shepherd when thou art a sheep?  Why become the head when thou
art a foot?  Why dost thou try to be a commander when thou art enrolled
in the number of the soldiers?”  And elsewhere:  “Wisdom orders, Be not
swift in words; nor compare thyself with the rich, being poor; nor seek
to be wiser than the wise.”  But if any one be found weakening the
present canon, he is to be cut off for forty days.

id="xiv.iii.lxv-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LXIV.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.lxv-p6"></span>A layman shall not teach, for all are
not prophets, nor all apostles.

<span id="xiv.iii.lxv-p7"></span>Zonaras points out that this canon
refers only to public instruction and not to private.  Van Espen further
notes that in the West this restriction is limited to the solemn and
public preaching and announcing of the Word of God, which is restricted
to bishops, and only by special and express license given to the other
clergy, and refers to his own treatment of the subject *In jure
Eccles.*, Tom I., part 1, tit. xvj., cap. viij.
