<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p2"></A>That bishops be not detained too long in council, let them choose three judges from themselves of the singular provinces.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxxviii-p3.1"></A>Item</span>, it seemed good, lest all the bishops who are assembled at a council be kept too long, that the whole synod should choose three judges of the several provinces; and they elected for the province of Carthage Vincent, Fortunatian, and Clarus; for the province of Numidia Alypius, Augustine, and Restitutus; for the province of Byzacena, with the holy Senex Donatian the Primate, Cresconius, Jocundus, and &AElig;milian; for Mauritania Sitephensis Severian, Asiaticus, and Donatus; for the Tripolitan province Plautius, who alone was sent as legate according to custom; all these were to take cognizance of all things with the holy senex Aurelius, from whom the whole council sought that he should subscribe all things done by the council whether acts or letters.&#160; And they subscribed:&#160; I, Aurelius, bishop of the church of Carthage consent to this decree and having read it sign my name.&#160; Likewise also signed they all.</p>
