<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Canon XLVII.  (Greek li.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p2"></span>*Concerning \[the Donatists
and* <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446) *\] the children baptized
by the Donatists.*

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p4.1"></span>Concerning</span> the Donatists <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447) it seemed good that we should hold
counsel with our brethren and fellow priests Siricius and Simplician
concerning those infants alone who are baptized by Donatists: <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448)   lest what they did not do of their
own will, when they should be converted to the Church of God with a
salutary determination, the error of their parents might prevent their
promotion to the ministry of the holy altar.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p7"></span>But when these things had been
begun, Honoratus and Urbanus, bishops of Mauri<span id="page_464">p.
464</span> <span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-Page_464"></span>tania Sitifensis,
said:  When some time ago we were sent to your holiness, we laid aside
what things had been written on this account, that we might wait for the
arrival of our brethren the legates from Numidia.  But because not a few
days have passed in which they have been looked for and as yet they are
not arrived, it is not fitting that we should delay any longer the
commands we received from our brother-bishops; and therefore, brethren,
receive our story with alacrity of mind.  We have heard concerning the
faith of the Nicene tractate:  True it is that sacrifices are to be
forbidden after breakfast, so that they may be offered as is right by
those who are fasting, and this has been confirmed then and now.

id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p8.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p9"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p9.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLVII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p10"></span>When those in infancy baptized by
Donatists are converted, this shall be no impediment to them.  And the
Holy Mysteries, as is right, are to be celebrated only by them fasting.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p11"></span>This canon is made from Canon
xxxvij. of the Synod of Hippo, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p11.1"></span>a.d.</span> 393, and from Canon j. of
the Synod of Carthage of August 28th, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p11.2"></span>a.d.</span> 397.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p13"></span>See Can. 41.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p14"></span>The pretence that the Donatists
had for making a schism was, that Cæcilian, Bishop of Carthage, had, in
the time of persecution, been a *Traditor*, i.e., given up the Bible to
the heathen inquisitors; this was denied by the Orthodox, who charged
them with the same crime in effect, viz. of being too favourable to the
*Traditors*, and those that had lapsed.  They likewise are charged with
Arianism.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xlviii-p15"></span>I have omitted what is here
mentioned concerning the Council of Nice; because I do not find that any
one has been able to penetrate into the meaning of the Fathers as to
that particular.
