<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxxx-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxxx-p3.1"></A>To</span> all it seemed good that no slaves or freedmen, properly so called, be admitted to accusation nor any of those who by the public laws are debarred from bringing accusation in criminal proceedings.&#160; This also is the case with all those who have the stain of infamy, that is actors, and persons subject to turpitudes, also heretics, or heathen, or Jews; but even all those to whom the right of bringing accusation is denied, are not forbidden to bring accusation in their own suits.</p>
