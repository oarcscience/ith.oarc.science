<p class="c34"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p1"></A> <span class="c4"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p1.1"></A>Canon CXV.&#160; (Greek cxvi.)</span></p> 
<p class="c50"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p2"></A>That in the Lord&#146;s Prayer the Saints say for themselves:&#160; &#8220;Forgive us our trespasses.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p3.1"></A>It</span> has seemed good that whoever should say that when in the Lord&#146;s prayer, the saints say, &#8220;forgive us our trespasses,&#8221; they say this not for themselves, because they have no need of this petition, but for the rest who are sinners of the people; and that <A NAME="page_499"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 499</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-Page_499"></A>therefore no one of the saints can say, &#8220;Forgive me my trespasses,&#8221; but &#8220;Forgive us our trespasses;&#8221; so that the just is understood to seek this for others rather than for himself; let him be anathema.&#160; For holy and just was the Apostle James, when he said, &#8220;For in many things we offend all.&#8221;&#160; For why was it added &#8220;all,&#8221; unless that this sentence might agree also with the psalm, where we read, &#8220;Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified;&#8221; and in the prayer of the most wise Solomon:&#160; &#8220;There is no man that sinneth not;&#8221; and in the book of the holy Job:&#160; &#8220;He sealeth in the hand of every man, that every man may know his own infirmity;&#8221; wherefore even the holy and just Daniel when in prayer said several times:&#160; &#8220;We have sinned, we have done iniquity,&#8221; and other things which there truly and humbly he confessed; nor let it be thought (as some have thought) that this was said not of his own but rather of the people&#146;s sins, for he said further on:&#160; &#8220;When I shall pray and confess my sins and the sins of my people to the Lord my God;&#8221; he did not wish to say our sins, but he said the sins of his people and his own sins, since he as a prophet foresaw that those who were to come would thus misunderstand his words.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxvi-p6"></A>Whoso expounds this, &#8220;forgive us our trespasses&#8221; as speaking only of the multitude and not of individuals let him be anathema:&#160; Since Daniel even he can behold saying with the multitude &#8220;I confessed my sins and the sins of my people.&#8221;</p>
