id="xiv.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>If</span> a presbyter has through
ignorance contracted an illegal marriage, while he still retains the
right to his place, as we have defined in the sacred canons, yet he must
abstain from all sacerdotal work.  For it is sufficient if to such an
one indulgence is granted.  For he is unfit to bless another who needs
to take care of his own wounds, for blessing is the imparting of
sanctification.  But how can he impart this to another who does not
possess it himself through a sin of ignorance?  Neither then in public
nor in private can he bless nor distribute to others the body of Christ,
\[nor perform any other ministry\]; but being content with his seat of
honour let him lament to the Lord that his sin of ignorance may be
remitted.  For it is manifest that the nefarious marriage must be
dissolved, neither can the man have any intercourse with her on account
of whom he is deprived of the execution of his priesthood.

id="xiv.iii.xxvii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xxvii-p5"></span>A priest who has fallen into an
illicit marriage and been deposed, may still have his seat, but only
when he abstains for the future from his wickedness.

<span id="xiv.iii.xxvii-p7"></span>If any presbyter before his
ordination had married a widow, or a harlot, or an actress, or any other
woman such as are forbidden, in ignorance, he shall cease from his
priesthood but shall still have his place among the presbyters.  But
such an illegitimate marriage, on account of which he was deprived of
the Sacred Ministry, must be dissolved.

here refers is number xxvij. of St. Basil in his Canonical Epistle to
Amphilochius.
