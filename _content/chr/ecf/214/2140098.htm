<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iv.iii.vii-p5"></A><i>A presbyter ought not to be present at the marriage of digamists.&#160; For when that one</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A>
 <i>implores favour, who will deem him worthy of favour.</i></p> 
<p class="c36"><a name="viii.iv.iii.vii-p7"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iv.iii.vii-p7.1"></A>Hefele.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iv.iii.vii-p8"></A>The meaning of the canon is as follows:&#160; &#8220;If the digamist, after contracting his second marriage, comes to the priest to be told the punishment he has to undergo, how stands the priest himself who for the sake of the feast has become his accomplice in the offence?&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c36"><a name="viii.iv.iii.vii-p9"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iv.iii.vii-p9.1"></A>Van Espen.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iv.iii.vii-p10"></A>The present canon again shews that although the Church never disapproved of, nor reputed second or still later marriages illicit, nevertheless the Fathers enjoined a penance upon digamists and those repeating marriage, because by this iteration they shewed their incontinence.&#160; As he that contracted a second marriage did not sin properly speaking, and committed no fault worthy of punishment, therefore whatever was amiss was believed to be paid off by a lighter penance, and Zonaras supposes that the canons inflicted a mulct upon digamists, for saith he, &#8220;Digamists are not allowed for one year to receive the Holy Gifts.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="viii.iv.iii.vii-p11"></A>Zonaras seems to indicate that the discipline of the canon was not in force in his time, for he says, &#8220;Although this is found in our writings, yet we ourselves have seen the Patriarch and many Metropolitans present at the feast for the second nuptials of the Emperor.&#8221;</p>
