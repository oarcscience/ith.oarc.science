<span id="xvii.viii-p6"></span>Involuntary nocturnal pollutions are not
sinful, \[I add to Johnson the exact words of the Saint.  “For what sin
or uncleanness can any natural excrement have in itself?  Think of the
absurdity of making a sin of the wax which comes from the ears or of the
spittle from the mouth.  Moreover we might add many things and explain
how the excretions from the <span id="page_603">p. 603</span> <span
id="xvii.viii-Page_603"></span>belly are necessary to animal life.  But
if we believe that man is the work of God’s hand, as we are taught in
holy Scripture, how can it be supposed necessary that we perform
anything impure?  And if we are the children of God, as the holy Acts of
the Apostles teaches, we have in us nothing unclean, etc., etc.”\]; nor
is matrimony unclean, though virginity \[“which is angelic and than
which nothing can be more excellent”\] is to be preferred before it.
