<p class="c19"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xx-p4"></A>All said:&#160; Such is our pleasure.</p> 
<p class="c31"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xx-p5"></A>(This canon is wanting in the <i>Latin</i>.)</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xx-p8"></A>A clergyman who does not live in the Church among whose clergy he is enrolled should not be received.&#160; Eutychian and Mus&aelig;us shall not have the name of bishops.&#160; But let them be admitted to communion with the laity, if they wish.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xx-p9"></A>Both of these canons are lacking in the Latin.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.xx-p11"></A>It is clear that the reason why these two canons do not exist in the Latin text is that they did not apply to the Latin Church and only contained a special rule for Thessalonica.</p>
