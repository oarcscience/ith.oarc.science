<p class="c18"><a name="xii.xi-p4"></A>At last the Pope Vigilius resigned himself to the advice of the Council, and six months afterwards wrote a letter to the Patriarch Eutychius, wherein he confesses that he has been wanting in charity in dividing from his brethren.&#160; He adds, that one ought not to be ashamed to retract, when one recognises the truth, and brings forward the example of Augustine.&#160; He says, that, after having better examined the matter of the Three Chapters, he finds them worthy of condemnation.&#160; &#8220;We recognize for our brethren and colleagues all those who have condemned them, and annul by this writing all that has been done by us or by others for the defence of the three chapters.&#8221;</p>
