<p class="c18"><a name="x.x-p4"></A>[<i>No action is recorded in the Acts as having been taken.&#160; A verbal report was made by certain who had seen Nestorius during the past three days, that they were hopeless of any repentance on his part.&#160; On the motion of Flavian, bishop of Philippi, a number of passages from the Fathers were read; and after that some selections from the writings of Nestorius.&#160; A letter from Capreolus, Archbishop of Carthage, was next read, excusing his absence; after the reading of the letter, which makes no direct reference to Nestorius whatever, but prays the Synod to see to it that no novelties be tolerated, the Acts proceed</i>.&#160; (Col. 534<a name="x.x-p4.1"></A>).]</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.x-p5"></A>Cyril, the bishop of the Church of Alexandria, said:&#160; As this letter of the most reverend and pious Capreolus, bishop of Carthage, which has been read, contains a most lucid expression of opinion, let it be inserted in the Acts.&#160; For it wishes that the ancient dogmas of the faith should be confirmed, and that novelties, absurdly conceived and impiously brought forth, should be reprobated and proscribed.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.x-p6"></A>All the bishops at the same time cried out:&#160; These are the sentiments (<span class="Greek"><a name="x.x-p6.1"></A>&#966;&#969;&#957;&#945;&#8055;</span>) of all of us, these are the things we all say&#8212;the accomplishment of this is the desire of us all.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.x-p7"></A>[<i>Immediately follows the sentence of deposition and the subscriptions.&#160; It seems almost certain that something has dropped out here, most probably the whole discussion of Cyril&#146;s XII. Anathematisms</i>.]</p>
