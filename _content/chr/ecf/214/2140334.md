<span id="xi.xviii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xvi-p2.1"></span>It</span> is not lawful for a virgin who
has dedicated herself to the Lord God, nor for monks, to marry; and if
they are found to have done this, let them be excommunicated.  But we
decree that in every place the bishop shall have the power of indulgence
towards them.

<span id="xi.xviii.xvi-p5"></span>Monks or nuns shall not contract
marriage, and if they do so let them be excommunicated.

<span id="xi.xviii.xvi-p7"></span>Since this canon says nothing at all
of separation in connexion with a marriage made contrary to a vow, but
only orders separation from communion, it seems very likely that vows of
this kind at the time of the synod were not considered diriment but only
impedient impediments from which the bishop of the diocese could
dispense at least as far as the canonical punishment was concerned.

<span id="xi.xviii.xvi-p9"></span>The last part of the canon gives the
bishop authority in certain circumstances not to inflict the
excommunication which is threatened in the first part, or again to
remove it.  Thus all the old Latin translators understood our text; but
Dionysius Exiguus and the *Prisca* added *confitentibus*, meaning, “if
such a virgin or monk *confess and repent* their fault, then the bishop
may be kind to them.”  That the marriage of a monk is invalid, as was
ruled by later ecclesiastical law, our canon does not say; on the
contrary, it assumes its validity, as also the marriages contracted by
priests until the beginning of the twelfth century were regarded as
valid.

<span id="xi.xviii.xvi-p10"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa xxvii., Quæst.
I., canon xxii., from Isidore’s version; it is also found in Dionysius’s
version as canon xij. of the same Quæstio, Causa, and Part, where it is
said to be taken “ex Concilio Triburiensi.”
