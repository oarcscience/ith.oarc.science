<span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVI.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p5"></span>*The Gospel, the Epistle* \[<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p5.1"></span>ἀπόστολος</span>
\] *and the other Scriptures are to be read on the Sabbath.*

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p7"></span>Before the arrangement of the
Ecclesiastical Psalmody was settled, neither the Gospel nor the other
Scriptures were accustomed to be read on the Sabbath.  But out of regard
to the canons which forbade fasting or kneeling on the Sabbath, there
were no services, so that there might be as much feasting as possible. 
This the fathers prohibit, and decree that on the Sabbath the whole
ecclesiastical office shall be said.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p8"></span>Neander (*Kirchengesch*., 2d ed.,
vol. iij., p. 565 *et seq*.) suggests in addition to the interpretation
just given another, viz.:  that it was the custom in many parts of the
ancient Church to keep every Saturday as a feast in commemoration of the
Creation.  Neander also suggests that possibly some Judaizers read on
the Sabbath only the Old Testament; he, however, himself remarks that in
this case <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p8.1"></span>εὐαγγέλια</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p8.2"></span>ἑτέρων
γραφῶν</span> would require the article.

id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p9.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p10"></span>Among the Greeks the Sabbath was
kept exactly as the Lord’s day except so far as the cessation of work
was concerned, wherefore the Council wishes that, as on Sundays, after
the other lessons there should follow the Gospel.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p11"></span>For it is evident that by the
intention of the Church the whole Divine Office was designed for the
edification and instruction of the people, and especially was this the
case on feast days, when the people were apt to be present in large
numbers.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p12"></span>Here we may note the origin of
our present \[Western\] discipline, by which on Sundays and feast days
the Gospel is wont to be read with the other Scriptures in the canonical
hours, while such is not the case on ferial days, or in the order for
ferias and “simples.” <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176)

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xvii-p13"></span> “Simples” (*simplici*) are
distinguished from “doubles” (*duplici*) in not having their antiphons
said double but only once.
