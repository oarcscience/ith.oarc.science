<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p1.1"></span>Canon LVII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p2.1"></span>Bishops</span> must not be appointed
in villages or country districts, but visitors; and those who have been
already appointed must do nothing without the consent of the bishop of
the city.  Presbyters, in like manner, must do nothing without the
consent of the bishop.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LVII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p5"></span>A bishop shall not be established
in a village or in the country, but a periodeutes.  But should one be
appointed he shall not perform any function without the bishop of the
city.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p6"></span>On the whole subject of
Chorepiscopi see the Excursus to Canon VIII. of Nice, in this volume.

id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p7.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p8"></span>Compare the eighth and tenth
canons of the Synod of Antioch of 341, the thirteenth of the Synod of
Ancyra, and the second clause of the sixth canon of the Synod of
Sardica.  The above canon orders that from henceforth, in the place of
the rural bishops, priests of higher rank shall act as visitors of the
country dioceses and country clergy.  Dionysius Exiguus, Isidore, the
Greek commentators, Van Espen, Remi Ceillier, Neander, and others thus
interpret this canon; but Herbst, in the *Tübingen Review*, translates
the word (<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p8.1"></span>περιοδευταί</span> ) not visitors but
physicians—physicians of the soul,—and for this he appeals to passages
from the Fathers of the Church collected by Suicer in his *Thesaurus*.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p9"></span>This canon is found in the
*Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. LXXX., c.
v.
