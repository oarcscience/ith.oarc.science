<span id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p1.1"></span>Canon CVII.  (Greek cx.
continued.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p2"></span>A Council concerning a bishop taking
cognizance.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p3.1"></span>In</span> the consulate of the most
glorious Emperors Honorius for the <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p3.2"></span>VII</span>th time and Theodosius for the
IIId, Augusti, xvii. Calends of July, a synod was held at Carthage in
the basilica of the second region.  In this council it seemed good that
no one bishop <span id="page_496">p. 496</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-Page_496"></span>should claim the right to take
cognizance of a cause.  The acts of this council I have not here written
down, because it was only provincial and not general.

id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon CVII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p5"></span>One bishop shall not claim for
himself to take cognizance of a cause alone.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p6"></span>(Greek cxi.)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p7"></span>Synod against the Donatists.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p8"></span>After the consulate of the most
illustrious Emperors Honorius for the <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p8.1"></span>VIII</span>th time and Theodosius for
the <span class="sc"><span id="xv.iv.iv.cviii-p8.2"></span>IV</span>th
time, Augusti, xviii. Calends of July, at Carthage in the basilica of
the second region.  In this council the bishops, Florentius, Possidius,
Præsidius and Benenatus received legation against the Donatists, at that
time at which a law was given that anyone might practice the Christian
worship at his own will.
