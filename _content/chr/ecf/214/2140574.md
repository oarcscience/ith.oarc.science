<span id="xv.iv.iv.li-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.li-p1.1"></span>Canon L.  (Greek liv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.li-p2"></span>How many bishops should be added to the
number of those ordaining, if any opposition had been made to the one to
be ordained.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.li-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.li-p3.1"></span>But</span> this should be decreed, that
when we shall have met together to choose a bishop, if any opposition
shall arise, because such things have been treated by us, the three
shall not presume to purge <span id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451) him
who was to be ordained, but one or two more shall be asked to be added
to the aforesaid number, and the persons of those objecting shall first
be discussed in the same place (*plebe*) for which he was to be
ordained.  And last of all the objections shall be considered; and only
after he has been cleared in the <span id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.li-Page_466"></span>public sight shall he at last be
ordained.  If this agrees with the mind of your holiness, let it be
confirmed by the answer of your worthiness.  All the bishops said, We
are well pleased.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.li-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.li-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon L.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.li-p7"></span>If any controversy arise concerning a
bishop who has been elected by three bishops, let two others be coöpted,
and so let there be an examination made of his affairs; and if it shall
appear that he is pure, let him be ordained.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.li-p8"></span>This canon is Canon iij., of the Synod
of Carthage, Aug. 28th, 397.

id="xv.iv.iv.li-p9.1"></span>Johnson.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.li-p10"></span>Here the bishops meet to choose a new
one, and it is evident by the foregoing canon, that they met not in the
vacant church, but in that of the Primate; and that therefore not the
people, but the bishops had the chief share in the election.  The people
might make their objections, which supposes they knew who their intended
bishop was; but the bishops were the judges of the cause.  And it seems
probable, that if there were any dispute, some of the bishops went to
the vacant church to hear the allegations against the person that was
elected, or proposed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_451"></span>[465:452](2140574.htm#fr_451) <span
id="xv.iv.iv.li-p3.2"></span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.li-p4"></span> The Greek reads “to depose him,” and
varies considerably from the Latin.  I have followed the Latin but
confess that in part I have failed to catch a meaning.  The Greek is
perfectly clear, as usual.
