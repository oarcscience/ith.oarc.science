<span id="viii.v.iv.xvii-p7"></span>The apostle Paul, in the [1 Cor.
11.10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010)<span
id="viii.v.iv.xvii-p7.1"></span>, represents the long hair of women,
which is given them as a natural veil, as a token of their subjection to
man.  We learn from the Synod of Gangra, that as many Eustathian women
renounced this subjection, and left their husbands, so, as this canon
says, they also did away with their long hair, which was the outward
token of this subjection.  An old proverb says:  *duo si faciunt idem,
non est idem*.  In the Catholic Church also, when women and girls enter
the cloister, they have their hair cut off, but from quite other reasons
than those of the Eustathian women.  The former give up their hair,
because it has gradually become the custom to consider the long hair of
women as a special beauty, as their greatest ornament; but the
Eustathians, like the ancient Church in general, regarded long hair as
the token of subjection to the husband, and, because they renounced
marriage and forsook their husbands, they cut it off.

Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. ij.
