<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-p3.1"></A>Item</span>, it seemed good that as often as the council is to be assembled, the bishops who are impeded neither by age, sickness, or other grave necessity, come together, and that notice be given to the primates of their several provinces, that from all the bishops there be made two or three squads, and of each of these squads there be elected some who shall be promptly ready on the council day:&#160; but should they not be able to attend, <A NAME="page_480"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 480</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iv.iv.lxxvii-Page_480"></A>let them write their excuses in the tractory,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">465</FONT></A>
