<span id="xiv.iii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Since</span> clerics of different
churches have left their own churches in which they were ordained and
betaken themselves to other bishops, and without the consent of their
own bishop have been settled in other churches, and thus they have
proved themselves to be insolent and disobedient; we decree that from
the month of January of the past <span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xviii-p2.2"></span>IV</span>th Indiction no cleric, of
whatsoever grade he be, shall have power, without letters dimissory of
his own bishop, to be registered in the clergy list of another church. 
Whoever in future shall not have observed this rule, but shall have
brought disgrace upon himself as well as on the bishop who ordained him,
let him be deposed together with him who also received him.
