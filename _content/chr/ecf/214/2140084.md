<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxiii-p8"></span>It is noteworthy how singularly
appositely \[Constantine\] Harmenopulus the Scholiast in the *Epitom.
Canonum*., Sect. v., tit. 3, tells the following story:  “In the time of
the Patriarch Luke, a certain bishop gave absolution in writing to a
soldier who had committed voluntary homicide, after a very short time of
penance; and afterwards when he was accused before the synod of having
done so, he defended himself by citing the canon which gives bishops the
power of remitting or increasing the length of their penance to
penitents.  But he was told in answer that this was granted indeed to
pontiffs but not that they should use it without examination, and with
too great lenity.  Wherefore the synod subjected the soldier to the
canonical penance and the bishop it mulcted for a certain time, bidding
him cease from the exercise of his ministry.”
