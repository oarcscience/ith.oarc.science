<span id="x.x-p4"></span>\[*No action is recorded in the Acts as having
been taken.  A verbal report was made by certain who had seen Nestorius
during the past three days, that they were hopeless of any repentance on
his part.  On the motion of Flavian, bishop of Philippi, a number of
passages from the Fathers were read; and after that some selections from
the writings of Nestorius.  A letter from Capreolus, Archbishop of
Carthage, was next read, excusing his absence; after the reading of the
letter, which makes no direct reference to Nestorius whatever, but prays
the Synod to see to it that no novelties be tolerated, the Acts
proceed*.  (Col. 534<span id="x.x-p4.1"></span>).\]

<span id="x.x-p5"></span>Cyril, the bishop of the Church of Alexandria,
said:  As this letter of the most reverend and pious Capreolus, bishop
of Carthage, which has been read, contains a most lucid expression of
opinion, let it be inserted in the Acts.  For it wishes that the ancient
dogmas of the faith should be confirmed, and that novelties, absurdly
conceived and impiously brought forth, should be reprobated and
proscribed.

<span id="x.x-p6"></span>All the bishops at the same time cried out: 
These are the sentiments (<span class="Greek"><span
id="x.x-p6.1"></span>φωναί</span>) of all of us, these are the things we
all say—the accomplishment of this is the desire of us all.

<span id="x.x-p7"></span>\[*Immediately follows the sentence of
deposition and the subscriptions.  It seems almost certain that
something has dropped out here, most probably the whole discussion of
Cyril’s XII. Anathematisms*.\]
