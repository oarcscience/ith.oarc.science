<span id="viii.vii.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>They</span> who have sinned in divers
particulars, if they have persevered in the prayer of confession and
penance, and are wholly converted from their faults, shall be received
again to communion, through the mercy and goodness of God, after a time
of penance appointed to them, in proportion to the nature of their
offence.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.iii-p5"></span>Those who have fallen unto various
faults and have confessed them with compunction, and done the penance
suitable to them, shall be favourably received.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.iii-p7"></span>Van Espen and others were of
opinion that this canon treated only of those who had themselves been
guilty of various criminal acts, and it has been asked whether any one
guilty not only of one gross sin, but of several of various kinds, might
also be again received into communion.  It seems to me, however, that
this canon with the words, “those who have sinned in divers
particulars,” simply means that “sinners of various kinds shall be
treated exactly in proportion to the extent of their fall.”  That the
question is not necessarily of different sins committed by the same
person appears from the words, “in proportion to the nature of their
offence,” as the singular, not the plural, is here used.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.iii-p8"></span>But Van Espen, with Aubespine, is
clearly right in not referring the words, “if they persevere in
confession and repentance,” to sacramental confession, to which the
expression “persevere” would not be well suited.  Here is evidently
meant the oft-repeated contrite confession before God and the
congregation in prayer of sins committed, which preceded sacramental
confession and absolution.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.iii-p9"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa XXVI., Quæst.
vii., can. iv.
