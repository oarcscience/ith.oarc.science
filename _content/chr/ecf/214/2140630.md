<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-Page_495"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p1.1"></span>Canon CVI.  (Greek cix.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p2"></span>*That those who are going to carry
their case to court should be careful to inform either the bishop of
Carthage or* <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477) *the bishop of
Rome.*

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p4.1"></span>It</span> seemed good that whoever wished
to go to court, should give notice in the form which is sent to the
Church of the city of Rome, that from thence also he should receive a
formed letter to court.  But if receiving only a formed letter to Rome,
and saying nothing about the necessity which he had of going to court,
he willed immediately to go thither, let him be cut off from communion. 
But if while at Rome the necessity of going to court suddenly arose, let
him state his necessity to the bishop of Rome and let him carry with him
a rescript of the same Roman bishop.  But let the formed letters which
are issued by primates and by certain bishops to their own clergy have
the date of Easter; but if it be yet uncertain what is the date of
Easter of that year, let the preceding Easter’s date be set down, as it
is customary to date public acts after the consulship.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p5"></span>It further seemed good that those who
were sent as delegates from this glorious council should ask of the most
glorious princes whatever they saw would be useful against the Donatists
and Pagans, and their superstitions.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p6"></span>It also seemed good to all the
bishops that all conciliar letters be signed by your holiness alone. 
And they subscribed:  I, Aurelius, Bishop of Carthage, have consented to
this decree, and having read it, now subscribe my name.  Likewise also
the rest of the bishops subscribed.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon CVI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p8"></span>Whoever from any necessity was going
to court, must declare his intention to the bishop of Carthage and to
the bishop of Rome, and receive a letter dimissory, and otherwise he
shall be excommunicated.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p9"></span>Whatever shall seem to the legates
useful against the Donatists and Greeks, and their superstitions, that
shall be sought from the Emperor.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p10"></span>(Greek cx.)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p11"></span>Synod against the pagans and
heretics.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p12"></span>In the consulship of those most
illustrious men Bassus and Philip, the xvith Calends of July, at
Carthage, in the secretarium of the restored basilica.\* <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478)   In this council the bishop
Fortunatian received a second appointment as legate against the pagans
and heretics.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p14"></span>Item, a council against the pagans
and heretics.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cvii-p15"></span>In the consulship of those most
illustrious men Bassus and Philip, the iii. Ides of October at Carthage,
in the Secretarium of the restored basilica\*.  In this council the
bishops Restitutus and Florentius received a legation against the pagans
and heretics, at the time Severus and Macarius were slain, and on their
account the bishops Euodius, Theasius and Victor were put to death.
