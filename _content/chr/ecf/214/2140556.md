<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXXII.  (Greek xxxv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span>*If any poor cleric, no matter what
his rank may be, shall acquire any property, it shall be subject to the
power of the bishop.* <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxiii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxxiii-p4.1"></span>It</span> also seemed good that
bishops, presbyters, deacons and any other of the clergy, who when they
were ordained had no possessions, and in the time of their episcopate or
after they became clerics, shall purchase in their own names lands or
any other property, shall be held guilty of the crime of intrenching
upon the Lord’s goods, unless, when they are admonished to do so, they
place the same at the disposal of the Church.  But should anything come
to them personally by the liberality of anyone, or by succession from
some relative, let them do what they will with it; if, however, they
demand it back again, contrary to what they proposed, they shall be
judged unworthy of ecclesiastical honour as back-sliders.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxiii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxxiii-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXXII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxiii-p7"></span>Whoso after his ordination although
he has nothing yet buys a field, shall give it to the Church, unless he
got it by succession from a relation or by pure liberality.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxiii-p8"></span>In this canon there is difficulty
about the meaning of the phrase “quod eorum proposito congruat.” 
Hardouin suggests that “propositum” is the same as “profession,” or
“calling,” and the meaning, were this the case, would be that he must
employ it as befits his clerical calling.  Van Espen follows Balsamon
and Zonaras in understanding it to mean that if he has proposed to
employ a part for the Church or for the poor, and changes his mind, he
is to be deposed; and this meaning I have followed.
