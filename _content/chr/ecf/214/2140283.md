<span id="x.xvi.i-p4"></span>The holy and ecumenical Synod, gathered
together in Ephesus by the decree of our most religious Emperors, to the
bishops, presbyters, deacons, and all the people in every province and
city:

<span id="x.xvi.i-p5"></span>When we had assembled, according to the
religious decree \[of the Emperors\], in the Metropolis of Ephesus,
certain persons, a little more than thirty in number, withdrew from
amongst us, having for the leader of their schism John, Bishop of
Antioch.  Their names are as follows:  first, the said John of Antioch
in Syria, John of Damascus, Alexander of Apamea, Alexander of
Hierapolis, Himerius of Nicomedia, Fritilas of Heraclea, Helladius of
Tarsus, Maximin of Anazarbus, Theodore of Marcianopolis, Peter of
Trajanopolis, Paul of Emissa, Polychronius of Heracleopolis, Euthyrius
of Tyana, Meletius of Neocæsarea, Theodoret of Cyrus, Apringius of
Chalcedon, Macarius of Laodicea Magna, Zosys of Esbus, Sallust of
Corycus in Cilicia, Hesychius of Castabala in Cilicia, Valentine of
Mutloblaca, Eustathius of Parnassus, Philip of Theodosia, and Daniel,
and Dexianus, and Julian, and Cyril, and Olympius, and Diogenes, Polius,
Theophanes of Philadelphia, Trajan of Augusta, Aurelius of Irenopolis,
Mysæus of Aradus, Helladius of Ptolemais.  These men, having no
privilege of ecclesiastical communion on the ground of a priestly
authority, by which they could injure or benefit any persons; since some
of them had already been deposed; and since from their refusing to join
in our decree against Nestorius, it was manifestly evident to all men
that they were all promoting the opinions of Nestorius and Celestius;
the Holy Synod, by one common decree, deposed them from all
ecclesiastical communion, and deprived them of all their priestly power
by which they might injure or profit any persons.
