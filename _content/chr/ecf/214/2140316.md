id="xi.xvi-p1.1"></span>The Decree with Regard to the Bishop of
Ephesus.</span>

<span id="xi.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xvi-p2.1"></span>Session XII.</span>

<span id="xi.xvi-p3"></span>(Labbe and Cossart, *Concilia*, Tom. IV.,
col. 706.)

<span id="xi.xvi-p4"></span>The most glorious judges said:  Since the
proposition of the God-beloved archbishop of royal Constantinople,
Anatolius, and of the most reverend bishop Paschasinus, holding the
place of Leo, the most God-beloved archbishop of old Rome, which orders
that because both of them \[i.e., Bassianus and Stephen\] acted
uncanonically, neither of them should rule, nor be called bishop of the
most holy church of Ephesus, and since the whole holy synod taught that
uncanonically they had performed these ordinations, and had agreed with
the speeches of the most reverend bishops; the most reverend Bassianus
and the most reverend Stephen will be removed from the holy church of
Ephesus; but they shall enjoy the episcopal dignity, and from the
revenues of the before-mentioned most holy church, for their nourishment
and consolation, they shall receive each year two hundred gold pieces;
and another bishop shall be ordained according to the canons for the
most holy church. <span id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287)

<span id="xi.xvi-p6"></span>And the whole holy synod cried out:  This is
a just sentence.  This is a pious scheme.  These things are fair to look
upon.

<span id="xi.xvi-p7"></span>The most reverend bishop Bassianus said: 
Pray give order that what was stolen from me be restored.

<span id="xi.xvi-p8"></span>The most glorious judges said:  If anything
belonging to the most reverend bishop Bassianus personally has been
taken from him, either by the most reverend bishop Stephen, or by any
other persons whatsoever, this shall be restored, after judicial proof,
by them who took it away or caused it to be taken.

<span id="xi.xvi-p5"></span> The English translation of Hefele asserts
twice (*Hist. of the Councils,* Vol. III., pp. 173 and 376), that
Bassianus was “deposed.”  This is entirely a mistake, he was deprived of
his diocese, but retained his episcopal rank.
