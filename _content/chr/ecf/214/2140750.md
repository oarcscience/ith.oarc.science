id="xvii.xxx-p4.1"></span>Cyril to Domnus.</span>

<span id="xvii.xxx-p5"></span>This letter contains a complaint of one,
Peter, deposed from his See, yet retaining the character of a bishop,
who thought his cause good, but complains that he had not time and
opportunity given him for his defence; and that whatever he had, was
taken away from him.  He desires Domnus, who was a Metropolitan, that he
would call a synod, and let him have a hearing; and that such bishops as
Peter suspected of prejudice against him should not be permitted to be
his judges.  He thinks it very hard, that not only what belonged to the
Church, but every thing else was taken from him; and complains that all
bishops were called to account for every thing they received, whether
from the Church, or by any other means.  Peter had indeed signed an
instrument of resignation; but Cyril says, that he was terrified into
it; and that he would have no such resignation be of force except he
that made it deserved deposition.
