<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iv.iii.viii-p7"></A>Although the Eastern Church allows the clergy to have wives, even priests, and permits to them the use of marriage after ordination, nevertheless it requires of them the highest conjugal continency, as is seen by the present canon.&#160; For here it is evident that the Fathers wished even the smallest possible kind of incontinence to be absent from men dedicated to holiness.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iv.iii.viii-p8"></A>This canon is found in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratian&#146;s <i>Decretum</i>, Pars I., Dist. xxxiv., c. xi.</p>
