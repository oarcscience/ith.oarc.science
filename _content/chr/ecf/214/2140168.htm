<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.ii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.vii.iii.ii-p2.1"></A>It</span> is right, according to the ecclesiastical Canon, that the Communion should by indulgence be given to those who have freely and lawfully joined in second marriages, not having previously made a secret marriage; after a short space, which is to be spent by them in prayer and fasting.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="viii.vii.iii.ii-p5"></A>A digamist not secretly married, after devoting himself for a short time to praying shall be held blameless afterwards.</p> 
<p class="c36"><a name="viii.vii.iii.ii-p6"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.vii.iii.ii-p6.1"></A>Van Espen.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.ii-p7"></A>Many synods imposed a penance upon digamists, although the Church never condemned second marriages.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.ii-p8"></A>On this whole subject of second marriages see notes on Canon VIII. of Nice, on Canons III. and VII. of Neoc&aelig;sarea, and on Canon XIX. of Ancyra.&#160; In treating of this canon Hefele does little but follow Van Espen, who accepts Bishop Beveridge&#146;s conclusions in opposition to Justellus and refers to him, as follows, &#8220;See this observation of Justellus&#146; refuted more at length by William Beveridge in his notes on this canon,&#8221; and Bp. Beveridge adopted and defended the exposition of the Greek commentators, viz.:&#160; there is some fault and some punishment, they are to be held back from communion for &#8220;a short space,&#8221; but after that, it is according to the law of the Church that they should be admitted to communion.&#160; The phrase &#8220;not having previously made a secret marriage&#8221; means that there must not have been intercourse with the woman before the second marriage was &#8220;lawfully&#8221; contracted, for if so the punishment would have been for fornication, and neither light nor for &#8220;a short space.&#8221;&#160; The person referred to in the canon is a real digamist and not a bigamist, this is proved by the word &#8220;lawfully&#8221; which could not be used of the second marriage of a man who already had a living wife.</p>
