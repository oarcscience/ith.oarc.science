<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xxvii-p4"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xxvii-p4.1"></A>Likewise</span> it seemed good that no one should sell anything belonging to the Church:&#160; that if there was no revenue, and other great necessity urged thereto, this might be brought before the Metropolitan of the province that he might deliberate with the appointed number of bishops whether this should be done:&#160; that if such urgent necessity lay upon any church that it could not take counsel beforehand, at least let it call together the neighbouring bishops as witnesses, taking care to refer all the necessities of his church to the council:&#160; and that if he shall not do this, he shall be held as responsible toward God, and as a seller in the eye of the council, and he shall have lost thereby his honour.</p>
