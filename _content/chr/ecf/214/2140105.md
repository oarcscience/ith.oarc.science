<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.xiv-p2.1"></span>The</span> chorepiscopi, however, are
indeed after the pattern of the Seventy; and as fellow-servants, on
account of their devotion to the poor, they have the honour of making
the oblation.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiv-p5"></span>\[Vide ante, as in many <span

canons are united in the Ancient Epitome.\]

id="viii.iv.iii.xiv-p6.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiv-p7"></span>The reference to the Seventy seems
to intimate that the Synod did not hold the chorepiscopi to be true
bishops, as such were always reputed and called successors, not of the
Seventy disciples but successors of the Twelve Apostles.  It is also
clear that their chief ministry was thought to be the care of the poor.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.xiv-p8"></span>Zonaras and Balsamon would seem to
agree in this with Van Espen.  See on the whole subject the Excursus on
the Chorepiscopi.
