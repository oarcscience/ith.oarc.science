<p class="c50"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxvi-p2"></A>Concerning the condemned bishop Equitius.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxvi-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxvi-p3.1"></A>Aurelius</span>, the bishop, said:&#160; I do not think that the case of Equitius should be passed over in the legation, who some time ago for his crimes was condemned by an Episcopal sentence; that if by any chance our legate should meet him in those parts, our brother should take care for the state of the Church, as opportunity offered or where he could, to <A NAME="page_475"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 475</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iv.iv.lxvi-Page_475"></A>act against him.&#160; And all the bishops said:&#160; This prosecution is exceedingly agreeable to us, especially as Equitius was condemned some time ago, his impudent unrest ought to be repelled everywhere more and more for the good estate and health of the Church.&#160; And they subscribed, I, Aurelius, the bishop of the Church of Carthage, have consented to this decree, and after having read it have signed my name.&#160; Likewise also signed all the other bishops.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxvi-p6"></A>Equitius, who had been condemned by the judgment of the bishops, and had behaved impudently against the ecclesiastical authority, ought to be opposed.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxvi-p7"></A>This is Canon ix. of the Synod of Carthage, June 15 (or 16), <span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxvi-p7.1"></A>a.d.</span> 401.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxvi-p10"></A>In this council the letters of Anastasius the Roman Pontiff were read, admonishing the Catholic bishops concerning the Donatists.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.lxvi-p11"></A>In the consulship of those most illustrious men Vencentius and Flavius, on the Ides of September, at Carthage, in the secretarium of the restored basilica.&#160; When we had been gathered together in council in the church at Carthage and had taken our seats, bishops from all the African Provinces, that is to say, Aurelius, the bishop of that see with his colleagues (just who they were is made evident by their signatures) [the same bishop Aurelius said]:&#160; When the letters of our most blessed brother and fellow priest, Anastasius, bishop of the Church of Rome, had been read, in which he exhorted us out of the solicitude and sincerity of his paternal and brotherly love, that we should in no way dissimulate with regard to the wiles and wickednesses of the Donatist heretics and schismatics, by which they gravely vex the Catholic Church of Africa, we thank our Lord that he hath vouchsafed to inspire that best and holy archbishop with such a pious care for the members of Christ, although in divers lands, yet builded together into the one body of Christ.</p>
