<p class="c18"><a name="x.ix.xiii-p6"></A>If any one maintains that the flesh which is united with God the Word is by the power of its own nature life-giving, whereas the Lord himself says, &#8220;It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#061">John 6.61</a><a name="x.ix.xiii-p6.1"></A>), let him be anathema.&#160; [He adds, &#8220;God is a Spirit&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024">John 4.24</a><a name="x.ix.xiii-p6.2"></A>).&#160; If, then, any one maintains that God the Logos has in a carnal manner, in his substance, become flesh, and persists in this with reference to the Lord Christ; who himself after his resurrection said to his disciples, &#8220;Handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having&#8221; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039">Luke 24.39</a><a name="x.ix.xiii-p6.3"></A>); let him be anathema.]</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="x.ix.xiii-p8"></A>The part enclosed in brackets is certainly a spurious addition and is wanting in many manuscripts.&#160; <i>Cf</i>. Marius Mercator [ed. Migne], p. 919.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="x.ix.xiii-p10"></A>(<i>Declaratio undecima</i>.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="x.ix.xiii-p11"></A>We perform in the churches the holy, lifegiving, and unbloody sacrifice; the body, as also the precious blood, which is exhibited we believe not to be that of a common man and of any one like unto us, but receiving it rather as his own body and as the blood of the Word which gives all things life.&#160; For common flesh cannot give life.&#160; And this our Saviour himself testified when he said:&#160; &#8220;The flesh profiteth nothing, it is the Spirit that giveth life.&#8221;&#160; For since the flesh became the very own of the Word, therefore we understand that it is lifegiving, as the Saviour himself said:&#160; &#8220;As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me shall live by me.&#8221;&#160; Since therefore Nestorius and those who think with him rashly dissolve the power of this mystery; therefore it was convenient that this anathematism should be put forth.</p>
