<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXXI.  (Greek xxxiv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxii-p2"></span>If certain clerics advanced by their
own bishops are supercilious, let them not remain whence they are
unwilling to come forth.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxxii-p3.1"></span>It</span> also seemed good that whoever
of the clergy or of the deacons would not help the bishop in the
necessities of the churches, when he wished to lift them to a higher
position in his diocese, should no longer be allowed to exercise the
functions of that grade from which they were not willing to be removed.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxii-p6"></span>Who despises a greater honour shall
lose what he hath.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxxii-p8"></span>It is most probable that this canon
is to be understood of deacons designed by the bishop to be ordained
priests, for the deacons, at least in some Churches, were provided of a
better maintenance than priests; or it may be understood of inferior
clergymen, who were permitted to marry in the degree they were now in,
but would not willingly take the order of priest or deacon, because then
they were prohibited marriage.
