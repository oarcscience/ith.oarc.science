<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.lix-p7"></A>It is well known that in the first centuries it was customary that the Holy Eucharist should be taken back by the faithful to their houses; and that at home they received it at their own hands.&#160; It is evident that this was what was done by the Anchorites and monks who lived in the deserts, as may be seen proved by Cardinal Bona.&#160; (<i>De Rebus Liturg</i>., Lib. II., cap. xvij.).&#160; From this domestic communion it is easily seen how the abuse arose which is condemned in this canon.</p>
