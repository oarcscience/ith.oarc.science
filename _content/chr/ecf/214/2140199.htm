<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p7"></A>Eusebius (<i>H. E.</i>, Lib. IX., Cap. X.) employs the expression <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p7.1"></A>&#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#8049;</span> in the same sense as does this canon as identical with churches.&#160; The prohibition itself, however, here given, as well as the preceding canon, proves that as early as the time of the Synod of Laodicea, many irregularities had crept into the <i>agape</i>.&#160; For the rest, this Synod was not in a position permanently to banish the usage from the Church; for which reason the Trullan Synod in its seventy-fourth canon repeated this rule word for word.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxiii-p8"></A>This canon is found in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratian&#146;s <i>Decretum</i>, Pars I., Disk XLII., c. iv.</p>
