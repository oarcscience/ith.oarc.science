<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.v-p12"></A>Mere there is properly speaking no provision for &#8220;appeal,&#8221; which entirely suspends [i.e. by the canon law] the execution and effect of the first sentence; but rather for a revision of judgment.&#8230;; those who were sent by the Roman bishop from his side (<i>a latere</i>) or the bishops who were appointed, ought, together with the bishops of the province who had given the former sentence, to give a fresh judgment and declare their sentence.&#160; And this Hincmar of Rheims was the first to notice in his letters in the name of Charles the Bald sent to John VIII.</p>
