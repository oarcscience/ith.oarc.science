<span id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>If</span> a woman shall have married two
brothers, let her be cast out \[i.e. of communion\] until her death. 
Nevertheless, at the hour of death she may, as an act of mercy, be
received to penance, provided she declare that she will break the
marriage, should she recover.  But if the woman in such a marriage, or
the man, die, penance for the survivor shall be very difficult.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon II.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p5"></span>A woman married to two brothers
shall be expelled all her life.  But if when near her death she promises
that she will loose the marriage should she recover, she shall be
admitted to penance.  But if one of those coupled together die, only
with great difficulty shall penitence be allowed to the one still
living.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p6"></span>It will be carefully observed that
this canon has no provision for the case of a man marrying two sisters. 
It is the prohibited degree <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> <span
id="viii.iv.iii.ii-Page_80"></span>of brother’s wife, not that of wife’s
sister which is in consideration.  Of course those who hold that the
affinity is the same in each case will argue from this canon by parity
of reasoning, and those who do not accept that position will refuse to
do so.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p7"></span>In the Greek text of Balsamon
(*Vide* Beveridge, *Synod*.) after the first clause is added, “if she
will not be persuaded to loose the marriage.”

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p8.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p9"></span>The meaning of this canon seems to
be that which Balsamon sets forth, to wit, that if a woman at the point
of death or *in extremis* promises that if she gets better she will
dissolve the marriage, or make a divorce, or abstain from the
sacrilegious use of matrimony, then “she may be received to penance as
an act of mercy”; and surely she is immediately absolved from the
excommunication inflicted upon her when she was cast out and extruded
from the Church.  For it is certain that according to the discipline of
the Fathers he was thought to be loosed from excommunication whoever was
admitted to penance, and it is of this that the canon speaks; <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122) but he did not obtain perfect
reconciliation until his penance was done.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.ii-p11"></span>To this performance of penance this
woman was to be admitted if she got well and dissolved the marriage
according to her promise made when she was in peril of death, as the
Greek commentators note; and this too is the sense given by Isidore.
