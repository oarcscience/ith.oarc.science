<p class="c18"><a name="xi.viii-p4"></A>After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend bishops cried out:&#160; This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles.&#160; So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe.&#160; Anathema to him who does not thus believe.&#160; Peter has spoken thus through Leo.&#160; So taught the Apostles.&#160; Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril.&#160; Everlasting be the memory of Cyril.&#160; Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe.&#160; This is the true faith.&#160; Those of us who are orthodox thus believe.&#160; This is the faith of the fathers.&#160; Why were not these things read at Ephesus [i.e. at the heretical synod held there]?&#160; These are the things Dioscorus hid away.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xi.viii-p5"></A>[<i>Some explanations were asked by the Illyrian bishops and the answers were found satisfactory, but yet a delay of a few days was asked for, and some bishops petitioned for a general pardon of all who had been kept out.&#160; This proposition made great confusion, in the midst of which the session was dissolved by the judges</i>.&#160; (Col. 371<a name="xi.viii-p5.1"></A>.)]</p>
