<p class="c18"><a name="xvi.ix-p4"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xvi.ix-p4.1"></A>Leo</span> the most renowned secretary said:&#160; The holy and blessed Synod know how at the last session we examined divers sayings of the God-forsaken heretics, who had brought charges against the holy and spotless Church of the Christians for the setting up of the holy images.&#160; But to-day we have in our hands the written blasphemy of those calumniators of the Christians, that is to say, the absurd, and easily answered, and self-convicting definition (<span class="Greek"><a name="xvi.ix-p4.2"></A>&#8005;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>) of the pseudosyllogus, in all respects agreeing with the impious opinion of the God-hated heretics.&#160; But not only have we this, but also the artful and most drastic refutation thereof, which the Holy Spirit had supervised.&#160; For it was right that this definition should be made a triumph by wise contradictions, and should be torn to pieces with strong refutations.&#160; This also we submit so as to know your pleasure with regard to it.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xvi.ix-p5"></A>The holy Synod said:&#160; Let it be read.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xvi.ix-p6"></A>John, the deacon and chancellor [of the most holy great Church of Constantinople, <i>in Lat. only</i>] read.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvi.ix-p7"></A>[<i>John, the deacon, then read the orthodox refutation, and Gregory, the bishop of Neoc&aelig;sarea, the Definition of the Mock Council, the one reading the heretical statement and the other the orthodox answer</i>.]</p>
