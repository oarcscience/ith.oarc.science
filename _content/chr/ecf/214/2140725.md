<span id="xvii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.v-p1.1"></span>I.</span>

<span id="xvii.v-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.v-p2.1"></span>The Letter of the Blessed Dionysius, the
Archbishop of Alexandria to Basilides the Bishop who made Enquiries on
Various Subjects, to which Dionysius made Answer in this Epistle, which
Answers have been received as Canons. <span
id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581) </span>

<span id="xvii.v-p4"></span>Dionysius to my beloved son, and brother,
and fellow minister in holy things, Basilides faithful to God,
salutation in the Lord.

<span id="xvii.v-p5"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.v-p5.1"></span>Note.</span>

<span id="xvii.v-p6"></span>Dionysius, Johnson says, wrote in about
<span class="sc"><span id="xvii.v-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 247.

<span id="xvii.v-p7"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.v-p7.1"></span>Canon I. <span id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582)
</span>

<span id="xvii.v-p9"></span>When the Paschal fast is to be broken
depends on the precise hour of our Saviour’s resurrection, and this was
not certainly to be known from the Four Evangelists; therefore they who
have not fasted the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday before
Easter, do no great thing if they fast the Friday and Saturday, and so
till past three on Easter morning.  But they who have fasted the whole
six days, are not to be blamed if they break their fast after midnight. 
Some do not fast any of these days.

<span id="xvii.v-p10"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.v-p10.1"></span>Canon II.</span>

<span id="xvii.v-p11"></span>Menstruous women ought not to come to the
Holy Table, or touch the Holy of Holies, <span
id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583) nor to the churches, but pray
elsewhere.

<span id="xvii.v-p13"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.v-p13.1"></span>Note.</span>

<span id="xvii.v-p14"></span>Balsamon notes how the canon educes the
example of the woman who had had an issue of blood for twelve years and
who therefore did not dare to touch the Lord, but only the “hem of his
garment.”  He also notes that the question proposed, was whether
Christian women should be excluded from the church and need follow the
example of the Hebrews, who “when the menstrual flux was upon them, sat
in a solitary place by themselves and waited for seven days to pass, and
their flux should be over.”  The answer given is as above.

<span id="xvii.v-p15"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.v-p15.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="xvii.v-p16"></span>They that can contain and are aged ought to
judge for themselves.  They have heard St. Paul say; that they should
“for a time give themselves to prayer, and then come together again.”

<span id="xvii.v-p17"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.v-p17.1"></span>Note.</span>

<span id="xvii.v-p18"></span>In this epitome Johnson has set forth the
meaning of the canon, as understood by the Greek scholiasts, rather than
translated and epitomized the canon itself.

<span id="xvii.v-p19"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.v-p19.1"></span>Canon IV.</span>

<span id="xvii.v-p20"></span>They who have had involuntary nocturnal
pollutions be at their own discretion \[whether to communicate or not\].

<span id="xvii.v-p21"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xvii.v-p21.1"></span>Note.</span>

<span id="xvii.v-p22"></span>The Saint ends this canon with these
words:  “I have given opinion on the points about which you have
consulted me, not as a doctor, but in all simplicity as it is suitable
the relation between us should be.  And when you have examined, my most
learned son, what I have written you will let me know what seems to you
better or whether you agree with my opinions.  Farewell, dear son, may
your ministry be in the peace of the Lord.”
