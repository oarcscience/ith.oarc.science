<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p2.1"></A>It</span> is not right for a deacon to sit in the presence of a presbyter, unless he be bidden by the presbyter to sit down.&#160; Likewise the deacons shall have worship of the subdeacons and all the [inferior] clergy.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p5"></A>A deacon shall not sit down unless bidden.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p6"></A>This is another canon to curb the ambition of Levites who wish to take upon themselves the honours of the priesthood also.&#160; Spiritual Cores seem to have been common in early times among the deacons and this is but one of many canons on the subject.&#160; Compare Canon XVIII of the Council of Nice.&#160; Van Espen points out that in the Apostolic Constitutions (Lib. II., cap. lvij), occurs the following passage, &#8220;Let the seat for the bishop be set in the midst, and on each side of him let the presbyters sit, and let the deacons stand, having their loins girded.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p8"></A>Here it should be noted, by the way, that in this canon there is presented a hierarchy consisting of bishops, presbyters, and deacons and other inferior ministers, each with their mutual subordination one to the other.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxiii-p9"></A>This canon is found in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratian&#146;s <i>Decretum</i>, Pars I., Dist. xciii., c. xv., in Dionysius&#146;s version.</p>
