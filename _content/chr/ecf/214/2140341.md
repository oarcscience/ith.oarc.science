<span id="xi.xviii.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXIII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>It</span> has come to the hearing of the
holy Synod that certain clergymen and monks, having no authority from
their own bishop, and sometimes, indeed, while under sentence of
excommunication by him, betake themselves to the imperial
Constantinople, and remain there for a long time, raising disturbances
and troubling the ecclesiastical state, <span id="page_284">p.
284</span> <span id="xi.xviii.xxiii-Page_284"></span>and turning men’s
houses upside down.  Therefore the holy Synod has determined that such
persons be first notified by the Advocate of the most holy Church of
Constantinople to depart from the imperial city; and if they shall
shamelessly continue in the same practices, that they shall be expelled
by the same Advocate even against their will, and return to their own
places.
