id="viii.iv.iii.v-p2.1"></span>If</span> a catechumen coming into the
Church have taken his place in the order of catechumens, and fall into
sin, let him, if a kneeler, become a hearer and sin no more.  But should
he again sin while a hearer, let him be cast out.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.v-p5"></span>If a catechumen falls into a fault
and if while a kneeler he sins no more, let him be among the hearers;
but should he sin while among the hearers, let him be cast out
altogether.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.v-p7"></span>There are two sorts of catechumens. 
For some have only just come in and these, as still imperfect, go out
immediately after the reading of the scriptures and of the Gospels.  But
there are others who have been for some time in preparation and have
attained some perfection; these wait after the Gospel for the prayers
for the catechumens, and when they hear the words “Catechumens, bow down
your heads to the Lord,” they kneel down.  These, as being more perfect,
having tasted the good words of God, if they fall, are removed from
their position; and are placed with the “hearers”; but if any happen to
sin while “hearers” they are cast out of the Church altogether.
