<span id="viii.vii.iii.iv-p5"></span>A neophite is not ordainable.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.iv-p6"></span>This rule is laid down in the

<span id="viii.vii.iii.iv-p8"></span>Notwithstanding this provision,
that great light, Nectarius, just separated from the flock of the
catechumens, when he had washed away the sins of his life in the divine
font, now pure himself, he put on the most pure dignity of the
episcopate, and at the same time became bishop of the Imperial City, and
president of the Second Holy Ecumenical Synod.
