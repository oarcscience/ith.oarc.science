id="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p1.1"></span>Canon XCIV.  (Greek xcvii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p2"></span>Summary of Chapters.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p3.1"></span>That</span> a free delegation be sent to
the council from all the provinces to Mizoneum.  Legates <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474) and letters were ordered to be sent
for the purpose of directing the free legation:  that became the unity
had been made only at Carthage, letters should also be given to the
judges, that they might order in the other provinces and cities the work
of union to be proceeded with, and the thanksgivings of the Church of
Carthage for the whole of Africa concerning the exclusion of the
Donatists should be sent with the letters of the bishops to Court (*ad
Comitatum*).

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p5"></span>The letters of Pope Innocent were
read:  that bishops ought not readily to carry causes across seas, and
this very thing was confirmed by the judgment of the bishops themselves;
that on account of thanksgiving and the exclusion of the Donatists, two
clerics of the Church of Carthage should be sent to Court.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p8"></span>*It seemed good that letters be sent
to the Magistrates that the Donatists be expelled.* <span
id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p10"></span>This introduction is taken from the
Synod of Carthage of August 23, 405.  There is also added the
introduction of the Synod of Carthage of June 13, 407.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p11"></span>In this synod certain things already
decreed are corrected.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p12"></span>Under the most illustrious emperors
Honorius for the <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p12.1"></span>VII</span>th time, and Theodosius for the
second time, the consuls being the Augusti, on the Ides of July in
Carthage in the basilica of the second region, when bishop Aurelius
together with his other bishops had taken his seat, and while the
deacons stood by, he said:  Since it was decreed in the council of
Hippo, that each year there should assemble a plenary council of Africa,
not only here in Carthage but also in the different provinces in their
order, and this was reserved that we should determine its place of
meeting sometimes in Numidia and sometimes in Byzacium.  But this seemed
laborious to all the brethren.
