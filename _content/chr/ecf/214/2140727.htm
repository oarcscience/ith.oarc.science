<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.vii-p5"></A>That they who have been taken captives by the barbarians, and have eaten with them, be not treated as persons that have eaten things offered to idols; especially because it is universally reported, that they do not sacrifice to idols; nor shall those women who have been ravished by them, be treated as guilty of fornication, unless they were before of lewd lives.</p>

 expects that such should be thunder-struck, and therefore desires that some enquiry be made upon the spot by persons sent for this purpose.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.vii-p16"></A>That they who joined the barbarians in their murder and ravages, or were guides or informers to them, be not permitted to be hearers, till holy men assembled together do agree in common upon what shall seem good, first to the Holy Ghost, then to themselves.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xvii.vii-p3"></A> Johnson says this was about the year of grace 240, after the Goths had ravaged Asia, during the reign of Galienus.&#160; The letter, he thinks, was an Encyclical sent to every bishop of his province, by Euphrosynus, who was one of these bishops and whom he calls his &#8220;old friend.&#8221;&#160; In the beginning of the letter he addresses each one of the bishops as &#8220;most holy pope.&#8221;</p>
