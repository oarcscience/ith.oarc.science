<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xvi-p3"></A>A letter to Gregory, an unmarried priest, charging him to dismiss a woman whom he kept, though he was 70 years of age, and declared himself free from all amorous affections; and St. Basil would seem to believe him in this particular; but cites the III. canon of Nice against this practice, bids him avoid scandal, place the woman in a monastery, and be attended by men:&#160; he threatens him that if he does not comply, he shall die suspended from his office, and give account to God:&#160; that he shall be an anathema to all the people, and they who receive him [to communion] be excommunicated.</p>
