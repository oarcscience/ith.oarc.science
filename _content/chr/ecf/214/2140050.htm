<p class="c19"><a name="vii.vii-p146"></A>[<i>Note</i>.&#8212;The reader will notice that by this canon a husband is deposed or excommunicated, as the case may be, if he marry another woman, after putting away his wife on account of her adultery.&#160; It is curious that in the parallel canon in the collection of Echellensis, which is numbered LXXI., the reading is quite different, although it is very awkward and inconsequent as given.&#160; Moreover, it should be remembered that in some codices and editions this canon is lacking altogether, one on the right of the Pope to receive appeals taking its place.&#160; As this canon is of considerable length, I only quote the interesting parts.]</p>
