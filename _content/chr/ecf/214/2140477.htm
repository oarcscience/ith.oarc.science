<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xciv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.xciv-p2.1"></A>If</span> the wife of a man who has gone away and does not appear, cohabit with another before she is assured of the death of the first, she is an adulteress.&#160; The wives of soldiers who have married husbands who do not appear are in the same case; as are also they who on account of the wanderings of their husbands do not wait for their return.&#160; But the circumstance here has some excuse, in that the suspicion of his death becomes very great.&#160; But she who in ignorance has married a man who at the time was deserted by his wife, and then is dismissed because his first wife returns to him, has indeed committed fornication, but through ignorance; therefore she is not prevented from marrying, but it is better if she remain as she is.&#160; If a soldier shall return after a long time, and find his wife on account of his long absence has been united to another man, if he so wishes, he may receive his own wife [back again], pardon being extended in consideration of their ignorance both to her and to the man who took her home in second marriage.</p>
