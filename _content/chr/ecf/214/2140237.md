<span id="ix.v-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="ix.v-p1.1"></span>Historical Note on the Lost “Tome” of the Second
Council.</span>

<span id="ix.v-p2"></span>We know from the Synodical letter sent by the
bishops who assembled at Constantinople in <span class="sc"><span
id="ix.v-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 382 (the next year after the Second
Ecumenical Council) sent to Pope Damasus and other Western bishops, that
the Second Council set forth a “Tome,” containing a statement of the
doctrinal points at issue.  This letter will be found in full at the end
of the treatment of this council.  The Council of Chalcedon in its
address to the Emperor says:  “The bishops who at Constantinople
detected the taint of Apollinarianism, communicated to the Westerns
their decision in the matter.”  From this we may reasonably conclude,
with Tillemont, <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225) that the lost
Tome treated also of the Apollinarian heresy.  It is moreover by no
means unlikely that the Creed as it has come down to us, was the summary
at the end of the Tome, and was followed by the anathemas which now form
our Canon I.  It also is likely that the very accurate doctrinal
statements contained in the Letter of the Synod of 382 may be taken
almost, if not quite, verbatim from this Tome.  It seems perfectly
evident that at least one copy of the Tome was sent to the West but how
it got lost is a matter on which at present we are entirely in the dark.
