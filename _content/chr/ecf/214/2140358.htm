<p class="c18"><a name="xii.vii-p30"></A>(<i>Hist. Councils</i>, Vol. iv., p. 336.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xii.vii-p31"></A>Halloix, Garnier, Basnage, Walch and others suppose, and Vincenzi maintains with great zeal, that the name of Origen is a later insertion in this anathematism, because (a) Theodore Ascidas, the Origenist, was one of the most influential members of the Synod, and would certainly have prevented a condemnation of Origen; further, (b) because in this anathematism only such heretics would be named as had been condemned by one of the first four Ecumenical Synods, which was not the case with Origen; (c) because this anathematism is identical with the tenth in the <span class="Greek"><a name="xii.vii-p31.1"></A>&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8055;&#945;</span> of the Emperor, but in the latter the name of Origen is lacking; and, finally, (d) because Origen does not belong to the group of heretics to whom this anathematism refers.&#160; His errors were quite different.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xii.vii-p32"></A>All these considerations seem to me of insufficient strength, or mere conjecture, to make an alteration in the text, and arbitrarily to remove the name of Origen.&#160; As regards the objection in connection with Theodore Ascidas, it is known that the latter had already pronounced a formal anathema on Origen, and certainly he did the same this time, if the Emperor wished it or if it seemed advisable.&#160; The second and fourth objections have little weight.&#160; In regard to the third (c) it is quite possible that either the Emperor subsequently went further than in his <span class="Greek"><a name="xii.vii-p32.1"></A>&#8001;&#956;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8055;&#945;</span>, or that the bishops at the fifth Synod, of their own accord, added Origen, led on perhaps by one or another anti-Origenist of their number.&#160; What, however, chiefly determines us to the retention of the text is:&#160; (a) that the copy of the synodal Acts extant in the Roman archives, which has the highest credibility, and was probably prepared for Vigilius himself, contains the name of Origen in the eleventh anathematism; and (b) that the monks of the new Lama in Palestine, who are known to have been zealous Origenists, withdrew Church communion from the bishops of Palestine after these had subscribed the Acts of the fifth Synod.&#160; In the anathema on the Three Chapters these Origenists could find as little ground for such a rupture as their friends and former colleague Ascidas; it could only be by the synod attacking their darling Origen.&#160; (c) Finally, only on the ground that the name of Origen really stood in the eleventh anathematism, can we explain the widely-circulated ancient rumour that our Synod anathematized Origen and the Origenists.</p>
