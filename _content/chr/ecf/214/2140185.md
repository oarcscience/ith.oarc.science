<span id="viii.vii.iii.xix-p7"></span>Some feasts ended at the ninth
hour, others only in the evening, and both alike with prayer.  The Synod
here wills that in both cases the same prayers should be used.  Thus
does Van Espen explain the words of the text, and I think rightly.  But
the Greek commentator understands the Synod to order that the same
prayers should be used in all places, thus excluding all individual
caprice.  According to this, the rule of conformity would refer to
places; while, according to Van Espen, the nones and vespers were to be
the same.  If, however, this interpretation were correct, the Synod
would not have only spoken of the prayers at nones and vespers, but
would have said in general, “all dioceses shall use the same form of
prayer.”
