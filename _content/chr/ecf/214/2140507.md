id="xv.iii.iv.xiii-p3.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xiii-p3.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  Be this also the
pleasure of all.  If any deacon or presbyter or any of the clergy be
excommunicated and take refuge with another bishop who knows him and who
is aware that he has been removed from communion by his own bishop,
\[that other bishop\] must not offend against his brother bishop by
admitting him to communion. <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395)  
And if any dare to do this, let him know that he must present himself
before an assembly of bishops and give account.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xiii-p5"></span>All the bishops said:  This decision
will assure peace at all times and preserve the concord of all.

refused communion by his own bishop and go to another bishop, and he
with whom he has taken refuge shall know that he has been repelled by
his own bishop, then must he not grant him communion.  But if he shall
do so, let him know that he must give account before an assembly of
bishops.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xiii-p8"></span>All said:  This decision will
preserve peace and maintain concord.

id="xv.iii.iv.xiii-p10.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xiii-p11"></span>Whoso knowingly admits to communion
one excommunicated by his own bishop is not without blame.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xiii-p12"></span>This is Canon XVI. of the Latin.

id="xv.iii.iv.xiii-p13.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xiii-p14"></span>The present canon agrees with Canon
V. of Nice and with Canon IV. of Antioch, on which canons see the
notes.  The Synod’s approbation of this canon is found in Dionysius,
Isidore, and in the Roman Codex *apud* Hervetus; but it is lacking from
Balsamon and Zonaras.
