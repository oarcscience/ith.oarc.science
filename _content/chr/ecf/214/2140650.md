id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvii-p1.1"></span>Canon CXXVI.  (Greek cxxvii.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvii-p2"></span>That Virgins, even when minors,
should be given the veil.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvii-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good that
whatever bishop, by the necessity of the dangers of virginal purity,
when either a powerful suitor or some ravisher is feared, or if she
shall be pricked with some scruple of death that she might die unveiled,
at the demand either of her parents or of those to whose care she has
been entrusted, shall give the veil to a virgin, or shall have given it
while she was under twenty-five years of age, the council which has
appointed that number of years shall not oppose him.

id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXVI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvii-p6"></span>Whosoever has veiled or shall veil
a virgin before she is twenty-five years of age (that is give her the
habit, or clothe her), being forced thereto on account of a powerful
lover, or a ravisher, or deadly disease, provided those who have the
charge of her so exhort, shall receive no damage from the synod
concerning that age.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvii-p7"></span>This is Canon xviij. of Carthage,
<span class="sc"><span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvii-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span>
418.  The reference to a former canon is to Canon j. of the second
series of the canons of the Synod of Hippo in <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvii-p7.2"></span>a.d.</span> 393.
