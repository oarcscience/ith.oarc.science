<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xii-p7"></A>This canon does not speak generally of all those who sacrificed before baptism; for if a heathen sacrificed before having embraced Christianity, he certainly could not be reproached for it after his admission.&#160; It was quite a different case with a catechumen, who had already declared for Christianity, but who, during the persecution had lost courage, and sacrificed.&#160; In this case it might be asked whether he could still be admitted to the priesthood.&#160; The Council decided that a baptized catechumen could afterwards be promoted to holy orders.</p>
