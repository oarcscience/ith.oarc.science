<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xxiii-p4"></A>We should know that not every book which is called Scripture is to be received as a safe guide.&#160; For some are tolerably sound and others are more than doubtful.&#160; Therefore the books which the inspiration of God hath given I will enumerate.&#160; [Then follows a list of the proto-canonical books of the Old Testament, Esther alone being omitted.&#160; All the deutero-canonical books are omitted.&#160; He then continues] to these some add Esther.&#160; I must now show what are the books of the New Testament.&#160; [Then follow all the books of the New Testament except the Revelation.&#160; He continues,] But some add to these the Revelation of John, but by far the majority say that it is spurious.&#160; This is the most true canon of the divinely given Scriptures.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvii.xxiii-p6"></A>We have thus four [five if we accept the Laodicean list as genuine,] different canons of Holy Scripture, all having the approval of the Council in Trullo and of the Seventh Ecumenical.&#160; From this there seems but one conclusion possible, viz.:&#160; that the approval given was not specific but general.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xvii.xxiii-p3"></A> That is the canon of Holy Scripture.&#160; I have substituted my own Epitome, in the room of Johnson&#146;s, translating the original as it is found in Beveridge&#146;s <i>Synodicon</i>, Tom. II., p. 179.&#160; It is also in Aristenus&#146;s <i>Epitome</i>.&#160; Balsamon has no scholion on this passage.</p>
