<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p2.1"></A>One</span> who had betrothed a maiden, corrupted her sister, so that she conceived.&#160; After that he married his betrothed, but she who had been corrupted hanged herself.&#160; The parties to this affair were ordered to be received among the co-standers after ten years [of penance] according to the prescribed degrees.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p5"></A>A certain body after being engaged to marry a young girl, violates her sister and then takes her to wife.&#160; The first is suffocated.&#160; All who were cognizant of the affair are to be subject to penance for ten years.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p6"></A>I have followed the usual translation &#8220;hanged herself,&#8221; which is the ordinary dictionary-meaning of <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p6.1"></A>&#7936;&#960;&#8049;&#947;&#967;&#969;</span>, but Hefele says that it signifies any and every variety of suicides.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p8"></A>In this case we have many nefarious crimes committed, fornication, unlawful marriage [i.e. with the sister of one&#146;s mistress] and murder.&#160; In that case [mentioned by St. Basil in Canon lxxviij. where only seven years penance is enjoined] there is only a nefarious marriage [i.e. with a wife&#146;s sister].</p>
