<p class="c35"><a name="viii.v.iv.xix-p5"></A>Whoso neglects the fasts of the Church, let him be anathema.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.xix-p6"></A>I have followed Hefele&#146;s translation of the last clause, with which Van Espen seems to agree, as well as Zonaras.&#160; But Hardouin and Mansi take an entirely different view and translate &#8220;if the Eustathian deliberately rejects the Church fasts.&#8221;&#160; Zonoras and Balsamon both refer to the <span class="sc"><a name="viii.v.iv.xix-p6.1"></A>LXIX</span>th of the Apostolical Canons as being the law the Eustathians violated.&#160; Balsamon suggests that the Eustathians shared the error of the Bogomiles on the subject of fasting, but I see no reason to think that this was the case; Eustathius&#146;s action seems rather to be attributable to pride, and a desire to be different and original, &#8220;I thank thee that I am not as other men are,&#8221; (as Van Espen points out).&#160; All that Socrates says (<i>H. E.</i> II., xliii.) is that &#8220;he commanded that the prescribed fasts should be neglected, and that the Lord&#146;s days should be fasted.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.xix-p7"></A>This canon is found in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratian&#146;s <i>Decretum</i>, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. viii., in an imperfect translation but not that of either Isidore or Dionysius.</p>
