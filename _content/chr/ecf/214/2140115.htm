<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.iv-p7"></A>As is well known, the ancient Church, as now the Greek Church, allowed those clergy who married before their ordination to continue to live in matrimony.&#160; Compare what was said above in the history of the Council of Nic&aelig;a, in connection with Paphnutius, concerning the celibacy and marriage of priests in the ancient Church.&#160; Accordingly this canon speaks of those clergy who have wives and live in wedlock; and Baronius, Binius, and Mitter-M&uuml;ller gave themselves useless trouble <A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A> <a name="viii.v.iv.iv-Page_94"></A>in trying to interpret it as only protecting those clergy who, though married, have since their ordination ceased to cohabit with their wives.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="viii.v.iv.iv-p8"></A>The so-called <i>Codex Ecclesi&aelig; Roman&aelig;</i> published by Quesnel, which, however, as was shown by the Ballerini,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">157</FONT></A>
 is of Gallican and not Roman origin, has not this canon, and consequently it only mentions nineteen canons of Gangra.</p>
