<span id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p2"></span>(*Greek*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p3.1"></span>Bishop</span> <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p3.2"></span>Hosius</span> said:  This is the sentence
of my mediocrity \[i.e., unworthiness\]—that, since we ought to be
gentle and patient and to be constant in compassion towards all, those
who were once advanced to clerical office in the Church by certain of
our <span id="page_432">p. 432</span> <span
id="xv.iii.iv.xx-Page_432"></span>brethren, if they are not willing to
return to the churches to which they were nominated \[or, espoused\],
should for the future not be received, and that neither Eutychianus
should continue to vindicate to himself the name of bishop, nor yet that
Musæus be accounted a bishop; but that if they should seek for lay
communion, it should not be denied them.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p4"></span>All said:  Such is our pleasure.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p5"></span>(This canon is wanting in the
*Latin*.)

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canons XVIII. and
XIX.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p8"></span>A clergyman who does not live in the
Church among whose clergy he is enrolled should not be received. 
Eutychian and Musæus shall not have the name of bishops.  But let them
be admitted to communion with the laity, if they wish.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p9"></span>Both of these canons are lacking in
the Latin.

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p10.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="xv.iii.iv.xx-p11"></span>It is clear that the reason why these
two canons do not exist in the Latin text is that they did not apply to
the Latin Church and only contained a special rule for Thessalonica.
