<span id="x.xvi.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="x.xvi.viii-p2.1"></span>If</span> any have been condemned for evil
practices by the holy Synod, or by their own bishops; and if, with his
usual lack of discrimination, Nestorius (or his followers) has
attempted, or shall hereafter attempt, uncanonically to restore such
persons to communion and to their former rank, we have declared that
they shall not be profited thereby, but shall remain deposed
nevertheless.

id="x.xvi.viii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon V.</span>

<span id="x.xvi.viii-p5"></span>If one condemned by his bishop is
received by Nestorius it shall profit him nothing.

<span id="x.xvi.viii-p6"></span>This canon is interesting as shewing
that thus early in the history of the Church, it was not unusual for
those disciplined for their faults in one communion to go to another and
there be welcomed and restored, to the overthrow of discipline and to
the lowering of the moral sense of the people to whom they minister.
