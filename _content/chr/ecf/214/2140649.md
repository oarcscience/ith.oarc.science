<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvi-p1.1"></span>Canon CXXV.  (Greek cxxvi.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvi-p2"></span>That presbyters and clerics are not
to appeal except to African Synods.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvi-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good that
presbyters, deacons, or other of the lower clergy who are to be tried,
if they question the decision of their bishops, the neighbouring bishops
having been invited by them with the consent of their bishops, shall
hear them and determine whatever separates them.  But should they think
an appeal should be carried from them, let them not carry the appeal
except to African councils or to the primates of their provinces.  But
whoso shall think of carrying an appeal across seas he shall be admitted
to communion by no one in Africa.

id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvi-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXV.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvi-p6"></span>A presbyter and deacons, who has
been condemned by his own bishop, let him appeal to the neighbouring
bishops:  but let them not cross the sea.  In Africa they shall be
excommunicated.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxvi-p7"></span>This is Canon xvij. of Carthage,
