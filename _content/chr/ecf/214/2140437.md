id="xiv.iii.liv-p1.1"></span>Canon LIII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.liv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.liv-p2.1"></span>Whereas</span> the spiritual relationship
is greater than fleshly affinity; and since it has come to our knowledge
that in some places certain persons who become sponsors to children in
holy salvation-bearing baptism, afterwards contract matrimony with their
mothers (being widows), we decree that for the future nothing of this
sort is to be done.  But if any, after the present canon, shall be
observed to do this, they must, in the first place, desist from this
unlawful marriage, and then be subjected to the penalties of
fornicators.

<span id="xiv.iii.liv-p5"></span>Godfathers cannot be permitted to be
married with the mother of their godchildren.  If any one is so joined,
let him do penance after separation.

<span id="xiv.iii.liv-p7"></span>(*Clergyman’s Vade Mecum*.)

<span id="xiv.iii.liv-p8"></span>The imperial law forbade the adopter
parent to marry his or her adopted son or daughter; for the godchild was
thought a sort of an adopted child.  See Justin., *Institut*., Lib. I.,
Tit. x.<span id="xiv.iii.liv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii.liv-p9"></span>Van Espen however refers, and to my
mind with greater truth, to Justinian’s law (xxvj of the *Cod. de
Nuptiis*) which forbids the marriage of a man with his nurse or with
whoever received him from the font, “because,” says the law, “nothing
can so incite to parental affection, and therefore induce a just
prohibition of marriage, than a bond of this sort by which, through
God’s meditation, their souls are bound together.”
