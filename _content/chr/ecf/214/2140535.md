<span id="xv.iv.iv.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xii-p1.1"></span>Canon XI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xii-p2"></span>If any presbyter, inflated against his
bishop, makes a schism, let him be anathema.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xii-p3.1"></span>All</span> the bishops said:  If any
presbyter shall have been corrected by his superior, he should ask the
neighbouring bishops that his cause be heard by them and that through
them he may be reconciled to his bishop:  but if he shall not have done
this, but, puffed up with pride, (which may God forbid!) he shall have
thought it proper to separate himself from the communion of his bishop,
and separately shall have offered the sacrifice to <span
id="page_448">p. 448</span> <span id="xv.iv.iv.xii-Page_448"></span>God,
and made a schism with certain accomplices, let him be anathema, and let
him lose his place; and if the complaint which he brought against his
bishop shall \[not\] have been found to be well founded, an enquiry
should be instituted.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xii-p6"></span>A Presbyter condemned by his bishop,
is allowed to appeal to the neighbouring bishops:  but if he shall not
make any appeal, but shall make a schism, and be elated with conceit and
shall offer the Holy Gifts to God, let him be anathema.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xii-p7"></span>See note to last canon.  The last
clause is certainly corrupt; in the council of Carthage at which it was
first adopted there is no “non,” making the meaning clear.
