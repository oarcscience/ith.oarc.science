<p class="c18"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p2.1"></A>If</span> any who have lapsed have been ordained through the ignorance, or even with the previous knowledge of the ordainers, this shall not prejudice the canon of the Church; for when they are discovered they shall be deposed.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p5"></A>Whoso had lapsed are to be deposed whether those who ordained and promoted them did so conscious of their guilt or unknowing of it.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p7"></A>The tenth canon differs from the ninth, inasmuch as it concerns only the <i>lapsi</i> and their elevation, not only to the priesthood, but to any other ecclesiastical preferment as well, and requires their deposition.&#160; The punishment of a bishop who should consciously perform such an ordination is not mentioned; but it is incontestable that the <i>lapsi</i> could not be ordained, even after having performed penance; for, as the preceding canon states, the Church requires those who were faultless.&#160; It is to be observed that the word <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p7.1"></A>&#960;&#961;&#959;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> is evidently employed here in the sense of &#8220;ordain,&#8221; and is used without any distinction from <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p7.2"></A>&#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, whilst in the synodal letter of the Council of Nic&aelig;a on the subject of the Meletians, there is a distinction between these two words, and <span class="Greek"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p7.3"></A>&#960;&#961;&#959;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> is used to signify <i>eligere</i>.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="vii.vi.xv-p8"></A>This canon is found in <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>.&#160; <i>Decretum</i>.&#160; Pars I.&#160; Dist. lxxxi.&#160; c.v.</p>
