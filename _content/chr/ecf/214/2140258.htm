<p class="c31"><a name="x.vi-p3"></A>(Labbe and Cossart, <i>Concilia</i>, Tom. III., col. 462.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="x.vi-p4"></A>And after the letter was read, Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria, said:&#160; This holy and great Synod has heard what I wrote to the most religious Nestorius, defending the right faith.&#160; I think that I have in no respect departed from the true statement of the faith, that is from the creed set forth by the holy and great synod formerly assembled at Nice.&#160; Wherefore I desire your holiness [i.e. the Council] to say whether rightly and blamelessly and in accordance with that holy synod I have written these things or no.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.vi-p5"></A>[<i>A number of bishops then gave their opinion, all favourable to Cyril; after these individual opinions the Acts continue</i> (col. 491):]</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.vi-p6"></A>And all the rest of the bishops in the order of their rank deposed to the same things, and so believed, according as the Fathers had set forth, and as the Epistle of the most holy Archbishop Cyril to Nestorius the bishop declared.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.vi-p7"></A>Palladius, the bishop of Amasea, said, The next thing to be done is to read the letter of the most reverend Nestorius, of which the most religious presbyter Peter made mention; so that we may understand whether or no it agrees with the exposition of the Nicene fathers.&#8230;</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.vi-p8"></A>And after this letter was read, Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria, said, What seems good to this holy and great synod with regard to the letter just read?&#160; Does it also seem to be consonant to the faith set forth by the holy Synod assembled in the city of Nice?</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.vi-p9"></A>[<i>The bishops, then as before, individually express their opinion, and at last the Acts continue</i> (col. 502):]</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.vi-p10"></A>All the bishops cried out together:&#160; Whoever does not anathematize Nestorius let him be anathema.&#160; Such an one the right faith anathematizes; such an one the holy Synod anathematizes.&#160; Whoever communicates with Nestorius let him be anathema!&#160; We anathematize all the apostles of Nestorius:&#160; we all anathematize Nestorius as a heretic:&#160; let all such as communicate with Nestorius be anathema, etc., etc.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.vi-p11"></A>Juvenal, the bishop of Jerusalem said:&#160; Let the letter of the most holy and reverend C&aelig;lestine, archbishop of the Church of Rome, be read, which he wrote concerning the faith.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.vi-p12"></A>[<i>The letter of C&aelig;lestine was read and no opinion expressed</i>.]</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.vi-p13"></A>Peter the presbyter of Alexandria, and primicerius of the notaries said:&#160; Altogether in agreement with the things just read are those which his holiness Cyril our most pious bishop wrote, which I now have at hand, and will read if your piety so shall order.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="x.vi-p14"></A>[<i>The letter was read which begins thus</i>:]</p>
