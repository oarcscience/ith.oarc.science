<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.c-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.c-p2.1"></A>We</span> have further learned that, in the regions of the Armenians, certain persons boil joints of meat within the sanctuary and offer portions to the priests, distributing it after the Jewish fashion.&#160; Wherefore, that we may keep the church undefiled, we decree that it is not lawful for any priest to seize the separate portions of flesh meat from those who offer them, but they are to be content with what he that offers pleases to give them; and further we decree that such offering be made outside the church.&#160; And if any one does not thus, let him be cut off.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="xiv.iii.c-p5"></A>There are some who like the Jews cook meat in the holy places.&#160; Whoever permits this, or receives aught from them, is not fit to be priest.&#160; But if any one should of his own free choice offer it, then he might receive as much as the offerer chose to give him, provided the offer were made outside the church.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.c-p6"></A>A similar Judaizing superstitious custom was also found in the West, of which Walafrid Strabo gives an account in the IX. Century (<i>De Rebus Ecclesiasticis</i>, cap. xviii.).</p>
