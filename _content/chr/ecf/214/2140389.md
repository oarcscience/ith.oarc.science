<span id="xiv.iii.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>Canon VI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.vi-p2.1"></span>Since</span> it is declared in the apostolic
canons that of those who are advanced to the clergy unmarried, only
lectors and cantors are able to marry; we also, maintaining this,
determine that henceforth it is in nowise lawful for any subdeacon,
deacon or presbyter after his ordination to contract matrimony but if he
shall have dared to do so, let him be deposed.  And if any of those who
enter the clergy, wishes to be joined to a wife in lawful marriage
before he is ordained subdeacon, deacon, or presbyter, let it be done.

<span id="xiv.iii.vi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.vi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.vi-p5"></span>If any ordained person contracts
matrimony, let him be deposed.  If he wishes to be married he should
become so before his ordination.

<span id="xiv.iii.vi-p6"></span>Aristenus points out how this canon
annuls the tenth canon of Ancyra, which allows a deacon and even a
presbyter to marry after ordination and continue in his ministry,
provided at the time of his ordination he had in the presence of
witnesses declared his inability to remain chaste or his desire to
marry.  This present canon follows the <span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.vi-p6.1"></span>XXVI</span>th of the Apostolic canons.

<span id="xiv.iii.vi-p7"></span>The last clause of this canon, limited
in its application to subdeacons, is found in the *Corpus Juris
Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. XXXII., c. vi.
