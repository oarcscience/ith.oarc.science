<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xcix-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.xcix-p2.1"></A>He</span> who brings to the intercourse of marriage a woman who is betrothed to another man who is still alive, is to lie under the charge of adultery.</p> 
<p class="c31"><a name="xiv.iii.xcix-p3"></A><A NAME="page_407"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 407</FONT></A> <a name="xiv.iii.xcix-Page_407"></A><span class="c4"><a name="xiv.iii.xcix-p3.1"></A>Notes.</span></p> 
<p class="c36"><a name="xiv.iii.xcix-p4"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xiv.iii.xcix-p4.1"></A>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVIII.</span></p> 
<p class="c35"><a name="xiv.iii.xcix-p5"></A>He is an adulterer who takes one espoused to some one else.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xiv.iii.xcix-p6"></A>Aristenus&#146;s commentary on this canon is <span class="Greek"><a name="xiv.iii.xcix-p6.1"></A>&#931;&#945;&#966;&#8053;&#962;</span>.&#160; A more extraordinary estimate of it could hardly be made.&#160; So far from the meaning being &#8220;perspicuous,&#8221; as the Latin translation has it, the meaning seems to be past finding out; for, as Van Espen remarks, a man who sins with a betrothed woman is certainly not an &#8220;adulterer.&#8221;&#160; He tries therefore to introduce the idea that though he is not an adulterer, yet he is to be punished as if he were.&#160; But the Greek hardly seems patient of this meaning, and the Ancient Epitome says in so many words that he is an adulterer.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xiv.iii.xcix-p7"></A>On account of this difficulty some have supposed that the espousals here mentioned were not <i>de futuro</i> but <i>de pr&#339;senti</i>, and that therefore it was the case of stealing a real wife of another man.&#160; But this explanation also is involved in many difficulties.</p>
