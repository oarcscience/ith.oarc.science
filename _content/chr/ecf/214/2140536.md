<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Canon XII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p2"></span>If any bishop out of Synod time shall
have fallen under accusation, let his cause be heard by 12 bishops.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p3.1"></span>Felix</span> the bishop, said:  I
suggest, according to the statutes of the ancient councils, that if any
bishop (which may God forbid!) shall have fallen under any accusation,
and there shall have been too great necessity to wait for the summoning
of a majority of the bishops, that he may not rest under accusation, let
his cause be heard by 12 bishops; and let a presbyter be heard by six
bishops with his own bishop, and a deacon shall be heard by three.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p6"></span>When a bishop is to be tried, if the
whole synod does not sit, let at least twelve bishops take up the
matter; and for the case of a presbyter, six and his own diocesan; and
for the case of a deacon, three.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p7"></span>This is Canon x. of the Synod of
Genethlius.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p9"></span>Hereby must be meant African canons;
that under Gratus \[<span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span> 348\] had decreed the same
thing.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xiii-p10"></span>Who was the bishop’s judge at the
first instance does not appear by this canon; but it is natural to
suppose it was the Primate.  It is probable that this canon is to be
understood of hearing upon an appeal, because it is certain that a
priest’s cause, at the first instance, was to be tried before the bishop
(see Can. 10, 11).  And therefore the latter part of the canon can be
understood of no hearing but by way of appeal, nor by consequence the
former.  And this seems more clear by Can. Afr. 29.
