<p class="c34"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p1"></A> <span class="c4"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p1.1"></A>Canon XXI.</span></p> 
<p class="c50"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p2"></A>That monks are not to leave their monasteries and go into others.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p3.1"></A>A monk</span> or nun ought not to leave the monastery to which he or she is attached, and betake themselves to others.&#160; But if one do this, he ought to be received as a guest.&#160; It is not however proper that he be made a member of the monastery, without the consent of his hegumenos.</p>

<p class="c36"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p5"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p5.1"></A>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXI.</span></p> 
<p class="c35"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p6"></A>It is not allowed to a monk or a nun to leave her own house and enter another; but if he (or she) enters let (him or her) be received as a guest; but let him (or her) not be admitted at all nor given hospitality contrary to the will of the superior.</p> 
<p class="c36"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p7"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p7.1"></A>Aristenus</span>.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p8"></A>The present canon does not allow a monk or a nun who goes to another house to be received into, nor even to be admitted as a guest, lest by force of necessity he be led astray to worldly things and so remain.&#160; Moreover it does not permit a woman to be admitted and received and reckoned in the number of the sisters without the consent of the superior.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p9"></A>It seems to me that in Aristenus an <span class="Greek"><a name="xvi.xiv.xxi-p9.1"></A>&#959;&#8016;&#954;</span> must have crept into the text and that the first sentence should read as now but omitting the &#8220;not.&#8221;&#160; This makes him agree with Zonaras who says &#8220;the man must be received as a guest lest he go to a profane tavern and be forced to associate with those who have never learned how to live decently.&#8221;&#160; It is clear that the &#8220;superior&#8221; referred to is that of the house whence the monk or nun went forth.</p>
