Atticus, bishop of Constantinople to the same.

id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxvii-p3.1"></span>To</span> our holy lords, and rightly
most blessed brethren and fellow bishops, Aurelius, Valentine, and <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492) to the other beloved ones met together
in the Synod held at Carthage, Atticus the bishop.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxxvii-p5"></span>By our son Marcellus the
subdeacon, I have received with all thanksgiving the writings of your
holiness, praising the Lord that I enjoyed the blessing of so many of my
brethren.  O my lords and most blessed brethren, ye have written asking
me to send you most accurate copies of the canons enacted at the city of
Nice, the metropolis of Bithynia, by the Fathers for the exposition of
the faith.  And who is there that would deny to his brethren the common
faith, or the statutes decreed by the Fathers.  Wherefore by the same
son of mine, Marcellus, your subdeacon, who was in great haste, I have
sent to you the canons in full as they were adopted by the Fathers in
the city of Nice; and I ask of you that your holy synod would have me
much in your prayers.  The subscription.  May our God keep your
sanctity, as we desire, most holy brethren.
