<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p2"></span>Concerning Quodvultdeus, the
bishop.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p3.1"></span>In</span> the case of Quodvultdeus of
Centuria, it pleased all the bishops that no one should communicate with
him until his cause should be brought to a conclusion, for his accuser
when he sought to bring the cause before our council, upon being asked
whether he was willing with him to be tried before the bishops, at first
said that he was, but on another day answered that he was not willing,
and went away.  Under these circumstances to deprive him of his
bishoprick, before the conclusion of his cause was known, could commend
itself to no Christian as a just act.

id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
LXXXVII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p6"></span>Since Quodvultdeus at first
promised to come to our synod when his opposer had asked that he be
admitted, and afterwards withdrew, saying that that was displeasing to
him, he should be excommunicated, until the cause is finished.  But it
is not just that he be deposed before sentence is given.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p7"></span>This canon is part of Canon ij.
of Synod of Milevis, <span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.lxxxviii-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 402.
