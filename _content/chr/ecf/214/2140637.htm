<p class="c50"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxiv-p2"></A>That without the grace of God we can do no good thing.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxiv-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxiv-p3.1"></A>It</span> seemed good that whosoever should say that the grace of justification was given to us only that we might be able more readily by grace to perform what we were ordered to do through our free will; as if though grace was not given, although not easily, yet nevertheless we could even without grace fulfil the divine commandments, let him be anathema.&#160; For the Lord spake concerning the fruits of the commandments, when he said:&#160; &#8220;Without me ye can do nothing,&#8221; and not &#8220;Without me ye could do it but with difficulty.&#8221;</p>
