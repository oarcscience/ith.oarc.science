<span id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XVII.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p2.1"></span>If</span> any one having received the
ordination of a bishop, and having been appointed to preside over a
people, shall not accept his ministry, and will not be persuaded to
proceed to the Church entrusted to him, he shall be excommunicated until
he, being constrained, accept it, or until a full synod of the bishops
of the province shall have determined concerning him.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p5"></span>Whoso has received orders and
abandoned them let him be excommunicated, until he shall have repented
and been received.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p6.1"></span>Zonaras.</span>

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p7"></span>If any one called to the rule of
the people refuse to undertake that office and ministry, let him be
removed from communion, that is separated, until he accept the
position.  But should he persist in his refusal, he can by no means be
absolved from his separation, unless perchance the full synod shall take
some action in his case.  For it is possible that he may assign
reasonable causes why he should be excused from accepting the prelature
of<span id="page_117">p. 117</span> <span
id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-Page_117"></span>fered him, reasons which would meet
with the approbation of the synod.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p8"></span>Balsamon explains the canon in the
same sense and adds that by “ordination” here is intended ordination
proper, not merely election, as some have held.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p9"></span>Compare with this Apostolic Canon
XXXVI.

<span id="viii.vi.iv.xvii-p10"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. XCII., C. vij. 
The Roman Correctors note that Dionysius’s version is nearer the Greek.
