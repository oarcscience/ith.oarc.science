<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p8"></A>Compare the eighth and tenth canons of the Synod of Antioch of 341, the thirteenth of the Synod of Ancyra, and the second clause of the sixth canon of the Synod of Sardica.&#160; The above canon orders that from henceforth, in the place of the rural bishops, priests of higher rank shall act as visitors of the country dioceses and country clergy.&#160; Dionysius Exiguus, Isidore, the Greek commentators, Van Espen, Remi Ceillier, Neander, and others thus interpret this canon; but Herbst, in the <i>T&uuml;bingen Review</i>, translates the word (<span class="Greek"><a name="viii.vii.iii.lxii-p8.1"></A>&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#945;&#8055;</span> ) not visitors but physicians&#8212;physicians of the soul,&#8212;and for this he appeals to passages from the Fathers of the Church collected by Suicer in his <i>Thesaurus</i>.</p>
