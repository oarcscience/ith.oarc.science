<p class="c18"><a name="xvi.vii-p4"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xvi.vii-p4.1"></A>Constantine</span>, the most holy bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, said:&#160; Since I, unworthy that I am, find that the letter which has just been read, which was sent from the East to Tarasius the most holy archbishop and ecumenical patriarch, is in no sense changed from that confession of faith which he himself had before made, to these I consent and become of one mind, receiving and saluting with honour the holy and venerable images.&#160; But the worship of adoration I reserve alone to the supersubstantial and life-giving Trinity.&#160; And those who are not so minded, and do not so teach I cast out of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and I smite them with anathema, and I deliver them over to the lot of those who deny the incarnation and the bodily economy of Christ our true God.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xvi.vii-p8"></A>By false translation and misunderstanding the Frankish bishops subsequently at the Synod of Frankfort, <span class="sc"><a name="xvi.vii-p8.1"></A>a.d.</span> 794, and also in the Carolingian books (iii. 17), understood this to mean that a demand had been made at Nic&aelig;a that the same devotion should be offered to the images as to the Most Holy Trinity.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xvi.vii-p9"></A>Under these circumstances it is clear that the Franks could do nothing but reject the decrees.&#160; I have treated of this whole matter elsewhere.</p>
