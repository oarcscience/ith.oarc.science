<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p1.1"></span>Canon LX.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p2"></span>\[*N. B.—This Canon is of most
questionable genuineness*.\]

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p3.1"></span>These</span> are all the books of Old
Testament appointed to be read:  1, Genesis of the world; 2, The Exodus
from Egypt; 3, Leviticus; 4, Numbers; 5, Deuteronomy; 6, Joshua, the son
of Nun; 7, Judges, Ruth; 8, Esther; 9, Of the Kings, First and Second;
10, Of the Kings, Third and Fourth; 11, Chronicles, First and Second;
12, Esdras, First and Second; 13, The Book of Psalms; 14, The Proverbs
of Solomon; 15, Ecclesiastes; 16, The Song of Songs; 17, Job; 18, The
Twelve Prophets; 19, Isaiah; 20, Jeremiah, and Baruch, the Lamentations,
and the Epistle; 21, Ezekiel; 22, Daniel.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p4"></span>And these are the books of the New
Testament:  Four Gospels, according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; The
Acts of the Apostles; Seven Catholic Epistles, to wit, one of James, two
of Peter, three of John, one of Jude; Fourteen Epistles of Paul, one to
the Romans, two to the Corinthians, one to the Galatians, one to the
Ephesians, one to the Philippians, one to the Colossians, two to the
Thessalonians, one to the Hebrews, two to Timothy, one to Titus, and one
to Philemon.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon LX.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p7"></span>But of the new, the four
Gospels—of Matthew, of Mark, of Luke, of John; Acts; Seven Catholic
epistles, viz. of James one, of Peter two, of John three, of Jude one;
of Paul fourteen, viz.:  to the Romans one, to the Corinthians two, to
the Galatians one, to the Ephesians one, to the Phillipians one, to the
Colossians one, to the Thessalonians two, to the Hebrews one, to Timothy
two, to Titus one, and to Philemon one.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p8"></span>It will be noticed that while this
canon has often been used for controversial purposes it really has
little or no value in this connexion, for the absence of the Revelation
of St. John from the New Testament to all orthodox Christians is, to say
the least, as fatal to its reception as an ecumenical definition of the
canon of Holy Scripture, as the absence of the book of Wisdom, etc.,
from the Old Testament is to its reception by those who accept the books
of what we may call for convenience the Greek canon, as distinguished
from the Hebrew, as canonical.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p9"></span>We may therefore leave this
question wholly out of account, and merely consider the matter from the
evidence we possess.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p10"></span>In 1777 Spittler published a
special treatise <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198) to shew that
the list of scriptural books was no part of the original canon adopted
by Laodicea.  Hefele gives the following resume of his argument: <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199)

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p13"></span>(a)  That Dionysius Exiguus has
not this canon in his translation of the Laodicean decrees.  It might,
indeed, be said with Dallæus and Van Espen, that Dionysius omitted this
list of the books of Scripture because in Rome, where he composed his
work, another by Innocent I. was in general use.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p14"></span>(b)  But, apart from the fact
that Dionysius is always a most faithful translator, this sixtieth canon
is also omitted by John of Antioch, one of the most esteemed and oldest
Greek collectors of canons, who could have had no such reasons as
Dionysius for his omission.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-p15"></span>(c)  Lastly, Bishop Martin of
Braga in the sixth century, though he has the fifty-ninth, has also not
included in his collection the sixtieth canon so nearly related to it,
nor does the Isidorian translation appear at first to have <span
id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span
id="viii.vii.iii.lxv-Page_160"></span>had this canon. <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200)   Herbst, in the *Tübingen Review*,
also accedes to these arguments of Spittler’s, as did Fuchs and others
before him.  Mr. Ffoulkes in his article on the Council of Laodicea in
Smith and Cheetham’s *Dictionary of Christian Antiquities* at length
attempts to refute all objections, and affirms the genuineness of the
list, but his conclusions can hardly be accepted when the careful
consideration and discussion of the matter by Bishop Westcott is kept in
mind.  (*History of the Canon of the New Testament*, IIId. Period,
chapter ii. \[p. 428 of the 4th Edition.\])
