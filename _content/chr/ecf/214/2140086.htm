<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p2.1"></A>They</span> who practice divination, and follow the customs of the heathen, or who take men to their houses for the invention of sorceries, or for lustrations, fall under the canon of five years&#146; [penance], according to the prescribed degrees; that is, three years as prostrators, and two of prayer without oblation.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p5"></A>Whoso uses vaticination and whoso introduces anyone into his house for the sake of making a poison or a lustration let him be subject to penance for five years.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p6"></A>I read <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p6.1"></A>&#7952;&#952;&#957;&#8182;&#957;</span> for <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p6.2"></A>&#967;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span> and accordingly translate &#8220;of the heathen.&#8221;</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxv-p8"></A>It is greatly to be desired that bishops and pastors to-day would take example from the fathers of Ancyra and devote their attention strenuously to eliminate superstition from the people, and would expound with animation to the people the enormity of this crime.</p>
