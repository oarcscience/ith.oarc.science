<p class="c35"><a name="viii.iv.iii.i-p8"></A>If a presbyter marries he shall be deposed from his order.&#160; If he commits adultery or whoredom he shall be expelled, and shall be put to penance.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iv.iii.i-p10"></A>A presbyter who marries is removed from the exercise of the priesthood but retains his honour and seat.&#160; But he that commits fornication or adultery is cast forth altogether and put to penance.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iv.iii.i-p12"></A>These fathers [i.e. of Neoc&aelig;sarea] shew how much graver seemed to them the sin of the presbyter who after ordination committed fornication or adultery, than his who took a wife.&#160; For the former they declare shall simply be deposed from his order or deprived of the dignity of the Priesthood, but the latter is to &#8220;be altogether cast out, and put to penance.&#8221;&#8230;Therefore such a presbyter not only did they remove from the priestly functions, or the dignity of the priesthood, but perfectly or altogether cast him out of the Church.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iv.iii.i-p13"></A>This canon Gratian has inserted in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>.&#160; <i>Decretum</i>.&#160; Pars I., Dist. xxviii., c. ix.&#160; Gratian has followed Isidore in adding after the word &#8220;penance&#8221; the words &#8220;among the laity&#8221; (<i>inter laicos</i>) which do not occur in the Greek, (as is noted by the Roman Correctors) nor in the version of Dionysius Exiguus; these same correctors fall however themselves into a still graver error in supposing that criminous clerks in the early days of the Church were sent out to wander over the country, as Van Espen well points out.</p>
