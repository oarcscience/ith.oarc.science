id="xiv.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>Canon XVIII.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xix-p2.1"></span>Those</span> clerics who in consequence of
a barbaric incursion or on account of any other circumstance have gone
abroad, we order to return again to their churches after the cause has
passed away, or when the incursion of the barbarians is at an end.  Nor
are they to leave them for long without cause.  If anyone shall not have
returned according to the direction of this present canon—let him be cut
off until he shall return to his own church.  And the same shall be the
punishment of the bishop who received him.

<span id="xiv.iii.xix-p5"></span>Whoever has emigrated on account of an
invasion of the barbarians, shall return to the Church to whose clergy
he belongs as soon as the incursion ceases.  But if he shall not do so,
he shall be cut off together with him to whom he has gone.

<span id="xiv.iii.xix-p7"></span>The Fathers are worthy of great
praise.  For having regard to the honour of the ecclesiastical order and
of each bishop, they have decreed that clergymen, who from just and
valid causes have gone forth without letters dimissory from those who
ordained them, should return to their own clergy soon as the cause which
drove them forth ceases; and that they should not be enrolled on the
clergy list of any other church.  But whosoever cannot be persuaded to
return is to be cut off, as well as the bishop who detains him.  But
someone will say, If a bishop who does such a thing is cut off by his
Metropolitan; and likewise if a Metropolitan spurns this canon he is
punished by the Patriarch.  But if an autocephalous archbishop or a
Patriarch other than the Patriarch of Constantinople (for he has a
faculty for doing so) should be convicted of a breach of this Canon, by
whom would he be cut off?  I suppose by the Supreme Pontiff <span
