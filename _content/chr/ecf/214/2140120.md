id="viii.v.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>If</span> any one shall remain virgin, or
observe continence, abstaining from marriage because he abhors it, and
not on account of the beauty and holiness of virginity itself, let him
be anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.ix-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.ix-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon IX.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.ix-p5"></span>Whoso preserves virginity not on
account of its beauty but because he abhors marriage, let him be
anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.ix-p6"></span>The lesson taught by this canon and
that which follows is that the practice of even the highest Christian
virtues, such as the preservation of virginity, if it does not spring
from a worthy motive is only deserving of execration.

<span id="viii.v.iv.ix-p8"></span>Virginity is most beautiful of all,
and continence is likewise beautiful, but only if we fol<span

them for their own sake and because of the sanctification which comes
from them.  But should anyone embrace virginity, because he detests
marriage as impure, and keep himself chaste, and abstains from commerce
with women and marriage, because he thinks that they are in themselves
wicked, he is subjected by this canon to the penalty of anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.ix-p9"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. v., and
again Dist. xxxi., c. ix.
