<span id="xiv.iii.cii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.cii-p2.1"></span>The</span> great and divine Apostle Paul
with loud voice calls man created in the image of God, the body and
temple of Christ.  Excelling, therefore, every sensible creature, he who
by the saving Passion has attained to the celestial dignity, eating and
drinking Christ, is fitted in all respects for eternal life, sanctifying
his soul and body by the participation of divine grace.  Wherefore, if
any one wishes to be a participator of the immaculate Body in the time
of the Synaxis, and to offer himself for the communion, <span
id="page_408">p. 408</span> <span id="xiv.iii.cii-Page_408"></span>let
him draw near, arranging his hands in the form of a cross, and so let
him receive the communion of grace.  But such as, instead of their
hands, make vessels of gold or other materials for the reception of the
divine gift, and by these receive the immaculate communion, we by no
means allow to come, as preferring inanimate and inferior matter to the
image of God.  But if any one shall be found imparting the immaculate
Communion to those who bring vessels of this kind, let him be cut off as
well as the one who brings them.

<span id="xiv.iii.cii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.cii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon CI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.cii-p5"></span>Whoever comes to receive the Eucharist
holds his hands in the form of a cross, and takes it with his mouth;
whoever shall prepare a receptacle of gold or of any other material
instead of his hand, shall be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.cii-p7"></span>At first, perchance, this was invented
from pious feelings, because the hand which came in contact with base
and unworthy things was not worthy to receive the Lord’s body, but, as
time went on, piety was turned to the injury of the soul, so that those
who did this when they came to receive with an arrogant and insolent
bearing, were preferred to the poor.

<span id="xiv.iii.cii-p9"></span>(*Cateches. Mystagog*. v. <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387) )

<span id="xiv.iii.cii-p11"></span>When thou goest to receive communion
go not with thy wrists extended, nor with thy fingers separated, but
placing thy left hand as a throne for thy right, which is to receive so
great a King, and in the hollow of the palm receive the body of Christ,
saying, Amen.

Fide Orthodoxa*, lib. iv., cap. xiv.  On the whole matter cf. Card.
Bona, *De Rebus Lit*., lib. ii., cap. xvij., n. 3.
