<p class="c35"><a name="viii.iv.iii.v-p5"></A>If a catechumen falls into a fault and if while a kneeler he sins no more, let him be among the hearers; but should he sin while among the hearers, let him be cast out altogether.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iv.iii.v-p7"></A>There are two sorts of catechumens.&#160; For some have only just come in and these, as still imperfect, go out immediately after the reading of the scriptures and of the Gospels.&#160; But there are others who have been for some time in preparation and have attained some perfection; these wait after the Gospel for the prayers for the catechumens, and when they hear the words &#8220;Catechumens, bow down your heads to the Lord,&#8221; they kneel down.&#160; These, as being more perfect, having tasted the good words of God, if they fall, are removed from their position; and are placed with the &#8220;hearers&#8221;; but if any happen to sin while &#8220;hearers&#8221; they are cast out of the Church altogether.</p>
