<span id="x.ix.iii-p6"></span>If any one asserts that, at the union of
the Logos with the flesh, the divine Essence moved from one place to
another; or says that the flesh is capable of receiving the divine
nature, and that it has been partially united with the flesh; or
ascribes to the flesh, <span id="page_211">p. 211</span> <span
id="x.ix.iii-Page_211"></span>by reason of its reception of God, an
extension to the infinite and boundless, and says that God and man are
one and the same in nature; let him be anathema.
