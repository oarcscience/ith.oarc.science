<p class="c35"><a name="viii.v.iv.x-p5"></A>Whoso treats arrogantly those joined in matrimony, let him be anathema.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.x-p6"></A>On this point the fathers had spoken long before, I cite two as examples.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.x-p8"></A>(Epist. I., 38, Lightfoot&#146;s translation.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.x-p9"></A>So in our case let the whole body be saved in Christ Jesus, and let each man be subject unto his neighbour, according as also he was appointed with his special grace.&#160; Let not the strong neglect the weak; and let the weak respect the strong.&#160; Let the rich minister aid to the poor and let the poor give thanks to God, because he hath given him one through whom his wants may be supplied.&#160; Let the wise display his wisdom, not in words, but in good works.&#160; He that is lowly in mind, let him not bear testimony to himself, but leave testimony to be borne to him by his neighbour.&#160; He that is pure in the flesh, let him be so,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">158</FONT></A>
 and not boast, knowing that it is Another who bestoweth his continence upon him.&#160; Let us consider, brethren, of what matter we were made; who and what manner of beings we were, when we came into the world; from what a sepulchre and what darkness he that moulded and created us brought us into his world, having prepared his benefits aforehand ere ever we were born.&#160; Seeing therefore that we have all these things from him, we ought in all things to give thanks to him, to whom be the glory for ever and ever.&#160; Amen.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.x-p12"></A>(Epist. ad Polyc. 5, Lightfoot&#146;s translation.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.x-p13"></A>Flee evil arts, or rather hold thou discourse about these, Tell my sisters to love the Lord and to be content with their husbands in flesh and in spirit.&#160; In like manner also charge my brothers in the name of Jesus Christ to love their wives, as the Lord loved the Church.&#160; If anyone is able to abide in chastity to the honour of the flesh of the Lord, let him so abide without boasting.&#160; If he boast, he is lost; and if it be known beyond the bishop, he is polluted.&#160; It becometh men and women, too, when they marry to unite themselves with the consent of the bishop, that the marriage may be after the Lord and not after concupiscence.&#160; Let all things be done to the honour of God.</p>
