<p class="c35"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p5"></A>An adulteress and an adulterer are to be cut off for seven years.</p> 
<p class="c36"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p6"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p6.1"></A>Hefele.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p7"></A>The simplest explanation of this canon is &#8220;that the man or woman who has violated the marriage bond shall undergo a seven years&#146; penance&#8221;; but many reject this explanation, because the text says <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p7.1"></A>&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#8059;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> and consequently can refer only to the husband.&#160; Fleury and Routh think the canon speaks, as does the seventieth of Elvira, of a woman who has broken the marriage tie with the knowledge and consent of her husband.&#160; The husband would therefore in this case be punished for this permission, just as if he had himself committed adultery.&#160; Van Espen has given another explanation:&#160; &#8220;That he who marries a woman already divorced for adultery is as criminal as if he had himself committed adultery.&#8221;&#160; But this explanation appears to us more forced than that already given; and we think that the Greek commentators Balsamon and Zonaras were right in giving the explanation we have offered first as the most natural.&#160; They think that the Synod punished every adulterer, whether man or woman, by a seven years&#146; penance.&#160; There is no reason for making a mistake because only the word <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p7.2"></A>&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> occurs in the passage in which the penalty is fixed; for <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p7.3"></A>&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> here means the guilty party, and applies equally to the woman and the man:&#160; besides, in the preceding canon the masculine <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xxi-p7.4"></A>&#8005;&#963;&#959;&#953; &#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> includes young men and young women also.&#160; It is probable that the Trullan Synod of 692, in forming its eighty-seventh canon, had in view the twentieth of Ancyra. &#160;The sixty-ninth canon of Elvira condemned to a lighter punishment&#8212;only five years of penance&#8212;him who had been only once guilty of adultery.</p>
