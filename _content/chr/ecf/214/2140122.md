id="viii.v.iv.xi-p2.1"></span>If</span> anyone shall despise those who
out of faith make love-feasts and invite the brethren in honour of the
Lord, and is not willing to accept these invitations because he despises
what is done, let him be anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.xi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XI.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.xi-p5"></span>Whoso spurns those who invite to the
agape, and who when invited will not communicate with these, let him be
anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xi-p6"></span>There are few subjects upon which
there has been more difference of opinion than upon the history and
significance of the Agape or Love-feasts of the Early Church.  <span
id="page_97">p. 97</span> <span id="viii.v.iv.xi-Page_97"></span>To cite
here any writers would only mislead the reader; I shall therefore merely
state the main outline of the discussion and leave every man to study
the matter for himself.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xi-p7"></span>All agree that these feasts are
referred to by St. Jude in his <span
id="viii.v.iv.xi-p7.1"></span>Epistle, and, although Dean Plumptre has
denied it (Smith and Cheetham, *Dict. Christ. Antiq*., s.v. Agapæ), most
writers add St. Paul in the [1 Cor.
11](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#000)<span
id="viii.v.iv.xi-p7.2"></span>.  Estius (*in loc*.) argues with great
cogency that the expression “Lord’s Supper” in Holy Scripture never
means the Holy Eucharist, but the love-feast, and in this view he has
been followed by many moderns, but the prevalent opinion has been the
opposite.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xi-p8"></span>There is also much discussion as to
the order in which the Agapæ and the celebrations of the Holy Sacrament
were related, some holding that the love-feast preceded, others that it
followed the Divine Mysteries.  There seems no doubt that in early times
the two became separated, the Holy Sacrament being celebrated in the
morning and the Agapæ in the evening.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xi-p9"></span>All agree that these feasts were at
first copies of the religious feasts common to the Jews and to the
heathen world, and that soon abuses of one sort or another came in, so
that they fell into ill repute and were finally prohibited at the
Council in Trullo.  This canon of Gangra is found in the *Corpus Juris
Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xlii., c. i.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xi-p10"></span>Van Espen is of opinion that the
Agapæ of our canon have no real connexion with the religious feasts of
earlier days, but were merely meals provided by the rich for the poor,
and with this view Hefele agrees.  But the matter is by no means plain. 
In fact at every point we are met with difficulties and uncertainties.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xi-p11"></span>There would seem to be little doubt
that the “pain beni” of the French Church, and the “Antidoron” of the
Eastern Church are remains of the ancient Agapæ.

<span id="viii.v.iv.xi-p12"></span>The meaning, however, of this canon
is plain enough, to wit, people must not despise, out of a false
asceticism, feasts made for the poor by those of the faithful who are
rich and liberal. <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158)
