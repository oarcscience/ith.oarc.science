<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xxxiv-p8"></A>Fuchs (<i>Biblioth. der Kirchenvers</i>., vol. iij., p. 5) thinks the text is corrupt in the last sentence and should be corrected by Canon x. of the Council of Carthage of 421, so as to read, &#8220;that which is left by will to a rural church in the diocese must not be applied to the Mother Church through the usurpation of the bishop.&#8221;</p>

 day before the Calends of July, at Carthage.&#160; In this council the proconsular bishops were chosen as legates to the Council of Adrumetum.</p> 
<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xxxiv-p19"></A>Of a Council of Carthage at which many statutes were made.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xxxiv-p20"></A>In the consulate of those most illustrious men, C&aelig;sarius and Atticus, on the vth day before the Calends of September in the secretarium of the restored basilica, when Aurelius the bishop, together with the bishops, had taken his seat, the deacons also standing by, and Victor the old man of Puppiana, Tutus of Migirpa and Evangel of Assuri.</p> 
<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xxxiv-p21"></A>The Allocution of Aurelius the bishop of Carthage to the bishops.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xxxiv-p22"></A>Aurelius, the bishop, said:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">438</FONT></A>
&#160; After the day fixed for the council, as ye remember, most blessed brethren, we sat and waited for the legations of all the African provinces to assemble upon the day, as I have said, set by our missive; but when the letter of our <A NAME="page_459"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 459</FONT></A> <a name="xv.iv.iv.xxxiv-Page_459"></A>Byzacene bishops had been read, that was read to your charity, which they had discussed with me who had anticipated the time and day of the council; also it was read by our brethren Honoratus and Urban, who are to-day present with us in this council, sent as the legation of the Sitifensine Province.&#160; For our brother Reginus of the Vege [t]selitane&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">439</FONT></A>
 Church,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">440</FONT></A>
 the letters sent to my littleness by Crescentian and Aurelius, our fellow-bishops, of the first sees of the [two] Numidias, in which writings your charity will see with me how they promised that either they themselves would be good enough to come or else that they would send legates according to custom to this council; but this it seems they did not do at all, the legates of Mauritania Sitifensis, who had come so great a distance gave notice that they could stay no longer; and, therefore, brethren, if it seem good to your charity, let the letters of our Byzacene brethren, as also the breviary, which they joined to the same letter, be read to this assembly, so that if by any chance they are not entirely satisfactory to your charity, such things in the breviary may be changed for the better after diligent examination.&#160; For this very thing our brother and fellow-bishop of the primatial see, a man justly conspicuous for his gravity and prudence, Mizonius, demanded in a letter he addressed to my littleness.&#160; If therefore it meets with your approval, let there be read the things which have been adopted and let each by itself be considered by your charity.</p>
