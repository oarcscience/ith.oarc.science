<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p2.1"></A>No</span> Christian shall forsake the martyrs of Christ, and turn to false martyrs, that is, to those of the heretics, or those who formerly were heretics; for they are aliens from God.&#160; Let those, therefore, who go after them, be anathema.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p5"></A>Whoso honours an heretical pseudo-martyr let him be anathema.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p7"></A>This canon forbids the honouring of martyrs not belonging to the orthodox church.&#160; The number of Montanist martyrs of Phrygia was probably the occasion of this canon.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxix-p8"></A>The phrase which I have translated &#8220;to those who formerly were heretics&#8221; has caused great difficulty to all translators and scarcely two agree.&#160; Hammond reads &#8220;those who have been reputed to have been heretics;&#8221; and with him Fulton agrees, but wrongly (as I think) by omitting the &#8220;to.&#8221;&#160; Lambert translates &#8220;to those who before were heretics&#8221; and correctly.&#160; With him agrees Van Espen, thus, <i>vel eos qui prius heretici fuere</i>.</p>
