<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XVII.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Defilers</span> of themselves with
beasts, being also leprous, who have infected others \[with the leprosy
of this crime\], the holy Synod commands to pray among the hiemantes.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p5"></span>A leper who goes in to a beast or
even to leprous women, shall pray with the hybernantes.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p6"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p6.1"></span>Λεπρώσαντας</span> is from <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p6.2"></span>λεπρόω</span> not
from <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p6.3"></span>λεπράω</span> and therefore cannot
mean “have been lepers,” but “have made others rough and scabby.”  It is
only in the passive and in Alexandrian Greek that it has the meaning to
become leprous.  *Vide* Liddell and Scott.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p7"></span>There seems but little doubt that
the word is to be understood spiritually as suggested above.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p8"></span>The last word of the canon is
also a source of confusion.  Both Beveridge and Routh understand by the
<span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p8.1"></span>χειμαζόμενοι</span> those possessed
with devils.  Suicer however (*Thesaurus*) thinks that the penitents of
the lowest degree are intended, who had no right to enter the church,
but were exposed in the open porch to the inclemencies (<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p8.2"></span>χειμών</span>) of
the weather.  But, after all it matters little, as the possessed also
were forced to remain in the same place, and shared the same name.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p9"></span>Besides the grammatical reason
for the meaning of <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p9.1"></span>λεπρώσαντας</span> given above there
is another argument of Hefele’s, as follows:

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p10.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11"></span>It is clear that <span
class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.1"></span>λεπρώσαντας</span> cannot possibly
mean “those who have been lepers”; for there is no reason to be seen why
those who were cured of that malady should have to remain outside the
church among the flentes.  Secondly, it is clear that the words <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.2"></span>λεπροὺς
ὄντας</span>, etc. are added to give force to the expression <span
class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.3"></span>ἀλογευσάμενοι</span>.  The preceding
canon had decreed different penalties for different kinds of <span
class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.4"></span>ἀλογευσάμενοι</span>.  But that
pronounced by canon xvii. being much severer than the <span
id="page_71">p. 71</span> <span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-Page_71"></span>preceding ones, the <span
class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.5"></span>ἀλογευσάμενοι</span> of this canon
must be greater sinners than those of the former one.  This greater
guilt cannot consist in the fact of a literal leprosy; for this malady
was not a consequence of bestiality.  But their sin was evidently
greater when they tempted others to commit it.  It is therefore <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.6"></span>λέπρα</span> in
the figurative sense that we are to understand, and our canon thus
means; “Those who were spiritually leprous through this sin, and
tempting others to commit it made them leprous.”
