&#8212;inasmuch as this was decreed in order that a bishop might not fall under censure by going to the Court&#8212;that if any have such petitions as we mentioned above, they should send these by one of their deacons.&#160; For the person of a subordinate does not excite jealousy, and what shall be granted [by the Emperor] can thus be reported more quickly.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iii.iv.viii-p12"></A>This decree is threefold.&#160; First, that the bishop in going to Court should not fall under suspicion either at Court or of his own people that he was approaching the Prince to obtain some cause of his own.&#160; Second, according to the interpretation of Zonaras, &#8220;that no one should be angry with the Minister or Deacon who tarried in camp, as the bishop had departed thence.&#8221;&#160; And third, that the Minister could carry away what he had asked for, that is (according to Zonaras), the letters of the Emperor pardoning the fault, or such like other matters.</p>
