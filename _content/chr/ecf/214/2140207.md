<span id="viii.vii.iii.xli-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xli-p2.1"></span>They</span> who are of the priesthood,
or of the clergy, shall not be magicians, enchanters, mathematicians, or
astrologers; nor shall they make what are called amulets, which are
chains for their own souls.  And those who wear such, we command to be
cast out of the Church.

id="viii.vii.iii.xli-p4.2"></span>Epitome</span> of <span
class="sc"><span id="viii.vii.iii.xli-p4.3"></span>Canon</span> XXXVI.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xli-p5"></span>Whoso will be priest must not be a
magician, nor one who uses incantations, or mathematical or astrological
charms, nor a putter on of amulets.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xli-p6"></span>Some interesting and valuable
information on charms will be found in Ducange (*Glossarium, s.v.*
Phylacterea).

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xli-p8"></span>“Magicians” are those who for any
purpose call Satan to their aid.  “Enchantors” are those who sing charms
or incantations, and through them draw demons to obey them. 
“Mathematicians” are they who hold the opinion that the celestial bodies
rule the universe, and that all earthly things are ruled by their
influence.  “Astrologers” are they who divine by the stars through the
agency of demons, and place their faith in them.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xli-p10"></span>Zonaras also notes that the
science of mathematics or astronomy is not at all hereby forbidden to
the clergy, but the excess and abuse of that science, which even more
easily may happen in the case of clergymen and consecrated persons than
in that of laymen.
