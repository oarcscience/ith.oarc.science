<p class="c31"><a name="xi.xvi-p3"></A>(Labbe and Cossart, <i>Concilia</i>, Tom. IV., col. 706.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xvi-p4"></A>The most glorious judges said:&#160; Since the proposition of the God-beloved archbishop of royal Constantinople, Anatolius, and of the most reverend bishop Paschasinus, holding the place of Leo, the most God-beloved archbishop of old Rome, which orders that because both of them [i.e., Bassianus and Stephen] acted uncanonically, neither of them should rule, nor be called bishop of the most holy church of Ephesus, and since the whole holy synod taught that uncanonically they had performed these ordinations, and had agreed with the speeches of the most reverend bishops; the most reverend Bassianus and the most reverend Stephen will be removed from the holy church of Ephesus; but they shall enjoy the episcopal dignity, and from the revenues of the before-mentioned most holy church, for their nourishment and consolation, they shall receive each year two hundred gold pieces; and another bishop shall be ordained according to the canons for the most holy church.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">288</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xi.xvi-p6"></A>And the whole holy synod cried out:&#160; This is a just sentence.&#160; This is a pious scheme.&#160; These things are fair to look upon.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xi.xvi-p7"></A>The most reverend bishop Bassianus said:&#160; Pray give order that what was stolen from me be restored.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xi.xvi-p8"></A>The most glorious judges said:&#160; If anything belonging to the most reverend bishop Bassianus personally has been taken from him, either by the most reverend bishop Stephen, or by any other persons whatsoever, this shall be restored, after judicial proof, by them who took it away or caused it to be taken.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="xi.xvi-p5"></A> The English translation of Hefele asserts twice (<i>Hist. of the Councils,</i> Vol. III., pp. 173 and 376), that Bassianus was &#8220;deposed.&#8221;&#160; This is entirely a mistake, he was deprived of his diocese, but retained his episcopal rank.</p>
