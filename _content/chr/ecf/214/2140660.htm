<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.cxxxvii-p5"></A>By our son Marcellus the subdeacon, I have received with all thanksgiving the writings of your holiness, praising the Lord that I enjoyed the blessing of so many of my brethren.&#160; O my lords and most blessed brethren, ye have written asking me to send you most accurate copies of the canons enacted at the city of Nice, the metropolis of Bithynia, by the Fathers for the exposition of the faith.&#160; And who is there that would deny to his brethren the common faith, or the statutes decreed by the Fathers.&#160; Wherefore by the same son of mine, Marcellus, your subdeacon, who was in great haste, I have sent to you the canons in full as they were adopted by the Fathers in the city of Nice; and I ask of you that your holy synod would have me much in your prayers.&#160; The subscription.&#160; May our God keep your sanctity, as we desire, most holy brethren.</p>
