<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xix-p7"></A>Some feasts ended at the ninth hour, others only in the evening, and both alike with prayer.&#160; The Synod here wills that in both cases the same prayers should be used.&#160; Thus does Van Espen explain the words of the text, and I think rightly.&#160; But the Greek commentator understands the Synod to order that the same prayers should be used in all places, thus excluding all individual caprice.&#160; According to this, the rule of conformity would refer to places; while, according to Van Espen, the nones and vespers were to be the same.&#160; If, however, this interpretation were correct, the Synod would not have only spoken of the prayers at nones and vespers, but would have said in general, &#8220;all dioceses shall use the same form of prayer.&#8221;</p>
