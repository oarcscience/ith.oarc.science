<span id="viii.vii.iii.lix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.lix-p2.1"></span>Members</span> of the priesthood and
of the clergy must not witness the plays at weddings or banquets; but,
before the players enter, they must rise and depart.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lix-p5"></span>Priests and clerics should leave

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lix-p7"></span>Christians are admonished to feast
modestly when they go to weddings and not to dance nor <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.vii.iii.lix-p7.1"></span>βαλλίζειν</span> ,
that is to clap their hands and make a noise with them.  For this is
unworthy of the Christian standing.  But consecrated persons must not
see the play at weddings, but before the *thymelici* begin, they must go
out.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lix-p8"></span>Compare with this Canons XXIV. and
LI., of the Synod in Trullo.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.lix-p9"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars III., *De Consecrat*. Dist.
v., can. xxxvij.
