<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlix-p7"></span>The discipline of this canon was
often renewed even in the Latin Church, and therefore Balsamon unjustly
attacks the Latins when he says; “Among the Latins women go without any
shame up to the altar whenever they wish.”  For the Latins have
forbidden and do forbid this approach of women to the altar no less than
the Greeks; and look upon the contrary custom as an abuse sprung of the
insolence of the women and of the negligence of bishops and pastors.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xlix-p9"></span>If it is prohibited to laymen to
enter the Sanctuary by the lxixth canon of the Sixth synod \[i.e.
Quinisext\], much more are women forbidden to do so who are unwillingly
indeed, but yet truly, polluted by the monthly flux of blood.
