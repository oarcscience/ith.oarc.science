<p class="c35"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p5"></A>A clergyman invited to a love feast shall carry nothing away with him; for this would bring his order into shame.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p7"></A>Van Espen translates:&#160; &#8220;no one holding any office in the Church, be he cleric or layman,&#8221; and appeals to the fact that already in early times among the Greeks many held offices in the Church without being ordained, as do now our sacristans and acolytes.&#160; I do not think, however, with Van Espen, that by &#8220;they of the priesthood&#8221; is meant in general any one holding office in the Church, but only the higher ranks of the clergy, priests and deacons, as in the preceding twenty-fourth canon the presbyters and deacons alone are expressly numbered among the <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p7.1"></A>&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> and distinguished from the other (minor) clerics.&#160; And afterwards, in canon XXX., there is a similar mention of three different grades, <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p7.2"></A>&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8055;</span>, <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p7.3"></A>&#954;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8055;</span>, and <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p7.4"></A>&#7936;&#963;&#954;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#8055;</span>.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p8"></A>The taking away of the remains of the <i>agape</i> is here forbidden, because, on the one hand, it showed covetousness, and, on the other, was perhaps considered a profanation.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p9"></A>This canon is found in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratian&#146;s <i>Decretum</i>, Pars I., Dist. XLII., c. iij.</p>
