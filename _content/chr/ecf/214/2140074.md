<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is not lawful for
Chorepiscopi to ordain presbyters or deacons, and most assuredly not
presbyters of a city, without the commission of the bishop given in
writing, in another parish.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XIII.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p5"></span>A chorepiscopus is not to ordain
without the consent of the bishop.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p6.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p7"></span>If the first part of the
thirteenth canon is easy to understand, the second, on the contrary,
presents a great difficulty; for a priest of a town could not in any
case have the power of consecrating priests and deacons, least of all in
a strange diocese.  Many of the most learned men have, for this reason,
supposed that the Greek text of the second half of the canon, as we have
read it, is incorrect or defective.  It wants, say they, <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p7.1"></span>ποιεῖν τι</span>,
or *aliquid agere, i.e., to complete a religious function*.  To confirm
this supposition, they have appealed to several ancient versions,
especially to that of Isidore:  *sed nec presbyteris civitatis sine
episcopi præcepto amplius aliquid imperare, vel sine auctoritate
literarum ejus in unaquaque* (some read <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p7.2"></span>ἐν ἐκάστῃ</span> instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p7.3"></span>ἐν ἑτέρᾳ</span>)
*parochia aliquid agere*.  The ancient Roman <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p7.4"></span>ms.</span> of the canons, *Codex
Canonum*, has the same <span id="page_69">p. 69</span> <span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-Page_69"></span>reading, only that it has
*provincia* instead of *parochia*.  Fulgentius Ferrandus, deacon of
Carthage, who long ago made a collection of canons, translates in the
same way in his *Breviatio Canonum*:  *Ut presbyteri civitatis sine
jussu episcopi nihil jubeant, nec in unaquaque parochia aliquid agant*. 
Van Espen has explained this canon in the same way.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8"></span>Routh has given another
interpretation.  He maintained that there was not a word missing in this
canon, but that at the commencement one ought to read, according to
several <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.1"></span>mss.</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.2"></span>χωρεπισκόποις</span> in the dative,
and further down <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.3"></span>ἀλλὰ μὴν μηδὲ</span> instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.4"></span>ἀλλα μηδὲ</span>
then <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.5"></span>πρεσβυτέρους</span> (in the
accusative) <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.6"></span>πόλεως</span> and finally <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.7"></span>ἐκάστῃ</span>
instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.8"></span>ἑτέρᾳ</span>, and that we must
therefore translate, “*Chorepiscopi* are not permitted to consecrate
priests and deacons (for the country) still less (<span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.9"></span>ἀλλὰ μὴν
μηδὲ</span>) can they consecrate priests for the town without the
consent of the bishop of the place.”  The Greek text, thus modified
according to some <span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.10"></span>mss.</span>, especially those in the
Bodleian Library, certainly gives a good meaning.  Still <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p8.11"></span>ἀλλὰ μὴν
μηδὲ</span> does not mean, *but still less*:  it means, *but certainly
not*, which makes a considerable difference.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xiii-p9"></span>Besides this, it can very seldom
have happened that the *chorepiscopi* ordained presbyters or deacons for
a town; and if so, they were already forbidden, at least implicitly, in
the first part of the canon.
