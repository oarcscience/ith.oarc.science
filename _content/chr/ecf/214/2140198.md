<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXVII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p2.1"></span>Neither</span> they of the
priesthood, nor clergymen, nor laymen, who are invited to a love feast,
may take away their portions, for this is to cast reproach on the
ecclesiastical order.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon
XXVII.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p5"></span>A clergyman invited to a love
feast shall carry nothing away with him; for this would bring his order
into shame.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p6.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p7"></span>Van Espen translates:  “no one
holding any office in the Church, be he cleric or layman,” and appeals
to the fact that already in early times among the Greeks many held
offices in the Church without being ordained, as do now our sacristans
and acolytes.  I do not think, however, with Van Espen, that by “they of
the priesthood” is meant in general any one holding office in the
Church, but only the higher ranks of the clergy, priests and deacons, as
in the preceding twenty-fourth canon the presbyters and deacons alone
are expressly numbered among the <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p7.1"></span>ἱερατικοῖς</span> and distinguished
from the other (minor) clerics.  And afterwards, in canon XXX., there is
a similar mention of three different grades, <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p7.2"></span>ἱερατικοί</span>, <span
class="Greek"><span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p7.3"></span>κληρικοί</span>,
and <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p7.4"></span>ἀσκηταί</span>.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p8"></span>The taking away of the remains
of the *agape* is here forbidden, because, on the one hand, it showed
covetousness, and, on the other, was perhaps considered a profanation.

<span id="viii.vii.iii.xxxii-p9"></span>This canon is found in the
*Corpus Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. XLII., c.
iij.
