<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.xv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.v.iv.xv-p2.1"></A>If</span> anyone shall forsake his own children and shall not nurture them, nor so far as in him lies, rear them in becoming piety, but shall neglect them, under pretence of asceticism, let him be anathema.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="viii.v.iv.xv-p5"></A>Whosoever they be that desert their children and do not instruct them in the fear of God let them be anathema.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.xv-p7"></A>The fathers of this Synod here teach that it is the office and duty of parents to provide for the bodily care of their children, and also, as far as in them lies, to mould them to the practice of piety.&#160; And this care for their children is to be preferred by parents to any private exercises of religion.&#160; In this connexion should be read the letter of St. Francis de Sales.&#160; (<i>Ep</i>. xxxii, Lib. 4.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.xv-p8"></A>It may perhaps be noted that this canon has not infrequently been violated by those who are accepted as Saints in the Church.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.v.iv.xv-p9"></A>This canon is found, in Isidore&#146;s version, in the <i>Corpus Juris Canonici</i>, Gratian&#146;s <i>Decretum</i>, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. xiv.</p>
