<span id="vii.vi.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>Canon III.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p2.1"></span>The</span> great Synod has stringently
forbidden any bishop, presbyter, deacon, or any one of the clergy
whatever, to have a *subintroducta* dwelling with him, except only a
mother, or sister, or aunt, or such persons only as are beyond all
suspicion.

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon III.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p5"></span>No one shall have a woman in his house
except his mother, and sister, and persons altogether beyond suspicion.

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p6.1"></span>Justellus.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p7"></span>Who these mulieres subintroductæ were
does not sufficiently appear…but they were neither wives nor concubines,
but women of some third kind, which the clergy kept with them, not for
the sake of offspring or lust, but from the desire, or certainly under
the pretence, of piety.

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p8"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p8.1"></span>Johnson.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p9"></span>For want of a proper English word to
render it by, I translate “to retain any woman in their houses under
pretence of her being a disciple to them.”

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p10"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p10.1"></span>Van Espen.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p11"></span>*Translates*:  And his sisters and aunts
cannot remain unless they be free from all suspicion.

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p12"></span>Fuchs in his *Bibliothek der kirchenver
sammlungen* confesses that this canon shews that the practice of
clerical celibacy had already spread widely.  In connexion with this
whole subject of the subintroductæ the text of St. Paul should be
carefully considered.  [1 Cor. ix.
5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005)<span id="vii.vi.iv-p12.1"></span>.

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p13"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p13.1"></span>Hefele.</span>

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p14"></span>It is very certain that the canon of
Nice forbids such spiritual unions, but the context shows moreover that
the Fathers had not these particular cases in view alone; and the
expression <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p14.1"></span>συνείσακτος</span> should be understood of
every woman who is *introduced* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p14.2"></span>συνείσακτος</span>) into the house of a
clergyman for the purpose of living there.  If by the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.iv-p14.3"></span>συνείσακτος</span> was
only intended the wife in this spiritual marriage, the Council would not
have said, any <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.vi.iv-p14.4"></span>συνείσακτος</span>, except his mother, etc.;
for neither his mother nor his sister could have formed this spiritual
union with the cleric.  The injunction, then, does net merely forbid the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.vi.iv-p14.5"></span>συνείσακτος</span>
in the specific sense, but orders that “no woman must live in the house
of a cleric, unless she be his mother,” etc.

<span id="vii.vi.iv-p15"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus Juris
Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Distinc. XXXII., C. xvj.
