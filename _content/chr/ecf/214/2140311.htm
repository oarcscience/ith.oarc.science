<p class="c31"><a name="xi.xi-p3"></A>(Labbe and Cossart, <i>Concilia</i>, Tom. IV., col. 469.)</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xi-p4"></A>The most magnificent and glorious judges and the great Senate said:</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xi.xi-p5"></A>Let the reverend council now declare what seems good concerning the faith, since those things which have already been disposed of have been made manifest.&#160; Paschasinus and Lucentius, the most reverend bishops, and Boniface the most reverend presbyter, legates of the Apostolic See through that most reverend man, bishop Paschasinus said:&#160; As the holy and blessed and Ecumenical Synod holds fast and follows the rule of faith (<i>fidei regulam</i> in the Latin Acts) which was set forth by the fathers at Nice, it also confirms the faith set forth by the Synod of 150 fathers gathered at Constantinople at the bidding of the great Theodosius of blessed memory.&#160; Moreover the exposition of their faith, of the illustrious Cyril of blessed memory set forth at the Council of Ephesus (in which Nestorius was condemned) is received.&#160; And in the third place the writings of that blessed man, Leo, Archbishop of all the churches, who condemned the heresy of Nestorius and Eutyches, shew what the true faith is.&#160; Likewise the holy Synod holds this faith, this it follows&#8212;nothing further can it add nor can it take aught away.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xi.xi-p6"></A>When this had been translated into Greek by Beronician, the devout secretary of the divine consistory, the most reverend bishops cried out:&#160; So we all believe, so we were baptized, so we baptize, so we have believed, so we now believe.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xi.xi-p7"></A>The most glorious judges and the great senate said:&#160; Since we see that the Holy Gospels have been placed alongside of your holiness, let each one of the bishops here assembled declare whether the epistle of most blessed archbishop Leo is in accordance with the exposition of the 318 fathers <A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A> <a name="xi.xi-Page_261"></A>assembled at Nice and with the decrees of the 150 fathers afterwards assembled in the royal city.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xi-p8"></A>[<i>To this question the bishops answered one by one, until 161 separate opinions had been given, when the rest of the bishops were asked by the imperial judges to give their votes in a body</i> (col. 508).]</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xi.xi-p9"></A>All the most reverend bishops cried out:&#160; We all acquiesce, we all believe thus; we are all of the same mind.&#160; So are we minded, so we believe, etc., etc.</p>
