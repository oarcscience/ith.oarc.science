id="viii.iv.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iv.iii.viii-p2.1"></span>If</span> the wife of a layman has
committed adultery and been clearly convicted, such \[a husband\] cannot
enter the ministry; and if she commit adultery after his ordination, he
must put her away; but if he retain her, he can have no part in the
ministry committed to him.

id="viii.iv.iii.viii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon VIII.</span>

<span id="viii.iv.iii.viii-p5"></span>A layman whose wife is an
adulteress cannot be a clergyman, and a cleric who keeps an adulteress
shall be expelled.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.viii-p7"></span>Although the Eastern Church allows
the clergy to have wives, even priests, and permits to them the use of
marriage after ordination, nevertheless it requires of them the highest
conjugal continency, as is seen by the present canon.  For here it is
evident that the Fathers wished even the smallest possible kind of
incontinence to be absent from men dedicated to holiness.

<span id="viii.iv.iii.viii-p8"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xxxiv., c. xi.
