<p class="c50"><a name="xv.iv.iv.vii-p2"></A>That the chrism should not be made by presbyters.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.vii-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.vii-p3.1"></A>Fortunatus</span> the bishop, said:&#160; In former councils we remember that it was decreed that the chrism or the reconciliation of penitents, as also the consecration of virgins be not done by presbyters:&#160; but should anyone be discovered to have done this, what ought we to decree with regard to him?</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xv.iv.iv.vii-p4"></A>Aurelius the bishop said:&#160; Your worthiness has heard the suggestion of our brother and fellow-bishop Fortunatus; What answer will you give?</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.vii-p8"></A>Let no presbyter make the chrism, nor prepare the unction, nor consecrate virgins, nor publicly reconcile anyone to communion.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.vii-p9"></A>This is Canon iij. of the Carthaginian Synod under Genethlius, <span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.vii-p9.1"></A>a.d.</span> 387 or 390.</p>

<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.vii-p11"></A>Not the chrism used upon persons at their baptism, says the scholion in Bishop Beveridge&#146;s <i>Annotation</i>, but the Mystical Chrism, viz., that used at Confirmation; though neither was the chrism used at baptism to be consecrated by Priests.&#160; See Decr. of Gelasius 6.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xv.iv.iv.vii-p12"></A>Du Pin observes, That this is one of the first monuments where the name of &#8220;mass&#8221; occurs to signify the public prayers, which the church made at offering the Eucharist.&#160; And let the reader observe, that there is no mention of the &#8220;mass&#8221; in the copies which the Greeks made use of.&#160; And further, he restrains the meaning of the word &#8220;mass&#8221; too much, when he supposes that it denoted the Communion Office only.</p>
