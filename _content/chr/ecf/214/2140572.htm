<p class="c50"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p2"></A>Of rebaptisms, reordinations, and translations of bishops.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p3.1"></A>But</span> we suggest that we decree what was set forth by the wisdom of the plenary synod at Capua, that no rebaptisings, nor reordinations should take place, and that bishops should not be translated.&#160; For Cresconius, bishop of Villa Regis, left his own people and invaded the Church of Tubinia and having been admonished down to this very day, to leave, according to the decree, the diocese he had invaded, he treated the admonition with disdain.&#160; We have heard that the sentence pronounced against him has been confirmed; but we seek, according to our decree, that ye deign to grant that being driven thereto by necessity, it be free to us to address the rector of the province against him, according to the statutes of the most glorious princes, so that whoever is not willing to acquiesce in the mild admonition of your holiness and to amend his lawlessness, shall be immediately cast out by judicial authority.&#160; Aurelius the bishop said:&#160; By the observance of the constituted form, let him not be judged to be a member of the synod, if he has been asked by you, dear brethren, to depart and has refused:&#160; for out of his own contempt and contumacy he has fallen to the power of the secular magistrate.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">450</FONT></A>
&#160; Honoratus and Urban the bishops said:&#160; This pleases us all, does it not?&#160; And all the bishops answered:&#160; It is just, it pleases us.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p7"></A>Let there be no rebaptisms, nor reordinations nor translations of bishops.&#160; Therefore let Cresconius be forbidden by judicial authority, for he has left his own people, and has taken possession of the diocese of Ceneum, although ecclesiastically admonished that he was not to change.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p8"></A>This canon is Canon j., of the Synod of Carthage of August 28th. <span class="sc"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xlix-p8.1"></A>a.d.</span> 397.&#160; The acts of this synod were first accurately edited by the Ballerini (in their edition of the works of St. Leo) and were printed by Mansi, in an amended form, in his <i>Concilia</i>.</p>
