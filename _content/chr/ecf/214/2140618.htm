 and letters were ordered to be sent for the purpose of directing the free legation:&#160; that became the unity had been made only at Carthage, letters should also be given to the judges, that they might order in the other provinces and cities the work of union to be proceeded with, and the thanksgivings of the Church of Carthage for the whole of Africa concerning the exclusion of the Donatists should be sent with the letters of the bishops to Court (<i>ad Comitatum</i>).</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="xv.iv.iv.xcv-p5"></A>The letters of Pope Innocent were read:&#160; that bishops ought not readily to carry causes across seas, and this very thing was confirmed by the judgment of the bishops themselves; that on account of thanksgiving and the exclusion of the Donatists, two clerics of the Church of Carthage should be sent to Court.</p>
