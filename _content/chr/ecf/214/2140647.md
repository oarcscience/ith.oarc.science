<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-Page_502"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p1.1"></span>Canon CXXIII.  (Greek cxxiv.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p2"></span>That if a bishop neglects his
diocese he is to be deprived of communion.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p3.1"></span>If</span> in the mother cathedrals a
bishop should have been negligent against the heretics, let a meeting be
held of the neighbouring diligent bishops, and let his negligence be
pointed out to him, so that he can have no excuse.  But if within six
months after this meeting, if an execution was in his own province, and
he had taken no care to convert them to Catholic unity, no one shall
communicate with him till he does his duty.  But if no executor shall
have come to the places, then the fault shall not be laid to the bishop.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon CXXIII.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p6"></span>A bishop who spurns the care of
heretics, and if after being warned he continues for six months in his
contempt, and has no care for their conversion, is to be excommunicated.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p7"></span>This is Canon xv. of Carthage, <span
class="sc"><span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 418.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p9"></span>So \[i.e. “Metropoles”\] I turn
matrices cathedræ.  I know indeed there were no fixed ecclesiastical
metropoles, in Africa; but they had civil metropoles called by that
name, can. 86, (89) which see.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxiv-p10"></span>Of these officers \[i.e. “Executors
“\] see can. 97 (100).
