<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxi-p2.1"></A>After</span> the sermons of the Bishops, the prayer for the catechumens is to be made first by itself; and after the catechumens have gone out, the prayer for those who are under penance; and, after these have passed under the hand [of the Bishop] and departed, there should then be offered the three prayers of the faithful, the first to be said entirely in silence, the second and third aloud, and then the [kiss of] peace is to be given.&#160; And, after the presbyters have given the [kiss of] peace to the Bishop, then the laity are to give it [to one another], and so the Holy Oblation is to be completed.&#160; And it is lawful to the priesthood alone to go to the Altar and [there] communicate.</p>

<p class="c35"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxi-p5"></A>After the prayers of the catechumens shall be said those of the Penitents, and afterwards those of the faithful.&#160; And after the peace, or embrace, has been given, the offering shall be made.&#160; Only priests shall enter the sanctuary and make there their communion.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.vii.iii.xxi-p6"></A>The Greek commentators throw but little if any light upon this canon.&#160; A question has been raised as to who said the prayers mentioned.&#160; Van Espen, following Isidore&#146;s translation &#8220;they also pray who are doing penance,&#8221; thinks the prayer of the penitents, said by themselves, is intended, and not the prayer said by the Bishop.&#160; But Hefele, following Dionysius&#146;s version&#8212;&#8220;the prayers over the catechumens,&#8221; &#8220;over those who are doing penance&#8221;&#8212;thinks that the liturgical prayers are intended, which after the sermon were wont to be said &#8220;over&#8221; the different classes.&#160; Dionysius does not say &#8220;over&#8221; the faithful, but describes them as &#8220;the prayers of the faithful,&#8221; which Hefele thinks means that the faithful joined in reciting them.</p>
