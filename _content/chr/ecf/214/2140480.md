<span id="xiv.iii.xcvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xiv.iii.xcvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XCVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xcvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xcvii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> who by baptism have put on
Christ have professed that they will copy his manner of life which he
led in the flesh.  Those therefore who adorn and arrange their hair to
the detriment of those who see them, that is by cunningly devised
intertwinings, and by this means put a bait in the way of unstable
souls, we take in hand to cure paternally with a suitable punishment: 
training them and teaching them to live soberly, in order that having
laid aside the deceit and vanity of material things, they may give their
minds continually to a life which is blessed and free from mischief, and
have their conversation in fear, pure, \[and holy <span
id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385) \]; and thus come as near as possible
to God through their purity of life; and adorn the inner man rather than
the outer, and that with virtues, and good and blameless manners, so
that they leave in themselves no remains of the left-handedness of the
adversary.  But if any shall act contrary to the present canon let him
be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.xcvii-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xcvii-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XCVI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xcvii-p6"></span>Whoever twist up their hair into
artistic plaits for the destruction of the beholders are to be cut off.

<span id="xiv.iii.xcvii-p7"></span>For the intricate manner of dressing
the hair used in the East, and for a description of the golden dye, see
the scholion of Zonaras.  Van Espen remarks that the curious care for
somebody else’s hair in the form of wigs, so prevalent with many laymen
and ecclesiastics of his day, is the same vice condemned by the canon in
another shape. <span id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386)

<span id="xiv.iii.xcvii-p3"></span> These words only in the Latin.

<span id="xiv.iii.xcvii-p8"></span> It is curious to note that so great
was the care of the clergy for their wigs that the very shape of the
vestments was changed so as not to disturb them, and the surplices were
slit all the way down the front, as they continue in some places even
down to our own days, after the original cause had long passed away.
