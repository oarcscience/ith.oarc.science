<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXI.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p2.1"></span>Concerning</span> women who commit
fornication, and destroy that which they have conceived, or who are
employed in making drugs for abortion, a former decree excluded them
until the hour of death, and to this some have assented.  Nevertheless,
being desirous to use somewhat greater lenity, we have ordained that
they fulfil ten years \[of penance\], according to the prescribed
degrees.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXI.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p5"></span>Harlots taking injurious
medicines are to be subjected to penance for ten years.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p6"></span>The phrase “and to this some have
assented” is the translation of Hervetus, Van Espen, and Hefele.  Dr.
Routh suggests to understand <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxii-p6.1"></span>ἁι</span> and translate, “the same
punishment will be inflicted on those who assist in causing
miscarriages,” but this seems rather an unnatural and strained rendering
of the Greek.
