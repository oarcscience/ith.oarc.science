<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-p1.1"></span>Canon CXX.  (Greek cxxi.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-p2"></span>Of those who intrude upon peoples
which they think belong to them, without the consent of those by whom
they are held.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-p3.1"></span>Item</span>, it seemed good that whatever
bishops seek the peoples whom they consider to pertain to their see, not
by bringing their causes before the episcopal judges, but rush in while
another is holding the place, all such, (whether said people are willing
to receive <span id="page_501">p. 501</span> <span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-Page_501"></span>them or no) shall lose their case. 
And whoever have done this, if the contention between the two bishops is
not yet finished but still going on, let him depart who intruded without
the decree of the ecclesiastical judges; nor let anyone flatter himself
that he will retain \[what he has seized\] if he shall obtain letters
from the primate, but whether he has such letters or has them not, it is
suitable that he who holds and receives his letters should make it
appear then that he has held the church pertaining to him peaceably. 
But if he has referred any question, let the cause be decided by the
episcopal judges, whether those whom the primates have appointed for
them, or the neighbouring bishops whom they have chosen by common
consent.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-p5"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-p5.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon CXX.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-p6"></span>Let no one seize for himself what he
thinks belongs to him:  but let the bishops judge or whom the Primate
will give, or whom the neighbouring bishops shall give with his
consent.  But whosoever has received letters from the primate concerning
the keeping \[of such regions and churches\] merely deceives himself.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-p7"></span>This is Canon xij. of Carthage, <span
class="sc"><span id="xv.iv.iv.cxxi-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 418.
