<span id="viii.iii.iii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.iv-p2.1"></span>Concerning</span> those who have been
forced to sacrifice, and who, in addition, have partaken of feasts in
honour of the idols; as many as were haled away, but afterwards went up
with a cheerful countenance, and wore their costliest apparel, and
partook with indifference of the feast provided; it is decreed that all
such be hearers for one year, and prostrators for three years, and that
they communicate in prayers only for two years, and then return to full
communion.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.iv-p5"></span>Such as have been led away and have
with joy gone up and eaten are to be in subjection for six years.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.iv-p6"></span>In the Greek the word for “full
communion” is <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.iv-p6.1"></span>τὸ τέλειον</span> (“the perfection”),
an expression frequently used by early writers to denote the Holy
Communion.  *Vide* Suicer, *Thesaurus ad h. v*.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.iv-p8"></span>\[The Holy Communion was so called
as being\] that sacred mystery which unites us to Christ, and gives us
the most consummate perfection that we are capable of in this world.
