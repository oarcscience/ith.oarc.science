<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>One</span> who had betrothed a
maiden, corrupted her sister, so that she conceived.  After that he
married his betrothed, but she who had been corrupted hanged herself. 
The parties to this affair were ordered to be received among the
co-standers after ten years \[of penance\] according to the prescribed
degrees.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome to Canon XXV.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p5"></span>A certain body after being
engaged to marry a young girl, violates her sister and then takes her to
wife.  The first is suffocated.  All who were cognizant of the affair
are to be subject to penance for ten years.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p6"></span>I have followed the usual
translation “hanged herself,” which is the ordinary dictionary-meaning
of <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>ἀπάγχω</span>, but Hefele says that
it signifies any and every variety of suicides.

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p7.1"></span>Balsamon.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii.xxvi-p8"></span>In this case we have many
nefarious crimes committed, fornication, unlawful marriage \[i.e. with
the sister of one’s mistress\] and murder.  In that case \[mentioned by
St. Basil in Canon lxxviij. where only seven years penance is enjoined\]
there is only a nefarious marriage \[i.e. with a wife’s sister\].
