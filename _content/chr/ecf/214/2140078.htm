<p class="c34"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p1"></A> <span class="c4"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p1.1"></A>Canon XVII.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p2.1"></A>Defilers</span> of themselves with beasts, being also leprous, who have infected others [with the leprosy of this crime], the holy Synod commands to pray among the hiemantes.</p>

<p class="c36"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p4"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p4.1"></A>Ancient Epitome of Canon XVII.</span></p> 
<p class="c35"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p5"></A>A leper who goes in to a beast or even to leprous women, shall pray with the hybernantes.</p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p6"></A><span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p6.1"></A>&#923;&#949;&#960;&#961;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;</span> is from <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p6.2"></A>&#955;&#949;&#960;&#961;&#8057;&#969;</span> not from <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p6.3"></A>&#955;&#949;&#960;&#961;&#8049;&#969;</span> and therefore cannot mean &#8220;have been lepers,&#8221; but &#8220;have made others rough and scabby.&#8221;&#160; It is only in the passive and in Alexandrian Greek that it has the meaning to become leprous.&#160; <i>Vide</i> Liddell and Scott.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p7"></A>There seems but little doubt that the word is to be understood spiritually as suggested above.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p8"></A>The last word of the canon is also a source of confusion.&#160; Both Beveridge and Routh understand by the <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p8.1"></A>&#967;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#950;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> those possessed with devils.&#160; Suicer however (<i>Thesaurus</i>) thinks that the penitents of the lowest degree are intended, who had no right to enter the church, but were exposed in the open porch to the inclemencies (<span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p8.2"></A>&#967;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#8061;&#957;</span>) of the weather.&#160; But, after all it matters little, as the possessed also were forced to remain in the same place, and shared the same name.</p> 
<p class="c19"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p9"></A>Besides the grammatical reason for the meaning of <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p9.1"></A>&#955;&#949;&#960;&#961;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;</span> given above there is another argument of Hefele&#146;s, as follows:</p> 
<p class="c36"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p10"></A><span class="sc"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p10.1"></A>Hefele.</span></p> 
<p class="c18"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11"></A>It is clear that <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.1"></A>&#955;&#949;&#960;&#961;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;</span> cannot possibly mean &#8220;those who have been lepers&#8221;; for there is no reason to be seen why those who were cured of that malady should have to remain outside the church among the flentes.&#160; Secondly, it is clear that the words <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.2"></A>&#955;&#949;&#960;&#961;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#8004;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962;</span>, etc. are added to give force to the expression <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.3"></A>&#7936;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#8049;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span>.&#160; The preceding canon had decreed different penalties for different kinds of <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.4"></A>&#7936;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#8049;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span>.&#160; But that pronounced by canon xvii. being much severer than the <A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A> <a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-Page_71"></A>preceding ones, the <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.5"></A>&#7936;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#8049;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> of this canon must be greater sinners than those of the former one.&#160; This greater guilt cannot consist in the fact of a literal leprosy; for this malady was not a consequence of bestiality.&#160; But their sin was evidently greater when they tempted others to commit it.&#160; It is therefore <span class="Greek"><a name="viii.iii.iii.xvii-p11.6"></A>&#955;&#8051;&#960;&#961;&#945;</span> in the figurative sense that we are to understand, and our canon thus means; &#8220;Those who were spiritually leprous through this sin, and tempting others to commit it made them leprous.&#8221;</p>
