<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XXVI.  (Greek xxix.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvii-p2"></span>*That no one should take from the
possessions of the Church.* <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvii-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xxvii-p4.1"></span>Likewise</span> it seemed good that no
one should sell anything belonging to the Church:  that if there was no
revenue, and other great necessity urged thereto, this might be brought
before the Metropolitan of the province that he might deliberate with
the appointed number of bishops whether this should be done:  that if
such urgent necessity lay upon any church that it could not take counsel
beforehand, at least let it call together the neighbouring bishops as
witnesses, taking care to refer all the necessities of his church to the
council:  and that if he shall not do this, he shall be held as
responsible toward God, and as a seller in the eye of the council, and
he shall have lost thereby his honour.

id="xv.iv.iv.xxvii-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XXVI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvii-p7"></span>Church goods must not be sold.  If
they bring in no revenue they may be sold at the will of the bishops. 
If the necessity does not allow that consultation should take place, he
who sells shall call together the neighbouring bishops.  If he does not
do so he shall be held responsible to God and to the Synod.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xxvii-p8"></span>This is Canon v. of the Synod of
Carthage, Sept. 13th, 401.
