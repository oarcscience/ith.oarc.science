<span id="xi.xviii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xi.xviii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Canon XVII.</span>

<span id="xi.xviii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xi.xviii.xvii-p2.1"></span>Outlying</span> or rural parishes shall
in every province remain subject to the bishops who now have
jurisdiction over them, particularly if the bishops have peaceably and
continuously governed them for the space of thirty years.  But if within
thirty years there has been, or is, any dispute concerning them, it is
lawful for those who hold themselves aggrieved to bring their cause
before the synod of the province.  And if any one be wronged by his
metropolitan, let the matter be decided by the exarch of the diocese or
by the throne of Constantinople, as aforesaid.  And if any city has
been, or shall hereafter be newly erected by imperial authority, let the
order of the ecclesiastical parishes follow the political and municipal
example.

<span id="xi.xviii.xvii-p5"></span>Village and rural parishes if they
have been possessed for thirty years, they shall so continue.  But if
within that time, the matter shall be subject to adjudication.  But if
by the command of the Emperor a city be renewed, the order of
ecclesiastical parishes shall follow the civil and public forms.

<span id="xi.xviii.xvii-p7"></span>The adjective <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.xviii.xvii-p7.1"></span>ἐγχωρίους</span> is
probably synonymous with <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xvii-p7.2"></span>ἀγροικικάς</span> (“rusticas,” *Prisca*),
although Dionysius and Isidorian take in as “situated on estates,” *cf*.
Routh, *Scr. Opusc*., ii., 109.  It was conceivable that some such
outlying districts might form, ecclesiastically, a border-land, it might
not be easy to assign them definitively to this or that bishopric.  In
such a case, says the Council, if the bishop who is now in possession of
these rural churches can show a prescription of thirty years in favour
of his see, let them remain undisturbed in his obedience.  (Here <span
class="Greek"><span id="xi.xviii.xvii-p7.3"></span>ἀβιάστως</span> may
be illustrated from <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xvii-p7.4"></span>βιασάμενος</span> in Eph. viij. and for
the use of <span class="Greek"><span
id="xi.xviii.xvii-p7.5"></span>οἰκονομεῖν</span> see I. Const., ij.) 
But the border-land might be the “debate-able” land:  the two neighbour
bishops might dispute as to the right to tend these “sheep in the
wilderness;” as we read in Cod. Afric., <span id="page_281">p.
281</span> <span id="xi.xviii.xvii-Page_281"></span>117, “multæ
controversiæ postea inter episcopos de diœcesibus ortæ sunt, et
oriuntur” (see on I. Const., ij.); as archbishop Thomas of York, and
Remigius of Dorchester, were at issue for years “with reference to
Lindsey” (Raine, *Fasti Eborac*., i. 150).  Accordingly, the canon
provides that if such a contest had arisen within the thirty years, or
should thereafter arise, the prelate who considered himself wronged
might appeal to the provincial synod.  If he should be aggrieved at the
decision of his metropolitan in synod, he might apply for redress to the
*eparch* (or prefect, a substitute for exarch) of the “diocese,” or to
the see of Constantinople (in the manner provided by canon ix.).  It is
curious “that in Russia all the sees are divided into eparchies of the
first, second, and third class” (Neale, *Essays on Liturgiology*, p.
302).

<span id="xi.xviii.xvii-p8"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars II., Causa XVI., Quæst.
iii., can. j., in Isidore Mercator’s version. <span
