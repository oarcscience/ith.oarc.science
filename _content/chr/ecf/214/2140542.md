<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p1.1"></span>Canon XVIII.  (Gk. xviii.  *The Latin
caption is the canon of the Greek*.)</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p2"></span>If any cleric is ordained he ought to
be admonished to observe the constitutions.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p3"></span>And that neither the Eucharist nor
Baptism should be given to the bodies of the dead.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p4"></span>And that every year in every province
the Metropolitans come together in synod.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p5"></span>(Gk. Canon xix.)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p6.1"></span>It</span> seemed good that before bishops,
or clerics were ordained, the provisions of the canons should be brought
to their notice, lest, they might afterwards repent of having through
ignorance acted contrary to law.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-Page_451"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p7.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Greek Canon XIX.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p8"></span>The things which have been adopted by
the synods should be made known to him who is to be ordained.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p9"></span>(Gk. Canon xx.)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p10"></span>It also seemed good that the
Eucharist should not be given to the bodies of the dead.  For it is
written:  “Take, Eat,” but the bodies of the dead can neither “take” nor
“eat.”  Nor let the ignorance of the presbyters baptize those who are
dead.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p11.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Greek Canon XX</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p12"></span>The Eucharist is not to be given to
the body of one dead for it neither eats nor drinks.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p13"></span>The ignorance of a presbyter shall
not baptize a dead man.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p14"></span>(Gk. Canon xxi.)

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p15"></span>And therefore in this holy synod
should be confirmed in accordance with the Nicene decrees, on account of
Ecclesiastical causes, which often are delayed to the injury of the
people, that every year there should be a synod, to which all, who are
primates of the provinces, should send bishops as legates, from their
own synods, two or as many as they choose; so that when the synod meets
it may have full power to act.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p16"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p16.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p17"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p17.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Greek Canon
XXI.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p18"></span>According to the decrees of the
Nicene Fathers a yearly synod shall be assembled, and two legates or as
many as they shall choose, shall be sent by the primates of every
province.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p19"></span>This is composed of Canons II., IV.,
and V. of the second series of enactments of Hippo, <span
class="sc"><span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p19.1"></span>a.d.</span> 393.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p20"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p20.1"></span>Johnson.</span>

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p21"></span>The 18th canon in the Edition of
Tilius and Bishop Beveridge runs thus; viz. \[If any clergyman be
ordained he ought to be reminded to keep the canons; and that the
Eucharist or Baptism be not given to dead corpses; and that the
Metropolitans in every province meet in synod yearly.\]  They speak
their own language, and call him a Metropolitan, whom the Africans
called a Primate; but then they have also the entire 18th canon, as it
here stands according to the Latin, which they divide into three, and
number them 19, 20, 21.

<span id="xv.iv.iv.xix-p22"></span>See Can. Nic. 5.  It seems very odd
that they should allege the authority of the Nicene Synod upon this
occasion; for that orders a synod twice a year, this but once; that
intends a provincial synod, this a diocesan or national one.
