<span id="xiv.iii.xlii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlii-p2.1"></span>Those</span> who in town or in villages
wish to go away into cloisters, and take heed for themselves apart,
before they enter a monastery and practise the anchorite’s life, <span
id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369) should for the space of three years in
the fear of God submit to the Superior of the house, and fulfil
obedience in all things, as is right, thus shewing forth their choice of
this life and that they embrace it willingly and with their whole
hearts; they are then to be examined by the superior (<span
class="Greek"><span id="xiv.iii.xlii-p3.1"></span>προέδρος</span>) of
the place; and then to bear bravely outside the cloister one year more,
so that their purpose may be fully manifested.  For by this they will
shew fully and perfectly that they are not catching at vain glory, but
that they are pursuing the life of solitude because of its inherent
beauty and honour.  After the completion of such a period, if they
remain in the same intention in their choice of the life, they are to be
enclosed, and no longer is it lawful for them to go out of such a house
when they so desire, unless they be induced to do so for the common
advantage, or other pressing necessity urging on to death; and then only
with the blessing of the bishop of that place.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlii-p4"></span>And those who, without the
above-mentioned causes, venture forth of their convents, are first of
all to be shut up in the said convent even against their wills, and then
are to cure themselves with fasting and other afflictions, knowing how
it is written that “no one who has put his hand to the plough and has
looked back, is fit for the kingdom of heaven.”

<span id="xiv.iii.xlii-p6"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="xiv.iii.xlii-p6.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon XLI.</span>

<span id="xiv.iii.xlii-p7"></span>Whoever is about to enter a cloister,
let him live for three years in a monastery, and before he is shut up
let him spend one year more, and so let him be shut up.  And he shall
not then go forth unless death or the common good demands.

<span id="xiv.iii.xlii-p9"></span>This canon, so far as it sets forth
the necessity of probation before admission to the Anchorite life,
synods in after-years frequently approved, taught as they were by
experience how perilous a matter it is to admit without sufficient
probation to this solitary life and state of separation from the common
intercourse with his fellow men.  *Vide* the Synod of Vannes (about
<span class="sc"><span id="xiv.iii.xlii-p9.1"></span>a.d.</span> 465)
canon vij., of Agde chap. lxxviij., of Orleans the First can. xxij., of
Frankfort can. xij., of Toledo the Seventh can. v., and the *Capitular*
of Charlemagne *To monks*, Chap. ij.
