<span id="viii.v.iv.x"></span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="viii.v.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Canon X.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.x-p2.1"></span>If</span> any one of those who are living a
virgin life for the Lord’s sake shall treat arrogantly the married, let
him be anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="viii.v.iv.x-p3.1"></span>Notes.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p4"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.x-p4.1"></span>Ancient Epitome of Canon X.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p5"></span>Whoso treats arrogantly those joined in
matrimony, let him be anathema.

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p6"></span>On this point the fathers had spoken
long before, I cite two as examples.

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p7"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.x-p7.1"></span>St. Clement.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p8"></span>(Epist. I., 38, Lightfoot’s
translation.)

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p9"></span>So in our case let the whole body be
saved in Christ Jesus, and let each man be subject unto his neighbour,
according as also he was appointed with his special grace.  Let not the
strong neglect the weak; and let the weak respect the strong.  Let the
rich minister aid to the poor and let the poor give thanks to God,
because he hath given him one through whom his wants may be supplied. 
Let the wise display his wisdom, not in words, but in good works.  He
that is lowly in mind, let him not bear testimony to himself, but leave
testimony to be borne to him by his neighbour.  He that is pure in the
flesh, let him be so, <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157) and not
boast, knowing that it is Another who bestoweth his continence upon
him.  Let us consider, brethren, of what matter we were made; who and
what manner of beings we were, when we came into the world; from what a
sepulchre and what darkness he that moulded and created us brought us
into his world, having prepared his benefits aforehand ere ever we were
born.  Seeing therefore that we have all these things from him, we ought
in all things to give thanks to him, to whom be the glory for ever and
ever.  Amen.

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p11"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="viii.v.iv.x-p11.1"></span>St. Ignatius.</span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p12"></span>(Epist. ad Polyc. 5, Lightfoot’s
translation.)

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p13"></span>Flee evil arts, or rather hold thou
discourse about these, Tell my sisters to love the Lord and to be
content with their husbands in flesh and in spirit.  In like manner also
charge my brothers in the name of Jesus Christ to love their wives, as
the Lord loved the Church.  If anyone is able to abide in chastity to
the honour of the flesh of the Lord, let him so abide without boasting. 
If he boast, he is lost; and if it be known beyond the bishop, he is
polluted.  It becometh men and women, too, when they marry to unite
themselves with the consent of the bishop, that the marriage may be
after the Lord and not after concupiscence.  Let all things be done to
the honour of God.

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p14"></span>This canon is found in the *Corpus
Juris Canonici*, Gratian’s *Decretum*, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. iv.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_157"></span>[96:158](2140121.htm#fr_157) <span
id="viii.v.iv.x-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v.iv.x-p10"></span> Lightfoot adopts Laurents’ emendation
and reads <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.v.iv.x-p10.1"></span>ήτω</span>.  <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.v.iv.x-p10.2"></span>Σιγάτω</span> has also been suggested and
Hort’s thinks <span class="Greek"><span
id="viii.v.iv.x-p10.3"></span>στήτω</span> to be the genuine reading. 
It all comes to the same thing, however, the meaning being perfectly
clear.
