id="vii.xv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.</span>

<span id="vii.xv.xi-p2"></span>And when Jesus was scourged, he delivered
Him to the Jews to be crucified, and two robbers with Him; one by name
Dismas, and the other by name Gestas.  And when they came to the place,
they stripped Him of His garments, and girt Him about with a linen
cloth, and put a crown of thorns upon His head.  Likewise also they
hanged the two robbers with Him, Dismas on the right and Gestas on the
left.  And Jesus said:  Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do.  And the soldiers parted His garments among them.  And the
people stood waiting; and their chief priests and judges mocked Him,
saying among themselves:  He saved others, now let him save himself; if
he is the Son of God, let him come down from the cross.  And the
soldiers mocked Him, falling prostrate <span
id="fr_1961"></span>[1962](#fn_1961) before Him, and offering vinegar
with gall, and saying:  If thou art the King of the Jews, set thyself
free.

<span id="vii.xv.xi-p4"></span>And Pilate, after sentence, ordered a
title to be written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin letters, according to
what the Jews said:  This is the King of the Jews.

<span id="vii.xv.xi-p5"></span>And one of the robbers *who were* hanged,
by name Gestas, said to Him:  If thou art the Christ, free thyself and
us.  And Dismas answering, rebuked him, saying:  Dost not even thou fear
God, who art in this condemnation? for we justly and deservedly have
received those things which we endure; but He has done no evil.  And he
kept saying to Jesus:  Remember me, Lord, in Thy kingdom.  And Jesus
said to him:  Verily I say unto thee, that to-day shalt thou be with me
in paradise.
