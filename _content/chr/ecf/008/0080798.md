id="vi.iv.viii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—“All Uncleanness with
Greediness.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xi-p2"></span>“‘But let all doors be opened to him,
and let all baneful and arbitrary laws be set aside, which have been
ordained by fanatical men, who, under the power of senselessness, and
not willing to understand what is reasonable, and, moreover, suspecting
those who are called adulterers, are with good reason mocked with
arbitrary laws by Zeus himself, through Minos and Rhadamanthus.  For
there is no restraining of Eros dwelling in our souls; for the passion
of lovers is not voluntary.  Therefore Zeus himself, the giver of these
laws, approached myriads of women; and, according to some wise men, he
sometimes had intercourse with human beings, as a benefactor for the
production of children.  But in the case of those to whom he knew that
his being unknown would be a favour, <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047) he changed his form, in order that
he might neither grieve them, nor seem to act in opposition to the laws
given by himself.  It becomes you, therefore, who are debaters of
philosophy, for the sake of a good life, to imitate those who are
acknowledged to be the nobler, who have had sexual intercourse ten
thousand times.
