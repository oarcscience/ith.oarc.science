<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xiv-p2"></A>But it plainly appeared to me that he was disconcerted.&#160; For when I said to him, &#8220;Only set forth to me the words which you have heard of the Man who has appeared, and I will adorn them with my speech, and preach the counsel of God; and if you do so, within a few days I will sail with you, for I greatly desire to go to the land of Jud&aelig;a, and perhaps I shall dwell with you all my life;&#8221;&#8212;when he heard this, he answered:&#160; &#8220;If you wish to inquire into our affairs, and to learn what is for your advantage, sail with me at once.&#160; But if you will not, I shall now give you directions to my house, and that of those whom you wish <i>to meet</i>, that when you choose to come you may find us.&#160; For I shall set out to-morrow for my home.&#8221;&#160; And when I saw that he could not be prevailed upon, I went with him as far as the harbour; and having learned of him the directions which he had promised to give me for finding the dwellings, I said to him, &#8220;Were it not that to-morrow I am to recover a debt that is due to me, I should straightway set sail with you.&#160; But I shall soon overtake you.&#8221;&#160; And having said this, and having given him in charge to those who commanded the ship, I returned grieving, remembering him as an excellent and dear friend.</p>
