<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxix-p2"></A>&#8220;But I shall give a still stronger proof of the matters in hand.&#160; For, behold, scarcely seven years have yet passed since the advent of the righteous and true Prophet; and in the course of these, men of all nations coming to Jud&aelig;a, and moved both by the signs and miracles which they saw, and by the grandeur of His doctrine, received His faith; and then going back to their own countries, they rejected the lawless rites of the Gentiles, and their incestuous marriages.&#160; In short, among the Parthians&#8212;as Thomas, who is preaching the Gospel amongst them, has written to us&#8212;not many now are addicted to polygamy; nor among the Medes do many throw their dead to dogs; nor are the Persians pleased with intercourse with their mothers, or incestuous marriages with their daughters; nor do the Susian women practise the adulteries that were allowed them; nor has <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxix-p2.1"></A>Genesis</span> been able to force those into crimes whom the teaching of religion restrained.</p>
