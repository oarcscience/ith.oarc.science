<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.viii.vii-p2"></A>&#8220;Then Appion said:&#160; &#145;Do you not think it is the same thing, whether you obtain her by magic, or by deceiving her with words?&#146;&#160; Then said I:&#160; &#145;Not altogether the same; for these differ widely from one another.&#160; For he who constrains an unwilling woman by the force of magic, subjects himself to the most terrible punishment, as having plotted against a chaste woman; but he who persuades her with words, and puts the choice in her own power and will, does not force her.&#160; And I am of opinion, that he who has persuaded <i>a woman</i> will not suffer so great punishment as he who has forced her.&#160; Therefore, if you can persuade her, I shall be thankful to you when I have obtained her; but otherwise, I had rather die than force her against her will.&#146;</p>
