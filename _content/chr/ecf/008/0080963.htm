<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxix-p2"></A>&#8220;Therefore He made use of this memorable expression, speaking the truth with respect to the hypocrites of them, not with respect to all.&#160; For to some He said that obedience was to be rendered, because they were entrusted with the chair of Moses.&#160; However, to the hypocrites he said, &#145;Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye make clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but the inside is full of filth.&#160; Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and the platter, that their outsides may be clean also.&#146;&#160; And truly:&#160; for when the mind is enlightened by knowledge, the disciple is able to be good, and thereupon purity follows; for from the understanding within a good care of the body without is produced.&#160; As from negligence with respect to the body, care of the understanding cannot be produced, so the pure man can purify both that which is without and that which is within.&#160; And he who, purifying the things without, does it looking to the praise of men, and by the praise of those who look on, he has nothing from God.</p>
