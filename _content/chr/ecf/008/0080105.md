Gospel.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xliii-p2"></span>“Nevertheless, the truth
everywhere prevailed; for, in proof that these things were done by
divine power, we who had been very few became in the course of a few
days, by the help of God, far more than they.  So that the priests at
one time were afraid, lest haply, by the providence of God, to their
confusion, the whole of the people should come over to our faith. 
Therefore they often sent to us, and asked us to discourse to them
concerning Jesus, whether He were the Prophet whom Moses foretold, who
is the eternal Christ. <span id="fr_573"></span>[574](#fn_573)   For on
this point only does there seem to be any difference between us who
believe in Jesus, and the unbelieving Jews.  But while they often made
such requests to us, and we sought for a fitting opportunity, a week of
years was completed from the passion of the Lord, the Church of the Lord
which was constituted in Jerusalem was most plentifully multiplied and
grew, being governed with most righteous ordinances by James, who was
ordained bishop in it by the Lord.”
