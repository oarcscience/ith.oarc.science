<p class="c35"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p1.1"></A>Chapter XIX.&#8212;Some Actions Really Wicked.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xix-p2"></A>And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;A man ought to punish himself through self-restraint,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1449"></A><A HREF="#fn_1449"><FONT SIZE="1">1450</FONT></A>
 when his lust wishes to hurry on to the injury of another, knowing <i>that</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1450"></A><A HREF="#fn_1450"><FONT SIZE="1">1451</FONT></A>
the wicked one can destroy the wicked, for he has received power over them from the beginning.&#160; And not yet is this an evil to those who have done evil; but that their souls should remain punished after the destruction, you are right in thinking to be really harsh, though the man who has been fore-ordained for evil should say that it is right.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1451"></A><A HREF="#fn_1451"><FONT SIZE="1">1452</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore, as I said, we ought to avoid doing injury&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1452"></A><A HREF="#fn_1452"><FONT SIZE="1">1453</FONT></A>
 to another for the sake of a short lived pleasure, that we may not involve ourselves in eternal punishment for the sake of a little pleasure.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Is it the case, then, that there is nothing either bad or good by nature, but the difference arises through law and custom?&#160; <i>For is it not</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1453"></A><A HREF="#fn_1453"><FONT SIZE="1">1454</FONT></A>
 the habit of the Persians to marry their own mothers, sisters and daughters, while marriage with other women is prohibited&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1454"></A><A HREF="#fn_1454"><FONT SIZE="1">1455</FONT></A>
 as most barbarous?&#160; Wherefore, if it is not settled what things are evil, it is not possible for all to look forward to the judgment of God.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;This cannot hold; for it is plain to all that cohabitation with mothers is abominable, even though the Persians, who are a mere fraction of the whole, should under the effects of a bad custom fail to see the iniquity of their abominable conduct.&#160; Thus also the Britons publicly cohabit in the sight of all, and are not ashamed; and some men eat the flesh of others, and feel no disgust; and others eat the flesh of dogs; and others practice other unmentionable deeds.&#160; Thus, then we ought not to form our judgments with a perception which through habit has been perverted from its natural action.&#160; For to be murdered is an evil, even if all were to deny it; for no one wishes to suffer it himself, and in the case of theft&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1455"></A><A HREF="#fn_1455"><FONT SIZE="1">1456</FONT></A>
 no one rejoices at his own punishment.&#160; If, then, no one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1456"></A><A HREF="#fn_1456"><FONT SIZE="1">1457</FONT></A>
 were at all ever to confess that these are sins, it is right even then to look forward of necessity to a judgment in regard to sins.&#8221;&#160; When Peter said this, Simon answered:&#160; &#8220;Does this, then, seem to you to be the truth in regard to the wicked one?&#160; Tell me.&#8221;</p>
