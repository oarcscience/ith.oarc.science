<span id="ix.xiii.iv-p3"></span>Abgar returns from the east; he gives
help to Aretas in a war against Herod the Tetrarch.

<span id="ix.xiii.iv-p4"></span>When Abgar had returned from the East,
he learnt that the Romans suspected him of having gone there to raise
troops.  He therefore made the Roman commissioners acquainted with the
reasons of his journey to Persia, as well as the treaty concluded
between Ardachès and his brothers; but no credence was given to his
statement:  for he was accused by his enemies Pilate, Herod the
tetrarch, Lysanias and Philip.  Abgar having returned to his city Edessa
leagued himself with Aretas, king of Petra, and gave him some auxiliary
troops under the command of Khosran Ardzrouni, to make war upon Herod. 
Herod had in the first instance married the daughter of Aretas, then had
repudiated her, and thereupon taken Herodias, even in her husband’s
lifetime, a circumstance in connection with which he had had John the
Baptist put to death.  Consequently there was war between Herod and
Aretas on account of the wrong done the daughter of Aretas.  Being
sharply attacked, Herod’s troops were defeated, thanks to the help of
the brave Armenians; as if, by divine providence, vengeance was taken
for the death of John the Baptist.
