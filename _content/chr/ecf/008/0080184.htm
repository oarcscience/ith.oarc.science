<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xlvii-p2"></A>To this Simon replied:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_657"></A><A HREF="#fn_657"><FONT SIZE="1">658</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;From the words of your master I shall refute you, because even he introduces to all men a certain God who was known.&#160; For although both Adam knew the God who was his creator, and the maker of the world; and Enoch knew him, inasmuch as he was translated by him; and Noah, since he was ordered by him to construct the ark; and although Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, and all, even every people and all nations, know the maker of the world, and confess him to be a God, yet your Jesus, who appeared long after the patriarchs, says:&#160; &#145;No one knows the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any one the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son has been pleased to reveal Him.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_658"></A><A HREF="#fn_658"><FONT SIZE="1">659</FONT></A>
&#160; Thus, therefore, even your Jesus confesses that there is another God, incomprehensible and unknown to all.&#8221;</p>
