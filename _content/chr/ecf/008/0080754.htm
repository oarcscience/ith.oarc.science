<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lxvii-p2"></A>&#8220;It is necessary, therefore, that the Church, as a city built upon a hill, have an order approved of God, and good government.&#160; In particular, let the bishop, as chief, be heard in the things which he speaks; and let the elders give heed that the things ordered be done.&#160; Let the deacons, going about, look after the bodies and the souls of the brethren, and report to the bishop.&#160; Let all the rest of the brethren bear wrong patiently; but if they wish judgment to be given concerning wrongs done to them, let them be reconciled in presence of the elders; and let the elders report the reconciliation to the bishop.</p>
