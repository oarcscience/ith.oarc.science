<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xi-p2"></A>And Simon, hearing this, said: &#160;&#8220;You will not force me through shame to remain silent in regard to His substance, and to inquire into His will alone.&#160; For it is possible both to think and to speak of His substance.&#160; I mean from the good attributes that belong to man.&#160; For instance, life and death are attributes of man; but death is not an attribute of God, but life, and eternal life.&#160; Furthermore, men may be both evil and good; but God can be only incomparably good.&#160; And, not to prolong the subject too much, the better attributes of man are eternal attributes of God.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Tell me, Simon, is it an attribute of man to beget evil and good, and to do evil and good?&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;It is.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Since you made this assertion, we must assign the better attributes of man to God; and so, while men beget evil and good, God can beget good only; and while men do evil and good, God rejoices only in doing good.&#160; Thus, with regard <A NAME="page_334"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 334</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xxii.xi-Page_334"></A><i>to God</i>, we must either not predicate any of the attributes of man and be silent, or it is reasonable that we should assign the best of the good attributes to Him.&#160; And thus He alone is the cause of all good things.&#8221;</p>
