<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.iv-p2"></A>But Bernice, being asked, said:&#160; &#8220;These things are indeed as you have heard; and I will tell you other things respecting this same Simon, which perhaps you do not know.&#160; For he astonishes the whole city every day, by making spectres and ghosts appear in the midst of the market-place; and when he walks abroad, statues move, and many shadows go before him, which, he says, are souls of the dead.&#160; And many who attempted to prove him an impostor he speedily reconciled to him; and afterwards, under pretence of a banquet, having slain an ox, and given them to eat of it, he infected them with various diseases, and subjected them to demons.&#160; And in a word, having injured many, and being supposed to be a god, he is both feared and honoured.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1030"></A><A HREF="#fn_1030"><FONT SIZE="1">1031</FONT></A>
