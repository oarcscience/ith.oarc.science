<span id="vii.v.xx-p2"></span>Lions and panthers adored Him likewise,
and accompanied them in the desert.  Wherever Joseph and the blessed
Mary went, they went before them showing them the way, and bowing their
heads; and showing their submission by wagging their tails, they adored
Him with great reverence.  Now at first, when Mary saw the lions and the
panthers, and various kinds of wild beasts, coming about them, she was
very much afraid.  But the infant Jesus looked into her face with a
joyful countenance, and said:  Be not afraid, mother; for they come not
to do thee harm, but they make haste to serve both thee and me.  With
these words He drove all fear from her heart.  And the lions kept
walking with them, and with the oxen, and the asses, and the beasts of
burden which carried their baggage, and did not hurt a single one of
them, though they kept beside them; but they were tame among the sheep
and the rams which they had brought with them from Judæa, and which they
had with them.  They walked among wolves, and feared nothing; and no one
of them was hurt by another.  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken
by the prophet:  Wolves shall feed with lambs; the lion and the ox shall
eat straw together. <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661)   There
were together two oxen drawing a waggon with provision for the journey,
and the lions directed them in their path.
