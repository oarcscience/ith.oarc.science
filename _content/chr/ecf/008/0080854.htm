<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.x.ix-p2"></A>No sooner had he reached Beyrout than an earthquake took place; and the multitude, running to Peter, said, &#8220;Help us, for we are afraid we shall all utterly perish.&#8221;&#160; Then Simon ventured, along with Appion and Anubion and Athenodorus, and the rest of his companions, to cry out to the people against Peter in public:&#160; &#8220;Flee, friends, from this man! he is a magician; trust us, he it was who caused this earthquake: he sent us these diseases to terrify us, as if he were God Himself.&#8221;&#160; And many such false charges did Simon and his friends bring against Peter, as one who could do things above human power.&#160; But as soon as the people gave him a moment&#146;s quiet, Peter with surprising boldness gave a little laugh, and said, &#8220;Friends, I admit that I can do, God willing, what these men say; and more than that, I am ready, if you do not believe what I say, to overturn your city from top to bottom.&#8221;</p>
