id="vi.iii.viii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—How the Fight Begins.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.v-p2"></span>“But if any one say, How does it seem
right for men to be separated from their parents? I will tell you how. 
Because, if they remained with them in error, they would do no good to
them, and they would themselves perish with them.  It is therefore
right, and very right, that he who will be saved be separated from him
who will not.  But observe this also, that this separa<span
id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span
id="vi.iii.viii.v-Page_154"></span>tion does not come from those who
understand aright; for they wish to be with their relatives, and to do
them good, and to teach them better things.  But it is the vice peculiar
to ignorance, that it will not bear to have near it the light of truth,
which confutes it; and therefore that separation originates with them. 
For those who receive the knowledge of the truth, because it is full of
goodness, desire, if it be possible, to share it with all, as given by
the good God; yea, even with those who hate and persecute them:  for
they know that ignorance is the cause of their sin.  Wherefore, in
short, the Master Himself, when He was being led to the cross by those
who knew Him not, prayed the Father for His murderers, and said,
‘Father, forgive their sin, for they know not what they do!’ <span
id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779)   The disciples also, in imitation of
the Master, even when themselves were suffering, in like manner prayed
for their murderers. <span id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780)   But if we
are taught to pray even for our murderers and persecutors, how ought we
not to bear the persecutions of parents and relations, and to pray for
their conversion?
