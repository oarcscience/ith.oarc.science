<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Why the Wicked One is
Entrusted with Power.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xvi-p2"></span>And Simon said to this:  “I have one
thing more to say in regard to the wicked one.  Assuredly, since God
made him out of nothing, he is in this respect wicked, <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440) especially since he was able to
make him good, by giving him at his creation a nature in no way capable
of selecting wickedness.”  And Peter said:  “The statement that He
created him out of nothing, with a power of choice, is like the
statement we have made above, that, having made such a constitution as
can rejoice in evils, He Himself appears to be the cause of what took
place.  But since there is one explanation of both statements, we shall
show afterwards why it was that He made him rejoice in the destruction
of the wicked.”  And Simon said:  “If he made the angels also voluntary
agents, and the wicked one departed from a state of righteousness, why
has he been honoured with a post of command?  Is it not plain that he
who thus honoured him takes pleasure in the wicked, in that he has thus
honoured him?” <span id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441)   And Peter
said:  “If God set him by law, when he rebelled, to rule over those who
were like him, ordering him to inflict punishment on those who sin, He
is not unjust.  But if it be the case that He has honoured him even
after his revolt, He who honoured him saw beforehand his usefulness; for
the honour is temporary, and it is right that the wicked should be ruled
by the wicked one, and that sinners should be punished by him.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xvi-p3"></span> The <span class="c9"><span

who made him is wicked, who gave existence to what was non-existent.”
