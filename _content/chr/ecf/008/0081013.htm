<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.viii-p2"></A>&#8220;We were brought up along with one Simon, a magician; and in consequence of our friendly intercourse with him, we were in danger of being <A NAME="page_302"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 302</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xvi.viii-Page_302"></A>led astray.&#160; Now there is a report in regard to some man, that, when he appears, the mass of those who have been pious are to live free from death and pain in his kingdom.&#160; This matter, however, mother, will be explained more fully at the proper time.&#160; But when we were going to be led astray by Simon, a friend of our lord Peter, by name Zacch&aelig;us, came to us and warned us not to be led astray by the magician; and when Peter came, he brought us to him that he might give us full information, and convince us in regard to those matters that related to piety.&#160; Wherefore we beseech you, mother, to partake of those blessings which have been vouchsafed to us, that we may unite around the same table!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1167"></A><A HREF="#fn_1167"><FONT SIZE="1">1168</FONT></A>
&#160; This, then, is the reason, mother, why you thought we were dead.&#160; On that disastrous night we had been taken up in the sea by pirates, but you supposed that we had perished.&#8221;</p>
