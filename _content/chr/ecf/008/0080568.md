<span id="vi.iii.xii.lx-p2"></span>Then Peter, moved with compassion,
promised that he would restore the face of our father, saying to him: 
“Listen, Faustinianus:  As soon as the error of your transformed
countenance shall have conferred some advantage on us, and <span
id="page_208">p. 208</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xii.lx-Page_208"></span>shall have subserved the designs
which we have in view, then I shall restore to you the true form of your
countenance; on condition, however, that you first despatch what I shall
command you.”  And when my father promised that he would with all his
might fulfil everything that he might charge him with, provided only
that he might recover his own countenance, Peter thus began:  “You have
heard with your own ears, that one of those who had been sent before has
returned from Antioch, and told us how Simon, while he was there,
stirred up the multitudes against me, and inflamed the whole city into
hatred of me, declaring that I am a magician, and a murderer, and a
deceiver, so that they are eager, if they see me, even to eat my flesh.
 Do therefore what I tell you:  leave Clement with me, and go before us
to Antioch, with your wife, and your sons Faustus and Faustinus.  And I
shall also send others with you, whom I think fit, who shall observe
whatsoever I command them.
