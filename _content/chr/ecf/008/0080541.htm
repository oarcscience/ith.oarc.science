<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xxxiii-p2"></A>&#8220;Now this Jupiter the Greeks would have to be called from his living, or giving life, but our people from his giving succour.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_871"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">872</FONT></A>
&#160; They say, therefore, that this is the living substance, which, placed in the upper regions, and drawing all things to itself by the influence of heat, as by the convolution of the brain, and arranging them by the moderation of a certain tempering, is said from his head to have produced wisdom, whom they call Minerva, who was called <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xxxiii-p3.1"></A>&#8125;&#913;&#952;&#8053;&#957;&#951;</span> by the Greeks on account of her immortality; who, because the father of all created all things by his wisdom, is also said to have been produced from his head, and from the principal place of all, and is represented as having formed and adorned the whole world by the regulated admixture of the elements.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_872"></A><A HREF="#fn_872"><FONT SIZE="1">873</FONT></A>
&#160; Therefore the forms which were impressed upon matter, that the world might be made, because they are constrained by the force of heat, are said to be held together by the energy of Jupiter.&#160; And since there are enough of these, and they do not need anything new to be added to them, but each thing is repaired by the produce of its own seed, the hands of Saturn are said to be bound by Jupiter; because, as I have said, time now produces from matter nothing new:&#160; but the warmth of seeds restores all things according to their kinds; and no birth of Rhea&#8212;that is, no increase of flowing matter&#8212;ascends further.&#160; And therefore they call that first division of the elements the mutilation of Saturn, because he cannot any more produce a world.</p>
