<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xvi-p2"></A>And Simon said to this:&#160; &#8220;I have one thing more to say in regard to the wicked one.&#160; Assuredly, since God made him out of nothing, he is in this respect wicked,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1440"></A><A HREF="#fn_1440"><FONT SIZE="1">1441</FONT></A>
 especially since he was able to make him good, by giving him at his creation a nature in no way capable of selecting wickedness.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;The statement that He created him out of nothing, with a power of choice, is like the statement we have made above, that, having made such a constitution as can rejoice in evils, He Himself appears to be the cause of what took place.&#160; But since there is one explanation of both statements, we shall show afterwards why it was that He made him rejoice in the destruction of the wicked.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;If he made the angels also voluntary agents, and the wicked one departed from a state of righteousness, why has he been honoured with a post of command?&#160; Is it not plain that he who thus honoured him takes pleasure in the wicked, in that he has thus honoured him?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1441"></A><A HREF="#fn_1441"><FONT SIZE="1">1442</FONT></A>
&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;If God set him by law, when he rebelled, to rule over those who were like him, ordering him to inflict punishment on those who sin, He is not unjust.&#160; But if it be the case that He has honoured him even after his revolt, He who honoured him saw beforehand his usefulness; for the honour is temporary, and it is right that the wicked should be ruled by the wicked one, and that sinners should be punished by him.&#8221;</p>
