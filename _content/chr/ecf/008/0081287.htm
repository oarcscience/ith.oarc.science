<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xiii.xvii-p2"></A>When Joseph had thus spoken, the chief priests cried out to the people:&#160; We know that Jesus had a father and mother; how can we believe that he is the Christ?&#160; One of the Levites answered and said:&#160; I know the family of Jesus, noble-minded men,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1926"></A><A HREF="#fn_1926"><FONT SIZE="1">1927</FONT></A>
 great servants of God, and receiving tithes from the people of the Jews.&#160; And I know also Symeon the <A NAME="page_434"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 434</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xiii.xvii-Page_434"></A>elder, that he received him when he was an infant, and said to him:&#160; Now thou sendest away Thy servant, O Lord.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.xvii-p4"></A>The Jews said:&#160; Let us now find the three men that saw him on the Mount of Olives, that we may question them, and learn the truth more accurately.&#160; They found them, and brought them before all, and made them swear to tell the truth.&#160; And they said:&#160; As the God of Israel liveth, we saw Jesus alive on the Mount of Olives, and going up into heaven.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.xvii-p5"></A>Then Annas and Caiaphas took the three apart, one by one, and questioned them singly in private.&#160; They agreed with one another, therefore, and gave, even the three, one account.&#160; The chief priests answered, saying:&#160; Our Scripture says that every word shall be established by two or three witnesses.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1927"></A><A HREF="#fn_1927"><FONT SIZE="1">1928</FONT></A>
&#160; Joseph, then, has confessed that he, along with Nicodemus, attended to his body, and buried him, and how it is the truth that he has risen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1928"></A><A HREF="#fn_1928"><FONT SIZE="1">1929</FONT></A>
