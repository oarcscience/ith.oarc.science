Do Not.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.x-p2"></span>And after Lazarus, Joseph, who also
was one of his followers, said:  “You have spoken all things rightly. 
Teach me also this, as I am eager to know it, why, when you give the
same discourses to all, some believe and others disbelieve?”  And Peter
said:  “It is because my discourses are not charms, so that every one
that hears them must without hesitation believe them.  The fact that
some believe, and others do not, points out to the intelligent the
freedom of the will.”  And when he said this, we all blessed him.
