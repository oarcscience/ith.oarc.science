<span id="vii.v.xviii-p2"></span>And when Herod <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656) saw that he had been made sport of
by the magi, his heart swelled with rage, and he sent through all the
roads, wishing to seize them and put them to death.  But when he could
not find them at all, he sent anew to Bethlehem and all its borders, and
slew all the male children whom he found of two years old and under,
according to the time that he had ascertained from the magi. <span

<span id="vii.v.xviii-p5"></span>Now the day before this was done Joseph
was warned in his sleep by the angel of the Lord, who said to him:  Take
Mary and the child, and go into Egypt by the way of the desert.  And
Joseph went according to the saying of the angel. <span
