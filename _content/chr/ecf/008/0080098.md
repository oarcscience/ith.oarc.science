for a Time.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxxvi-p2"></span>“When meantime Moses, that
faithful and wise steward, perceived that the vice of sacrificing to
idols had been deeply ingrained into the people from their association
with the Egyptians, and that the root of this evil could not be
extracted from them, he allowed them indeed to sacrifice, but permitted
it to be done only to God, that by any means he might cut off one half
of the deeply ingrained evil, leaving the other half to be corrected by
another, and at a future time; by Him, namely, concerning whom he said
himself, ‘A prophet shall the Lord your God raise unto you, whom ye
shall hear even as myself, according to all things which He shall say to
you.  Whosoever shall not hear that prophet, his soul shall be cut off
from his people. <span id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558)
