<span id="x.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="x.xiii-p1.1"></span>Serapion, <span
id="fr_3786"></span>[3787](#fn_3786) Bishop of Antioch.</span>

<span id="x.xiii-p3"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.xiii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> *circa* 190–200–211.\]  He was the
eighth bishop of Antioch, a diligent writer and exemplary pastor. 
Little as we have of his remains, Lardner shows how very useful is that
little.  (1) He testifies to the Apostles as delivering the words of
Christ Himself; (2) to the jealousy of the early Christians in sifting
inspired writings from those of no authority as Scriptures; (3) to their
methods, as in the case of the pseudo-gospel of Peter; and (4) to the
utterly apocryphal <span id="page_775">p. 775</span> <span
id="x.xiii-Page_775"></span>character of that book, which Grabe and
others suppose to be the work of Leucius, a noted forger and falsifier. 
It had never been heard of in the great See of Antioch, and this famous
bishop could only get sight of it by fishing it out of the dirty pool of
the Docetæ.

<span id="x.xiii-p5"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xiii-p5.1"></span>From the Epistle to Caricus and Ponticus. <span
id="fr_3787"></span>[3788](#fn_3787) </span>

<span id="x.xiii-p7"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="x.xiii-p7.1"></span>That</span> ye may see also that the proceedings
of this lying confederacy, <span id="fr_3788"></span>[3789](#fn_3788) to
which is given the name of New Prophecy, is abominated among the whole
brotherhood throughout the world, I have sent you letters of the most
blessed Claudius Apollinarius, who was made bishop of Hierapolis in
Asia.

<span id="x.xiii-p9"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xiii-p9.1"></span>II.</span>

<span id="x.xiii-p10"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.xiii-p10.1"></span>From the Book Concerning the Gospel of
Peter. <span id="fr_3789"></span>[3790](#fn_3789) </span>

<span id="x.xiii-p12"></span>For we, brethren, receive both Peter and
the rest of the apostles as Christ *Himself*.  But those writings which
are falsely inscribed with their name, <span
id="fr_3790"></span>[3791](#fn_3790) we as experienced persons reject,
knowing that no such writings have been handed down to us. <span
id="fr_3791"></span>[3792](#fn_3791)   When, indeed, I came to see you,
I supposed that all were in accord with the orthodox faith; and,
although I had not read through the Gospel inscribed with the name of
Peter which was brought forward by them, I said:  If this is the only
thing which threatens <span id="fr_3792"></span>[3793](#fn_3792) to
produce ill-feeling among you, let it be read.  But, now that I have
learnt from what has been told me that their mind was secretly
cherishing some heresy, <span id="fr_3793"></span>[3794](#fn_3793) I
will make all haste to come to you again.  Expect me therefore,
brethren, shortly.  Moreover, brethren, we, having discovered to what
kind of heresy Marcion adhered, and seen how he contradicted himself,
not understanding of what he was speaking, as you will gather from what
has been written to you <span id="fr_3794"></span>[3795](#fn_3794) —for,
having borrowed this said Gospel from those who were familiar with it
from constant perusal, namely from the successors of those who were his
leaders *in the heresy*, whom we call Docetæ (for most of the opinions
held by him are derived from their teaching), we were able to read it
through; and while we found most of its contents to agree with the
orthodox account of the Saviour, we found some things inconsistent with
that, and these we have set down below for your inspection.
