Lying.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lxiv-p2"></span>When Appion heard this, and those
who were with him, they raised a great howling, saying:  “Why have you
done this?  Why did you not receive him?”  And when Athenodorus was
going to tell me that it was my father Faustinianus himself, Appion
prevented him, and said:  <span id="page_209">p. 209</span> <span
id="vi.iii.xii.lxiv-Page_209"></span>“We have learned from some one that
he has gone with Simon, and that at the entreaty of Faustinianus
himself, being unwilling to see his sons, because they are Jews.  When
therefore we heard this, we came to inquire after him here; but since he
is not here, it appears that he must have spoken truly who told us that
he has gone with Simon.  This, therefore, we tell you.”  But I Clement,
when I understood the designs of Peter, that he wished to make them
suppose that the old man would be required at their hands, so that they
might be afraid and flee away, I began to aid his design, and said to
Appion:  “Listen, dear Appion:  what we believe to be good, we wish to
deliver to our father also; but if he will not receive it, but rather,
as you say, flees away through abhorrence of us—it may perhaps be harsh
to say so—we care nothing about him.”  And when I had said this, they
departed, cursing my cruelty, and followed the track of Simon, as we
learned on the following day.
