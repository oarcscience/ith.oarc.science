<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lxi-p2"></A>However, rubbing his forehead with his hand, he said:&#160; &#8220;Be of good courage, my brethren, and comfort your sorrowful hearts by means of counsel, referring all things to God, whose will alone is to be fulfilled and to be preferred in all things.&#160; For let us suppose for a moment, that by reason of the affection that we have towards you, we should act against His will, and remain with you, is He not able, by sending death upon me, to appoint to me a longer separation from you?&#160; And therefore it is better for us to carry out this shorter separation with His will, as those to whom it is prescribed to obey God in all things.&#160; Hence you also ought to obey Him with like submission, inasmuch as you love me from no other reason than on account of your love of Him.&#160; As friends of God, therefore, acquiesce in His will; but also judge yourselves what is right.&#160; Would it not have seemed wicked, if, when Simon was deceiving you, I had been detained by the brethren in Jerusalem, and had not come to you, and that although you had Zacch&aelig;us among you, a good and eloquent man?&#160; So now also consider that it would be wicked, if, when Simon has gone forth to assail the Gentiles, who are wholly without a defender, I should be detained by you, and should not follow him.&#160; Wherefore let us see to it, that we do not, by an unreasonable affection, accomplish the will of the wicked one.&#8221;</p>
