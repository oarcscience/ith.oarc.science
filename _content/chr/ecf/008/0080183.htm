<p class="c35"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xlvi-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xlvi-p1.1"></A>Chapter XLVI.&#8212;Christ Acknowledged the God of the Jews.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xlvi-p2"></A>&#8220;Wherefore also our Lord, who wrought signs and wonders, preached the God of the Jews; and therefore we are right in believing what He preached.&#160; But as for you, even if you were really a prophet, and performed signs and wonders, as you promise to do, if you were to announce other gods besides Him who is the true God, it would be manifest that you were raised up as a trial to the people of God; and therefore you can by no means be believed.&#160; For He alone is the true God, who is the God of the Jews; and for this reason our Lord Jesus Christ did not teach them that they must inquire after God, for Him they knew well already, but that they must seek His kingdom and righteousness,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_655"></A><A HREF="#fn_655"><FONT SIZE="1">656</FONT></A>
 which the scribes and Pharisees, having received the key of knowledge, had not shut in, but shut out.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_656"></A><A HREF="#fn_656"><FONT SIZE="1">657</FONT></A>
&#160; For if they had been ignorant of the true God, surely He would never have left the knowledge of this thing, which was the chief of all, and blamed them for small and little things, as for enlarging their fringes, and claiming the uppermost rooms in feasts, and praying standing in the highways, and such like things; which assuredly, in comparison of this great charge, ignorance of God, seem to be small and insignificant matters.&#8221;</p>
