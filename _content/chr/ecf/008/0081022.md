id="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Peter’s Speech
Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-p2"></span>“Foolish, therefore, is every
husband who separates his wife from the fear of God; for she who does
not fear God is not afraid of her husband.  If she fear not God, who
sees what is invisible, how will she be chaste in her unseen
choice? <span id="fr_1182"></span>[1183](#fn_1182)   And how will she be
chaste, who does not come to the assembly to hear chaste-making words? 
And how could she obtain admonition?  And how will she be chaste without
watchmen, <span id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-Page_304"></span>if she be not informed in regard to
the coming judgement of God, and if she be not fully assured that
eternal punishment is the penalty for the slight pleasure?  Wherefore,
on the other hand, compel her even against her will always to come to
hear the chaste-making word, yea, coax her to do so.

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-p3"></span> “In her unseen choice” means, in
what course of conduct she really prefers in her heart.  This reading
occurs in one <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-p3.1"></span>ms.</span>; in the other <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xvi.xvii-p3.2"></span>ms.</span> it is
corrupt.  Schwegler amended it into, How shall she be chaste towards him
who does not see *what is invisible*?” and the emendation is adopted by
Dressel.
