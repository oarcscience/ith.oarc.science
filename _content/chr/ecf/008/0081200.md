<span id="vii.v.xxiii-p2"></span>After this, while they were going on
their journey, Joseph said to Jesus:  Lord, it is a boiling heat; if it
please Thee, let us go by the sea-shore, that we may be able to rest in
the cities on the coast.  Jesus said to him:  Fear not, Joseph; I will
shorten the way for you, so that what you would have taken thirty days
to go over, you shall accomplish in this one day.  And while they were
thus speaking, behold, they looked forward, and began to see the
mountains and cities of Egypt.

<span id="vii.v.xxiii-p3"></span>And rejoicing and exulting, they came
into the regions of Hermopolis, and entered into a certain city of Egypt
which is called Sotinen; <span id="fr_1662"></span>[1663](#fn_1662) and
because they knew no one there from whom they could ask hospitality,
they went into a temple which was called the Capitol of Egypt.  And in
this temple there had been set up three hundred and fifty-five
idols, <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1664](#fn_1663) to each of which on
its own day divine honours and sacred rites were paid.  For the
Egyptians belonging to the same city entered the Capitol, in which the
priests told them how many sacrifices were offered each day, according
to the honour in which the god was held.

Egyptians.—*Jerome on Isaiah*.
