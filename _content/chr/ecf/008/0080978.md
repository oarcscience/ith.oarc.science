<span id="vi.iv.xv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—“Not to Be Ministered Unto,
But to Minister.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.vii-p2"></span>But I, when I heard this, fell
a-trembling and weeping, that such a word should be spoken by a man to
whom all the men of this generation are inferior in point of knowledge
and piety.  But he, seeing me weeping, asked the cause of my tears. 
Then I said, “In what have I sinned so that you have spoken to me such a
word?”  Then Peter answered, “If it were wrong of me to speak of being
your servant, you were first in fault in asking to be mine.”  Then I
said, “The cases are not parallel; for to do this indeed becomes me
well; but it is terrible for you, the herald of God, and who savest our
souls, to do this to me.”  Then Peter answered, “I should agree with
you, but that <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144) our Lord, who
came for the salvation of all the world, being alone noble above all,
submitted to the condition of a servant, that He might persuade us not
to be ashamed to perform the ministrations of servants to our brethren,
however well-born we may be.”  Then I said, “If I think to overcome you
in argument, I am foolish.  However, I thank the providence of God, that
I have been thought worthy to have you instead of parents.”
