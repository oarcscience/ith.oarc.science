<p class="c34"><a name="ix.vii-p3"></A><span class="c6"><a name="ix.vii-p3.1"></A>The Teaching of the Apostles.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3053"></A><A HREF="#fn_3053"><FONT SIZE="1">3054</FONT></A>
</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.vii-p5"></A><span class="c9"><a name="ix.vii-p5.1"></A>At</span> that time Christ was taken up to His Father; and how the apostles received the gift of the Spirit; and the Ordinances and Laws of the Church; and whither each one of the apostles went; and from whence the countries in the territory of the Romans received the ordination to the priesthood.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p6"></A>In the year three hundred and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3054"></A><A HREF="#fn_3054"><FONT SIZE="1">3055</FONT></A>
 thirty-nine of the kingdom of the Greeks, in the month Heziran,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3055"></A><A HREF="#fn_3055"><FONT SIZE="1">3056</FONT></A>
 on the fourth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3056"></A><A HREF="#fn_3056"><FONT SIZE="1">3057</FONT></A>
 day of the same, which is the first day of the week, and the end of Pentecost&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3057"></A><A HREF="#fn_3057"><FONT SIZE="1">3058</FONT></A>
&#8212;on the selfsame day came the disciples from Nazareth of Galilee, where the conception of our Lord was announced, to the mount which is called that of the Place of Olives,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3058"></A><A HREF="#fn_3058"><FONT SIZE="1">3059</FONT></A>
 our Lord being with them, but not being visible to them.&#160; And at the time of early dawn our Lord lifted up His hands, and laid them upon the heads of the eleven disciples, and gave to them the gift of the priesthood.&#160; And suddenly a bright cloud received Him.&#160; And they saw Him as He was going up to heaven.&#160; And He sat down on the right hand of His Father.&#160; And they praised God because they saw His ascension according as He had told them; and they rejoiced because they had received the Right Hand conferring on them the priesthood of the house of Moses and Aaron.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p12"></A>And from thence they went up <i>to the city</i>, and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3059"></A><A HREF="#fn_3059"><FONT SIZE="1">3060</FONT></A>
 proceeded to an upper room&#8212;that in which our Lord had observed the passover with them, and the place where the inquiries had been made:&#160; Who it was that should betray our Lord to the crucifiers?&#160; There also were <i>made</i> the inquiries:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3060"></A><A HREF="#fn_3060"><FONT SIZE="1">3061</FONT></A>
&#160; How they should preach His Gospel in the world?&#160; And, as within the upper room the mystery of the body and of the blood of our Lord began to prevail in the world, so also from thence did the teaching of His preaching begin to have authority in the world.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p15"></A>And, when the disciples were cast into this perplexity, how they should preach His Gospel to <i>men of</i> strange tongues&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3061"></A><A HREF="#fn_3061"><FONT SIZE="1">3062</FONT></A>
 which were unknown to them, and were speaking thus to one another:&#160; Although we are confident that Christ will perform by our hands mighty works and miracles in the presence of strange peoples whose tongues we know not, and who themselves also are unversed in our tongue, <i>yet</i> who shall teach them and make them understand that it is by the name of Christ who was crucified that these mighty works and miracles are done?&#8212;while, I say, the disciples were occupied with these thoughts, Simon Cephas rose up, and said to them:&#160; My brethren, this matter, how we shall preach His Gospel, pertaineth not to us, but to our Lord; for <i>He</i> knoweth how it is possible for us to preach His Gospel in the world; and we rely on His care for us, which He promised us, saying:&#160; &#8220;When I am ascended to my Father I will send you the Spirit, the Paraclete, that <i>He</i> may teach you everything which it is meet for you to know, and to make known.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p17"></A>And, whilst Simon Cephas was saying these things to his fellow-apostles, and putting them in remembrance, a mysterious voice was heard by them, and a sweet odour, which was strange to the world, breathed upon them;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3062"></A><A HREF="#fn_3062"><FONT SIZE="1">3063</FONT></A>
 and tongues of fire, between the voice and the odour, came down from heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3063"></A><A HREF="#fn_3063"><FONT SIZE="1">3064</FONT></A>
 towards them, and alighted and sat on every one of them; and, according to the tongue which every one of them had severally received, so did he prepare himself to go <A NAME="page_668"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 668</FONT></A> <a name="ix.vii-Page_668"></A>to the country in which that tongue was spoken and heard.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p20"></A>And, by the same gift of the Spirit which was given to them on that day, they appointed Ordinances and Laws&#8212;such as were in accordance with the Gospel of their preaching, and with the true and faithful doctrine of their teaching:&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p21"></A>1.&#160; The apostles therefore appointed:&#160; Pray ye towards the east:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3064"></A><A HREF="#fn_3064"><FONT SIZE="1">3065</FONT></A>
&#160; because, &#8220;as the lightning which lighteneth from the east and is seen even to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of man be:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3065"></A><A HREF="#fn_3065"><FONT SIZE="1">3066</FONT></A>
&#160; that by this we might know and understand that He will appear from the east suddenly.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3066"></A><A HREF="#fn_3066"><FONT SIZE="1">3067</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p26"></A>2.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; On the first <i>day</i> of the week let there be service, and the reading of the Holy Scriptures, and the oblation:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3067"></A><A HREF="#fn_3067"><FONT SIZE="1">3068</FONT></A>
&#160; because on the first day of the week our Lord rose from the place of the dead and on the first day of the week He arose upon the world, and on the first day of the week He ascended up to heaven, and on the first day of the week He will appear at last with the angels of heaven.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3068"></A><A HREF="#fn_3068"><FONT SIZE="1">3069</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p29"></A>3.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; On the fourth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3069"></A><A HREF="#fn_3069"><FONT SIZE="1">3070</FONT></A>
 day of the week let there be service:&#160; because on that <i>day</i> our Lord made the disclosure to them about His trial,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3070"></A><A HREF="#fn_3070"><FONT SIZE="1">3071</FONT></A>
 and His suffering, and His crucifixion, and His death, and His resurrection; and the disciples were on account of this in sorrow.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3071"></A><A HREF="#fn_3071"><FONT SIZE="1">3072</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p33"></A>4.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; On the eve <i>of the Sabbath</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3072"></A><A HREF="#fn_3072"><FONT SIZE="1">3073</FONT></A>
 at the ninth hour, let there be service:&#160; because that which had been spoken on the fourth day of the week about the suffering of the Saviour was brought to pass on the <i>same</i> eve; the worlds and creatures trembling, and the luminaries in the heavens being darkened.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p35"></A>5.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Let there be elders and deacons, like the Levites;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3073"></A><A HREF="#fn_3073"><FONT SIZE="1">3074</FONT></A>
 and subdeacons,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3074"></A><A HREF="#fn_3074"><FONT SIZE="1">3075</FONT></A>
 like those who carried the vessels of the court of the sanctuary of the Lord; and an overseer,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3075"></A><A HREF="#fn_3075"><FONT SIZE="1">3076</FONT></A>
 who shall likewise be the Guide of all the people,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3076"></A><A HREF="#fn_3076"><FONT SIZE="1">3077</FONT></A>
 like Aaron, the head and chief of all the priests and Levites of the whole city.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3077"></A><A HREF="#fn_3077"><FONT SIZE="1">3078</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p41"></A>6.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Celebrate the day of the Epiphany&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3078"></A><A HREF="#fn_3078"><FONT SIZE="1">3079</FONT></A>
 of our Saviour, which is the chief of the festivals of the Church, on the sixth day of the latter Canun,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3079"></A><A HREF="#fn_3079"><FONT SIZE="1">3080</FONT></A>
 in the long number of the Greeks.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3080"></A><A HREF="#fn_3080"><FONT SIZE="1">3081</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p46"></A>7.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Forty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3081"></A><A HREF="#fn_3081"><FONT SIZE="1">3082</FONT></A>
 days before the day of the passion of our Saviour fast ye, and then celebrate the day of the passion, and the day of the resurrection:&#160; because our Lord Himself also, the Lord of the festival, fasted forty days; and Moses and Elijah, who were endued with this mystery, likewise each fasted forty days, and then were glorified.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p48"></A>8.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; At the conclusion of all the Scriptures <i>other</i> let the Gospel be read, as being the seal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3082"></A><A HREF="#fn_3082"><FONT SIZE="1">3083</FONT></A>
 of all the Scriptures; and let the people listen to it standing upon their feet:&#160; because it is the Gospel of the redemption of all men.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p50"></A>9.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; At the completion of fifty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3083"></A><A HREF="#fn_3083"><FONT SIZE="1">3084</FONT></A>
 days after His resurrection make ye a commemoration of His ascension to His glorious Father.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p52"></A>10.&#160; The apostles appointed:&#160; That, beside the Old Testament, and the Prophets, and the Gospel, and the Acts (of their exploits), nothing should be read on the pulpit in the church.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3084"></A><A HREF="#fn_3084"><FONT SIZE="1">3085</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p54"></A>11.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Whosoever is unacquainted with the faith of the Church and the ordinances and laws which are appointed in it, let him not be a guide and ruler; and whosoever is acquainted with them and departs from them, let him not minister again:&#160; because, not being true in his ministry, he has lied.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p55"></A>12.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Whosoever sweareth, or&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3085"></A><A HREF="#fn_3085"><FONT SIZE="1">3086</FONT></A>
 lieth, or beareth false witness, or hath recourse to magicians and soothsayers and Chaldeans, and putteth confidence in fates and nativities, which they hold fast who know not God,&#8212;let him also, as a man that knoweth not God, be dismissed from the ministry, and not minister <i>again</i>.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p57"></A><A NAME="page_669"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 669</FONT></A> <a name="ix.vii-Page_669"></A>13.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; If there be any man that is divided <i>in mind</i> touching the ministry, and who follows it not with a steadfast will&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3086"></A><A HREF="#fn_3086"><FONT SIZE="1">3087</FONT></A>
, let not this man minister again:&#160; because the Lord of the ministry is not served by him with a stedfast will; and he deceiveth man <i>only</i>, and not God, &#8220;before whom crafty devices avail not.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3087"></A><A HREF="#fn_3087"><FONT SIZE="1">3088</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p61"></A>14.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Whosoever lendeth and receiveth usury,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3088"></A><A HREF="#fn_3088"><FONT SIZE="1">3089</FONT></A>
 and is occupied in merchandise and covetousness, let not this man minister again, nor continue in the ministry.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p63"></A>15.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; That whosoever loveth the Jews,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3089"></A><A HREF="#fn_3089"><FONT SIZE="1">3090</FONT></A>
 like Iscariot, who was their friend, or the pagans, who worship creatures instead of the Creator,&#8212;should not enter in amongst them and minister; and moreover, that if he be <i>already</i> amongst them, they should not suffer him <i>to remain</i>, but that he should be separated from amongst them, and not minister with them again.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p65"></A>16.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; That, if any one from the Jews or from the pagans come and join himself with them, and if after he has joined himself with them he turn and go back again to the side on which he stood <i>before</i>, and if he again return and come to them a second time,&#8212;he should not be received again; but that, according to the side on which he was before, so those who know him should look upon him.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p66"></A>17.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; That it should not be permitted to the Guide to transact the matters which pertain to the Church apart from those who minister with him; but that he should issue commands with the counsel of them all, and that that <i>only</i> should be done which all of them should concur in and not disapprove.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3090"></A><A HREF="#fn_3090"><FONT SIZE="1">3091</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p68"></A>18.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Whenever any shall depart out of this world with a good testimony to the faith of Christ, and with affliction <i>borne</i> for His name&#146;s sake, make ye a commemoration of them on the day on which they were put to death.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3091"></A><A HREF="#fn_3091"><FONT SIZE="1">3092</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p70"></A>19.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; In the service of the Church repeat ye the praises of David day by day:&#160; because of this <i>saying</i>:&#160; &#8220;I will bless the Lord at all times, and at all times His praises <i>shall be</i> in my mouth;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3092"></A><A HREF="#fn_3092"><FONT SIZE="1">3093</FONT></A>
 and <i>this:</i>&#160; &#8220;By day and by night will I meditate and speak, and cause my voice to be heard before Thee.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p72"></A>20.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; If any divest themselves of mammon and run not after the gain of money, let these men be chosen and admitted to the ministry of the altar.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p73"></A>21.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Let any priest who accidentally puts <i>another</i> in bonds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3093"></A><A HREF="#fn_3093"><FONT SIZE="1">3094</FONT></A>
 contrary to justice receive the punishment that is right; and let him that has been bound receive the bonds as if he had been equitably bound.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p75"></A>22.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; If it be seen that those who are accustomed to hear causes show partiality, and pronounce the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent, let them never again hear another cause: &#160;<i>thus</i> receiving the rebuke of their partiality, as it is fit.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3094"></A><A HREF="#fn_3094"><FONT SIZE="1">3095</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p77"></A>23.&#160; The apostles further ordained:&#160; Let not those that are high-minded and lifted up with the arrogance of boasting be admitted to the ministry:&#160; because of this <i>text:</i>&#160; &#8220;That which is exalted among men is abominable before God;&#8221; and because concerning them it is said:&#160; &#8220;I will return a recompense upon those that vaunt themselves.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p78"></A>24.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Let there be a Ruler over the elders who are in the villages, and let him be recognised as head of them all, at whose hand all of them shall be required:&#160; for Samuel also thus made visits from place to place and ruled.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3095"></A><A HREF="#fn_3095"><FONT SIZE="1">3096</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p80"></A>25.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; That those kings who shall hereafter believe in Christ should be permitted to go up and stand before the altar along with the Guides of the Church:&#160; because David also, and those who were like him, went up and stood before the altar.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3096"></A><A HREF="#fn_3096"><FONT SIZE="1">3097</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p82"></A>26.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Let no man dare to do anything by the authority of the priesthood which is not in accordance with justice and equity, but in accordance with justice, and free from the blame of partiality, <i>let all things be done</i>.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p83"></A>27.&#160; The apostles further appointed:&#160; Let the bread of the Oblation be placed upon the altar on the day on which it is baked, and not some days after&#8212;a thing which is not permitted.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p84"></A>All these things did the apostles appoint, not <A NAME="page_670"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 670</FONT></A> <a name="ix.vii-Page_670"></A>for themselves, but for those who should come after them&#8212;for they were apprehensive that in time to come wolves would put on sheep&#146;s clothing:&#160; since for themselves the Spirit, the Paraclete, which was in them, was sufficient:&#160; that, even as He had appointed these laws by their hands, <i>so</i> He would guide them lawfully.&#160; For they, who had received from our Lord power and authority, had no need that laws should be appointed for them by others.&#160; For Paul also, and Timothy,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3097"></A><A HREF="#fn_3097"><FONT SIZE="1">3098</FONT></A>
 while they were going from place to place in the country of Syria and Cilicia, committed these same Commands and Laws of the apostles and elders to those who were under the hand of the apostles, for the churches of the countries in which they were preaching and publishing the Gospel.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p86"></A>The disciples, moreover, after they had appointed these Ordinances and Laws, ceased not from the preaching of the Gospel, or from the wonderful mighty-works which our Lord did by their hands.&#160; For much people was gathered about them every day, who believed in Christ; and they came to them from other cities, and heard their words and received them.&#160; Nicodemus also, and Gamaliel, chiefs of the synagogue of the Jews, used to come to the apostles in secret, agreeing with their teaching.&#160; Judas, moreover, and Levi, and Peri, and Joseph, and Justus, sons of Hananias, and Caiaphas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3098"></A><A HREF="#fn_3098"><FONT SIZE="1">3099</FONT></A>
 and Alexander the priests&#8212;they too used to come to the apostles by night, confessing Christ that He is the Son of God; but they were afraid of the people of their own nation, so that they did not disclose their mind toward the disciples.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p88"></A>And the apostles received them affectionately, saying to them:&#160; Do not, by reason of the shame and fear of men, forfeit your salvation before God, nor have the blood of Christ required of you; even as your fathers, who took it upon them:&#160; for it is not acceptable before God, that, while ye are, <i>in secret</i>, with His worshippers, ye should go and associate with the murderers of His adorable Son.&#160; How do ye expect that your faith should be accepted with those that are true, whilst ye are with those that are false?&#160; But it becomes you, as men who believe in Christ, to confess openly this faith which we preach.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3099"></A><A HREF="#fn_3099"><FONT SIZE="1">3100</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p90"></A>And, when they heard these things from the Disciples, those sons of the priests, all of them alike, cried out before the whole company of the apostles:&#160; We confess and believe in Christ who was crucified, and we confess that He is from everlasting the Son of God; and those who dared to crucify Him do we renounce.&#160; For even the priests of the people in secret confess Christ; but, for the sake of the headship among the people which they love, they are not willing to confess openly; and they have forgotten that which is written:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3100"></A><A HREF="#fn_3100"><FONT SIZE="1">3101</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;Of knowledge is He the Lord, and before Him avail not crafty devices.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p92"></A>And, when their fathers heard these things from their sons, they became exceedingly hostile to them:&#160; not indeed because they had believed in Christ, but because they had declared and spoken openly of the mind of their fathers before the sons of their people.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p93"></A>But those who believed clove to the disciples, and departed not from them, because they saw that, whatsoever they taught the multitude, they themselves carried into practice before all men; and, when affliction and persecution arose against the disciples, they rejoiced to be afflicted with them, and received with gladness stripes and imprisonment for the confession of their faith in Christ; and all the days of their life they preached Christ before the Jews and the Samaritans.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.vii-p94"></A>And after the death of the apostles there were Guides and Rulers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3101"></A><A HREF="#fn_3101"><FONT SIZE="1">3102</FONT></A>
 in the churches; and, whatsoever the apostles had committed to them and they had received from them, they continued to teach to the multitude through the whole space of their lives.&#160; They too, again, at their deaths committed and delivered to their disciples after them whatsoever they had received from the apostles; also what James had written from Jerusalem, and Simon from the city of Rome, and John from Ephesus, and Mark from Alexandria the Great, and Andrew from Phrygia, and Luke from Macedonia, and Judas Thomas from India:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3102"></A><A HREF="#fn_3102"><FONT SIZE="1">3103</FONT></A>
