<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lxxi-p2"></A>&#8220;But our friends lifted him up, for they were both more numerous and more powerful than the others; but, from their fear of God, they rather suffered themselves to be killed by an inferior force, than they would kill others.&#160; But when the evening came the priests shut up the temple, and we returned to the house of James, and spent the night there in prayer.&#160; Then before daylight we went down to Jericho, to the number of 5000 men.&#160; Then after three days one of the brethren came to us from Gamaliel, whom we mentioned before, bringing to us secret tidings that that enemy had received a commission from Caiaphas, the chief priest, that he should arrest all who believed in Jesus, and should go to Damascus with his letters, and that there also, employing the help of the unbelievers, he should make havoc among the faithful; and that he was hastening to Damascus chiefly on this account, because he believed that Peter had fled thither.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">597</FONT></A>
&#160; And about thirty days thereafter he stopped on his way while passing through Jericho going to Damascus.&#160; At that time we were absent, having gone out to the sepulchres of two brethren which were whitened of themselves every year, by which miracle the fury of many against us was restrained, because they saw that our brethren were had in remembrance before God.&#8221;</p>
