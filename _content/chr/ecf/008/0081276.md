id="vii.xiii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 5.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii.vi-p2"></span>A God-fearing Jew, therefore, Nicodemus
by name, stood up in the midst, and said to Pilate:  I entreat your
highness to permit me to say a few words.  Say on, said Pilate. 
Nicodemus says:  I, being present in the synagogue, said to the priests,
and the Levites, and the scribes, and the people, What have you to say
against this man?  This man does many miracles, such as man has never
yet done nor will do.  Let him go, therefore; and if indeed what he does
be from God, it will stand; but if from man, it will be destroyed. <span
id="fr_1883"></span>[1884](#fn_1883)   Just as happened also when God
sent Moses into Egypt, and Pharoah king of Egypt told him to do a
miracle, and he did it.  Then Pharoah had also two magicians, Jannes and
Jambres; and they also did miracles by the use of magic art, but not
such as Moses did. <span id="fr_1884"></span>[1885](#fn_1884)   And the
Egyptians held these magicians to be gods; but because they were not
from God, what they did was destroyed.  This Jesus, then, raised up
Lazarus, and he is alive.  On this account I entreat thee, my lord, by
no means to allow this man to be put to death.

<span id="vii.xiii.vi-p5"></span>The Hebrews were enraged against
Nicodemus, and said:  Mayst thou receive the truth of Jesus, and have a
portion with him.  Nicodemus says:  Amen, amen; be it to me as you say.
