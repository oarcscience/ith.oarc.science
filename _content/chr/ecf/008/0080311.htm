<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vi.xxxv-p2"></A>&#8220;Wherefore observe the greatest caution, that you believe no teacher, unless he bring from Jerusalem the testimonial of James the Lord&#146;s brother, or of whosoever may come after him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_745"></A><A HREF="#fn_745"><FONT SIZE="1">746</FONT></A>
&#160; For no one, unless he has gone up thither, and there has been approved as a fit and faithful teacher for preaching the word of Christ,&#8212;unless, I say, he brings a testimonial thence, is by any means to be received.&#160; But let neither prophet nor apostle be looked for by you at this time, besides us.&#160; For there is one true Prophet, whose words we twelve apostles preach; for He is the accepted year of God, having us apostles as His twelve months. &#160;But for what reason the world itself was made, or what diversities have occurred in it, and why our Lord, coming for its restoration, has chosen and sent us twelve apostles, shall be explained more at length at another time.&#160; Meantime He has commanded us to go forth to preach, and to invite you to the supper of the heavenly King, which the Father hath prepared for the marriage of His Son, and that we should give you wedding garments, that is, the grace of baptism;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_746"></A><A HREF="#fn_746"><FONT SIZE="1">747</FONT></A>
 which whosoever obtains, as a spotless robe with which he is to enter to the supper of the King, ought to beware that it be not in any part of it stained with sin, and so he be rejected as unworthy and reprobate.</p>
