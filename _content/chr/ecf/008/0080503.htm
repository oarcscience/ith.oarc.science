<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p2"></A>Then I Clement, understanding that he perchance was my father, was drowned in tears, and my brothers also were ready to rush forward and to disclose the matter; but Peter restrained them, saying:&#160; &#8220;Be quiet, until I give you permission.&#8221;&#160; Therefore Peter, answering, said to the old man:&#160; &#8220;What was the name of your younger son?&#8221;&#160; And he said:&#160; &#8220;Clement.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter:&#160; &#8220;If I shall this day restore to you your most chaste wife and your three sons, will you believe that a modest mind can overcome unreasonable impulses, and that all things that have been spoken by us are true, and that <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p2.1"></A>Genesis</span> is nothing?&#8221;&#160; Then said the old man:&#160; &#8220;As <A NAME="page_191"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 191</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-Page_191"></A>it is impossible for you to perform what you have promised, so it is impossible that anything can take place apart from <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxiv-p2.2"></A>Genesis</span>.&#8221;&#160; Then says Peter:&#160; &#8220;I wish to have all who are here present as witnesses that I shall this day hand over to you your wife, who is living most chastely, with your three sons.&#160; And now take a token of these things from this, that I know the whole story much more accurately than you do; and I shall relate the whole occurrences in order, both that you may know them, and that those who are present may learn.&#8221;</p>
