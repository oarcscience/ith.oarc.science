<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.x-p2"></A>And on the second day, while Mary was at the fountain to fill her pitcher, the angel of the Lord appeared to her, saying:&#160; Blessed art thou, Mary; for in thy womb thou hast prepared an habitation for the Lord.&#160; For, lo, the light from heaven shall come and dwell in thee, and by means of thee will shine over the whole world.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.x-p3"></A>Again, on the third day, while she was working at the purple with her fingers, there entered a young man of ineffable beauty.&#160; And when Mary saw him, she exceedingly feared and trembled.&#160; And he said to her:&#160; Hail, Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with thee:&#160; blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1637"></A><A HREF="#fn_1637"><FONT SIZE="1">1638</FONT></A>
&#160; And when she heard these words, she trembled, and was exceedingly afraid.&#160; Then the angel of the Lord added:&#160; Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favour with God:&#160; Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a King, who fills not only the earth, but the heaven, and who reigns from generation to generation.</p>
