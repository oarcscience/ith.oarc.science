<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xiv-p2"></A>Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Do you think, O woman, that those who destroy themselves are set free from torments, and not rather that the souls of those who lay violent hands upon themselves are subjected to greater punishments?&#8221;&#160; Then said she:&#160; &#8220;I wish I were sure that souls live in the infernal regions, for I would gladly embrace the suffering of the penalty of suicide, only that I might see my darling children, if it were but for an hour.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter:&#160; &#8220;What thing is it so great, that effects you with so heavy sadness?&#160; I should like to know.&#160; For if you informed me of the cause, I might be able both to show you clearly, O woman, that souls do live in the infernal regions; and instead of the precipice or the deep sea, I might give you some remedy, that you may be able to end your life without torment.&#8221;</p>
