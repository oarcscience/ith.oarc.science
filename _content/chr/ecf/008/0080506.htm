<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxvii-p2"></A>But while Peter was detailing these things in the hearing of the old man, in a narrative which was most pleasing to the crowd, so that the hearers wept through wonder at the events, and through compassion for sufferings incident to humanity,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_853"></A><A HREF="#fn_853"><FONT SIZE="1">854</FONT></A>
 my mother, hearing (I know not how) of the recognition of my father, rushed into the middle of us in breathless haste, crying out, and saying:&#160; &#8220;Where is my husband, my lord Faustinianus, who has been so long afflicted, wandering from city to city in search of me?&#8221;&#160; While she shouted thus like one demented, and gazed around, the old man, running up, began to embrace and hug her with many tears.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_854"></A><A HREF="#fn_854"><FONT SIZE="1">855</FONT></A>
&#160; And while these things were going on, Peter requested the crowds to disperse, saying that it was unseemly to remain longer; but that opportunity must be afforded them of seeing one another more privately.&#160; &#8220;But to-morrow,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if any of you wish it, let them assemble to hear the word.&#8221;</p>
