id="vi.iv.xiv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—The Queen of the South
and the Men of Nineveh.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxxiii-p2"></span>“But that indeed in the day of
judgment the doings of those who have known the truth are compared with
the good deeds of those who have been in error, the unlying One Himself
has taught us, saying to those who neglected to come and listen to Him,
‘The queen of the south shall rise up with this generation, and shall
condemn it; because she came from the extremities of the earth to hear
the wisdom of Solomon:  and behold, a greater than Solomon is
here,’ <span id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135) and ye do not believe
Him.  And to those amongst the people who would not repent at His
preaching He said, ‘The men of Nineveh shall rise up with this
generation and shall condemn it, for they heard and repented on the
preaching of Jonas:  and behold, a greater is here, and no one
believes.’ <span id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136)   And thus,
setting over against all their impiety those from among the Gentiles who
have done *well*, in order to condemn those who, possessing the true
religion, had not acted so well as those who were in error, he exhorted
those having reason not only to do equally with the Gentiles whatsoever
things are excellent, but more than they.  And this speech has been
suggested to me, taking occasion from the necessity of respecting the
separation, and of washing after copulation, and of not denying such
purity, though those who are in error do the same, since those who in
error do well, without being saved, are for the condemnation of those
who are in the worship of God, *and do ill;* because their respect for
purity is through error, and not through the worship of the true Father
and God of all.”
