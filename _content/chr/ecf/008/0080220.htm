<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.x-p2"></A>Then Simon:&#160; &#8220;On what subject do you wish the discussion to be held?&#160; Tell me, that I also may define what I think, and so the inquiry may begin.&#8221;&#160; And Peter answered:&#160; &#8220;If indeed, you will do as I think right, I would have it done according to the precept of my Master, who first of all commanded the Hebrew nation, whom He knew to have knowledge of God, and that it is He who made the world, not that they should inquire about Him whom they knew, but that, knowing Him, they should investigate His will and His righteousness; because it is placed in men&#146;s power that, searching into these things, they may find, and do, and observe those things concerning which they are to be judged.&#160; Therefore He commanded us to inquire, not whence evil cometh, as you asked just now, but to seek the righteousness of the good God, and His kingdom; and all these things, says He, shall be added to you.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_680"></A><A HREF="#fn_680"><FONT SIZE="1">681</FONT></A>
&#160; Then Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Since these things are commanded to Hebrews, as having a right knowledge of God, and being of opinion that every one has it in his power to do these things concerning which he is to be judged,&#8212;but my opinion differs from theirs,&#8212;where do you wish me to begin?&#8221;</p>
