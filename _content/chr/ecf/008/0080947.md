id="vi.iv.xiv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Arguments in Favour of
Idolatry Answered.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xiii-p2"></span>“But others say, We shall act
impiously if we forsake the objects of worship handed down to us by our
fathers; for it is like the guarding of a deposit.  But on this
principle the son of a robber or a debauchee ought not to be sober and
to choose the better part, lest he should act impiously, and sin by
doing differently from his parents!  How foolish, then, are they who
say, We worship these things that we may not be troublesome to Him; as
if God were troubled by those who bless Him, and not troubled by those
who ungratefully blaspheme Him.  Why is it, then, that when there is a
withholding of rain, you look only to heaven and pour out prayers and
supplications; and when you obtain it, you quickly forget?  For when you
have reaped your harvest or gathered your vintage, you distribute your
first-fruits among those idols which are nothing, quickly forgetting God
your benefactor; and thus you go into groves and temples, and offer
sacrifices and feasts.  Wherefore some of you say, These things have
been excellently devised for the sake of good cheer and feasting.
