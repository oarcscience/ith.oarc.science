<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.ix.iii-p2"></A>&#8220;There was once a time when nothing existed but chaos and a confused mixture of orderless elements, which were as yet simply heaped together.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1058"></A><A HREF="#fn_1058"><FONT SIZE="1">1059</FONT></A>
&#160; This nature testifies, and great men have been of opinion that it was so.&#160; Of these great men I shall bring forward to you him who excelled them all in wisdom, Homer, where he says, with a reference to the original confused mass, &#145;But may you all become water and earth;&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1059"></A><A HREF="#fn_1059"><FONT SIZE="1">1060</FONT></A>
 implying that from these all things had their origin, and that all things return to their first state, which is chaos, when the watery and earthy substances are separated.&#160; And Hesiod in the <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.ix.iii-p4.1"></A>Theogony</span> says, &#145;Assuredly chaos was the very first to come into being.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1060"></A><A HREF="#fn_1060"><FONT SIZE="1">1061</FONT></A>
&#160; Now, by &#145;come into being,&#146; he evidently means that chaos came into being, as having a beginning, and did not always exist, without beginning.&#160; And Orpheus likens chaos to an egg, in which was the confused mixture of the primordial elements.&#160; This chaos, which Orpheus calls an egg, is taken for granted by Hesiod, having a beginning, produced from infinite matter, and originated in the following way.</p>
