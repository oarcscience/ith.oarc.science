<span id="vi.iv.iv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Clement’s Zeal.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xi-p2"></span>When he said this, they all, as in
concert, set up a shout of laughter, trying to silence him and put him
out, as a barbarous madman.  But I, seeing this, and seized, I know not
how, with enthusiasm, could no longer keep silence with righteous
indignation, but boldly cried out, saying, “Well has God ordained that
His counsel should be incapable of being received by you, foreseeing you
to be unworthy, as appears manifestly to such of those who are now
present as have minds capable of judging.  For whereas now heralds of
His counsel have been sent forth, not making a show of grammatical art,
but set<span id="page_226">p. 226</span> <span
id="vi.iv.iv.xi-Page_226"></span>ting forth His will in simple and in
artificial words, so that whosoever hear can understand what is spoken,
and not with any invidious feeling, as though unwilling to offer it to
all; you come here, and besides your not understanding what is for your
advantage, to your own injury you laugh at the truth, which, to your
condemnation, consorts with the barbarians, and which you will not
entertain when it visits you, by reason of your wickedness and the
plainness of its words, lest you be convicted of being merely lovers of
words, and not lovers of truth and lovers of wisdom.  How long will you
be learning to speak, who have not the power of speech? <span
id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906)   For many sayings of yours are not
worth one word.  What, then, will your Grecian multitude say, being of
one mind, if, as he says, there shall be a judgment?  “Why, O God, didst
Thou not proclaim to us Thy counsel?”  Shall you not, if you be thought
worthy of an answer at all, be told this?  “I, knowing before the
foundation of the world all characters that were to be, acted towards
each one by anticipation according to his deserts without making it
known; <span id="fr_907"></span>[908](#fn_907) but wishing to give full
assurance to those who have fled to me that this is so, and to explain
why from the beginning, and in the first ages, I did not suffer my
counsel to be publicly proclaimed; I now, in the end of the world, <span
id="fr_908"></span>[909](#fn_908) have sent heralds to proclaim my will,
and they are insulted and flouted by those who will not be benefited,
and who wilfully reject my friendship.  Oh, great wrong!  The preachers
are exposed to danger even to the loss of life, <span
id="fr_909"></span>[910](#fn_909) and that by the men who are called to
salvation.
