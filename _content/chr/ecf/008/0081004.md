id="vi.iv.xv.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Fear and Love.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxxiii-p2"></span>But I, hearing this, said:  “These
things, indeed, it is impossible to do; but to do good to enemies,
bearing all their insolences, I do not think can possibly be in human
nature.”  Then Peter answered:  “You have said truly; for philanthropy,
being the cause of immortality, is given for much.”  Then I said, “How
then is it possible to get it in the mind?”  Then Peter answered:  “O
beloved Clement, the way to get it is this:  if any one be persuaded
that enemies, ill-using for a time those whom they hate, become the
cause to them of deliverances from eternal punishment; and forthwith he
will ardently love them as benefactors.  But the way to get it, O dear
Clement, is but one, which is the fear of God.  For he who fears God
cannot indeed from the first love his neighbour as himself; for such an
order does not occur to the soul.  But by the fear of God he is able to
do the things of those who love; and thus, while he does the deeds of
love, the bride Love is, as it were, brought to the bridegroom Fear. 
And thus this bride, bringing forth philanthropic thoughts, makes her
possessor immortal, as an accurate image of God, which cannot be subject
in its nature to corruption.”  Thus while he expounded to us the
doctrine of philanthropy, the evening having set in, we turned to sleep.
