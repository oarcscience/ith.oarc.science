<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xii.vii-p2"></A>One of the Jews, stepping up, asked leave of the procurator to say a word.&#160; The procurator says:&#160; If thou wishest to say any thing, say on.&#160; And the Jew said:&#160; Thirty-eight years I lay in my bed in great agony.&#160; And when Jesus came, many demoniacs, and many lying ill of various diseases, were cured by him.&#160; And some young men, taking pity on me, carried me, bed and all, and took me to him.&#160; And when Jesus saw me, he had compassion on me, and said to me:&#160; Take up thy couch and walk.&#160; And I took up my couch, and walked.&#160; The Jews say to Pilate:&#160; Ask him on what day it was that he was cured.&#160; He that had been cured says:&#160; On a Sabbath.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1823"></A><A HREF="#fn_1823"><FONT SIZE="1">1824</FONT></A>
&#160; The Jews say:&#160; Is not this the very thing that we said, that on a Sabbath he cures and casts out demons?</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.vii-p4"></A>And another Jew stepped up and said:&#160; I was born blind; I heard sounds, but saw not a face.&#160; And as Jesus passed by, I cried out with a loud voice, Pity me, O son of David.&#160; And he pitied me, and put his hands upon my eyes, and I instantly received my sight.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1824"></A><A HREF="#fn_1824"><FONT SIZE="1">1825</FONT></A>
&#160; And another Jew stepped up and said:&#160; I was crooked, and he straightened me with a word.&#160; And another said:&#160; I was a leper, and he cured me with a word.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1825"></A><A HREF="#fn_1825"><FONT SIZE="1">1826</FONT></A>
