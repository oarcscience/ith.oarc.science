<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xiii-p2"></A>And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Now indeed our object is to show how and by whom the evil one came into being, since he did come into being; but we shall show if he came into being blamelessly, when we have finished the subject now in hand.&#160; Then I shall show how and on account of what he came into being, and I shall fully convince you that his Creator is blameless.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1431"></A><A HREF="#fn_1431"><FONT SIZE="1">1432</FONT></A>
&#160; We said, then, that the four substances were produced by God.&#160; And thus, through the volition of Him who mingled them, arose, as He wished, the choice of evils.&#160; For if it had arisen contrary to His determination, or from some other substance or cause, then God would not have had firmness of will:&#160; for perchance, even though He should not wish it, leaders of evil might continually arise, who would war against His wishes.&#160; But it is impossible that this should be the case.&#160; For no living being, and especially one capable of giving guidance, can arise from accident:&#160; for everything that is produced must be produced by some one.&#8221;</p>
