<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xiv-p2"></A>&#8220;But if any one, according to the opinion of this Simon the Samaritan, will not admit that God is just, to whom then can any one ascribe justice, or the possibility of it?&#160; For if the Root of all have it not, there is every necessity to think that it must be impossible to find it in human nature, which, is, as it were, the fruit.&#160; And if it is to be found in man, how much more in God!&#160; But if righteousness can be found nowhere, neither in God nor in man, then neither can unrighteousness.&#160; But there is such a thing as righteousness, for unrighteousness takes its name from the existence of righteousness; for it is called unrighteousness, when righteousness is compared with it, and is found to be opposite to it.</p>
