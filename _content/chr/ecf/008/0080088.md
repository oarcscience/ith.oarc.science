id="vi.iii.iii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Friendship of God; How
Secured.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>To this Peter answered:  “I am
exceedingly delighted, O Clement, that I commit my words to so safe a
heart; for to be mindful of the things that are spoken is an indication
of having in readiness the faith of works.  But he from whom the wicked
demon steals away the words of salvation, and snatches them away from
his memory, cannot be saved, even though he wish it; for he loses the
way by which life is reached.  Wherefore let us the rather repeat what
has been spoken, and confirm it in your heart, that is, in what manner
or by whom the world was made, that we may proceed to the friendship of
the Creator.  But His friendship is secured by living well, and by
obeying His will; which will is the law of all that live.  We shall
therefore unfold these things briefly to you, in order that they may be
the more surely remembered.
