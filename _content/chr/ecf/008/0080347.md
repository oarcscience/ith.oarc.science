id="vi.iii.vii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—Origin of
Impiety.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxxiii-p2"></span>“Hence is the origin of all
impiety; hence murders, adulteries, thefts; and a nursery is formed of
all evils and wickednesses, while you indulge in profane libations and
odours, and give to wicked spirits an opportunity of ruling and
obtaining some sort of authority over you.  For when they invade your
senses, what do they else than work the things which belong to lust and
injustice and cruelty, and compel you to be obedient to all things that
are pleasing to them?  God, indeed, permits you to suffer this at their
hands by a certain righteous judgment, that from the very disgrace of
your doings and your feelings you may understand how unworthy it is to
be subject to demons and not to God.  Hence also, by the friendship of
demons, men are brought to disgraceful and base deeds; hence, men
proceed even to the destruction of life, either through the fire of
lust, or through the madness of anger through excess of grief, so that,
as is well <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769) known, some have even
laid violent hands upon themselves.  And this, as we have said, by a
just sentence of God they are not prevented from doing, that they may
both understand to whom they have yielded themselves in subjection, and
know whom they have forsaken.
