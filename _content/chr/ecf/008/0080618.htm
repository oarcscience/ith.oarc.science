<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.viii-p2"></A>While I spoke thus concerning others, I also lectured myself, saying, Why do I blame others, being myself guilty of the very same crime of heedlessness?&#160; But I shall hasten into Jud&aelig;a, having first arranged my affairs.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">903</FONT></A>
