<p class="c35"><a name="vi.iv.v.xxii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iv.v.xxii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXII.&#8212;Doctrines of Simon.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xxii-p2"></A>First Aquila began to speak in this wise:&#160; &#8220;Listen, O dearest brother, that you may know accurately everything about this man, whose he is, and what, and whence; and what the things are which he does, and how and why he does them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">931</FONT></A>
&#160; This Simon is the son of Antonius and Rachel, a Samaritan by race, of the village of Gitth&aelig;, which is six schoeni distant from the city.&#160; He having disciplined himself greatly in Alexandria,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_931"><FONT SIZE="1">932</FONT></A>
 and being very powerful in magic, and being ambitious, wishes to be accounted a certain supreme power, greater even than the God who created the world.&#160; And sometimes intimating <A NAME="page_233"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 233</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.v.xxii-Page_233"></A>that he is Christ, he styles himself the Standing One.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="#fn_932"><FONT SIZE="1">933</FONT></A>
&#160; And this epithet he employs, as intimating that he shall always stand, and as not having any cause of corruption so that his body should fall.&#160; And he neither says that the God who created the world is the Supreme, nor does he believe that the dead will be raised.&#160; He rejects Jerusalem, and substitutes Mount Gerizzim for it.&#160; Instead of our Christ, he proclaims himself.&#160; The things of the law he explains by his own presumption; and he says, indeed, that there is to be a judgment, but he does not expect it.&#160; For if he were persuaded that he shall be judged by God, he would not dare be impious towards God Himself.&#160; Whence some not knowing that, using religion as a cloak, he spoils the things of the truth, and faithfully believing the hope and the judgment which in some way he says are to be, are ruined.</p>
