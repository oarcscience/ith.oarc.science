<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xx-p2"></A>&#8220;Peace be to all of you who are prepared to give your right hands to truth:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">614</FONT></A>
&#160; for whosoever are obedient to it seem indeed themselves to confer some favour upon God; whereas they do themselves obtain from Him the gift of His greatest bounty, walking in His paths of righteousness.&#160; Wherefore the first duty of all is to inquire into the righteousness of God and His kingdom;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">615</FONT></A>
 His righteousness, that we may be taught to act rightly; His kingdom, that we may know what is the reward appointed for labour and patience; in which kingdom there is indeed a bestowal of eternal good things upon the good, but upon those who have acted contrary to the will of God, a worthy infliction of penalties in proportion to the doings of every one.&#160; It becomes you, therefore, whilst you are here,&#8212;that is, whilst you are in the present life,&#8212;to ascertain the will of God, while there is opportunity also of doing it.&#160; For if any one, before he amends his doings, wishes to investigate concerning things which he cannot discover, such investigation will be foolish and ineffectual.&#160; For the time is short, and the judgment of God shall be occupied with deeds, not questions.&#160; Therefore before all things let us inquire into this, what or in what manner we must act that we may merit to obtain eternal life.</p>
