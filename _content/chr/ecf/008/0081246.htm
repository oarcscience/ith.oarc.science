 and used to make ploughs and ox-yokes.&#160; And one day a rich man <A NAME="page_403"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 403</FONT></A> <a name="vii.x.xi-Page_403"></A>said to Joseph:&#160; Master, make me a couch, both useful and beautiful.&#160; And Joseph was in distress, because the wood which he had brought&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1770"></A><A HREF="#fn_1770"><FONT SIZE="1">1771</FONT></A>
 for the work was too short.&#160; And Jesus said to him:&#160; Do not be annoyed.&#160; Take hold of this piece of wood by one end, and I by the other; I and let us draw it out.&#160; And they did so; and immediately he found it useful for that which he wished.&#160; And He said to Joseph:&#160; Behold, do the work which thou wishest.&#160; And Joseph, seeing what He had done, embraced Him, and said:&#160; Blessed am I, because God hath given me such a son.</p>
