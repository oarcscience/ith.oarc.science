<p class="c51"><a name="viii.viii.iii.v-p2"></A>Of the case of any one bringing forward a charge in passion, or failing to prove his allegations.</p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="viii.viii.iii.v-p3"></A>If, then, any one in passion brings a charge rashly against any one, mere abuse is not to be taken for an accusation.&#160; But a certain time being allowed for dealing with the matter, the person should profess his ability in writing to prove what he has alleged in passion; so that, if he should happen to think better of the things he uttered in passion, and decline to repeat or write them, the person may not be held as charged with the crime.&#160; Every one, therefore, who adduces a charge, ought to state in writing his ability to prove it.&#160; And, indeed, a cause should always be dealt with in the place where the charge is admitted; and the man who fails to substantiate his allegation, should himself bear the penalty which he advanced.</p>
