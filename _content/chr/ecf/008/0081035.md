id="vi.iv.xvii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Old Man Gives
Information in Regard to Faustus the Father of Clement.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.viii-p2"></span>“When the old man had thus spoken,
I knew from what he said that the old man who he stated had died, was no
other than your father.  I did not wish, however, to communicate your
circumstances to him until I should confer with you.  But I ascertained
where his lodging was, and I pointed out mine to him; and to make sure
*that my conjecture was right*, I put this one question to him:  ‘What
was the name of the old man?’  And he said, ‘Faustus.’  ‘And what were
the names of his twin sons?’  And he answered, ‘Faustinus and
Faustinianus.’  ‘What was the name of the third son?’  He said,
‘Clement.’  ‘What was their mother’s name?’  He said, ‘Mattidia.’ 
Accordingly, from compassion, I shed tears along with him, and,
dismissing the multitudes, I came to you, in order that I might take
counsel with you after we had partaken of food <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208) together.  But I did not wish to
disclose the matter to you before we had partaken of food, lest
perchance you should be overcome by sorrow, and continue sad on the day
of baptism, when even angels rejoice.”  At these statements of Peter we
all fell a weeping along with our mother.  But he beholding us in tears,
said:  “Now let each one of you, through fear of God, bear bravely what
has been said:  for certainly it was not to-day that your father died,
but long ago, as you conjecturing said.”
