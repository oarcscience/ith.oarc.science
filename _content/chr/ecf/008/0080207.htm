<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.lxx-p2"></A>To this Simon replied:&#160; &#8220;It is a great thing which you promise, that the eternity of boundless light can be shown from the law.&#8221;&#160; And when Peter said, &#8220;I shall show it whenever you please,&#8221; Simon answered:&#160; &#8220;Since now it is a late hour, I shall stand by you and oppose you to-morrow; and if you can prove that this world was created, and that souls are immortal, you shall have me to assist you in your preaching.&#8221;&#160; When he had said thus, he departed, and was followed by a third part of all the people who had come with him, who were about one thousand men.&#160; But the rest with bended knees prostrated themselves before Peter; and he, invoking upon them the name of God, cured some who had demons, healed others who were sick, and so dismissed the people rejoicing, commanding them to come early the next day.&#160; But Peter, when the crowds had withdrawn, commanded the table to be spread on the ground, in the open air, in the court where the disputation had been held, and sat down together with those eleven; but I dined reclining with some others who also had made a beginning of hearing the word of God, and were greatly beloved.</p>
