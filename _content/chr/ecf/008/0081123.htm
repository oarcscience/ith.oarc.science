<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.iv-p2"></A>And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;It must be so.&#8221;&#160; And Simon:&#160; &#8220;Therefore, if he is originated, he has been made by that very God who made all things, being either born as an animal, or sent forth substantially, and resulting from an external mixture <i>of elements</i>.&#160; For either&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1415"></A><A HREF="#fn_1415"><FONT SIZE="1">1416</FONT></A>
