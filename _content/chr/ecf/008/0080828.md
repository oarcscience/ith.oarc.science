<span id="vi.iv.ix.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—All Such Stories are
Allegorical.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.x-p2"></span>“And I must ask you to think of all such
stories as embodying some such allegory.  Look on Apollo as the
wandering Sun (<span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.x-p2.1"></span>peri-polôn</span>), a son of Zeus, who was
also called Mithras, as completing the period of a year.  And these said
transformations of the all-pervading Zeus must be regarded as the
numerous changes of the seasons, while his numberless wives you must
understand to be years, or generations.  For the power which proceeds
from the æther and passes through the air unites with all the years and
generations in turn, and continually varies them, and so produces or
destroys the crops.  And ripe fruits are called his children, the
barrenness of some seasons being referred to unlawful unions.”
