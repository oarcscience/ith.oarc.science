id="vi.iv.xii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Zoroaster.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.iv-p2"></span>“Of this family there was born in due
time a certain one, who took up with magical practices, by name Nebrod,
who chose, giant-like, to devise things in opposition to God.  Him the
Greeks have called Zoroaster.  He, after the deluge, being ambitious of
sovereignty, and being a great magician, by magical arts compelled the
world-guiding star of the wicked one who now rules, to the bestowal of
the sovereignty *as a gift* from him.  But he, <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1110](#fn_1109) being a prince, <span
id="page_276">p. 276</span> <span id="vi.iv.xii.iv-Page_276"></span>and
having authority over him who compelled him, <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[1111](#fn_1110) wrathfully poured out the fire of
the kingdom, that he might both bring to allegiance, and might punish
him who at first constrained him.
