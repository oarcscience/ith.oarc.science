id="vii.x.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—How Jesus Was Handed Over to
Learn His Letters.</span>

<span id="vii.x.xii-p2"></span>And Joseph, seeing that He had such
favour, and that He was increasing in stature, thought it right to take
Him to learn His letters.  And he handed Him over to another teacher to
be taught.  And that teacher said to Joseph:  What letters dost thou
wish me to teach that boy?  Joseph answered and said:  First teach him
the Gentile letters, and then the Hebrew.  For the teacher knew that He
was very intelligent, and willingly took Him in hand.  And writing for
Him the first line, which is A and B, he taught Him for some
hours. <span id="fr_1771"></span>[1772](#fn_1771)   But Jesus was
silent, and made him no answer.  Jesus said to the master:  If thou art
indeed a master, and if thou indeed knowest the letters, tell me the
power <span id="fr_1772"></span>[1773](#fn_1772) of the A, and I shall
tell thee the power of the B.  Then His master was filled with fury, and
struck Him on the head.  And Jesus was angry, and cursed him; and he
suddenly fell down, and died.

<span id="vii.x.xii-p5"></span>And Jesus returned home.  And Joseph gave
orders to Mary His mother, not to let Him go out of the court of his
house.
