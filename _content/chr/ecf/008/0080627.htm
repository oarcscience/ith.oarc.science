<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xvii-p2"></A>Then I set forth my purpose from the beginning, and how I had spent myself upon difficult questions, and all the things that I disclosed to you at the outset, so that I need not write the same things again.&#160; Then I said, &#8220;I hold myself in readiness to journey with you; for this, I know not how, I gladly wish.&#160; However, I wish first to be convinced concerning the truth, that I may know whether the soul is mortal or immortal; and whether, if it is eternal, it is to be judged concerning the things which it hath done here.&#160; Also, whether there is anything that is righteous and well-pleasing to God; and whether the world was made, and for what end it was made; and whether it shall be dissolved; and if it shall be dissolved, whether it shall be made better, or shall not be at all.&#8221;&#160; And not to mention them in detail, I said that I wished to learn these things, and things consequent upon these.&#160; And to this he answered:&#160; &#8220;I shall shortly convey to you, O Clement, the knowledge of the things that are; and even now listen.</p>
