<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xxix-p2"></A>&#8220;But perhaps some of you will say, God has no care of human things; and if we cannot even attain to the knowledge of Him, how shall we attain to His friendship?&#160; That God does concern Himself with the affairs of men, His government of the world bears witness:&#160; for the sun daily waits upon it, the showers minister to it; the fountains, rivers, winds, and all elements, attend upon it; and the more these things become known to men, the more do they indicate God&#146;s care over men.&#160; For unless by the power of the Most High, the more powerful would never minister to the inferior; and by this God is shown to have not only a care over men, but some great affection, since He has deputed such noble elements to their service.&#160; But that men may also attain to the friendship of God, is proved to us by the example of those to whose prayers He has been so favourable, that He has withheld the heaven from rain when they wished, and has again opened it when they prayed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_767"></A><A HREF="#fn_767"><FONT SIZE="1">768</FONT></A>
&#160; And many other things He has bestowed upon those who does His will, which could not be bestowed but upon His friends.&#160; But you will say, What harm is done to God if these things also are worshipped by us?&#160; If any one of you should pay to another the honour that is due to his father, from whom he has received innumerable benefits, and should reverence a stranger and foreigner as his father, should you not think that he was undutiful towards his father, and most deserving to be disinherited?</p>
