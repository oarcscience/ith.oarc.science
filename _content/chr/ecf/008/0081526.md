Palestine.</span>

<span id="x.xii-p2"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.xii-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 180.\]  When Eusebius says that the
churches of “all Asia” concurred in the Ephesine use concerning the
Paschal, he evidently means Asia Minor, as in the Scriptures and
elsewhere. <span id="fr_3783"></span>[3784](#fn_3783)   Throughout “the
rest of the world,” he testifies, however, that such was not the use. 
The Palestinian bishops, after the Jewish downfall, seem to have been
the first to comprehend the propriety of adopting the more Catholic
usage; and our author presided over a council in Cæsarea, of which he
was bishop, assisted by Narcissus, bishop of Jerusalem, with Cassius of
Tyre and Clarus of Ptolemais, which confirmed it.  It is to be noted,
that Alexandria is cited by Theophilus as authority for this custom; and
it is not quite correct to say that the *Western* usage prevailed at
Nicæa, for it was the general use, save only in Asia Minor and churches
which were colonies of the same.  This fact has been overlooked, and is
very important, in history.

our epistle among all the churches, so that those who easily deceive
their own souls may not be able to lay the blame on us.  We would have
you know, too, that in Alexandria <span
id="fr_3785"></span>[3786](#fn_3785) also they observe *the festival* on
the same day as ourselves.  For the *Paschal* letters are sent from us
to them, and from them to us:  so that we observe the holy day in unison
and together.
