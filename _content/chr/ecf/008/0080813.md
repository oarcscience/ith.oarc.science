id="vi.iv.viii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Close of the
Answer.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xxvi-p2"></span>“‘For our mind, whenever it is
impressed delightfully with the image of a beloved one, always seeing
the form as in a mirror, is tormented by the recollection; and if it do
not obtain its desire, it contrives ways of obtaining it; but if it do
obtain it, it is rather increased, like fire having a supply of wood,
and especially when there is no fear impressed upon the soul of the
lover before the rise of passion.  For as water extinguishes fire, so
fear is the extinguisher of unreasonable desire.  Whence I, having
learned from a certain Jew both to understand and to do the things that
are pleasing to God, am not to be entrapped into adultery by your lying
fables.  But may God help you in your wish and efforts to be chaste, and
afford a remedy to your soul burning with love.’
