id="vi.iv.xxiii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Appion and Athenodorus
Return in Quest of Faustus.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxiii.xxi-p2"></span>But Peter said:  “God arranges our
affairs in a most satisfactory manner; <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[1541](#fn_1540) for we have with us Annubion the
*astro*loger. <span id="fr_1541"></span>[1542](#fn_1541)   For when we
arrive at Antioch, he will in future discourse regarding genesis, giving
us his genuine opinions as a friend.”  Now when, after midnight, our
father hurried with those whom Peter had ordered to go along with him
and with Annubion to Antioch, which was near, early next day, before
Peter went forth to discourse, Appion and Athenodorus, who had convoyed
Simon, returned to Laodicea in search of our father.  But Peter,
ascertaining the fact, urged them to enter.  And when they came in and
sat down, and said, “Where is Faustus?” Peter answered:  “We know not;
for since the evening, when he went to you, he has not been seen by his
kinsmen.  But yesterday morning Simon came in search of him; and when we
made no reply to him, something seemed to come over him, <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1543](#fn_1542) for he called himself Faustus; but
not being believed, he wept and lamented, and threatened to kill
himself, and then rushed out in the direction of the sea.”

here; but there can scarcely be a doubt about the meaning.
