Astrology.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xix-p2"></span>“There are, in every country or
kingdom, laws imposed by men, enduring either by writing or simply
through custom, which no one easily transgresses.  In short, the first
Seres, who dwell at the beginning of the world, <span
id="fr_844"></span>[845](#fn_844) have a law not to know murder, nor
adultery, nor whoredom, and not to commit theft, and not to worship
idols; and in all that country, which is very large, there is neither
temple, nor image, nor harlot, nor adulteress, nor is any thief brought
to trial.  But neither is any man ever slain there; and no man’s liberty
of will is compelled, according to your doctrine, by the fiery star of
Mars, to use the sword for the murder of man; nor does Venus in
conjunction with Mars compel to adultery, although of course with them
Mars occupies the middle circle of heaven every day.  But amongst the
Seres the fear of laws is more powerful than the configuration of <span
