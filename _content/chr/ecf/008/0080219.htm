<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.ix-p2"></A>Then Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Does it not seem to you to be absurd that an unskilled people should sit in judgment upon our sayings?&#8221;&#160; Then Peter:&#160; &#8220;It is not so; for what perhaps is less clear to one, can be investigated by many, for oftentimes even a popular rumour has the aspect of a prophecy.&#160; But in addition to all this, all these people stand here constrained by the love of God, and by a desire to know the truth, and therefore all these are to be regarded as one, by reason of their affection being one and the same towards the truth; as, on the other hand, two are many and diverse, if they disagree with each other.&#160; But if you wish to receive an indication how all these people who stand before us are as one man, consider from their very silence and quietness how with all patience, as you see, they do honour to the truth of God, even before they learn it, for they have not yet learned the greater observance which they owe to it.&#160; Wherefore I hope, through the mercy of God, that He will accept the religious purpose of their mind towards Him, and will give the palm of victory to him who preaches the truth, that He may make manifest to them the herald of truth.&#8221;</p>
