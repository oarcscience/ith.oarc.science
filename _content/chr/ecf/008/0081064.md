id="vi.iv.xix.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Peter’s Explanation of the
Passage.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.xii-p2"></span>And Peter answered:  “One is He who
said to His Wisdom, ‘Let us make a man.’  But His Wisdom <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[1290](#fn_1289) was that with which He Himself
always rejoiced <span id="fr_1290"></span>[1291](#fn_1290) as with His
own spirit.  It is united as soul to God, but it is extended by Him, as
hand, fashioning the universe.  On this account, also, one man was made,
and from him went forth also the female.  And being a unity generically,
it is yet a duality, for by expansion and contraction the unity is
thought to be a duality.  So that I act rightly in offering up all the
honour to one God as to parents.”  And Simon said:  “What then?  Even if
the Scriptures say that there are other gods, will you not accept the
opinion?”
