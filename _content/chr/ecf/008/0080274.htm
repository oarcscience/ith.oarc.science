<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lxiv-p2"></A>Peter therefore ordered the letter to be read to the people; and after the reading of it, he addressed them and gave them full instructions about everything, but especially that they should obey Zacch&aelig;us, whom he had ordained bishop over them.&#160; Also he commended the presbyters and the deacons to the people, and not less the people to them.&#160; And then, announcing that he should spend the winter at Tripolis, he said:&#160; &#8220;I commend you to the grace of God, being about to depart to-morrow, with God&#146;s will.&#160; But during the whole three months which he spent at C&aelig;sarea, for the sake of instruction, whatever he discoursed of in the presence of the people in the day-time, he explained more fully and perfectly in the night, in private to us, as more faithful and completely approved by him.&#160; And at the same time he commanded me, because he understood that I carefully stored in my memory what I heard, to commit to writing whatever seemed worthy of record, and to send it to you, my lord James, as also I did, in obedience to his command.&#8221;</p>
