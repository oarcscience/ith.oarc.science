<p class="c35"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter 16.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p2"></A>And the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, when they heard these words from Joseph, became as dead, and fell to the ground, and fasted until the ninth hour.&#160; And Nicodemus, along with Joseph, exhorted Annas and Caiaphas, the priests and the Levites, saying:&#160; Rise up and stand upon your feet, and taste bread, and strengthen your souls, because to-morrow is the Sabbath of the Lord.&#160; And they rose up, and prayed to God, and ate and drank, and departed every man to his own house.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p3"></A>And on the Sabbath our teachers and the priests and Levites sat questioning each other, and saying:&#160; What is this wrath that has come upon us? for we know his father and mother.&#160; Levi, a teacher, says:&#160; I know that his parents fear God, and do not withdraw themselves from the prayers, and give the tithes thrice a year.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1852"></A><A HREF="#fn_1852"><FONT SIZE="1">1853</FONT></A>
&#160; And when Jesus was born, his parents brought him to this place, and gave sacrifices and burnt-offerings to God.&#160; And when the great teacher Symeon took him into his arms, he said, Now Thou sendest away Thy servant, Lord, according to Thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of all the peoples:&#160; a light for the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of Thy people Israel.&#160; And Symeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, I give thee good news about this child.&#160; And Mary said, It is well, my lord.&#160; And Symeon said to her, It is well; behold, he lies for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against; and of thee thyself a sword shall go through the soul, in order that the reasoning of many hearts may be revealed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1853"></A><A HREF="#fn_1853"><FONT SIZE="1">1854</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p6"></A>They say to the teacher Levi:&#160; How knowest thou these things?&#160; Levi says to them:&#160; Do you not know that from him I learned the law?&#160; The Sanhedrin say to him:&#160; We wish to see thy father.&#160; And they sent for his father.&#160; And they asked him; and he said to them:&#160; Why have you not believed my son?&#160; The blessed and just Symeon himself taught him the law.&#160; The Sanhedrin says to Rabbi Levi:&#160; Is the word that you have said true?&#160; And he said:&#160; It is true.&#160; And the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, said to themselves:&#160; Come, let us send into Galilee to the three men that came and told about his teaching and his taking up, and let them tell us how they saw him taken up.&#160; And this saying pleased all.&#160; And they sent away the three men who had already gone away into Galilee with them; and they say to them:&#160; Say to Rabbi Adas, and Rabbi Phinees, and Rabbi Haggai:&#160; Peace to you, and all who are with you!&#160; A great inquiry having taken place in the Sanhedrin, we have been sent to you to call you to this holy place, Jerusalem.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p7"></A>And the men set out into Galilee, and found them sitting and considering the law; and they saluted them in peace.&#160; And the men who were in Galilee said to those who had come to them:&#160; Peace upon all Israel!&#160; And they said:&#160; Peace to you!&#160; And they again said to them:&#160; Why have you come?&#160; And those who had been sent said:&#160; The Sanhedrin call you to the holy city Jerusalem.&#160; And when the men heard that they were sought by the Sanhedrin, they prayed to God, and reclined with the men, and ate and drank, and rose up, and set out in peace to Jerusalem.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p8"></A>And on the following day the Sanhedrin sat in the synagogue, and asked them, saying:&#160; Did <A NAME="page_425"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 425</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xii.xvii-Page_425"></A>you really see Jesus sitting on the mountain Mamilch teaching his eleven disciples, and did you see him taken up?&#160; And the men answered them, and said:&#160; As we saw him taken up, so also we said.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p9"></A>Annas says:&#160; Take them away from one another, and let us see whether their account agrees.&#160; And they took them away from one another.&#160; And first they call Adas, and say to him:&#160; How didst thou see Jesus taken up?&#160; Adas says:&#160; While he was yet sitting on the mountain Mamilch, and teaching his disciples, we saw a cloud overshadowing both him and his disciples.&#160; And the cloud took him up into heaven, and his disciples lay upon their face upon the earth.&#160; And they call Phinees the priest, and ask him also, saying:&#160; How didst thou see Jesus taken up?&#160; And he spoke in like manner.&#160; And they again asked Haggai, and he spoke in like manner.&#160; And the Sanhedrin said:&#160; The law of Moses holds:&#160; At the mouth of two or three every word shall be established.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1854"></A><A HREF="#fn_1854"><FONT SIZE="1">1855</FONT></A>
&#160; Buthem, a teacher, says:&#160; It is written in the law, And Enoch walked with God, and is not, because God took him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1855"></A><A HREF="#fn_1855"><FONT SIZE="1">1856</FONT></A>
&#160; Jairus, a teacher, said:&#160; And the death of holy Moses we have heard of, and have not seen it; for it is written in the law of the Lord, And Moses died from the mouth of the Lord, and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1856"></A><A HREF="#fn_1856"><FONT SIZE="1">1857</FONT></A>
&#160; And Rabbi Levi said:&#160; Why did Rabbi Symeon say, when he saw Jesus, &#8220;Behold, he lies for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1857"></A><A HREF="#fn_1857"><FONT SIZE="1">1858</FONT></A>
&#160; And Rabbi Isaac said:&#160; It is written in the law, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall go before thee to keep thee in every good way, because my name has been called upon him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1858"></A><A HREF="#fn_1858"><FONT SIZE="1">1859</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p15"></A>Then Annas and Caiaphas said:&#160; Rightly have you said what is written in the law of Moses, that no one saw the death of Enoch, and no one has named the death of Moses; but Jesus was tried before Pilate, and we saw him receiving blows and spittings on his face, and the soldiers put about him a crown of thorns, and he was scourged, and received sentence from Pilate, and was crucified upon the Cranium, and two robbers with him; and they gave him to drink vinegar with gall, and Longinus the soldier pierced his side with a spear; and Joseph our honourable father begged his body, and, as he says, he is risen; and as the three teachers say, We saw him taken up into heaven; and Rabbi Levi has given evidence of what was said by Rabbi Symeon, and that he said, Behold, he lies for the fall <i>and</i> rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against.&#160; And all the teachers said to all the people of the Lord:&#160; If this was from the Lord, and is wonderful in your eyes,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1859"></A><A HREF="#fn_1859"><FONT SIZE="1">1860</FONT></A>
 knowing you shall know, O house of Jacob, that it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth upon a tree.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1860"></A><A HREF="#fn_1860"><FONT SIZE="1">1861</FONT></A>
&#160; And another Scripture teaches:&#160; The gods which have not made the heaven and the earth shall be destroyed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1861"></A><A HREF="#fn_1861"><FONT SIZE="1">1862</FONT></A>
&#160; And the priests and the Levites said to each other:&#160; If his memorial be until the <i>year</i> that is called Jobel,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1862"></A><A HREF="#fn_1862"><FONT SIZE="1">1863</FONT></A>
 know that it shall it endure for ever, and he hath raised for himself a new people.&#160; Then the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, announced to all Israel, saying:&#160; Cursed is that man who shall worship the work of man&#146;s hand, and cursed is the man who shall worship the creatures more than the Creator.&#160; And all the people said, Amen, amen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1863"></A><A HREF="#fn_1863"><FONT SIZE="1">1864</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p21"></A>And all the people praised&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1864"></A><A HREF="#fn_1864"><FONT SIZE="1">1865</FONT></A>
 the Lord, and said:&#160; Blessed is the Lord, who hath given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He hath spoken; there hath not fallen one word of every good word of His that He spoke to Moses His servant.&#160; May the Lord our God be with us, as He was with our fathers:&#160; let Him not destroy us.&#160; And let Him not destroy us, that we may incline our hearts to Him, that we may walk in all His ways, that we may keep His commandments and His judgments which He commanded to our fathers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1865"></A><A HREF="#fn_1865"><FONT SIZE="1">1866</FONT></A>
&#160; And the Lord shall be for a king over all the earth in that day; and there shall be one Lord, and His name one.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1866"></A><A HREF="#fn_1866"><FONT SIZE="1">1867</FONT></A>
&#160; The Lord is our king:&#160; He shall save us.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1867"></A><A HREF="#fn_1867"><FONT SIZE="1">1868</FONT></A>
&#160; There is none like Thee, O Lord.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1868"></A><A HREF="#fn_1868"><FONT SIZE="1">1869</FONT></A>
&#160; Great art Thou, O Lord, and great is Thy name.&#160; By Thy power heal us, O Lord, and we shall be healed:&#160; save us, O Lord, and we shall be saved;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1869"></A><A HREF="#fn_1869"><FONT SIZE="1">1870</FONT></A>
 because we are Thy lot and heritage.&#160; And the Lord will not leave His people, for His great name&#146;s sake; for the Lord has begun to make us into His people.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1870"></A><A HREF="#fn_1870"><FONT SIZE="1">1871</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.xvii-p29"></A>And all, having sung praises, went away each man to his own house, glorifying God; for His is the glory for ever and ever.&#160; Amen.</p>
