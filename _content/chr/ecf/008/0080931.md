Idols.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xxiv-p2"></span>“Nor yet is that in harmony with
the illustration of Cæsar, and of the powers under him, to call them
administrators; whereas you take all care of them, as I said, tending
your images in every respect.  For they, having no power, do nothing. 
Wherefore tell us what do they administer? what do they of that sort
which rulers in different places do? and what influence do they exert,
as the stars of God?  Do they show anything like the sun, or do you
light lamps before them?  Are they able to bring showers, as the clouds
bring rain,—they which cannot even move themselves, unless men carry
them?  Do they make the earth fruitful to your labours, these to whom
you supply sacrifices?  Thus they can do nothing.
