<span id="vi.iv.viii.viii-p2"></span>“Then Appion, being really puzzled,
said:  ‘What am I to say to you?  For at one time, as one perturbed with
love, you pray to obtain her; and anon, as if you loved her not, you
make more account of your fear than your desire:  and you think that if
you can persuade her you shall be blameless, as without sin; but
obtaining her by the power of magic, you will incur punishment.  But do
you not know that it is the end of every action that is judged, the fact
that it has been committed, and that no account is made <span
id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span
id="vi.iv.viii.viii-Page_258"></span>of the means by which it has been
effected?  And if you commit adultery, being enabled by magic, shall you
be judged as having done wickedly; and if by persuasion, shall you be
absolved from sin in respect of the adultery?’  Then I said:  ‘On
account of my love, there is a necessity for me to choose one or other
of the means that are available to procure the object of my love; and I
shall choose, as far as possible, to cajole her rather than to use
magic.  But neither is it easy to persuade her by flattery, for the
woman is very much of a philosopher.’
