<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xlii-p2"></A>And they went away from Capernaum into the city which is called Bethlehem; and Joseph lived with Mary in his own house, and Jesus with them.&#160; And on a certain day Joseph called to him his first-born son James,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1687"></A><A HREF="#fn_1687"><FONT SIZE="1">1688</FONT></A>
 and sent him into the vegetable garden to gather vegetables for the purpose of making broth.&#160; And Jesus followed His brother James into the garden; but Joseph and Mary did not know this.&#160; And while James was collecting the vegetables, a viper suddenly came out of a hole and struck his hand,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1688"></A><A HREF="#fn_1688"><FONT SIZE="1">1689</FONT></A>
 and he began to cry out from excessive pain.&#160; And, becoming exhausted, he said, with a bitter cry:&#160; Alas! alas! an accursed viper has struck my hand.&#160; And Jesus, who was standing opposite to him, at the bitter cry ran up to James, and took hold of his hand; and all that He did was to blow on the hand of James, and cool it:&#160; and immediately James was healed, and the serpent died.&#160; And Joseph and Mary did not know what had been done; but at the cry of James, and the command of Jesus, they ran to the garden, and found the serpent already dead, and James quite cured.</p>
