Scriptures.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.ix-p2"></span>“Worthy, therefore, of rejection is
every one who is willing so much as to hear anything against the
monarchy of God; but if any one dares to hear anything against God, as
trusting in the Scriptures, let him first of all consider with me that
if any one, as he pleases, form a dogma agreeable to himself, and then
carefully search the Scriptures, he will be able to produce many
testimonies from them in favour of the dogma that he has formed.  How,
then, can confidence be placed in them against God, when what every man
wishes is found in them?
