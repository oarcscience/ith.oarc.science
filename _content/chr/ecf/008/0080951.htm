<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.xvii-p2"></A>&#8220;But you cannot speak thus; for you do not believe that things are then as we say; I mean, when there is a recompense for all.&#160; And on this account, you being ignorant of what is advantageous, are seduced by temporal pleasures from taking hold of eternal things.&#160; Wherefore we attempt to make to you exhibitions of what is profitable, that, being convinced of the promises that belong to piety, you may by good deeds inherit with us the griefless world.&#160; Until then you know us, do not be angry with us, as if we spoke falsely of the good things which we desire for you.&#160; For the things which are regarded by us as true and good, these we have not scrupled to bring to you, but, on the contrary, have hastened to make you fellow-heirs of good things, which we have considered to be such.&#160; For thus it is necessary to speak to the unbelievers.&#160; But that we really speak the truth in what we say, you cannot know otherwise than by first listening with love of the truth.</p>
