<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxi.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Simon Refuted.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.xiv-p2"></span>“But if, as you say, it will be
possible to know Him, because He is now revealed to all through
Jesus, <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383) are you not stating
what is most unjust, when you say that these men did not know Him, who
were the seven pillars of the world, and who were able to please the
most just God, and that so many now from all nations who were impious
know Him in every respect?  Were not those who were superior to every
one not deemed worthy to know Him? <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384)   And how can that be good which is
not just? unless you wish to give the name of ‘good,’ not to him who
does good to those who act justly, but to him who loves the unjust, even
though they do not believe, and reveals to them the secrets which he
would not reveal to the just.  But such conduct is befitting neither in
one who is good nor just, but in one who has come to hate the pious. 
Are not you, Simon, the standing one, who have the boldness to make
these statements which never have been so made before?”
