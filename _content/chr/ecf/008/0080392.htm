 my mother began to ask of me what had become of my father; and I told her that he had gone to seek her, and never returned.&#160; But she, hearing this, only sighed; for her great joy on my account lightened her other sorrows.&#160; And the next day she journeyed with us, sitting with Peter&#146;s wife; and we came to Balane&aelig;, where we stayed three days, and then went on to Pathos, and afterwards to Gabala; and so we arrived at Laodicea, where Niceta and Aquila met us before the gates, and kissing us, conducted us to a lodging.&#160; But Peter, seeing that it was a large and splendid city, said that it was worthy that we should stay in it ten days, or even longer.&#160; Then Niceta and Aquila asked of me who was this unknown woman; and I answered:&#160; &#8220;It is my mother, whom God has given back to me by means of my lord Peter.&#8221;</p>
