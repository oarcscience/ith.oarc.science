<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xi.iii-p2"></A>But awaking about the second cock-crowing, he found us astir.&#160; We were in all sixteen, viz., Peter himself, and I Clement, Nicetas and Aquila, and the twelve who had preceded us.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1087"></A><A HREF="#fn_1087"><FONT SIZE="1">1088</FONT></A>
&#160; Having therefore saluted us, he said, &#8220;To-day, <A NAME="page_271"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 271</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xi.iii-Page_271"></A>not being occupied with those without, we are free to be occupied with one another.&#160; Wherefore I shall tell you the things that happened after your departure from Tyre; and do you minutely relate to me what have been the doings of Simon here.&#8221;&#160; While, therefore, we were answering one another by narratives on either side, one of our friends entered, and announced to Peter that Simon, learning of his arrival, had set off for Syria, and that the multitudes, thinking this one night to be like a year&#146;s time, and not able to wait for the appointment which he had made, were standing before the doors conversing with one another in knots and circles about the accusation brought by Simon, and how that, having raised their expectations, and promised that he would charge Peter when he came with many evils, he had fled by night when he knew of his arrival.&#160; &#8220;However,&#8221; said he, &#8220;they are eager to hear you; and I know not whence some rumour has reached them to the effect that you are going to address them to-day.&#160; In order, therefore, that they may not when they are very tired be dismissed without reason, you yourself know what it is proper for you to do.&#8221;</p>
