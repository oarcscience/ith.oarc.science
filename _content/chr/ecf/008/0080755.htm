<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lxviii-p2"></A>&#8220;And let them inculcate marriage not only upon the young, but also upon those advanced in years, lest burning lust bring a plague upon the Church by reason of whoredom or adultery.&#160; For, above every other sin, the wickedness of adultery is hated by God, because it not only destroys the person himself who sins, but those also who eat and associate with him.&#160; For it is like the madness of a dog, because it has the nature of communicating its own madness.&#160; For the sake of chastity, therefore, let not only the elders, but even all, hasten to accomplish marriage.&#160; For the sin of him who commits adultery necessarily comes upon all.&#160; Therefore, to urge the brethren to be chaste, this is the first charity.&#160; For it is the healing of the soul.&#160; For the nourishment of the body is rest.</p>
