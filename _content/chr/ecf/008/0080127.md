id="vi.iii.iii.lxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXV.—Tumult Stilled by
Gamaliel.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxv-p2"></span>“When I had thus spoken, the whole
multitude of the priests were in a rage, because I had foretold to them
the overthrow of the temple.  Which when Gamaliel, a chief of the
people, saw—who was secretly our brother in the faith, but by our advice
remained among them—because they were greatly enraged and moved with
intense fury against us, he stood up, and said, <span
id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592) ‘Be quiet for a little, O men of
Israel, for ye do not perceive the trial which hangs over you. 
Wherefore refrain from these men; and if what they are engaged in be of
human counsel, it will soon come to an end; but if it be from God, why
will you sin without cause, and prevail nothing?  For who can overpower
the will of God?  Now therefore, since the day is declining towards
evening, I shall myself dispute with these men to-morrow, in this same
place, in your hearing, so that I may openly oppose and clearly confute
every error.’  By this speech of his their fury was to some extent
checked, especially in the hope that next day we should be publicly
convicted of error; and so he dismissed the people peacefully.”
