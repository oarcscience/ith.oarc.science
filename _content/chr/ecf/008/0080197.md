God.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lx-p2"></span>Then Peter said:  “You represent him
as weak enough.  For if, as you say, he is more powerful than all, it
can never be believed the weaker wrenched the spoils from the
stronger. <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666)   Or if God the
Creator was able by violence to bring down souls into this world, how
can it be that, when they are separated from the body and freed from the
bonds of captivity, the good God shall call them to the sufferance of
punishment, on the ground that they, either through his remissness or
weakness, were dragged away to this place, and were involved in the
body, as in the darkness of ignorance?  You seem to me not to know what
a father and a God is:  but I could tell you both whence souls are, and
when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to
disclose these things to you, who are in such error in respect of the
knowledge of God.”  Then said Simon:  “A time will come when you shall
be sorry that you did not understand me speaking of the ineffable
power.”  Then said Peter:  “Give us then, as I have often said, as being
yourself a new God, or as having yourself come down from him, some new
sense, by means of which we may know that new God of whom you speak; for
those five senses, which God our Creator has given us, keep faith to
their own Creator, and do not perceive that there is any other God, for
so their nature necessitates them.”
