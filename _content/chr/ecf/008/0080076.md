id="vi.iii.iii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—His Account of
Himself.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xiv-p2"></span>Having detailed to him what purpose
I had conceived from the beginning, and how I had been distracted with
vain inquiries, and all those things which at first I intimated to thee,
my lord James, so that I need not repeat the same things now, I
willingly agreed to travel with him; “for that,” said I, “is just what I
was most eagerly desirous of.  But first I should wish the scheme of
truth to be expounded to me, that I may know whether the soul is mortal
or immortal; and if immortal, whether it shall be brought into judgment
for those things which it does here.  Further, I desire to know what
that righteousness <span id="page_81">p. 81</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.xiv-Page_81"></span>is, which is pleasing to God; then,
further, whether the world was created, and why it was created, and
whether it is to be dissolved, and whether it is to be renovated and
made better, or whether after this there shall be no world at all; and,
not to mention everything, I should wish to be told what is the case
with respect to these and such like things.”  To this Peter answered, “I
shall briefly impart to you the knowledge of these things, O Clement: 
therefore listen.”
