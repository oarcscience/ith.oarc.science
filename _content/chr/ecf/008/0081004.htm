<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.xxxiii-p2"></A>But I, hearing this, said:&#160; &#8220;These things, indeed, it is impossible to do; but to do good to enemies, bearing all their insolences, I do not think can possibly be in human nature.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter answered:&#160; &#8220;You have said truly; for philanthropy, being the cause of immortality, is given for much.&#8221;&#160; Then I said, &#8220;How then is it possible to get it in the mind?&#8221;&#160; Then Peter answered:&#160; &#8220;O beloved Clement, the way to get it is this:&#160; if any one be persuaded that enemies, ill-using for a time those whom they hate, become the cause to them of deliverances from eternal punishment; and forthwith he will ardently love them as benefactors.&#160; But the way to get it, O dear Clement, is but one, which is the fear of God.&#160; For he who fears God cannot indeed from the first love his neighbour as himself; for such an order does not occur to the soul.&#160; But by the fear of God he is able to do the things of those who love; and thus, while he does the deeds of love, the bride Love is, as it were, brought to the bridegroom Fear.&#160; And thus this bride, bringing forth philanthropic thoughts, makes her possessor immortal, as an accurate image of God, which cannot be subject in its nature to corruption.&#8221;&#160; Thus while he expounded to us the doctrine of philanthropy, the evening having set in, we turned to sleep.</p>
