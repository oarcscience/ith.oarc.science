id="vi.iii.xii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Dead Men Deified.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxv-p2"></span>“But if they choose to argue, and
affirm that these are rather the places of their birth than of their
burial or death, the former and ancient doings shall be convicted from
those at hand and still recent, since we have shown that they worship
those whom they themselves confess to have been men, and to have died,
or rather to have been punished; as the Syrians worship Adonis, and the
Egyptians Osiris; the Trojans, Hector; Achilles is worshipped at
Leuconesus, Patroclus at Pontus, Alexander the Macedonian at Rhodes; and
many others are worshipped, one in one place and another in another,
whom they do not doubt to have been dead men.  Whence it follows that
their predecessors also, falling into a like error, conferred divine
honour upon dead men, who perhaps had had some power or some skill, and
especially if they had stupefied stolid men by magical phantasies. <span
