id="vi.iv.xiv.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Not Peace, But a
Sword.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xix-p2"></span>“Whence the Prophet of the truth,
knowing that the world was much in error, and seeing it ranged on the
side of evil, did not choose that there should be peace to it while it
stood in error.  So that till the end he sets himself against all those
who are in concord with wickedness, setting *truth* over against error,
sending as it were fire upon those who are sober, namely wrath against
the seducer, which is likened to a sword, <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131) and by holding forth the word he
destroys ignorance by knowledge, cutting, as it were, and separating the
living from the dead.  Therefore, while wickedness is being conquered by
lawful knowledge, war has taken hold of all.  For the submissive son is,
for the sake of salvation, separated from the unbelieving father, or the
father from the son, or the mother from the daughter, or the daughter
from the mother, and relatives from relatives, and friends from
associates.
