id="vii.xii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.xii-p2"></span>And it was about the sixth hour, and
there was darkness over the earth until the ninth hour, the sun being
darkened; and the <span id="page_421">p. 421</span> <span
id="vii.xii.xii-Page_421"></span>curtain of the temple was split in the
middle.  And crying out with a loud voice, Jesus said:  Father, <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.xii.xii-p2.1"></span>Baddach</span> <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.xii.xii-p2.2"></span>ephkid</span> <span
class="c9"><span id="vii.xii.xii-p2.3"></span>ruel</span>, which is,
interpreted:  Into Thy hands I commit my spirit. <span
id="fr_1836"></span>[1837](#fn_1836)   And having said this, He gave up
the ghost.  And the centurion, seeing what had happened, glorified God,
and said:  This was a just man.  And all the crowds that were present at
this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, beat their breasts and
went away.

<span id="vii.xii.xii-p4"></span>And the centurion reported what had
happened to the procurator.  And when the procurator and his wife heard
it, they were exceedingly grieved, and neither ate nor drank that day. 
And Pilate sent for the Jews, and said to them:  Have you seen what has
happened?  And they say:  There has been an eclipse of the sun in the
usual way. <span id="fr_1837"></span>[1838](#fn_1837)

<span id="vii.xii.xii-p6"></span>And His acquaintances were standing at
a distance, and the women who came with Him from Galilee, seeing these
things.  And a man named Joseph, a councillor from the city of
Arimathæa, who also waited for the kingdom of God, went to Pilate, and
begged the body of Jesus.  And he took it down, and wrapped it in clean
linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn out of the rock, in which no one had
ever lain.

scoundrels! is this the way you tell the truth about everything?  I know
that that never happens but at new moon.  Now you ate your passover
yesterday, the fourteenth of the month, and you say that it was an
eclipse of the sun.
