Divine Attributes.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xliii-p2"></span>“Wherefore, far be it from us to
believe that the Lord of all, who made the heaven and the earth, and all
things that are in them, shares His government with others, or that He
lies.  For if He lies, then who speaks truth?  Or that He makes
experiments as in ignorance; for then who foreknows?  And if He
deliberates, and changes His purpose, who is perfect in understanding
and permanent in design?  If He envies, who is above rivalry?  If He
hardens hearts, who makes wise?  If He makes blind and deaf, who has
given sight and hearing?  If He commits pilfering, who administers
justice?  If He mocks, who is sincere?  If He is weak, who is
omnipotent?  If He is unjust, who is just?  If He makes evil things, who
shall make good things?  If He does evil, who shall do good?
