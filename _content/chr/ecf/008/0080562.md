id="vi.iii.xii.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIV.—Excitement in
Antioch.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.liv-p2"></span>And while he was thus speaking, one
of those returned who had gone before to Antioch, and said to Peter:  “I
wish you to know, my lord Peter, that Simon at Antioch, doing many signs
and prodigies in public, has inculcated upon the people nothing but what
tends to excite hatred against you, calling you a magician, a sorcerer,
a murderer; and to such an extent has he stirred up hatred against you,
that they greatly desire, if they can find you anywhere, even to devour
your flesh.  And therefore we who were sent before, seeing the city
greatly moved against you, met together in secret, and considered what
ought to be done.
