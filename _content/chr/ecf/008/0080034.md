id="v.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Continuation of the Subject of
Mortification; Dignity of Persons Consecrated to God.</span>

<span id="v.iii.ix-p2"></span>He in whomsoever the Spirit of God is, is
in accord with the will of the Spirit of God; and, because he is in
accord with the Spirit of God, therefore does he mortify the deeds of
the body and live unto God, “treading down and subjugating the body and
keeping it under; so that, while preaching to others,” he may be a
beautiful example and pattern to believers, and may spend his life in
works which are worthy of the Holy Spirit, so that he may “not be cast
away,” <span id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371) but may be approved
before God and before men.  For in “the man who is of God,” <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372) with him *I say* there is nothing of
the mind of the flesh; and especially in virgins *of either sex*; but
the fruits of all of them are “the fruits of the Spirit” <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373) and of life, and they are truly the
city of God, and the houses and temples in which God abides and dwells,
and among which He walks, as in the holy city of heaven.  For in this
“do ye appear to the world as lights, in that ye give heed to the Word
of life,” <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374) and thus ye are in
truth the praise, and the boast, and the crown of rejoicing, and the
delight of good servants in our Lord Jesus Christ.  For all who see you
will “acknowledge that ye are the seed which the Lord hath
blessed;” <span id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375) in very deed a seed
honourable and holy, and “a priestly kingdom, a holy people, the people
of the inheritance,” <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376) the heirs
of the promises of God; *of* things which do not decay, nor wither; of
“that which eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and which hath
not come up into the heart of man; of that which God hath prepared for
those who love Him and keep His commandments.” <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377)
