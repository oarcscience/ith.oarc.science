id="vi.iii.iv.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Simon Magus, a Formidable
Antagonist.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.v-p2"></span>When Peter had thus spoken to us,
Niceta asks permission to say something to him; <span
id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604) and Peter having granted permission,
he says:  “With your pardon, I beseech you, my lord Peter, to hear me,
who am very anxious for thee, and who am afraid lest, in the contest
which you have in hand with Simon, you should seem to be overmatched. 
For it very frequently happens that he who defends the truth does not
gain the victory, since the hearers are either prejudiced, or have no
great interest in the better cause.  But over and above all this, Simon
himself is a most vehement orator, trained in the dialectic art, and in
the meshes of syllogisms; and what is worse than all, he is greatly
skilled in the magic art.  And therefore I fear, lest haply, being so
strongly fortified on every side, he shall be thought to be defending
the truth, whilst he is alleging falsehoods, in the presence of those
who do not know him.  For neither should we ourselves have been able to
escape from him, and to be converted to the Lord, had it not been that,
while we were his assistants, and the sharers of his errors, we had
ascertained that he was a deceiver and a magician.”
