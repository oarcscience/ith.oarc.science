<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.ii-p2"></A>&#8220;I know, indeed, that you are distressed at being told to do this, being separated from me by a space of two days.&#160; I would have you know, therefore, that we the persuaders love you the persuaded much more than you love us who have persuaded you.&#160; Therefore loving one another as we do by not unreasonably doing what we wish, let us provide, as much as in us lies, for safety.&#160; For I prefer, as you also know, to go into the more notable cities of the provinces, and to remain some days, and discourse.&#160; And for the present lead the way into the neighbouring Laodicea, and, after two or three days, so far as it depends upon my choice, I shall overtake you.&#160; And do you alone receive me at the gates, on account of the confusion, that thus we may enter along with you without tumult.&#160; And thence, in like manner, after some days&#146; stay, others in your stead will go forward by turns to the places beyond, preparing lodgings for us.&#8221;</p>
