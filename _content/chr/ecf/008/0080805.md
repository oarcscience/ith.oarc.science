id="vi.iv.viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—The Philosophers
Advocates of Adultery.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xviii-p2"></span>“‘But why?  Do not the celebrated
philosophers extol pleasure, and have they not had intercourse with what
women they would?  Of these the first was that teacher of Greece, of
whom Phœbus himself said, “Of all men, Socrates is the wisest.”  Does
not he teach that in a well-regulated state women should be
common? <span id="fr_1050"></span>[1051](#fn_1050) and did he not
conceal the fair Alcibiades under his philosopher’s gown?  And the
Socratic Antisthenes writes of the necessity of not abandoning what is
called adultery.  And even his disciple Diogenes, did not he freely
associate with Lais, for the hire of carrying her on his shoulders in
public?  Does not Epicurus extol pleasure?  Did not Aristippus anoint
himself with perfumes, and devote himself wholly to Aphrodite?  Does not
Zeno, intimating indifference, say that the deity pervades all things,
that it may be known to the intelligent, that with whomsoever a man has
intercourse, it is as with himself; and that it is superfluous to forbid
what are called adulteries, or intercourse with mother, or daughter, or
sister, or children.  And Chrysippus, in his erotic epistles, makes
mention of the statue in Argos, representing Hera and Zeus in an obscene
position.
