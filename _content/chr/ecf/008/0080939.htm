<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.v-p2"></A>&#8220;Can it therefore be said that, for the sake of piety towards God, ye worship every form, while in all things ye injure man who is really the image of God, committing murder, adultery, stealing, and dishonouring him in many other respects?&#160; But you ought not to do even one evil thing on account of which man is grieved.&#160; But now you do all things on account of which man is disheartened, for wrong is also distress.&#160; Wherefore you murder and spoil his goods, and whatever else you know which you would not receive from another.&#160; But you, being seduced by some malignant reptile to malice, by the suggestion of polytheistic doctrine, are impious towards the real image, which is man, and think that ye are pious towards senseless things.</p>
