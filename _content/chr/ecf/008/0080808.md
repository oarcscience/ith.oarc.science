id="vi.iv.viii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Answer to Appion’s
Letter.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xxi-p2"></span>“‘I wonder how, when you commend me
for wisdom, you write to me as to a fool.  For, wishing to persuade me
to your passion, you make use of examples from the mythologies of the
gods, that Eros is the eldest of all, as you say, and above all gods and
men, not being afraid to blaspheme, that you might corrupt my soul and
insult my body.  For Eros is not the leader of the gods,—he, I mean, who
has to do with lusts.  For if he lusts willingly, he is himself his own
suffering and punishment; and he who should suffer willingly could not
be a god.  But if against his will he lust for copulation, and,
pervading our souls as through the members of our bodies, is borne into
intermeddling with our minds, then he that impels him to love is greater
than he.  And again, he who impels him, being himself impelled by
another desire, another greater than he is found impelling him.  And
thus we come to an endless succession of lovers, <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[1052](#fn_1051) which is impossible.  Thus, neither
is there an impeller nor an impelled; but it is the lustful passion of
the lover himself, which is increased by hope and diminished by despair.
