<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.ii-p2"></A>&#8220;I wish you to know that those who, according to our arrangement, associate with Simon that they may learn his intentions, and submit them to us, so that we may be able to cope with his variety of wickedness, these men have sent to me, and informed me that Simon to-day is, as he arranged, prepared to come before all, and show from the Scriptures that He who made the heaven and the earth, and all things in them, is not the Supreme God, but that there is another, unknown and supreme, as being in an unspeakable manner God of gods; and that He sent two gods, one of whom is he who made the world, and the other he who gave the law.&#160; And these things he contrives to say, that he may dissipate the right faith of those who would worship the one and only God who made heaven and earth.</p>
