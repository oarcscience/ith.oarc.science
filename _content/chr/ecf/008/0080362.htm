<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.viii.xi-p2"></A>&#8220;Moreover, it is good, and tends to purity, also to wash the body with water.&#160; I call it good, not as if it were that prime good of the purifying of the mind, but because this of the washing of the body is the sequel of that good.&#160; For so also our Master rebuked some of the Pharisees and scribes, who seemed to be better than others, and separated from the people, calling them hypocrites, because they purified only those things which were seen of men, but left defiled and sordid their hearts, which God alone sees.&#160; To some therefore of them&#8212;not to all&#8212;He said, &#145;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and platter, but the inside is full of pollution.&#160; O blind Pharisees, first make clean what is within, and what is without shall be clean also.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_784"><FONT SIZE="1">785</FONT></A>
&#160; For truly, if the mind be purified by the light of knowledge, when once it is clean and clear, then it necessarily takes care of that which is without a man, that is, his flesh, that it also may be purified.&#160; But when that which is without, the cleansing of the flesh, is neglected, it is certain that there is no care taken of the purity of the mind and the cleanness of the heart.&#160; Thus therefore it comes to pass, that he who is clean inwardly is without doubt cleansed outwardly also, but not always that he who is clean outwardly is also cleansed inwardly&#8212;to wit, when he does these things that he may please men.</p>
