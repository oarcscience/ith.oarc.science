<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.viii.ix-p2"></A>&#8220;But you will perhaps say, What does the baptism of water contribute towards the worship of God?&#160; In the first place, because that which hath pleased God is fulfilled.&#160; In the second place, because, when you are regenerated and born again of water and of God, the frailty of your former birth, which you have through men, is cut off, and so at length you shall be able to attain salvation; but otherwise it is impossible.&#160; For thus hath the true prophet testified to us with an oath:&#160; &#145;Verily I say to you, That unless a man is born again of water, he shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_783"></A><A HREF="#fn_783"><FONT SIZE="1">784</FONT></A>
&#160; Therefore make haste; for there is in these waters a certain power of mercy which was borne upon them at the beginning, and acknowledges those who are baptized under the name of the threefold sacrament, and rescues them from future punishments, presenting as a gift to God the souls that are consecrated by baptism.&#160; Betake yourselves therefore to these waters, for they alone can quench the violence of the future fire; and he who delays to approach to them, it is evident that the idol of unbelief remains in him, and by it he is prevented from hastening to the waters which confer salvation.&#160; For whether you be righteous or unrighteous, baptism is necessary for you in every respect:&#160; for the righteous, that perfection may be accomplished in him, and he may be born again to God; for the unrighteous, that pardon may be vouchsafed him of the sins which he has committed in ignorance.&#160; Therefore all should hasten to be born again to God without delay, because the end of every one&#146;s life is uncertain.</p>
