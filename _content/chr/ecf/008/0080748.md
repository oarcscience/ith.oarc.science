id="vi.iv.vi.lxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXI.—Monarchy.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.lxi-p2"></span>“But if any one of those present,
being able to instruct the ignorance of men, shrink from it, thinking
only of his own ease, let him expect to hear this sentence:  ‘O wicked
and slothful servant, thou oughtest to have given my money to the
exchangers, and I at my coming should have got my own.  Cast out the
unprofitable servant into the outer darkness.’ <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[1022](#fn_1021)   And with good reason; ‘for,’ says
He, ‘it is thine, O man, to prove my words, as silver and money are
proved among the exchangers.’ <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1023](#fn_1022)
  Therefore the multitude of the faithful ought to obey some one, that
they may live in harmony.  For that which tends to the government of one
person, in the form of monarchy, enables the subjects to enjoy peace by
means of good order; but in case of all, through desire of ruling, being
unwilling to submit to one only, they must altogether fall by reason of
division.
