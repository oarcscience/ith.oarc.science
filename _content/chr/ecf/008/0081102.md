id="vi.iv.xxi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Simon Confesses His
Ignorance.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.vii-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “I confess I have
not understood what you mean by the expression, ‘You would do as they do
who know.’”  And Peter said:  “If you have not understood it, then you
cannot know the mind of every one; and if you are ignorant of this, then
you do not know those who are worthy of the revelation.  You are not the
Son, for <span id="fr_1377"></span>[1378](#fn_1377) the Son knows. 
Wherefore He reveals *Him* to whomsoever He wishes, because they are
worthy.”  And Simon said:  “Be not deceived.  I know those who are
worthy, and I am not the Son.  And yet I have not understood what
meaning you attach to the words, ‘He reveals *Him* to whomsoever He
wishes.’  But I said that I did not understand it, not because I did not
know it, but because I knew that those who were present did not
understand it, in order that you may state it more distinctly, so that
they may perceive what are the reasons why we are carrying on this
discussion.”  And Peter said:  “I cannot state the matter more clearly: 
explain what meaning you have attached to the words.”  And Simon said: 
“There is no necessity why I should state your opinions.”  And Peter
said:  “You evidently, Simon, do not understand it, and yet you do not
wish to confess, that you may not be detected in your ignorance, and
thus be proved not to be the standing Son.  For you hint this, though
you do not wish to state it plainly; and, indeed, I who am not a
prophet, but a disciple of the true Prophet, know well from the hints
you have given what your wishes are.  For you, though you do not
understand even what is distinctly said, wish to call yourself son in
opposition to us.”  And Simon said:  “I will remove every pretext from
you.  I confess I do not understand what can be the meaning of the
statement, ‘The Son reveals *Him* to whomsoever He wishes.’  State
therefore what is its meaning more distinctly.”
