id="vi.iii.i-p3.1"></span>The Recognitions of Clement.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span

D.D.\]</span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p5"></span> ————————————

<span id="vi.iii.i-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.i-p6.1"></span>The</span> *Recognitions of Clement* is a kind
of philosophical and theological romance.  The writer of the work seems
to have had no intention of presenting his statements as facts; but,
choosing the disciples of Christ and their followers as his principal
characters, he has put into their mouths the most important of his
beliefs, and woven the whole together by a thread of fictitious
narrative.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p7"></span>The *Recognitions* is one of a series; the
other members of which that have come down to us are the *Clementine
Homilies* and two *Epitomes*. <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p9"></span>The authorship, the date, and the
doctrinal character of these books have been subjects of keen discussion
in modern times.  Especial prominence has been given to them by the
Tübingen school.  Hilgenfeld says:  “There is scarcely a single writing
which is of so great importance for the history of Christianity in its
first stage, and which has already given such brilliant disclosures at
the hands of the most renowned critics in regard to the earliest history
of the Christian Church, as the writings ascribed to the Roman Clement,
the *Recognitions* and *Homilies*.” <span
id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521)   The importance thus attached to
these strange and curious documents by one school of theologians, has
compelled men of all shades of belief to investigate the subject; but
after all their investigations, a great variety of opinion still
prevails on almost every point connected with these books.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p11"></span>We leave our readers to judge for
themselves in regard to the doctrinal statements, and confine ourselves
to a notice of some of the opinions in regard to the authorship and date
of the *Recognitions*. <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p13"></span>The first question that suggests itself
in regard to the *Recognitions* is, whether the *Recognitions* or the
*Homilies* are the earliest form of the book, and what relation do they
bear to each other?  Some maintain that they are both the productions of
the same author, and that the one is a later and altered edition of the
other; and they find some confirmation of this in the preface of
Rufinus.  Others think that both books are expansions of another work
which formed the basis.  And others maintain that the one book is a
*rifacimento* of the other by a different hand.  Of this third party,
some, like Cave, Whiston, Rosenmüller, Staüdlin, Hilgenfeld, and many
others, believe that the *Recognitions* was the earliest <span
id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523) of the two forms; while others, as
Clericus, Möhler, Lücke, Schliemann, and Uhlhorn, give priority to the
*Clementines*.  Hilgenfeld supposes that the original writing was the
<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iii.i-p14.1"></span>Κήρυγμα
Πέτρου</span>, which still remains in the work; that besides this there
are three parts,—one directed against Basilides, the second the *Travels
of Peter* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i-p14.2"></span>περίοδοι</span>) and the third the
*Recognitions*.  There are also, he believes, many interpolated passages
of a much later date than any of these parts. <span
id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p16"></span><span id="page_74">p. 74</span> <span
id="vi.iii.i-Page_74"></span>No conclusion has been reached in regard to
the author.  Some have believed that it is a genuine work of Clement. 
Whiston maintained that it was written by some of his hearers and
companions.  Others have attributed the work to Bardesanes.  But most
acknowledge that there is no possibility of discovering who was the
author.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p17"></span>Various opinions exist as to the date of
the book.  It has been attributed to the first, second, third, and
fourth centuries, and some have assigned even a later date.  If we were
to base our arguments on the work as it stands, the date assigned would
be somewhere in the first half of the third century.  A passage from the
*Recognitions* is quoted by Origen <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525) in his *Commentary on Genesis*,
written in 231; and mention is made in the work of the extension of the
Roman franchise to all nations under the dominion of Rome,—an event
which took place in the region of Caracalla, <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.i-p18.1"></span>a.d.</span> 211.  The *Recognitions* also
contains a large extract from the work *De Fato*, ascribed to
Bardesanes, but really written by a scholar of his.  Some have thought
that Bardesanes or his scholar borrowed from the *Recognitions*; but
more recently the opinion has prevailed, that the passage was not
originally in the *Recognitions*, but was inserted in the *Recognitions*
towards the middle of the third century, or even later. <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p20"></span>Those who believe the work made up of
various documents assign various dates to these documents.  Hilgenfeld,
for instance, believes that the <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iii.i-p20.1"></span>Κήρυγμα Πέτρου</span> was written before the
time of Trojan, and the *Travels of Peter* about the time of his reign.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p21"></span>Nothing is known of the place in which
the *Recognitions* was written.  Some, as Schliemann, have supposed
Rome, some Asia Minor, and recently Uhlhorn has tried to trace it to
Eastern Syria. <span id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p23"></span>The Greek of the *Recognitions* is lost. 
The work has come down to us in the form of a translation by Rufinus of
Aquileia (*d*. 410 <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.i-p23.1"></span>a.d.). </span> In his letter to Gaudentius,
Rufinus states that he omitted some portions difficult of comprehension,
but that in regard to the other parts he had translated with care, and
an endeavour to be exact even in rendering the phraseology.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p24"></span>The best editions of the *Recognitions*
are those by Cotelerius, often reprinted, and by Gersdorf, Lipsiæ, 1838;
but the text is not in a satisfactory condition.

\[Despite the morbid taste of this school for heretical writings, and
the now proven incorrectness of the “tendency-theory,” due credit must
be given to Baur and his followers for awakening a better critical
discernment among the students of ecclesiastical history.  Hilgenfeld’s
judgments, in the higher and lower criticism also, are frequently very
incorrect; but he has done much to further a correct estimate of the
*Clementina*.  See Introductory Notice, *supra*.—R.\]

\[Schaff thinks “the *Homilies* probably originated in East Syria, the
Recognitions in Rome.”  But Rufinus gives no intimation of the Roman
origin of the Greek work he translated.  Still, the apparently more
orthodox character of the *Recognitions* suggests an editor from the
Western Church.—R.\]
