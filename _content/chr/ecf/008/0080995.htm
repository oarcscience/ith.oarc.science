<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.xxiv-p2"></A>And then Peter having discoursed concerning God and the service accorded to Him, he concluded as follows:&#160; &#8220;If any one wishes to learn these things accurately, let him come to Antioch, where I have resolved to remain some length of time, and learn the things that pertain to his salvation.&#160; For if you are familiar with leaving your country for the sake of trading or of warfare, and coming to far-off places, you should not be unwilling to go three days&#146; journey for the sake of eternal salvation.&#8221;&#160; Then, after the address of Peter, I presented the woman who had been healed, in the presence of all the multitude, with a thousand drachmas, for her support, giving her in charge to a certain good man, who was the chief man of the city, and who of his own accord joyfully undertook the charge.&#160; Further, having distributed money amongst many other women, and thanked those who at any time had comforted my mother, I sailed away to Antaradus, along with my mother, and Peter, and the rest of our companions; and thus we proceeded to our lodging.</p>
