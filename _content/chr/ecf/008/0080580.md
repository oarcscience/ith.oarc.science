<span id="vi.iii.xii.lxxii-p2"></span>Then I Clement, with my brothers
and our mother, spoke to our father, asking him whether any remnants of
unbelief remained in him.  And he said:  “Come, and you shall see, in
the presence of Peter, what an increase of faith has grown in me.”  Then
Faustinianus approached, and fell down at Peter’s feet, saying:  “The
seeds of your word, which the field of my mind has received, are now
sprung up, and have so advanced to fruitful maturity, that nothing is
wanting but that you separate me from the chaff by that spiritual
reaping-hook of yours, and place me in the garner of the Lord, making me
partaker of the divine table.”  Then Peter, with all alacrity grasping
his hand, presented him to me Clement, and my brothers, saying:  “As God
has restored your sons to you, their father, so also your sons restore
their father to God.”  And he proclaimed a fast to all the people, and
on the next Lord’s day he baptized him; and in the midst of the people,
taking occasion from his conversion, he related all his fortunes, so
that the whole city received him as an angel, and paid him no less
honour than they did to the apostle. <span

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lxxii-Page_211"></span>*And these things being
known, Peter ordered the people to meet on the following day; and having
ordained one of his followers as bishop, and others as presbyters, he
baptized also a great number of people, and restored to health all who
had been distressed with sicknesses.* <span

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lxxii-p3"></span> \[The work probably closes with
these words; the added sentence is not in harmony with the general plan
of the *Recognitions*, which skilfully treats the material so as to give
prominence to the family of Clement.  Some scribe, zealous for the
authority of the Apostle Peter, has doubtless contributed the
unnecessary sentence which follows.  See next note.  The ordination of a
bishop at Antioch by Peter is simply an absurdity.  It is unlikely that
even the writer of the *Recognitions* would venture to ignore the
previous existence of a Christian church in that city.—R.\]
