<span id="vi.iv.xiii.iii-p2"></span>While he was thus discoursing to us,
there entered one of our people, who had been appointed to make the
following announcement to him, and said:  “My lord Peter, there are
great multitudes standing before the doors.”  With his consent,
therefore, a great multitude entered.  Then he rose up, and stood on the
basis, as he had done the day before; and having saluted them in
religious fashion, he said:  “God having formed the heaven and the
earth, and having made all things in them, as the true Prophet has said
to us, man, being made after the image and likeness of God, was
appointed to be ruler and lord of things, I say, in air and earth and
water, as may be known from the very fact that by his intelligence he
brings down the creatures that are in the air, and brings up those that
are in the deep, hunts those that are on the earth, and that although
they are much greater in strength than he; I mean elephants, and lions,
and such like.
