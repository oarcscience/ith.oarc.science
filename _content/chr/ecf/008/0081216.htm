<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xxxix-p2"></A>And it came to pass a second time, that Joseph and Mary were asked by the people that Jesus should be taught His letters in school.&#160; They did not refuse to do so; and according to the commandment of the elders, they took Him to a master to be instructed in human learning.&#160; Then the master began to teach Him in an imperious tone, saying:&#160; Say Alpha.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1684"></A><A HREF="#fn_1684"><FONT SIZE="1">1685</FONT></A>
&#160; And Jesus said to him:&#160; Do thou tell me first what Betha is, and I will tell thee what Alpha is.&#160; And upon this the master got angry and struck Jesus; and no sooner had he struck Him, than he fell down dead.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.xxxix-p4"></A>And Jesus went home again to His mother.&#160; And Joseph, being afraid, called Mary to him, and said to her:&#160; Know of a surety that my soul is sorrowful even unto death on account of this child.&#160; For it is very likely that at some time or other some one will strike him in malice, and he will die.&#160; But Mary answered and said:&#160; O man of God! do not believe that this is possible.&#160; You may believe to a certainty that He who has sent him to be born among men will Himself guard him from all mischief, and will in His own name preserve him from evil.</p>
