<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.iii-p2"></A>&#8220;The old man began to speak as follows:&#160; &#145;When I saw you after you had bathed in the sea retire into the secret place, I went up and secretly watched what might be your object in entering into a secret place, and when I saw you pray, I retired;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1194"></A><A HREF="#fn_1194"><FONT SIZE="1">1195</FONT></A>
 but taking pity on you, I waited that I might speak with you when you came out, and prevail on you not to be led astray.&#160; For there is neither God nor providence; but all things are subject to Genesis.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1195"></A><A HREF="#fn_1195"><FONT SIZE="1">1196</FONT></A>
&#160; Of this I am fully assured in consequence of what I have myself endured, having for a long time made a careful study of the science.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1196"></A><A HREF="#fn_1196"><FONT SIZE="1">1197</FONT></A>
&#160; Do not therefore be deceived, my child.&#160; For whether you pray or not, you must endure what is assigned to you by Genesis.&#160; For if prayers could have <A NAME="page_306"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 306</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xvii.iii-Page_306"></A>done anything or any good, I myself should now be in better circumstances.&#160; And now, unless my needy garments mislead you, you will not refuse to believe what I say.&#160; I was once in affluent circumstances; I sacrificed much to the gods, I gave liberally to the needy; and yet, though I prayed and acted piously, I was not able to escape my destiny.&#146;&#160; And I said:&#160; &#145;What are the calamities you have endured?&#146;&#160; And he answered:&#160; &#145;I need not tell you now; perhaps at the end you shall learn who I am, and who are my parents, and into what straitened circumstances I have fallen.&#160; But at present I wish you to become fully assured that everything is subject to Genesis.&#146;</p>
