<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.xv-p2"></A>&#8220;Let therefore the passengers remain quiet, sitting in their own places, lest by disorder they occasion rolling or careening.&#160; Let the midshipmen give heed to the fare.&#160; Let the deacons neglect nothing with which they are entrusted; let the presbyters, like sailors, studiously arrange what is needful for each one.&#160; Let the bishop, as the mate, wakefully ponder the words of the pilot alone.&#160; Let Christ, even the Saviour, be loved as the pilot, and alone believed in the matters of which He speaks; and let all pray to God for a prosperous voyage.&#160; Let those sailing expect every tribulation, as travelling over a great and troubled sea, the world:&#160; sometimes, indeed, disheartened, persecuted, dispersed, hungry, thirsty, naked, hemmed in; and, again, sometimes united, congregated, at rest; but also sea-sick, giddy, vomiting, that is, confessing sins, like disease-producing bile,&#8212;I mean the sins proceeding from bitterness, and the evils accumulated from disorderly lusts, by the confession of which, as by vomiting, you are relieved of your disease, attaining healthful safety by means of carefulness.</p>
