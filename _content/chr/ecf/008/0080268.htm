<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lviii-p2"></A>And when he had spoken at length on the subject of baptism, he dismissed the crowd, and betook himself to his usual place of abode; and there, while the twelve stood around him (viz. Zacch&aelig;us and Sophonias, Joseph and Mich&aelig;us, Eleazar and Phineas, Lazarus and Eliseus, I Clement and Nicodemus, Niceta and Aquila), he addressed us to the following effect:&#160; &#8220;Let us, my brethren, consider what is right; for it is our duty to bring some help to the nations, which are called to salvation.&#160; You have yourselves heard that Simon has set out, wishing to anticipate our journey.&#160; Him we should have followed step by step, that wheresoever he tries to subvert any, we might immediately confute him.&#160; But since it appears to me to be unjust to forsake those who have been already converted to God, and to bestow our care upon those who are still afar off, I think it right that I should remain three months with those in this city who have been turned to the faith, and should strengthen them; and yet that we should not neglect those who are still far off, lest haply, if they be long infected with the power of pernicious doctrine, it be more difficult to recover them.&#160; Therefore I wish (only, however, if you also think it right), that for Zacch&aelig;us, whom we have now ordained bishop, Benjamin the son of Saba be substituted; and for Clement (whom I have resolved to have always by me, because, coming from the Gentiles, he has a great desire to hear the word of God) there be substituted Ananias the son of Safra; and for Niceta and Aquila, who have been but lately converted to the faith of Christ, Rubelus the brother of Zacch&aelig;us, and Zacharias the builder.&#160; I wish, therefore, to complete the number of twelve by substituting these four for the other four, that Simon may feel that I in them am always with him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_713"></A><A HREF="#fn_713"><FONT SIZE="1">714</FONT></A>
