<span id="ix.xiii.vii-p3"></span>Answer to Abgar’s letter, which the
apostle Thomas wrote to this prince by command of the Saviour.

<span id="ix.xiii.vii-p4"></span>“Blessed is he who believes in me
without having seen me!  For it is written of me:  ‘Those who see me
will not believe in me, and those who do not see me will believe and
live.’  As to what thou hast written asking me to come to thee, I must
accomplish here all that for which I have been sent; and, when I shall
have accomplished it all, I shall ascend to Him who sent me; and when I
shall go away I will send one of my disciples, who will cure thy
diseases, and give life to thee and to all those who are with thee.” 
Anan, Abgar’s courier, brought him this letter, as well as the portrait
of the Saviour, a picture which is still to be found at this day in the
city of Edessa.
