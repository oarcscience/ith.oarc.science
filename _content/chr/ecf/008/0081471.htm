<p class="c51"><a name="ix.xiii.i-p8"></A>Reign of Abgar; Armenia becomes completely tributary to the Romans; war with Herod&#146;s troops; his brother&#146;s son, Joseph, is killed.</p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.xiii.i-p9"></A><span class="c9"><a name="ix.xiii.i-p9.1"></A>Abgar</span>, son of Archam, ascends the throne in the twentieth year of Archavir, king of the Persians.&#160; This Abgar was called Avak-air (great man), on account of his great gentleness and wisdom, and also on account of his size.&#160; Not being able to pronounce well, the Greeks and the Syrians called him Abgar.&#160; In the second year of his reign, all the districts of Armenia become tributary to the Romans.&#160; A command is given by the Emperor Augustus, as we are told in the Gospel of St. Luke, to number all the people in every part.&#160; Roman commissioners, sent for that purpose into Armenia, carried thither the statue of the Emperor Augustus, and set it up in all the temples.&#160; At this very time, our Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came into the world.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiii.i-p10"></A>At the same period there was trouble between Abgar and Herod:&#160; for Herod wished that his statue should be erected near to that of C&aelig;sar in the temples of Armenia.&#160; Abgar withstood this claim.&#160; Moreover, Herod was but seeking a pretext to attack Abgar:&#160; he sent an army of Thracians and Germans to make an incursion into the country of the Persians, with orders to pass through the territories of Abgar.&#160; But Abgar, far from submitting to this, resisted, saying that the emperor&#146;s command was to march the troops into Persia through the desert.&#160; Herod, indignant, and unable to act by himself, overwhelmed with troubles, as a punishment for his wicked conduct towards Christ, as Josephus relates, sent his nephew to whom he had given his daughter, who had been married in the first instance to Ph&eacute;ror, his brother.&#160; Herod&#146;s lieutenant, at the head of a considerable army, hastened to reach Mesopotamia, met Abgar at the camp in the province of Pouknan, fell in the combat, and his troops were put to flight.&#160; Soon afterwards, Herod died: Archelaus, his son, was appointed by Augustus ethnarch of Jud&aelig;a.</p>
