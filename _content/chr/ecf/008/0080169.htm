<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxxii-p2"></A>Then said Simon:&#160; &#8220;I am astonished at your folly.&#160; For you so propound the words of your Master, as if it were held to be certain concerning him that he is a prophet; while I can very easily prove that he often contradicted himself.&#160; In short, I shall refute you from those words which you have yourself brought forward.&#160; For you say, that he said that every kingdom or every city divided in itself shall not stand; and elsewhere you say, that he said that he would send a sword, that he might separate those who are in one house, so that son shall be divided from father, daughter from mother, brother from brother; so that if there be five in one house, three shall be divided against two, and two against three.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_626"></A><A HREF="#fn_626"><FONT SIZE="1">627</FONT></A>
&#160; If, then, everything that is divided falls, he who makes divisions furnishes causes of falling; and if he is such, assuredly he is wicked.&#160; Answer this if you can.&#8221;</p>
