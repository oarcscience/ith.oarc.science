<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.xx-p2"></A>&#8220;But one might with good reason maintain that it was with reference to those who thought Him to be such that the statement was made, &#145;No one knoweth the Father but the Son, as no one knoweth even the Son, but the Father.&#146;&#160; And reasonably.&#160; For if they had known, they would not have sinned, by trusting to the books written against God, really for the purpose of trying.&#160; But somewhere also He says, wishing to exhibit the cause of their error more distinctly to them, &#145;On this account ye do err, not knowing the true things of the Scriptures, on which account ye are ignorant also of the power of God.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1398"></A><A HREF="#fn_1398"><FONT SIZE="1">1399</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore every man who wishes to be saved must become, as the Teacher said, a judge of the books written to try us.&#160; For thus He spake:&#160; &#145;Become experienced bankers.&#146;&#160; Now the need of bankers arises from the circumstance that the spurious is mixed up with the genuine.&#8221;</p>
