<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xx.xx-p2"></A>When Simon heard this, he said:&#160; &#8220;Far be it from me to become his or your disciple.&#160; For I am not ignorant of what I ought to know; but the inquiries which I made as a learner were made that I may see if you can prove that actual sight is more distinct than apparition.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1367"></A><A HREF="#fn_1367"><FONT SIZE="1">1368</FONT></A>
&#160; But you spoke according to your own pleasure; you did not prove.&#160; And now, to-morrow I shall come to your opinions in regard to God, whom you affirmed to be the framer of the world; and in my discussion with you, I shall show that he is not the highest, nor good, and that your teacher made the same statements as I now do; and I shall prove that you have not understood him.&#8221;&#160; On saying this he went away, not wishing to listen to what might be said to the propositions which he had laid down.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iv.xx.xx-p3"></A> This passage is corrupt in the text.&#160; Dressel reads, &#8220;that activity is more distinct than apparition.&#8221;&#160; By activity would be meant, &#8220;acting while one is awake, and in full possession of his sense;&#8221; and thus the meaning would be nearly the same as in our translation.</p>
