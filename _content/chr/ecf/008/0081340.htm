<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvii.viii-p2"></A>And, behold, suddenly Hades trembled, and the gates of death and the bolts were shattered, and the iron bars were broken and fell to the ground, and everything was laid open.&#160; And Satan remained in the midst, and stood confounded and downcast, bound with fetters on his feet.&#160; And, behold, the Lord Jesus Christ, coming in the brightness of light from on high, compassionate, great, and lowly, carrying a chain in His hand, bound Satan by the neck; and again tying his hands behind him, dashed him on his back into Tartarus, and placed His holy foot on his throat, saying:&#160; Through all ages thou hast done many evils; thou hast not in any wise rested.&#160; To-day I deliver thee to everlasting fire.&#160; And Hades being suddenly summoned, He commanded him, and said:&#160; Take this most wicked and impious one, and have him in thy keeping even to that day in which I shall command thee.&#160; And he, as soon as he received him, was plunged under the feet of the Lord along with him into the depth of the abyss.</p>
