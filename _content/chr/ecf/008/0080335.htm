<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xxi-p2"></A>When Peter was speaking thus, all we who heard him laughed.&#160; Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;You laugh at the absurdities of others, because through long custom you do not see your own.&#160; For indeed it is not without reason that you laugh at the folly of the Egyptians, who worship dumb animals, while they themselves are rational.&#160; But I will tell you how they also laugh at you; for they say, We worship living animals, though mortal; but you worship and adore things which never were alive at all.&#160; They add this also, that they are figures and allegories of certain powers by whose help the race of men is governed.&#160; Taking refuge in this for shame, they fabricate these and similar excuses, and so endeavour to screen their error.&#160; But this is not the time to answer the Egyptians, and leaving the care of those who are present to heal the disease of the absent.&#160; For it is a certain indication that you are held to be free from sickness of this sort, since you do not grieve over it as your own, but laugh at it as that of others.</p>
