<span id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Peter Refuses to Discuss
Certain Questions in Regard to the Devil.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “Since, then, you
have honestly confessed, on the testimony of the Scriptures, that the
evil one exists, state to us how he has come into existence, if indeed
he has come into existence, and by whom, and why.” <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411)   And Peter said:  “Pardon me,
Simon, if I do not dare to affirm what has not been written.  But if you
say that it has been written, prove it.  But if, since it has not been
written, you cannot prove it, why should we run risk in stating our
opinions in regard to what has not been written?  For if we discourse
too daringly in regard to God, it is either because we do not believe
that we shall be judged, or that we shall be judged only in respect to
that which we do, but not also in regard to what we believe and
speak.” <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412)   But Simon,
understanding that Peter referred to his own madness, said:  “Permit me
to run the risk; but do not you make what you assert to be blasphemy a
pretext for retiring.  For I perceive that you wish to withdraw, in
order that you may escape refutation before the masses, sometimes as if
you were afraid to listen to blasphemies, and at other times by
maintaining that, as nothing has been written as to how, and by whom,
and why the evil one came into existence, we ought not to dare to assert
more than the Scripture.  Wherefore also as a pious man you affirm this
only, that he exists.  But by these contrivances you deceive yourself,
not knowing that, if it is blasphemy to inquire accurately regarding the
evil one, the blame rests with me, the accuser, and not with you, the
defender of God.  And if the subject inquired into is not in
Scripture, <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413) and on this
account you do not wish to inquire into it, there are some satisfactory
methods which can prove to you what is sought not less effectively than
the Scriptures.  For instance, must it not be the case that the evil
one, who you assert exists, is either originated or unoriginated?” <span

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p4"></span> This passage is probably corrupt. 
We have adopted the readings of Cotelerius—<span class="Greek"><span

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p6"></span> The words <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p6.1"></span>γενητός</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p6.2"></span>ἀγένητος</span> are
difficult to translate.  The first means one who has somehow or other
come into being; the second, one who has never *come* into being; but
has always been.  The <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p6.3"></span>mss.</span> confound <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p6.4"></span>γενητός</span> with
<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p6.5"></span>γεννητός</span>, begotten, and <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p6.6"></span>ἀγένητος</span> with
<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.iii-p6.7"></span>ἀγέννητος</span>, unbegotten.
