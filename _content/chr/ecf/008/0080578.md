<span id="vi.iii.xii.lxx-p2"></span>With such sayings, he went up on a
height, and ordered all the multitude of sick people to be ranged before
him, and addressed them all in these words:  “As you see me to be a man
like to yourselves, do not suppose that you can recover your health from
me, but through Him who, coming down from heaven, has shown to those who
believe in Him a perfect medicine for body and soul.  Hence let all this
people be witnesses to your declaration, that with your whole heart you
believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they may know that themselves
also may be saved by Him.”  And when all the multitude of the sick with
one voice cried out that He is the true God whom Peter preaches,
suddenly an overpowering light of the grace of God appeared in the midst
of the people; and the paralytics being cured, began to run to Peter’s
feet, the blind to shout on the recovery of their sight, the lame to
give thanks on regaining the power of walking, the sick to rejoice in
restored health; some even who were barely alive, being already without
consciousness or the power of speech, were raised up; and all the
lunatics, and those possessed of demons, were set free.
