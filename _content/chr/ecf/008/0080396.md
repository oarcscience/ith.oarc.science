id="vi.iii.ix.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—“Nothing Common or
Unclean.”</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxix-p2"></span>Therefore, when our mother had risen
from her sleep, Peter began to address her, saying:  “I wish you to
know, O woman, an observance of our religion.  We worship one God, who
made the world, and we keep His law, in which He commands us first of
all to worship Him, and to reverence His name, to honour our parents,
and to preserve chastity and uprightness.  But this also we observe, not
to have a common table with Gentiles, unless when they believe, and on
the reception of the truth are baptized, and consecrated by a certain
threefold invocation of the blessed name; and then we eat with
them. <span id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799)   Otherwise, even if it
were a father or a mother, or wife, or sons, or brothers, we cannot have
a common table with them.  Since, therefore, we do this for the special
cause of religion, let it not seem hard to you that your son cannot eat
with you, until you have the same judgment of the faith that he has.”
