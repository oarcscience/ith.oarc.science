<span id="vi.iii.iii.lx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.lx-p1.1"></span>Chapter LX.—Disciples of John
Refuted.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lx-p2"></span>“And, behold, one of the disciples of
John asserted that John was the Christ, and not Jesus, inasmuch as Jesus
Himself declared that John was greater than all men and all
prophets. <span id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588)   ‘If, then,’ said he,
‘he be greater than all, he must be held to be greater than Moses, and
than Jesus himself.  But if he be the greatest of all, then must he be
the Christ.’  To this Simon the Canaanite, answering, asserted that John
was indeed greater than all the prophets, and all who are born of women,
yet that he is not greater than the Son of man.  Accordingly Jesus is
also the Christ, whereas John is only a prophet:  and there is as much
difference between him and Jesus, as between the forerunner and Him
whose forerunner he is; or as between Him who gives the law, and him who
keeps the law.  Having made these and similar statements, the Canaanite
also was silent.  After him Barnabas, <span
id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589) who also is called Matthias, who was
substituted as an apostle in the place of Judas, began to exhort the
people that they should not regard Jesus with hatred, nor speak evil of
Him.  For it were far more proper, even for one who might be in
ignorance or in doubt concerning Jesus, to love than to hate Him.  For
God has affixed a reward to love, a penalty to hatred.  ‘For the very
fact,’ said he, ‘that He assumed a Jewish body, and was born among the
Jews, how has not this incited us all to love Him?’  When he had spoken
this, and more to the same effect, he stopped.”
