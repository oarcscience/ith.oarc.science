<p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.iv-p2"></A>It is glorious that Thomas the Israelite and apostle of the Lord gives an account also of the works of Jesus after He came out of Egypt into Nazareth.&#160; Understand all of you, my dearest brethren, what the Lord Jesus did when He was in the city of Nazareth; the first chapter of which is as follows:&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.x.iv-p3"></A>And when Jesus was five years old, there fell a great rain upon the earth, and the boy Jesus walked up and down through it.&#160; And there was a terrible rain, and He collected it into a fish-pond, and ordered it by His word to become clear.&#160; And immediately it became so.&#160; Again He took of the clay which was of that fish-pond, and made of it to the number of twelve sparrows.&#160; And it was the Sabbath when Jesus did this among the boys of the Jews.&#160; And the boys of the Jews went away, and said to Joseph His father:&#160; Behold, thy son was playing along with us, and he took clay and made sparrows, which it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath; and he has broken it.&#160; And Joseph went away to the boy Jesus, and said to Him:&#160; Why hast thou done this, which it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath?&#160; And Jesus opened His hands, and ordered the sparrows, saying:&#160; Go up into the air, and fly; nobody shall kill you.&#160; And they flew, and began to cry out, and praise God Almighty.&#160; And the Jews seeing what had hap<A NAME="page_401"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 401</FONT></A> <a name="vii.x.iv-Page_401"></A>pened, wondered, and went away and told the miracles which Jesus had done.&#160; But a Pharisee who was with Jesus took an olive branch, and began to let the water out of the fountain which Jesus had made.&#160; And when Jesus saw this, He said to him in a rage:&#160; Thou impious and ignorant Sodomite, what harm have my works the fountains of water done thee?&#160; Behold, thou shalt become like a dry tree, having neither roots, nor leaves, nor fruit.&#160; And immediately he dried up, and fell to the ground, and died.&#160; And his parents took him away dead, and reproached Joseph, saying:&#160; See what thy son has done; teach him to pray, and not to blaspheme.</p>
