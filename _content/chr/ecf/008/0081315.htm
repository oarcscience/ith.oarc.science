<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.xv-p2"></A>And Finees a certain priest, and Addas a teacher, and Egias a Levite, coming down from Galilee to Jerusalem, reported to the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites, how they had seen Jesus sitting, and his disciples with him, on the Mount of Olivet, which is called Mambre or Malech.&#160; And he said to his disciples:&#160; Go into all the world, and declare to every creature the Gospel of the kingdom of God.&#160; He who believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he who believeth not shall be condemned.&#160; And these signs shall follow them who believe:&#160; In my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak in new tongues; they <A NAME="page_445"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 445</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xv.xv-Page_445"></A>shall take up serpents; and if they have drunk any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands upon the sick, and they shall be well.&#160; And as Jesus was thus speaking to his disciples, we saw him taken up into heaven.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1965"></A><A HREF="#fn_1965"><FONT SIZE="1">1966</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.xv-p4"></A>The priests and the Levites and the elders say to them:&#160; Give glory to the God of Israel, and give confession to Him, whether you have both heard and seen those things which you have related.&#160; Those who had made the report say:&#160; As the Lord God of our fathers liveth, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, we have heard and seen.&#160; The Jews say to them:&#160; Have you come for this&#8212;to tell us? or have you come to give prayer to God?&#160; They said:&#160; We have come to give prayer to God.&#160; The elders and chief priests and Levites say to them:&#160; And if you have come to give prayer to God, why have you murmured before all the people about that foolish tale?&#160; Finees the priest, and Addas the teacher, and Egias the Levite, say to the rulers of the synagogue, and the priests and the Levites:&#160; If those words which we have spoken, which we have seen and heard, be sin, behold, we are in your presence; do unto us according to that which is good in your eyes.&#160; And they, taking the law, adjured them to report the words to no one thereafter.&#160; And they gave them to eat and drink, and put them outside of the city, giving them silver and pieces, and three men with them, who should conduct them as far as Galilee.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.xv-p5"></A>Then the Jews took counsel among themselves when those men had gone up into Galilee; and the rulers of the synagogue shut themselves in, and were cut up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1966"></A><A HREF="#fn_1966"><FONT SIZE="1">1967</FONT></A>
 with great fury, saying:&#160; What sign is this which hath come to pass in Israel?&#160; And Annas and Caiaphas say:&#160; Why are your souls sorrowful?&#160; Are we to believe the soldiers, that an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb?&#160; <i>No;</i> but that his disciples have given much gold to those who were guarding the sepulchre, and have taken Jesus away, and have taught them thus to say:&#160; Say ye that an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb.&#160; Do you not know that it is unlawful for Jews to believe foreigners in a single word, knowing that these same who received sufficient gold from us have said as we taught them?</p>
