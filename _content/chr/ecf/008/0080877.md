Demons.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.xix-p2"></span>“‘These things seem good to the
all-seeing God, that you lord it over no man; that you trouble no one,
unless any one of his own accord subject himself to you, worshipping
you, and sacrificing and pouring libations, and partaking of your table,
or accomplishing aught else that they ought not, or shedding blood, or
tasting dead flesh, or filling themselves with that which is torn of
beasts, or that which is cut, or that which is strangled, or aught else
that is unclean.  But those who betake themselves to my law, you not
only shall not touch, but shall also do honour to, and shall flee from,
their presence.  For whatsoever shall please them, being just,
respecting you, that you shall be constrained to suffer.  But if any of
those who worship me go astray, either committing adultery, or
practising magic, or living impurely, or doing any other of the things
which are not well-pleasing to me, then they will have to suffer
something at your hands or those of others, according to my order.  But
upon them, when they repent, I, judging of their repentance, whether it
be worthy of pardon or not, shall give sentence.  These things,
therefore, ye ought to remember and to do, well knowing that not even
your thoughts shall be able to be concealed from Him.’
