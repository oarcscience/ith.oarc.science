id="vi.iv.ix.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Origin of Chaos.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.iv-p2"></span>“This matter, of four kinds, and
endowed with life, was an entire infinite abyss, so to speak, in eternal
stream, borne about without order, and forming every now and then
countless but ineffectual combinations (which therefore it dissolved
again from want of order); ripe indeed, but not able to be bound so as
to generate a living creature.  And once it chanced that this infinite
sea, which was thus by its own nature driven about with a natural
motion, flowed in an orderly manner from the same to the same (back on
itself), like a whirlpool, mixing the substances in such a way that from
each <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1062](#fn_1061) there flowed down the
middle of the universe (as in the funnel of a mould) precisely that
which was most useful and suitable for the generation of a living
creature.  This was carried down by the all-carrying whirlpool, drew to
itself the surrounding spirit, and having been so conceived that it was
very fertile, formed a separate substance.  For just as a bubble is
usually formed in water, so everything round about contributed to the
conception of this ball-like globe.  Then there came forth to the light,
after it had been conceived in itself, and was borne upwards by the
divine spirit which surrounded it, <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[1063](#fn_1062) perhaps the greatest thing ever
born; a piece of workmanship, so to speak, having life in it which had
been conceived from that entire infinite abyss, in shape like an egg,
and as swift as a bird.
