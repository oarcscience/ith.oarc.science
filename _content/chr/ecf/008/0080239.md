Soul.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.xxix-p2"></span>Then said Simon:  “The one point on
which I should wish to be satisfied is, whether the soul is immortal;
for I cannot take up the burden of righteousness unless I know first
concerning the immortality of the soul; for indeed if it is not
immortal, the profession of your preaching cannot stand.”  Then said
Peter:  “Let us first inquire whether God is just; for if this were
ascertained, the perfect order of religion would straight-way be
established.”  Then Simon:  “With all your boasting of your knowledge of
the order of discussion, you seem to me now to have answered contrary to
order; for when I ask you to show whether the soul is immortal, you say
that we must first inquire whether God is just.”  Then said Peter: 
“That is perfectly right and regular.”  Simon:  “I should wish to learn
how.”
