<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.ix-p2"></A>And when I said that I wished I could meet with some one of those who had seen Him, they immediately brought me to one, saying, &#8220;There is one here who not only is acquainted with Him, but is also of that country, a Hebrew, by name Barnabas, who says that he himself is one of His disciples; and hereabouts he resides, and readily announces to those who will the terms of His promise.&#8221;&#160; Then I went with them; and when I came, I stood listening to his words with the crowd that stood round him; and I perceived that he was speaking the truth not with dialectic art, but was setting forth simply and without preparation what he had heard and seen the manifested Son of God do and say.&#160; And even from the crowd who stood around him he produced many witnesses of the miracles and discourses which he narrated.</p>
