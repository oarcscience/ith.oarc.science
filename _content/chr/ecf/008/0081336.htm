<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvii.iv-p2"></A>And the saints of God heard the wrangling of Satan and Hades.&#160; They, however, though as yet not at all recognising each other, were, notwithstanding, in the possession of their faculties.&#160; But our holy father Adam thus replied to Satan at once:&#160; O captain of death, why dost thou fear and tremble?&#160; Behold, the Lord is coming, who will now destroy all thy inventions; and thou shalt be taken by Him, and bound throughout eternity.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.iv-p3"></A>Then all the saints, hearing the voice of our father Adam, how boldly he replied to Satan in all points, were strengthened in joy; and all running together to father Adam, were crowded in one place.&#160; Then our father Adam, gazing on all that multitude, wondered greatly whether all of them had been begotten from him into the world.&#160; And embracing those who were standing everywhere around him, and shedding most bitter tears, he addressed his son Seth, saying:&#160; Relate, my son Seth, to the holy patriarchs and prophets what the guardian of paradise said to thee, when I sent thee to bring to me of that oil of compassion, in order to anoint my body when I was ill.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.iv-p4"></A>Then he answered:&#160; I, when thou sentest me before the gates of paradise, prayed and entreated the Lord with tears, and called upon the guardian of paradise to give me of it therefrom.&#160; Then Michael the archangel came out, and said to me, Seth, why then dost thou weep?&#160; Know, being informed beforehand, that thy father Adam will not receive of this oil of compassion now, but after many generations of time.&#160; For the most beloved Son of God will come down from heaven into the world, and will be baptized by John in the river Jordan; and then shall thy father Adam receive of this oil&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2007"></A><A HREF="#fn_2007"><FONT SIZE="1">2008</FONT></A>
 of compassion, and all that believe in him.&#160; And of those who have believed in him, their kingdom will endure for ever.</p>
