id="vi.iii.iv.lxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXII.—Peter’s Experience of
Imagination.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lxii-p2"></span>When Simon thus spoke, Peter
answered: <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667)   “Now listen
patiently concerning both these matters, that is, concerning the example
of stretching out the senses, and concerning the immensity of light.  I
know that I myself, O Simon, have sometimes in thought extended my
sense, as you say, into regions and islands situated afar off, and have
seen them with my mind not less than if it had been with my eyes.  When
I was at Capernaum, occupied in the taking of fishes, and sat upon a
rock, holding in my hand a hook attached to a line, and fitted for
deceiving the fishes, *I was so absorbed* that I did not feel a fish
adhering to it while my mind eagerly ran through my beloved Jerusalem,
to which I had frequently gone up, waking, for the sake of offerings and
prayers.  But I was accustomed also to admire this Cæsarea, hearing of
it from others, and to long to see it; and I seemed to myself to see it,
although I had never been in it; and I thought of it what was suitable
to be thought of a great city, its gates, walls, baths, streets, lanes,
markets, and the like, in accordance with what I had seen in other
cities; and to such an extent was I delighted with the intentness of
such inspection, that, as you said, I neither saw one who was present
and standing by me, nor knew where myself was sitting.”  Then said
Simon:  “Now you say well.”

argument against the trustworthiness of supernatural visions, which is
