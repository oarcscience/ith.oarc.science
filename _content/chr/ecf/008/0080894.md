id="vi.iv.xii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Unbelief the Demon’s
Stronghold.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xi-p2"></span>“But it is necessary in our prayers to
acknowledge that we have had recourse to God, and to bear witness, not
to the apathy, but to the slowness of the demon.  For all things are
done to the believer, nothing to the unbeliever.  Therefore the demons
themselves, knowing the amount of faith of those of whom they take
possession, measure their stay proportionately.  Wherefore they stay
permanently with the unbelieving, tarry for a while with the weak in
faith; but with those who thoroughly believe, and who do good, they
cannot remain even for a moment.  For the soul being turned by faith, as
it were, into the nature of water, quenches the demon as a spark of
fire.  The labour, therefore, of every one is to be solicitous about the
putting to flight of his own demon.  For, being mixed up with men’s
souls, they suggest to every one’s mind desires after what things they
please, in order that he may neglect his salvation.
