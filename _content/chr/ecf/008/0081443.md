id="viii.x.i-p1.1"></span>Elucidations.</span>

<span id="viii.x.i-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.x.i-p2.1"></span>I</span>

<span id="viii.x.i-p3"></span>(From Clement to Melchiades, p. 607.)

<span id="viii.x.i-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.x.i-p4.1"></span>The</span> early Bishops of Rome, who till the
time of Sylvester (<span class="c9"><span
id="viii.x.i-p4.2"></span>a.d.</span> 325) were, with few exceptions,
like him pure and faithful shepherds, and not lords over God’s heritage,
shall here be enumerated.  But first let us settle in few words the
historic facts as to the See.

<span id="viii.x.i-p5"></span>St. Paul was, clearly, the Apostolic
founder of the Roman church, as appears from Holy Scripture.  St. Peter
seems to have come to Rome not long before his martyrdom.  Linus and
Cletus could not have been Bishops of Rome, for they were merely
coadjutors of the Apostles *during their lifetime*.  Clement was the
first who succeeded to their work *after their death;* and thus he
should unquestionably be made the first of the Roman bishops,—a position
of which he was eminently worthy, for his was the spirit of St. Peter
himself, <span id="fr_2883"></span>[2884](#fn_2883) as set forth in that
incomparable passage of his first Epistle, <span
id="fr_2884"></span>[2885](#fn_2884) in which the Apostle bids all his
brethren to be shepherds indeed, and “ensamples to the flock.”  We may
therefore give the outline of this history as follows:—

<span id="viii.x.i-p8"></span>1.  St. Paul was the “Apostle of the
Gentiles,” and St. Peter of “the Circumcision.”

<span id="viii.x.i-p9"></span>2.  St. Paul came first to Rome, and
organized the Christians he found there after the pattern “ordained in
all the churches.”

<span id="viii.x.i-p10"></span>3.  He had Linus for his coadjutor, being
himself a prisoner, until he went into Spain.

<span id="viii.x.i-p11"></span>4.  St. Peter came to Rome (*circa* <span
class="c9"><span id="viii.x.i-p11.1"></span>a.d.</span> 64), and
laboured with the Jewish Christians there, St. Paul recognising his
mission among them.

<span id="viii.x.i-p12"></span>5.  This Apostle (soon thrown into
prison) had Cletus for his coadjutor.

<span id="viii.x.i-p13"></span>6.  In the Neronian persecution Linus
seem to have suffered with St. Paul, and probably Cletus as well.  The
latter died before St. Peter.

<span id="viii.x.i-p14"></span>7.  St. Peter, therefore, about to suffer
himself, ordains Clement to succeed him.

<span id="viii.x.i-p15"></span>8.  As he was the first “successor of the
Apostles,” therefore, in the See of Rome, and the first who had
jurisdiction there (for the Apostles certainly never surrendered their
mission to their coadjutors), it follows that Clement was the first
Bishop of Rome.

<span id="viii.x.i-p16"></span>9.  This is confirmed by the earliest
testimony,—that of Ignatius.

<span id="viii.x.i-p17"></span>10.  It agrees with Tertullian’s
testimony, and he speaks (as a lawyer and expert) from “the registers.” 
Irenæus, speaking less precisely, may be harmonized with these
testimonies without violence to what he reports.

<span id="viii.x.i-p48"></span>30.  Sylvester <span class="c9"><span
id="viii.x.i-p48.1"></span>a.d.</span> 314–335.

<span id="viii.x.i-p49"></span>N.B.—After <span class="c9"><span
id="viii.x.i-p49.1"></span>a.d.</span> 325 the Bishops of *Rome* are
canonical primates; the Bishops of *New Rome* primates equally, but
second on the list; then Alexandria, Antioch, Ephesus.  The Councils of
Constantinople and Chalcedon state that these primacies were awarded
because *Rome* and *New Rome* were the capitals of the *œcumene*, or
empire.  The primacy conferred no authority over the sister Sees of
Apostolic foundation, and recognised no inequality among bishops, save
those of such honorary distinction.

<span id="viii.x.i-p50"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.x.i-p50.1"></span>The Patriarchate.</span>

<span id="viii.x.i-p51"></span>1.  From (<span class="c9"><span
id="viii.x.i-p51.1"></span>a.d.</span> 325) Sylvester to Gregory the
Great, and his successor, who lived but one year, the Bishops of Rome
were canonical primates.

<span id="viii.x.i-p52"></span>2.  Boniface III. accepted the court
title of “Universal Bishop” (<span class="c9"><span
id="viii.x.i-p52.1"></span>a.d.</span> 606) from the Emperor Phocas, but
it was not recognised by the Church.

<span id="viii.x.i-p53"></span>3.  From this time to Adrian I. many
Bishops of Rome vied with those of Constantinople to augment their
honour and power.  The establishment of the Western Empire (<span
class="c9"><span id="viii.x.i-p53.1"></span>a.d.</span> 800) made their
ambitious claims acceptable to the Latins; and they became primates of
all Christendom in Western estimation, with extra-canonical and
indefinite claims as “successors of St. Peter.”

<span id="viii.x.i-p54"></span>4.  Nicholas I. (<span class="c9"><span
id="viii.x.i-p54.1"></span>a.d.</span> 863), by means of the False
Decretals, gave shape to these extra-canonical claims, abrogated the
Nicene Constitutions in the West by making these Decretals canon-law,
and asserted a supremacy over the old patriarchares, which they never
allowed:  hence the schism of the West from the Apostolic Sees of the
East, and from the primitive discipline which established the Papacy, as
now understood.

<span id="viii.x.i-p55"></span>5.  From Nicholas I. (who died <span
class="c9"><span id="viii.x.i-p55.1"></span>a.d.</span> 867) the Latin
churches recognised this Papacy more or less; the Gallicans resisting,
though feebly, by asserting their “liberties,” according to Nicene
Constitutions.

<span id="viii.x.i-p56"></span>6.  Gregory VII., honestly persuaded that
the Decretals were authentic, enforced these spurious canons without
reference to antiquity, and pronounced the title of “Pope” the sole and
peculiar dignity of the Bishops of Rome <span class="c9"><span
id="viii.x.i-p56.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1073.  He reigned from <span
class="c9"><span id="viii.x.i-p56.2"></span>a.d.</span> 1061 to 1085.

<span id="viii.x.i-p57"></span>7.  The churches of England and France,
which claimed to be outside of the “holy Roman Empire,” under kings
whose own crowns were “imperial,” maintained a perpetual contest with
the Papacy, admitted the extra-canonical “primacy,” but resisted all
claims to “supremacy.”

<span id="viii.x.i-p58"></span><span id="page_643">p. 643</span> <span
id="viii.x.i-Page_643"></span>8.  School-doctrines were framed and
enforced, but were extra-symbolic, and of no Catholic authority.  They
abused the episcopate to exalt the Papacy.

<span id="viii.x.i-p59"></span>9.  The Council of Trent, after the
Northern revolt from the Papacy and School-doctrine, sat seventeen years
(from <span class="c9"><span id="viii.x.i-p59.1"></span>a.d.</span> 1545
to <span class="c9"><span id="viii.x.i-p59.2"></span>a.d.</span> 1563)
framing the “Roman-Catholic Church” out of the remainder of national
churches, depriving them of their nationalities, and making out of them
all, with the missions in America, one *mixed confederation*, to which
it gave a new creed and new organic laws; debasing the entire episcopate
(which it denied to be an order distinct from that of presbyters), and
making the Pope the “Universal Bishop,” with other bishops reduced to
presbyters, acting as his local vicars.

<span id="viii.x.i-p60"></span>10.  The Gallicans feebly withstood these
changes, and strove to maintain the primitive Constitutions by
accommodations with their theory of the “Gallican liberties,” as founded
by St. Louis.

<span id="viii.x.i-p61"></span>11.  Gallicanism was extinguished by Pope
Pius IX., who proclaimed the Pope “infallible,” and thus raised his
“supremacy” into an article of the Roman-Catholic faith.

<span id="viii.x.i-p62"></span>12.  The following is the modern creed of
“Roman Catholics,” which, with the latest additions, embodies a library
of dogmas in the *eleventh* article, and now, since the decree of
*Infallibility* makes the entire *Bullary* (a vast library of decrees
and definitions), equally part of the Creed. <span
id="fr_2885"></span>[2886](#fn_2885)

<span id="viii.x.i-p64"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.x.i-p64.1"></span>The Trentine Creed, or the Creed of Pius IV.,
<span class="c9"><span id="viii.x.i-p64.2"></span>a.d.</span>
1564.</span>

<span id="viii.x.i-p65"></span>1.  I most stedfastly admit and embrace
Apostolical and ecclesiastical traditions, and all other observances and
constitutions of the Church.

<span id="viii.x.i-p66"></span>2.  I also admit the Holy Scripture
according to that sense which our holy mother the Church has held, and
does hold, to which it belongs to judge of the true sense and
interpretations of the Scriptures.  Neither will I ever take and
interpret them otherwise than according to the unanimous consent of the
Fathers.

<span id="viii.x.i-p67"></span>3.  I also profess that there are truly
and properly seven sacraments of the New Law, instituted by Jesus Christ
our Lord, and necessary for the salvation of mankind, though not all for
every one; to wit, Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Extreme
Unction, Order, and Matrimony; and that they confer grace; and that of
these, Baptism, Confirmation, and Order cannot be reiterated without
sacrilege.  I also receive and admit the received and approved
ceremonies of the Catholic Church in the solemn administration of the
aforesaid sacraments.

<span id="viii.x.i-p68"></span>4.  I embrace and receive all and every
one of the things which have been defined and declared in the holy
Council of Trent concerning original sin and justification.

<span id="viii.x.i-p69"></span>5.  I profess, likewise, that in the Mass
there is offered to God a true, proper, and propitiatory sacrifice for
the living and the dead; and that in the most holy sacrament of the
Eucharist there is truly, really, and substantially, the body and blood,
together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that
there is made a conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the
body, and of the whole substance of the wine into the blood, which
conversion the Catholic Church calls Transubstantiation.  I also confess
that under either kind alone Christ is received whole and entire, and a
true sacrament.

<span id="viii.x.i-p70"></span>6.  I constantly hold that there is a
Purgatory, and that the souls therein detained are helped by the
suffrages of the faithful.

<span id="viii.x.i-p71"></span>7.  Likewise, that the saints, reigning
together with Christ, are to be honoured and invocated, and that they
offer prayers to God for us, and that their relics are to be respected.

<span id="viii.x.i-p72"></span>8.  I most firmly assert that the images
of Christ, of the mother of God, ever virgin, and also of the saints,
ought to be had and retained, and that due honour and veneration is to
be given them.

<span id="viii.x.i-p73"></span>9.  I also affirm that the power of
indulgences was left by Christ in the Church, and that the use of them
is most wholesome to Christian people.

<span id="viii.x.i-p74"></span>10.  I acknowledge the Holy Catholic
Apostolic Roman Church for the mother and mistress of all churches; and
I promise true obedience to the Bishop of Rome, successor to St. Peter,
Prince of the Apostles, and Vicar of Jesus Christ.

<span id="viii.x.i-p75"></span>11.  I likewise undoubtedly receive and
profess all other things delivered, defined, and declared by the sacred
Canons, and general Councils, and particularly by the holy Council of
Trent.

<span id="viii.x.i-p76"></span><span id="page_644">p. 644</span> <span
id="viii.x.i-Page_644"></span>12.  And I condemn, reject, and
anathematize all things contrary thereto, and all heresies whatsoever,
condemned, rejected, and anathematized by the Church.

<span id="viii.x.i-p77"></span>This true Catholic faith, without which
no one can be saved, I N.N. do at this present freely confess and
sincerely hold; and I promise most constantly to retain, and confess the
same entire and unviolated, with God’s assistance, to the end of my
life.  *Amen*.

<span id="viii.x.i-p78"></span>N. B.—(1) To this was added, Dec. 8,
1854, the new article of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary,
to be believed as necessary to salvation.

<span id="viii.x.i-p79"></span>N. B.—(2) To which was added (December,
1864) the whole *Syllabus.*

<span id="viii.x.i-p80"></span>N. B.—(3) To which was added (July 18,
1870) the new dogma of Infallibility.

<span id="viii.x.i-p81"></span>Observe, this “Creed” is imposed on all
in the Roman Obedience, and especially on those who enter it from other
communions, as that without which *no one can be saved*.  The Catholic
Creed of Nicæa is not sufficient.  But the Seventh Canon of Ephesus not
only forbids the composition of any other creed, but especially adds: 
“Those *who shall presume to compose another creed*, or to produce or
offer it to persons desiring to return to the acknowledgment of the
truth…from any heresy whatever, shall be deposed…if bishops or *other*
clergy, and if they be laymen they shall be anathematized.”

himself rashly to the following position:  “If a people possess one of
these *Codes of Belief*, we may be sure of this:  that the religion of
such a people is false.”  No people on earth has such as enormous *Code
of Belief* as those who profess the creed of Pius the Fourth, and who
accept the decrees of Pius the Ninth.  See De Maistre, *Le Principe
Générateur*, etc., p. 20, Paris, 1852.  This Trent Creed is the fruit of
the Decretals.
