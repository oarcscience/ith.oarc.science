Proposed.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xx-p2"></span>When Simon heard this, he said:  “Far
be it from me to become his or your disciple.  For I am not ignorant of
what I ought to know; but the inquiries which I made as a learner were
made that I may see if you can prove that actual sight is more distinct
than apparition. <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367)   But you
spoke according to your own pleasure; you did not prove.  And now,
to-morrow I shall come to your opinions in regard to God, whom you
affirmed to be the framer of the world; and in my discussion with you, I
shall show that he is not the highest, nor good, and that your teacher
made the same statements as I now do; and I shall prove that you have
not understood him.”  On saying this he went away, not wishing to listen
to what might be said to the propositions which he had laid down.

<span id="vi.iv.xx.xx-p3"></span> This passage is corrupt in the text. 
Dressel reads, “that activity is more distinct than apparition.”  By
activity would be meant, “acting while one is awake, and in full
possession of his sense;” and thus the meaning would be nearly the same
as in our translation.
