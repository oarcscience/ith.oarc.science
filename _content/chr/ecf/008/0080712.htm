<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p2"></A>&#8220;Hence the ambiguous name which she gave to her first-born son, calling him <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p2.1"></A>Cain</span>, which has a capability of interpretation in two ways;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_969"></A><A HREF="#fn_969"><FONT SIZE="1">970</FONT></A>
 for it is interpreted both <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p3.1"></A>Possession</span> and <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p3.2"></A>Envy</span>, as signifying that in the future he was to envy either a woman, or possessions, or the love of the parents towards her.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_970"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">971</FONT></A>
&#160; But if it be none of these, then it will befall him to be called the <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxv-p4.1"></A>Possession</span>.&#160; For she possessed him first, which also was advantageous to him.&#160; For he was a murderer and a liar, and with his sins was not willing to be at peace with respect to the government.&#160; Moreover, those who came forth by succession from him were the first adulterers.&#160; And there were psalteries, and harps, and forgers of instruments of war.&#160; Wherefore also the prophecy of his descendants being full of adulterers and of psalteries, secretly by means of pleasures excites to wars.</p>
