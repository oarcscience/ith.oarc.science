<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p2"></A>And Pilate seeing, fear seized him, and immediately he wished to rise from the tribunal.&#160; And while he was thinking of this, <i>viz</i>., to rise and go away, his wife sent to him, saying:&#160; Have nothing to do with that just man,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1956"></A><A HREF="#fn_1956"><FONT SIZE="1">1957</FONT></A>
 for I have suffered much on account of him this night.&#160; And Pilate, calling the Jews, said to them:&#160; Ye know that my wife is a worshipper of God, and in Judaism thinks rather with you.&#160; The Jews say to him:&#160; So it is, and we know.&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; Lo, my wife has sent to me, saying:&#160; Have nothing to do with that just man,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1957"></A><A HREF="#fn_1957"><FONT SIZE="1">1958</FONT></A>
 for I have suffered much on account of him this night.&#160; And the Jews answering, said to Pilate:&#160; Did we not say to thee that he is a magician?&#160; Lo, he has sent a vision of dreams to thy wife.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p5"></A>Pilate called Jesus, and said to him:&#160; What is it that these witness against thee, and sayest thou nothing to them?&#160; And Jesus answered:&#160; If they had not the power, they would not speak.&#160; Every one has power over his own mouth to say good and evil; let them see&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1958"></A><A HREF="#fn_1958"><FONT SIZE="1">1959</FONT></A>
 <i>to it</i>.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p7"></A>And the elders of the Jews answering, say to Jesus:&#160; What shall we see?&#160; First, that thou wast born of fornication; second, that at thy birth in Bethlehem there took place a massacre of infants; third, that thy father Joseph and thy mother Mary fled into Egypt, because they had no confidence in the people.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p8"></A>Some of the bystanders, kind <i>men</i> of the Jews, say:&#160; We say that he was not born of fornication; but we know that Mary was espoused to Joseph, and that he was not born of fornication.&#160; Pilate says to the Jews who said that he was of fornication:&#160; This speech of yours is not true, seeing that the betrothal took place, as these of your nation say.&#160; Annas and Caiaphas say to Pilate:&#160; We with all the multitude say that he was born of fornication, and that he is a magician; but these are proselytes, and his disciples.&#160; And Pilate, calling Annas and Caiaphas, says to them:&#160; What are proselytes?&#160; They say to him:&#160; They have been born sons of the Gen<A NAME="page_441"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 441</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xv.iii-Page_441"></A>tiles, and then have become Jews.&#160; Then answered those who testified that Jesus was not born of fornication, Lazarus and Asterius, Antonius and James, Annes and Azaras, Samuel and Isaac, Finees and Crispus, Agrippa and Judas:&#160; We were not born proselytes, but are sons of the Jews, and we speak the truth; for we were present at the betrothal of Mary.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p9"></A>And Pilate, calling to him those twelve men who proved that Jesus had not been born of fornication, said to them:&#160; I adjure you by the health of C&aelig;sar, tell me if it be true that Jesus was not born of fornication.&#160; They say to Pilate:&#160; We have a law not to swear, because it is a sin; but let them swear by the health of C&aelig;sar that it is not as we say, and we are worthy of death.&#160; Then said Pilate to Annas and Caiaphas:&#160; Answer you nothing to those things which these testify?&#160; Annas and Caiaphas say to Pilate:&#160; Those twelve are believed that he is not born of fornication; we&#8212;all the people&#8212;cry out that he was born of fornication, and is a magician, and says that he himself is the Son of God and a king, and we are not believed.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.iii-p10"></A>And Pilate ordered all the multitude to go outside, except the twelve men who said that He was not born of fornication, and ordered to separate Jesus from them.&#160; And Pilate says to them:&#160; For what reason do the Jews wish to put Jesus to death?&#160; And they say to him:&#160; They are angry because he heals on the Sabbath.&#160; Pilate said:&#160; For a good work do they wish to put him to death?&#160; They say to him:&#160; Yes, my lord.</p>
