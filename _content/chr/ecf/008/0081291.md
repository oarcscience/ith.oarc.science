id="vii.xiv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3 (19).</span>

<span id="vii.xiv.iii-p2"></span>While John, therefore, was thus
teaching those in Hades, the first created and forefather Adam heard,
and said to his son Seth:  My son, I wish thee to tell the forefathers
of the race of men and the prophets where I sent thee, when it fell to
my lot to die.  And Seth said:  Prophets and patriarchs, hear.  When my
father Adam, the first created, was about to fall once upon a time into
death, he sent me to make entreaty to God very close by the gate of
paradise, that He would guide me by an angel to the tree of compassion
and that I might take oil and anoint my father, and that he might rise
up from his sickness:  which thing, therefore, I also did.  And after
the prayer an angel of the Lord came, and said to me:  What, Seth, dost
thou ask?  Dost thou ask oil which raiseth up the sick, or the tree from
which this oil flows, on account of the sickness of thy father?  This is
not to be found now.  Go, therefore, and tell thy father, that after the
accomplishing of five thousand five hundred years <span
id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938) from the creation of the world,
then shalt come into the earth the only begotten Son of God, being made
man; and He shall anoint him with this oil, and shall raise him up; and
shall wash clean, with water and with the Holy Spirit, both him and
those out of him, and then shall he be healed of every disease; but now
this is impossible. <span id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939)

<span id="vii.xiv.iii-p5"></span>When the patriarchs and the prophets
heard these words, they rejoiced greatly.
