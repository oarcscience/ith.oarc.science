<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.xii-p2"></A>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole earth; and the sun was obscured, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.&#160; And crying out with a loud voice, He said:&#160; Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.&#160; And thus saying, He gave up the ghost.&#160; And the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying:&#160; This was a just man.&#160; And all the people who were present at that spectacle, seeing what was done, beating their breasts, returned.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.xii-p3"></A>And the centurion reported to the governor what was done.&#160; And the governor and his wife hearing, were very sorrowful, and neither ate nor drank that day.&#160; And Pilate, calling together the Jews, said to them:&#160; Have you seen what has been done?&#160; And they said to the governor:&#160; There has been an eclipse of the sun, as is usual.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.xii-p4"></A>And his acquaintances also stood afar off, and the women who had followed Him from Galilee, seeing these things.&#160; And lo, a certain man, by name Joseph, holding office, a man good and just, who did not consent to their counsels nor their deeds, from Arimath&aelig;a,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1962"></A><A HREF="#fn_1962"><FONT SIZE="1">1963</FONT></A>
 a city of the Jews, waiting, he also, for the kingdom of God, went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.&#160; And taking Him down from the cross, he wrapped Him in clean linen, and laid Him in his own new tomb, in which no one had been laid.</p>
