<span id="vi.iv.xxii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Theories in Regard to the
Origin of the Devil.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.ix-p2"></span>“But, as you said, if the evil one is
created either he has been begotten as an animal, or he has been sent
forth substantially by Him, <span id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423)
or he has been compounded externally, or his will has arisen through
composition; or it happened that he came into existence from things
non-existent, without composition and the will of God; or he has been
made by God from that which in no manner and nowhere exists; or the
matter, being lifeless or living, from which he has arisen was outside
of God; or he fashioned himself, or he was made by God, or he is a
relative thing, or he ever existed:  for we cannot say that he does not
exist, since we have agreed in thinking that he does exist.”  And Simon
said:  “Well have you distinguished all the methods of accounting for
his existence in a summary manner.  Now it is my part to examine these
various ideas, and to show that the Creator is blameable.  But it is
your business to prove, as you promised, that he is free from all
blame.  But I wonder if you will be able.  For, first, if the devil has
been begotten from God as an animal, the vice which is his is
accordingly the same as that of him who sends him forth.”  And Peter
said:  “Not at all.  For we see many men who are good the fathers of
wicked children, and others who are wicked the fathers of good children,
and others again who are wicked producing both good *and wicked* <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424) children, and others who are good
having both wicked and good children.  For instance, the first man who
was created produced the unrighteous Cain and the righteous Abel.”  To
this Simon said:  “You are acting foolishly, in using human examples
when discoursing about God.”  And Peter said:  “Speak you, then, to us
about God without using human examples, and yet so that what you say can
be understood; but you are not able to do so.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1423"></span>[333:1424](0081128.htm#fr_1423) <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.ix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.ix-p3"></span> The text here is evidently corrupt
in many places.  If the reading “by him” is to be retained, we must
suppose, with Wieseler, that “by God” is omitted in the previous
clause.  Probably it should be, “by himself.”

<span id="fn_1424"></span>[333:1425](0081128.htm#fr_1424) <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.ix-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.ix-p4"></span> “And bad” is not in the <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.ix-p4.1"></span>mss.</span>, but is
required by the context.
