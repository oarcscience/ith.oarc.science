<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.xv-p2"></A>And Simon, being vexed at this, said:&#160; &#8220;Blame your own teacher, who said, &#145;I thank Thee, Lord of heaven and earth, that what was concealed from the wise, Thou hast revealed to suckling babes.&#146;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1385"></A><A HREF="#fn_1385"><FONT SIZE="1">1386</FONT></A>
&#160; And Peter said: &#160;&#8220;This is not the way in which the statement was made; but I shall speak of it as if it had been made in the way that has seemed good to you.&#160; Our Lord, even if He had made this statement, &#145;What was concealed from the wise, the Father revealed to babes,&#146; could not even thus be thought to point out another God and Father in addition to Him who created the world.&#160; For it is possible that the concealed things of which He spoke may be those of the Creator (Demiurge) himself; because Isaiah&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1386"></A><A HREF="#fn_1386"><FONT SIZE="1">1387</FONT></A>
 says, &#145;I will open my mouth in parables, and I will belch forth things concealed from the foundation of the world.&#146;&#160; Do you allow, then, that the prophet was not ignorant of the things concealed, which Jesus says were concealed from the wise, but revealed to babes?&#160; And how was the Creator (Demiurge) ignorant of them, if his prophet Isaiah was not ignorant of them?&#160; But our Jesus did not in reality say &#145;what was concealed,&#146; but He said what seems a harsher statement; for He said, &#145;<i>Thou hast concealed these things from the wise</i>, and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1387"></A><A HREF="#fn_1387"><FONT SIZE="1">1388</FONT></A>
 hast revealed them to sucking babes.&#146;&#160; Now the word &#145;Thou hast concealed&#146; implies that they had once been known to them; for the key of the kingdom of heaven, that is, the knowledge of the secrets, lay with them.</p>
