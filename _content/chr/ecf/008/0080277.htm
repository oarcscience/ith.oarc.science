&#160; Therefore, as all those who were anxious followed Peter from each city, we were a great multitude of elect ones when we entered into Tripolis.&#160; On our arrival, the brethren who had been sent before met us before the gates of the city; and taking us under their charge, conducted us to the various lodgings which they had prepared.&#160; Then there arose a commotion <A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.vi.i-Page_135"></A>in the city, and a great assemblage of persons desirous to see Peter.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_718"></A><A HREF="#fn_718"><FONT SIZE="1">719</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vi.iii.vi.i-p4"></A> [In books iv.&#8211;vi. the scene is laid at Tripolis.&#160; The same city is the locality to which Homilies VIII.&#8211;XI. are assigned.&#160; The intervening portion (Homilies IV.&#8211;VII.) gives the details of the journey here alluded to, telling of various discourses at Tyre.&#160; Some of the matter of these discourses occurs in the <i>Recognitions</i>, but under different circumstances.&#160; The heathen disputants are not the same.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.iii.vi.i-p5"></A>The parallelisms of the portions assigned to Tripolis are as follows:&#160; book iv. has its counterpart in Homily VIII. and in much of Homily IX.; book v. has a parallel in Homily X. and it, parts of XI.; book vi. in its general outline resembles Homily XI.</p> 
<p><a name="vi.iii.vi.i-p6"></A>The discourses of the Apostle as given in the <i>Recognitions</i> are more orderly and logical than those in the <i>Homilies</i>.&#160; The views presented differ somewhat, in accordance with the general character of the two works.&#160; Much of the matter in the <i>Recognitions</i> occurs in a different order in the <i>Homilies</i>, but the internal evidence seems to point to the priority of the former.&#160; Both might be different manipulations of a common documentary source, but that theory is not necessarily applicable to these portions of the literature.&#8212;R.]</p>
