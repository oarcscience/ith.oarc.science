<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.xxi-p2"></A>While Peter thus spoke, the woman, who had listened attentively, swooned away as if in stupor.&#160; But Peter approached her, and caught hold of her, and exhorted her to restrain herself, persuading her to confess what was the matter with her.&#160; But she, being powerless in the rest of her body, as through intoxication, turned her <i>head</i> round, being able to sustain the greatness of the hoped for joy, and rubbing her face:&#160; &#8220;Where,&#8221; said she, &#8220;is this youth?&#8221;&#160; And he, now seeing through the whole affair, said, &#8220;Tell me first; for otherwise you cannot see him.&#8221;&#160; Then she earnestly said, &#8220;I am that youth&#146;s mother.&#8221;&#160; Then said Peter, &#8220;What is his name?&#8221;&#160; And she said, &#8220;Clement.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said, &#8220;It is the same, and he it was that spoke to me a little while ago, whom I ordered to wait for me in the boat.&#160; And she, falling at Peter&#146;s feet, entreated him to make haste to come to the boat.&#160; Then Peter, &#8220;If you will keep terms with me, I shall do so.&#8221;&#160; Then she said, &#8220;I will do anything; only show me my only child.&#160; For I shall seem to see in him my two children who died here.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said, &#8220;When ye see him, be quiet, until we depart from the island.&#8221;&#160; And she said, &#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>
