Faith.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxviii-p2"></span>“These sayings of Gamaliel did
not much please Caiaphas; and holding him in suspicion, as it seemed, he
began to insinuate himself cunningly into the discussions:  for, smiling
at what Gamaliel had said, the chief of the priests asked of James, the
chief of the bishops, <span id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593) that the
discourse concerning Christ should not be drawn but from the Scriptures;
‘that we may know,’ said he, ‘whether Jesus be the very Christ or no.’ 
Then said James, ‘We must first inquire from what Scriptures we are
especially to derive our discussion.’  Then he, with difficulty, at
length overcome by reason, answered, that it must be derived from the
law; and afterwards he made mention also of the prophets.”
