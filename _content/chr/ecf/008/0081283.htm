<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xiii.xiii-p2"></A>When the Jews were made acquainted with these things done by Joseph and Nicodemus, they were greatly stirred up against them.&#160; And the chief priests Annas and Caiaphas sent for Joseph, and said:&#160; Why hast thou done this service to Jesus?&#160; Joseph says:&#160; I know that Jesus was a man just, and true, and good in all respects; and I know also that you, through hatred, managed to murder him:&#160; and therefore I buried him.&#160; Then the high priests were enraged, and laid hold of Joseph, and threw him into prison, and said to him:&#160; If we had not to-morrow the feast of unleavened bread, tomorrow also should we have put thee, like him, to death; but being kept in the meantime, early in the morning of the Lord&#146;s day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1918"></A><A HREF="#fn_1918"><FONT SIZE="1">1919</FONT></A>
 thou shalt be given up to death.&#160; Thus they spoke, and affixed their seal to the prison, having secured it by fastenings of all sorts.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.xiii-p4"></A>Thus, therefore, when the Preparation was ended, early on the Sabbath the Jews went away to Pilate, and said to him:&#160; My lord, that deceiver said, that after three days he should rise again.&#160; Lest, therefore, his disciples should steal him by night, and lead the people astray by such deceit, order his tomb to be guarded.&#160; Pilate therefore, upon this, gave them five hundred soldiers, who also sat round the sepulchre so as to guard it, after having put seals upon the stone of the tomb.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1919"></A><A HREF="#fn_1919"><FONT SIZE="1">1920</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.xiii-p6"></A>The Lord&#146;s day, then, having dawned, the chief priests, along with the Jews, called a council, and sent to take Joseph out of the prison, in order to put him to death.&#160; But having opened it, they found him not.&#160; And they were astonished at this&#8212;how, with the doors shut, and the bolts safe, and the seals unbroken, Joseph had disappeared.</p>
