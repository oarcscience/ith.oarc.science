<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xxi-p2"></A>When he had thus spoken, I answered:&#160; &#8220;Now do I thank God; for as I wished to be convinced, so He has vouchsafed to me.&#160; However, so far as concerns me, be you so far without anxiety that I shall never doubt; so much so, that if you yourself should ever wish to remove me from the prophetic doctrine, you should not be able, so well do I know what I have received.&#160; And do not think that it is a great thing that I promise you that I shall never doubt; for neither I myself, nor any man who has heard your discourse concerning the Prophet, can ever doubt of the true doctrine, having first heard and understood what is the truth of the prophetic announcement.&#160; Wherefore have confidence in the God-willed dogma; for every art of wickedness has been conquered.&#160; For against prophecy, neither arts of discourses, nor tricks of sophisms, nor syllogisms, nor any other contrivance, can prevail anything; that is, if he who has heard the true Prophet really is desirous of truth, and does not give heed to aught else under pretext of truth.&#160; So that, my lord Peter, be not disconcerted, as though you had presented the greatest good to a senseless person; for you have presented it to one sensible of the favour, and who cannot be seduced from the truth that has been committed to him.&#160; For I know that it is one of those things which one wishes to receive quickly, and not to attain slowly.&#160; Therefore I know that I should not despise, on account of the quickness <i>with which I have got it</i>, what has been committed to me, what is incomparable, and what alone is safe.&#8221;</p>
