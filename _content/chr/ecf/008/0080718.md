id="vi.iv.vi.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.—Faith in God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxi-p2"></span>“And we tell you truly, it shall be
more tolerable in the day of judgment to dwell in the land of Sodom and
Gomorrah, than in the place of unbelief.  In the first place, because
you have not preserved of yourselves what is reasonable; in the second
place, because, hearing the things concerning us, you have not come to
us; and in the third place, because you have disbelieved us when we have
come to you.  Wherefore, being concerned for you, we pray of our own
accord that our peace may come upon you.  If therefore ye will have it,
you must readily promise not to do injustice, and generously to bear
wrong; which the nature of man would not sustain, unless it first
received the knowledge of that which is supremely profitable, which is
to know the righteous nature of Him who is over all, that He defends and
avenges those who are wronged, and does good for ever to the pious.
