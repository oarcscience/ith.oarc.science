Stars.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xxii-p2"></span>“But lest the assertion may seem
doubtful respecting things which are not manifest to all, let us come to
those things of which nobody is ignorant.  Who disposed the courses of
the stars with so great reason, ordained their risings and settings, and
appointed to each one to accomplish the circuit of the heavens in
certain and regular times?  Who assigned to some to be always
approaching to the setting, and others to be returning to the rising? 
Who put a measure upon the courses of the sun, that he might mark out,
by his diverse motions, hours, and days, and months, and changes of
seasons?—that he might distinguish, by the sure measurement of his
course, now winter, then spring, summer, and afterwards autumn, and
always, by the same changes of the year, complete the circle with
variety, without confusion?  Who, I say, will not pronounce that the
director of such order is the very wisdom of God?  And these things we
have spoken according to the relations given us by the Greeks respecting
the science of the heavenly bodies.
