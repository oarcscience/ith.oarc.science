<span id="vi.iii.xii.xix-p2"></span>“But when he understood from the
lessening of her belly that her child was born, he demanded it, that he
might devour it; then Rhea presented him with a large stone, and told
him that that was what she had brought forth.  And he took it, and
swallowed it; and the stone, when it was devoured, pushed and drove
forth those sons whom he had formerly swallowed.  Therefore Orcus,
coming forth first, descended, and occupies the lower, that is, the
infernal regions.  The second, being above him—he whom they call
Neptune—is thrust forth upon the waters.  The third, who survived by the
artifice of his mother Rhea, she put upon a she-goat and sent into
heaven.
