Prophets.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxxv-p2"></span>Then after three months were
fulfilled, he ordered me to fast for several days, and then brought me
to the fountains that are near to the sea, and baptized me as in
ever-flowing water.  Thus, therefore, when our brethren rejoiced at my
God-gifted regeneration, not many days after he turned to the elders in
presence of all the church, and charged them, saying:  “Our Lord and
Prophet, who hath sent us, declared to us that the wicked one, having
disputed with Him forty days, and having prevailed nothing against Him,
promised that he would send apostles from amongst his subjects, to
deceive.  Wherefore, above all, remember to shun apostle or teacher or
prophet who does not first accurately compare his preaching with *that
of* James, who was called the brother of my Lord, and to whom was
entrusted to administer the church of the Hebrews in Jerusalem,—and that
even though he come to you with witnesses: <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138)   lest the wickedness which
disputed forty days with the Lord, and prevailed nothing, should
afterwards, like lightning falling from heaven upon the earth, <span
id="page_292">p. 292</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xiv.xxxv-Page_292"></span>send a preacher to your injury, as
now he has sent Simon upon us, preaching, under pretence of the truth,
in the name of the Lord, and sowing error.  Wherefore He who hath sent
us, said, ‘Many shall come to me in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they
are ravening wolves.  By their fruits ye shall know them.’”
