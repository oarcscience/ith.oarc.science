id="vi.iv.x.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Peter Goes to Byblus and
Tripolis.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.x.xii-p2"></span>As he said these things, all fell on
their knees before his feet.  And he, lifting up his hands to heaven,
prayed to God, and healed them all by his simple prayer alone.  And he
remained not many days in Beyrout; but after he had accustomed many to
the service of the one God, and had baptized them, and had set over them
a bishop from the elders who were with him, he went to Byblus.  And when
he came there, and learned that Simon had not waited for them for a day,
but had gone straightway to Tripolis, he remained there only a few days;
and after that he had healed not a few, and exercised them in the
Scriptures, he followed in Simon’s track to Tripolis, preferring to
pursue him rather than flee from him.
