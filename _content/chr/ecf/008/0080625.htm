<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iv.xv-p2"></A>But having spent <i>some</i> days, and not having been able to recover the whole debt, for the sake of speed I neglected the balance, as being a hindrance, and myself also set sail for Jud&aelig;a, and in fifteen days arrived at C&aelig;sarea Stratonis.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_910"></A><A HREF="#fn_910"><FONT SIZE="1">911</FONT></A>
&#160; And when I had landed, and was seeking for a lodging, I learned that one named Peter, who was the most esteemed disciple of the Man who had appeared in Jud&aelig;a, and had done signs and wonders, was going to have a verbal controversy next day with Simon, a Samaritan of Gitthi.&#160; When I heard this, I begged to be shown his lodging; and as soon as I learned it, I stood before the door.&#160; And those who were in the house, seeing me, discussed the question who I was, and whence I had come.&#160; And, behold, Barnabas came out; and as soon as he saw me he embraced me, rejoicing greatly, and weeping.&#160; And he took me by the hand, and conducted me to where Peter was, saying to me, &#8220;This is Peter, of whom I told you as being the greatest in the wisdom of God, and I have spoken to him of you continually.&#160; Therefore enter freely,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_911"></A><A HREF="#fn_911"><FONT SIZE="1">912</FONT></A>
 for I have told him your excellent qualities, without falsehood; and, at the same time, have disclosed to him your intention, so that he himself also is desirous to see you.&#160; Therefore I offer him a great gift when by my hands I present you to him.&#8221;&#160; Thus saying, he presented me, and said, &#8220;This, O Peter, is Clement.&#8221;</p>
