 and according to the injunction of Peter, who sent us, we lodged with Bernice, the daughter of Justa the Canaanitess.&#160; She received us most joyfully; and striving with much honour towards me, and with affection towards Aquila and Nicetas, and speaking freely as a friend, through joy she treated us courteously, and hospitably urged us to take bodily refreshment.&#160; Perceiving, therefore, that she was endeavouring to impose a short delay upon us, I said:&#160; &#8220;You do well, indeed, to busy yourself in fulfilling the part of love; but the fear of our God must take the precedence of this.&#160; For, having a combat on hand on behalf of many souls, we are afraid of preferring our own ease before their salvation.</p>
