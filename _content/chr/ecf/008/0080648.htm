<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xv-p2"></A>&#8220;Hence therefore God, teaching men with respect to the truth of existing things, being Himself one, has distinguished all principles into pairs and opposites,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_922"></A><A HREF="#fn_922"><FONT SIZE="1">923</FONT></A>
 Himself being one and sole God from the beginning, having made heaven and earth, day and night, light and fire, sun and moon, life and death.&#160; But man alone amongst these He made self-controlling, having a fitness to be either righteous or unrighteous.&#160; To him also he hath varied the figures of combinations, placing before him small things first, and great ones afterwards, such as the world and eternity.&#160; But the world that now is, is temporary; that which shall be, is eternal.&#160; First is ignorance, then knowledge.&#160; So also has He arranged the leaders of prophecy.&#160; For, since the present world is female, as a mother bringing forth the souls of her children, but the world to come is male, as a father receiving his children <i>from their mother</i>, therefore in this world there come a succession of prophets, as being sons of the world to come, and having knowledge of men.&#160; And if pious men had understood this mystery, they would never have gone astray, but even now they should have known that Simon, who now enthralls all men, is a fellow-worker of error and deceit.&#160; Now, the doctrine of the prophetic rule is as follows.</p>
