id="vi.iii.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Idols Unprofitable.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xiv-p2"></span>“Begin, <span
id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760) therefore, to cast out of your minds
the vain ideas of idols, and your useless and empty fears, that at the
same time you may also escape the condition of unrighteous bondage.  For
those have become your lords, who could not even have been profitable
servants to you.  For how should lifeless images seem fit even to serve
you, when they can neither hear, nor see, nor feel anything?  Yea, even
the material of which they are made, whether it be gold or silver, or
even brass or wood, though it might have profited you for necessary
uses, you have rendered wholly inefficient and useless by fashioning
gods out of it.  We therefore declare to you the true worship of God,
and at the same time warn and exhort the worshippers, that by good deeds
they imitate Him whom they worship, and hasten to return to His image
and likeness, as we said before.
