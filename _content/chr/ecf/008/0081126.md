id="vi.iv.xxii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Peter Suspects Simon of Not
Believing Even in a God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.vii-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “You are not so
blessed as to praise Him, nor indeed can you do such a good deed as
this; for then you would be full of Him.  For thus said our Teacher, who
always spoke the truth:  ‘Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaketh.’ <span id="fr_1420"></span>[1421](#fn_1420)   Whence you,
abounding in evil purposes, through ignorance speak against the only
good God.  And not yet suffering what you deserve to suffer for the
words which you have dared to utter, <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1422](#fn_1421) you either imagine that there will
be no judgment, or perchance you think that there is not even a God. 
Whence, not comprehending such long-suffering as His, you are moving on
to still greater madness.”  And Simon said:  “Do not imagine that you
will frighten me into not investigating the truth of your examples.  For
I am so eager for the truth, that for its sake I will not shrink from
undergoing danger.  If, then, you have anything to say in regard to the
propositions made by me at the commencement, say it now.”
