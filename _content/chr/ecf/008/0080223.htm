<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xiii-p2"></A>Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;I shall speak, not as under compulsion from you, but at the request of the hearers.&#160; The power of choice is the sense of the soul, possessing a quality by which it can be inclined towards what acts it wills.&#8221;&#160; Then Simon, applauding Peter for what he had spoken, said:&#160; &#8220;Truly you have expounded it magnificently and incomparably, for it is my duty to bear testimony to your speaking well.&#160; Now if you will explain to me this which I now ask you, in all things else I shall submit to you.&#160; What I wish to learn, then, is this:&#160; if what God wishes to be, is; and what He does not wish to be, is not.&#160; Answer me this.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter:&#160; &#8220;If you do not know that you are asking an absurd and incompetent question, I shall pardon you and explain; but if you are aware that you are asking inconsequently, you do not well.&#8221;&#160; Then Simon said:&#160; &#8220;I swear by the Supreme Divinity, whatsoever that may be, which judges and punishes those who sin, that I know not what I have said inconsequently, or what absurdity there is in my words, that is, in those that I have just uttered.&#8221;</p>
