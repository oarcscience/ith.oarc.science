id="vi.iv.x.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—The Way of Salvation.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.x.xi-p2"></span>“Were I able to cause earthquakes, and
do all that I wish, I assure you I would not destroy Simon and his
friends (for not to destroy men am I sent), but would make him my
friend, that he might no longer, by his slanders against my preaching
the truth, hinder the salvation of many.  But if you believe me, he
himself is a magician; he is a slanderer; he is a minister of evil to
them who know not the truth.  Therefore he has power to bring diseases
on sinners, having the sinners themselves to help him in his power over
them.  But I am a servant of God the Creator of all things, and a
disciple of His Prophet who is at His right hand.  Wherefore I, being
His apostle, preach the truth:  to serve a good man I drive away
diseases, for I am His second messenger, since first the disease comes,
but after that the healing.  By that evil-working magician, then, you
were stricken with disease because you revolted from God.  By me, if you
believe on Him ye shall be cured:  and so having had experience that He
is able, you may turn to good works, and have your souls saved.”
