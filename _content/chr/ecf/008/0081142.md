id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The Inequalities of Lot
in Human Life.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.xxiii-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “Let me grant
that this is the case:  does not the inequality of lot amongst men seem
to you most unjust?  For one is in penury, another is rich; one is sick,
another is in good health:  and there are innumerable differences of a
like character in human life.” <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470)   And Peter said:  “Do you not
perceive, Simon, that you are again shooting your observations beyond
the mark?  For while we were discussing evil, you have made a
digression, and introduced the question of the anomalies that appear in
this world.  But I shall speak even to this point.  The world is an
instrument artistically contrived, that for the male who is to exist
eternally, the female may bear eternal righteous sons.  Now they could
not have been rendered perfectly pious here, had there been no needy
ones for them to help.  In like manner there are the sick, that they may
have objects for their care.  And the other afflictions admit of a like
explanation.”  And Simon said:  “Are not those in humble circumstances
unfortunate? for they are subjected to distress, that others may be made
righteous.”  And Peter said:  “If their humiliation were eternal, their
misfortune would be very great.  But the humiliations and exaltations of
men take place according to lot; and he who is not pleased with his lot
can appeal, <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471) and by trying his
case according to law, he can exchange his mode of life for another.” 
And Simon said:  “What do you mean by this lot and this appeal?”  And
Peter said:  “You are now demanding the exposition of another topic; but
if you permit me, we can show you how, being born again, and changing
your origin, and living according to law, you will obtain eternal
salvation.”
