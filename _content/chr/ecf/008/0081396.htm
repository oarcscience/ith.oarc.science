<p class="c21"><a name="viii.iii.iii-p2"></A>1.&#160; The translator&#146;s reference to Canon 73 is a mistake, and quite misleading.&#160; See vol. vii. Canon 74, p. 504.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="viii.iii.iii-p3"></A>2.&#160; It is worth while to recall who and what Zephyrinus was.&#160; See vol. v. p. 156, Elucidation V.; also same volume of this series, p. 157, Elucidation VI.&#160; This unhappy prelate was a heretic; and his decrees and opinions are worthless, as Hippolytus shows.&#160; Hence this letter, even were it genuine, would be of no value whatever.&#160; Consult also vol. v. p. 156, in Elucidation IV.; also same volume, Elucidation III.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="viii.iii.iii-p4"></A>3.&#160; On p. 610, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#000">Ep. 2</a><a name="viii.iii.iii-p4.1"></A>, sec. 1, observe the reference to the &#8220;statutes of Emperors,&#8221; where the wily forger forgot himself, as if the C&aelig;sars of this date had legislated for the Christian Church.&#160; On the spirit of the ancient Canons, refuting all these Decretals, compare the Canons of Nic&aelig;a, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 15; of Constantinople, 2 and 3; of Ephesus, 8; and of Chalcedon, 9 and 28.&#160; To these Canons, against the claims of the Paparchy, the Church of England appealed at her Restoration.</p>
