<span id="viii.iv.i.ii-p2"></span>(Of the seasons for fasting.)

<span id="viii.iv.i.ii-p3"></span>Fasting, which ye have learned to hold
three times in the year among us, we decree now to take place, as more
suitable, in four seasons; so that even as the year revolves through
four seasons, we too may keep a solemn fast quarterly in the four
seasons of the year.  And as we are replenished with corn, and wine, and
oil for the nourishment of our bodies, so let us be replenished with
fasting for the nourishment of our souls, in accordance with the word of
the prophet Zechariah, who says, “The word of the Lord came to me,
saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, As I thought to punish you, when
your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I repented not; so again have I
thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem, and to the house of
Judah:  fear ye not.  These are the things that ye shall do:  Speak ye
every man the truth to his neighbour; judge the truth and the judgment
of peace in your gates; and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts
against his neighbour, and love no false oath:  for all these are things
that I hate, saith the Lord of hosts.  And the word of the Lord of hosts
came unto me, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The fast of the
fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh,
and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of the Lord joy and
gladness, and cheerful feasts; only love the truth and peace, saith the
Lord of hosts.” <span id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724)   In this,
then, we ought to be all of one mind, so that, according to apostolic
teaching, we may all say the same thing, and that there be no divisions
among us.  Let us then be perfect in the same mind, and in the same
judgment; <span id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725) in ready zeal for
which work we congratulate ourselves on having your affection as our
partner.  For it is not meet for the members to be at variance with the
head; but, according to the testimony of sacred Scripture, <span
id="fr_2726"></span>[2727](#fn_2726) all the members should follow the
head.  It is matter of doubt, moreover, to no one, that the church of
the apostles is the mother of all the churches, from whose ordinances it
is not right that you should deviate to any extent.  And as the Son of
God came to do the Father’s will, so shall ye fulfil the will of your
mother, which is the Church, the head of which, as has been stated
already, is the church of Rome.  Wherefore, whatsoever may be done
against the discipline of this church, without the decision of justice,
cannot on any account be permitted to be held valid.
