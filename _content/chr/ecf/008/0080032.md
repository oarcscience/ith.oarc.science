id="v.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The True Virgin.</span>

<span id="v.iii.vii-p2"></span>Those, therefore, who imitate Christ,
imitate Him earnestly.  For those who have “put on Christ” <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347) in truth, express His likeness in
their thoughts, and in their whole life, and in all their behaviour:  in
word, and in deeds, and in patience, and in fortitude, and in knowledge,
and in chastity, and in long-suffering, and in a pure heart, and in
faith, and in hope, and in full and perfect love towards God.  No
virgin, therefore, unless they be in everything as Christ, and as those
“who are Christs,” <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348) can be
saved.  For every virgin who is in God is holy in her body and in her
spirit, and is constant in the service of her Lord, not turning away
from it any whither, but waiting upon Him always in purity and holiness
in the Spirit of God, being “solicitous how she may please her
Lord,” <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349) *by living* purely and
without stain, and solicitous to be pleasing before Him in every thing. 
She who is such does not withdraw from our Lord, but in spirit is *ever*
with her Lord:  as it is written, “Be ye holy, as I am holy, saith the
Lord.” <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350)
