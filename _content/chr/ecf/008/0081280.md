<span id="vii.xiii.x-p1"></span> <span id="page_429">p. 429</span> <span
id="vii.xiii.x-Page_429"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter 9.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii.x-p2"></span>Then he summoned Nicodemus and the
twelve God-fearing Jews, and said to them:  What do you say that I
should do? because the people are in commotion.  They say:  We do not
know:  do as thou wilt; but what the people do, they do unjustly, in
order to kill him.  Pilate again went outside, and said to the people: 
You know that in the feasts of unleavened bread it is customary that I
free on your account one of the criminals kept in custody.  I have,
then, one malefactor in the prison, a robber named Barabbas.  I have
also Jesus, who has never done any evil.  Which of the two, then, do you
wish that I release to you?  The people answered:  Release to us
Barabbas.  Pilate says:  What then shall I do with Jesus?  They say: 
Let him be crucified. <span id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892)  
Again, others of them cried out:  If thou release Jesus, thou art no
friend of Cæsar, <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893) because he
calls himself Son of God, and king.  And if thou free him, he becomes a
king, and will take Cæsar’s kingdom.

<span id="vii.xiii.x-p5"></span>Pilate therefore was enraged, and said: 
Always has your nation been devilish <span
id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894) and unbelieving; and ever have you
been adversaries to your benefactors.  The Hebrews say:  And who were
our benefactors?  Pilate says:  God, who freed you out of the hand of
Pharaoh, and brought you through the Red Sea as upon dry land, and fed
you with quails, and gave you water to drink out of the dry rock, and
who gave you a law which, denying God you broke; and if Moses had not
stood and entreated God, you would have perished by a bitter death.  All
these, then, you have forgotten.  Thus also, even now, you say that I do
not at all love Cæsar, but hate him, and wish to plot against his
kingdom.

<span id="vii.xiii.x-p7"></span>And having thus spoken, Pilate rose up
from the throne with anger, wishing to flee from them.  The Jews
therefore cried out, saying:  We wish Cæsar to be king over us, not
Jesus, because Jesus received gifts <span
id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895) from the Magi.  And Herod also
heard this—that there was going to be a king—and wished to put him to
death, and for this purpose sent and put to death all the infants that
were in Bethlehem.  And on this account also his father Joseph and his
mother fled from fear of him into Egypt. <span
id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896)

<span id="vii.xiii.x-p10"></span>So then Pilate, hearing *this*,
silenced all the people, and said:  This, then, is the Jesus whom Herod
then sought that he might put him to death?  They say to him:  Yes. 
Pilate therefore, having ascertained that he was of the jurisdiction of
Herod, as being derived of the race of the Jews, sent Jesus to him.  And
Herod, seeing Him, rejoiced greatly, because he had been long desiring
to see Him, hearing of the miracles which He did.  He put on Him,
therefore, white garments.  Then he began to question Him.  But Jesus
did not give him an answer.  And Herod, wishing to see also some miracle
or other done by Jesus, and not seeing it, and also because He did not
answer him a single word, sent Him back again to Pilate. <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897)   Pilate, seeing this, ordered his
officers to bring water.  Washing, then, his hands with the water, he
said to the people:  I am innocent of the blood of this good man.  See
you to it, that he is unjustly put to death, since neither I have found
a fault in him, nor Herod; for because of this he has sent him back
again to me.  The Jews said:  His blood be upon us, and upon our
children. <span id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898)

<span id="vii.xiii.x-p13"></span>Then Pilate sat down upon his throne to
pass sentence.  He gave order, therefore, and Jesus came before him. 
And they brought a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and a reed
into His right hand. <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899)   Then
he passed sentence, and said to Him:  Thy nation says, and testifies
against thee, that thou wishest to be a king.  Therefore I decree that
they shall beat thee first with a rod forty strokes, as the laws of the
kings decree, and that they shall mock thee; and finally, that they
shall crucify thee.
