<span id="vi.iv.v.xix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.v.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Justa, a Proselyte.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xix-p2"></span>“There is amongst us one Justa, a
Syro-Phœnician, by race a Canaanite, whose daughter was oppressed with a
grievous disease. <span id="fr_926"></span>[927](#fn_926)   And she came
to our Lord, crying out, and entreating that He would heal her
daughter.  But He, being asked also by us, said, ‘It is not lawful to
heal the Gentiles, who are like to dogs on account of their using
various <span id="fr_927"></span>[928](#fn_927) meats and practices,
while the table in the kingdom has been given to the sons of Israel.’ 
But she, hearing this, and begging to partake like a dog of the crumbs
that fall from this table, having changed what she was, <span
id="fr_928"></span>[929](#fn_928) by living like the sons of the
kingdom, she obtained healing for her daughter, as she asked.  For she
being a Gentile, and remaining in the same course of life, He would not
have healed had she remained a Gentile, on account of its not being
lawful to heal her as a Gentile. <span id="fr_929"></span>[930](#fn_929)
