<p class="c21"><a name="x.xiv-p3"></A>[<span class="c9"><a name="x.xiv-p3.1"></A>a.d.</span> 211.]&#160; He was a most eloquent man, according to St. Jerome; and his writings against Montanism were so forcible as to call forth Tertullian himself, to confute him, if possible.&#160; He flourished under Commodus and Severus, and probably until the times of Caracalla.&#160; He bears testimony to the existence of a canon of Scripture,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3796"></A><A HREF="#fn_3796"><FONT SIZE="1">3797</FONT></A>
 and to its inspired authority as the rule of faith and practice; and he witnesses, by citation, to the Gospel of St. Matthew.&#160; The Revelation of St. John also, according to Eusebius, was employed by him in his works; and he preserves a tradition that our Lord bade the Apostles continue in Jerusalem for the space of twelve years.&#160; We cannot affirm that he was invested with any office in the Church.</p>

<p class="c21"><a name="x.xiv-p8"></A><span class="c9"><a name="x.xiv-p8.1"></A>But</span> who is this new teacher?&#160; His works and teaching inform <i>us</i>.&#160; This is he who taught the dissolution of marriage; who inculcated fasting; who called Peruga and Tymius, small towns of Phrygia, Jerusalem, because he wished to collect thither people from all parts; who set up exactors of money; who craftily contrives the taking of gifts under the name of voluntary offerings; who grants stipends to those who publish abroad his doctrine, that by means of gluttony the teaching of the doctrine may prevail.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="x.xiv-p9"></A><span class="c1"><a name="x.xiv-p9.1"></A>II.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="x.xiv-p10"></A>We declare to you, then, that these first prophetesses, as soon as they were filled with the spirit, left their husbands.&#160; Of what falsehood, then, were they guilty in calling Prisca a maiden!&#160; <A NAME="page_776"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 776</FONT></A> <a name="x.xiv-Page_776"></A>Do you not think that all Scripture forbids a prophet to receive gifts and money?&#160; When, therefore, I see that the prophetess has received gold and silver and expensive articles of dress, how can I avoid treating her with disapproval?</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="x.xiv-p11"></A><span class="c1"><a name="x.xiv-p11.1"></A>III.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="x.xiv-p12"></A>Moreover, Themison also, who was clothed in a garb of plausible&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3798"></A><A HREF="#fn_3798"><FONT SIZE="1">3799</FONT></A>
 covetousness, who declined to bear the sign of confessorship, but by a large sum of money put away from him the chains <i>of martyrdom</i>, although after such conduct it was his duty to conduct himself with humility, yet had the hardihood to boast that he was a martyr, and, in imitation of the apostle, to compose a general epistle, in which he attempted to instruct&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3799"></A><A HREF="#fn_3799"><FONT SIZE="1">3800</FONT></A>
 in the elements of the faith those who had believed to better purpose than he, and defended the doctrines of the new-fangled teaching,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3800"></A><A HREF="#fn_3800"><FONT SIZE="1">3801</FONT></A>
 and moreover uttered blasphemy against the Lord and the apostles and the holy Church.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="x.xiv-p16"></A><span class="c1"><a name="x.xiv-p16.1"></A>IV.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="x.xiv-p17"></A>But, not to dwell further on these matters, let the prophetess tell us concerning Alexander, who calls himself a martyr, with whom she joins in banqueting; who himself also is worshipped by many;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3801"></A><A HREF="#fn_3801"><FONT SIZE="1">3802</FONT></A>
 whose robberies and other deeds of daring, for which he has been punished, it is not necessary for us to speak of, since the treasury&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3802"></A><A HREF="#fn_3802"><FONT SIZE="1">3803</FONT></A>
 has him in keeping.&#160; Which of them, then, condones the sins of the other?&#160; The prophet the robberies of the martyr, or the martyr the covetousness of the prophet?&#160; For whereas the Lord has said, &#8220;Provide not gold, nor silver, nor two coats <i>a-piece</i>,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3803"></A><A HREF="#fn_3803"><FONT SIZE="1">3804</FONT></A>
 these men have, on the flat contrary, transgressed the command by the acquisition of these forbidden things.&#160; For we shall show that those who are called among them prophets and martyrs obtain money not only from the rich, but also from the poor, from orphans and widows.&#160; And if they are confident <i>that they are right</i> in so doing, let them stand <i>forward</i> and discuss <i>the point</i>, in order that, if they be refuted, they may cease for the future so to transgress.&#160; For the fruits of the prophet must needs be brought to the test:&#160; for &#8220;from its fruit is the tree known.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3804"></A><A HREF="#fn_3804"><FONT SIZE="1">3805</FONT></A>
&#160; But that those that desire it may become acquainted with what relates to Alexander, he was condemned by &AElig;milius Frontinus, proconsul at Ephesus, not on account of the name <i>of Christ</i>, but for the daring robberies he committed when he was already a transgressor.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3805"></A><A HREF="#fn_3805"><FONT SIZE="1">3806</FONT></A>
&#160; Afterwards, when he had spoken falsely of the name of the Lord, he was released, having deceived the faithful there;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3806"></A><A HREF="#fn_3806"><FONT SIZE="1">3807</FONT></A>
 and <i>even the brethren of</i> his own district,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3807"></A><A HREF="#fn_3807"><FONT SIZE="1">3808</FONT></A>
 from which he came, did not receive him, because he was a robber.&#160; Thus, those who wish to learn what he is, have the public treasury of Asia to go to.&#160; And yet the prophet, although he spent many years with him, knows <i>forsooth</i> nothing about him!&#160; By convicting &#8220;him,&#8221; we by his means clearly convict of misrepresentation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3808"></A><A HREF="#fn_3808"><FONT SIZE="1">3809</FONT></A>
 the prophet likewise.&#160; We are able to prove the like in the case of many <i>others</i> besides.&#160; And if they are confident <i>of their innocence</i>, let them abide the test.</p> 
<p class="c34"><a name="x.xiv-p26"></A><span class="c1"><a name="x.xiv-p26.1"></A>V.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="x.xiv-p27"></A>If they deny that their prophets have taken gifts, let them confess thus much, that if they be convicted of having taken them, they are not prophets; and we will adduce ten thousand proofs <i>that they have</i>.&#160; It is proper, too, that all the fruits of a prophet should be examined.&#160; Tell me:&#160; does a prophet dye <i>his hair?</i>&#160; Does a prophet use stibium <i>on his eyes?</i>&#160; Is a prophet fond of dress?&#160; Does a prophet play at gaming-tables and dice?&#160; Does a prophet lend money on interest?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3809"></A><A HREF="#fn_3809"><FONT SIZE="1">3810</FONT></A>
&#160; Let them confess whether these things are allowable or not.&#160; For my part, I will prove that these practices have occurred among them.</p>
