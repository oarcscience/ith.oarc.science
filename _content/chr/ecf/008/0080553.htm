<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.xlv-p2"></A>&#8220;Wherefore, let no one of you longer dissemble nor look backwards, but willingly approach to the Gospel of the kingdom of God.&#160; Let not the poor man say, When I shall become rich, then I shall be converted.&#160; God does not ask money of you, but a merciful heart and a pious mind.&#160; Nor let the rich man delay his conversion by reason of worldly care, while he thinks how he may dispose the abundance of his fruits; nor say within himself, &#145;What shall I do? where shall I bestow my fruits?&#146;&#160; Nor say to his soul, &#145;Thou hast much goods laid up for many years; feast and rejoice.&#146;&#160; For it shall be said to him, &#145;Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be taken from thee, and whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_876"><FONT SIZE="1">877</FONT></A>
&#160; Therefore let every age, every sex, every condition, haste to repentance, that they may obtain eternal life.&#160; Let the young be thankful that they put their necks under the yoke of discipline in the very violence of their desires.&#160; The old also are themselves praise-worthy, because they change for the fear of God, the custom of a long time in which they have been unhappily occupied.</p>
