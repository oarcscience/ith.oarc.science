<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.vii-p2"></A>And Appion met us, not only with the two companions just named, but with about thirty other men.&#160; And as soon as he saw me, he saluted and kissed me, and said, &#8220;This is Clement, of whose noble birth and liberal education I have often told you; for he, being related to the family of Tiberius C&aelig;sar, and equipped with all Grecian learning, has been seduced by a certain barbarian called Peter to speak and act after the manner of the Jews.&#160; Wherefore I beg of you to strive together with me for the setting of him right.&#160; And in your presence I now ask him.&#160; Let him tell me, since he thinks that he has devoted himself to piety, whether he is not acting most impiously, in forsaking the customs of his country, and falling away to those of the barbarians.&#8221;</p>
