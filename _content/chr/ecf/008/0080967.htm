<p class="c35"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxxiii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxxiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXXIII.&#8212;The Queen of the South and the Men of Nineveh.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxxiii-p2"></A>&#8220;But that indeed in the day of judgment the doings of those who have known the truth are compared with the good deeds of those who have been in error, the unlying One Himself has taught us, saying to those who neglected to come and listen to Him, &#145;The queen of the south shall rise up with this generation, and shall condemn it; because she came from the extremities of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon:&#160; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here,&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1135"></A><A HREF="#fn_1135"><FONT SIZE="1">1136</FONT></A>
 and ye do not believe Him.&#160; And to those amongst the people who would not repent at His preaching He said, &#145;The men of Nineveh shall rise up with this generation and shall condemn it, for they heard and repented on the preaching of Jonas:&#160; and behold, a greater is here, and no one believes.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1136"></A><A HREF="#fn_1136"><FONT SIZE="1">1137</FONT></A>
&#160; And thus, setting over against all their impiety those from among the Gentiles who have done <i>well</i>, in order to condemn those who, possessing the true religion, had not acted so well as those who were in error, he exhorted those having reason not only to do equally with the Gentiles whatsoever things are excellent, but more than they.&#160; And this speech has been suggested to me, taking occasion from the necessity of respecting the separation, and of washing after copulation, and of not denying such purity, though those who are in error do the same, since those who in error do well, without being saved, are for the condemnation of those who are in the worship of God, <i>and do ill;</i> because their respect for purity is through error, and not through the worship of the true Father and God of all.&#8221;</p>
