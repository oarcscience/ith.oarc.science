<span id="vi.iv.i-p6"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.i-p6.1"></span>We</span> have already given an account of the
*Clementines* in the Introductory Notice to the *Recognitions*. <span
id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887)   All that remains for us to do here,
is to notice the principal editions of the *Homilies*.  The first
edition was published by Cotelerius in his collection of the *Apostolic
Fathers*, from a manuscript in the Royal Library at Paris, the only
manuscript of the work then known to exist.  He derived assistance from
an epitome of the work which he found in the same library.  The text of
Cotelerius was revised by Clericus in his edition of Cotelerius, but
more carefully by Schwegler, Stuttgart, 1847.  The Paris <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.i-p7.1"></span>ms.</span> breaks off in the
middle of the fourteenth chapter of the nineteenth book.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p8"></span>In 1853 (Göttingen) Dressel published a new
recension of the *Homilies*, having found a complete manuscript of the
twenty Homilies in the Ottobonian Library in Rome.  In 1859 (Leipzig) he
published an edition of two Epitomes of the Homilies,—the one previously
edited by Turnebus and Cotelerius being given more fully, and the other
appearing for the first time.  To these Epitomes were appended notes by
Frederic Wieseler on the Homilies.  The last edition of the
*Clementines* is by Paul de Lagarde (Leipzig, 1865), which has no new
sources, is pretentious, but far from accurate.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p7"></span> \[The reader is referred to the
Introductory Notice prefixed to this edition of the Clementine
literature for a brief summary of the views respecting the relations of
the two principal works.  The footnotes throughout will aid in making a
comparison.  The preparation of these notes has strengthened the
conviction of the writer that the *Recognitions* are not dependent on
the *Homilies*, but that the reverse may be true.—R.\]
