<span id="vii.xiv.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiv.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4 (20).</span>

<span id="vii.xiv.iv-p2"></span>And when all were in such joy, came
Satan the heir of darkness, and said to Hades:  O all-devouring and
insatiable, hear my words.  There is of the race of the Jews one named
Jesus, calling himself the Son of God; and being a man, by our working
with them the Jews have crucified him:  and now when he is dead, be
ready that we may secure him here.  For I know that he is a man, and I
heard him also saying, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto
death. <span id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940)   He has also done me
many evils when living with mortals in the upper world.  For wherever he
found my servants, he persecuted them; and whatever men I made crooked,
blind, lame, lepers, or any such thing, by a single word he healed them;
and many whom I had got ready to be buried, even these through a single
word he brought to life again.

<span id="vii.xiv.iv-p4"></span>Hades says:  And is this *man* so
powerful as to do such things by a single word? or if he be so, canst
thou withstand him?  It seems to me that, if he be so, no one will be
able to withstand him.  And if thou sayest that thou didst hear him
dreading death, he said this mocking thee, and laughing, wishing to
seize thee with the strong hand; and woe, woe to thee, to all eternity!

<span id="vii.xiv.iv-p5"></span>Satan says:  O all-devouring and
insatiable Hades, art thou so afraid at hearing of our common enemy?  I
was not afraid of him, but worked in the Jews, and they crucified him,
and gave him also to drink gall with vinegar. <span
id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941)   Make ready, then, in order that
you may lay fast hold of him when he comes.

<span id="vii.xiv.iv-p7"></span>Hades answered:  Heir of darkness, son
of destruction, devil, thou hast just now told me that many whom thou
hadst made ready to be buried, be brought to life again by a single
word.  And if he has delivered others from the tomb, how and with what
power shall he be laid hold of by us?  For I not long ago swallowed down
one dead, Lazarus by name; and not long after, one of the living by a
single word dragged him up by force out of my bowels:  and I think that
it was he of whom thou speakest.  If, therefore, we receive him here, I
am afraid lest perchance we be in danger even about the rest.  For, lo,
all those that I have swallowed from eternity I perceive to be in
commotion, and I am pained in my belly.  And the snatching away of
Lazarus beforehand seems to me to be no good sign:  for not like a dead
body, but like an eagle, he flew out of me; for so suddenly did the
earth throw him out.  Wherefore also I adjure even thee, for thy benefit
and for mine, not to bring him here; for I think that he is coming here
to raise all the dead.  And this I tell thee:  by the darkness in which
we live, if thou bring him here, not one of the dead will be left behind
in it to me.
