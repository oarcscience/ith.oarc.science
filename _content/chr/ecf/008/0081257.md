<span id="vii.xii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.</span>

<span id="vii.xii.v-p2"></span>And leaving Jesus within the prætorium,
Pilate went out to the Jews, and said to them:  I find no fault in him. 
The Jews say to him:  He said, I can destroy this temple, and in three
days build it.  Pilate says:  What temple?  The Jews say:  The one that
Solomon <span id="fr_1819"></span>[1820](#fn_1819) built in forty-six
years, and this man speaks of pulling it down and building it in three
days.  Pilate says to them:  I am innocent of the blood of this just
man.  See you to it.  The Jews say:  His blood be upon us, and upon our
children.

<span id="vii.xii.v-p4"></span>And Pilate having summoned the elders and
priests and Levites, said to them privately:  Do not act thus, because
no charge that you bring against him is worthy of death; for your charge
is about curing and Sabbath profanation.  The elders and the priests and
the Levites say:  If <span id="page_419">p. 419</span> <span
id="vii.xii.v-Page_419"></span>any one speak evil against Cæsar, is he
worthy of death or not?  Pilate says:  He is worthy of death.  The Jews
say to Pilate:  If any one speak evil against Cæsar, he is worthy of
death; but this man has spoken evil against God.

<span id="vii.xii.v-p5"></span>And the procurator ordered the Jews to go
outside of the prætorium; and summoning Jesus, he says to Him:  What
shall I do to thee?  Jesus says to Pilate:  As it has been given to
thee.  Pilate says:  How given?  Jesus says:  Moses and the prophets
have proclaimed beforehand of my death and resurrection.  And the Jews
noticing this, and hearing it, say to Pilate:  What more wilt thou hear
of this blasphemy?  Pilate says to the Jews:  If these words be
blasphemous, do you take him for the blasphemy, and lead him away to
your synagogue, and judge him according to your law.  The Jews say to
Pilate:  Our law bears that a man who wrongs his fellow-men is worthy to
receive forty save one; but he that blasphemeth God is to be stoned with
stones. <span id="fr_1820"></span>[1821](#fn_1820)

<span id="vii.xii.v-p7"></span>Pilate says to them:  Do you take him,
and punish him in whatever way you please.  The Jews say to Pilate:  We
wish that he be crucified.  Pilate says:  He is not deserving of
crucifixion.

<span id="vii.xii.v-p8"></span>And the procurator, looking round upon
the crowds of the Jews standing by, sees many of the Jews weeping, and
says:  All the multitude do not wish him to die.  The elders of the Jews
say:  For this reason all the multitude of us have come, that he should
die.  Pilate says to the Jews:  Why should he die?  The Jews say: 
Because he called himself Son of God, and King.
