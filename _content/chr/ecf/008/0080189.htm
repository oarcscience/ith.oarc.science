<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.lii-p2"></A>Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;I wonder how you have been able to learn more from the law than the law was able to know or to teach; and how you say that you adduce proofs from the law of those things which you are pleased to assert, when you declare that neither the law, nor He who gave the law&#8212;that is, the Creator of the world&#8212;knows those things of which you speak!&#160; But this also I wonder at, how you, who alone know these things, should be standing here now with us all, circumscribed by the limits of this small court.&#8221;&#160; Then Simon, seeing Peter and all the people laughing, said:&#160; &#8220;Do you laugh, Peter, while so great and lofty matters are under discussion?&#8221;&#160; Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;Be not enraged, Simon, for we are doing no more than keeping our promise:&#160; for we are neither shutting our ears, as you said, nor did we take to flight as soon as we heard you propound your unutterable things; but we have not even stirred from the place.&#160; For indeed you do not even propound things that have any resemblance to truth, which might to a certain extent frighten us.&#160; Yet, at all events, disclose to us the meaning of this saying, how from the law you have learned of a God whom the law itself does not know, and of whom He who gave the law is ignorant.&#8221;&#160; Then Simon said:&#160; &#8220;If you have done laughing, I shall prove it by clear assertions.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Assuredly I shall give over, that I may learn from you how you have learned from the law what neither the law nor the God of the law Himself knows.&#8221;</p>
