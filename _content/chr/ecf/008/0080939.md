of These.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.v-p2"></span>“Can it therefore be said that, for the
sake of piety towards God, ye worship every form, while in all things ye
injure man who is really the image of God, committing murder, adultery,
stealing, and dishonouring him in many other respects?  But you ought
not to do even one evil thing on account of which man is grieved.  But
now you do all things on account of which man is disheartened, for wrong
is also distress.  Wherefore you murder and spoil his goods, and
whatever else you know which you would not receive from another.  But
you, being seduced by some malignant reptile to malice, by the
suggestion of polytheistic doctrine, are impious towards the real image,
which is man, and think that ye are pious towards senseless things.
