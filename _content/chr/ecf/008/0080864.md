id="vi.iv.xi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Concealment and
Revelation.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.vi-p2"></span>“For on this account Jesus is concealed
from the Jews, who have taken Moses as their teacher, and Moses is
hidden from those who have believed Jesus.  For, there being one
teaching by both, God accepts him who has believed either of these.  But
believing a teacher is for the sake of doing the things spoken by God. 
And that this is so our Lord Himself says, ‘I thank thee, Father of
heaven and earth, because Thou hast concealed these things from the wise
and elder, and hast revealed them to sucking babes.’ <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[1093](#fn_1092)   Thus God Himself has concealed a
teacher from some, as foreknowing what they ought to do, and has
revealed him to others, who are ignorant what they ought to do.
