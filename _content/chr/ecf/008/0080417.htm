<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xi-p2"></A>&#8220;Now, if it be taught that there is a providence, and that the world was made by it, other questions meet us which must be discussed.&#160; For it will be asked, In what way providence acts, whether generally towards the whole, or specially towards the parts, or generally also towards the parts, or both generally towards the whole, and specially towards the parts?&#160; But by general providence we mean this:&#160; as if God, at first making the world, has given an order and appointed a course to things, and has ceased to take any further care of what is done.&#160; But special providence towards the parts is of this sort, that He exercises providence over some men or places, but not over others.&#160; But general over all, and at the same time special over the parts, is in this wise:&#160; if God made all things at first, and exercises providence over each individual even to the end, and renders to every one according to his deeds.</p>
