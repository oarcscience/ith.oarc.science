<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xiv-p2"></A>And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;But what if matter, being coeval with Him, and possessing equal power, produces as His foe leaders who hinder His wishes?&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;If matter is eternal, then it is the foe of no one:&#160; for that which exists for ever is impassible, and what is impassible is blessed; but what is blessed cannot be receptive of hatred, since, on account of its eternal creation,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1432"></A><A HREF="#fn_1432"><FONT SIZE="1">1433</FONT></A>
