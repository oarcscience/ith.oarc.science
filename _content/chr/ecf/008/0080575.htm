<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lxvii-p2"></A>Whilst he made these and similar statements, the people began to curse him, and to weep and lament because they had sinned against Peter, believing him to be a magician or wicked man.&#160; But the same day, at evening, Faustinianus had his own face restored to him, and the appearance of Simon Magus left him.&#160; Now Simon, hearing that his face on Faustinianus had contributed to the glory of Peter, came in haste to anticipate Peter, and intending to cause by his art that his likeness should be taken from Faustinianus, when Christ had already accomplished this according to the word of His apostle.&#160; But Niceta and Aquila, seeing their father&#146;s face restored after the necessary proclamation, gave thanks to God, and would not suffer him to address the people any more.</p>
