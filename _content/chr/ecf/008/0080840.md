id="vi.iv.ix.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Their Contemporaries,
Therefore, Did Not Look on Them as Gods.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xxii-p2"></span>“Thus, to right-thinking men, it is
clear that they were admitted to be mortals.  And their contemporaries,
knowing that they were mortal, <span id="page_267">p. 267</span> <span
id="vi.iv.ix.xxii-Page_267"></span>when they died paid them no more
heed; and it was length of time which clothed them with the glory of
gods.  Nor need you wonder that they who lived in the times of
Æsculapius and Hercules were deceived, or the contemporaries of Dionysus
or any other of the men of that time, when even Hector in Ilium, and
Achilles in the island of Leuce, are worshipped by the inhabitants of
those places; and the Opuntines worship Patroclus, and the Rhodians
Alexander of Macedon. <span id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077)
