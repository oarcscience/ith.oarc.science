<span id="vii.xxiii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xxiii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2.</span>

<span id="vii.xxiii.ii-p2"></span>And on the following day, the fourth
day of the week, they brought Him at the ninth hour into the hall of
Caiaphas.  And Annas and Caiaphas say to Him:  Tell us, why hast thou
stolen our law, and renounced <span id="fr_2035"></span>[2036](#fn_2035)
the ordinances of Moses and the prophets?  And Jesus answered nothing. 
And again a second time, the multitude also being present, they say to
Him:  The sanctuary which Solomon built in forty and six years, why dost
thou wish to destroy in one moment?  And to these things Jesus answered
nothing.  For the sanctuary of the synagogue had been plundered by the
robber.

<span id="vii.xxiii.ii-p4"></span><span id="page_469">p. 469</span>
<span id="vii.xxiii.ii-Page_469"></span>And the evening of the fourth
day being ended, all the multitude sought to burn the daughter of
Caiaphas, on account of the loss of the law; for they did not know how
they were to keep the passover.  And she said to them:  Wait, my
children, and let us destroy this Jesus, and the law will be found, and
the holy feast will be fully accomplished.  And secretly Annas and
Caiaphas gave considerable money to Judas Iscariot, saying:  Say as thou
saidst to us before, I know that the law has been stolen by Jesus, that
the accusation may be turned against him, and not against this maiden,
who is free from blame.  And Judas having received this command, said to
them:  Let not all the multitude know that I have been instructed by you
to do this against Jesus; but release Jesus, and I persuade the
multitude that it is so.  And craftily they released Jesus.

<span id="vii.xxiii.ii-p5"></span>And Judas, going into the sanctuary at
the dawn of the fifth day, says to all the people:  What will you give
me, and I will give up to you the overthrower <span
id="fr_2036"></span>[2037](#fn_2036) of the law, and the plunderer of
the prophets?  The Jews say to him:  If thou wilt give him up to us, we
will give thee thirty pieces of gold.  And the people did not know that
Judas was speaking about Jesus, for many of them confessed that he was
the Son of God.  And Judas received the thirty pieces of gold.

<span id="vii.xxiii.ii-p7"></span>And going out at the fourth hour, and
at the fifth, he finds Jesus walking in the street.  And as evening was
coming on, Judas says to the Jews:  Give me the aid of soldiers with
swords and staves, and I will give him up to you.  They therefore gave
him officers for the purpose of seizing Him.  And as they were going
along, Judas says to them:  Lay hold of the man whom I shall kiss, for
he has stolen the law and the prophets.  Going up to Jesus, therefore,
he kissed Him, saying:  Hail, Rabbi! it being the evening of the fifth
day.  And having laid hold of Him, they gave Him up to Caiaphas and the
chief priests, Judas saying:  This is he who stole the law and the
prophets.  And the Jews gave Jesus an unjust trial, saying:  Why hast
thou done these things?  And he answered nothing.

<span id="vii.xxiii.ii-p8"></span>And Nicodemus and I Joseph, seeing the
seat of the plagues, <span id="fr_2037"></span>[2038](#fn_2037) stood
off from them, not wishing to perish along with the counsel of the
ungodly.
