<span id="vii.xiii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii.v-p2"></span>Pilate therefore, leaving Christ alone,
went outside, and says to the Jews:  I find no fault in this man.  The
Jews answered:  Let us tell your highness what he said.  He said, I am
able to destroy the temple of God, and in three days to build it. 
Pilate says:  And what temple did he say that he was to destroy?  The
Hebrews say:  The temple of Solomon, which Solomon built in forty-six
years. <span id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879)

<span id="vii.xiii.v-p4"></span>Pilate says privately to the chief
priests and the scribes and the Pharisees:  I entreat you, do nothing
evil against this man; for if you do evil against him, you will do
unjustly:  for it is not just that such a man should die, who has done
great good to many men.  They said to Pilate:  <span id="page_428">p.
428</span> <span id="vii.xiii.v-Page_428"></span>If, my lord, he who has
dishonoured Cæsar is worthy of death, how much more this *man* who
dishonours God!

<span id="vii.xiii.v-p5"></span>Then Pilate dismissed them, and they all
went outside.  Thereupon he says to Jesus:  What dost thou wish that I
shall do to thee?  Jesus says to Pilate:  Do to me as is determined. 
Pilate says:  How is it determined?  Jesus answered:  Moses and the
prophets wrote about me being crucified, and rising again.  The Hebrews,
hearing *this*, said to Pilate:  Why do you seek to hear a greater
insult out of him against God?  Pilate says:  These words are not an
insult against God, since they are written in the books of the
prophets.  The Hebrews said:  Our Scripture says, If a man offend
against a man, that is to say, if he insult him, he is worthy to receive
forty strokes with a rod; but if any one insult God, to be stoned. <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880)

<span id="vii.xiii.v-p7"></span>Then came a messenger from Procle, the
wife of Pilate, to him; and the message said:  Take care that thou do
not agree that any evil should happen to Jesus the good man; because
during this night I have seen fearful dreams on account of him. <span
id="fr_1881"></span>[1882](#fn_1881)   And Pilate spoke to the Hebrews,
saying:  If you hold as insult against God the words which you declare
Jesus to have spoken, take and judge him yourselves according to your
law. <span id="fr_1882"></span>[1883](#fn_1882)   The Jews said to
Pilate:  We wish that you should crucify him.  Pilate says:  This is not
good.

<span id="vii.xiii.v-p10"></span>And Pilate, turning towards the people,
saw many weeping, and said:  To me it seems that it is not the wish of
all the people that this man should die.  The priests and the scribes
say:  We on this account have brought all the people, that thou mightst
have full conviction that all wish his death.  Pilate says:  For what
evil hath he done?  The Hebrews said:  He says that he is a king, and
the Son of God.
