<span id="vi.iv.xi.ii-p2"></span>But he, when he was at the very gate of
his lodging, turned round, and promised to the multitudes that after the
next day he would converse with them on the subject of religion.  And
when he had gone in, the forerunners assigned lodgings to those who had
come with him.  And the hosts and the entertainers did not fall short of
the desire of those who sought hospitality.  But Peter, knowing nothing
of this, being asked by us to partake of food, said that he would not
himself partake until those who had come with him were settled.  And on
our assuring him that this was already done, all having received them
eagerly by reason of their affection towards him, so that those were
grieved beyond measure who had no guests to entertain,—Peter hearing
this, and being pleased with their eager philanthropy, blessed them and
went out, and having bathed in the sea, partook of food with the
forerunners; and then, the evening having come, he slept.
