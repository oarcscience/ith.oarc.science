 Niceta and Aquila suddenly started up, and being astonished, began to be greatly agitated, saying:&#160; &#8220;O Lord, Thou Ruler and God of all, are these things true, or are we in a dream?&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Unless we be mad, these things are true.&#8221;&#160; But they, after a short pause, and wiping their faces, <A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.ix.xxviii-Page_163"></A>said:&#160; &#8220;We are Faustinus and Faustus:&#160; and even at the first, when you began this narrative, we immediately fell into a suspicion that the matters that you spoke of might perhaps relate to us; yet again considering that many like things happen in men&#146;s lives, we kept silence, although our hearts were struck by some hope.&#160; Therefore we waited for the end of your story, that, if it were entirely manifest that it related to us, we might then confess it.&#8221;&#160; And when they had thus spoken, they went in weeping to our mother.&#160; And when they found her asleep, and wished to embrace her, Peter prevented them, saying:&#160; &#8220;Permit me first to prepare your mother&#146;s mind, lest haply by the great and sudden joy she lose her reason, and her understanding be disturbed, especially as she is now stupefied with sleep.&#8221;</p>
