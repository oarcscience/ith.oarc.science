id="vi.iii.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—Intercourse with
Barnabas.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.x-p2"></span>While I was urging these and similar
arguments, a great excitement was stirred up amongst the bystanders,
some being moved with pity as towards a stranger, and approving my
speech as in accordance with that feeling; others, petulant and stolid,
rousing the anger of their undisciplined minds as much against me as
against Barnabas.  But as the day was declining to evening, I laid hold
of Barnabas by the right hand, and led him away, although reluctantly,
to my house; and there I made him remain, lest perchance <span

of the rude rabble should lay hands upon him.  While we were thus placed
in contact for a few days, I gladly heard him discoursing the word of
truth; yet he hastened his departure, saying that he must by all means
celebrate at Judæa a festal day of his religion which was approaching,
and that there he should remain in future with his countrymen and his
brethren, evidently indicating that he was horrified at the wrong that
had been done to him.
