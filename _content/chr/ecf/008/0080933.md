<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xxvi-p2"></span>Having said this, he ordered the
demoniacs, and those taken with diseases, to be brought to him; and when
they were brought, he laid his hands on them, and prayed, and dismissed
them healed, reminding them and the rest of the multitude to attend upon
him there every day that he should discourse.  Then, when the others had
withdrawn, Peter bathed in the reservoir that was there, with those who
pleased; and then ordering a table to be spread on the ground under the
thick foliage of the trees, for the sake of shade, he ordered us each to
recline, according to our worth; and thus we partook of food.  Therefore
having blessed and having given thanks to God for the enjoyment,
according to the accustomed faith of the Hebrews; and there being still
a long time before us, he permitted us to ask him questions about
whatever we pleased; and thus, though there were twenty of us putting
questions to him all round, he satisfied every one.  And now evening
having descended, we all went with him into the largest apartment of the
lodging, and there we all slept.
