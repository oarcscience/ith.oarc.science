id="vi.iii.iii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVI.—Anointing.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xlvi-p2"></span>“But now also I shall, by a very
short representation, recall you to the recollection of all these
things.  In the present life, Aaron, the first high priest, <span
id="fr_578"></span>[579](#fn_578) was anointed with a composition of
chrism, which was made after the pattern of that spiritual ointment of
which we have spoken before.  He was prince of the people, and as a king
received first-fruits and tribute from the people, man by man; and
having undertaken the office <span id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.xlvi-Page_90"></span>of judging the people, he judged of
things clean and things unclean.  But if any one else was anointed with
the same ointment, as deriving virtue from it, he became either king, or
prophet, or priest.  If, then, this temporal grace, compounded by men,
had such efficacy, consider now how potent was that ointment extracted
by God from a branch of the tree of life, when that which was made by
men could confer so excellent dignities among men.  For what in the
present age is more glorious than a prophet, more illustrious than a
priest, more exalted than a king?”
