<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xli-p2"></A>Peter, therefore, rising at the usual hour of the night, found us waking; and when, saluting us, in his usual manner, he had taken his seat, first of all Niceta, said:&#160; &#8220;If you will permit me, my lord Peter, I have something to ask of you.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;I permit not only you, but all, and not only now, but always, that every one confess what moves him, and the part in his mind that is pained, in order that he may obtain healing.&#160; For things which are covered with silence, and are not made known to us, are cured with difficulty, like maladies of long standing; and therefore, since the medicine of seasonable and necessary discourse cannot easily be applied to those who keep silence, every one ought to declare in what respect his mind is feeble through ignorance.&#160; But to him who keeps silence, it belongs to God alone to give a remedy.&#160; We indeed also can do it, but by the lapse of a long time.&#160; For it is necessary than the discourse of doctrine, proceeding in order from the beginning, and meeting each single question, should disclose all things, and resolve and reach to all things, even to that which every one required in his mind; but that, as I have said, can only be done in the course of a long time.&#160; Now, then, ask what you please.&#8221;</p>
