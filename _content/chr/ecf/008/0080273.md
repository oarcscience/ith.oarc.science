id="vi.iii.v.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXIII.—Tidings of Simon.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.lxiii-p2"></span>But in those days a letter was
received from the brethren who had gone before, in which were detailed
the crimes of Simon, how going from city to city he was deceiving
multitudes, and everywhere maligning Peter, so that, when he should
come, no one might afford him a hearing.  For he asserted that Peter was
a magician, a godless man, injurious, cunning, ignorant, and professing
impossible things.  “For,” says he, “he asserts that the dead shall rise
again, which is impossible.  But if any one attempts to confute him, he
is cut off by secret snares by him, through means of his attendants. 
Wherefore, I also,” says he, “when I had vanquished him and triumphed
over him, fled for fear of his snares, lest he should destroy me by
incantations, or compass my death by plots.”  They intimated also that
he mainly stayed at Tripolis. <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714)

represented as doing great miracles at Tyre.  Peter follows him there,
but finds that he has gone.  The long discussions with him are assigned
to Laodicea.  See *Homilies*, xvi., etc.—R.\]
