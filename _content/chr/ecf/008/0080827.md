id="vi.iv.ix.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Artemis.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.ix-p2"></span>“And Hera we understand to be a happy
tempering of the atmosphere, and therefore she is very fruitful; but
Athena, as they call Pallas, was reckoned a virgin, because on account
of the intense heat she could produce nothing.  And in a similar fashion
Artemis is explained:  for her they take as the lowest depth of air, and
so they called her a virgin, because she could not bear anything on
account of the extreme cold.  And that troubled and drunken composition
which arises from the upper and lower vapours they called Dionysus, as
troubling the intellect.  And the water under the earth, which is in
nature indeed one, but which flows through all the paths of earth, and
is divided into many parts, they called Osiris, as being cut in pieces. 
And they understand Adonis as favourable seasons, Aphrodite as coition
and generation, Demeter as the earth, the Girl (Proserpine) as seeds;
and Dionysus some understand as the vine.
