<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xx-p2"></A>&#8220;Although this word <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xx-p2.1"></A>God</span> is not the <i>name</i> of God, but meantime that word is employed by men as His name; and therefore, as I have said, when it is used reproachfully, the reproach is referred to the injury of the true name.&#160; In short, the ancient Egyptians, who thought that they had discovered the theory of the heavenly revolutions and the nature of the stars, nevertheless, through the demon&#146;s blocking up their senses, subjected the incommunicable name to all kinds of indignity.&#160; For some taught that their ox, which is called Apis, ought to be worshipped; others taught that the he-goat, others that cats, the ibis, a fish also, a serpent, onions, drains, crepitus ventris, ought to be regarded as deities, and innumerable other things, which I am ashamed even to mention.&#8221;</p>
