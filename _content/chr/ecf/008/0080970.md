id="vi.iv.xiv.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI.—Farewell to
Tripolis.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxxvi-p2"></span>Having spoken thus, he sent the
harbingers into Antioch of Syria, bidding them expect him there
forthwith.  Then when they had gone, Peter having driven away diseases,
sufferings, and demons from great multitudes who were persuaded, and
having baptized them in the fountains which are near to the sea, and
having celebrated <span id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139) the
Eucharist, and having appointed Maroones, who had received him into his
house, and was now perfected, as their bishop, and having set apart
twelve elders, and having designated deacons, and arranged matters
relating to widows, and having discoursed on the common good what was
profitable for the ordering of the church, and having counselled them to
obey the bishop Maroones, three months being now fulfilled; he bade
those in Tripolis of Phœnicia farewell, and took his journey to Antioch
of Syria, all the people accompanying us with due honour.
