<span id="vi.iii.v.i-p4"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.v.i-p4.1"></span>Meantime</span> Peter, rising at the crowing
of the cock, and wishing to rouse us, found us awake, the evening light
still burning; and when, according to custom, he had saluted us, and we
had all sat down, he thus began.  “Nothing is more difficult, my
brethren, than to reason concerning the truth in the presence of a mixed
multitude of people.  For that which is may not be spoken to all as it
is, on account of those who hear wickedly and treacherously; yet it is
not proper to deceive, on account of those who desire to hear the truth
sincerely.  What, then, shall he do who has to address a mixed
multitude?  Shall he conceal what is true?  How, then, shall he instruct
those who are worthy?  But if he set forth pure truth to those who do
not desire to obtain salvation, he does injury to Him by whom he has
been sent, and from whom he has received commandment not to throw the
pearls of His words before swine and dogs, <span
id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674) who, striving against them with
arguments and sophisms, roll them in the mud of carnal understanding,
and by their barkings and base answers break and weary the preachers of
God’s word.  Wherefore I also, for the most part, by using a certain
circumlocution, endeavour to avoid publishing the chief knowledge
concerning the Supreme Divinity to unworthy ears.”  Then, beginning from
the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, he briefly and plainly
expounded to us, so that all of us hearing him wondered that men have
forsaken the truth, and have turned themselves to vanity.
