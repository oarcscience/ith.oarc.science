<span id="ix.xix.ii-p2"></span>(No verb is found in the lexicons, etc.,
note 3, p. 737.)

<span id="ix.xix.ii-p3"></span>The study of Syriac is just beginning to
be regarded as only less important to the theologian than that of the
Hebrew.  The twain will be found a help, each to the other, if one
pursues the study of the cognate languages together.  In fact, the Book
of Daniel demands such a preparation for its enjoyment and adequate
comprehension. <span id="fr_3524"></span>[3525](#fn_3524)   Let me
commend to every reader the <span id="page_743">p. 743</span> <span
id="ix.xix.ii-Page_743"></span>admirable example of Beveridge, who at
eighteen years of age produced a grammar of the Syriac language, and
also a Latin essay on the importance of cultivating this study, as that
of the vernacular of our Lord Himself.  This little treatise is worthy
of careful reading; and right worthy of note is the motto which he
prefixed to it,—“Estote imitatores mei, *sicut et ego sum Christi*” ([1
Cor. xi. 1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001)<span
id="ix.xix.ii-p4.1"></span>).

<span id="ix.xix.ii-p5"></span>When one thinks of the difficulties even
yet to be overcome in mastering the language,—the want of a complete
lexicon, etc., <span id="fr_3525"></span>[3526](#fn_3525) —it is
surprising to think of Beveridge’s pioneer labours in extreme youth. 
Gutbir’s *Lexicon Syriacum* had not yet appeared, nor his edition of the
Peshito, which preceded it, though Brian Walton’s great name and labours
were his noble stimulants.  Nobody can read the touching account which
Gutbir <span id="fr_3526"></span>[3527](#fn_3526) gives of his own
enthusiastic and self-sacrificing work, without feeling ashamed of the
slow progress of Oriental studies in the course of two centuries since
the illustrious Pocock gave his grand example to English scholarship. 
All honour to our countryman Dr. Murdock, who late in life entered upon
this charming pursuit, and called on others to follow him. <span
id="fr_3527"></span>[3528](#fn_3527)   May I not venture to hope that
even these specimens of what may be reaped from the field of Aramaic
literature may inspire my young countrymen to take the lead in
elucidating the Holy Scriptures from this almost unopened storehouse of
“treasures new and old”?

<span id="ix.xix.ii-p4"></span> It must not be inferred that I speak as
a Syriac scholar.  I have laboured unsuccessfully, and late in life, to
repair my sad neglect at an earlier period; and I can speak only as a
penitent.

personal expense, and set up the press and lodged the printers in his
own house.
