 some one ran in and said:&#160; &#8220;Appion Pleistonices has just come with Annubion from Antioch, and he is lodging with Simon.&#8221;&#160; And my father hearing this, and rejoicing, said to Peter:&#160; &#8220;If you permit me, I shall go to salute Appion and <A NAME="page_343"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 343</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xxiii.xi-Page_343"></A>Annubion, who have been my friends from childhood.&#160; For perchance I shall persuade Annubion to discuss genesis with Clement.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;I permit you, and I praise you for fulfilling the duties of a friend.&#160; But now consider how in the providence of God there come together from all quarters considerations which contribute to your full assurance, rendering the harmony complete.&#160; But I say this because the arrival of Annubion happens advantageously for you.&#8221;&#160; And my father:&#160; &#8220;In truth, I see that this is the case.&#8221;&#160; And saying this, he went to Simon.</p>
