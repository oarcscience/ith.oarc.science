id="vi.iv.vi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Spiritual
Adultery.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxviii-p2"></span>“Wherefore, it is fitting to hear
the one only Prophet of the truth, knowing that the word that is sown by
another bearing the charge of fornication, is, as it were, cast out by
the Bridegroom from His kingdom.  But to those who know the mystery,
death is also produced by spiritual adultery.  For whenever the soul is
sown by others, then it is forsaken by the Spirit, as guilty of
fornication or adultery; and so the living body, the life-giving Spirit
being withdrawn, is dissolved into dust, and the rightful punishment of
sin is suffered at the time of the judgment by the soul, after the
dissolution of the body; even as, among men, she who is caught in
adultery is first cast out from the house, and then afterwards is
condemned to punishment.”
