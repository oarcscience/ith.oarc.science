id="vi.iv.xxi.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Unrevealed God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.iv-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “How, then, if the
framer of the world, who also fashioned Adam, was known, and known too
by those who were just according to the law, and moreover by the just
and unjust, and the whole world, does your teacher, coming after all
these, say, <span id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374) ‘No one has known
the Father but the Son, even as no one knoweth the Son but the Father,
and those to whom the Son may wish to reveal Him?’  But he would not
have made this statement, had he not proclaimed a Father who was still
unrevealed, whom the law speaks of as the highest, and who has not given
any utterance either good or bad (as Jeremiah testifies in the
Lamentations <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375) ); who also,
limiting the nations to seventy languages, according to the number of
the sons of Israel who entered Egypt, and according to the boundaries of
these nations, gave to his own Son, who is also called Lord, and who
brought into order the heaven and the earth, the Hebrews as his portion,
and defined him to be God of gods, that is, of the gods who received the
other nations as their portions.  Laws, therefore, proceeded from all
the so-called gods to their own divisions, which consist of the other
nations.  In like manner also from the Son of the Lord of all came forth
the law which is established among the Hebrews.  And this state of
matters was determined on, that if any one should seek refuge in the law
of any one, he should belong to the division of him whose law he
undertook to obey.  No one knew the highest Father, who was unrevealed,
just as they did not know that his Son was his Son.  Accordingly at this
moment you yourself, in assigning the special attributes of the
unrevealed Most High to the Son, do not know that he is the Son, being
the Father of Jesus, who with you is called the Christ.”
