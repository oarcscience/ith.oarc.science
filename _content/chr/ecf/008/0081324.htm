<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvi.vi-p2"></A>When this was seen by Hades and Death, and their impious officers, along with their cruel servants, they trembled at perceiving in their own dominions the clearness of so great a light, when they saw Christ suddenly in their abodes; and they cried out, saying:&#160; We have been overcome by thee.&#160; Who art thou, that to the Lord directest our confusion?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1985"></A><A HREF="#fn_1985"><FONT SIZE="1">1986</FONT></A>
&#160; Who art thou, that, undestroyed by corruption, the uncorrupted proof of thy majesty, with fury condemnest our power?&#160; Who art thou, so great and little, lowly and exalted, soldier and commander, wonderful warrior in the form of a slave, and the king of glory dead and alive, whom slain the cross has carried?&#160; Thou, who didst lie dead in the sepulchre, hast come down to us alive; and in thy death every creature trembled, and the stars in a body were moved; and now thou hast been made free among the dead, and disturbest our legions.&#160; Who art thou, that settest free those who art held captive, bound by original sin, and recallest them to their former liberty?&#160; Who art thou, who sheddest a divine, and splendid, and illuminating light upon those who have been blinded by the darkness of their sins?</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvi.vi-p4"></A>In like manner, also, all the legions of the demons, terror-stricken with like fear from their fearful overthrow, cried out, saying:&#160; Whence art thou, O Jesus, a man so powerful and splendid in majesty, so excellent, without spot, and free from guilt?&#160; For that world of earth which has been subject to us always until now, which used to pay tribute for our uses, has never sent us such a dead man, has never destined such gifts for the powers below.&#160; Who therefore art thou, that hast <A NAME="page_451"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 451</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xvi.vi-Page_451"></A>so intrepidly entered our bounds, and who hast not only no fear of our punishments, but, moreover, attemptest to take all away from our chains?&#160; Perhaps thou art that Jesus of whom our prince Satan said, that by thy death of the cross thou wast destined to receive the dominion of the whole world.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvi.vi-p5"></A>Then the King of glory, trampling on death by His majesty, and seizing Prince Satan, delivered him to the power of Hades, and drew Adam to His brightness.</p>
