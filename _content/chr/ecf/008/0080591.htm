<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.ii-p2"></A>But about that time, when he was about to die, the brethren being assembled together, he suddenly seized my hand, and rose up, and said in presence of the church:&#160; &#8220;Hear me, brethren and fellow-servants.&#160; Since, as I have been taught by the Lord and Teacher Jesus Christ, whose apostle I am, the day of my death is approaching, I lay hands upon this Clement as your bishop; and to him I entrust my chair of discourse, even to him who has journeyed with me from the beginning to the end, and thus has heard all my homilies&#8212;who, in a word, having had a share in all my trials, has been found stedfast in the faith; whom I have found, above all others, pious, philanthropic, pure, learned, chaste, good, upright, large-hearted, and striving generously to bear the ingratitude of some of the catechumens.&#160; Wherefore I communicate to him the power of binding and loosing, so that with respect to everything which he shall ordain in the earth, it shall be decreed in the heavens.&#160; For he shall bind what ought to be bound, and loose what ought to be loosed, as knowing the role of the Church.&#160; Therefore hear him, as knowing that he who grieves the president of the truth, sins against Christ, and offends the Father of all.&#160; Wherefore he shall not live; and therefore it becomes him who presides to hold the place of a physician, and not to cherish the rage of an irrational beast.&#8221;</p>
