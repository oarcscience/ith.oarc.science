<span id="ix.v.ii-p2"></span>*From the teaching of Addæus the apostle,
which was spoken in the city of Edessa.* <span
id="fr_2944"></span>[2945](#fn_2944)

<span id="ix.v.ii-p4"></span>Ye know that I said unto you, that none of
the souls which go forth out of the bodies of men are under *the power
of* death, but that they all live and continue to exist, and that there
are for them mansions and an abode of rest.  For the reasoning *power*
of the soul does not cease, nor the knowledge, because it is the image
of the immortal God.  For it is not without perceptions, after the
manner of the bodily frame, which has no perception of that corruption
which has acquired dominion over it.  Recompense, however, and reward it
will not receive apart from its bodily form, because what it experiences
belongs not to itself alone, but to the bodily form also in which it
dwelt for a time.  But the disobedient, who have not known God, will
then repent without avail.
