<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxxvi-p2"></span>Then said Simon:  “Do not repeat
again and again your talk of peace, but expound briefly what it is that
you think or believe.”  Peter answered:  “Why are you afraid of hearing
frequently of peace? for do you not know that peace is the perfection of
law?  For wars and disputes spring from sins; and where there is no sin,
there is peace of soul; but where there is peace, truth is found in
disputations, righteousness in works.”  Then Simon:  “You seem to me not
to be able to profess what you think.”  Then Peter:  “I shall speak, but
according to my own judgment, not under constraint of your tricks.  For
I desire that what is salutary and profitable be brought to the
knowledge of all and therefore I shall not delay to state it as briefly
as possible.  There is one God; and He is the creator of the world, a
righteous judge, rendering to every one at some time or other according
to his deeds. <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628)   But now for the
assertion of these things I know that countless thousands of words can
be called forth.”
