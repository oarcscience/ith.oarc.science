<span id="vi.iii.ix.xv-p2"></span>Then the woman, hearing this welcome
promise, began to say:  “It is neither easy of belief, nor do I think it
necessary to tell, what is my extraction, or what is my country.  It is
enough <span id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span
id="vi.iii.ix.xv-Page_160"></span>only to explain the cause of my grief,
why I have rendered my hands powerless by gnawing them.  Being born of
noble parents, and having become the wife of a suitably powerful man, I
had two twin sons, and after them one other.  But my husband’s brother
was vehemently enflamed with unlawful love towards me; and as I valued
chastity above all things, and would neither consent to so great
wickedness, nor wished to disclose to my husband the baseness of his
brother, I considered whether in any way I could escape unpolluted, and
yet not set brother against brother, and so bring the whole race of a
noble family into disgrace.  I made up my mind, therefore, to leave my
country with my two twins, until the incestuous love should subside,
which the sight of me was fostering and inflaming; and I thought that
our other son should remain to comfort his father to some extent.
