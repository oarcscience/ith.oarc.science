id="vi.iii.x.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Power of Water.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xxvii-p2"></span>“But in this also the divine
providence is to be admired, that it permits us to see and know the
things that are made, but has placed in secrecy and concealment the way
and manner in which they are done, that they may not be competent to the
knowledge of the unworthy, but may be laid open to the worthy and
faithful, when they shall have deserved it.  But to prove by facts and
examples that nothing is imparted to seeds of the substance of the
earth, but that all depends upon the element of water, and the power of
the spirit which is in it,—suppose, for example, that a hundred talents’
weight of earth are placed in a very large trough, and that there are
sown in it several kinds of seeds, either of herbs or of shrubs, and
that water enough is supplied for watering them, and that that care is
taken for several years, and that the seeds which are gathered are
stored up, for example of corn or barley and other sorts separately from
year to year, until the seeds of each sort amount to a hundred talents’
weight, then also let the stalks be pulled up by the roots and weighed;
and after all these have been taken from the trough, let the earth be
weighed, it will still give back its hundred talents’ weight
undiminished. <span id="fr_815"></span>[816](#fn_815)   Whence, then,
shall we say that all that weight, and all <span id="page_173">p.
173</span> <span id="vi.iii.x.xxvii-Page_173"></span>the quantity of
different seeds and stalks, has come?  Does it not appear manifestly
that it has come from the water?  For the earth retains entire what is
its own, but the water which has been poured in all through is nowhere,
on account of the powerful virtue of the divine condition, which by the
one species of water both prepares the substances of so many seeds and
shrubs, and forms their species, and preserves the kind while
multiplying the increase.
