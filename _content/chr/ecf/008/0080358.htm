<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.viii.vii-p2"></A>&#8220;For it is certain that these images are made with iron tools; but iron is wrought by fire, which fire is extinguished by water.&#160; But water is moved by spirit; and spirit has its beginning from God.&#160; For thus saith the prophet Moses:&#160; &#145;In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.&#160; But the earth was invisible, and unarranged; and darkness was over the deep:&#160; and the Spirit of God was upon the waters.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_781"></A><A HREF="#fn_781"><FONT SIZE="1">782</FONT></A>
&#160; Which Spirit, like the Creator&#146;s hand, by command of God separated light from darkness; and after that invisible heaven produced this visible one, that He might make the higher places a habitation for angels, and the lower for men.&#160; For your sake, therefore, by command of God, the water which was upon the face of the earth withdrew, that the earth might produce fruits for you; and into the earth also He inserted veins of moisture, that fountains and rivers might flow forth from it for you.&#160; For your sake it was commanded to bring forth living creatures, and all things which could serve for your use and pleasure.&#160; Is it not for you that the winds blow, that the earth, conceiving by them, may bring forth fruits?&#160; Is it not for you that the showers fall, and the seasons change?&#160; Is it not for you that the sun rises and sets, and the moon undergoes her changes?&#160; For you the sea offers its service, that all things may be subject to you, ungrateful as you are.&#160; For all these things shall there not be a righteous punishment of vengeance, because beyond all else you are ignorant of the bestower of all these things, whom you ought to acknowledge and reverence above all?</p>
