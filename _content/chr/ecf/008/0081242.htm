<p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.vii-p2"></A>One day, when Jesus was climbing on a certain house, along with the children, He began to play with them.&#160; And one of the boys fell down through a back-door, and died immediately.&#160; And when the children saw this, they all ran away; but Jesus remained in the house.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1767"></A><A HREF="#fn_1767"><FONT SIZE="1">1768</FONT></A>
&#160; And when the parents of the boy who had died had come, they spoke against Jesus:&#160; Surely it was thou who made him fall down; and they reviled Him.&#160; And Jesus, coming down from the house, stood over the dead child, and with a loud voice called out the name of the child:&#160; Sinoo, Sinoo, rise and say whether it was I that made thee fall down.&#160; And suddenly he rose up, and said:&#160; No, my lord.&#160; And his parents, seeing such a great miracle done by Jesus, glorified God, and adored Jesus.</p>
