<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lv-p2"></A>&#8220;And when we saw no way of getting out of the difficulty, there came Cornelius the centurion, being sent by C&aelig;sar to the president of C&aelig;sarea on public business.&#160; Him we sent for alone, and told him the reason why we were sorrowful, and entreated him that, if he could do anything, he should help us.&#160; Then he most readily promised that he would straightway put him to flight, if only we would aid his plans.&#160; And when we promised that we would be active in doing everything, he said, &#145;C&aelig;sar has ordered sorcerers to be sought out and destroyed in the city of Rome and through the provinces, and a great number of them have been already destroyed.&#160; I shall therefore give out, through my friends, that I am come to apprehend that magician, and that I am sent by C&aelig;sar for this purpose, that he may be punished with the rest of his fraternity.&#160; Let your people, therefore, who are with him in disguise, intimate to him, as if they had heard it from some quarter, that I am sent to apprehend him; and when he hears this, he is sure to take to flight.&#160; Or if you think of anything better, tell me.&#160; Why need I say more?&#146;&#160; It was so done by those of ours who were with him, disguised for the purpose of acting as spies on him.&#160; And when Simon learned that this was come upon him, he received the information as a great kindness conferred upon him by them, and took to flight.&#160; He therefore departed from Antioch, and, as we have heard, came hither with Athenodorus.</p>
