<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.lxii-p2"></A>&#8220;But, further, let the things that are happening before your eyes persuade you; how wars are constantly arising through there being now many kings all over the earth.&#160; For each one holds the government of another as a pretext for war.&#160; But if one were universal superior, he, having no reason why he should make war, would have perpetual peace.&#160; In short, therefore, to those who are thought worthy of eternal life, God appoints one universal King in the world that shall then be, that by means of monarchy there may be unfailing peace.&#160; It behoves all, therefore, to follow some one as a leader, honouring him as the image of God; and it behoves the leader to be acquainted with the road that entereth into the holy city.</p>
