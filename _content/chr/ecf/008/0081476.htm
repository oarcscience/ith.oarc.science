<p class="c51"><a name="ix.xiii.vi-p3"></A>Abgar&#146;s letter to the Saviour Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.xiii.vi-p4"></A>&#8220;Abgar, son of Archam, prince of the land, to Jesus, Saviour and Benefactor of men, who has appeared in the country of Jerusalem, greeting:&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiii.vi-p5"></A>&#8220;I have heard of Thee, and of the cures wrought by Thy hands, without remedies, without herbs:&#160; for, as it is said, Thou makest the blind to see, the lame to walk, the lepers to be healed; Thou drivest out unclean spirits, Thou curest unhappy beings afflicted with prolonged and inveterate diseases; Thou dost even raise the dead.&#160; As I have heard of all these wonders wrought by Thee, I have concluded from them either that Thou art God, come down from heaven to do such great things, or that Thou art the Son of God, working as Thou dost these miracles.&#160; Therefore have I written to Thee, praying Thee to condescend to come to me and cure me of the complaints with which I am afflicted.&#160; I have heard also that the Jews murmur against Thee and wish to deliver Thee up to torments:&#160; I have a city small but pleasant, it would be sufficient for us both.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiii.vi-p6"></A>The messengers, the bearers of this letter, met Jesus at Jerusalem, a fact confirmed by these words of the Gospel:&#160; &#8220;Some from amongst the heathen came to find Jesus, but those who heard them, not daring to tell Jesus what they had heard, told it to Philip and Andrew, who repeated it all to their Master.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiii.vi-p7"></A>The Saviour did not then accept the invitation given to Him, but He thought fit to honour Abgar with an answer in these words:&#8212;</p>
