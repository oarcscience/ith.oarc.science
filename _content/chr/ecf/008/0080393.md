<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxvi-p2"></span>And when I had said this, Peter
began to relate the whole matter to them in order, <span
id="fr_796"></span>[797](#fn_796) and said, “When we had come to
Aradus, <span id="fr_797"></span>[798](#fn_797) and I had ordered you to
go on before us, the same day after you had gone, Clement was led in the
course of conversation to tell me of his extraction and his family, and
how he had been deprived of his parents, and had had twin brothers older
than himself, and that, as his father told him, his mother once saw a
vision, by which she was ordered to depart from the city of Rome with
her twin sons, else she and they should suddenly perish.  And when she
had told his father the dream, he, loving his sons with tender
affection, and afraid of any evil befalling them, put his wife and sons
on board a ship with all necessaries, and sent them to Athens to be
educated.  Afterwards he sent once and again persons to inquire after
them, but nowhere found even a trace of them.  At last the father
himself went on the search, and until now he is nowhere *to be found*. 
When Clement had given me this narrative, there came one to us, asking
us to go to the neighbouring island of Aradus, to see vine-wood columns
of wonderful size.  I consented; and when we came to the place, all the
rest went into the interior of the temple; but I—for what reason I know
not—had no mind to go farther.

between Aradus and Antaradus.  \[Aradus is the name of the Island,
Antaradus that of the neighbouring city.—R.\]
