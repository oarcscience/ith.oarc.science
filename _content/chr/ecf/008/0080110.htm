<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xlviii-p2"></A>Then Peter answered, with an appearance of indignation:&#160; &#8220;What! do you suppose, Clement, that all of us can know all things before the time?&#160; But not to be drawn aside now from our proposed discourse, we shall at another time, when your progress is more manifest, explain these things more distinctly.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xlviii-p3"></A>&#8220;Then, however, a priest or a prophet, being anointed with the compounded ointment, putting fire to the altar of God, was held illustrious in all the world.&#160; But after Aaron, who was a priest, another is taken out of the waters.&#160; I do not speak of Moses, but of Him who, in the waters of baptism, was called by God His Son.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">580</FONT></A>
&#160; For it is Jesus who has put out, by the grace of baptism, that fire which the priest kindled for sins; for, from the time when He appeared, the chrism has ceased, by which the priesthood or the prophetic or the kingly office was conferred.&#8221;</p>
