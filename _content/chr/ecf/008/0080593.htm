<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.iv-p2"></A>&#8220;But I myself also, O Clement, know the griefs and anxieties, and dangers and reproaches, that are appointed you from the uninstructed multitudes; and these you will be able to bear nobly, looking to the great reward of patience bestowed on you by God.&#160; But also consider this fairly with me:&#160; When has Christ need of your aid?&#160; Now, when the wicked one has sworn war against His bride; or in the time to come, when He shall reign victorious, having no need of further help?&#160; Is it not evident to any one who has even the least understanding, that it is now?&#160; Therefore with all good-will hasten in the time of the present necessity to do battle on the side of this good King, whose character it is to give great rewards after victory.&#160; Therefore take the oversight gladly; and all the more in good time, because you have learned from me the administration of the Church, for the safety of the brethren who have taken refuge with us.</p>
