<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.v-p2"></A>When Simon had made these statements, Peter said to him:&#160; &#8220;Can you call to witness that these are your beliefs that being Himself,&#8212;I do not mean Him whom you speak of now as being unrevealed, but Him in whom you believe, though you do not confess Him?&#160; For you are talking nonsense when you define one thing in stead of another.&#160; Wherefore, if you call Him to witness that you believe what you say, I shall answer you.&#160; But if you continue discussing with me what you do not believe, you compel me to strike the empty air.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;It is from some of your own disciples that I have heard <i>that this is the truth</i>.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1376"></A><A HREF="#fn_1376"><FONT SIZE="1">1377</FONT></A>
&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Do not bear false witness?&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Do not rebuke me, most insolent man.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;So long as you do not tell who it was who said so, <i>I affirm that</i> you are a liar.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Suppose that I myself have got up these doctrines, or that I heard them from some other, give me your answer to them.&#160; For if they cannot be overturned, then I have learned that this is the truth.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;If it is a human invention, I will not reply to <A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xxi.v-Page_326"></A>it; but if you are held fast by the supposition that it is the truth, acknowledge to me that this is the case, and I can then myself say something in regard to the matter.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Once for all, then, these doctrines seem to me to be true.&#160; Give me your reply, if you have aught to say against them.&#8221;</p>
