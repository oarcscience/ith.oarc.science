<span id="vi.iv.xxi.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—God Both Good and
Just.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.iii-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “I said once for
all, ‘Every lawgiver, looking to justice, is just.’”  And Peter said: 
“If it is the part of him who is good not to lay down a law, but of him
who is just to lay down a law, in this way the Framer of the world is
both good and just.  He is good, inasmuch as it is plain that He did not
lay down a law in writing from the times of Adam to Moses; but inasmuch
as He had a written law from Moses to the present times, <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[1373](#fn_1372) He is just also.”  And Simon said: 
“Prove to me from the utterances of your teacher that it is within the
power of the same man to be good and just; for to me it seems impossible
that the lawgiver who is good should also be just.”  And Peter said:  “I
shall explain to you how goodness itself is just.  Our teacher Himself
first said to the Pharisee who asked Him, <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373) ‘What shall I do to inherit eternal
life?’  ‘Do not call me good; for one is good, even the Father who is in
the heavens;’ and straightway He introduced these words, ‘But if thou
shalt wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.’  And when he
said, ‘What commandments?’ He pointed him to those of the law.  Now He
would not, if He were indicating some other good being, have referred
him to the commandments of the Just One.  That indeed justice and
goodness are different I allow, but you do not know that it is within
the power of the same being to be good and just.  For He is good, in
that He is now long-suffering with the penitent, and welcomes them; but
just, when acting as judge He will give to every one according to his
deserts.”

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.iii-p3"></span> The text seems corrupt here. 
Literally it is, “from Moses to the present times, as has been written,
He is just also.”
