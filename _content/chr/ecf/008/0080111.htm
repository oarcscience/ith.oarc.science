<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xlix-p2"></A>&#8220;His coming, therefore, was predicted by Moses, who delivered the law of God to men; but by another also before him, as I have already informed you.&#160; He therefore intimated that He should come, humble indeed in His first coming, but glorious in His second.&#160; And the first, indeed, has been already accomplished; since He has come and taught, and He, the Judge of all, has been judged and slain.&#160; But at His second coming He shall come to judge, and shall indeed condemn the wicked, but shall take the pious into a share and association with Himself in His kingdom.&#160; Now the faith of His second coming depends upon His first.&#160; For the prophets&#8212;especially Jacob and Moses&#8212;spoke of the first, but some also of the second.&#160; But the excellency of prophecy is chiefly shown in this, that the prophets spoke not of things to come, according to the sequence of things; otherwise they might seem merely as wise men to have conjectured what the sequence of things pointed out.&#8221;</p>
