id="vi.iii.vii.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Folly of Idolatry.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xv-p2"></span>“But I should like if those who
worship idols would tell me if they wish to become like those whom they
worship?  Does any one of you wish to see in such sort as they see? or
to hear after the manner of their hearing? or to have such understanding
as they have?  Far be this from any of my hearers!  For this were rather
to be thought a curse and a reproach to a man, who bears in himself the
image of God, although he has lost the likeness.  What sort of gods,
then, are they to be reckoned, the imitation of whom would be execrable
to their worshippers, and to have whose likeness would be a reproach? 
What then?  Melt your useless images, and make useful vessels.  Melt the
unserviceable and inactive metal, and make implements fit for the use of
men.  But, says one, human laws do not allow us. <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761)   He says well; for it is human laws,
and not their own power, that prevents it.  What kind of gods, then, are
those which are defended by human laws, and not by their own energies? 
And so also they are preserved from thieves by watch-dogs and the
protection of bolts, at least if they be of silver, or gold, or even of
brass; for those that are of stone and earthenware are protected by
their own worthlessness, for no one will steal a stone or a crockery
god.  Hence those seem to be the more miserable whose more precious
metal exposes them to the greater danger.  Since, then, they can be
stolen, since they must be guarded by men, since they can be melted, and
weighed out, and forged with hammers, ought men possessed of
understanding to hold them as gods?
