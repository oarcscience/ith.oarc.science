<span id="viii.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="viii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Notes by the American Editor.</span>

<span id="viii.iii.iii-p2"></span>1.  The translator’s reference to
Canon 73 is a mistake, and quite misleading.  See vol. vii. Canon 74, p.
504.

<span id="viii.iii.iii-p3"></span>2.  It is worth while to recall who
and what Zephyrinus was.  See vol. v. p. 156, Elucidation V.; also same
volume of this series, p. 157, Elucidation VI.  This unhappy prelate was
a heretic; and his decrees and opinions are worthless, as Hippolytus
shows.  Hence this letter, even were it genuine, would be of no value
whatever.  Consult also vol. v. p. 156, in Elucidation IV.; also same
volume, Elucidation III.

<span id="viii.iii.iii-p4"></span>3.  On p. 610, [Ep.
2](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#000)<span id="viii.iii.iii-p4.1"></span>,
sec. 1, observe the reference to the “statutes of Emperors,” where the
wily forger forgot himself, as if the Cæsars of this date had legislated
for the Christian Church.  On the spirit of the ancient Canons, refuting
all these Decretals, compare the Canons of Nicæa, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 15; of
Constantinople, 2 and 3; of Ephesus, 8; and of Chalcedon, 9 and 28.  To
these Canons, against the claims of the Paparchy, the Church of England
appealed at her Restoration.
