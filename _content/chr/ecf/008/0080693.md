<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Purgatory and Hell.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.vi-p2"></span>“Such is the nature of the one and only
God, who made the world, and who created us, and who has given us all
things, that as long as any one is within the limit of piety, and does
not <span id="page_240">p. 240</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi.vi-Page_240"></span>blaspheme His Holy Spirit, through His
love towards him He brings the soul to Himself by reason of His love
towards it.  And although it be sinful, it is His nature to save it,
after it has been suitably punished for the deeds it hath done.  But if
any one shall deny Him, or in any other way be guilty of impiety against
Him, and then shall repent, he shall be punished indeed for the sins he
hath committed against Him, but he shall be saved, because he turned and
lived.  And perhaps excessive piety and supplication shall even be
delivered from punishment, ignorance being admitted as a reason for the
pardon of sin after repentance. <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955)
  But those who do not repent shall be destroyed by the punishment of
fire, even though in all other things they are most holy.  But, as I
said, at an appointed time a fifth <span
id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956) part, being punished with eternal
fire, shall be consumed.  For they cannot endure for ever who have been
impious against the one God.
