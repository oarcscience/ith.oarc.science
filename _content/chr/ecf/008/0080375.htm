<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.viii-p2"></A>Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;Is there then no one of your family surviving?&#8221;&#160; I answered:&#160; &#8220;There are indeed many powerful men, coming of the stock of C&aelig;sar; for C&aelig;sar himself gave a wife to my father, as being his relative, and educated along with him, and of a suitably noble family.&#160; By her my father had twin sons, born before me, not very like one another, as my father told me; for I never knew them.&#160; But indeed I have not a distinct recollection even of my mother; but I cherish the remembrance of her face, as if I had seen it in a dream.&#160; My mother&#146;s name was Matthidia, my father&#146;s Faustinianus:&#160; my brothers&#146;, Faustinus and Faustus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_791"></A><A HREF="#fn_791"><FONT SIZE="1">792</FONT></A>
&#160; Now, when I was barely five years old, my mother saw a vision&#8212;so I learned from my father&#8212;by which she was warned that, unless she speedily left the city with her twin sons, and was absent for ten years, she and her children should perish by a miserable fate.</p>
