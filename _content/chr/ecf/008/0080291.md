id="vi.iii.vi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—How Demons Get Power Over
Men.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xv-p2"></span>“Therefore demons, as we have just
said, when once they have been able, by means of opportunities afforded
them, to convey themselves through base and evil actions into the bodies
of men, if they remain in them a long time through their own negligence,
because they do not seek after what is profitable to their souls, they
necessarily compel them for the future to fulfil the desires of the
demons who dwell in them.  But what is worst of all, at the end of the
world, when that demon shall be consigned to eternal fire, of necessity
the soul also which obeyed him, shall with him be tortured in eternal
fires, together with its body which it hath polluted.
