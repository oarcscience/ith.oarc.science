id="vi.iii.vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Egyptian Idolatry More
Reasonable Than Others.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxi-p2"></span>When Peter was speaking thus, all we
who heard him laughed.  Then said Peter:  “You laugh at the absurdities
of others, because through long custom you do not see your own.  For
indeed it is not without reason that you laugh at the folly of the
Egyptians, who worship dumb animals, while they themselves are
rational.  But I will tell you how they also laugh at you; for they say,
We worship living animals, though mortal; but you worship and adore
things which never were alive at all.  They add this also, that they are
figures and allegories of certain powers by whose help the race of men
is governed.  Taking refuge in this for shame, they fabricate these and
similar excuses, and so endeavour to screen their error.  But this is
not the time to answer the Egyptians, and leaving the care of those who
are present to heal the disease of the absent.  For it is a certain
indication that you are held to be free from sickness of this sort,
since you do not grieve over it as your own, but laugh at it as that of
others.
