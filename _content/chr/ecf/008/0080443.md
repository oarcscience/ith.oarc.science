Words, Which Ye Have Heard of Me.”</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xxxvii-p2"></span>But on the following day Peter
arose early and called us, and we went together to the secret place in
which we had been on the previous day, for the purpose of prayer.  And
when, after prayer, we were coming thence to the appointed place, he
exhorted us by the way, saying: <span id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818)
  “Hear me, most beloved fellow-servants:  It is good that every one of
you, according to his ability, contribute to the advantage of those who
are approaching to the faith of our religion; and therefore do not
shrink from instructing the ignorant, and teaching according to the
wisdom which has been bestowed upon you by the providence of God, yet so
that you only join the eloquence of your discourse with those things
which you have heard from me, and which have been committed to you.  But
do not speak anything which is your own, and which has not been
committed to you, though it may seem to yourselves to be true; but hold
forth those things, as I have said, which I myself have received from
the true Prophet, and have delivered to you, although they may seem to
be less full of authority.  For thus it often happens that men turn away
from the truth, while they believe that they have found out, by their
own thoughts, a form of truth more true and powerful.”
