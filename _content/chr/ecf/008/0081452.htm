<p class="c21"><a name="ix.v.ii-p4"></A>Ye know that I said unto you, that none of the souls which go forth out of the bodies of men are under <i>the power of</i> death, but that they all live and continue to exist, and that there are for them mansions and an abode of rest.&#160; For the reasoning <i>power</i> of the soul does not cease, nor the knowledge, because it is the image of the immortal God.&#160; For it is not without perceptions, after the manner of the bodily frame, which has no perception of that corruption which has acquired dominion over it.&#160; Recompense, however, and reward it will not receive apart from its bodily form, because what it experiences belongs not to itself alone, but to the bodily form also in which it dwelt for a time.&#160; But the disobedient, who have not known God, will then repent without avail.</p>
