<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.lx-p2"></A>Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;You represent him as weak enough.&#160; For if, as you say, he is more powerful than all, it can never be believed the weaker wrenched the spoils from the stronger.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_666"></A><A HREF="#fn_666"><FONT SIZE="1">667</FONT></A>
&#160; Or if God the Creator was able by violence to bring down souls into this world, how can it be that, when they are separated from the body and freed from the bonds of captivity, the good God shall call them to the sufferance of punishment, on the ground that they, either through his remissness or weakness, were dragged away to this place, and were involved in the body, as in the darkness of ignorance?&#160; You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is:&#160; but I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you, who are in such error in respect of the knowledge of God.&#8221;&#160; Then said Simon:&#160; &#8220;A time will come when you shall be sorry that you did not understand me speaking of the ineffable power.&#8221;&#160; Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;Give us then, as I have often said, as being yourself a new God, or as having yourself come down from him, some new sense, by means of which we may know that new God of whom you speak; for those five senses, which God our Creator has given us, keep faith to their own Creator, and do not perceive that there is any other God, for so their nature necessitates them.&#8221;</p>
