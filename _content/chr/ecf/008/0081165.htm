<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxiii.xx-p2"></A>When Peter suggested this, my father said:&#160; &#8220;I know what you want; wherefore take no trouble.&#160; For assuredly I shall take good care, when I reach that place, to make such statements in regard to you as I ought to make.&#8221;&#160; And Peter again suggested:&#160; &#8220;When, then, you perceive the city changing from its hatred of me, and longing to see me, send information to me of this, and I shall come to you immediately.&#160; And when I arrive there, that same day I shall remove the strange shape which now invests you, and I shall make your own unmistakeably visible to your own people and to all others.&#8221;&#160; Saying this, he made his sons, my brothers, and our mother Mattidia to go along with him; and he also commanded some of his more intimate acquaintances to accompany him.&#160; But my mother was&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1537"></A><A HREF="#fn_1537"><FONT SIZE="1">1538</FONT></A>

 it is impossible for me to recline on the same couch with him!&#160; But I do not know if I shall be persuaded to go along with him.&#8221;&#160; And while she was very unwilling to go, Annubion urged her, saying:&#160; &#8220;Believe me and Peter, and the very voice itself, that this is <i>Faustus</i> your husband, whom I love not less than you.&#160; And I myself <i>will go</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1539"></A><A HREF="#fn_1539"><FONT SIZE="1">1540</FONT></A>
