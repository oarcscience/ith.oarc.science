<p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.viii-p2"></A>And a few days thereafter, a boy in that town was splitting wood, and struck his foot.&#160; And a great crowd went to him, and Jesus too went with them.&#160; And He touched the foot which had been hurt, and immediately it was made whole.&#160; And Jesus said to him:&#160; Rise, and split the wood, and remember me.&#160; And when the crowd saw the miracles that were done by Him, they adored Jesus, and said:&#160; Indeed we most surely believe that Thou art God.</p>
