<p class="c35"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXVIII.&#8212;Jewish Customs.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p2"></A>&#8220;I shall add another thing which may satisfy even the most incredulous.&#160; All the Jews who live under the law of Moses circumcise their sons on the eighth day without fail, and shed the blood of the tender infant.&#160; But no one of the Gentiles has ever submitted to this on the eighth day; and, on the other hand, no one of the Jews has ever omitted it.&#160; How then shall the account of <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p2.1"></A>Genesis</span> stand with this, since Jews live in all parts of the world, mixed with Gentiles, and on the eighth day suffer the cutting of a member?&#160; And no one of the Gentiles, but only they themselves, as I have said, do this, induced to it not by the compulsion of any star, nor by the perfusion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_847"></A><A HREF="#fn_847"><FONT SIZE="1">848</FONT></A>
 of blood, but by the law of their religion; and in whatever part of the world they are, this sign is familiar to them.&#160; But also the fact that one name is among them all, wheresoever they are, does this also come through <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p3.1"></A>Genesis</span>?&#160; And also that no child born among them is ever exposed, and that on every seventh day they all rest, wherever they may be, and do not go upon a journey, and do not use fire?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_848"></A><A HREF="#fn_848"><FONT SIZE="1">849</FONT></A>
&#160; Why is it, then, that no one of the Jews is compelled by <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p4.2"></A>Genesis</span> to go on a journey, or to build, or to sell or buy anything on that day?</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxviii-p3"></A> Probably we should read <i>perfusionem</i> instead of <i>perfusione</i>, and then the translation would be:&#160; &#8220;no star compelling, or even urging on them the shedding of blood.&#8221;&#160; So Whiston translates.</p>
