<span id="vii.v.viii-p2"></span>Then Abiathar the priest offered gifts
without end to the high priests, in order that he might obtain her as
wife to his son.  But Mary forbade them, saying:  It cannot be that I
should know a man, or that a man should know me.  For all the priests
and all her relations kept saying to her:  God is worshipped in children
and adored in posterity, as has always happened among the sons of
Israel.  But Mary answered and said unto them:  God is worshipped in
chastity, as is proved first of all. <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[1631](#fn_1630)   For before Abel there was none
righteous among men, and he by his offerings pleased God, and was
without mercy slain by him who displeased Him.  Two crowns, therefore,
he received—of oblation and of virginity, because in his flesh there was
no pollution.  Elias also, when he was in the flesh, was taken up in the
flesh, because he kept his flesh unspotted.  Now I, from my infancy in
the temple of God, have learned that virginity can be sufficiently dear
to God.  And so, because I can offer what is dear to God, I have
resolved in my heart that I should not know a man at all.
