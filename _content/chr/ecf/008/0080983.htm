<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.xii-p2"></A>When Peter had spoken thus, a certain one amongst us ventured to invite him, in the name of all, that next day, early in the morning, he should sail to Aradus, an island opposite, distant, I suppose, not quite thirty stadia, for the purpose of seeing two pillars of vine-wood that were there, and that were of very great girth.&#160; Therefore the indulgent Peter consented, saying, &#8220;When you leave the boat, do not go many of you together to see the things that you desire to see; for I do not wish that the attention of the inhabitants should be turned to you.&#8221;&#160; And so we sailed, and in short time arrived at the island.&#160; Then landing from the boat, we went to the place where the vine-wood pillars were, and along with them we looked at several of the works of Phidias.</p>
