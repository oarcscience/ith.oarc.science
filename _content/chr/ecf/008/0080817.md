Promised.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.viii.xxx-p2"></span>The others having heard these things
from me, and desiring to learn what would ensue, accompanied me to visit
Appion.  And we found him bathed, and sitting at a table furnished. 
Wherefore we inquired but little into the matter concerning the gods. 
But he, understanding, I suppose, our wish, promised that next day he
would have something to say about the gods, and appointed to us the same
place where he would converse with us.  And we, as soon as he had
promised, thanked him, and departed, each one to his home.
