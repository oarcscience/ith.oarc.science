<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.vii-p2"></A>&#8220;And with respect to the presbyters, take these <i>instructions</i>.&#160; Above all things, let them join the young betimes in marriage, anticipating the entanglements of youthful lusts.&#160; But neither let them neglect the marriage of those who are already old; for lust is vigorous even in some old men.&#160; Lest, therefore, fornication find a place among you, and bring upon you a very pestilence, take precaution, and search, lest at any time the fire of adultery be secretly kindled among you.&#160; For adultery is a very terrible thing, even such that it holds the second place in respect of punishment, the first being assigned to those who are in error, even although they be chaste.&#160; Wherefore do you, as elders of the Church, exercise the spouse of Christ to chastity (by the spouse I mean the body of the Church); for if she be apprehended to be chaste by her royal Bridegroom, she shall obtain the greatest honour; and you, as wedding guests, shall receive great commendation.&#160; But if she be caught having sinned, she herself indeed shall be cast out; and you shall suffer punishment, if at any time her sin has been through your negligence.</p>
