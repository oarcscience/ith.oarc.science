<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xxvi-p2"></A>To this Peter answered:&#160; &#8220;I am exceedingly delighted, O Clement, that I commit my words to so safe a heart; for to be mindful of the things that are spoken is an indication of having in readiness the faith of works.&#160; But he from whom the wicked demon steals away the words of salvation, and snatches them away from his memory, cannot be saved, even though he wish it; for he loses the way by which life is reached.&#160; Wherefore let us the rather repeat what has been spoken, and confirm it in your heart, that is, in what manner or by whom the world was made, that we may proceed to the friendship of the Creator.&#160; But His friendship is secured by living well, and by obeying His will; which will is the law of all that live.&#160; We shall therefore unfold these things briefly to you, in order that they may be the more surely remembered.</p>
