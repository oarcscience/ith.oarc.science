<span id="vi.iv.xv.xx-p2"></span>Then Peter, not knowing that she had
spoken falsely, through pity towards her, began to tell her the truth: 
“There is a certain young man in attendance upon me, thirsting after the
discourses on religion, a Roman citizen, who told me how that, having a
father and two twin brothers, he has lost sight of them all.  For,” says
he, “my mother, as my father related to me, having seen a vision, left
the city Rome for a time with her twin children, lest she should perish
by an evil fate, and having gone away with them, she cannot be found;
and her husband, the young man’s father, having gone in search of her,
he also cannot be found.”
