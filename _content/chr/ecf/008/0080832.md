<span id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Peleus and Thetis,
Prometheus, Achilles, and Polyxena.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p2"></span>“And the marriage banquet, at which
Zeus held the feast on the occasion of the marriage of the Nereid Thetis
and the beautiful Peleus, has in it this allegory, <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1072](#fn_1071) —that you may know, Appion, that
you are not the only one from whom I have heard this sort of thing.  The
banquet, then, is the world, and the twelve are these heavenly props of
the Fates, <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072) called the
Zodiac.  Prometheus is foresight (<span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p4.1"></span>prometheia</span>), by which all things
arose; Peleus is clay (<span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p4.2"></span>pelos</span>), namely, that which was
<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p4.3"></span>collected <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073) </span> from the earth and mixed
with Nereis, or water, to produce man; and from the mixing of the two,
i.e., water and earth, the first offspring was not begotten, but
fashioned complete, and called Achilles, because he never put his lips
(<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p5.2"></span>cheile</span>) to
the breast. <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074)   Still in the
bloom of life, he is slain by an arrow while desiring to have Polyxena,
that is, something other than the truth, and foreign (<span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p6.1"></span>xene</span>) to it, death
stealing on him through a wound in his foot.

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p3"></span> \[Comp. chap. 2, and *Recognitions*,
40, 41.—R.\]

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[265:1073](0080832.htm#fr_1072) <span
id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p4"></span> The Latin takes “moira” in the sense
of “district,” and translates, “these props of the districts of the
sky.”

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[265:1074](0080832.htm#fr_1073) <span
id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p4.4"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p5"></span> This is Wieseler’s conjecture for
reading of the <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p5.1"></span>mss.</span>, “contrived.”

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[265:1075](0080832.htm#fr_1074) <span
id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p5.3"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xiv-p6"></span> This is Schwegler’s restoration of
the passage.  Davisius proposes, “He is in the bloom of life, at which
time if any one desires,” etc.
