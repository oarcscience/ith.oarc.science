id="vi.iii.iii.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIV.—Temple to Be
Destroyed.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxiv-p2"></span>“‘For we,’ said I, ‘have
ascertained beyond doubt that God is much rather displeased with the
sacrifices which you offer, the time of sacrifices having now passed
away; and because ye will not acknowledge that the time for offering
victims is now past, therefore the temple shall be destroyed, and the
abomination of desolation <span id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591) shall
stand in the holy place; and then the Gospel shall be preached to the
Gentiles for a testimony against you, that your unbelief may be judged
by their faith.  For the whole world at different times suffers under
divers maladies, either spreading generally over all, or affecting
specially.  Therefore it needs a physician to visit it for its
salvation.  We therefore bear witness to you, and declare to you what
has been hidden from every one of you.  It is for you to consider what
is for your advantage.’”
