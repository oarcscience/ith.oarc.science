<span id="vi.iv.vi.viii-p2"></span>“Therefore the love of men towards
God is sufficient for salvation.  And this the wicked one knows; and
while we are hastening to sow the love towards Him which makes immortal
in the souls of those who from among the Gentiles are ready to believe
in the one and only God, this wicked one, having sufficient armour
against the ignorant for their destruction, hastens to sow the
supposition of many gods, or at least of one greater, in order that men,
conceiving and being persuaded of what is not wisdom, may die, as in the
crime of adultery, and be cast out from His kingdom.
