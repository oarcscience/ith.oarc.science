id="vi.iv.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.—Electioneering
Stratagems.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.v.xxiv-p2"></span>“He being absent in Egypt for the
practice of magic, and John being killed, Dositheus desiring the
leadership, <span id="fr_936"></span>[937](#fn_936) falsely gave out
that Simon was dead, and succeeded to the seat.  But Simon, returning
not long after, and strenuously holding by the place as his own, when he
met with Dositheus did not demand the place, knowing that a man who has
attained power beyond his expectations cannot be removed from it. 
Wherefore with pretended friendship he gives himself for a while to the
second place, under Dositheus.  But taking his place after a few days
among the thirty fellow-disciples, he began to malign Dositheus as not
delivering the instructions correctly.  And this he said that he did,
not through unwillingness to deliver them correctly, but through
ignorance.  And on one occasion, Dositheus, perceiving that this artful
accusation of Simon was dissipating the opinion of him with respect to
many, so that they did not think that he was the Standing One, came in a
rage to the usual place of meeting, and finding Simon, struck him with a
staff.  But it seemed to pass through the body of Simon as if he had
been smoke.  Thereupon Dositheus, being confounded, said to him, ‘If you
are the Standing One, I also will worship you.’  Then Simon said that he
was; and Dositheus, knowing that he himself was not the Standing One,
fell down and worshipped; and associating himself with the twenty-nine
chiefs, he raised Simon to his own place of repute; and thus, not many
days after, Dositheus himself, while he (Simon) stood, fell down and
died.
