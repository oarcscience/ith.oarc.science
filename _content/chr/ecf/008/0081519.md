<span id="x.vi.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="x.vi.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Concerning the Martyrdom of Symeon the son
of Clopas, Bishop of Jerusalem. <span
id="fr_3700"></span>[3701](#fn_3700) </span>

<span id="x.vi.ii.iii-p3"></span>Some of these heretics, forsooth, laid
an information against Symeon the son of Clopas, as being of *the family
of* David, and a Christian.  And on these charges he suffered martyrdom
when he was 120 years old, in the reign of Trajan Cæsar, when Atticus
was consular legate <span id="fr_3701"></span>[3702](#fn_3701) *in
Syria*.  And it so happened, says the same writer, that, while inquiry
was then being made for those belonging to the royal tribe of the Jews,
the accusers themselves were convicted of belonging to it.  With show of
reason could it be said that Symeon was one of those who actually saw
and heard the Lord, on the ground of his great age, and also because the
Scripture of the Gospels makes mention of Mary the *daughter* of Clopas,
who, as our narrative has shown already, was his father.

<span id="x.vi.ii.iii-p5"></span>*The same historian mentions* others
also, of the family of one of the reputed brothers of the Saviour, named
Judas, as having survived until this same reign, after the testimony
they bore for the faith of Christ in the time of Domitian, as already
recorded.

<span id="x.vi.ii.iii-p6"></span>*He writes as follows:*  They came,
then, and took the presidency of every church, as witnesses *for
Christ*, and as being of the kindred of the Lord.  And, after profound
peace had been established in every church, they remained down to the
reign of Trajan Cæsar:  *that is*, until the time when he who was sprung
from an uncle of the Lord, the aforementioned Symeon son of Clopas, was
informed against by the *various* heresies, and subjected to an
accusation like the rest, and for the same cause, before the legate
Atticus; and, while suffering outrage during many days, he bore
testimony *for Christ:*  so that all, including the legate himself, were
astonished above measure that a man 120 years old should have been able
to endure *such torments*.  He was finally condemned to be crucified.

<span id="x.vi.ii.iii-p7"></span>…Up to that period the Church had
remained like a virgin pure and uncorrupted:  for, if there were any
persons who were disposed to tamper with the wholesome rule of the
preaching of salvation, <span id="fr_3702"></span>[3703](#fn_3702) they
still lurked in some dark place of concealment or other.  But, when the
sacred band of apostles had in various ways closed their lives, and that
generation of men to whom it had been vouchsafed to listen to the
Godlike Wisdom with their own ears had passed away, then did the
confederacy of godless error take its rise through the treachery of
false teachers, who, seeing that none of the apostles any longer
survived, at length attempted with bare *and uplifted* head to oppose
the preaching of the truth by preaching “knowledge falsely so called.”
