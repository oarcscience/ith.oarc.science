<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxix-p2"></span>While Peter was about to explain
fully to us this mystic word, Zacchæus came, saying:  “Now indeed, O
Peter, is the time for you to go out and engage in the discussion; for a
great crowd awaits you, packed together in the court; and in the midst
of them stands Simon, like a war-chieftain attended by his spearmen.” 
And Peter, hearing this, ordered me to withdraw for prayer, as not yet
having received baptism for salvation, and then said to those who were
already perfected:  “Let us rise and pray that God, by His unfailing
mercies, may help me striving for the salvation of the men whom He has
made.”  And having thus said, and having prayed, he went out into the
uncovered portion of the court, which was a large space; and there <span

purpose of seeing him, his pre-eminence having made them more eagerly
hasten to hear. <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971)
