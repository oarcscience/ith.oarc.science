id="vi.iv.ix.xix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—None of These Allegories are
Consistent.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xix-p2"></span>“Nor do we find the poetical allegory
about any of the gods consistent with itself.  To go no further than the
fashioning of the universe, the poets now say that nature was the first
cause of the whole creation, now that it was mind.  For, say they, the
first moving and mixture of the elements came from nature, but it was
the foresight of mind which arranged them in order.  Even when they
assert that it was nature which fashioned the universe, being unable
absolutely to demonstrate this on account of the traces of design in the
work, they in weave the foresight of mind in such a way that they are
able to entrap even the wisest.  But we say to them:  If the world arose
from self-moved nature, how did it ever take proportion and shape, which
cannot come but from a superintending wisdom, and can be comprehended
only by knowledge, which alone can trace such things?  If, on the other
hand, it is by wisdom that all things subsist and maintain order, how
can it be that those things arose from self-moved chance?
