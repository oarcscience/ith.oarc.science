<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.vi-p2"></A>Then Anna, filled with the Holy Spirit, said before them all:&#160; The Lord Almighty, the God of Hosts, being mindful of His word, hath visited His people with a good and holy visitation, to bring down the hearts of the Gentiles who were rising against us, and turn them to Himself.&#160; He hath opened His ears to our prayers:&#160; He hath kept away from us the exulting of all our enemies.&#160; The barren hath become a mother, and hath brought forth exultation and gladness to Israel.&#160; Behold the gifts which I have brought to offer to my Lord, and mine enemies have not been able to hinder me.&#160; For God hath turned their hearts to me, and Himself hath given me everlasting joy.</p>
