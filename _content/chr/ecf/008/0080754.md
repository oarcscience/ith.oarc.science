Office-Bearers.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.lxvii-p2"></span>“It is necessary, therefore, that
the Church, as a city built upon a hill, have an order approved of God,
and good government.  In particular, let the bishop, as chief, be heard
in the things which he speaks; and let the elders give heed that the
things ordered be done.  Let the deacons, going about, look after the
bodies and the souls of the brethren, and report to the bishop.  Let all
the rest of the brethren bear wrong patiently; but if they wish judgment
to be given concerning wrongs done to them, let them be reconciled in
presence of the elders; and let the elders report the reconciliation to
the bishop.
