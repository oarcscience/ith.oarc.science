<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lvii-p2"></A>When he had given them these and such like precepts, he made proclamation to the people, saying:&#160; &#8220;Since I have resolved to stay three months with you, if any one desires it, let him be baptized; that, stripped of his former evils, he may for the future, in consequence of his own conduct, become heir of heavenly blessings, as a reward for his good actions.&#160; Whosoever will, then, let him come to Zacch&aelig;us and give his name to him, and let him hear from him the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.&#160; Let him attend to frequent fastings, and approve himself in all things, that at the end of these three months he may be baptized on the day of the festival.&#160; But every one of you shall be baptized in ever flowing waters, the name of the Trine Beatitude being invoked over him; he being first anointed with oil sanctified by prayer, that so at length, being consecrated by these things, he may attain a perception of holy things.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_712"></A><A HREF="#fn_712"><FONT SIZE="1">713</FONT></A>
