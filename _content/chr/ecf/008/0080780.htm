<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.xix-p2"></A>&#8220;Wherefore it behoves the young not to be satisfied with those corrupting lessons, and those who are in their prime should carefully avoid listening to the mythologies of the Greeks.&#160; For lessons about their gods are much worse than ignorance, as we have shown from the case of those dwelling in the country, who sin less through their not having been instructed by Greeks.&#160; Truly, such fables of theirs, and spectacles, and books, ought to be shunned, and if it were possible, even their cities.&#160; For those who are full of evil learning, even with their breath infect as with madness those who associate with them, with their own passions.&#160; And what is worst, whoever is most instructed among them, is so much the more turned from the judgment which is according to nature.</p>
