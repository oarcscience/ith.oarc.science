 as having here received his good things, may there be punished for his sins; and the good man, who has been punished here for his sins, may then, as in the bosom of the righteous, be constituted an heir of good things.&#160; Since therefore God is righteous, it is fully evident to us that there is a judgment, and that souls are immortal.</p>
