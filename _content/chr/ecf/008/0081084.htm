<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xx.x-p2"></A>&#8220;This is the mystery of the hebdomad.&#160; For He Himself is the rest of the whole who grants <A NAME="page_321"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 321</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xx.x-Page_321"></A>Himself as a rest to those who imitate His greatness within their little measure.&#160; For He is alone, sometimes comprehensible, sometimes incomprehensible, <i>sometimes limitable</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1340"></A><A HREF="#fn_1340"><FONT SIZE="1">1341</FONT></A>
 sometimes illimitable, having extensions which proceed from Him into infinity.&#160; For thus He is comprehensible and incomprehensible, near and far, being here and there, as being the only existent one, and as giving a share of that mind which is infinite on every hand, in consequence of which souls breathe and possess life;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1341"></A><A HREF="#fn_1341"><FONT SIZE="1">1342</FONT></A>

 to it.&#160; What affection ought therefore to arise within us if we gaze with our mind on His beautiful shape!&#160; But otherwise it is absurd <i>to speak of beauty</i>.&#160; For beauty cannot exist apart from shape; nor can one be attracted to the love of God, nor even deem that he can see Him, if God has no form.</p>
