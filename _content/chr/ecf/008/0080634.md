<span id="vi.iv.v.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.v.i-p3.1"></span>Therefore</span> the next day, I Clement,
awaking from sleep before dawn, and learning that Peter was astir, and
was conversing with his attendants concerning the worship of God (there
were sixteen of them, <span id="fr_916"></span>[917](#fn_916) and I have
thought good to set forth their names, as I subsequently learned them,
that you may also know who they were.  The first of them was Zacchæus,
who was once a publican, and Sophonias his brother; Joseph and his
foster-brother Michaias; also Thomas and Eliezer the twins; also Æneas
and Lazarus the priests; besides also Elisæus, and Benjamin the son of
Saphrus; as also Rubilus and Zacharias the builders; and Ananias and
Haggæus the Jamminians; and Nicetas and Aquila the friends),—accordingly
I went in and saluted him, and at his request sat down.

is attached to the number twelve.  Comp. also *Recognitions*, ii. 1.  A
comparison of these lists favors the theory of a common documentary
basis.—R.\]
