Appeared in Different Ages.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xx-p2"></span>“But give heed to my first discourse of
the truth.  If any one do not allow the man fashioned by the hands of
God to have had the Holy Spirit of Christ, how is he not guilty of the
greatest impiety in allowing another born of an impure stock to have
it?  But he would act most piously, if he should not allow to another to
have it, but should say that he alone has it, who has changed his forms
and his names from the beginning of the world, and so reappeared again
and again in the world, until coming upon his own times, and being
anointed with mercy for the works of God, he shall enjoy rest for ever. 
His honour it is to bear rule and lordship over all things, in air,
earth, and waters.  But in addition to these, himself having made man,
he had breath, the indescribable garment of the soul, that he might be
able to be immortal.
