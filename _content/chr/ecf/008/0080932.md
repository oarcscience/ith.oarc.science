id="vi.iv.xiii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV.—Servants Become
Masters.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xxv-p2"></span>“But if they were able to do
something, you should not be right in calling them gods:  for it is not
right to call the elements gods, by which good things are supplied; but
only Him who ordereth them, to accomplish all things for our use, and
who commandeth them to be serviceable to man,—Him alone we call God in
propriety of speech, whose beneficence you do not perceive, but permit
those elements to rule over you which have been assigned to you as your
servants.  And why should I speak of the elements, when you not only
have made and do worship lifeless images, but deign to be subject to
them in all respects as servants?  Wherefore, by reason of your
erroneous judgments, you have become subject to demons.  However, by
acknowledgment of God Himself, by good deeds you can again become
masters, and command the demons as slaves, and as sons of God be
constituted heirs of the eternal kingdom.”
