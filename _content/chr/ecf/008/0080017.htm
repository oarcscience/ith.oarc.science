<p class="c15"><a name="iii.xv-p1"></A> <span class="c29"><a name="iii.xv-p1.1"></A>Note by the American Editor.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="iii.xv-p2"></A><span class="c9"><a name="iii.xv-p2.1"></A>I had</span> prepared annotations for these pages which I find will require more space than this overloaded volume can afford.&#160; Let me indicate some sources of information which the student may find convenient.&#160; Thus, in Liddon&#146;s <i>Bampton Lecture</i> (4th ed., London, 1869), consult p. 71 for remarks on Philo and Alexandrian Jews; see also p. 91.&#160; Concerning the &#8220;Book of Enoch,&#8221; pp. 7 and 302; see Westcott, <i>Study of the Gospels</i> (London, 1867), p. 109, a reference to the <i>Book of Jubilees</i>, and its lack of reference to Messiah.&#160; See Jewish doctrine of the Messiah, pp. 86, 143, 151; the &#8220;Book of Henoch,&#8221; pp. 69, 93, 101; apocryphal words of Jews, p. 428.&#160; He places the &#8220;Book of Henoch&#8221; earlier than the &#8220;Book of Jubilees,&#8221; and the Twelve Patriarchs after that.&#160; Compare Westcott&#146;s <i>Historic Faith</i> (London, 1883), a quotation from Goldwin Smith, on &#8220;the blood of Christ,&#8221; note 8, p. 237.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="iii.xv-p3"></A>I cannot forbear to note, among useful suggestions in these <i>Testaments</i>, that (on p. 11) of the share of Simeon in the persecution of Joseph.&#160; It explains the real purpose of Joseph in selecting Simeon as the hostage to be left in Egypt (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#021">Gen. xlii. 21-24</a><a name="iii.xv-p3.1"></A>.)&#160; Joseph heard the mutual reproaches of his brothers, and foresaw that Simeon would be made to suffer as most guilty:&#160; so he was withdrawn.&#160; Again, a like anxiety (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#002">Gen. xlv. 2</a><a name="iii.xv-p3.2"></A>) appears when Simeon was sent back with them to his father.&#160; Other suggestions may be noted as substantially illustrating the sacred narrative.</p>
