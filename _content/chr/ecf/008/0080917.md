Serpent.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.x-p2"></span>“For His alone is the excellent glory
of being alone uncreated, while all else is created.  As, therefore, it
is the prerogative of the uncreated to be God, so whatever is created is
not God indeed.  Before all things, therefore, you ought to consider the
evil-working suggestion of the deceiving serpent that is in you, which
seduces you by the promise of better reason, creeping from your brain to
your spinal marrow, and setting great value upon deceiving you. <span
