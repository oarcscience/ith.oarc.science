id="vi.iv.xix.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Peter Commences the
Discussion.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.v-p2"></span>Peter then said:  “I am ready to do as
the umpire of our discussion has said; and straight-way without any
delay I shall set forth my opinion in regard to God.  I then assert that
there is one God who made the heavens and the earth, and all things that
are in them.  And it is not right to say or to think that there is any
other.”  And Simon said:  “But I maintain that the Scriptures believed
in amongst the Jews say that there are many gods, and that God is not
angry at this, because He has Himself spoken of many gods in His
Scriptures.
