<p class="c53"><a name="viii.v.iii-p2"></A>Of the persons by whom, and the uses for which, ecclesiastical property should be managed, and of the invaders thereof.</p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="viii.v.iii-p3"></A>The property, moreover, in the possession of the several parishes was left in the hands of the bishops, who hold the place of the apostles; and it is so to this day, and ought to be so in all future time.&#160; And out of those possessions the bishops and the faithful as their stewards ought to furnish to all who wish to enter the life in common all necessaries as they best can, so that none may be found in want among them.&#160; For the possessions of the faithful are also called oblations, because they are offered to the Lord.&#160; <A NAME="page_620"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 620</FONT></A> <a name="viii.v.iii-Page_620"></A>They ought not therefore to be turned to any other uses than those of the Church, and in behoof of Christian brethren before mentioned, and of the poor; for they are the offerings of the faithful, and they are redemption moneys for sins (<i>pretia peccatorum</i>), and the patrimony of the poor, and are given over to the Lord for the purpose already named.&#160; But if any one act otherwise (which may God forbid), let him take care lest he meet the condemnation of Ananias and Sapphira, and be found guilty of sacrilege, as those were who lied as to the price of the property designated, of whom we read thus in the before-cited passage of the Acts of the Apostles:&#160; &#8220;But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold land (<i>agrum</i>), and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles&#146; feet.&#160; But Peter said to Ananias, Why hath Satan tempted (<i>tentavit</i>) thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?&#160; Whilst it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?&#160; Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?&#160; Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto the Lord.&#160; And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down, and gave up the ghost.&#160; And great fear came on all them that heard <i>these things</i>.&#160; And the young men arose, and removed him (<i>amoverunt</i>), and carried him out, and buried him.&#160; And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.&#160; And Peter answered unto her, and said, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much?&#160; And she said, Yea, for so much.&#160; Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?&#160; Behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.&#160; Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost.&#160; And the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.&#160; And great fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard these things.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2767"></A><A HREF="#fn_2767"><FONT SIZE="1">2768</FONT></A>
&#160; These things, brethren, are carefully to be guarded against, and greatly to be feared.&#160; For the property of the Church, not being like personal, but like common property, and property offered to the Lord, is to be dispensed with the deepest fear, in the spirit of faithfulness, and for no other objects than the above-named, lest those should incur the guilt of sacrilege who divert it from the hands to which it was consigned, and lest they should come under the punishment and death of Ananias and Sapphira, and lest (which is yet worse) they should become anathema maranatha, and lest, though their body may not fall dead like that of Ananias and Sapphira, their soul, which is nobler than the body, should fall dead, and be cut off from the company of the faithful, and sink into the depths of the pit.&#160; Wherefore all must give heed to this matter, and watch in faithfulness, and avert the dishonour of such usurpation, lest possessions dedicated to the uses of things secret (or sacred) and heavenly be spoiled by any parties invading them.&#160; And if any one do so, then, after the sharp vengeance which is due to such a crime, and which is justly to be carried out against the sacrilegious, let him be condemned to perpetual infamy, and cast into prison or consigned to life-long exile.&#160; For, according to the apostle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2768"></A><A HREF="#fn_2768"><FONT SIZE="1">2769</FONT></A>
 we ought to deliver such a man to Satan, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</p>
