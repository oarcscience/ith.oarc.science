<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxvi-p2"></A>&#8220;But some one skilled in the science of mathematics will say that <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxvi-p2.1"></A>Genesis</span> is divided into seven parts, which they call climates, and that over each climate one of the seven heavenly bodies bears rule; and that those diverse laws to which we have referred are not given by men, but by those dominant stars according to their will, and that that which pleases the star is observed by men as a law.&#160; To this we shall answer, in the first place, that the world is not divided into seven parts; and in the second place, that if it were so, we find many different laws in one part and one country; and therefore there are neither seven <i>laws</i> according to the number of the heavenly bodies, nor twelve according to the number of the signs, nor thirty-six according to that of the divisions of ten degrees; but they are innumerable.</p>
