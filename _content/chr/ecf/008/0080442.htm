<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xxxvi-p2"></A>And when the old man had said this, Peter said to the chief man of the city:&#160; &#8220;Since you have shown your good-will in our presence, it is not right that you should go away sorrowful; but we will accept from you favour for favour.&#160; Show us your house, and make it ready, so that the discussion which is to be to-morrow may be held there, and that any who wish to be present to hear it may be admitted.&#8221;&#160; When the chief man of the city heard this, he rejoiced greatly; and all the people also heard it gladly.&#160; And when the crowds had dispersed, he pointed out his house; and the old man also was preparing to depart.&#160; But I commanded one of my attendants to follow the old man secretly, and find out where he stayed.&#160; And when we returned to our lodging, we told our brethren all our dealings with the old man; and so, as usual, we supped and went to sleep.</p>
