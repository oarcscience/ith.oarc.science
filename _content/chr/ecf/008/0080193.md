<span id="vi.iii.iv.lvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iv.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVI.—No God Above the
Creator.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lvi-p2"></span>“What kind of conduct, then, would it
be that we should forsake God, in whose world we live and enjoy all
things necessary for life, and follow I know not whom, from whom we not
only obtain no good, but cannot even know that he exists?  Nor truly
does he exist.  For whether you call him light, and brighter than that
light which we see, you borrow that very name from the Creator of the
world; or whether you say that he is a substance above all, you derive
from Him the idea with enlargement of speech. <span
id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665)   Whether you make mention of mind, or
goodness, or life, or whatever else, you borrow the words from Him. 
Since, then, you have nothing new con<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>
<span id="vi.iii.iv.lvi-Page_113"></span>cerning that power you speak
of, not only as regards understanding, but even in respect of naming
him, how do you introduce a new God, for whom you cannot even find a new
name?  For not only is the Creator of the world called a Power, but even
the ministers of His glory, and all the heavenly host.  Do you not then
think it better that we should follow our Creator God, as a Father who
trains us and endows us as He knows how?  But if, as you say, there be
some God more benignant than all, it is certain that he will not be
angry with us; or if he be angry, he is evil.  For if our God is angry
and punishes, He is not evil, but righteous, for He corrects and amends
His own sons.  But he who has no concern with us, if he shall punish us,
how should he be good?  Inflicting punishments upon us because we have
not been drawn by vain imaginations to forsake our own Father and follow
him, how can you assert that he is so good, when he cannot be regarded
as even just?”

substance from the God of the Jews, and only enlarge it by the addition
of the words *above all*.
