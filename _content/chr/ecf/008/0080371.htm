<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.iv-p2"></A>But when they were gone, I Clement rejoiced greatly because he had kept me with himself, and I said to him:&#160; &#8220;I give thanks to God that you have not sent me forward with the others, for I should have died through sadness.&#8221;&#160; Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;And what will happen if necessity shall demand that you be sent anywhere for the purpose of teaching?&#160; Would you die if you were separated from me for a good purpose?&#160; Would you not put a restraint upon yourself, to bear patiently what necessity has laid upon you?&#160; Or do you not know that friends are always together, and are joined in memory, though they be separated bodily; as, on the other hand, some persons are near to one another in body, but are separate in mind?&#8221;</p>
