id="vi.iv.xvii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Faustus Himself
Appears.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.ix-p2"></span>When Peter said this, our mother
could no longer endure it, but cried out, “Alas! my husband! loving us,
you died by your own decision, <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[1210](#fn_1209) while we are still alive, see the
light, and have just partaken of food.”  This one scream had not yet
ceased, when, lo! the old man came in, and at the same time wishing to
inquire into the cause of the cry, he looked on the woman and said,
“What does this mean?  Whom do I see?”  And going up to her, and looking
at her, and being looked at more carefully, he embraced her.  But they
were like to die through the sudden joy, and wishing to speak to each
other, they could not get the power in consequence of their unsatisfied
joy, for they were seized with speechlessness.  But not long after, our
mother said to him:  “I now have you, Faustus, in every way the dearest
being to me.  How then are you alive, when we heard a short time ago
that you were dead?  But these are our sons, Faustinus, Faustinianus,
and Clement.”  And when she said this, we all three fell on him, and
kissed him, and in rather an indistinct way we recalled his form to our
memory. <span id="fr_1210"></span>[1211](#fn_1210)
