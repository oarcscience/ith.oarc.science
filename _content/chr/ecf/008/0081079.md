<span id="vi.iv.xx.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Jesus Inconsistent in His
Teaching.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.v-p2"></span>“‘In saying this, Jesus is consistent
not even with himself.  For sometimes by other utterances, taken from
the Scriptures, he presents God as being terrible and just,
saying, <span id="fr_1322"></span>[1323](#fn_1322) “Fear not him who
killeth the body, but can do nothing to the soul; but fear Him who is
able to cast both body and soul into the Gehenna of fire.  Yea, I say
unto you, fear Him.”  But that he asserted that He is really to be
feared as being a just God, to whom he says those who receive injustice
cry, is shown in a parable of which he gives the interpretation,
saying: <span id="fr_1323"></span>[1324](#fn_1323)   “If, then, the
unjust judge did so, because he was continually entreated, how much more
will the Father avenge those who cry to Him day and night?  Or do you
think that, because He bears long with them, He will not do it?  Yea, I
say to you, He will do it, and that speedily.”  Now he who speaks of God
as an avenging and rewarding God, presents Him as naturally just, and
not as good.  Moreover he gives thanks to the Lord of heaven and
earth. <span id="fr_1324"></span>[1325](#fn_1324)   But if He is Lord of
heaven and earth, He is acknowledged to be the framer of the world, and
if framer, then He is just.  When, therefore, he sometimes calls Him
good and sometimes just, he is not consistent with himself in this
point. <span id="fr_1325"></span>[1326](#fn_1325)   But his wise
disciple maintained yesterday a third point, that real sight <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[1327](#fn_1326) is more satisfactory than vision,
not knowing that real sight can be human, but that vision confessedly
proceeds from divinity.
