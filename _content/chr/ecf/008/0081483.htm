</span></p> 
<p class="c35"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p6"></A><span class="c9"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p6.1"></A>Habib</span> the martyr, clad in flame, hath called to me out of the fire,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p7"></A>That for him likewise I should fashion an image of beauty among the glorious.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p8"></A>Comrade of conquerors, lo! he beckoneth to me out of the burning,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p9"></A>That, as for the glory of his Lord, I should sing concerning him.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p10"></A>In the midst of live coals stands the <i>heroic</i> man, and lo! he calleth to me,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p11"></A>That I should fashion his image:&#160; but the blazing fire permits me not.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p12"></A>His love is fervid, glowing is his faith;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p13"></A>His fire also burneth, and who is adequate to recount his love?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p14"></A>Nay, by reason of that love which led the martyr into the fire,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p15"></A>No man is able to recount his beauties divine.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p16"></A>For who shall dare enter and see in the blazing fire</p> 
<p><a name="ix.xiv.i-p17"></A>To whom he is like, and after what pattern he is to be fashioned among the glorious?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p18"></A>Shall I fashion his image by the side of the youths, the children of the furnace?</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p19"></A>With Hananiah shall I reckon Habib?&#160; I know not.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p20"></A>Lo! these were not burned there:&#160; how, then, is he like?</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p21"></A>He, <i>I say</i>, like them, when he was burned and the youths not?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p22"></A>Which, I ask, <i>the more</i> beautiful&#8212;Habib the martyr, or Azariah?</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p23"></A>Difficult for me is the image:&#160; how I am to look upon it, I know not.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p24"></A>Lo! Michael was not burned by the flame;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p25"></A>But Habib was burned:&#160; which, then, <i>the more</i> beautiful to him that looketh upon him?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p26"></A>Who shall dare say that this is repulsive, or that;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p27"></A>Or not so comely this as that, to him that beholdeth him?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p28"></A>Three <i>there are</i> in the fire, and the flame cometh not near them;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p29"></A>But one was burned:&#160; and how shall I suffice to tell</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p30"></A>That the Fourth <i>form</i> is that of Him who went down into the midst of the furnace,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p31"></A>That He might fashion an image for Habib there along with <i>those of</i> the three?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p32"></A>He giveth a place in the fire to him who was burned,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p33"></A>That he may be, instead of Him the Fourth, by the side of the conquerors.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p34"></A>And, if of the three the beauties be glorious, though they were not burned,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p35"></A>How shall not this one, who <i>was</i> burned, be mingled with the glorious?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p36"></A>If a man have the power either to be burned or not to be burned,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p37"></A>Of this man, who was burned, more exalted was the beauty than that of the three.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p38"></A>But, inasmuch as the Lord is the control <i>of all things</i>,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p39"></A><i>He</i> is to be praised, <i>both</i> where He rescues and where He delivers up.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p40"></A>Moreover, too, the will of the three who were not burned,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p41"></A>And of him who was burned, is one and the same, in this case and in that;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3303"></A><A HREF="#fn_3303"><FONT SIZE="1">3304</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p43"></A>And, had its Lord commanded the fire to burn them,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p44"></A><i>Even</i> those three on their part, burned they would have been;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p45"></A><A NAME="page_709"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 709</FONT></A> <a name="ix.xiv.i-Page_709"></A>And, if He had signified to it that it should not burn that one man also,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p46"></A>He would not have been burned; nor had it been of himself that he was rescued.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p47"></A>To go into the fire was of their own will, when they went in;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p48"></A>But that they were not burned&#8212;<i>because</i> the Lord of the fire willed and commanded it.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p49"></A>Therefore one equal beauty is that of him who was burned,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p50"></A>And that of him who was not burned, because the will also was equal.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p51"></A>Beloved martyr! exalted is thy beauty; exalted is thy rank:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p52"></A>Graceful too thy crown, and mingled thy story with <i>that of</i> the glorious.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p53"></A>Choice gold art thou, and the fire hath tried thee, and resplendent is thy beauty.</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p54"></A>And lo! into the King&#146;s crown art thou wrought, along with the victorious.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p55"></A>Good workman! who, in the doctrine of the Son of God,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p56"></A>Pursueth his course like a valiant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3304"></A><A HREF="#fn_3304"><FONT SIZE="1">3305</FONT></A>
 man, because of the beauty of his faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p58"></A>Habib the martyr was a teacher of that which is true;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p59"></A>A preacher also, whose mouth was full of faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p60"></A>Watchful was he, and prompt <i>for service;</i> and he encouraged with his teaching</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p61"></A>The household of the house of God, through his faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p62"></A>Of light was he full, and he wrestled with the darkness</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p63"></A>Which overspread the country from the paganism which had darkened it.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p64"></A>With the Gospel of the Son was his mouth filled in the congregations;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p65"></A>And as it were a leader of the way did he become to the villages when he arrived in them.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p66"></A>Zealous he was, because he was concerned for the doctrine</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p67"></A>Divine, that he might establish the adherents&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3305"></A><A HREF="#fn_3305"><FONT SIZE="1">3306</FONT></A>
 of the faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p69"></A>At the time when the winds of the pagans blew, a lamp was he,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p70"></A>And flamed forth whilst they blew upon him, and went not out.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p71"></A>All on fire was he, and filled with the love of his Lord, and was concerned</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p72"></A>For this&#8212;that he might speak of Him without hindrance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3306"></A><A HREF="#fn_3306"><FONT SIZE="1">3307</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p74"></A>The thorns of errour sprang up in the land from paganism;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p75"></A>And, as much as in him lay, he rooted them out by his diligence.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p76"></A>He taught, admonished, and confirmed in the faith,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p77"></A>The friends of Christ,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3307"></A><A HREF="#fn_3307"><FONT SIZE="1">3308</FONT></A>
 who were harassed by persecutors.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p79"></A>Against sword and against fire did he wrestle,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p80"></A>With love hot as the flame, and was not afraid.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p81"></A>Like a two-edged brand,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3308"></A><A HREF="#fn_3308"><FONT SIZE="1">3309</FONT></A>
 keen was</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p83"></A>His faith, and against error did he contend.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p84"></A>Leaven did he prove to be in this land which had become exhausted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3309"></A><A HREF="#fn_3309"><FONT SIZE="1">3310</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p86"></A>Through fondness for the idols of vanity which error had brought in.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p87"></A>He was like salt by reason of his savoury doctrine</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p88"></A>To this region, which had become insipid through unbelief.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p89"></A>A deacon was he, and filled the place of a high-priest</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p90"></A>By the preaching and teaching of that which is true.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p91"></A>He was to the flock a good shepherd whilst he was <i>its</i> overseer;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p92"></A>And his life laid he down for the flock while he tended it.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p93"></A>He chased away the wolf, and drove off from it the beast of prey.</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p94"></A>And he repaired the breaches, and gathered the lambs into their folds.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p95"></A>He went out secretly <i>and</i> encouraged the congregations:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p96"></A>He strengthened them, and exhorted them, and held them up.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p97"></A>And he forged armour of faith, and put it on them,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p98"></A>That they might not be ignominiously overthrown&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3310"></A><A HREF="#fn_3310"><FONT SIZE="1">3311</FONT></A>
 by the paganism which abounded.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p100"></A>The flocks of the fold of the Son of God were being laid waste</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p101"></A>By persecutors:&#160; and he encouraged the lambs and the ewes.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p102"></A><A NAME="page_710"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 710</FONT></A> <a name="ix.xiv.i-Page_710"></A>And he was an advocate to the household of faith;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p103"></A>And he taught them not to be daunted by persecutors.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p104"></A>He taught them to run to meet death,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p105"></A>Without being afraid either of sword or of fire.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p106"></A>In the teaching of the Son of God he prospered,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p107"></A>So that his faith pursued its course without dread.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p108"></A>Then errour grew envious, became furious, and was maddened, because of him;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p109"></A>And she pursued after him, that she might shed upon the earth innocent blood.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p110"></A>The Defamer, who hates the race of men,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p111"></A>Laid snares for him, that he might rid the place of his presence.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3311"></A><A HREF="#fn_3311"><FONT SIZE="1">3312</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p113"></A>He who hateth the truth pursued after him to put him to death,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p114"></A>That he might make his voice to cease&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3312"></A><A HREF="#fn_3312"><FONT SIZE="1">3313</FONT></A>
 from the teaching of the house of God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p116"></A>And errour raised an outcry <i>demanding</i> that Habib should die, because she hated him;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p117"></A>Vexation goaded her on, and she sought to take away his life.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p118"></A>His story was talked about&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3313"></A><A HREF="#fn_3313"><FONT SIZE="1">3314</FONT></A>
 before the pagan judge of the country,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p120"></A>And the dear fame of him reached the king:&#160; who in great rage,</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p121"></A>And because the diadem was interwoven with paganism, decreed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3314"></A><A HREF="#fn_3314"><FONT SIZE="1">3315</FONT></A>
 death</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p123"></A>Against Habib, because he was full of faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p124"></A>And, when the command reached the judge, he armed himself</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p125"></A>With rage and fury; and, with a mind thirsting for blood,</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p126"></A>And like hunters who lay nets for the young stag,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p127"></A>After Habib did they go out to catch <i>him</i>.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p128"></A>But this man was a preacher of the faith,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p129"></A>Who in the highway of the crucifixion was prospering;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p130"></A>And, that he might benefit by his teaching the children of his people,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p131"></A>His work embraced the countries round about him.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p132"></A>So, when error went out after him, she found him not:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p133"></A>Not that he was fled, but that he had gone out to preach the Gospel.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p134"></A>Then, because of the fury of the pagans, which was great beyond all that was meet,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p135"></A>His kindred and his mother did they seize for his sake.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p136"></A>Blessed art thou, O woman! mother since thou art of the martyr.</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p137"></A>For wherefore was it that they seized thee <i>and</i> bound thee, iniquitously?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p138"></A>What do they require of thee, O thou full of beauty?&#160; What, <i>I ask</i>, have they required of thee?</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p139"></A>Lo! they require of thee that thou bring the martyr, that he may be a sacrifice.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p140"></A>Bring, oh bring thy sweet fruit to the place of the oblation&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p141"></A><i>The fruit</i> whose smell is fragrant, that it may be incense to the Godhead.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p142"></A>Fair shoot, thy cluster bring from where it is,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p143"></A>That its wine may be for a libation whose taste is sweet.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p144"></A>The lamb heard that they were seeking him, that he might be a sacrifice;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p145"></A>And he set out and came to the sacrificers rejoicing.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p146"></A>He heard that others also were being afflicted for his sake,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p147"></A>And he came that he might bear the suffering which was his, in the stead of many.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p148"></A>The lot fell on him, to be himself alone a sacrifice;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p149"></A>And the fire that was to offer him up was looking out <i>for him</i> until he came.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p150"></A>Of the many who were bound for his sake</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p151"></A>Not one single person was seized to die, but only he.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p152"></A>He it was that was worthy, and for him was martyrdom reserved;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p153"></A>And to snatch the martyr&#146;s place no man was able.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p154"></A>And therefore of his own will did he present himself</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p155"></A>To the judge, that he might be seized, and die for Jesus&#146; sake.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p156"></A>He heard that they sought him, and he came that he might be seized, even as they sought him:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p157"></A>And he went in of himself before the judge, and dauntless was his look.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p158"></A>He hid not himself, nor did he wish to flee from the judge:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p159"></A>For with light was he imbued, and from the darkness he would not flee.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p160"></A>No robber <i>was he</i>, no murderer, no thief,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p161"></A>No child of night:&#160; but all his course was run in open day.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p162"></A>Wherefore from his flock should the good shepherd flee,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p163"></A>And leave his fold to be devoured by robbers?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p164"></A>Wherefore should the physician flee, who goeth forth to heal diseases,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p165"></A>And to cure souls by the blood of the Son of God?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p166"></A><A NAME="page_711"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 711</FONT></A> <a name="ix.xiv.i-Page_711"></A>A fearless countenance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3315"></A><A HREF="#fn_3315"><FONT SIZE="1">3316</FONT></A>
 did the <i>brave</i> man carry with him, and a great heart;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p168"></A>And to meet death he ran, rejoicing, for Jesus&#146; sake.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p169"></A>He went in, he stood before the judge, saying to him:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p170"></A>I am Habib, whom ye sought:&#160; lo! <i>here</i> I stand.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p171"></A>And the pagan trembled, and amazement seized him, and he marvelled at him&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p172"></A>At the man who was not afraid, either of sword or of fire.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p173"></A>While he thought that he was fleeing apace, he entered in and mocked him;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p174"></A>And the judge shook, for he saw him courageous in the <i>very</i> face of death.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p175"></A>A disciple he of that Son of God who said:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p176"></A>&#8220;Rise, come, let us go:&#160; for he that betrayeth me lo! is here.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p177"></A>And to the crucifiers, again, He said:&#160; &#8220;Whom seek ye?&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p178"></A>They say:&#160; &#8220;Jesus.&#8221;&#160; And He said to them:&#160; &#8220;I am He.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p179"></A>The Son of God of His own will came to the cross;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p180"></A>And on Him the martyr looked, and presented himself <i>uncompelled</i> before the judge.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p181"></A>And the pagan beheld him, and was smitten with fear, and was exasperated <i>against him</i>.</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p182"></A>His rage was excited, and he began in his fury to put to him questions.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3316"></A><A HREF="#fn_3316"><FONT SIZE="1">3317</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p184"></A>And, as if he had been one who had shed on the ground the blood of the slain,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p185"></A>He proceeded to question the saintly man, but he was not ashamed:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p186"></A>Menacing him, and trying to terrify him, and to frighten him,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p187"></A>And recounting the sufferings which were being prepared by him on his account.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p188"></A>But Habib, when questioned, was not afraid,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p189"></A>Was not ashamed, and was not frightened by the menaces <i>he heard</i>.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p190"></A>Lifting up his voice, he confessed Jesus, the Son of God&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p191"></A>That he was His servant, and was His priest, and His minister.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3317"></A><A HREF="#fn_3317"><FONT SIZE="1">3318</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p193"></A>At the fury of the pagans, roaring at him like lions,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p194"></A>He trembled not, nor ceased&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3318"></A><A HREF="#fn_3318"><FONT SIZE="1">3319</FONT></A>
 from the confession of the Son of God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p196"></A>He was scourged, and the scourgings were very dear to him,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p197"></A>Seeing that he bore a little of the stripes of the Son of God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p198"></A>He was put into bonds,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3319"></A><A HREF="#fn_3319"><FONT SIZE="1">3320</FONT></A>
 and he looked on his Lord, whom also they had bound;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p200"></A>And his heart rejoiced that in the path of His sufferings he had begun to walk.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p201"></A>He ascended the block,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3320"></A><A HREF="#fn_3320"><FONT SIZE="1">3321</FONT></A>
 and they tore him with combs, but his soul was radiant with light,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p203"></A>Because he was <i>deemed</i> worthy that on him should come the agony of the sufferings of crucifixion.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p204"></A>In the pathway of death had he set his face to walk,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p205"></A>And what could he desire to find in it but sufferings?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p206"></A>The fire of sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3321"></A><A HREF="#fn_3321"><FONT SIZE="1">3322</FONT></A>
 was betrothed to him, and for her did he look;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p208"></A>And she <i>on her part</i> sent him combs, and stripes, and pains, to taste.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p209"></A>All the while that she was coming, she sent him sufferings, that by means of them</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p210"></A>He might be prepared, so that when she met him she might not dismay him.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p211"></A>Sufferings purged him, so that, when the blazing fire should put him to the proof,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p212"></A>There might not be any dross <i>found</i> in his choice gold.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p213"></A>And he endured the whole of the pains that came upon him,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p214"></A>That he might have experience <i>of suffering</i>, and in the burning stand like a brave man.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p215"></A>And he accepted rejoicing the sufferings which he had to bear:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p216"></A>For he knew that at their termination he should find death.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p217"></A>And he was not afraid, either of death or of sufferings:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p218"></A>For with that wine of the crucifixion his heart was drunk.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p219"></A>He despised his body, while it was being dragged along by the persecutors;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p220"></A>And his limbs, while they were being torn asunder in bitter agony.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3322"></A><A HREF="#fn_3322"><FONT SIZE="1">3323</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p222"></A>Scourges on his back, combs on his sides, stocks on his feet,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p223"></A>And fire in front of him:&#160; still was he brave and full of faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p224"></A>They taunted him: &#160;Lo! thou worshippest a man;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p225"></A>But he said:&#160; A man I worship not,</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p226"></A>But God, who took a body and became man:</p>

<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p228"></A>The faith of Habib, the martyr, was full of light</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p229"></A>And by it was enlightened Edessa, the faithful <i>city</i>.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p230"></A>The daughter of Abgar, whom Add&aelig;us betrothed to the crucifixion&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p231"></A>Through it is her light, through it her truth and her faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p232"></A>Her king is from it, her martyrs from it, her truth from it;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p233"></A>The teachers also of <i>her</i> faith are from it.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p234"></A>Abgar believed that Thou art God, the Son of God;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p235"></A>And he received a blessing because of the beauty of his faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p236"></A>Sharbil the martyr, son of the Edess&aelig;ans, more-ever said:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p237"></A>My heart is led captive by God, who became man.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p238"></A>And Habib the martyr, who also was crowned at Edessa,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p239"></A>Confessed these things:&#160; that He took a body and became man;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p240"></A>That He is the Son of God, and also is God, and became man.</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p241"></A>Edessa learned from teachers the things that are true:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p242"></A>Her king taught her, her martyrs taught her, the faith;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p243"></A>But to others, who were fraudulent teachers, she would not hearken.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p244"></A>Habib the martyr, in the ear of Edessa, thus cried aloud</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p245"></A>Out of the midst of the fire:&#160; A man I worship not,</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p246"></A>But God, who took a body and became man</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p247"></A>Him do I worship.&#160; <i>Thus</i> confessed the martyr with uplifted voice.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p248"></A>From confessors torn with combs, burnt, raised up <i>on the block</i>, slain</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p249"></A>And <i>from</i> a righteous king, did Edessa learn the faith,</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p250"></A>And she knows our Lord&#8212;that He is even God, the Son of God;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p251"></A>She also learned and firmly believed that He took a body and became man.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p252"></A>Not from common scribes did she learn the faith:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p253"></A>Her king taught her, her martyrs taught her; and she firmly believed them:</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p254"></A>And, if she be calumniated as having ever worshipped a man,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p255"></A>She points to her martyrs, who died for Him as being God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p256"></A>A man I worship not, said Habib,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p257"></A>Because it is written:&#160; &#8220;Cursed is he that putteth his trust in a man.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3323"></A><A HREF="#fn_3323"><FONT SIZE="1">3324</FONT></A>
</p>

<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p260"></A>For His sake, nor will I renounce His faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p261"></A>This truth has Edessa held fast from her youth,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p262"></A>And in her old age she will not barter it away as a daughter of the poor.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p263"></A>Her righteous king became to her a scribe, and from him she learned</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p264"></A>Concerning our Lord&#8212;that He is the Son of God, yea God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p265"></A>Add&aelig;us, who brought the bridegroom&#146;s ring and put it on her hand,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p266"></A>Betrothed her thus to the Son of God, who is the Only-<i>begotten</i>.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p267"></A>Sharbil the priest, who made trial and proof of all gods,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p268"></A>Died, even as he said, &#8220;for God who became man.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p269"></A>Shamuna and Guria, for the sake of the Only-<i>begotten</i>,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p270"></A>Stretched out their necks <i>to receive the stroke</i>, and for Him died, forasmuch as He is God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p271"></A>And Habib the martyr, who was teacher of congregations,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p272"></A>Preached of Him, that He took a body and became man.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p273"></A>For a man the martyr would not have <i>submitted to be</i> burned in the fire;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p274"></A>But he was burned &#8220;for the sake of God who became man.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p275"></A>And Edessa is witness that thus he confessed while he was being burned:</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p276"></A>And from the confession of a martyr that has been burned who is he that can escape?</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p277"></A>All minds does faith reduce to silence and despise&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p278"></A><i>She</i> that is full of light and stoopeth not to shadows.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p279"></A>She despiseth him that maligns the Son by denying that He is God;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p280"></A>Him too that saith &#8220;He took not a body and became man.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p281"></A>In faith which was full of truth he stood upon the fire;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p282"></A>And he became incense, and propitiated with his fragrance the Son of God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p283"></A>In all <i>his</i> afflictions, and in all <i>his</i> tortures, and in all <i>his</i> sufferings,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p284"></A>Thus did he confess, and thus did he teach the blessed <i>city</i>.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p285"></A>And this truth did Edessa hold fast touching our Lord&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p286"></A>Even that He is God, and of Mary became a man.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p287"></A>And the bride hates him that denies His God-head,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p288"></A>And despises and contemns him that maligns His corporeal nature.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p289"></A>And she recognises Him <i>as</i> One in Godhead and in manhood&#8212;</p>

<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p291"></A>And thus did the daughter of the Parthians learn to believe,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p292"></A>And thus did she firmly hold, and thus does she teach him that listens to her.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p293"></A>The judge, therefore, full of <i>zeal for</i> paganism, commanded</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p294"></A>That the martyr should be led forth and burned in the fire which was reserved for him.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p295"></A>And forthwith a strap was thrust into his mouth, as <i>though he had been</i> a murderer,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p296"></A>His confession being kept within his heart towards God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p297"></A>And they hurried him away, and he went out from the judgment-hall, rejoicing</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p298"></A>That the hour was come when the crown should be given to his faith.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p299"></A>And there went out with him crowds of people, that they might bear him company,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p300"></A>Looking upon him, not as a dead man accompanied <i>to his burial</i>,</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p301"></A>But as a man who was going away that by means of fire he might become a bridegroom,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p302"></A>And that there might be bestowed the crown which was by righteousness reserved for him.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p303"></A>They looked upon him as upon a man entering into battle,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p304"></A>And around him were spears, and lances, and swords, but he vanquished them.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p305"></A>They beheld him going up like a champion from the contest,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p306"></A>And in his triumph chaplets were brought to him by those who beheld.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p307"></A>They looked upon him as he vanquished principalities and powers,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p308"></A>Which all made war with him, and he put them to shame.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p309"></A>The whole congregation of the followers of Christ exulted over him,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p310"></A>Because he raised up the friends&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3324"></A><A HREF="#fn_3324"><FONT SIZE="1">3325</FONT></A>
 of the faith by the sufferings which he bore.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p312"></A>There went forth with him the Church, a bride full of light;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p313"></A>And her face was beaming on the beloved martyr who was united to her.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p314"></A>Then did his mother, because it was the marriage-feast for her son,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p315"></A>Deck herself in garments nobler than her wont.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p316"></A>Since sordid raiment suited not the banquet-hall,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p317"></A>In magnificent <i>attire</i> all white she clad herself right tastefully.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p318"></A>Hither to the battle came down love to fight</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p319"></A>In the mother&#146;s soul&#8212;<i>the love</i> of nature, and <i>the love</i> of God.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p320"></A>She looked upon her son as he went forth to be put into the flame;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p321"></A>And, forasmuch as there was in her the love of the Lord, she suffered not.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p322"></A>The yearnings of her mother&#146;s womb cried out on behalf of its fruit;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p323"></A>But faith silenced them, so that their tumult ceased.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p324"></A>Nature shrieked over the limb which was severed from her;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p325"></A>But the love of the Lord intoxicated the soul, that she should not perceive it.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p326"></A>Nature loved, but the love of the Lord did conquer in the strife</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p327"></A>Within the soul of the mother, that she should not grieve for her beloved.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p328"></A>And instead of suffering, her heart was filled with all emotions of joy;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p329"></A>And, instead of mourning, she went forth in splendid apparel.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p330"></A>And she accompanied him as he went out to be burned, and was elate,</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p331"></A>Because the love of the Lord vanquished that of nature.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p332"></A>And <i>clad</i> in white, as for a bridegroom, she made a marriage-feast&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p333"></A><i>She</i> the mother of the martyr, and was blithe because of him.</p>

<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p336"></A>One she had, and she gave him to be food for the fire;</p> 
<p class="c59"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p337"></A>And, even as that one, if she had had seven, she had given <i>them all</i>.</p> 
<p class="c57"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p338"></A>He was cast into the fire, and the blaze kindled around him;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p4"></A> The <span class="c9"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p4.1"></A>ms.</span> from which this is taken is Cod. Add. 17,158, fol. 30 vers.&#160; Mar Jacob, bishop of Sarug, or Batn&aelig;, was one of the most learned and celebrated among all the Syriac writers.&#160; He was born <span class="c9"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p4.2"></A>a.d.</span> 452, made bishop of Sarug <span class="c9"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p4.3"></A>a.d.</span> 519, and died <span class="c9"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p4.4"></A>a.d.</span> 521.&#160; He was the author of several liturgical works, epistles, and sermons, and, amongst these, of numerous metrical homilies, of which two are given here.&#160; Assemani enumerates no less than 231.&#160; Ephraem Syrus also wrote a similar homily on Habib, Shamuna, and Guria.</p> 
<p><a name="ix.xiv.i-p5"></A>The metre of the original in this and the following homily consists of twelve syllables, and six dissyllabic feet; but whether they were read as iambs ortroches, or as both, appears to depend on the nature of the Syriac accentuation, which is still an unsettled question.&#160; Hoffmann, in his slight notice of the subject (<i>Gram. Syr</i>., &sect; 13), merely says:&#160; &#8220;Scimus, po&euml;sin Syriacam non quantitatis sed <i>accentus</i> tantum rationem habere, versusque suos <i>syllabarum numero</i> metiri.&#160; Qu&acirc; tamen po&euml;seos Syriac&aelig; conditione <i>varietas morarum in pronuntiandis vocalibus observandarum</i> non tollitur.&#8221;&#8212;<span class="c9"><a name="ix.xiv.i-p5.1"></A>Tr.</span></p>
