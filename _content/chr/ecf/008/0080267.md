id="vi.iii.v.lvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXVII.—Invitation to
Baptism.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.lvii-p2"></span>When he had given them these and such
like precepts, he made proclamation to the people, saying:  “Since I
have resolved to stay three months with you, if any one desires it, let
him be baptized; that, stripped of his former evils, he may for the
future, in consequence of his own conduct, become heir of heavenly
blessings, as a reward for his good actions.  Whosoever will, then, let
him come to Zacchæus and give his name to him, and let him hear from him
the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.  Let him attend to frequent
fastings, and approve himself in all things, that at the end of these
three months he may be baptized on the day of the festival.  But every
one of you shall be baptized in ever flowing waters, the name of the
Trine Beatitude being invoked over him; he being first anointed with oil
sanctified by prayer, that so at length, being consecrated by these
things, he may attain a perception of holy things.” <span

<span id="vi.iii.v.lvii-p3"></span> This may be translated, “that he may
partake of holy things.”  Cotelerius supposes the words “holy things” to
mean the body and blood of Christ.
