<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvi.viii-p2"></A>And the Lord stretched out His hand, and said:&#160; Come to me, all my saints, who have my image and likeness.&#160; Do you, who have been condemned through the tree and the devil and death, now see the devil and death condemned through the tree.&#160; Immediately all the saints were brought together under the hand of the Lord.&#160; And the Lord, holding Adam by the right hand, said to him:&#160; Peace be to thee, with all thy children, my righteous ones!&#160; And Adam fell down at the knees of the Lord, and with tearful entreaty praying, said with a loud voice:&#160; I will extol Thee, O Lord; for Thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.&#160; O Lord God, I cried unto Thee, and Thou hast healed me.&#160; O Lord, Thou hast brought out my soul from the powers below; Thou hast saved me from them that go down into the pit.&#160; Sing praises to the Lord, all His saints, and confess to the memory of His holiness; since there is anger in His indignation, and life in His goodwill.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1986"></A><A HREF="#fn_1986"><FONT SIZE="1">1987</FONT></A>
&#160; In like manner also all the saints of God, falling on their knees at the feet of the Lord, said with one voice:&#160; Thou hast come, O Redeemer of the world:&#160; as Thou hast foretold by the law and Thy prophets, so hast Thou fulfilled by Thy deeds.&#160; Thou hast redeemed the living by Thy cross; and by the death of the cross Thou hast come down to us, to rescue us from the powers below, and from death, by Thy majesty.&#160; O Lord, as Thou hast set the title of Thy glory in heaven, and hast erected as the title of redemption Thy cross upon earth, so, O Lord, set in Hades the sign of the victory of Thy cross, that death may no more have dominion.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvi.viii-p4"></A>And the Lord, stretching forth His hand, made the sign of the cross upon Adam and upon all His saints; and holding Adam by the right hand, went up from the powers below:&#160; and all the saints followed Him.&#160; Then holy David cried out aloud, saying:&#160; Sing unto the Lord a new song, for He hath done wonderful things; His right hand and His holy arm have brought salvation to Himself.&#160; The Lord hath made known His salvation; His righteousness hath He revealed in the sight of the heathen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1987"></A><A HREF="#fn_1987"><FONT SIZE="1">1988</FONT></A>
&#160; And all the multitude of the saints answered, saying:&#160; This is glory to all His saints.&#160; Amen, alleluia.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvi.viii-p6"></A>And after this the prophet Habacuc cried out, saying:&#160; Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, to deliver Thine elect.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1988"></A><A HREF="#fn_1988"><FONT SIZE="1">1989</FONT></A>
&#160; And all the saints answered, saying:&#160; Blessed is He who <A NAME="page_452"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 452</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xvi.viii-Page_452"></A>cometh in the name of the Lord; God is the Lord, and He hath shone upon us.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1989"></A><A HREF="#fn_1989"><FONT SIZE="1">1990</FONT></A>
&#160; Amen, alleluia.&#160; In like manner after this the prophet Mich&aelig;as as also cried out, saying:&#160; Who is a God like unto thee, O Lord, taking away iniquities and passing by sins?&#160; And now Thou dost withhold Thine anger for a testimony <i>against us</i>, because Thou delightest in mercy.&#160; And Thou turnest again, and hast compassion upon us, and pardonest all our iniquities; and all our sins hast Thou sunk in the multitude of death,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1990"></A><A HREF="#fn_1990"><FONT SIZE="1">1991</FONT></A>
 as Thou hast sworn unto our fathers in the days of old.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1991"></A><A HREF="#fn_1991"><FONT SIZE="1">1992</FONT></A>
&#160; And all the saints answered, saying:&#160; This is our God to eternity, and for ever and ever; and He will direct us for evermore.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1992"></A><A HREF="#fn_1992"><FONT SIZE="1">1993</FONT></A>
&#160; Amen, alleluia.&#160; So also all the prophets, quoting the sacred <i>writings</i> concerning His praises,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1993"></A><A HREF="#fn_1993"><FONT SIZE="1">1994</FONT></A>
 and all the saints crying, Amen, alleluia, followed the Lord.</p>
