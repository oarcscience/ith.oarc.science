<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.ii-p2"></A>Then the old man proceeded to say:&#160; &#8220;I saw you bathe in the sea, and afterwards retire into a secret place; wherefore observing, without your noticing me, what you were doing, I saw you praying.&#160; Therefore, pitying your error, I waited till you came out, that I might speak to you, and instruct you not to err in an observance of this sort; because there is neither any God, nor any worship, neither is there any providence in the world, but all things are done by fortuitous chance and <i>genesis</i>, as I have discovered most clearly for myself, being accomplished beyond others in the discipline of learning.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_806"></A><A HREF="#fn_806"><FONT SIZE="1">807</FONT></A>
&#160; Do not err, therefore:&#160; for whether you pray, or whether you do not pray, whatever your <i>genesis</i> contains, that shall befall you.&#8221;&#160; Then I Clement was affected, I know not how, in my heart, recollecting many things in him that seemed familiar to me; for some one says well, that that which is sprung from any one, although it may be long absent, yet a spark of relationship is never extinguished.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_807"></A><A HREF="#fn_807"><FONT SIZE="1">808</FONT></A>
&#160; Therefore I began to ask of him who and whence he was, and how descended.&#160; But he, not wishing to answer these questions, said:&#160; &#8220;What has that to do with what I have told you?&#160; But first, if you please, let us converse of those matters which we have propounded; and afterwards, if circumstances require, we can disclose to one another, as friends to friends, our names, and families, and country, and other things connected with these.&#8221;&#160; Yet we all admired the eloquence of the man, and the gravity of his manners, and the calmness of his speech.</p>
