<p class="c51"><a name="ix.xiii.x-p3"></A>Reign of Sanadroug; murder of Abgar&#146;s children; the princess Helena.</p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.xiii.x-p4"></A>Sanadroug, being on the throne, raises troops with the help of the brave Pacradouni and Ardzrouni, who had exalted him, and goes to wage war upon the children of Abgar, to make him self master of the whole kingdom.&#160; Whilst Sanadroug was occupied with these affairs, as if by an effect of divine providence vengeance was taken for the death of Att&aelig;us; for a marble column which the son of Abgar was having erected at Edessa, on the summit of his palace, while he was underneath to direct the work, escaped from the hands of the workmen, fell upon him and crushed his feet.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiii.x-p5"></A>Immediately there came a message from the inhabitants of the town, asking Sanadroug for a treaty by which he should engage not to disturb them in the exercise of the Christian religion, in consideration of which, they would give up the town and the king&#146;s treasures.&#160; Sanadroug promised, but in the end violated his oath.&#160; Sanadroug put all the children of the house of Abgar to the edge of the sword, with the exception of the daughters, whom he withdrew from the town to place them in the canton of Hachdiank.&#160; As to the first of Abgar&#146;s wives, named Helena, he sent her to his town at Kharan, and left to her the sovereignty of the whole of Mesopotamia, in remembrance of the benefits he had received from Abgar by Helena&#146;s means.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xiii.x-p6"></A>Helena, pious like her husband Abgar, did not wish to live in the midst of idolaters; she went away to Jerusalem in the time of Claudius, during the famine which Agabus had predicted; with all her treasures she bought in Egypt an immense quantity of corn, which she distributed <A NAME="page_707"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 707</FONT></A> <a name="ix.xiii.x-Page_707"></A>amongst the poor, a fact to which Josephus testifies. Helena&#146;s tomb, a truly remarkable one, is still to be seen before the gate of Jerusalem.</p>
