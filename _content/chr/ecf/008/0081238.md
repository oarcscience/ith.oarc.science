id="vii.x.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—How Jesus Went Out of
Egypt.</span>

<span id="vii.x.iii-p2"></span>And, lo, the angel of the Lord met Mary,
and said to her:  Take up the boy, and return into the land of the Jews,
for they who sought His life are dead.  And Mary rose up with Jesus; and
they proceeded into the city of Nazareth, which is among the possessions
of her father.  And when Joseph went out of Egypt after the death of
Herod, he kept Him in the desert until there should be quietness in
Jerusalem on the part of those who were seeking the boy’s life.  And he
gave thanks to God because He had given him understanding, and because
he had found favour in the presence of the Lord God.  Amen.
