<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lxiv-p2"></A>When Appion heard this, and those who were with him, they raised a great howling, saying:&#160; &#8220;Why have you done this?&#160; Why did you not receive him?&#8221;&#160; And when Athenodorus was going to tell me that it was my father Faustinianus himself, Appion prevented him, and said:&#160; <A NAME="page_209"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 209</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.xii.lxiv-Page_209"></A>&#8220;We have learned from some one that he has gone with Simon, and that at the entreaty of Faustinianus himself, being unwilling to see his sons, because they are Jews.&#160; When therefore we heard this, we came to inquire after him here; but since he is not here, it appears that he must have spoken truly who told us that he has gone with Simon.&#160; This, therefore, we tell you.&#8221;&#160; But I Clement, when I understood the designs of Peter, that he wished to make them suppose that the old man would be required at their hands, so that they might be afraid and flee away, I began to aid his design, and said to Appion:&#160; &#8220;Listen, dear Appion:&#160; what we believe to be good, we wish to deliver to our father also; but if he will not receive it, but rather, as you say, flees away through abhorrence of us&#8212;it may perhaps be harsh to say so&#8212;we care nothing about him.&#8221;&#160; And when I had said this, they departed, cursing my cruelty, and followed the track of Simon, as we learned on the following day.</p>
