<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.ix.x-p2"></A>&#8220;And I must ask you to think of all such stories as embodying some such allegory.&#160; Look on Apollo as the wandering Sun (<span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.ix.x-p2.1"></A>peri-pol&ocirc;n</span>), a son of Zeus, who was also called Mithras, as completing the period of a year.&#160; And these said transformations of the all-pervading Zeus must be regarded as the numerous changes of the seasons, while his numberless wives you must understand to be years, or generations.&#160; For the power which proceeds from the &aelig;ther and passes through the air unites with all the years and generations in turn, and continually varies them, and so produces or destroys the crops.&#160; And ripe fruits are called his children, the barrenness of some seasons being referred to unlawful unions.&#8221;</p>
