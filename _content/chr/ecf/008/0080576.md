Antioch.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.lxviii-p2"></span>But Simon began, though secretly,
to go amongst his friends and acquaintances, and to malign Peter more

coming hither again, speaking against Peter.”  These things being known

people to meet on the following day; and having ordained one of those
who followed him as bishop over them, and others as presbyters, and
having baptized multitudes, and restored to health all who were troubled

through Niceta and Aquila, that Peter was coming.  Then all the people
of the city of Antioch, hearing of Peter’s arrival, went to meet him,
and almost all the old men and the nobles came with ashes sprinkled on
their heads, in this way testifying their repentance, because they had
listened to the magician Simon, in opposition to his preaching.
