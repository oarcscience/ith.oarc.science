<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.viii.v-p2"></A>&#8220;Then Appion said:&#160; &#145;Admit that I know more of these things than you do.&#160; However, that you may not think that there is nothing in what you have heard from me in reference to what you have said, I will tell you how the demons are under necessity to obey the magicians in the matters about which they are commanded.&#160; For as it is impossible for a soldier to contradict his general, and impossible for the generals themselves to disobey the king&#8212;for if any one oppose those set over him, he is altogether deserving of punishment&#8212;so it is impossible for the demons not to serve the angels who are their generals; and when they are adjured by them, they yield trembling, well knowing that if they disobey they shall be fully punished.&#160; But the angels also themselves, being adjured by the magicians in the name of their ruler, obey, lest, being found guilty of disobedience, they be destroyed.&#160; For unless all things that are living and rational foresaw vengeance from the ruler, confusion would ensue, all revolting against one another.&#146;</p>
