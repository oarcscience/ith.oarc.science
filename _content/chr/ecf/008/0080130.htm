<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lxviii-p2"></A>&#8220;These sayings of Gamaliel did not much please Caiaphas; and holding him in suspicion, as it seemed, he began to insinuate himself cunningly into the discussions:&#160; for, smiling at what Gamaliel had said, the chief of the priests asked of James, the chief of the bishops,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">594</FONT></A>
 that the discourse concerning Christ should not be drawn but from the Scriptures; &#145;that we may know,&#146; said he, &#145;whether Jesus be the very Christ or no.&#146;&#160; Then said James, &#145;We must first inquire from what Scriptures we are especially to derive our discussion.&#146;&#160; Then he, with difficulty, at length overcome by reason, answered, that it must be derived from the law; and afterwards he made mention also of the prophets.&#8221;</p>
