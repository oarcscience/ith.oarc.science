<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xvii-p2"></A>&#8220;But, inasmuch as inborn affection towards God the Creator seemed to suffice for salvation to those who loved Him, the enemy studies to pervert this affection in men, and to render them hostile and ungrateful to their Creator.&#160; For I call heaven and earth to witness, that if God permitted the enemy to rage as much as he desires, all men should have perished long ere now; but for His mercy&#146;s sake God doth not suffer him.&#160; But if men would turn their affection towards God, all would doubtless be saved, even if for some faults they might seem to be corrected for righteousness.&#160; But now the most of men have been made enemies of God, whose hearts the wicked one has entered, and has turned aside towards himself the affection which God the Creator had implanted in them, that they might have it towards Him.&#160; But of the rest, who seemed for a time to be watchful, the enemy, appearing in a phantasy of glory and splendour, and promising them certain great and mighty things, has caused their mind and heart to wander away from God; yet it is for some just reason that he is permitted to accomplish these things.&#8221;</p>
