<p class="c42"><a name="x.vi.ii.iv-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="x.vi.ii.iv-p1.1"></A>Concerning His Journey to Rome, and the Jewish Sects.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3703"></A><A HREF="#fn_3703"><FONT SIZE="1">3704</FONT></A>
</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="x.vi.ii.iv-p3"></A>And the church of the Corinthians continued in the orthodox faith&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3704"></A><A HREF="#fn_3704"><FONT SIZE="1">3705</FONT></A>
 up to the time when Primus was bishop in Corinth.&#160; I had some intercourse with these <i>brethren</i> on my voyage to Rome, when I spent several days with the Corinthians, during which we were mutually refreshed by the orthodox faith.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.vi.ii.iv-p5"></A>On my arrival at Rome, I drew up a list of the succession <i>of bishops</i> down to Anicetus, whose deacon was Eleutherus.&#160; To Anicetus succeeded Soter, and after him <i>came</i> Eleutherus.&#160; But in the case of every succession,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3705"></A><A HREF="#fn_3705"><FONT SIZE="1">3706</FONT></A>
 and in every city, the state of affairs is in accordance with the teaching of the Law and of the Prophets and of the Lord.&#8230;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.vi.ii.iv-p7"></A>And after James the Just had suffered martyrdom, as had the Lord also <i>and</i> on the same account, again Symeon the son of Clopas, descended from <i>the Lord&#146;s</i> uncle, is made bishop, his election being promoted by all as being a kinsman of the Lord.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.vi.ii.iv-p8"></A>Therefore was the Church called a virgin, for she was not as yet corrupted by worthless teaching.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3706"></A><A HREF="#fn_3706"><FONT SIZE="1">3707</FONT></A>
&#160; Thebulis it was who, <i>displeased</i> because he was not made bishop, first began to corrupt her by stealth.&#160; He too was connected with the seven sects which existed among the people, like Simon, from whom come the Simoniani; and Cleobius, from whom come the Cleobiani; and Doritheus, from whom come the Dorithiani; and Gorth&aelig;us, from whom come the Gortheani; Masboth&aelig;us, from whom come the Masboth&aelig;i.&#160; From these <i>men</i> also come the Menandrianists, and the Marcionists, and the Carpocratians, and the Valentinians, and the Basilidians, and the Saturnilians.&#160; Each <i>of these leaders</i> in his own private and distinct capacity brought in his own private opinion.&#160; From these have come false Christs, false prophets, false apostles&#8212;men who have split up the one Church into parts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3707"></A><A HREF="#fn_3707"><FONT SIZE="1">3708</FONT></A>
 through their corrupting doctrines, <i>uttered</i> in disparagement of God and of His Christ.&#8230;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.vi.ii.iv-p11"></A>There were, moreover, various opinions in the <A NAME="page_765"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 765</FONT></A> <a name="x.vi.ii.iv-Page_765"></A>matter of circumcision among the children of Israel, held by those who were opposed to the tribe of Judah and to Christ:&#160; such as the Essenes, the Galileans, the Hemerobaptists, the Masboth&aelig;i, the Samaritans, the Sadducees, the Pharisees.</p>
