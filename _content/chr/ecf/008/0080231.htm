<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xxi-p2"></A>But on the following day, Peter, as usual, rising before dawn, found us already awake and ready to listen; and thus began:&#160; &#8220;I entreat you, my brethren and fellow-servants, that if any of you is not able to wake, he should not torment himself through respect to my presence, because sudden change is difficult; but if for a long time one gradually accustoms himself, that will not be distressing which comes of use.&#160; For we had not all the same training; although in course of time we shall be able to be moulded into one habit, for they say that custom holds the place of a second nature.&#160; But I call God to witness that I am not offended, if any one is not able to wake; but rather by this, if, when any one sleeps all through the night, he does not in the course of the day fulfil that which he omitted in the night.&#160; For it is necessary to give heed intently and unceasingly, to the study of doctrine, that our mind may be filled with the thought of God only:&#160; because in the mind which is filled with the thought of God, no place will be given to the wicked one.&#8221;</p>
