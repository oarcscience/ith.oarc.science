<span id="vi.iv.xix.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xix.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—The Same Subject
Continued.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xix.ii-p2"></span>“I heard that you promised yesterday
to Faustus to prove this day, giving out your arguments in regular
order, and beginning with Him who is Lord of the universe, that we ought
to say that He alone is God, and that we ought neither to say nor to
think that there are other gods, because he that acts contrary to this
will be punished eternally.  But, above all, I am truly amazed at your
madness in hoping to convert a wise man, and one far advanced in years,
to your state of mind.  But you will not succeed in your designs; and
all the more that I am present, and can thoroughly refute your false
arguments.  For perhaps, if I had not been present, the wise old man
might have been led astray, because he has no critical
acquaintance <span id="fr_1248"></span>[1249](#fn_1248) with the books
publicly believed in amongst the Jews. <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1250](#fn_1249)   At present I shall omit much, in
order that I may the more speedily refute that which you have promised
to prove.  Wherefore begin to speak what you promised to say before us,
who know the Scriptures.  But if, fearing our refutation, you are
unwilling to fulfil your promise in our presence, this of itself will be
sufficient proof that you are wrong, because you did venture to speak in
the presence of those who know the Scriptures.  And now, why should I
wait till you tell me, when I have a most satisfactory witness of your
promise in the old man who is present?”  And, saying this, he looked to
my father, and said:  “Tell me, most excellent of all men, is not this
the man who promised to prove to you to-day that God is one, and that we
ought not to say or think that there is any other god, and that he who
acts contrary to this will be punished eternally, as committing the most
heinous sin?  Do you, then, refuse to reply to me?”

Cotelerius translates:  “the books which were publically entrusted to
the Jews.”  One <span class="c9"><span
