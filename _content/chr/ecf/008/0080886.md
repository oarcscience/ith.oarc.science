<span id="vi.iv.xii.iii-p2"></span>“Therefore straightway after the
flood, <span id="fr_1108"></span>[1109](#fn_1108) Noe continued to live
three hundred and fifty years with the multitude of his descendants in
concord, being a king according to the image of the one God.  But after
his death many of his descendants were ambitious of the kingdom, and
being eager to reign, each one considered how it might be effected; and
one attempted it by war, another by deceit, another by persuasion, and
one in one way and another in another; one of whom was of the family of
Ham, whose descendant was Mestren, from whom the tribes of the Egyptians
and Babylonians and Persians were multiplied.
