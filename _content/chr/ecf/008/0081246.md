id="vii.x.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—How Jesus Made a Short Piece of
Wood of the Same Length as a Longer One.</span>

<span id="vii.x.xi-p2"></span>And Jesus reached the age of eight years. 
Joseph was a master builder, <span id="fr_1769"></span>[1770](#fn_1769)
and used to make ploughs and ox-yokes.  And one day a rich man <span
id="page_403">p. 403</span> <span id="vii.x.xi-Page_403"></span>said to
Joseph:  Master, make me a couch, both useful and beautiful.  And Joseph
was in distress, because the wood which he had brought <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[1771](#fn_1770) for the work was too short.  And
Jesus said to him:  Do not be annoyed.  Take hold of this piece of wood
by one end, and I by the other; I and let us draw it out.  And they did
so; and immediately he found it useful for that which he wished.  And He
said to Joseph:  Behold, do the work which thou wishest.  And Joseph,
seeing what He had done, embraced Him, and said:  Blessed am I, because
God hath given me such a son.

<span id="vii.x.xi-p3"></span> But probably *architector* here is equal
to <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.x.xi-p3.1"></span>τέκτων</span>, a
carpenter.

<span id="vii.x.xi-p4"></span> Perhaps *sectum*, cut, is the true
reading, and not *actum*.
