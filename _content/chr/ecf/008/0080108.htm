<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xlvi-p2"></A>&#8220;But now also I shall, by a very short representation, recall you to the recollection of all these things.&#160; In the present life, Aaron, the first high priest,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">579</FONT></A>
 was anointed with a composition of chrism, which was made after the pattern of that spiritual ointment of which we have spoken before.&#160; He was prince of the people, and as a king received first-fruits and tribute from the people, man by man; and having undertaken the office <A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iii.xlvi-Page_90"></A>of judging the people, he judged of things clean and things unclean.&#160; But if any one else was anointed with the same ointment, as deriving virtue from it, he became either king, or prophet, or priest.&#160; If, then, this temporal grace, compounded by men, had such efficacy, consider now how potent was that ointment extracted by God from a branch of the tree of life, when that which was made by men could confer so excellent dignities among men.&#160; For what in the present age is more glorious than a prophet, more illustrious than a priest, more exalted than a king?&#8221;</p>
