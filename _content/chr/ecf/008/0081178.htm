<p class="c2"><a name="vii.v.i-p2"></A> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.i-p3"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vii.v.i-p3.1"></A>Here</span> beginneth the book of the Birth of the Blessed Mary and the Infancy of the Saviour.&#160; Written in Hebrew by the Blessed Evangelist Matthew, and translated into Latin by the Blessed Presbyter Jerome.</p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.i-p4"></A>To their well-beloved brother Jerome the Presbyter, Bishops Cromatius and Heliodorus in the Lord, greeting.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.i-p5"></A>The birth of the Virgin Mary, and the nativity and infancy of our Lord Jesus Christ, we find in apocryphal books.&#160; But considering that in them many things contrary to our faith are written, we have believed that they ought all to be rejected, lest perchance we should transfer the joy of Christ to Antichrist.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1612"></A><A HREF="#fn_1612"><FONT SIZE="1">1613</FONT></A>
&#160; While, therefore, we were considering these things, there came holy men, Parmenius and Varinus, who said that your Holiness had found a Hebrew volume, written by the hand of the most blessed Evangelist Matthew, in which also the birth of the virgin mother herself, and the infancy of our Saviour, were written.&#160; And accordingly we entreat your affection by our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, to render it from the Hebrew into Latin,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1613"></A><A HREF="#fn_1613"><FONT SIZE="1">1614</FONT></A>
 not so much for the attainment of those things which are the insignia of Christ, as for the exclusion of the craft of heretics, who, in order to teach bad doctrine, have mingled their own lies with the excellent nativity of Christ, that by the sweetness of life they might hide the bitterness of death.&#160; It will therefore become your purest piety, either to listen to us as your brethren entreating, or to let us have as bishops exacting, the debt of affection which you may deem due.</p> 
<p class="c35"><a name="vii.v.i-p8"></A><span class="c1"><a name="vii.v.i-p8.1"></A>Reply to Their Letter by Jerome.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.i-p9"></A>To my lords the holy and most blessed Bishops Cromatius and Heliodorus, Jerome, a humble servant of Christ, in the Lord greeting.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.i-p10"></A>He who digs in ground where he knows that there is gold,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1614"></A><A HREF="#fn_1614"><FONT SIZE="1">1615</FONT></A>
 does not instantly snatch at whatever the uptorn trench may pour forth; but, before the stroke of the quivering spade raises aloft the glittering mass, he meanwhile lingers over the sods to turn them over and lift them up, and especially he who has not added to his gains.&#160; An arduous task is enjoined upon me, since what your Blessedness has commanded me, the holy Apostle and Evangelist Matthew himself did not write for the purpose of publishing.&#160; For if he had not done it somewhat secretly, he would have added it also to his Gospel which he published.&#160; But he composed this book in Hebrew; and so little did he publish it, that at this day the book written in Hebrew by his own hand is in the possession of very religious men, to whom in successive periods of time it has been handed down by those that were before them.&#160; And this book they never at any time gave to any one to translate.&#160; And so it came to pass, that when it was published by a disciple of Manich&aelig;us named Leucius, who also wrote the falsely styled Acts of the Apostles, this book afforded matter, not of edification, but of perdition; and the opinion of the Synod in regard to it was according to its deserts, that the ears of the Church should not be open to it.&#160; Let the snapping of those that bark against us now cease; for we do not add this little book to the canonical writings, but we translate what was written by an Apostle and Evangelist, that we may disclose the falsehood of heresy.&#160; In this work, then, we obey the commands of pious bishops as well as oppose impious heretics.&#160; It is the love of Christ, therefore, which we fulfil, believing that they will assist us by their prayers, who through our obedience attain to a knowledge of the holy infancy of our Saviour.</p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.i-p12"></A>There is extant another letter to the same bishops, attributed to Jerome:&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.i-p13"></A>You ask me to let you know what I think of a book held by some to be about the nativity of St. Mary.&#160; And so I wish you to know that there is much in it that is false.&#160; For one Seleucus, who wrote the Sufferings of the Apostles, composed this book.&#160; But, just as he wrote what was true about their powers, and the miracles they worked, but said a great deal that was false about their doctrine; so here too he has invented many untruths out of his own head.&#160; I shall take care to render it word for word, exactly as it is in the <A NAME="page_369"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 369</FONT></A> <a name="vii.v.i-Page_369"></A>Hebrew, since it is asserted that it was composed by the holy Evangelist Matthew, and written in Hebrew, and set at the head of his Gospel.&#160; Whether this be true or not, I leave to the author of the preface and the trustworthiness of the writer:&#160; as for myself, I pronounce them doubtful; I do not affirm that they are clearly false.&#160; But this I say freely&#8212;and I think none of the faithful will deny it&#8212;that, whether these stories be true or inventions, the sacred nativity of St. Mary was preceded by great miracles, and succeeded by the greatest; and so by those who believe that God can do these things, they can be believed and read without damaging their faith or imperilling their souls.&#160; In short, so far as I can, following the sense rather than the words of the writer, and sometimes walking in the same path, though not in the same footsteps, sometimes digressing a little, but still keeping the same road, I shall in this way keep by the style of the narrative, and shall say nothing that is not either written there, or might, following the same train of thought, have been written.</p>
