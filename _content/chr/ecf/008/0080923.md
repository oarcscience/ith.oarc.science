id="vi.iv.xiii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Gods of the
Egyptians.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.xvi-p2"></span>“Therefore you ringleaders among the
Egyptians, boasting of meteorology, and promising to judge the natures
of the stars, by reason of the evil opinion lurking in them, subjected
that name to all manner of dishonour as far as in them lay.  For some of
them taught the worship of an ox called Apis, some that of a he-goat,
some of a cat, some of a serpent; yea, even of a fish, and of onions,
and rumblings in the stomach, <span id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124)
and common sewers, and members of irrational animals, and to myriads of
other base abominations *they gave the name of god*.”
