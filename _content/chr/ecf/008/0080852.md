id="vi.iv.x.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Two Paths.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.x.vii-p2"></span>“Knowing, then, these good and evil
deeds, I make known unto you as it were two paths, <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1083](#fn_1082) and I shall show you by which
travellers are lost and by which they are saved, being guided of God. 
The path of the lost, then, is broad and very smooth—it ruins them
without troubling them; but the path of the saved is narrow, rugged, and
in the end it saves, not without much toil, those who have journeyed
through it.  And these two paths are presided over by unbelief and
faith; and these journey through the path of unbelief, those who have
preferred pleasure, on account of which they have forgotten the day of
judgment, doing that which is not pleasing to God, and not caring to
save their souls by the word, and have not anxiously sought their own
good.  Truly they know not that the counsels of God are not like men’s
counsels; for, in the first place, He knows the thoughts of all men, and
all must give an account not only of their actions, but also of their
thoughts.  And their sin is much less who strive to understand well and
fall, than that of those who do not at all strive after good things. 
Because it has pleased God that he who errs in his knowledge of good, as
men count errors, should be saved after being slightly punished.  But
they who have taken no care at all to know the better way, even though
they may have done countless other good deeds, if they have not stood in
the service He has Himself appointed, come under the charge of
indifference, and are severely punished, and utterly destroyed.
