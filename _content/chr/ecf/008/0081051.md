id="vi.iv.xviii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Exposition of the True
Religion Promised.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.xi-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “Since, then, you
are eager henceforth to learn what relates to our religion, I ought to
explain it in order, beginning with God Himself, and showing that we
ought to call Him alone God, and that we neither ought to speak of the
others as gods nor deem them such, and that he who acts contrary to this
will be punished eternally, as having shown the greatest impiety to Him
who is the Lord of all.”  And saying this, he laid his hands on those
who were vexed by afflictions, and were diseased, and possessed by
demons; and, praying, he healed them, and dismissed the multitudes.  And
then entering in this way, he partook of his usual food, and went to
sleep.
