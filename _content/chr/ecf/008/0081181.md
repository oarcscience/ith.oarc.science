id="vii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 3.</span>

<span id="vii.v.iv-p2"></span>At the same time there appeared a young
man on the mountains to Joachim while he was feeding his flocks, and
said to him:  Why dost thou not return to thy wife?  And Joachim said: 
I have had her for twenty years, and it has not been the will of God to
give me children by her.  I have been driven with shame and reproach
from the temple of the Lord:  why should I go back to her, when I have
been once cast off and utterly despised?  Here then will I remain with
my sheep; and so long as in this life God is willing to grant me light,
I shall willingly, by the hands of my servants, bestow their portions
upon the poor, and the orphans, and those that fear God.  And when he
had thus spoken, the young man said to him:  I am an angel of the Lord,
and I have to-day appeared to thy wife when she was weeping and praying,
and have consoled her; and know that she has conceived a daughter from
thy seed, and thou in thy ignorance of this hast left her.  She will be
in the temple of God, and the Holy Spirit shall abide in her; and her
blessedness shall be greater than that of all the holy women, so that no
one can say that any before her has been like her, or that any after her
in this world will be so.  Therefore go down from the mountains, and
return to thy wife, whom thou wilt find with child.  For God hath raised
up seed in her, and for this thou wilt give God thanks; and her seed
shall be blessed, and she herself shall be blessed, and shall be made
the mother of eternal blessing.  Then Joachim adored the angel, and said
to him:  If I have found favour in thy sight, sit for a little in my
tent, and bless thy servant. <span id="fr_1620"></span>[1621](#fn_1620)
  And the angel said to him:  Do not say servant, but fellow-servant;
for we are the servants of one Master. <span
id="fr_1621"></span>[1622](#fn_1621)   But my food is invisible, and my
drink cannot be seen by a mortal.  Therefore thou oughtest not to ask me
to enter thy tent; but if thou wast about to give me anything, <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1623](#fn_1622) offer it as a burnt-offering to the
Lord.  Then Joachim took a lamb without spot, and said to the angel:  I
should not have dared to offer a burnt-offering to the Lord, unless thy
command had given me the priest’s right of offering. <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[1624](#fn_1623)   And the angel said to him:  I
should not have invited thee to offer unless I had known the will of the
Lord.  And when Joachim was offering the sacrifice to God, the angel and
the odour of the sacrifice went together straight up to heaven with the
smoke. <span id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624)

<span id="vii.v.iv-p8"></span>Then Joachim, throwing himself on his
face, lay in prayer from the sixth hour of the day even until evening. 
And his lads and hired servants who were with him saw him, and not
knowing why he was lying down, thought that he was dead; and they came
to him, and with difficulty raised him from the ground.  And when he
recounted to them the vision of the angel, they were struck with great
fear and wonder, and advised him to accomplish the vision of the angel
without delay, and to go back with all haste to his wife.  And when
Joachim was turning over in his mind whether he should go back or not,
it happened that he was overpowered by a deep sleep; and, behold, the
angel who had already appeared to him when awake, appeared to him in his
sleep, saying:  I am the angel appointed by God as thy guardian:  go
down with confidence, and return to Anna, because the deeds of mercy
which thou and thy wife Anna have done have been told in the presence of
the Most High; and to you will God give such fruit as no prophet or
saint has ever had from the beginning, or ever will have.  And when
Joachim awoke out of his sleep, he called all his herdsmen to him, and
told them his dream.  And they worshipped the Lord, and said to him: 
See that thou no further despise the words of the angel.  But rise and
let us go hence, and return at a quiet pace, feeding our flocks.

<span id="vii.v.iv-p9"></span>And when, after thirty days occupied in
going back, they were now near at hand, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeared to Anna, who was standing and praying, and said: <span
id="fr_1625"></span>[1626](#fn_1625)   Go to the gate which is called
Golden, <span id="fr_1626"></span>[1627](#fn_1626) and meet thy husband
in the way, for to-day he will come to thee.  She therefore went towards
him in haste with her maidens, and, praying to the Lord, she stood a
long time in the gate waiting for him.  And when she was wearied with
long waiting, she lifted up her eyes and saw Joachim afar off coming
with his flocks; and she ran to him and hung on his neck, giving thanks
to God, and saying:  I was a widow, and behold now I am not so:  I was
barren, and behold I have now conceived.  And so they worshipped the
Lord, and went into their own house.  And when this was heard of, there
was great joy among all their neighbours and acquaintances, so that the
whole land of Israel congratulated them.
