Mission.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.iii-p2"></span>“Therefore our lord Peter, having
learned these things, has sent us to be investigators of the things that
have been told him; that if they be so, we may write to him and let him
know, so that he may come and convict him face to face of the
accusations that he has uttered against him.  Since, therefore, danger
on the part of many souls lies before us, on this account we must
neglect bodily rest for a short time; and we would learn truly from you
who live here, whether the things which we have heard be true.  Now tell
us particularly.”
