id="vii.xvii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter 4 (20).</span>

<span id="vii.xvii.iv-p2"></span>And the saints of God heard the
wrangling of Satan and Hades.  They, however, though as yet not at all
recognising each other, were, notwithstanding, in the possession of
their faculties.  But our holy father Adam thus replied to Satan at
once:  O captain of death, why dost thou fear and tremble?  Behold, the
Lord is coming, who will now destroy all thy inventions; and thou shalt
be taken by Him, and bound throughout eternity.

<span id="vii.xvii.iv-p3"></span>Then all the saints, hearing the voice
of our father Adam, how boldly he replied to Satan in all points, were
strengthened in joy; and all running together to father Adam, were
crowded in one place.  Then our father Adam, gazing on all that
multitude, wondered greatly whether all of them had been begotten from
him into the world.  And embracing those who were standing everywhere
around him, and shedding most bitter tears, he addressed his son Seth,
saying:  Relate, my son Seth, to the holy patriarchs and prophets what
the guardian of paradise said to thee, when I sent thee to bring to me
of that oil of compassion, in order to anoint my body when I was ill.

<span id="vii.xvii.iv-p4"></span>Then he answered:  I, when thou sentest
me before the gates of paradise, prayed and entreated the Lord with
tears, and called upon the guardian of paradise to give me of it
therefrom.  Then Michael the archangel came out, and said to me, Seth,
why then dost thou weep?  Know, being informed beforehand, that thy
father Adam will not receive of this oil of compassion now, but after
many generations of time.  For the most beloved Son of God will come
down from heaven into the world, and will be baptized by John in the
river Jordan; and then shall thy father Adam receive of this oil <span
id="fr_2007"></span>[2008](#fn_2007) of compassion, and all that believe
in him.  And of those who have believed in him, their kingdom will
endure for ever.

misprint for *oleo*, oil.
