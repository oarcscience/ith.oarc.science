<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lv-p2"></A>&#8220;Be not, my brethren, distressed by those things that have been done, but give heed to the future:&#160; for what is passed is ended; but the things which threaten are dangerous to those who shall fall in with them.&#160; For offences shall never be wanting in this world,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_710"></A><A HREF="#fn_710"><FONT SIZE="1">711</FONT></A>
 so long as the enemy is permitted to act according to his will; in order that the prudent and those who understood his wiles may be conquerors in the contests which he raises against them; but that those who neglect to learn the things that pertain to the salvation of their souls, may be taken by him with merited deceptions.&#160; Since, therefore, as you have heard, Simon has gone forth to preoccupy the ears of the Gentiles who are called to salvation, it is necessary that I also follow upon his track, so that whatever disputations he raises may be corrected by us.&#160; But inasmuch as it is right that greater anxiety should be felt concerning you who are already received within the walls of life,&#8212;for if that which has been actually acquired perish, a positive loss is sustained; while with respect to that which has not yet been acquired, if it can be got, there is so much gain; but if not, the only loss is that there is no gain;&#8212;in order, therefore, that you may be more and more confirmed in the truth, and the nations who are called to salvation may in no way be prevented by the wickedness of Simon, I have thought good to ordain Zacch&aelig;us as pastor over you,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_711"></A><A HREF="#fn_711"><FONT SIZE="1">712</FONT></A>
 and to remain with you myself for three months; and so to go to the Gentiles, lest through our delaying longer, and the crimes of Simon stalking in every direction, they should become incurable.&#8221;</p>
