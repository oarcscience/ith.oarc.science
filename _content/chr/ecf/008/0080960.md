id="vi.iv.xiv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Baptism.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxvi-p2"></span>“But perhaps some one will say, What
does it contribute to piety to be baptized with water?  In the first
place, because you do that which is pleasing to God; and in the second
place, being born again to God of water, by reason of fear you change
your first generation, which is of lust, and thus you are able to obtain
salvation.  But otherwise it is impossible.  For thus the prophet has
sworn to us, saying, “Verily I say to you, Unless ye be regenerated by
living water into the name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, you shall
not enter the kingdom of heaven.” <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133)   Wherefore approach.  For there is
there something that is merciful from the beginning, borne upon the
water, and rescues from the future punishment those who are baptized
with the thrice blessed invocation, offering as gifts to God the good
deeds of the baptized whenever they are done after their baptism. 
Wherefore flee to the waters, for this alone can quench the violence of
fires. <span id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134)   He who will not now
come to it still bears the spirit of strife, on account of which he will
not approach the living water for his own salvation.
