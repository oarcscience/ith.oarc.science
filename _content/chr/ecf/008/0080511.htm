<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.iii-p2"></A>And when we had commended his right counsel, I Clement said:&#160; &#8220;In all things, the end for the most part looks back upon the beginning, and the issue of things is similar to their commencement.&#160; I hope, therefore, with respect to our father also, since God by your means has given a good beginning, that He will bestow also an ending suitable to the beginning, and worthy of Himself.&#160; However, I make this suggestion, that if, as you have said, we begin to speak, in presence of my father, as if for the purpose of discussing some subject, or learning something from one another, you, my lord Peter, ought not to occupy the place of one who has anything to learn; for if he see this, he will rather be offended.&#160; For he is convinced that you fully know all things, as indeed you do.&#160; How then will it be, if he see you pretending ignorance?&#160; This, as I have said, will rather hurt him, being ignorant of your design.&#160; But if we brothers, while we converse among ourselves, are in any doubt, let a fitting solution be given by you to our inquiry.&#160; For if he see even you hesitating and doubting, then truly he will think that no one has knowledge of the truth.&#8221;</p>
