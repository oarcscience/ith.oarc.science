<span id="vi.iii.xii.i-p3"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iii.xii.i-p3.1"></span>But</span> in the morning, after sunrise,
I Clement, and Niceta and Aquila, along with Peter, came to the
apartment in which my father and mother were sleeping; and finding them
still asleep, we sat down before the door, when Peter addressed us in
such terms as these: <span id="fr_856"></span>[857](#fn_856)   “Listen
to me, most beloved fellow-servants:  I know that you have a great
affection for your father; therefore I am afraid that you will urge him
too soon to take upon himself the yoke of religion, while he is not yet
prepared for it; and to this he may perhaps consent, through his
affection for you.  But this is not to be depended on; for what is done
for the sake of men is not worthy of approbation, and soon falls to
pieces.  Therefore it seems to me, that you should permit him to live
for a year according to his own judgment; and during that time he may
travel with us, and while we are instructing others he may hear with
simplicity; and as he hears, if he has any right purpose of
acknowledging the truth, he will himself request that he may take up the
yoke of religion; or if he do not please to take it, he may remain a
friend.  For those who do not take it up heartily, when they begin not
to be able to bear it, not only cast off that which they had taken up,
but by way of excuse, as it were, for their weakness, they begin to
speak evil of the way of religion, and to malign those whom they have
not been able to follow or to imitate.”

<span id="vi.iii.xii.i-p4"></span> \[In book x. the arrangement, to the
close of chap. 51, differs from that of the *Homilies*.  Here Peter
proposes a delay.  In Homily XV. an account is given of the attempt to
convert the father immediately; the Apostle arguing with him, and urging
the importance of being of the same mind with his family.  Then in
Homilies XVI.–XIX. a second discussion with Simon is given, occurring in
the presence of the father of Clement.  Here the argument is carried on
by Clement (chaps. 7–28), Niceta (chaps. 30–34, 41), Aquila (chaps.
35–38), and concluded by Peter himself (chaps. 42–51).  Much of the
mythological matter finds a parallel in the discussion with Appion
(Homily IV.–VI.), but there is no direct agreement in the two works from
this point to chap. 52.  Comp. Homily XX. <span class="c9"><span
