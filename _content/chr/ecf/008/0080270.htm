<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.lx-p2"></A>Therefore, on the day appointed, when they had ranged themselves before Peter, they said:&#160; &#8220;Do not think, O Peter, that it is a small grief to us that we are to be deprived of the privilege of hearing you for three months; but since it is <A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.v.lx-Page_133"></A>good for us to do what you order, we shall most readily obey.&#160; We shall always retain in our hearts the remembrance of your face; and so we set out actively, as you have commanded us.&#8221;&#160; Then he, having poured out a prayer to the Lord for them, dismissed them.&#160; And when those twelve who had been sent forward had gone, Peter entered, according to custom, and stood in the place of disputation.&#160; And a multitude of people had come together, even a larger number than usual; and all with tears gazed upon him, by reason of what they had heard from him the day before, that he was about to go forth on account of Simon.&#160; Then, seeing them weeping, he himself also was similarly affected, although he endeavoured to conceal and to restrain his tears.&#160; But the trembling of his voice, and the interruption of his discourse, betrayed that he was distressed by similar emotion.</p>
