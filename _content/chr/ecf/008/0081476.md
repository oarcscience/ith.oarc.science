<span id="ix.xiii.vi-p3"></span>Abgar’s letter to the Saviour Jesus
Christ.

<span id="ix.xiii.vi-p4"></span>“Abgar, son of Archam, prince of the
land, to Jesus, Saviour and Benefactor of men, who has appeared in the
country of Jerusalem, greeting:—

<span id="ix.xiii.vi-p5"></span>“I have heard of Thee, and of the cures
wrought by Thy hands, without remedies, without herbs:  for, as it is
said, Thou makest the blind to see, the lame to walk, the lepers to be
healed; Thou drivest out unclean spirits, Thou curest unhappy beings
afflicted with prolonged and inveterate diseases; Thou dost even raise
the dead.  As I have heard of all these wonders wrought by Thee, I have
concluded from them either that Thou art God, come down from heaven to
do such great things, or that Thou art the Son of God, working as Thou
dost these miracles.  Therefore have I written to Thee, praying Thee to
condescend to come to me and cure me of the complaints with which I am
afflicted.  I have heard also that the Jews murmur against Thee and wish
to deliver Thee up to torments:  I have a city small but pleasant, it
would be sufficient for us both.”

<span id="ix.xiii.vi-p6"></span>The messengers, the bearers of this
letter, met Jesus at Jerusalem, a fact confirmed by these words of the
Gospel:  “Some from amongst the heathen came to find Jesus, but those
who heard them, not daring to tell Jesus what they had heard, told it to
Philip and Andrew, who repeated it all to their Master.”

<span id="ix.xiii.vi-p7"></span>The Saviour did not then accept the
invitation given to Him, but He thought fit to honour Abgar with an
answer in these words:—
