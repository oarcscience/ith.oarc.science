Righteousness.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xx-p2"></span>“Peace be to all of you who are
prepared to give your right hands to truth: <span
id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613)   for whosoever are obedient to it
seem indeed themselves to confer some favour upon God; whereas they do
themselves obtain from Him the gift of His greatest bounty, walking in
His paths of righteousness.  Wherefore the first duty of all is to
inquire into the righteousness of God and His kingdom; <span
id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614) His righteousness, that we may be
taught to act rightly; His kingdom, that we may know what is the reward
appointed for labour and patience; in which kingdom there is indeed a
bestowal of eternal good things upon the good, but upon those who have
acted contrary to the will of God, a worthy infliction of penalties in
proportion to the doings of every one.  It becomes you, therefore,
whilst you are here,—that is, whilst you are in the present life,—to
ascertain the will of God, while there is opportunity also of doing it. 
For if any one, before he amends his doings, wishes to investigate
concerning things which he cannot discover, such investigation will be
foolish and ineffectual.  For the time is short, and the judgment of God
shall be occupied with deeds, not questions.  Therefore before all
things let us inquire into this, what or in what manner we must act that
we may merit to obtain eternal life.

*Homilies*, but in other parts the discourses differ.  This is far more
dignified and consistent than that in the *Homilies*, which at once
introduces a claim to authority as messenger of the Prophet.—R.\]
