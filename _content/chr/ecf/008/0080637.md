<span id="vi.iv.v.iv-p2"></span>“However, I have learned, O Clement, how
that in Alexandria Barnabas perfectly expounded to you the word
respecting prophecy.  Was it not so?”  I answered, “Yes, and exceeding
well.”  Then Peter:  “Therefore it is not necessary now to occupy with
the instructions which you know, the time which may serve us for other
instructions which you do not know.”  Then said I:  “You have rightly
said, O Peter.  But vouchsafe this to me, who purpose always to attend
upon you, continuously to expound to me, a delighted hearer, the
doctrine of the Prophet.  For, apart from Him, as I learned from
Barnabas, it is impossible to learn the truth.”
