Conference.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.lxii-p2"></span>“And, therefore, since amongst these
*philosophers* are things uncertain, we must come to the true Prophet. 
Him God the Father wished to be loved by all, and accordingly He has
been pleased wholly to extinguish those opinions which have originated
with men, and in regard to which there is nothing like certainty—that He
*the true Prophet* might be the more sought after, and that He
whom <span id="fr_832"></span>[833](#fn_832) they had obscured should
show to men the way of truth.  For on this account also God made the
world, and by Him the world is filled; whence also He is everywhere near
to them who seek Him, though He be sought in the remotest ends of the
earth.  But if any one seek Him not purely, nor holily, nor faithfully,
He is indeed within him, because He is everywhere, and is found within
the minds of all men; but, as we have said before, He is dormant to the
unbelieving, and is held to be absent from those by whom His existence
is not believed.”  And when Peter had said this, and more to the same
effect, concerning the true Prophet, he dismissed the crowds; and when
he very earnestly entreated the old man to remain with us, he could
prevail nothing; but he also departed, to return next day, as had been
agreed upon.  And after this, we also, with Peter, went to our lodging,
and enjoyed our accustomed food and rest.

*quem*, the sense would be:  that He might lay open to men the way of
truth which they had blocked up.  So Whiston.
