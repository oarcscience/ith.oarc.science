<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xx.xv-p2"></A>And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;If you maintain that apparitions do not always reveal the truth, yet for all that, visions and dreams, being God-sent, do not speak falsely in regard to those matters which they wish to tell.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;You were right in saying that, being God-sent, they do not speak falsely.&#160; But it is uncertain if he who sees has seen a God-sent dream.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;If he who has had the vision is just, he has seen a true vision.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;You were right.&#160; But who is just, if he stands in need of a vision that he may learn what he ought to learn, and do what he ought to do?&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Grant me this, that the just man alone can see a true vision, and I shall then reply to that other point.&#160; For I have come to the conclusion that an impious man does not see a true dream.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;This is false; and I can prove it both apart from Scripture and by Scripture; but I do not undertake to persuade you.&#160; For the man who is inclined to fall in love with a bad woman, does not change his mind so as to care for a lawful union with another woman in every respect good; but sometimes they love the worse woman through prepossessions, though they are conscious that there is another who is more excellent.&#160; And you are ignorant, in consequence of some such state of mind.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Dismiss this subject, and discuss the matter on which you promised to speak.&#160; For it seems to me impossible that impious men should receive dreams from God in any way whatever.&#8221;</p>
