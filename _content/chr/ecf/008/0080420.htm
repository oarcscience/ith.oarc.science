<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xiv-p2"></A>&#8220;And, indeed, I know that several of the philosophers were rather of this opinion, that God the Creator made divisions and distinctions from one body, which they call <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.x.xiv-p2.1"></A>Matter</span>, which yet consisted of four elements, mingled into one by a certain tempering of divine providence.&#160; For I think that what some have said is vain, that the body of the world is simple, that is, without any conjunction; since it is evident that what is simple can neither be a body, nor can be mixed, or propagated, or dissolved; all which, we see, happen to the bodies of the world.&#160; For how could it be dissolved if it were simple, and had not within it that from which it might be resolved and divided?&#160; But if bodies seem to be composed of two, or three, or even of four elements,&#8212;who that has even a small portion of sense does not perceive that there must have been some one who collected several into one, and preserving the measure of tempering, made a solid body out of diverse parts?&#160; This <i>some one,</i> therefore, we call God, the Creator of the world, and acknowledge Him as the author of the universe.</p>
