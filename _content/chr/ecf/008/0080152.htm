<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xv-p2"></A>&#8220;As we spoke these and such like words with looks suited to the occasion, this most vain fellow believed that we were deceived; and being thereby the more elated, he added also this:&#160; &#145;I shall now be propitious to you, for the affection which you bear towards me as God; for you loved me while you did not know me, and were seeking me in ignorance.&#160; But I would not have you doubt that this is truly to be God, when one is able to become small or great as he pleases; for I am able to appear to man in whatever manner I please.&#160; Now, then, I shall begin to unfold to you what is true.&#160; Once on a time, I, by my power, turning air into water, and water again into blood, and solidifying it into flesh, formed a new human creature&#8212;a boy&#8212;and produced a much nobler work than God the Creator.&#160; For He created a man from the earth, but I from air&#8212;a far more difficult matter; and again I unmade him and restored him to air, but not until I had placed his picture and image in my bed-chamber, as a proof and memorial of my work.&#146;&#160; Then we understood that he spake concerning that boy, whose soul, after he had been slain by violence, he made use of for those services which he required.&#8221;</p>
