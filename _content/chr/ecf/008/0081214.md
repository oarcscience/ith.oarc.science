<span id="vii.v.xxxvii-p2"></span>After these things Jesus crossed the
Jordan, in the sight of them all, with the lions; and the water of the
Jordan was divided on the right hand and on the left. <span
id="fr_1680"></span>[1681](#fn_1680)   Then He said to the lions, in the
hearing of all:  Go in peace, and hurt no one; but neither let man
injure you, until you return to the place whence you have come forth. 
And they, bidding Him farewell, not only with their gestures but with
their voices, went to their own place.  But Jesus returned to His
mother.
