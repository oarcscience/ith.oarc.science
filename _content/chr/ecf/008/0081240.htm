<p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.v-p2"></A>And a few days after, as Jesus was walking through the town with Joseph, one of the children ran up and struck Jesus on the arm.&#160; And Jesus said to him:&#160; So shalt thou not finish thy journey.&#160; And immediately he fell to the ground, and died.&#160; And those who saw these wonderful things cried out, saying:&#160; Whence is that boy?&#160; And they said to Joseph:&#160; It is not right for such a boy to be among us.&#160; And Joseph went and brought Him.&#160; And they said to him:&#160; Go away from this place; but if thou must live with us, teach him to pray, and not to blaspheme:&#160; but our children have been killed.&#160; Joseph called Jesus, and reproved Him, saying:&#160; Why dost thou blaspheme?&#160; For these people who live here hate us.&#160; And Jesus said:&#160; I know that these words are not mine, but thine; but I will hold my tongue for thy sake:&#160; and let them see to it in their wisdom.&#160; And immediately those who were speaking against Jesus became blind.&#160; And they walked up and down, and said:&#160; All the words which proceed from his mouth are accomplished.&#160; And Joseph seeing what Jesus had done, in a fury seized Him by the ear; and Jesus said to Joseph in anger:&#160; It is enough for thee to see me, not to touch me.&#160; For thou knowest not who I am; but if thou didst know, thou wouldst not make me angry.&#160; And although just now I am with thee, I was made before thee.</p>
