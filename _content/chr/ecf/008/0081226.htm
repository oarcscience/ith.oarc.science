<p class="c21"><a name="vii.vi.v-p2"></A>Therefore, as the angel had commanded, both of them setting out from the place where they were, went up to Jerusalem; and when they had come to the place pointed out by the angel&#146;s prophecy, there they met each other.&#160; Then, rejoicing at seeing each other, and secure in the certainty of the promised offspring, they gave the thanks due to the Lord, who exalteth the humble.&#160; And so, having worshipped the Lord, they returned home, and awaited in certainty and in gladness the divine promise.&#160; Anna therefore conceived, and brought forth a daughter; and according to the command of the angel, her parents called her name Mary.</p>
