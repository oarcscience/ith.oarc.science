<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.iv-p2"></A>While Peter spoke these words, and others to the same effect, Simon answered:&#160; &#8220;I will not have you detain me with long speeches, Peter; I claim from you what you promised yesterday.&#160; You then said that you could show that the law teaches concerning the immensity of the eternal light, and that there are only two heavens, and these created, and that the higher is the abode of that light, in which the ineffable Father dwells alone for ever; but that after the pattern of that heaven is made this visible heaven, which you asserted is to pass away.&#160; You said, therefore, that the Father of all is one, because there cannot be two infinites; else neither of them would be infinite, because in that in which the one subsists, he makes a limit of the subsistence of the other.&#160; Since then you not only promised this, but are able to show it from the law, leave off other matters and set about this.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;If I were asked to speak of these things only on your account, who come only for the purpose of contradicting, you should never hear a single discourse from me; but seeing it is necessary that the husbandman, wishing to sow good ground, should sow some seeds, either in stony places, or places that are to be trodden of men, or in places filled with brambles and briers (as our Master also set forth, indicating by these the diversities of the purposes of several souls),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_678"></A><A HREF="#fn_678"><FONT SIZE="1">679</FONT></A>
