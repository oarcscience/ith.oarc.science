<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.xiii-p2"></A>And the Jews, hearing that Joseph had begged the body of Jesus, sought for him; and those twelve men who had said that He was not born of fornication, and Nicodemus, and many others, who had stood before Pilate and declared His good works.&#160; And all of them being hid, Nicodemus alone appeared to them, because he was a chief man of the Jews; and he says to them:&#160; How have ye come into the synagogue?&#160; The Jews say to him:&#160; And thou, how hast thou come into the synagogue, seeing that thou consentest with him?&#160; May his portion be with thee in the world to come!&#160; Nicodemus said:&#160; Amen, amen, amen.&#160; Likewise also Joseph, coming forth, said to them:&#160; Why are you enraged against me because I begged the body of Jesus?&#160; Lo, I have laid him in my own new <A NAME="page_444"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 444</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xv.xiii-Page_444"></A>tomb, wrapping him in clean linen; and I have rolled a stone to the door of the cave.&#160; And ye have not acted well against a just man, since you have not borne in mind how you crucified him, and pierced him with a lance.&#160; The Jews therefore, laying hold of Joseph, ordered him to be imprisoned because of the Sabbath-day; and they say to him:&#160; Know that the hour compels us not to do anything against thee, because the Sabbath is dawning.&#160; But understand that thou art worthy not even of burial, but we will give thy flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.&#160; Joseph says to them:&#160; That is the speech of proud Goliath, who reviled the living God against holy David.&#160; And God hath said, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.&#160; And Pilate, intercepted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1963"></A><A HREF="#fn_1963"><FONT SIZE="1">1964</FONT></A>
 in his heart, took water, and washed his hands before the sun, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just man; see ye to it.&#160; And you answered and said to Pilate, His blood be upon us, and upon our children.&#160; And now I fear that some time or other the wrath of God will come upon you and your children, as you have said.&#160; And the Jews, hearing this, were embittered in heart; and taking Joseph, shut him up in a house where there was no window, and set guards at the gates, and sealed the gate where Joseph had been shut up.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.xiii-p4"></A>And on the Sabbath morning they took counsel with the priests and the Levites, that they should all be assembled after the Sabbath-day.&#160; And awaking at dawn, all the multitude in the synagogue took counsel by what death they should slay him.&#160; And when the assembly was sitting, they ordered him to be brought with much indignity; and opening the gate, they found him not.&#160; All the people therefore were in terror, and wondered with exceeding astonishment, because they found the seals sealed, and because Caiaphas had the keys.&#160; And no longer did they dare to lay hand upon those who spoke before Pilate in Jesus&#146; defence.</p>
