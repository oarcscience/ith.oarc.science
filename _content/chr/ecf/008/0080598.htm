<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.ix-p2"></A>&#8220;But I know that ye will do these things if you fix love into your minds; and for its entrance there is one only fit means, viz., the common partaking of food.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">896</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore see to it that ye be frequently one another&#146;s guests, as ye are able, that you may not fail of it.&#160; For it is the cause of well-doing, and well-doing of salvation.&#160; Therefore all of you present your provisions in common to all your brethren in God, knowing that, giving temporal things, you shall receive eternal things.&#160; Much more feed the hungry, and give drink to the thirsty, and clothing to the naked; visit the sick; showing yourselves to those who are in prison, help them as ye are able, and receive strangers into your houses with all alacrity.&#160; However, not to speak in detail, philanthropy will teach you to do everything that is good, as misanthropy suggests ill-doing to those who will not be saved.</p>
