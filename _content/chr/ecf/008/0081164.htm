<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxiii.xix-p2"></A>&#8220;When <i>you are</i> with these in Antioch, while you look like Simon, proclaim publicly your <i>repentance</i>, saying, &#145;I Simon proclaim this to you:&#160; I confess&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1534"></A><A HREF="#fn_1534"><FONT SIZE="1">1535</FONT></A>
 that all my statements in regard to Peter are <i>utterly false;</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1535"></A><A HREF="#fn_1535"><FONT SIZE="1">1536</FONT></A>
<i>for he is not</i> a deceiver, nor a murderer, nor a juggler; nor are any of the evil things true which I, urged on by wrath, said previously in regard to him.&#160; I myself therefore beg of you, I who have been the cause of your hatred to him, cease from hating him; for he is the true apostle of the true Prophet that was sent by God for the salvation of the world.&#160; Wherefore also I counsel you to believe what he preaches;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1536"></A><A HREF="#fn_1536"><FONT SIZE="1">1537</FONT></A>
 for if you do not, your whole city will be utterly destroyed.&#160; Now I wish you to know for what reason I have made this confession to you.&#160; This night angels of God scourged me, the impious one, terribly, as being an enemy to the herald of the truth.&#160; I beseech you, therefore, do not listen to me, even if I myself should come at another time and attempt to say anything against Peter.&#160; For I confess to you I am a magician, I am a deceiver, I am a juggler.&#160; Yet perhaps it is possible for me by repentance to wipe out the sins which were formerly committed by me.&#146;&#8221;</p>
