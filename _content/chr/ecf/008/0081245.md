<span id="vii.x.x-p2"></span>In the time of sowing, Joseph went out to
sow wheat, and Jesus followed him.  And when Joseph began to sow, Jesus
stretched out His hand, and took as much wheat as He could hold in His
fist, and scattered it.  Joseph therefore came at reaping-time to reap
his harvest.  Jesus came also, and collected the ears which He had
scattered, and they made a hundred pecks <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[1769](#fn_1768) of the best grain; and he called
the poor, and the widows, and the orphans, and distributed to them the
wheat which He had made.  Joseph also took a little of the same wheat,
for the blessing of Jesus to his house.
