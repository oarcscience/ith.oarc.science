id="vi.iv.xiv.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—Outward and Inward
Purity.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xxix-p2"></span>“Therefore He made use of this
memorable expression, speaking the truth with respect to the hypocrites
of them, not with respect to all.  For to some He said that obedience
was to be rendered, because they were entrusted with the chair of
Moses.  However, to the hypocrites he said, ‘Woe to you, Scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye make clean the outside of the cup and the
platter, but the inside is full of filth.  Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse
first the inside of the cup and the platter, that their outsides may be
clean also.’  And truly:  for when the mind is enlightened by knowledge,
the disciple is able to be good, and thereupon purity follows; for from
the understanding within a good care of the body without is produced. 
As from negligence with respect to the body, care of the understanding
cannot be produced, so the pure man can purify both that which is
without and that which is within.  And he who, purifying the things
without, does it looking to the praise of men, and by the praise of
those who look on, he has nothing from God.
