<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lxxiv-p2"></A>&#8220;When Zacch&aelig;us had heard these things, he told me in return of the doings of Simon; and in the meantime Simon himself&#8212;how he heard of my arrival I do not know&#8212;sent a message to me, saying, &#145;Let us dispute to-morrow in the hearing of the people.&#146;&#160; To which I answered, &#145;Be it so, as it pleaseth you.&#146;&#160; And this promise of mine was known over the whole city, so that even you, who arrived on that very day, learned that I was to hold a discussion with Simon on the following day, and having found out my abode, according to the directions which you had received from Barnabas, came to me.&#160; But I so rejoiced at your coming, that my mind, moved I know not how, hastened to expound all things quickly to you, yet especially that which is the main point in our faith, concerning the true Prophet, which alone, I doubt not, is a sufficient foundation for the whole of our doctrine.&#160; Then, in the next place, I unfolded to you the more secret meaning of the written law, through its several heads, which there was occasion to unfold; neither did I conceal from you the good things of the traditions.&#160; But what remains, beginning from tomorrow, you shall hear from day to day in connection with the questions which will be raised in the discussion with Simon, <A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iii.lxxiv-Page_97"></A>until by God&#146;s favour we reach that city of Rome to which we believe that our journey is to be directed.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lxxiv-p3"></A>I then declared that I owed him all thanks for what he had told me, and promised that I would most readily do all that he commanded.&#160; Then, having taken food, he ordered me to rest, and he also betook himself to rest.&#8221;</p>
