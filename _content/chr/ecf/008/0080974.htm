<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.iii-p2"></A>When Peter had thus spoken they were compelled to acquiesce, saying, &#8220;It does not altogether grieve us, my lord, to do this on account of its being your command; in the first place, indeed, because you have been chosen by the providence of God, as being worthy to think and counsel well in all things; and in addition to this, for the most part we shall be separated from you only for two days by the necessity of preceding you.&#160; And that were indeed a long time to be without sight of thee, O Peter, did we not consider that they will be more grieved who are sent much farther forward, being ordered to wait for thee longer in every city, distressed that they are longer deprived of the sight of thy longed-for countenance.&#160; And we, though not less distressed than they, make no opposition, because you order us to do it for profit.&#8221;&#160; Thus, having spoken, they went forward, having it in charge that at the first stage they should address the accompanying multitude that they should enter the cities apart from one another.</p>
