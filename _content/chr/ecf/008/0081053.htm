(comp. Homily III.), but all the circumstances are different.&#160; Uhlhorn formerly regarded this portion of the <i>Homilies</i> as the nucleus of the entire literature.&#160; He has modified his view.&#160; An analysis of the discussion cannot be attempted; but in the footnote to <i>Recognitions</i>, ii. 19, a general comparison is given of the three accounts of discussions with Simon Magus.&#8212;R.]</p>
