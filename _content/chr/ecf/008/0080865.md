id="vi.iv.xi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Moses and Christ.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.vii-p2"></span>“Neither, therefore, are the Hebrews
condemned on account of their ignorance of Jesus, by reason of Him who
has concealed Him, if, doing the things *commanded* by Moses, they do
not hate Him whom they do not know.  Neither are those from among the
Gentiles condemned, who know not Moses on account of Him who hath
concealed him, provided that these also, doing the things spoken by
Jesus, do not hate Him whom they do not know.  And some will not be
profited by calling the teachers lords, but not doing the works of
servants.  For on this account our Jesus Himself said to one who often
called Him Lord, but did none of the things which He prescribed, ‘Why
call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?’ <span
id="fr_1093"></span>[1094](#fn_1093)   For it is not saying that will
profit any one, but doing.  By all means, therefore, is there need of
good works.  Moreover, if any one has been thought worthy to recognise
both as preaching one doctrine, that man has been counted rich in God,
understanding both the old things as new in time, and the new things as
old.”
