<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.viii-p2"></A>And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Since, at least in appearance, you have confessed that you do not understand it, reply to the question I put to you, and you will learn the meaning of the statement.&#160; Tell me, do you maintain that the Son, whoever he be, is just, or that he is not just?&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;I maintain that he is most just.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Seeing He is just, why does He not make the revelation to all, but only to those to whom He wishes?&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Because, being just, he wishes to make the revelation only to the worthy.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Must He not therefore know the mind of each one, in order that He may make the revelation to the worthy?&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Of course he must.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;With reason, therefore, has the work of giving the revelation been confined to Him alone, for He alone knows the mind of every one; and it has not been given to you, who are not able to understand even that which is stated by us.&#8221;</p>
