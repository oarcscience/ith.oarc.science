<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xxiii.ii-p2"></A>And on the following day, the fourth day of the week, they brought Him at the ninth hour into the hall of Caiaphas.&#160; And Annas and Caiaphas say to Him:&#160; Tell us, why hast thou stolen our law, and renounced&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2035"></A><A HREF="#fn_2035"><FONT SIZE="1">2036</FONT></A>
 the ordinances of Moses and the prophets?&#160; And Jesus answered nothing.&#160; And again a second time, the multitude also being present, they say to Him:&#160; The sanctuary which Solomon built in forty and six years, why dost thou wish to destroy in one moment?&#160; And to these things Jesus answered nothing.&#160; For the sanctuary of the synagogue had been plundered by the robber.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxiii.ii-p4"></A><A NAME="page_469"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 469</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xxiii.ii-Page_469"></A>And the evening of the fourth day being ended, all the multitude sought to burn the daughter of Caiaphas, on account of the loss of the law; for they did not know how they were to keep the passover.&#160; And she said to them: &#160;Wait, my children, and let us destroy this Jesus, and the law will be found, and the holy feast will be fully accomplished.&#160; And secretly Annas and Caiaphas gave considerable money to Judas Iscariot, saying:&#160; Say as thou saidst to us before, I know that the law has been stolen by Jesus, that the accusation may be turned against him, and not against this maiden, who is free from blame.&#160; And Judas having received this command, said to them:&#160; Let not all the multitude know that I have been instructed by you to do this against Jesus; but release Jesus, and I persuade the multitude that it is so.&#160; And craftily they released Jesus.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxiii.ii-p5"></A>And Judas, going into the sanctuary at the dawn of the fifth day, says to all the people:&#160; What will you give me, and I will give up to you the overthrower&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2036"></A><A HREF="#fn_2036"><FONT SIZE="1">2037</FONT></A>
 of the law, and the plunderer of the prophets?&#160; The Jews say to him:&#160; If thou wilt give him up to us, we will give thee thirty pieces of gold.&#160; And the people did not know that Judas was speaking about Jesus, for many of them confessed that he was the Son of God.&#160; And Judas received the thirty pieces of gold.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxiii.ii-p7"></A>And going out at the fourth hour, and at the fifth, he finds Jesus walking in the street.&#160; And as evening was coming on, Judas says to the Jews:&#160; Give me the aid of soldiers with swords and staves, and I will give him up to you.&#160; They therefore gave him officers for the purpose of seizing Him.&#160; And as they were going along, Judas says to them:&#160; Lay hold of the man whom I shall kiss, for he has stolen the law and the prophets.&#160; Going up to Jesus, therefore, he kissed Him, saying:&#160; Hail, Rabbi! it being the evening of the fifth day.&#160; And having laid hold of Him, they gave Him up to Caiaphas and the chief priests, Judas saying:&#160; This is he who stole the law and the prophets.&#160; And the Jews gave Jesus an unjust trial, saying:&#160; Why hast thou done these things?&#160; And he answered nothing.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xxiii.ii-p8"></A>And Nicodemus and I Joseph, seeing the seat of the plagues,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2037"></A><A HREF="#fn_2037"><FONT SIZE="1">2038</FONT></A>
 stood off from them, not wishing to perish along with the counsel of the ungodly.</p>
