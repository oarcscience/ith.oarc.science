<span id="ix.xiii.v-p3"></span>Abgar sends princes to Marinus; these
deputies see our Saviour Christ; beginning of the conversion of Abgar.

<span id="ix.xiii.v-p4"></span>At this period Marinus, son of Storoge,
was raised by the emperor to the government of Phœnicia, Palestine,
Syria, and Mesopotamia.  Abgar sent to him two of his principal
officers, Mar-Ihap prince of Aghtznik, and Chamchacram chief of the
house of the Abahouni, as well as Anan his confidant.  The envoys
proceed to the town of Petkoupine to make known to Marinus the reasons
of Abgar’s journey to the East, showing him the treaty concluded between
Ardachès and his brothers, and at the same time to call upon Marinus for
his support.  The deputies found the Roman governor at Eleutheropolis;
he received them with friendship and distinction, and gave this answer
to Abgar:  “Fear nothing from the emperor on that account, provided you
take good care to pay the tribute regularly.”

<span id="ix.xiii.v-p5"></span>On their return, the Armenian deputies
went to Jerusalem to see our Saviour the Christ, being attracted by the
report of His miracles.  Having themselves become eye-witnesses of these
wonders, they related them to Abgar.  This prince, <span

with admiration, believed truly that Jesus was indeed the Son of God,
and said:  “These wonders are not those of a man, but of a God.  No,
there is no one amongst men who can raise the dead:  God alone has this
power.”  Abgar felt in his whole body certain acute pains which he had
got in Persia, more than seven years before; from men he had received no
remedy for his sufferings; Abgar sent a letter of entreaty to Jesus:  he
prayed Him to come and cure him of his pains.  Here is this letter:—
