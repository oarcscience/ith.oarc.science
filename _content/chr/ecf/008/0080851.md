<span id="vi.iv.x.vi-p2"></span>And as Peter entered Sidon, they brought
many in couches, and laid them before him.  And he said to them:  “Think
not, I pray you, that I can do anything to heal you, who am a mortal
man, myself subject to many evils.  But I shall not refuse to show you
the way in which you must be saved.  For I have learned from the Prophet
of truth the conditions fore-ordained of God before the foundation of
the world; that is to say, the evil deeds which if men do He has
ordained that they shall be injured by the prince of evil, and in like
manner the good deeds for which He has decreed that they who have
believed in Him as their Physician shall have their bodies made whole,
and their souls established in safety.
