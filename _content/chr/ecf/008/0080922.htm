<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiii.xv-p2"></A>&#8220;For if you say that, after the manner of C&aelig;sar, God has subordinate powers&#8212;those, namely, which are called gods&#8212;you do not thus go by your illustration.&#160; For if you went by it, you must of necessity know that it is not lawful to give the name of C&aelig;sar to another, whether he be consul, or prefect, or captain, or any one else, and that he who gives such a name shall not live, and he who takes it shall be cut off.&#160; Thus, according to your own illustration, the name of God must not be given to another; and he who is tempted either to take or give it is destroyed.&#160; Now, if this insult of a man induces punishment, much more they who call others gods shall be subject to eternal punishment, as insulting God.&#160; And with good reason; because you subject to all the insult that you can the name which it was committed to you to honour, in order to His monarchy.&#160; For <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.xiii.xv-p2.1"></A>God</span> is not properly His name; but you having in the meantime received it, insult what has been given you, that it may be accounted as done against the real name, according as you use that.&#160; But you subject it to every kind of insult.</p>
