<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxiii-p2"></A>&#8220;Let us then understand that there are two kinds of prophecy:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_967"></A><A HREF="#fn_967"><FONT SIZE="1">968</FONT></A>
&#160; the one male; and let it be defined that the first, being the male, has been ranked after the other in the order of advent; but the second, being female, has been appointed to come first in the advent of the pairs.&#160; This second, therefore, being amongst those born of woman, as the female superintendent of this present world, wishes to be thought masculine.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_968"></A><A HREF="#fn_968"><FONT SIZE="1">969</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore, stealing the seeds of the male, and sowing them with her own seeds of the flesh, she brings forth the fruits&#8212;that is, words&#8212;as wholly her own.&#160; And she promises that she will give the present earthly riches as a dowry, wishing to change the slow for the swift, the small for the greater.</p>
