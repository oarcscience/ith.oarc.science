id="vi.iv.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Duties of
Catechists.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii.xiii-p2"></span>“Let the catechists instruct, being
first instructed; for it is a work relating to the souls of men.  For
the teacher of the word must accommodate himself to the various
judgments of the learners.  The catechists must therefore be learned,
and unblameable, of much experience, and approved, as you will know that
Clement is, who is to be your instructor after me.  For it were too much
for me now to go into details.  However, if ye be of one mind, you shall
be able to reach the haven of rest, where is the peaceful city of the
great King.
