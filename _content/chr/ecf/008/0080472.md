id="vi.iii.xi.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—Beginning of the
Discussion.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.iii-p2"></span>When the old man had said this, I
Clement began to speak as follows:  “God by His Son created the world as
a double house, separated by the interposition of this firmament, which
is called heaven; and appointed angelic powers to dwell in the higher,
and a multitude of men to be born in this visible world, from amongst
whom He might choose friends for His Son, with whom He might rejoice,
and who might be prepared for Him as a beloved bride for a bridegroom. 
But even till the time of the marriage, which is the manifestation of
the world to come, He has appointed a certain power, to choose out and
watch over the good ones of those who are born in this world, and to
preserve them for His Son, set apart in a certain place of the world,
which is without sin; in which there are already some, who are there
being prepared, as I said, as a bride adorned for the coming of the
bridegroom.  For the prince of this world and of the present age is like
an adulterer, who corrupts and violates the minds of men, and, seducing
them from the love of the true bridegroom, allures them to strange
lovers.
