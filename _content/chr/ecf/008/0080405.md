<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.ix.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII.—Reward of
Chastity.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.xxxviii-p2"></span>Therefore, as the order and
reason of the mystery demanded, on the following day she was baptized in
the sea, <span id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803) and returning to the
lodging, was initiated in all the mysteries of religion in their order. 
And we her sons, Niceta and Aquila, and I Clement, were present.  And
after this we dined with her, and glorified God with her, thankfully
acknowledging the zeal and teaching of Peter, who showed us, by the
example of our mother, that the good of chastity is not lost with
God; <span id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804) “as, on the other hand,”
said he, “unchastity does not escape punishment, though it may not be
punished immediately, but slowly.  But so well pleasing,” said he, “is
chastity to God, that it confers some grace in the present life even
upon those who are in error; for future blessedness is laid up for those
only who preserve chastity and righteousness by the grace of baptism. 
In short, that which has befallen your mother is an example of this, for
all this welfare has been restored to her in reward of her chastity, for
the guarding and preserving of which continence alone is not sufficient;
but when any one perceives that snares and deceptions are being
prepared, he must straightway flee as from the violence of fire or the
attack of a mad dog, and not trust that he can easily frustrate snares
of this kind by philosophizing or by humouring them; but, as I have
said, he must flee and withdraw to a distance, as your mother also did
through her true and entire love of chastity.  And on this account she
has been preserved to you, and you to her; and in addition, she has been
endowed with the knowledge of eternal life.”  When he had said this, and
much more to the same effect, the evening having come, we went to sleep.
