id="vi.iv.xxi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Peter Doubts Simon’s
Honesty.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxi.v-p2"></span>When Simon had made these statements,
Peter said to him:  “Can you call to witness that these are your beliefs
that being Himself,—I do not mean Him whom you speak of now as being
unrevealed, but Him in whom you believe, though you do not confess Him? 
For you are talking nonsense when you define one thing in stead of
another.  Wherefore, if you call Him to witness that you believe what
you say, I shall answer you.  But if you continue discussing with me
what you do not believe, you compel me to strike the empty air.”  And
Simon said:  “It is from some of your own disciples that I have heard
*that this is the truth*.” <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376)  
And Peter said:  “Do not bear false witness?”  And Simon said:  “Do not
rebuke me, most insolent man.”  And Peter said:  “So long as you do not
tell who it was who said so, *I affirm that* you are a liar.”  And Simon
said:  “Suppose that I myself have got up these doctrines, or that I
heard them from some other, give me your answer to them.  For if they
cannot be overturned, then I have learned that this is the truth.”  And
Peter said:  “If it is a human invention, I will not reply to <span
id="page_326">p. 326</span> <span id="vi.iv.xxi.v-Page_326"></span>it;
but if you are held fast by the supposition that it is the truth,
acknowledge to me that this is the case, and I can then myself say
something in regard to the matter.”  And Simon said:  “Once for all,
then, these doctrines seem to me to be true.  Give me your reply, if you
have aught to say against them.”
