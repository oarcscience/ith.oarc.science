id="vi.iii.x.xlix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIX.—God’s Precepts
Despised.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.xlix-p2"></span>“If,” said the old man, “even the
righteous are tormented on account of the iniquities of others, God
ought, as foreseeing this, to have commanded men not to do those things
from which it should be necessary that the righteous be afflicted with
the unrighteous; or if they did them, He ought to have applied some
correction or purification to the world.” <span
id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822)   “God,” said Aquila, “did so command,
and gave precepts by the prophets how men ought to live; but even these
precepts they despised:  yea, if any desired to observe them, them they
afflicted with various injuries, until they drove them from their
purposed observance, and turned them to the rabble of infidelity, and
made them like unto themselves.
