id="vi.iv.xi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—Temptation of Christ.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.xxi-p2"></span>“For once the king of the present time
came to our King of righteousness, using no violence, for this was not
in his power, but inducing and persuading, because the being persuaded
lies in the power of every one. <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[1104](#fn_1103)   Approaching Him, therefore, as
being king of things present, he said to the King of things future, ‘All
the kingdoms of the present world are subject to me; also the gold and
the silver and all the luxury of this world are under my power. 
Wherefore fall down and worship me, and I will give you all these
things.’  And this he said, knowing that after He worshipped him he
would have power also over Him, and thus would rob Him of the future
glory and kingdom.  But He, knowing all things, not only did not worship
him, but would not receive aught of the things that were offered by
him.  For He pledged Himself with those that are His, to the effect that
it is not lawful henceforth even to touch the things that are given over
to him.  Therefore He answered and said, ‘Thou shalt fear the Lord thy
God, and Him only shalt thou serve.’ <span
