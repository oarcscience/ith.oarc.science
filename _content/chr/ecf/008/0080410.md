id="vi.iii.x.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Question Stated.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.iv-p2"></span>Then Peter began to say:  “Those who
speak the word of truth, and who enlighten the souls of men, seem to me
to be like the rays of the sun, which, when once they have come forth
and appeared to the world, can no longer be concealed or hidden, while
they are not so much seen by men, as they afford sight to all. 
Therefore it was well said by One to the heralds of the truth, ‘Ye are
the light of the world, and a city set upon a hill cannot be hid;
neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a
candlestick, that it may enlighten all who are in the house.’ <span
id="fr_808"></span>[809](#fn_808) ”  Then said the old man:  “He said
well, whoever he is.  But let one of you state what, according to his
opinion, ought to be followed, that we may direct our speech to a
definite aim.  For, in order to find the truth, it is not sufficient to
overthrow the things that are spoken on the other side, but also that
one should himself bring forward what he who is on the other side may
oppose.  Therefore, in order that both parties may be on an equal
footing, it seems to me to be right that each of us should first
enunciate what opinion he holds.  And, if you please, I shall begin
first.  I say, then, that the world is not governed according to the
providence of God, because we see that many things in it are done
unjustly and disorderly; but I say that it is *genesis* that does and
regulates all things.”
