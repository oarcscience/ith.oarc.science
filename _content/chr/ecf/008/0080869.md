Man.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.xi-p2"></span>“But they, because they had at first no
experience of evils, being insensible to the gift of good things, were
turned to ingratitude by abundance of food and luxuries, so that they
even thought that there is no Providence, since they had not by previous
labour got good things as the reward of righteousness, inasmuch as no
one of them had fallen into any suffering or disease, or any other
necessity; so that, as is usual for men afflicted on account of wicked
transgression, they should look about for the God who is able to heal
them. <span id="fr_1095"></span>[1096](#fn_1095)   But immediately after
their despite, which proceeded from fearlessness and secure luxury, a
certain just punishment met them, as following from a certain arranged
harmony, removing from them good things as having hurt them, and
introducing evil things instead, as advantageous.
