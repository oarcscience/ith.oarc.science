<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxii-p2"></A>&#8220;And therefore I advise that His righteousness be first inquired into, that, pursuing our journey through it, and placed in the way of truth, we may be able to find the true Prophet, running not with swiftness of foot, but with goodness of works, and that, enjoying His guidance, we may be under no danger of mistaking the way.&#160; For if under His guidance we shall merit to enter that city to which we desire to come, all things concerning which we now inquire we shall see with our eyes, being made, as it were, heirs of all things.&#160; Understand, therefore, that the way is this course of our life; the travellers are those who do good works; the gate is the true Prophet, of whom we speak; the city is the kingdom in which dwells the Almighty Father, whom only those can see who are of pure heart.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_616"></A><A HREF="#fn_616"><FONT SIZE="1">617</FONT></A>
&#160; Let us not then think the labour of this journey hard, because at the end of it there shall be rest.&#160; For the true Prophet Himself also from the beginning of the world, through the course of time, hastens to rest.&#160; For He is present with us at all times; and if at any time it is necessary, He appears and corrects us, that He may bring to eternal life those who obey Him.&#160; Therefore this is my judgment, as also it is the pleasure of the true Prophet, that inquiry should first be made concerning righteousness, by those especially who profess that they know God.&#160; If therefore any one has anything to propose which he thinks better, let him speak; and when he has spoken, let him hear, but with patience and quietness:&#160; for in order to this at the first, by way of salutation, I prayed for peace to you all.&#8221;</p>
