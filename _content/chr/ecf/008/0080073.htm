<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xi-p2"></A>At length I said to him, &#8220;Only expound to me the doctrine of that man who you say has appeared, and I will arrange your sayings in my language, and will preach the kingdom and righteousness of Almighty God; and after that, if you wish it, I shall even sail along with you, for I am extremely desirous to see Jud&aelig;a, and perhaps I shall remain with you always.&#8221;&#160; To this he answered, &#8220;If indeed you wish to see our country, and to learn those things which you desire, set sail with me even now; or, if there be anything that detains you now, I shall leave with you directions to my dwelling, so that when you please to come you may easily find me; for tomorrow I shall set out on my journey.&#8221;&#160; When I saw him determined, I went down with him to the harbour, and carefully took from him the directions which he gave me to find his dwelling.&#160; I told him that, but for the necessity of getting some money which was due to me, I should not at all delay, but that I should speedily follow him.&#160; Having told him this, I commended him to the kindness of those who had charge of the ship, and returned sad; for I was possessed of the memory of the intercourse which I had had with an excellent guest and a choice friend.</p>
