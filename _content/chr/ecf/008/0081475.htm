<p class="c51"><a name="ix.xiii.v-p3"></A>Abgar sends princes to Marinus; these deputies see our Saviour Christ; beginning of the conversion of Abgar.</p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.xiii.v-p4"></A>At this period Marinus, son of Storoge, was raised by the emperor to the government of Ph&#339;nicia, Palestine, Syria, and Mesopotamia.&#160; Abgar sent to him two of his principal officers, Mar-Ihap prince of Aghtznik, and Chamchacram chief of the house of the Abahouni, as well as Anan his confidant.&#160; The envoys proceed to the town of Petkoupine to make known to Marinus the reasons of Abgar&#146;s journey to the East, showing him the treaty concluded between Ardach&egrave;s and his brothers, and at the same time to call upon Marinus for his support.&#160; The deputies found the Roman governor at Eleutheropolis; he received them with friendship and distinction, and gave this answer to Abgar:&#160; &#8220;Fear nothing from the emperor on that account, provided you take good care to pay the tribute regularly.&#8221;</p>
