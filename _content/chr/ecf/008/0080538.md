id="vi.iii.xii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—Cosmogony of
Orpheus.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxx-p2"></span>“All the literature among the Greeks
which is written on the subject of the origin of antiquity, is based
upon many authorities, but especially two, Orpheus and Hesiod. <span
id="fr_867"></span>[868](#fn_867)   Now their writings are divided into
two parts, in respect of their meaning,—that is the literal and the
allegorical; and the vulgar crowd has flocked to the literal, but all
the eloquence of the philosophers and learned men is expended in
admiration of the allegorical.  It is Orpheus, then, who says that at
first there was chaos, eternal, unbounded, unproduced, and that from it
all things were made.  He says that this chaos was neither darkness nor
light, neither moist nor dry, neither hot nor cold, but that it was all
things mixed together, and was always one unformed mass; yet that at
length, as it were after the manner of a huge egg, it brought forth and
produced from itself a certain double form, which had been wrought
through immense periods of time, and which they call masculo-feminine, a
form concrete from the contrary admixture of such diversity; and that
this is the principle of all things, which came of pure matter, and
which, coming forth, effected a separation of the four elements, and
made heaven of the two elements which are first, *fire and air,* and
earth of the others, *earth and water;* and of these he says that all
things now are born and produced by a mutual participation of them.  So
far Orpheus.
