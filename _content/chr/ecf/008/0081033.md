id="vi.iv.xvii.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—The Old Man Opposes His
Personal Experience to the Argument of Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.vi-p2"></span>“And the old man answered: <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[1205](#fn_1204)   ‘You have spoken truly, <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[1206](#fn_1205) and yet, notwithstanding all your
incomparable demonstration, I am prevented from yielding assent by my
own personal knowledge.  For I was an astrologer, and dwelt first at
Rome; and then forming a friendship with one who was of the family of
Cæsar, I ascertained accurately the genesis of himself and his wife. 
And tracing their history, I find all the deeds actually accomplished in
exact accordance with their genesis, and therefore I cannot yield to
your argument.  For the arrangement <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[1207](#fn_1206) of her genesis was that which makes
women commit adultery, fall in love with their own slaves, and perish
abroad in the water.  And this actually took place; for she fell in love
with her own slave, and not being able to bear the reproach, she fled
with him, hurried to a foreign land, shared his bed, and perished in the
sea.’

general correspondence in *Recognitions*, ix. 32–37.  The arrangement is
quite different.  The old man’s representation, that the story he tells
is that of a friend, is peculiar to the *Homilies*.—R.\]
