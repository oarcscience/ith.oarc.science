<span id="ix.v.iii-p2"></span>*From the epistle of Addæus the apostle,
which he spake in the city of Edessa.* <span
id="fr_2945"></span>[2946](#fn_2945)

<span id="ix.v.iii-p4"></span>Give heed to this ministry which ye hold,
and with fear and trembling continue ye in it, and minister every day. 
Minister ye not in it with neglectful habits, but with the discreetness
of faith.  And let not the praises of Christ cease out of your mouth,
and let not any sense of weariness come over you at the season of
prayers.  Give heed to the verity which ye hold, and to the teaching of
the truth which ye have received, and to the teaching of salvation which
I commit to you.  Because before the tribunal of Christ will it be
required of you, when He maketh reckoning with the pastors and
overseers, and when He shall take His money from the traders with the
usury of what they have taught. <span
id="fr_2946"></span>[2947](#fn_2946)   For He is the Son of a King, and
goeth to receive a kingdom, and He will return and come and make a
resuscitation to life of all men.
