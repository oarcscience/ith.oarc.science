<span id="x.v.i-p1"></span> <span class="c6"><span
id="x.v.i-p1.1"></span>Melito, the Philosopher.</span>

<span id="x.v.i-p2"></span>\[<span class="c9"><span
id="x.v.i-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 160–170–177.\]  Melito <span
id="fr_3539"></span>[3540](#fn_3539) may have been the immediate
successor of the “angel” (or “apostle”) of the church of Sardis, to whom
our Great High Priest addressed one of the apocalyptic messages.  He was
an “Apostolic Father” in point of fact; he very probably knew the
blessed Polycarp and his disciple Irenæus.  He is justly revered for the
diligence with which he sought out the evidence which, in his day,
established the Canon of the Old Testament, then just complete.

<span id="x.v.i-p4"></span>In the following fragments we find him called
Bishop of Sardis, Bishop of Attica, and Bishop of Ittica.  He is also
introduced to us as “the Philosopher,” and we shall find him styled “the
Eunuch” by Polycrates.  It is supposed that he had made himself a cœlebs
“for the kingdom of heaven’s sake,” without mistaking our Lord’s intent,
as did Origen.  He was not a monk, but accepted a single estate to be
the more free and single-eyed in the Master’s service.  From the
encyclopedic erudition of Lightfoot we glean some particulars, as
follows:—

<span id="x.v.i-p5"></span>1.  I have adopted his date, as Lightfoot
gives it,—that is, the period of his writings,—under the Antonines.  The
improbability of seventy years in the episcopate is reason enough for
rejecting the idea that he was himself the “angel of the church of
Sardis,” to whom our Lord sent the terrible rebuke.

<span id="x.v.i-p6"></span>2.  His silence concerning persecutions under
Vespasian, Trojan, and Antoninus Pius cannot be pleaded to exempt them
from this stain, against positive evidence to the contrary.

<span id="x.v.i-p7"></span>3.  A coincidence with Ignatius to the
Ephesians <span id="fr_3540"></span>[3541](#fn_3540) will be noted
hereafter.

<span id="x.v.i-p9"></span>4.  Melito, with Claudius Apollinaris and
even Polycrates, may have been personally acquainted with
Ignatius; <span id="fr_3541"></span>[3542](#fn_3541) of course, one with
another.  These lived not far from Smyrna; Asia Minor was, in the first
century, the focus of Christian activity.

<span id="x.v.i-p11"></span>5.  We know of his visit to the East from
his own account, preserved by Eusebius.  The Christians of proconsular
Asia were accustomed to such journeys.  Even Clement of Alexandria may
have met him, as he seems to have met Tatian and Theodotus. <span
id="fr_3542"></span>[3543](#fn_3542)

<span id="x.v.i-p13"></span>6.  Melito vouches for the rescript of
Hadrian, <span id="fr_3543"></span>[3544](#fn_3543) but his supposed
reference to the edict of Antoninus does not bear close scrutiny as
warrant for its authenticity. <span id="fr_3544"></span>[3545](#fn_3544)

<span id="x.v.i-p16"></span><span id="page_751">p. 751</span> <span
id="x.v.i-Page_751"></span>7.  The Apology of our author was addressed
to Aurelius in his mid-career as a sovereign, about <span
class="c9"><span id="x.v.i-p16.1"></span>a.d.</span> 170.  Justin,
Melito, Athenagoras, and Theophilus all tell the same sad story of
imperial cruelty.  Even when Justin wrote to Antoninus, Marcus was
supreme in the councils of the elder emperor. <span
id="fr_3545"></span>[3546](#fn_3545)

<span id="x.v.i-p18"></span>8.  He became a martyr, probably under
Marcus Aurelius, *circa* <span class="c9"><span
id="x.v.i-p18.1"></span>a.d.</span> 177; <span
id="fr_3546"></span>[3547](#fn_3546) some eminent critics have even
dated his Apology as late as this.
