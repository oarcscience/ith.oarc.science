id="vi.iii.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Earth Made for
Men.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.vii-p2"></span>“For it is certain that these
images are made with iron tools; but iron is wrought by fire, which fire
is extinguished by water.  But water is moved by spirit; and spirit has
its beginning from God.  For thus saith the prophet Moses:  ‘In the
beginning God made the heaven and the earth.  But the earth was
invisible, and unarranged; and darkness was over the deep:  and the
Spirit of God was upon the waters.’ <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781)   Which Spirit, like the Creator’s
hand, by command of God separated light from darkness; and after that
invisible heaven produced this visible one, that He might make the
higher places a habitation for angels, and the lower for men.  For your
sake, therefore, by command of God, the water which was upon the face of
the earth withdrew, that the earth might produce fruits for you; and
into the earth also He inserted veins of moisture, that fountains and
rivers might flow forth from it for you.  For your sake it was commanded
to bring forth living creatures, and all things which could serve for
your use and pleasure.  Is it not for you that the winds blow, that the
earth, conceiving by them, may bring forth fruits?  Is it not for you
that the showers fall, and the seasons change?  Is it not for you that
the sun rises and sets, and the moon undergoes her changes?  For you the
sea offers its service, that all things may be subject to you,
ungrateful as you are.  For all these things shall there not be a
righteous punishment of vengeance, because beyond all else you are
ignorant of the bestower of all these things, whom you ought to
acknowledge and reverence above all?
