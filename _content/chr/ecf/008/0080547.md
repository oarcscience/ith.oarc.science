<span id="vi.iii.xii.xxxix-p2"></span>Then he answered:  “Be sure,
beloved Aquila, that all things are done by the good providence of God,
that the cause which was to be contrary to the truth should not only be
infirm and weak, but also base.  For if the assertion of error had been
stronger and more truth-like, any one who had been deceived by it would
not easily return to the path of truth.  If even now, when so many
wicked and disgraceful things are related concerning the gods of the
Gentiles, scarce any one forsakes the base error, how much more if there
had been in it anything seemly and truth-like?  For the mind is with
difficulty transferred from those things with which it has been imbued
in early youth; and on this account, as I said, it has been effected by
divine providence, that the substance of error should be both weak and
base.  But all other things also divine providence dispenses fitly and
advantageously, although the method of the divine dispensation, as good,
and the best possible, is not clear to us who are ignorant of the causes
of things.”
