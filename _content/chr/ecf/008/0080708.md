id="vi.iv.vi.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI.—The Eating of the Forbidden
Fruit Denied.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxi-p2"></span>“He himself being the only true
prophet, fittingly gave names to each animal, according to the merits of
its nature, as having made it.  For if he gave a name to any one, that
was also the name of that which was made, being given by him who made
it. <span id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964)   How, then, had he still
need to partake of a tree, that he might know what is good and what is
evil, if he was commanded not to eat of it?  But this senseless men
believe, who think that a reasonless beast was more powerful than the
God who made these things.
