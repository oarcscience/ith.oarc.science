<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xii.iv-p2"></A>And Pilate, filled with rage, went outside of the pr&aelig;torium, and said to them:&#160; I take the sun to witness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1817"></A><A HREF="#fn_1817"><FONT SIZE="1">1818</FONT></A>
 that I find no fault in this man. &#160;The Jews answered and said to the procurator:&#160; Unless this man were an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him to thee.&#160; And Pilate said, Do you take him, and judge him according to your law.&#160; The Jews said to Pilate:&#160; It is not lawful for us to put any one to death.&#160; Pilate said:&#160; Has God said that you are not to put to death, but that I am?</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xii.iv-p4"></A>And Pilate went again into the pr&aelig;torium, and spoke to Jesus privately, and said to Him:&#160; Art thou the king of the Jews?&#160; Jesus answered Pilate:&#160; Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others said it to thee of me?&#160; Pilate answered Jesus:&#160; Am I also a Jew?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1818"></A><A HREF="#fn_1818"><FONT SIZE="1">1819</FONT></A>
&#160; Thy nation and the chief priests have given thee up to me.&#160; What hast thou done?&#160; Jesus answered:&#160; My kingdom is not of this world; for if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight in order that I should not be given up to the Jews:&#160; but now my kingdom is not from thence.&#160; Pilate said to Him:&#160; Art thou then a king?&#160; Jesus answered him:&#160; Thou sayest that I am a king.&#160; Because for this have I been born, and have I come, in order that every one who is of the truth might hear my voice.&#160; Pilate says to him:&#160; What is truth?&#160; Jesus says to him:&#160; Truth is from heaven.&#160; Pilate says:&#160; Is truth not upon earth?&#160; Jesus says to Pilate:&#160; Thou seest how those who speak the truth are judged by those that have the power upon earth.</p>
