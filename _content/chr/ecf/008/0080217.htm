<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.vii-p2"></A>Then Simon, interrupting his discourse, said:&#160; &#8220;They do rightly who say that there is no evil.&#8221;&#160; <A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.v.vii-Page_119"></A>Then Peter answered:&#160; &#8220;We do not propose to speak of this now, but only to state the fact that the existence of evil is not universally admitted.&#160; But the second question that you should have asked is, What is evil?&#8212;a substance, an accident, or an act?&#160; And many other things of the same sort.&#160; And after that, towards what, or how it is, or to whom it is evil,&#8212;whether to God, or to angels, or to men, to the righteous or the wicked, to all or to some, to one&#146;s self or to no one?&#160; And then you should inquire, Whence it is?&#8212;whether from God, or from nothing; whether it has always been, or has had its beginning in time; whether it is useful or useless? and many other things which a proposition of this sort demands.&#8221;&#160; To this Simon answered:&#160; &#8220;Pardon me; I was in error concerning the first question; but suppose that I now ask first, whether evil is or not?&#8221;</p>
