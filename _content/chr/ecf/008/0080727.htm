<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xl-p2"></A>In like manner Simon, by taking many passages from the Scriptures, seemed to show that God is subject to every infirmity.&#160; And to this Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Does he who is evil, and wholly wicked, love to accuse himself in the things in which he sins?&#160; Answer me this.&#8221;&#160; Then said Simon:&#160; &#8220;He does not.&#8221;&#160; Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;How, then, can God be evil and wicked, seeing that those evil things which have been commonly written regarding Him, have been added by His own will!&#8221;&#160; Then said Simon:&#160; &#8220;It may be that the charge against Him is written by another power, and not according to His choice.&#8221;&#160; Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;Let us then, in the first place, inquire into this.&#160; If, indeed, He has of His own will accused Himself, as you formerly acknowledged, then He is not wicked; but if it is done by another power, it must be inquired and investigated with all energy who hath subjected to all evils Him who alone is good.&#8221;</p>
