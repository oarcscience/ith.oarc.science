id="vi.iii.vi.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Suffering Salutary.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xi-p2"></span>“By the most righteous judgment of
God, therefore, labours and afflictions are assigned as a remedy to men
languishing in the vanity of such thoughts.  And when labour and
tribulations came upon them, they were excluded from the place of
delights and amenity.  Also the earth began to produce nothing to them
without labour; and then men’s thoughts being turned in them, they were
warned to seek the aid of their Creator, and by prayers and vows to ask
for the divine protection.  And thus it came to pass, that the worship
of God, which they had neglected by reason of their prosperity, they
recovered through their adversity; and their thoughts towards God, which
indulgence had perverted, affliction corrected.  So therefore the divine
providence, seeing that this was more profitable to man, removed from
them the ways of benignity and abundance, as being hurtful, and
introduced the way of vexation and tribulation. <span
