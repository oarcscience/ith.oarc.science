<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lii-p2"></A>And when he had said this, and more to the same purpose, and had cured some who were present who were infirm and possessed of de<A NAME="page_206"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 206</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.xii.lii-Page_206"></A>mons, he dismissed the crowds, while they gave thanks and praised God, charging them to come to the same place on the following days also for the sake of hearing.&#160; And when we were together at home, and were preparing to eat, one entering told us that Appion Pleistonices,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_880"></A><A HREF="#fn_880"><FONT SIZE="1">881</FONT></A>
 with Anubion, were lately come from Antioch, and were lodging with Simon.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_881"><FONT SIZE="1">882</FONT></A>
&#160; Then my father, when he heard this, rejoiced, and said to Peter:&#160; &#8220;If you permit me, I should like to go and salute Appion and Anubion, for they are great friends of mine; and perhaps I shall be able to persuade Anubion to dispute with Clement on the subject of <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lii-p4.1"></A>Genesis</span>.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter said:&#160; &#8220;I consent; and I commend you, because you respect your friends.&#160; But consider how all things occur to you according to your wish by God&#146;s providence; for, behold, not only have <i>the objects</i> <i>of</i> proper affection been restored to you by the appointment of God, but also the presence of your friends is arranged for you.&#8221;&#160; Then said my father:&#160; &#8220;Truly I consider that it is so as you say.&#8221;&#160; And when he had said this, he went away to Anubion.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lii-p3"></A> The name is generally written Apion.&#160; The meaning of Pleistonices is doubtful, some supposing that it indicates his birthplace, some his father; but generally it is taken as an epithet, and it will then refer to his frequent victories in literary contests.&#160; [See Homily IV. 3, and the discussions with Appion which follow in that homily and in V., VI.&#8212;R.]</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iii.xii.lii-p4"></A> [From this point the resemblance to the close of Homily XX. (chaps. 11&#8211;22) is quite marked.&#160; But in the <i>Recognitions</i> the conclusion is more detailed and complete; see chap. 65.&#160; This is in accordance with the general design of this narrative, which gives greater prominence to the family of Clement.&#8212;R.]</p>
