id="vi.iv.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—Clement Instructed by
Barnabas.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xiii-p2"></span>While I spake these words, and others
to the same effect, there arose a great excitement among the crowd; and
some as pitying Barnabas, sympathized with me; but others, being
senseless, terribly gnashed their teeth against me.  But, as the evening
had already come, I took Barnabas by the hand, and by force conducted
him, against his will, to my lodging, and constrained him to remain
there, lest some one might lay hands on him.  And having spent several
days, and instructed me briefly in the true doctrine, as well as he
could in a few days, he said that he should hasten into Judæa for the
observance of the festival, and also because he wished for the future to
consort with those of his own nation.
