<span id="vi.iv.xx.x-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xx.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X.—The Nature and Shape of
God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.x-p2"></span>“This is the mystery of the hebdomad. 
For He Himself is the rest of the whole who grants <span
id="page_321">p. 321</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xx.x-Page_321"></span>Himself as a rest to those who imitate
His greatness within their little measure.  For He is alone, sometimes
comprehensible, sometimes incomprehensible, *sometimes limitable*, <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[1341](#fn_1340) sometimes illimitable, having
extensions which proceed from Him into infinity.  For thus He is
comprehensible and incomprehensible, near and far, being here and there,
as being the only existent one, and as giving a share of that mind which
is infinite on every hand, in consequence of which souls breathe and
possess life; <span id="fr_1341"></span>[1342](#fn_1341) and if they be
separated from the body and be found with a longing for Him, they are
borne along into His bosom, as in the winter time the mists of the
mountains, attracted by the rays of the sun, are borne along
immortal <span id="fr_1342"></span>[1343](#fn_1342) to it.  What
affection ought therefore to arise within us if we gaze with our mind on
His beautiful shape!  But otherwise it is absurd *to speak of beauty*. 
For beauty cannot exist apart from shape; nor can one be attracted to
the love of God, nor even deem that he can see Him, if God has no form.

<span id="vi.iv.xx.x-p3"></span> The words in italics are inserted by
conjecture.  “Sometimes incomprehensible, sometimes illimitable,” occur
only in one<span class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.xx.x-p3.1"></span>ms.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xx.x-p4"></span> We have adopted Wieseler’s suggestions.

<span id="vi.iv.xx.x-p5"></span> This word is justly suspected.  The
passage is in other respects corrupt.
