<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p2"></A>When Peter said this, the multitudes applauded.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1378"></A><A HREF="#fn_1378"><FONT SIZE="1">1379</FONT></A>
&#160; But Simon, being thus exposed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1379"></A><A HREF="#fn_1379"><FONT SIZE="1">1380</FONT></A>
 blushed through shame, and rubbing his forehead, said:&#160; &#8220;Well, then, do they declare that I, a magician, yea, even I who syllogize, am conquered by Peter?&#160; It is not so.&#160; But if one should syllogize, though carried away and conquered, he still re<A NAME="page_327"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 327</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xxi.ix-Page_327"></A>tains the truth that is in him.&#160; For the weakness in the defender is not identical with the truth in the conquered man.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1380"></A><A HREF="#fn_1380"><FONT SIZE="1">1381</FONT></A>
&#160; But I assure you that I have judged all those who are bystanders worthy to know the unrevealed Father.&#160; Wherefore, because I publicly reveal him to them, you yourself, through envy, are angry with me who wish to confer a benefit on them.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p5"></A> This passage is deemed corrupt by commentators.&#160; We have made no change in the reading of the <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p5.1"></A>mss.</span>, except that of <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p5.2"></A>&#957;&#949;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;&#957;</span> into <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.ix-p5.3"></A>&#957;&#949;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, and perhaps even this is unnecessary.&#160; The last sentence means:&#160; &#8220;A man may overcome the weakness of his adversary:&#160; but he does not therefore strip him of the truth, which he possesses even when he is conquered.&#8221;&#160; The Latin translation of Cotelerius, with some emendations from later editors, yields this:&#160; &#8220;But they say that I, a magician, am not merely conquered by Peter, but reduced to straits by his reasonings.&#160; But not even though one be reduced to straits by reasonings, has he the truth which is in him conquered.&#160; For the weakness of the defender is not the truth of the conqueror.&#8221;</p>
