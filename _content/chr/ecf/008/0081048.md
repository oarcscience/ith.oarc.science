id="vi.iv.xviii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—The Present and the
Future.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.viii-p2"></span>“If, then, you wish to have an
accurate account of the matter, listen.  Those of whom you said a little
before that they receive injustice, rather act unjustly themselves; for
they who have chosen the future blessings, live along with the bad in
the present world, having many enjoyments the same as the bad,—such as
life itself, light, bread, water, clothing, and others of a like
nature.  But they who are thought by you to act unjustly, shall not live
with the good <span id="page_311">p. 311</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xviii.viii-Page_311"></span>men in <span
id="fr_1240"></span>[1241](#fn_1240) the coming age.”  And our father
replied to this:  “Now when you have convinced me that those who act
unjustly suffer injustice themselves, while those who suffer injustice
have by far the advantage, the whole affair seems to me still more the
most unjust of transactions; for those who seem to act unjustly grant
many things to those who have chosen the future blessings, but those who
seem to receive injustice do themselves commit injustice, because they
do not give in the other world, to those who have given them blessings
here, the same advantages which these gave to them.”  And Peter said: 
“This is not unjust at all, because each one has the power to choose the
present or the future goods, whether they be small or great.  He who
chooses by his own individual judgment and wish, receives no
injustice,—I mean, not even should his choice rest on what is small,
since the great lay within his choice, as in fact did also the small.” 
And our father said:  “You are right; for it has been said by one of the
wise men of the Greeks, ‘The blame rests with those who chose—God is
blameless.’ <span id="fr_1241"></span>[1242](#fn_1241)
