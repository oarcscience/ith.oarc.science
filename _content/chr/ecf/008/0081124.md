<span id="vi.iv.xxii.v-Page_332"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—God Not Deserving of Blame in
Permitting the Existence of the Devil.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.v-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “It is my opinion
that, even if it be evident that he was made by God, the Creator who
made him should not be blamed; for it might perchance be found that the
service he performs <span id="fr_1417"></span>[1418](#fn_1417) was an
absolute necessity.  But if, on the other hand, it should be proved that
he was not created, inasmuch as he existed for ever, not even is the
Creator to be blamed in this respect, since He is better than all
*others*, even if He has not been able to put an end to a being who had
no beginning, because his nature did not admit of it; or if, being able,
He does not make away with him, deeming it unjust to put an end to that
which did not receive a beginning, and pardoning that which was by
nature wicked, because he could not have become anything else, even if
he were to wish to do so. <span id="fr_1418"></span>[1419](#fn_1418)  
But if, wishing to do good, He is not able, even in this case He is good
in that He has the will, though He has not the power; and while He has
not the power, He is yet the most powerful of all, in that the power is
not left to another.  But if there is some other that is able, and yet
does not accomplish it, it must be allowed that, in so far as, being
able, he does not accomplish it, he is wicked in not putting an end to
him, as if he took pleasure in the deeds done by him.  But if not even
he is able, then he is better who, though unable, is yet not unwilling
to benefit us according to his ability.”

<span id="fn_1417"></span>[332:1418](0081124.htm#fr_1417) <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.v-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.v-p3"></span> Lit., “his usefulness was most
necessary of all.”

<span id="fn_1418"></span>[332:1419](0081124.htm#fr_1418) <span
id="vi.iv.xxii.v-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.v-p4"></span> This sentence is obscure in the
original.  We have, with Wieseler, read <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.v-p4.1"></span>ἐπεί</span>, omitting <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.v-p4.2"></span>ἀρχῇ</span>.  Instead
of supplying <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xxii.v-p4.3"></span>μή</span>, we have turned <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxii.v-p4.4"></span>συγγνῶναι</span> into
the participle.
