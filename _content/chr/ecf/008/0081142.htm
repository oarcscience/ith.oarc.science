<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xxiii-p2"></A>And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Let me grant that this is the case:&#160; does not the inequality of lot amongst men seem to you most unjust?&#160; For one is in penury, another is rich; one is sick, another is in good health:&#160; and there are innumerable differences of a like character in human life.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1470"></A><A HREF="#fn_1470"><FONT SIZE="1">1471</FONT></A>
&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Do you not perceive, Simon, that you are again shooting your observations beyond the mark?&#160; For while we were discussing evil, you have made a digression, and introduced the question of the anomalies that appear in this world.&#160; But I shall speak even to this point.&#160; The world is an instrument artistically contrived, that for the male who is to exist eternally, the female may bear eternal righteous sons.&#160; Now they could not have been rendered perfectly pious here, had there been no needy ones for them to help.&#160; In like manner there are the sick, that they may have objects for their care.&#160; And the other afflictions admit of a like explanation.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Are not those in humble circumstances unfortunate? for they are subjected to distress, that others may be made righteous.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;If their humiliation were eternal, their misfortune would be very great.&#160; But the humiliations and exaltations of men take place according to lot; and he who is not pleased with his lot can appeal,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1471"></A><A HREF="#fn_1471"><FONT SIZE="1">1472</FONT></A>
 and by trying his case according to law, he can exchange his mode of life for another.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;What do you mean by this lot and this appeal?&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;You are now demanding the exposition of another topic; but if you permit me, we can show you how, being born again, and changing your origin, and living according to law, you will obtain eternal salvation.&#8221;</p>
