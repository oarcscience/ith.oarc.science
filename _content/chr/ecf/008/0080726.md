<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.—Defects Ascribed to
God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxix-p2"></span>“Therefore also Adam, being made at
first after his likeness, is created blind, and is said not to have
knowledge of good or evil, and is found a transgressor, and is driven
out of paradise, and is punished with death.  In like manner also, he
who made him, because he sees not in all places, says with reference to
the overthrow of Sodom, ‘Come, and let us go down, and see whether they
do according to their cry which comes to me; or if not, that I may
know.’ <span id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979)   Thus he shows himself
ignorant.  And in his saying respecting Adam, ‘Let us drive him out,
lest he put forth his hand and touch the tree of life, and eat, and live
for ever;’ <span id="fr_980"></span>[981](#fn_980) in saying <span
class="c9"><span id="vi.iv.vi.xxxix-p4.2"></span>Lest</span> he is
ignorant; and in driving him out lest he should eat and live for ever,
he is also envious.  And whereas it is written that ‘God repented that
he had made man,’ <span id="fr_981"></span>[982](#fn_981) this implies
both repentance and ignorance.  For this reflection is a view by which
one, through ignorance, wishes to inquire into the result of the things
which he wills, or it is the act of one repenting on account of the
event not being according to his expectation.  And whereas it is
written, ‘And the Lord smelled a scent of sweetness,’ <span
id="fr_982"></span>[983](#fn_982) it is the part of one in need; and his
being pleased with the fat of flesh is the part of one who is not good. 
But his tempting, as it is written, ‘And God did tempt Abraham,’ <span
id="fr_983"></span>[984](#fn_983) is the part of one who is wicked, and
who is ignorant of the issue of the experiment.”
