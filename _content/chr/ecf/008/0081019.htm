<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvi.xiv-p2"></A>&#8220;But some one will say, &#145;How many have perished on account of chastity!&#146;&#160; Yes; but it was because they did not perceive the danger.&#160; For the woman who perceives that she is in love with any one, or is beloved by any one, should immediately shun all association with him as she would shun a blazing fire or a mad dog.&#160; And this is exactly what your mother did, for she really loved chastity as a blessing:&#160; wherefore she was preserved, and, along with you, obtained the full knowledge of the everlasting kingdom.&#160; The woman who wishes to be chaste, ought to know that she is envied by wickedness, and that because of love many lie in wait for her.&#160; If, then, she remain holy through a stedfast persistence in chastity, she will gain the victory over all temptations, and be saved; whereas, even if she were to do all that is right, and yet should once commit the sin of adultery, she must be punished, as said the prophet.</p>
