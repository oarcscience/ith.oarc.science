<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.xxxviii-p2"></A>To this speech of Simon, Peter answered:&#160; &#8220;Do not meddle with the things that belong to others; for that you are a magician, you have confessed and made manifest by the very deeds that you have done; but our Master, who is the Son of God and of man, is manifestly good; and that he is truly the Son of God has been told, and shall be told to those to whom it is fitting.&#160; But if you will not confess that you are a magician, let us go, with all this multitude, to your house, and then it will be evident who is a magician.&#8221;&#160; While Peter was speaking thus, Simon began to assail him with blasphemies and curses, that he might make a riot, and excite all so that he could not be refuted, and that Peter, withdrawing on account of his blasphemy, might seem to be overcome.&#160; But he stood fast, and began to charge him more vehemently.</p>
