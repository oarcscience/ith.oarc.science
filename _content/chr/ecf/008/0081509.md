<span id="x.v.xii-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="x.v.xii-p2.1"></span>From the Catena on Genesis. <span
id="fr_3623"></span>[3624](#fn_3623) </span>

<span id="x.v.xii-p4"></span>In place of Isaac the just, a ram appeared
for slaughter, in order that Isaac might be liberated from *his* bonds. 
The slaughter of this *animal* redeemed Isaac *from death*.  In like
manner, the Lord, being slain, saved us; being bound, He loosed us;
being sacrificed, He redeemed us…

<span id="x.v.xii-p5"></span>For the Lord was a lamb, like the ram which
Abraham saw caught in the bush Sabec. <span
id="fr_3624"></span>[3625](#fn_3624)   But this bush represented the
cross, and that place Jerusalem, and the lamb the Lord bound for
slaughter.

<span id="x.v.xii-p7"></span>For as a ram was He bound, says he
concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, and as a lamb was He shorn, and as a
sheep was He led to the slaughter, and as a lamb was He crucified; and
He carried the cross <span id="fr_3625"></span>[3626](#fn_3625) on His
shoulders when He was led up *to the hill* to be slain, as was Isaac by
his father.  But Christ suffered, and Isaac did not suffer:  for he was
*but* a type of Him who should suffer.  Yet, even when serving *only*
for a type of Christ, he smote men with astonishment and fear.

<span id="x.v.xii-p9"></span>For a new mystery was presented to view,—a
son led by his father to a mountain to be slain, whose feet he bound
together, and laid him on the wood of the sacrifice, preparing with
care <span id="fr_3626"></span>[3627](#fn_3626) whatever was necessary
to his immolation.  Isaac on his part is silent, bound like a ram, not
opening his mouth, nor uttering a sound with his voice.  For, not
fearing the knife, nor quailing before the fire, nor troubled by *the
prospect of* suffering, he sustained bravely *the character of* the type
of the Lord.  Accordingly there lies <span id="page_760">p. 760</span>
<span id="x.v.xii-Page_760"></span>Isaac before us, with his feet bound
like a ram, his father standing by, with the knife all bare in his hand,
not shrinking from shedding the blood of his son.
