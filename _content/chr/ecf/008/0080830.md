Explanation.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.ix.xii-p2"></span>And I answered: <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069)   “I shall not at present speak
particularly of that living egg, which was conceived by a happy
combination out of infinite matter, and from which, when it was broken,
the masculo-feminine Phanes leaped forth, as some say.  I say little
about all that, up to the point when this broken globe attained
coherency, there being left in it some of its marrow-like matter; and I
shall briefly run over the description of what took place in it by the
agency of this matter, with all that followed.  For from Kronos and Rhea
were born, as you say—that is, by time and matter—first Pluto, who
represents the sediment which settled down; and then Poseidon, the
liquid substance in the middle, <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[1071](#fn_1070) which floated over the heavier body
below; and the third child—that is, Zeus—is the æther, and is highest of
all.  It was not devoured; but as it is a fiery power, and naturally
ascends, it flew up as with a bound to the very highest æther.
