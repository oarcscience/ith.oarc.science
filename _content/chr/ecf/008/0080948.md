<span id="vi.iv.xiv.xiv-p2"></span>“Oh men without understanding!  Judge
ye rightly of what is said.  For if it were necessary to give one’s self
to some pleasure for the refreshment of the body, whether were it better
to do so among the rivers and woods and groves, where there are
entertainments and convivialities and shady places, or where there is
the madness of demons, and cuttings of hands, and emasculations, and
fury and mania, and dishevelling of hair, and shoutings and enthusiasms
and howlings, and all those things which are done with hypocrisy for the
confounding of the unthinking, when you offer your prescribed prayers
and thanksgivings even to those who are deader than the dead?
