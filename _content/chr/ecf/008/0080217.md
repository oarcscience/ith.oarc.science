id="vi.iii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII.—Not Admitted by All.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.vii-p2"></span>Then Simon, interrupting his
discourse, said:  “They do rightly who say that there is no evil.” 
<span id="page_119">p. 119</span> <span
id="vi.iii.v.vii-Page_119"></span>Then Peter answered:  “We do not
propose to speak of this now, but only to state the fact that the
existence of evil is not universally admitted.  But the second question
that you should have asked is, What is evil?—a substance, an accident,
or an act?  And many other things of the same sort.  And after that,
towards what, or how it is, or to whom it is evil,—whether to God, or to
angels, or to men, to the righteous or the wicked, to all or to some, to
one’s self or to no one?  And then you should inquire, Whence it
is?—whether from God, or from nothing; whether it has always been, or
has had its beginning in time; whether it is useful or useless? and many
other things which a proposition of this sort demands.”  To this Simon
answered:  “Pardon me; I was in error concerning the first question; but
suppose that I now ask first, whether evil is or not?”
