<span id="vi.iv.xix.xviii-p2"></span>And Simon said:  “Is this word
‘God’ His ineffable name, which all use, because you maintain so
strongly in regard to a name that it cannot be given to another?”  And
Peter said:  “I know that this is not His ineffable name, but one which
is given by agreement among men; but if you give it to another, you will
also assign to this other that which is not used; and that, too,
deliberately. <span id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304)   The name
which is used is the forerunner of that which is not used.  In this way
insolence is attributed even to that which has not yet been spoken, just
as honour paid to that which is known is handed on to that which has not
yet been known.”
