<span id="vii.xiv.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 2 (18).</span>

<span id="vii.xiv.ii-p2"></span>O Lord Jesus Christ, the resurrection
and the life of the world, grant us grace that we may give an account of
Thy resurrection, and Thy miracles which Thou didst in Hades.  We then
were in Hades, with all who had fallen asleep since the beginning of the
world.  And at the hour of midnight there rose a light as if of the sun,
and shone into these dark *regions;* and we were all lighted up, and saw
each other.  And straightway our father Abraham was united with the
patriarchs and the prophets, and at the same time they were filled with
joy, and said to each other:  This light is from a great source of
light.  The prophet Hesaias, who was there present, said:  This light is
from the Father, and from the Son, and from the Holy Spirit; about whom
I prophesied when yet alive, saying, The land of Zabulon, and the land
of Nephthalim, the people that sat in darkness, have seen a great
light. <span id="fr_1930"></span>[1931](#fn_1930)

<span id="vii.xiv.ii-p4"></span>Then there came into the midst another,
an ascetic from the desert; and the patriarchs said to him:  Who art
thou?  And he said:  I am John, the last of the prophets, who made the
paths of the Son of God straight, <span
id="fr_1931"></span>[1932](#fn_1931) and proclaimed to the people
repentance for the remission of sins. <span
id="fr_1932"></span>[1933](#fn_1932)   And the Son of God came to me;
and I, seeing Him a long way off, said to the people:  Behold the Lamb
of God, who taketh away the sin of the world. <span
id="fr_1933"></span>[1934](#fn_1933)   And with my hand I baptized Him
in the river Jordan, and I saw like a dove also the Holy Spirit coming
upon Him; <span id="fr_1934"></span>[1935](#fn_1934) and I heard also
the voice of God, even the Father, <span
id="fr_1935"></span>[1936](#fn_1935) thus saying:  This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased. <span
id="fr_1936"></span>[1937](#fn_1936)   And on this account He sent me
also to you, to proclaim how the only begotten Son of God is coming
here, that whosoever shall believe in Him shall be saved, and whosoever
shall not be<span id="page_436">p. 436</span> <span
id="vii.xiv.ii-Page_436"></span>lieve in Him shall be condemned. <span
id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937)   On this account I say to you all,
in order that when you see Him you all may adore Him, that now only is
for you the time of repentance for having adored idols in the vain upper
world, and for the sins you have committed, and that this is impossible
at any other time.
