<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.i-p3"></A><span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.i-p3.1"></A>Much</span> earlier than usual Peter awoke, and came to us, and awaking us, said:&#160; &#8220;Let Faustinus and Faustinianus, along with Clement and the household, accompany me, that we may go to some sheltered spot by the sea, and there be able to baptize her without attracting observation.&#8221;&#160; Accordingly, when we had come to the sea-shore, he baptized her between some rocks, which supplied a place at once free from wind and dust.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1188"></A><A HREF="#fn_1188"><FONT SIZE="1">1189</FONT></A>
&#160; But we brothers, along with our brother and some others, retired because of the women and bathed, and coming again to the women, we took them along with us, and thus we went to a secret place and prayed.&#160; Then Peter, on account of the multitude, sent the women on before, ordering them to go to their lodging by another way, and he permitted us alone of the men to accompany our mother and the rest of the women.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1189"></A><A HREF="#fn_1189"><FONT SIZE="1">1190</FONT></A>
&#160; We went then to our lodging, and while waiting for Peter&#146;s arrival, we conversed with each other.&#160; Peter came several hours after, and breaking the bread for the Eucharist,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1190"></A><A HREF="#fn_1190"><FONT SIZE="1">1191</FONT></A>
 and putting salt upon it, he gave it first to our mother, and, after her, to us her sons.&#160; And thus we took food along with her and blessed God.</p>
