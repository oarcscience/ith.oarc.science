<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xix.ix-p2"></A>And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;I adduced clear passages from the Scriptures to prove that there are many gods; and you, in reply, brought forward as many or more from the same Scriptures, showing that God is one, and He the God of the Jews.&#160; And when I said that we ought not to revile gods, you proceeded to show that He who created is one, because those who did not create will perish.&#160; And in reply to my assertion that we ought to maintain that there are gods, because the Scriptures also say so, you showed that we ought not to utter their names, because the same Scripture tells us not to utter the names of other gods.&#160; Since, then, these very Scriptures say at one time that there are many gods, and at another that there is only one; and sometimes that they ought not to be reviled, and at other times that they ought; what conclusion ought we to come to in consequence of this, but that the Scriptures themselves lead us astray?&#8221;</p>
