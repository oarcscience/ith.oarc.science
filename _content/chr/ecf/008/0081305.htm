<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.v-p2"></A>Pilate therefore, leaving Jesus within the pr&aelig;torium, went out to the Jews, and says to them:&#160; I find not even one fault in him.&#160; The Jews say to him:&#160; He said, I can destroy that temple, and in three days raise it again.&#160; Pilate said to them:&#160; What temple?&#160; The Jews say to him:&#160; <i>The temple</i> which Solomon built in forty and six years; and he says <i>that he can</i> destroy and build it in three days.&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; I am innocent of the blood of this man; see ye <i>to it</i>.&#160; The Jews say to him:&#160; His blood <i>be</i> upon us, and upon our children.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.v-p3"></A>And Pilate, calling the elders and priests and Levites, says to them privately:&#160; Do not do so; for in nothing, though you accuse him, do I find him deserving of death, not even about the healing and the breaking of the Sabbath.&#160; The priests and Levites and elders say:&#160; Tell us, if any one blaspheme C&aelig;sar, is he deserving of death or not?&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; He deserves to die.&#160; The Jews answered him: &#160;How much more is he who has blasphemed God deserving to die!</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.v-p4"></A>And the governor ordered the Jews to go outside of the pr&aelig;torium; and calling Jesus, said to Him:&#160; What am I to do to thee?&#160; Jesus says to Pilate:&#160; As it has been given <i>thee</i>.&#160; Pilate says:&#160; How has it been given?&#160; Jesus says:&#160; Moses and the prophets made proclamation of my death and resurrection.&#160; And the Jews, hearing this, say to Pilate:&#160; Why do you desire any more to hear blasphemy?&#160; And Pilate said:&#160; If this speech is blasphemous, do you take him, and lead him to your synagogue, and judge him according to your law.&#160; The Jews say to Pilate:&#160; Our law holds, If a man have sinned against a man, he is worthy to receive forty less one; but he who has blasphemed against God, to be stoned.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.v-p5"></A>Pilate says to them:&#160; Then judge him according to your law.&#160; The Jews say to Pilate:&#160; We wish that he be crucified.&#160; Pilate says to them:&#160; He does not deserve to be crucified.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.v-p6"></A>And the governor, looking upon the people of the Jews standing round, saw very many of the Jews weeping, and said:&#160; All the multitude does not wish him to die.&#160; The elders say to Pilate:&#160; And for this reason have we come&#8212;the whole multitude&#8212;that he should die.&#160; Pilate said to the Jews:&#160; What has he done that he <A NAME="page_442"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 442</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xv.v-Page_442"></A>should die?&#160; They say:&#160; Because he said that he was the Son of God, and a king.</p>
