<span id="vi.iii.iii.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL.—Advent of the True
Prophet.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xl-p2"></span>“These things therefore having been
fore-arranged, He who was expected comes, bringing signs and miracles as
His credentials by which He should be made manifest.  But not even so
did the people believe, though they had been trained during so many ages
to the belief of these things.  And not only did they not believe, but
they added blasphemy to unbelief, saying that He was a gluttonous man
and a belly-slave, and that He was actuated by a demon, <span
id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563) even He who had come for their
salvation.  To such an extent does wickedness prevail by the agency of
evil ones; so that, but for the Wisdom of God assisting those who love
the truth, almost all would have been involved in impious delusion. 
Therefore He chose us twelve, <span id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564)
the first who believed in Him, whom He named apostles; and afterwards
other seventy-two most approved disciples, <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565) that, at least in this way recognising
the pattern of Moses, <span id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566) the
multitude might believe that this is He of whom Moses foretold, the
Prophet that was to come.” <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567)
