<span id="vi.iv.v.xxxii-p2"></span>Aquila having thus spoken, I Clement
inquired:  “What, then, are the prodigies that he works?”  And they told
me that he makes statues walk, and that he rolls himself on the fire,
and is not burnt; and sometimes he flies; and he makes loaves of stones;
he becomes a serpent; he transforms himself into a goat; he becomes
two-faced; he changes himself into gold; he opens lockfast gates; he
melts iron; at banquets he produces images of all manner of forms.  In
his house he makes dishes be seen as borne of themselves to wait upon
him, no bearers being seen.  I wondered when I heard them speak thus;
but many bore witness that they had been present, and had seen such
things.
