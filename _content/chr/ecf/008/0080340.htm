<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.xxvi-p2"></A>&#8220;But it is said:&#160; We do better, who give thanks both to Himself, and to all with Him.&#160; In this you do not understand that there is the ruin of your salvation.&#160; For it is as if a sick man should call in for his cure at once a physician and poisoners; since these could indeed injure him, but not cure him; and the true physician would refuse to mix his remedies with their poisons, lest either the man&#146;s destruction should be ascribed to the good, or his recovery, to the injurious.&#160; But you say:&#160; Is God then indignant or envious, if, when He benefits us, our thanks be rendered to others?&#160; Even if He be not indignant, at all events He does not wish to be the author of error, that by means of His work credit should be given to a vain idol.&#160; And what is so impious, so ungrateful, as to obtain a benefit from God, and to render thanks to blocks of wood and stone?&#160; Wherefore arise, and understand your salvation.&#160; For God is in need of no one, nor does He require anything, nor is He hurt by anything; but we are either helped or hurt, in that we are grateful or ungrateful.&#160; For what does God gain from our praises, or what does He lose by our blasphemies?&#160; Only this we must remember, that God brings into proximity and friendship with Himself the soul that renders thanks to Him.&#160; But the wicked demon possesses the ungrateful soul.</p>
