<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.lvii-p2"></A>Then the old man:&#160; &#8220;Do not take amiss, my son, what I am going to say.&#160; Though your words are powerful, yet they cannot lead me to believe that anything can be done apart from <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.x.lvii-p2.1"></A>Genesis</span>.&#160; For I know that all things have happened to me by the necessity of <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iii.x.lvii-p2.2"></A>Genesis</span>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_827"></A><A HREF="#fn_827"><FONT SIZE="1">828</FONT></A>
