<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.xvi-p2"></A>&#8220;But know all of you that the bishop labours more than you all; because each of you suffers his own affliction, but he his own and that of every one.&#160; Wherefore, O Clement, preside as a helper to every one according to your ability, being careful of the cares of all.&#160; Whence I know that in your undertaking the administration, I do not confer, but receive, a favour.&#160; But take courage and bear it generously, as knowing that God will recompense you when you enter the haven of rest, the greatest of blessings, a reward that cannot be taken from you, in proportion as you have undertaken more labour for the safety of all.&#160; So that, if many of the brethren should hate you on account of your lofty righteousness, their hatred shall nothing hurt you, but the love of the righteous God shall greatly benefit you.&#160; Therefore endeavour to shake off the praise that arises from injustice, and to attain the profitable praise that is from Christ on account of righteous administration.&#8221;</p>
