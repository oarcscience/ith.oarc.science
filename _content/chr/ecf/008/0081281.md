<span id="vii.xiii.xi"></span>

<span id="vii.xiii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xiii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 10.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii.xi-p2"></span>The sentence to this effect, then,
having been passed by Pilate, the Jews began to strike Jesus, some with
rods, others with *their* hands, others with *their* feet; some also
spat in His face.  Immediately, therefore, they got ready the cross, and
gave it to Him, and flew to take the road.  And thus going along,
bearing also the cross, He came as far as the gate of the city of
Jerusalem.  But as He, from the many blows and the weight of the cross,
was unable to walk, the Jews, out of the eager desire they had to
crucify Him as quickly as possible, took the cross from Him, and gave it
to a man that met them, Simon by name, who had also two sons, Alexander
and Rufus.  And he was from the city of Cyrene. <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900)   They gave the cross, then, to
him, not because they pitied Jesus, and wished to lighten Him of the
weight, but because they eagerly desired, as has been said, to put Him
to death more speedily.

<span id="vii.xiii.xi-p4"></span>Of His disciples, therefore, John
followed Him there.  Then he came fleeing to the mother of God, <span
id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901) and said to her:  Where hast <span
id="page_430">p. 430</span> <span id="vii.xiii.xi-Page_430"></span>thou
been, that thou hast not come to see what has happened?  She answered: 
What is it that has happened?  John says:  Know that the Jews have laid
hold of my Master, and are taking Him away to crucify Him.  Hearing
this, His mother cried out with a loud voice, saying:  My son, my son,
what evil then hast thou done, that <span
id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902) they are taking thee away to
crucify thee?  And she rose up as if blinded, <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903) and goes along the road weeping. 
And women followed her—Martha, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other
virgins.  And John also was with her.  When, therefore, they came to the
multitude of the crowd, the mother of God says to John:  Where is my
son?  John says:  Seest thou Him bearing the crown of thorns, and having
His hands bound?  And the mother of God, hearing this, and seeing Him,
fainted, and fell backwards to the ground, and lay a considerable time. 
And the women, as many as followed her, stood round her, and wept.  And
as soon as she revived and rose up, she cried out with a loud voice:  My
Lord, my son, where has the beauty of thy form sunk? how shall I endure
to see thee suffering such things?  And thus saying, she tore her face
with her nails, and beat her breast.  Where are they gone, said she, the
good deeds which thou didst in Judæa?  What evil hast thou done to the
Jews?  The Jews, then, seeing her thus lamenting and crying, came and
drove her from the road; but she would not flee, but remained, saying: 
Kill me first, ye lawless Jews.

<span id="vii.xiii.xi-p8"></span>Then they got safe to the place called
Cranium, which was paved with stone; <span
id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904) and there the Jews set up the
cross.  Then they stripped Jesus, and the soldiers took His garments,
and divided them among themselves; and they put on Him a tattered robe
of scarlet, and raised Him, and drew Him up on the cross at the sixth
hour of the day.  After this they brought also two robbers, the one on
His right, the other on His left.

<span id="vii.xiii.xi-p10"></span>Then the mother of God, standing and
looking, cried out with a loud voice, saying:  My son! my son!  And
Jesus, turning to her, and seeing John near her, and weeping with the
rest of the women, said:  Behold thy son!  Then He says also to John: 
Behold thy mother! <span id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905)   And she
wept much, saying:  For this I weep, my son, because thou sufferest
unjustly, because the lawless Jews have delivered thee to a bitter
death.  Without thee, my son, what will become of me?  How shall I live
without thee?  What sort of life shall I spend?  Where are thy
disciples, who boasted that they would die with thee?  Where those
healed by thee?  How has no one been found to help thee?  And looking to
the cross, she said:  Bend down, O cross, that I may embrace and kiss my
son, whom I suckled at these breasts after a strange manner, as not
having known man.  Bend down, O cross; I wish to throw my arms round my
son.  Bend down, O cross, that I may bid farewell to my son like a
mother.  The Jews, hearing these words, came forward, and drove to a
distance both her and the women and John.

<span id="vii.xiii.xi-p12"></span>Then Jesus cried out with a loud
voice, saying:  Father, let not this sin stand against them; for they
know not what they do. <span id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906)   Then
He says:  I thirst.  And immediately there ran one of the soldiers, and
took a sponge, and filled it with gall and vinegar mixed, and put it on
a reed, and gave Jesus to drink.  And having tasted it, He would not
drink it. <span id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907)   And the Jews
standing and looking on laughed at Him, and said:  If thou truly sayst
that thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross, and immediately,
that we may believe in thee.  Others said mocking:  Others he saved,
others he cured, and he healed the sick, the paralytic, the lepers, the
demoniacs, the blind, the lame, the dead; and himself he cannot
cure. <span id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908)

<span id="vii.xiii.xi-p16"></span>In the same manner also, the robber
crucified on His left hand said to Him:  If thou art the Son of God,
come down and save both thyself and us.  His name was Gistas.  And he
that was crucified on the right, Dysmas by name, reproved that robber,
saying:  O wretched and miserable man, dost thou not fear God?  We
suffer the due punishment of what we have done; but this man has done no
evil at all.  And turning to Jesus, he says to Him:  Lord, when Thou
shalt reign do not forget me.  And He said to him:  To-day, I tell thee
truth, I shall have thee in paradise with me. <span
