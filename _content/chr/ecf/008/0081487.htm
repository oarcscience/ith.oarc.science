</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.xvii-p5"></A><span class="c9"><a name="ix.xvii-p5.1"></A>Mara</span>, son of Serapion, to Serapion, my son:&#160; peace.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p6"></A>When thy master and guardian wrote me a letter, and informed me that thou wast very diligent in study, <i>though so</i> young in years, I blessed God that thou, a little boy, <i>and</i> without a guide <i>to direct thee</i>, hadst begun in good earnest; and to myself <i>also</i> this was a comfort&#8212;that I heard of thee, little boy <i>as thou art, as displaying</i> such greatness of mind and conscientiousness:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3463"></A><A HREF="#fn_3463"><FONT SIZE="1">3464</FONT></A>
&#160; <i>a character</i> which, in the case of many <i>who have begun well</i>, has shown no eagerness to continue.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p8"></A>On this account, lo, I have written for thee this record, <i>touching</i> that which I have by careful observation discovered in the world.&#160; For the kind of life men lead has been carefully observed by me.&#160; I tread the path of learning,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3464"></A><A HREF="#fn_3464"><FONT SIZE="1">3465</FONT></A>
 and from the study of Greek philosophy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3465"></A><A HREF="#fn_3465"><FONT SIZE="1">3466</FONT></A>
 have I found out all these things, although they suffered shipwreck when the birth of life took place.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3466"></A><A HREF="#fn_3466"><FONT SIZE="1">3467</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p12"></A>Be diligent, then, my son, in <i>attention to</i> those things which are becoming for the free,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3467"></A><A HREF="#fn_3467"><FONT SIZE="1">3468</FONT></A>
 <i>so as</i> to devote thyself to learning, and to follow after wisdom; and endeavour thus to become confirmed in those <i>habits</i> with which thou hast begun.&#160; Call to mind also my precepts, as a quiet person who is fond of the pursuit of learning.&#160; And, even though <i>such a life</i> should seem to thee very irksome, <i>yet</i> when thou hast made experience of it for a little while, it will become very pleasant to thee:&#160; for to me also it so happened.&#160; When, moreover, a person has left his home, and is able <i>still</i> to preserve his <i>previous</i> character, and properly does that which it behoves him to do, he is that chosen man who is called &#8220;the blessing of God,&#8221; and one who does not find aught else to compare with his freedom.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3468"></A><A HREF="#fn_3468"><FONT SIZE="1">3469</FONT></A>
&#160; For, as for those persons who are called to the pursuit of learning, they are seeking to extricate themselves from the turmoils of time; and those who take hold upon wisdom, they are clinging to the hope of righteousness; and those who take their stand on truth, they are displaying the banner of their virtue; and those who cultivate philosophy, they are looking to escape from the vexations of the world.&#160; And do thou too, my son, thus wisely behave thyself in <i>regard to</i> these things, as a wise person who seeks to spend a pure life; and <i>beware</i> lest the gain which many hunger after enervate thee, and thy mind turn to covet riches, which have no stability.&#160; For, when they are acquired by fraud, they do not continue; nor, even when justly <i>obtained</i>, do they last; and all those things which are seen by thee in the world, as belonging to that which is <i>only</i> for a little time, <i>are destined</i> to depart like a dream:&#160; for they are <i>but as</i> the risings and settings of the seasons.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p15"></A>About the <i>objects of that</i> vainglory, too, of which the life of men is full, be not thou solicitous:&#160; seeing that from those things which give us joy there quickly comes to us harm.&#160; Most especially <i>is this the case with</i> the birth of beloved children.&#160; For in two respects it plainly brings us harm:&#160; in the case of the virtuous, <i>our very</i> affection for them torments us, and from their <i>very excellence of</i> character we suffer torture; and, in the case of the vicious, we are worried with their correction, and afflicted with their misconduct.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p16"></A>Thou hast heard,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3469"></A><A HREF="#fn_3469"><FONT SIZE="1">3470</FONT></A>
 moreover, concerning our companions, that, when they were leaving Samosata, they were distressed <i>about it</i>, and, as if complaining of the time <i>in which their lot was cast</i>, said thus:&#160; &#8220;We are now far removed from our home, and we cannot return <i>again</i> to our <A NAME="page_736"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 736</FONT></A> <a name="ix.xvii-Page_736"></A>city, or behold our people, or offer to our gods the greeting of praise.&#8221;&#160; Meet was it that that day should be called <i>a day</i> of lamentation, because one heavy grief possessed them all alike.&#160; For they wept as they remembered their fathers, and <i>they thought of</i> their mothers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3470"></A><A HREF="#fn_3470"><FONT SIZE="1">3471</FONT></A>
 with sobs, and they were distressed for their brethren, <i>and</i> grieved for their betrothed whom they had left behind.&#160; And, although we had heard that their&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3471"></A><A HREF="#fn_3471"><FONT SIZE="1">3472</FONT></A>
 former companions were proceeding to Seleucia, we clandestinely <i>set out, and</i> proceeded on the way towards them, and united our own misery with theirs.&#160; Then was our grief exceedingly violent, and fitly did our weeping abound, by reason of our desperate plight, and our wailing gathered <i>itself into</i> a dense cloud,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3472"></A><A HREF="#fn_3472"><FONT SIZE="1">3473</FONT></A>
 and our misery grew vaster than a mountain:&#160; for not one of us had the power to ward off the disasters that assailed him.&#160; For affection for the living was intense, as well as sorrow for the dead, and our miseries were driving us on without any way <i>of escape</i>.&#160; For we saw our brethren and our children captives, and we remembered our deceased companions, who were laid <i>to rest</i> in a foreign&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3473"></A><A HREF="#fn_3473"><FONT SIZE="1">3474</FONT></A>
 land.&#160; Each one of us, too, was anxious for himself, lest he should have disaster added to disaster, or lest another calamity should overtake that which went before it.&#160; What enjoyment could men have that were prisoners, <i>and</i> who experienced <i>things like</i> these?</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p22"></A>But as for thee, my beloved, be not distressed because in thy loneliness thou hast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3474"></A><A HREF="#fn_3474"><FONT SIZE="1">3475</FONT></A>
 been driven from place to place.&#160; For to these things men are born, since they <i>are destined</i> to meet with the accidents of time.&#160; But <i>rather</i> let thy thought be this, that to wise men every place is alike, and <i>that</i> in every city the good have many fathers and mothers.&#160; Else, <i>if thou doubt it</i>, take thee a proof from <i>what thou hast seen</i> thyself.&#160; How many people who know thee not love thee as <i>one of</i> their own children; and <i>what</i> a host of women receive thee as <i>they would</i> their own beloved ones!&#160; Verily, as a stranger thou hast been fortunate; verily, for thy small love many people have conceived an ardent affection for thee.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p24"></A>What, again, are we to say concerning the delusion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3475"></A><A HREF="#fn_3475"><FONT SIZE="1">3476</FONT></A>
 which has taken up its abode in the world?&#160; Both by reason of toil&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3476"></A><A HREF="#fn_3476"><FONT SIZE="1">3477</FONT></A>
 painful is the journey through it, and by its agitations are we, like a reed by the force of the wind, bent now in this direction, now in that.&#160; For I have been amazed at many who cast away their children, and I have been astonished at others who bring up those that are not theirs.&#160; There are persons who acquire riches in the world, and I have also been astonished at others who inherit that which is not <i>of</i> their own <i>acquisition</i>.&#160; Thus <i>mayest thou</i> understand and see that we are walking under the guidance of delusion.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p27"></A>Begin and tell us, O wisest of men,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3477"></A><A HREF="#fn_3477"><FONT SIZE="1">3478</FONT></A>
 on which of <i>his</i> possessions a man can place reliance, or concerning what things he can say that they are such as abide.&#160; <i>Wilt thou say so</i> of abundance of riches? they are snatched away.&#160; Of fortresses? they are spoiled.&#160; Of cities? they are laid waste.&#160; Of greatness? it is brought down.&#160; Of magnificence? it is overthrown.&#160; Of beauty? it withers.&#160; Or of laws? they pass away.&#160; Or of poverty? it is despised.&#160; Or of children? they die.&#160; Or of friends? they prove false.&#160; Or of the praises <i>of men?</i> jealousy goes before them.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p29"></A>Let a man, therefore, rejoice in his empire, like Darius; or in his good fortune, like Polycrates; or in his bravery, like Achilles; or in his wife, like Agamemnon; or in his offspring, like Priam; or in his skill, like Archimedes; or in his wisdom, like Socrates; or in his learning, like Pythagoras; or in his ingenuity, like Palamedes;&#8212;the life of men, my son, departs from the world, but their praises and their virtues abide for ever.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p30"></A>Do thou, then, my little son, choose thee that which fadeth not away.&#160; For those who occupy themselves with these things are called modest, and <i>are</i> beloved, and lovers of a good name.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p31"></A>When, moreover, anything untoward befalls thee, do not lay the blame on man, nor be angry against God, nor fulminate against the time thou livest in.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p32"></A>If thou shalt continue in this mind, thy gift is not small which thou hast received from God, which has no need of riches, and is never reduced to poverty.&#160; For without fear shalt thou pass thy life,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3478"></A><A HREF="#fn_3478"><FONT SIZE="1">3479</FONT></A>
 and with rejoicing.&#160; For fear and apologies for <i>one&#146;s</i> nature belong not to the wise, but to such as walk contrary to law.&#160; For no man has even been deprived of his wisdom, as of his property.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p34"></A>Follow diligently learning rather than riches.&#160; For the greater are <i>one&#146;s</i> possessions, the greater is the evil <i>attendant upon them</i>.&#160; For I have myself observed that, where <i>a man&#146;s</i> goods are many, so also are the tribulations which happen <i>to him;</i> and, where luxuries are accumulated, there also do sorrows congregate; and, where riches are abundant, there is <i>stored up</i> the bitterness of many a year.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p35"></A><A NAME="page_737"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 737</FONT></A> <a name="ix.xvii-Page_737"></A>If, therefore, thou shalt behave with understanding, and shalt diligently watch over <i>thy conduct</i>, God will not refrain from helping thee, nor men from loving thee.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p36"></A>Let that which thou art able to acquire suffice thee; and if, moreover, thou art able to do without property, thou shalt be called blessed, and no man whatsoever shall be jealous of thee.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p37"></A>And remember also this, that nothing will disturb thy life very greatly, except <i>it be the love of</i> gain; <i>and</i> that no man after his death is called an owner of property:&#160; because it is by the desire of this that weak men are led captive, and they know not that a man dwells among his possessions <i>only</i> in the manner of a chance-comer, and they are haunted with fear because these <i>possessions</i> are not secured to them:&#160; for they abandoned that which is their own, and seek that which is not theirs.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p38"></A>What are we to say, when the wise are dragged by force by the hands of tyrants, and their wisdom is deprived of its freedom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3479"></A><A HREF="#fn_3479"><FONT SIZE="1">3480</FONT></A>
 by slander, and they are plundered for their <i>superior</i> intelligence, without <i>the opportunity of making</i> a defence?&#160; <i>They are not wholly to be pitied</i>.&#160; For what benefit did the Athenians obtain by putting Socrates to death, seeing that they received as retribution for it famine and pestilence?&#160; Or the people of Samos by the burning of Pythagoras, seeing that in one hour the whole&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3480"></A><A HREF="#fn_3480"><FONT SIZE="1">3481</FONT></A>
 of their country was covered with sand?&#160; Or the Jews <i>by the murder</i> of their Wise King, seeing that from that very time their kingdom was driven away <i>from them?</i>&#160; For with justice did God grant a recompense to the wisdom of <i>all</i> three of them.&#160; For the Athenians died by famine; and the people of Samos were covered by the sea without remedy; and the Jews, brought to desolation and expelled from their kingdom, are driven away into every land.&#160; <i>Nay</i>, Socrates did &#8220;not&#8221; die, because of Plato; nor yet Pythagoras, because of the statue of Hera; nor yet the Wise King, because of the new laws which he enacted.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p41"></A>Moreover I, my son, have attentively observed mankind, in what a dismal state of ruin they are.&#160; And I have been amazed that they are not utterly prostrated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3481"></A><A HREF="#fn_3481"><FONT SIZE="1">3482</FONT></A>
 by the calamities which surround them, and <i>that</i> even <i>their</i> wars&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3482"></A><A HREF="#fn_3482"><FONT SIZE="1">3483</FONT></A>
 are not enough for them, nor the pains <i>they endure</i>, nor the diseases, nor the death, nor the poverty; but <i>that</i>, like savage beasts, they must needs rush upon one another in <i>their</i> enmity, <i>trying</i> which of them shall inflict the greater mischief on his fellow.&#160; For they have broken away from the bounds of truth, and transgress all honest laws, because they are bent on fulfilling their selfish desires; for, whensoever a man is eagerly set on <i>obtaining</i> that which he desires, how is it possible that he should fitly do that which it behoves him <i>to do?</i> and they acknowledge no restraint,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3483"></A><A HREF="#fn_3483"><FONT SIZE="1">3484</FONT></A>
 and but seldom stretch out their hands towards truth and goodness, but in their manner of life behave like the deaf&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3484"></A><A HREF="#fn_3484"><FONT SIZE="1">3485</FONT></A>
 and the blind.&#160; Moreover, the wicked rejoice, and the righteous are disquieted.&#160; He that has, denies <i>that he has;</i> and he that has not, struggles to acquire.&#160; The poor seek <i>help</i>, and the rich hide <i>their wealth</i>, and every man laughs at his fellow.&#160; Those that are drunken are stupefied, and those that have recovered themselves are ashamed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3485"></A><A HREF="#fn_3485"><FONT SIZE="1">3486</FONT></A>
&#160; Some weep, and some sing; and some laugh, and others are a prey to care.&#160; They rejoice in things evil, and a man that speaks the truth they despise.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p47"></A>Should a man, then, be surprised when the world is seeking to wither him with <i>its</i> scorn, seeing that they <i>and he</i> have not one <i>and the same</i> manner of life?&#160; &#8220;These&#8221; are the things for which they care.&#160; One of them is looking <i>forward to the time</i> when in battle he shah obtain the renown of victory; yet the valiant perceive not by how many foolish objects of desire a man is led captive in the world.&#160; But would that for a little while self-repentance visited them!&#160; For, while victorious by their bravery, they are overcome by the power of covetousness.&#160; For I have made trial of men, and with this result:&#160; that the one thing on which they are intent, is abundance of riches.&#160; Therefore also it is that they have no settled purpose; but, through the instability of their minds, a man is of a sudden cast down <i>from his elation of spirit</i> to be swallowed up with sadness.&#160; They look not at the vast wealth of eternity, <i>nor consider</i> that every visitation of trouble is conducting us all alike to the same <i>final</i> period.&#160; For they are devoted to the majesty of the belly, <i>that</i> huge blot <i>on the character</i> of the vicious.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p48"></A>Moreover, <i>as regards</i> this <i>letter</i> which it has come into my mind to write to thee, it is not enough to read it, but the best thing is that it be put in practice.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3486"></A><A HREF="#fn_3486"><FONT SIZE="1">3487</FONT></A>
&#160; For I know for myself, that when thou shalt have made experiment of <A NAME="page_738"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 738</FONT></A> <a name="ix.xvii-Page_738"></A>this mode of life, it will be very pleasant to thee, and thou wilt be free from sore vexation; because it is <i>only</i> on account of children that we tolerate riches.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3487"></A><A HREF="#fn_3487"><FONT SIZE="1">3488</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p51"></A>Put, therefore, sadness away from thee, O <i>most</i> beloved of mankind,&#8212;a thing which never in anywise benefits <i>a man;</i> and drive care away from thee, which brings with it no advantage whatsoever.&#160; For we have no resource or skill <i>that can avail us</i>&#8212;<i>nothing</i> but a great mind <i>able</i> to cope with the disasters and to endure the tribulations which we are always receiving at the hands of the times.&#160; For at these things does it behove us to look, and not <i>only</i> at those which are fraught with rejoicing and good repute.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p52"></A>Devote thyself to wisdom, the fount of all things good, the treasure that faileth not.&#160; There shalt thou lay thy head, and be at ease.&#160; For this shall be to thee father and mother, and a good companion for thy life.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p53"></A>Enter into closest intimacy with fortitude and patience, those <i>virtues</i> which are able <i>successfully</i> to encounter the tribulations that befall feeble men.&#160; For so great is their strength, that they are adequate to sustain hunger, and <i>can</i> endure thirst, and mitigate every trouble.&#160; With toil, moreover, yea even with dissolution, they make right merry.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p54"></A>To these things give diligent attention, and thou shalt lead an untroubled life, and I also shall have comfort,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3488"></A><A HREF="#fn_3488"><FONT SIZE="1">3489</FONT></A>
 and thou shalt be called &#8220;the delight of his parents.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p56"></A>For in that time of yore, when our city was standing in her greatness, thou mayest be aware that against many persons <i>among us</i> abominable words were uttered; but for ourselves,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3489"></A><A HREF="#fn_3489"><FONT SIZE="1">3490</FONT></A>
 we acknowledged long ago that we received love, no less than honour, to the fullest extent from the multitude of her people:&#160; it was the state of the times <i>only</i> that forbade <i>our</i> completing those things which we had resolved on doing.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3490"></A><A HREF="#fn_3490"><FONT SIZE="1">3491</FONT></A>
&#160; And here also in the prison-house we give thanks to God that we have received the love of many:&#160; for we are striving to our utmost to maintain a life of sobriety and cheerfulness;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3491"></A><A HREF="#fn_3491"><FONT SIZE="1">3492</FONT></A>
 and, if anyone drive us by force, he will <i>but</i> be bearing public testimony against himself, that he is estranged from all things good, and he will receive disgrace and shame from the foul mark of shame <i>that is upon him</i>.&#160; For we have shown our truth&#8212;<i>that truth</i> which in our <i>now</i> ruined kingdom we possessed not.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3492"></A><A HREF="#fn_3492"><FONT SIZE="1">3493</FONT></A>
&#160; But, if the Romans shall permit us to go <i>back</i> to our own country, <i>as called upon</i> by justice and righteousness <i>to do</i>, they will be acting like humane men, and will earn the name of good and righteous, and at the same time <i>will have</i> a peaceful country in which to dwell:&#160; for they will exhibit their greatness when they shall leave us free men, <i>and</i> we shall be obedient to the sovereign power which the time has allotted to us.&#160; But let them not like tyrants, drive us as <i>though we were</i> slaves.&#160; Yet, if it has been <i>already</i> determined what shall be done, we shall receive nothing more <i>dreadful</i> than the peaceful death which is in store for us.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p61"></A>But thou, my little son, if thou resolve diligently to acquaint thyself with these things, first of all put a check on appetite, and set limits to that in which thou art <i>indulging</i>.&#160; Seek the power to refrain from being angry; and, instead of <i>yielding to</i> outbursts of passion, listen to <i>the promptings of</i> kindness.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p62"></A>For myself, what I am henceforth solicitous about is this&#8212;<i>that</i>, so far as I have recollections <i>of the past</i>, I may leave behind me a book <i>containing them</i>, and with a prudent mind finish the journey which I am appointed <i>to take</i>, and depart without suffering out of the sad afflictions of the world.&#160; For my prayer is, that I may receive <i>my</i> dismissal; and <i>by</i> what kind of death concerns me not.&#160; But, if any one should be troubled or anxious <i>about this</i>, I have no counsel to give him:&#160; for yonder, in the dwelling-place of all the world, will he find us before him.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p63"></A>One of his friends asked Mara, son of Serapion, when in bonds at his side:&#160; &#8220;Nay, by thy life, Mara, tell me what <i>cause</i> of laughter thou hast seen, that thou laughest.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;I am laughing,&#8221; said Mara, &#8220;at Time:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3493"></A><A HREF="#fn_3493"><FONT SIZE="1">3494</FONT></A>
&#160; inasmuch as, although he has not borrowed any evil from me, he is paying me back.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="ix.xvii-p65"></A><i>Here</i> endeth the letter of Mara, son of Serapion.</p>
