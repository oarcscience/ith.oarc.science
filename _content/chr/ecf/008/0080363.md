id="vi.iii.viii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Importance of
Chastity.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.viii.xii-p2"></span>“But this kind of chastity is also
to be observed, that sexual intercourse must not take place heedlessly
and for the sake of mere pleasure, but for the sake of begetting
children. <span id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785)   And since this
observance is found even amongst some of the lower animals, it were a
shame if it be not observed by men, reasonable, and worshipping God. 
But there is this further reason why chastity should be observed by
those who hold the true worship of God, in those forms of it of which we
have spoken, and others of like sort, that it is observed strictly even
amongst those <span id="page_156">p. 156</span> <span
id="vi.iii.viii.xii-Page_156"></span>who are still held by the devil in
error, for even amongst them there is in some degree the observance of
chastity.  What then?  Will you not observe, now that you are reformed,
what you observed when you were in error?
