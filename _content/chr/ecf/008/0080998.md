id="vi.iv.xv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.—Who Can Judge.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxvii-p2"></span>Then I said, “Then even God, who, as
you teach us, is at some time to judge, is not philanthropic.”  Then
said Peter, “You assert a contradiction; for because He shall judge, on
that very account He is philanthropic.  For he who loves and
compassionates those who have been wronged, avenges those who have
wronged them.”  Then I said, “If, then, I also do good to the good, and
punish the wrong-doers in respect of their injuring men, am I not
philanthropic?”  And Peter answered, “If along with knowledge <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148) you had also authority to judge,
you would do this rightly on account of your having received authority
to judge those whom God made, and on account of your knowledge
infallibly justifying some as the righteous, and condemning some as
unrighteous.”  Then I said, “You have spoken rightly and truly; for it
is impossible for any one who has not knowledge to judge rightly.  For
sometimes some persons seem good, though they perpetrate wickedness in
secret, and some good persons are conceived to be bad through the
accusation of their enemies.  But even if one judges, having the power
of torturing and examining, not even so should he altogether judge
righteously.  For some persons, being murderers, have sustained the
tortures, and have come off as innocent; while others, being innocent,
have not been able to sustain the tortures, but have confessed falsely
against themselves, and have been punished as guilty.”

<span id="vi.iv.xv.xxvii-p3"></span> The word repeatedly rendered
*knowledge* and once *omniscience* in this passage, properly signifies
foreknowledge.  The argument shows clearly that it means omniscience, of
which foreknowledge is the most signal manifestation.
