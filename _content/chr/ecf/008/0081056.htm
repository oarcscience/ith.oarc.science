<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xix.iv-p2"></A>Our father answered:&#160; &#8220;Do not compel me to agree with you without any exercise of my judgment in order that I may seem to be a <A NAME="page_313"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 313</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xix.iv-Page_313"></A>truth-loving judge; but if you wish me to tell you the truth, my prepossessions are rather the side of your opinions.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;How is this the case, when you do not know what my opinions are?&#8221;&#160; And our father said:&#160; &#8220;It is easy to know this, and I will tell you how.&#160; You promised that you would convict Peter of error in maintaining the unity of God; but if one undertakes to convict of error him who maintains the unity of God. it is perfectly plain that he, as being in the right,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1252"></A><A HREF="#fn_1252"><FONT SIZE="1">1253</FONT></A>
 does not hold the same opinion.&#160; For if he holds the same opinion as the man who is thoroughly in error, then he himself is in error; but if he gives his proofs holding opposite opinions, then he is in the right. &#160;Not well&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1253"></A><A HREF="#fn_1253"><FONT SIZE="1">1254</FONT></A>
 then do you assert that he who maintains the unity of God is wrong, unless you believe that there are many gods.&#160; Now I maintain that there are many gods.&#160; Holding, therefore, the same opinion as you before the discussion, I am prepossessed rather in your favour.&#160; For this reason you ought to have no anxiety in regard to me, but Peter ought, for I still hold opinions contrary to his.&#160; And so after your discussion I hope that, as a truth-loving judge, who has stripped himself of his prepossessions, I shall agree to that doctrine which gains the victor.&#8221;&#160; When my father said this, a murmur of applause burst insensibly from the multitudes because my father had thus spoken.</p>
