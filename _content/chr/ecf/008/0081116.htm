<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.xxi-p2"></A>When Peter said this, Simon pretended to be utterly astonished at what was said in regard to the Scriptures; and as if in great agitation, he said:&#160; &#8220;Far be it from me, and those who love me, to listen to your discourses.&#160; And, indeed, as long as I did not know that you held these opinions in regard to the Scriptures, I endured you, and discussed with you; but now I retire.&#160; Indeed, I ought at the first to have withdrawn, because I heard you say, &#145;I, for my part, believe no one who says anything against Him who created the world, neither angels, nor prophets, nor Scriptures, nor priests, nor teachers, nor any one else, even though one should work signs and miracles, even though he should lighten brilliantly in the air, or should make a revelation through visions or through dreams.&#146;&#160; Who, then, can succeed in changing your mind, whether well or ill, so as that you should hold opinions different from what you have determined on, seeing that you abide so persistently and immoveably in your own decision?&#8221;</p>
