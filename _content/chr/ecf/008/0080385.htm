<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xviii-p2"></A>&#8220;And, not to detain you with a long and profitless story, I willingly dwelt with her on account of the faithful affection which she retained for her husband.&#160; But not long after, my hands (unhappy woman that I was!), long torn with gnawing, became powerless, and she who had taken me in fell into palsy, and now lies at home in her bed; also the affection of those women who had formerly pitied me grew cold.&#160; We are both helpless.&#160; I, as you see, sit begging; and when I get anything, one meal serves two wretches.&#160; Behold, now you have heard enough of my affairs; why do you delay the fulfilment of your promise, to give me a remedy, by which both of us may end our miserable life without torment?&#8221;</p>
