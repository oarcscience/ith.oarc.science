&#160; But having entered the womb of Rachel, I was born of her as a man, that I might be visible to men.&#160; I have flown through the air; I have been mixed with fire, and been made one body with it; I have made statues to move; I have animated lifeless things; I have made stones bread; I have flown from mountain to mountain; I have moved from place to place, upheld by angels&#146; hands, and have lighted on the earth.&#160; Not only have I done these things; but even now I am able to do them, that by facts I may prove to all, that I am the Son of God, enduring to eternity, and that I can make those who believe on me endure in like manner for ever.&#160; But your words are all vain; nor can you perform any real works <i>such as I have now mentioned</i>, <A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.v.xxxvii-Page_127"></A>as he also who sent you is a magician, who yet could not deliver himself from the suffering of the cross.&#8221;</p>
