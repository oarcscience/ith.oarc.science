<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.lxv-p2"></A>&#8220;When I had thus spoken, the whole multitude of the priests were in a rage, because I had foretold to them the overthrow of the temple.&#160; Which when Gamaliel, a chief of the people, saw&#8212;who was secretly our brother in the faith, but by our advice remained among them&#8212;because they were greatly enraged and moved with intense fury against us, he stood up, and said,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">593</FONT></A>
 &#145;Be quiet for a little, O men of Israel, for ye do not perceive the trial which hangs over you.&#160; Wherefore refrain from these men; and if what they are engaged in be of human counsel, it will soon come to an end; but if it be from God, why will you sin without cause, and prevail nothing?&#160; For who can overpower the will of God?&#160; Now therefore, since the day is declining towards evening, I shall myself dispute with these men to-morrow, in this same place, in your hearing, so that I may openly oppose and clearly confute every error.&#146;&#160; By this speech of his their fury was to some extent checked, especially in the hope that next day we should be publicly convicted of error; and so he dismissed the people peacefully.&#8221;</p>
