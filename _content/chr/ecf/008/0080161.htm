<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxiv-p2"></A>To this Peter answered:&#160; &#8220;Hear with all attention, O men, what we say.&#160; Let us suppose that this world is a great plain, and that from two states, whose kings are at variance with each other, two generals were sent to fight:&#160; and suppose the general of the good king gave this counsel, that both armies should without bloodshed submit to the authority of the better king, whereby all should be safe without danger; but that the opposite general should say, No, but we must fight; that not he who is worthy, but who is stronger, may reign, with those who shall escape;&#8212;which, I ask you, would you rather choose?&#160; I doubt not but that you would give your hands to the better king, with the safety of all.&#160; And I do not now wish, as Simon says that I do, that assent should be given, for the sake of peace, to those things that are spoken amiss but that truth be sought for with quietness and order.</p>
