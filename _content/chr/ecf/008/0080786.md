To-Morrow.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xxv-p2"></span>“If the doings of the gods, being
good, have been veiled with evil fables, the wickedness of him who wove
the veil is shown to have been great, because he concealed noble things
with evil narratives, that no one imitate them.  But if they really did
things impious, they ought, on the contrary, to have veiled them with
good narratives, lest men, regarding them as their superiors, should set
about sinning in like manner.”  As I spoke thus, those present were
evidently beginning to be well-disposed towards the words spoken by me;
for they repeatedly and earnestly asked me to come on the following day,
and departed.
