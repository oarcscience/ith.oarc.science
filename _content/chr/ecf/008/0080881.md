<span id="vi.iv.xi.xxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—The Assembly
Dismissed.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xi.xxiii-p2"></span>“If, therefore, ye wish to be the
vesture of the Divine Spirit, hasten first to put off your base
presumption, which is an unclean spirit and a <span id="page_275">p.
275</span> <span id="vi.iv.xi.xxiii-Page_275"></span>foul garment.  And
this you cannot otherwise put off, than by being first baptized in good
works.  And thus being pure in body and in soul, you shall enjoy the
future eternal kingdom.  Therefore neither believe in idols, nor partake
with them of the impure table, nor commit murder, nor adultery, nor hate
those whom it is not right to hate, nor steal, nor set upon any evil
deeds; since, being deprived of the hope of future blessings in the
present life, you shall be subjected to evil demons and terrible
sufferings, and in the world to come you shall be punished with eternal
fire.  Now, then, what has been said is enough for to-day.  For the
rest, those of you who are afflicted with ailments remain for healing;
and of the others, you who please go in peace.”
