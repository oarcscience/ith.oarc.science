<span id="vi.iv.xvii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xvii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—Discussion on Genesis.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvii.xi-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “You did this
according to your resolution.  But in regard to Genesis, were you merely
playing a part when you affirmed it, or were you in earnest in asserting
that it existed?”  Our father said:  “I will not speak falsely to you. 
I was in earnest when I maintained that Genesis existed.  For I am not
uninitiated in the science; on the contrary, I associated with one who
is the best of the astrologers, an Egyptian of the name of Annubion, who
became my friend in the commencement of my travels, and disclosed to me
the death of my wife and children.” <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[1213](#fn_1212)   And Peter said:  “Are you not now
convinced by facts, that the doctrine of Genesis has no firm
foundation?”  And my father answered:  “I must lay before you all the
ideas that occur to my mind, that listening to them I may understand
your refutation of them. <span id="fr_1213"></span>[1214](#fn_1213)   I
know, indeed, that astrologers both make many mistakes, and frequently
speak the truth.  I suspect, therefore, that they speak the truth so far
as they are accurately acquainted with the science, and that their
mistakes are the result of ignorance; so that I conjecture that the
science has a firm foundation, but that the astrologers themselves speak
what is false solely on account of ignorance, because they cannot know
all things with absolute <span id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214)
accuracy.”  And Peter answered:  “Consider <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215) whether their speaking of the truth
is not accidental, and whether they do not make their declarations
without knowing the matters accurately.  For it must by all means happen
that, when many prophecies are uttered, some of them should come true.” 
And the old man said:  “How, then, is it possible to be fully convinced
of this, whether the science of Genesis has a sure foundation or not?”

their readings.  The text adopted seems a combination of two ideas: 
“that you may listen and refute them, and that I may thus learn the
truth.”
