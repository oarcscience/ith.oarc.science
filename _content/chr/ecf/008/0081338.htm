<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvii.vi-p2"></A>After that, another standing there, pre-eminent as it were, with a certain mark of an emperor, David by name, thus cried out, and said:&#160; When I was upon earth, I made revelations to the people of the mercy of God and His visitation, prophesying future joys, saying through all ages, Let them make confession to the Lord of His tender mercy and His wonderful works to the sons of men, because He has shattered the gates of brass, and broken the bars of iron.&#160; Then the holy patriarchs and prophets began mutually to recognise each other, and each to quote his prophecies.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.vi-p3"></A>Then holy Jeremias, examining his prophecies, said to the patriarchs and prophets:&#160; When I was upon earth, I prophesied of the Son of God, that He was seen upon earth, and dwelt with men.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvii.vi-p4"></A>Then all the saints, exulting in the light of the Lord, and in the sight of father Adam, and in the answering of all the patriarchs and prophets, cried out, saying:&#160; Alleluia! blessed is He who cometh in the name of the Lord; so that at their crying out Satan trembled, and sought a way of escape.&#160; And he could not, because Hades and his satellites kept him bound in the lower regions, and guarded at all points.&#160; And they said to him:&#160; Why dost thou tremble?&#160; We by no means allow thee to go forth hence.&#160; But receive this, as thou art worthy, from Him whom thou didst daily assail; but if not, know that thou, bound by Him, shall be in my keeping.</p>
