Egypt.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xxxiv-p2"></span>“Nevertheless, as he had got these
two sons during the time while he still lived in ignorance of things,
having received the knowledge of God, he asked of the Righteous One that
he might merit to have offspring by Sarah, who was his lawful wife,
though she was barren.  She obtained a son. whom he named Isaac, from
whom came Jacob, and from him the twelve patriarchs, and from these
twelve seventy-two.  These, when famine befell came into Egypt with all
their family; and in the course of four hundred years, being multiplied
by the blessing and promise of God, they were afflicted by the
Egyptians.  And when they were afflicted the true Prophet appeared to
Moses, <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555) and struck the Egyptians
with ten plagues, when they refused to let the Hebrew people depart from
them, and return to their native land; and he brought the people of God
out of Egypt.  But those of the Egyptians who survived the plagues,
being infected with the animosity of their king, pursued after the
Hebrews.  And when they had overtaken them at the sea-shore, and thought
to destroy and exterminate them all, Moses, pouring out prayer to God,
divided the sea into two parts, so that the water was held on the right
hand and on the left as if it had been frozen, and the people of God
passed as over a dry road; but the Egyptians who were pursuing them,
rashly entering, were drowned.  For when the last of the Hebrews came
out, the last of the Egyptians went down into the sea; and straight<span

the waters of the sea, which by his command were held bound as with
frost, were loosed by his command who had bound them, and recovering
their natural freedom, inflicted punishment on the wicked nation.
