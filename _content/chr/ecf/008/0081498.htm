<p class="c34"><a name="x.v.i-p1"></A> <span class="c6"><a name="x.v.i-p1.1"></A>Melito, the Philosopher.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="x.v.i-p2"></A>[<span class="c9"><a name="x.v.i-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 160&#8211;170&#8211;177.]&#160; Melito&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3539"></A><A HREF="#fn_3539"><FONT SIZE="1">3540</FONT></A>
 may have been the immediate successor of the &#8220;angel&#8221; (or &#8220;apostle&#8221;) of the church of Sardis, to whom our Great High Priest addressed one of the apocalyptic messages.&#160; He was an &#8220;Apostolic Father&#8221; in point of fact; he very probably knew the blessed Polycarp and his disciple Iren&aelig;us.&#160; He is justly revered for the diligence with which he sought out the evidence which, in his day, established the Canon of the Old Testament, then just complete.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.i-p4"></A>In the following fragments we find him called Bishop of Sardis, Bishop of Attica, and Bishop of Ittica.&#160; He is also introduced to us as &#8220;the Philosopher,&#8221; and we shall find him styled &#8220;the Eunuch&#8221; by Polycrates.&#160; It is supposed that he had made himself a c&#339;lebs &#8220;for the kingdom of heaven&#146;s sake,&#8221; without mistaking our Lord&#146;s intent, as did Origen.&#160; He was not a monk, but accepted a single estate to be the more free and single-eyed in the Master&#146;s service.&#160; From the encyclopedic erudition of Lightfoot we glean some particulars, as follows:&#8212;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.i-p5"></A>1.&#160; I have adopted his date, as Lightfoot gives it,&#8212;that is, the period of his writings,&#8212;under the Antonines.&#160; The improbability of seventy years in the episcopate is reason enough for rejecting the idea that he was himself the &#8220;angel of the church of Sardis,&#8221; to whom our Lord sent the terrible rebuke.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.i-p6"></A>2.&#160; His silence concerning persecutions under Vespasian, Trojan, and Antoninus Pius cannot be pleaded to exempt them from this stain, against positive evidence to the contrary.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.i-p7"></A>3.&#160; A coincidence with Ignatius to the Ephesians&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3540"></A><A HREF="#fn_3540"><FONT SIZE="1">3541</FONT></A>
 will be noted hereafter.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.i-p9"></A>4.&#160; Melito, with Claudius Apollinaris and even Polycrates, may have been personally acquainted with Ignatius;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3541"></A><A HREF="#fn_3541"><FONT SIZE="1">3542</FONT></A>
 of course, one with another.&#160; These lived not far from Smyrna; Asia Minor was, in the first century, the focus of Christian activity.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.i-p11"></A>5.&#160; We know of his visit to the East from his own account, preserved by Eusebius.&#160; The Christians of proconsular Asia were accustomed to such journeys.&#160; Even Clement of Alexandria may have met him, as he seems to have met Tatian and Theodotus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3542"></A><A HREF="#fn_3542"><FONT SIZE="1">3543</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.i-p13"></A>6.&#160; Melito vouches for the rescript of Hadrian,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3543"></A><A HREF="#fn_3543"><FONT SIZE="1">3544</FONT></A>
 but his supposed reference to the edict of Antoninus does not bear close scrutiny as warrant for its authenticity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3544"></A><A HREF="#fn_3544"><FONT SIZE="1">3545</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.i-p16"></A><A NAME="page_751"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 751</FONT></A> <a name="x.v.i-Page_751"></A>7.&#160; The Apology of our author was addressed to Aurelius in his mid-career as a sovereign, about <span class="c9"><a name="x.v.i-p16.1"></A>a.d.</span> 170.&#160; Justin, Melito, Athenagoras, and Theophilus all tell the same sad story of imperial cruelty.&#160; Even when Justin wrote to Antoninus, Marcus was supreme in the councils of the elder emperor.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3545"></A><A HREF="#fn_3545"><FONT SIZE="1">3546</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.i-p18"></A>8.&#160; He became a martyr, probably under Marcus Aurelius, <i>circa</i> <span class="c9"><a name="x.v.i-p18.1"></A>a.d.</span> 177;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3546"></A><A HREF="#fn_3546"><FONT SIZE="1">3547</FONT></A>
 some eminent critics have even dated his Apology as late as this.</p>
