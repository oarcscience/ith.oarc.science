<p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.xii-p2"></A>And Joseph, seeing that He had such favour, and that He was increasing in stature, thought it right to take Him to learn His letters.&#160; And he handed Him over to another teacher to be taught.&#160; And that teacher said to Joseph:&#160; What letters dost thou wish me to teach that boy?&#160; Joseph answered and said:&#160; First teach him the Gentile letters, and then the Hebrew.&#160; For the teacher knew that He was very intelligent, and willingly took Him in hand.&#160; And writing for Him the first line, which is A and B, he taught Him for some hours.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1771"></A><A HREF="#fn_1771"><FONT SIZE="1">1772</FONT></A>
&#160; But Jesus was silent, and made him no answer.&#160; Jesus said to the master:&#160; If thou art indeed a master, and if thou indeed knowest the letters, tell me the power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1772"></A><A HREF="#fn_1772"><FONT SIZE="1">1773</FONT></A>
 of the A, and I shall tell thee the power of the B.&#160; Then His master was filled with fury, and struck Him on the head.&#160; And Jesus was angry, and cursed him; and he suddenly fell down, and died.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.x.xii-p5"></A>And Jesus returned home.&#160; And Joseph gave orders to Mary His mother, not to let Him go out of the court of his house.</p>
