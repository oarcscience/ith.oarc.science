<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.iii-p2"></A>While Simon was talking on in this style, Peter, having saluted the people in his usual way, thus answered:&#160; &#8220;O Simon, his own conscience is sufficient for every one to confute him; but if you wonder at this, that those who are acquainted with you not only do not love you but even hate you, learn the reason from me.&#160; Since you are a seducer you profess to proclaim the truth; and on this account you had many friends who had a desire to learn the truth.&#160; But when they saw in you things contrary to what you professed, they being, as I said, lovers of truth, began not only not to love you, but even to hate you.&#160; But yet they did not immediately forsake you, because you still promised that you could show them what is true.&#160; As long, therefore, as no one was present who could show them, they bore with you; but since the hope of better instruction has dawned upon them, they despise you, and seek to know what they understand to be better.&#160; And you indeed, acting by nefarious arts, thought at first that you should escape detection.&#160; But <A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.v.iii-Page_118"></A>you are detected.&#160; For you are driven into a corner, and, contrary to your expectation, you are made notorious, not only as being ignorant of the truth, but as being unwilling to hear it from those who know it.&#160; For if you had been willing to hear, that saying would have been exemplified in you, of Him who said that &#145;there is nothing hidden which shall not be known, nor covered which shall not be disclosed.&#146;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">678</FONT></A>
