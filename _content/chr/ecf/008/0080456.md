id="vi.iii.x.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter L.—The Flood.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.x.l-p2"></span>“Wherefore, in short, at the first, when
all the earth had been stained with sins, God brought a flood upon the
world, which you say happened under Deucalion; and at that time He saved
a certain righteous man, with his sons, in an ark, and with him the race
of all plants and animals. <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823)   And
yet even those who sprang from them, after a time, again did deeds like
to those of their predecessors; for those things that had befallen them
were forgotten, so that their descendants did not even believe that the
flood had taken place.  Wherefore God also decreed that there should not
be another flood in the present world, else there should have been one
in every generation, according to the account of their sins by reason of
their unbelief; but He rather granted that certain angels who delight in
evil should bear sway over the several nations—and to them was given
power over individual men, yet only on this condition, if any one first
had made himself subject to them by sinning—until He should come who
delights in good, and by Him the number of the righteous should be
completed, and by the increase of the number of <span id="page_179">p.

world impiety should be in some measure repressed, and it should be
known to all that all that is good is done by God.
