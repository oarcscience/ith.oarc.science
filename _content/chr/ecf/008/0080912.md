id="vi.iv.xiii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—The Fear of God.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiii.v-p2"></span>“Therefore you shall be able to
persuade yourselves with respect to the things that are profitable, if,
like charmers, you say to the horrible serpent which lurks in your
heart, ‘The Lord God thou shalt fear, and Him alone thou shalt
serve.’ <span id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120)   On every account it
is advantageous to fear Him alone, not as an unjust, but as a righteous
God.  For one fears an unjust being, lest he be wrongfully destroyed,
but a righteous one, lest he be caught in sin and punished.  You can
therefore, by fear towards Him, be freed from many hurtful fears.  For
if you do not fear the one Lord and Maker of all, you shall be the
slaves of all evils to your own hurt, I mean of demons and diseases, and
of everything that can in any way hurt you.
