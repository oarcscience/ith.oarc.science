<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xi.xxxv-p2"></A>When he had said this, he turned to the crowds, and thus began:&#160; &#8220;This person whom you see, O men, in this poor garb, is a citizen of the city Rome, descended of the stock of C&aelig;sar himself.&#160; His name is Faustinianus.&#160; He obtained as his wife a woman of the highest rank, Matthidia by name.&#160; By her he had three sons, two of whom were twins; and the one who was the younger, whose name was Clement, is this man!&#8221;&#160; When he said this, he pointed to me with his finger.&#160; &#8220;And his twin sons are these men, Niceta and Aquila, the one of whom was formerly called Faustinus and the other Faustus.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_851"></A><A HREF="#fn_851"><FONT SIZE="1">852</FONT></A>
&#160; But as soon as Peter pronounced our names, all the old man&#146;s limbs were weakened, and he fell down in a swoon.&#160; But we his sons rushed to him, and embraced and kissed him, fearing that we might not be able to recall his spirit.&#160; And while these things were going on, the people were confounded with very wonder.</p>
