<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xii.xix-p2"></A>&#8220;For God is almighty.&#160; For He is good and righteous, now long-suffering to all, that those who will, repenting of the evils which they have done, and living well, may receive a worthy reward in the day in which all things are judged.&#160; Wherefore now begin to obey God by reason of <A NAME="page_279"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 279</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xii.xix-Page_279"></A>good knowledge,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1116"></A><A HREF="#fn_1116"><FONT SIZE="1">1117</FONT></A>
 and to oppose your evil lusts and thoughts, that you may be able to recover the original saving worship which was committed to humanity.&#160; For thus shall blessings straightway spring up to you, which, when you receive, you will thenceforth quit the trial of evils.&#160; But give thanks to the Giver; being kings for ever of unspeakable good things, with the King of peace.&#160; But in the present life, washing in a flowing river, or fountain, or even in the sea, with the thrice-blessed invocation, you shall not only be able to drive away the spirits which lurk in you; but yourselves no longer sinning, and undoubtingly believing God, you shall drive out evil spirits and dire demons, with terrible diseases, from others.&#160; And sometimes they shall flee when you but look on them.&#160; For they know those who have given themselves up to God.&#160; Wherefore, honouring them, they flee affrighted, as you saw yesterday, how, when after the address I delayed praying for those who were suffering these maladies, through respect towards the worship they cried out, not being able to endure it for a short hour.</p>
