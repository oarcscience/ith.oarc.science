Gelones.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.xi.xxii-p2"></span>“Amongst the Geli also there is a
custom, that women cultivate the fields, build, and do every manly work;
and they are also allowed to have intercourse with whom they please, and
are not found fault with by their husbands, or called adulteresses:  for
they have promiscuous intercourse everywhere, and especially with
strangers; they do not use ointments; they do not wear dyed garments,
nor shoes.  On the other hand, the men of the Gelones are adorned,
combed, clothed in soft and various-coloured garments, decked with gold,
and besmeared with ointments, and that not through lack of manliness,
for they are most warlike, and most keen hunters.  Yet the whole women
of the Gelones had not at their birth the unfavourable Venus in
Capricornus or Aquarius; nor had all their men Venus placed with Mars in
Aries, by which configuration the Chaldean science asserts that men are
born effeminate and dissolute.
