<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—Abel’s Name and
Nature.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xxvi-p2"></span>“But he who amongst the sons of men
had prophecy innate to his soul as belonging to it, expressly, as being
a male, indicating the hopes of the world to come, called his own son
Abel, which without any ambiguity is translated <span class="c9"><span
id="vi.iv.vi.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Grief</span>.  For he assigns to his sons
to grieve over their deceived brethren.  He does not deceive them when
he promises them comfort in the world to come.  When he says that we
must pray to one only God, he neither himself speaks of gods, nor does
he believe another who speaks of them.  He keeps the good which he has,
and increases more and more.  He hates sacrifices, bloodshed, and
libations; he loves the chaste, the pure, the holy.  He quenches the
fire of altars, represses wars, teaches pious preachers wisdom, purges
sins, sanctions marriage, approves temperance, leads all to chastity,
makes men liberal, prescribes justice, seals those of them who are
perfect, publishes the word of peace, prophesies explicitly, speaks
decidedly, frequently makes mention of the eternal fire of punishment,
constantly announces the kingdom of God, indicates heavenly riches,
promises unfading glory, shows the remission of sins by works.
