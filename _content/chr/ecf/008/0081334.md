<span id="vii.xvii.ii-p2"></span>I Karinus.  O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of
the living God, permit me to speak of Thy wonders which Thou hast done
in the lower world.  When, therefore, we were kept in darkness and the
shadow of death in the lower world, suddenly there shone upon us a great
light, and Hades and the gates of death trembled.  And then was heard
the voice of the Son of the Father most high, as if the voice of a great
thunder; and loudly proclaiming, He thus charged them:  Lift up your
gates, ye princes; lift up the everlasting gates; the King of glory,
Christ the Lord, will come up to enter in.

<span id="vii.xvii.ii-p3"></span>Then Satan, the leader of death, came
up, fleeing in terror, saying to his officers and the powers below:  My
officers, and all the powers below, run together, shut your gates, put
up the iron bars, and fight bravely, and resist, lest they lay hold of
us, and keep us captive in chains.  Then all his impious officers were
perplexed, and <span id="page_456">p. 456</span> <span
id="vii.xvii.ii-Page_456"></span>began to shut the gates of death with
all diligence, and by little and little to fasten the locks and the iron
bars, and to hold all their weapons <span

utter howlings in a direful and most hideous voice.
