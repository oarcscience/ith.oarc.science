<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.ix.xiii-p2"></A>&#8220;And the bonds of Kronos are the binding together of heaven and earth, as I have heard others allegorizing; and his mutilation is the separation and parting of the elements; for they all were severed and separated, according to their respective natures, that each kind might be arranged by itself.&#160; And time no longer begets anything; but the things which have been begotten of it, by a law of nature, produce their successors.&#160; And the Aphrodite who emerged from the sea is the fruitful substance which arises out of moisture, with which the warm spirit mixing, causes that sexual desire, and perfects the beauty of the world.</p>
