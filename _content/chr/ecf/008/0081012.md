<span id="vi.iv.xvi.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xvi.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Nicetas Tells What Befell
Him.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.vii-p2"></span>And Nicetas, who in future is to be
called Faustinus, began to speak.  “On that very night when, as you
know, the ship went to pieces, we were taken up by some men, who did not
fear to follow the profession of robbers on the deep.  They placed us in
a boat, and brought us along the coast, sometimes rowing and sometimes
sending for provisions, and at length took us to Cæsarea
Stratonis, <span id="fr_1165"></span>[1166](#fn_1165) and there
tormented us by hunger, fear, and blows, that we might not recklessly
disclose anything which they did not wish us to tell; and, moreover,
changing our names, they succeeded in selling us.  Now the woman who
bought us was a proselyte of the Jews, an altogether worthy person, of
the name of Justa.  She adopted us as her own children, and zealously
brought us up in all the learning of the Greeks.  But we, becoming
discreet with our years, were strongly attached to her religion, and we
paid good heed to our culture, in order that, disputing with the other
nations, we might be able to convince them of their error.  We also made
an accurate study of the doctrines of the philosophers, especially the
most atheistic,—I mean those of Epicurus and Pyrrho,—in order that we
might be the better able to refute them. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[301:1166](0081012.htm#fr_1165) <span
id="vi.iv.xvi.vii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xvi.vii-p3"></span> This clause, literally translated,
is, “and sometimes impelling it with oars, they brought us along the
land; and sometimes sending for provisions, they conveyed us to Cæsarea
Stratonis.”  The Latin translator renders “to land,” not “along the
land.”  The passage assumes a different form in the *Recognitions*, the
first *Epitome*, and the second *Epitome*; and there is, no doubt, some
corruption in the text.  The text has <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xvi.vii-p3.1"></span>δακρύοντας</span>, which makes no sense. 
We have adopted the rendering given in the *Recognitions*.  Various
attempts have been made to amend the word.

to the discussions in which they appear as disputants.—R.\]
