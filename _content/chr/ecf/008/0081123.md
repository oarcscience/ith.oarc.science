id="vi.iv.xxii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—Suppositions in Regard to the
Devil’s Origin.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxii.iv-p2"></span>And Peter said:  “It must be so.” 
And Simon:  “Therefore, if he is originated, he has been made by that
very God who made all things, being either born as an animal, or sent
forth substantially, and resulting from an external mixture *of
elements*.  For either <span id="fr_1415"></span>[1416](#fn_1415) the
matter, being living or lifeless, from which he was made was outside of
Him, <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1417](#fn_1416) or he came into being
through God Himself, or through his own self, or he resulted from things
non-existent, or he is a mere relative thing, or he always existed. 
Having thus, as I think, clearly, pointed out all the possible ways by
which we may find him, in going along some one of these we must find
him.  We must therefore go along each one of these in search of his
origin; and when we find him who is his author, we must perceive that he
is to blame.  Or how does the matter seem to you?”
