<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.viii-p2"></A>When the old man had said this, I Clement said to him:&#160; &#8220;Hear, my father:&#160; if my brother Niceta bring you to acknowledge that the world is not governed without the providence of God, I shall be able to answer you in that part which remains concerning the <i>genesis</i>; for I am well acquainted with this doctrine.&#8221;&#160; And when I had thus spoken, my brother Aquila said:&#160; &#8220;What is the use of our calling him <i>father</i>, when we are commanded to call no man father upon earth?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_811"></A><A HREF="#fn_811"><FONT SIZE="1">812</FONT></A>
&#160; Then, looking to the old man, he said, &#8220;Do not take it amiss, my father, that I have found fault with my brother for calling you <i>father</i>, for we have a precept not to call any one by that name.&#8221;&#160; When Aquila said that, all the assembly of the bystanders, as well as the old man and Peter, <A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.x.viii-Page_168"></A>laughed.&#160; And when Aquila asked the reason of their all laughing, I said to him:&#160; &#8220;Because you yourself do the very thing which you find fault with in another; for you called the old man <i>father</i>.&#8221;&#160; But he denied it, saying:&#160; &#8220;I am not aware that I called him <i>father</i>.&#8221;&#160; Meantime Peter was moved with certain suspicions,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_812"></A><A HREF="#fn_812"><FONT SIZE="1">813</FONT></A>
 as he told us afterwards; and looking to Niceta, he said, &#8220;Go on with what you have proposed.&#8221;</p>
