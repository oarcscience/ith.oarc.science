<span id="vi.iv.xviii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—Difference Between the True
Religion and Philosophy.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.v-p2"></span>And our father began to say:  “Do not
suppose, my dearest Peter, that I am not thinking of the doctrines
preached by you.  I was thinking of them.  But during the past night,
when Clement urged me earnestly to give in my adhesion to the truth
preached by you, I at last answered, ‘Why should I? for what new
commandment can any one give more than what the ancients urged us to
obey?’  And he, with a gentle smile, said, ‘There is a great difference,
father, between the doctrines of the true religion and those of
philosophy; <span id="fr_1228"></span>[1229](#fn_1228) for the true
religion receives its proof from prophecy, while philoso<span
id="page_310">p. 310</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xviii.v-Page_310"></span>phy, furnishing us with beautiful
sentences, seems to present its proofs from conjecture.’  On saying
this, he took an instance, and set before us the doctrine of
philanthropy, <span id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229) which you had
explained to him, <span id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230) which
rather appeared to me to be very unjust, and I shall tell you how.  He
alleged that it was right to present to him who strikes you on the one
cheek the other <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231) also, and to
give to him who takes away your cloak your tunic also, and to go two
miles with him who compels you to go one, and such like.” <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232)

the word <span class="Greek"><span

Testament into <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.v-p6.3"></span>μαφόριον</span>, which Suicer describes
“a covering for the head, neck, and shoulders, used by women.”  Wieseler
is in doubt whether the writer of the *Homilies* uses <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xviii.v-p6.4"></span>μαφόριον</span> as
equivalent to <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.v-p6.5"></span>χιτῶνα</span>, or whether he
intentionally changed the word, for the person who lost both cloak and
tunic would be naked altogether; and this, the writer may have imagined,
Christ would not have commanded.

in chaps. 5–11 is peculiar to the *Homilies*.  There is little matter in
it found in the longer arguments of *Recognitions*.—R.\]
