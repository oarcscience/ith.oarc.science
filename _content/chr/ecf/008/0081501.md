<span id="x.v.iv-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span

<span id="x.v.iv-p4"></span>On these accounts He came to us; on these
accounts, though He was incorporeal, He formed for Himself a body after
our fashion, <span id="fr_3592"></span>[3593](#fn_3592) —appearing as a
sheep, yet still remaining the Shepherd; being esteemed a servant, yet
not renouncing the Sonship; being carried *in the womb* of Mary, yet
arrayed in *the nature of* His Father; treading upon the earth, yet
filling heaven; appearing as an infant, yet not discarding the eternity
of His nature; being invested with a body, yet not circumscribing the
unmixed simplicity of His Godhead; being esteemed poor, yet not divested
of His riches; needing sustenance inasmuch as He was man, yet not
ceasing to feed the entire world inasmuch as He is God; putting on the
likeness of a servant, yet not impairing <span
id="fr_3593"></span>[3594](#fn_3593) the likeness of His Father.  He
sustained every character <span id="fr_3594"></span>[3595](#fn_3594)
*belonging to Him* in an immutable nature:  He was standing before
Pilate, and *at the same time* was sitting with His Father; He was
nailed upon the tree, and *yet* was the Lord of all things.
