<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xvii.viii-p2"></A>&#8220;When the old man had thus spoken, I knew from what he said that the old man who he stated had died, was no other than your father.&#160; I did not wish, however, to communicate your circumstances to him until I should confer with you.&#160; But I ascertained where his lodging was, and I pointed out mine to him; and to make sure <i>that my conjecture was right</i>, I put this one question to him:&#160; &#145;What was the name of the old man?&#146;&#160; And he said, &#145;Faustus.&#146;&#160; &#145;And what were the names of his twin sons?&#146;&#160; And he answered, &#145;Faustinus and Faustinianus.&#146;&#160; &#145;What was the name of the third son?&#146;&#160; He said, &#145;Clement.&#146;&#160; &#145;What was their mother&#146;s name?&#146;&#160; He said, &#145;Mattidia.&#146;&#160; Accordingly, from compassion, I shed tears along with him, and, dismissing the multitudes, I came to you, in order that I might take counsel with you after we had partaken of food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1208"></A><A HREF="#fn_1208"><FONT SIZE="1">1209</FONT></A>
