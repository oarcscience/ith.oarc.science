id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XII.—Clement’s Arrival at
Cæsarea, and Introduction to Peter.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xii-p2"></span>Having then stopped for a few days,
and having in some measure finished the business of collecting what was
owing to me (for I neglected many things through my desire of hastening,
that I might not be hindered from my purpose), I set sail direct for
Judæa, and after fifteen days landed at Cæsarea Stratonis, which is the
largest city in Palestine. <span id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537)  
When I had landed, and was seeking for an inn, I learned from the
conversation of the people, that one Peter, a most approved disciple of
Him who appeared in Judæa, and showed many signs and miracles divinely
performed among men, was going to hold a discussion of words and
questions the next day with one Simon, a Samaritan.  Having heard this,
I asked to be shown his lodging; and having found it, and standing
before the door, I informed the doorkeeper who I was, and whence I came;
and, behold, Barnabas coming out, as soon as he saw me rushed into my
arms, weeping for joy, and, seizing me by the hand, led me in to Peter. 
Having pointed him out to me at a distance, “This,” said he, “is Peter,
of whom I spoke, to you as the greatest in the wisdom of God, and to
whom also I have spoken constantly of you.  Enter, therefore, as one
well known to him.  For he is well acquainted with all the good that is
in thee, and has carefully made himself aware of your religious purpose,
whence also he is greatly desirous to see you.  Therefore I present you
to him to-day as a great gift.”  At the same time, presenting me, he
said, “This, O Peter, is Clement.”
