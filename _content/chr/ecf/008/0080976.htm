<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xv.v-p2"></A>Then I answered, &#8220;Do not think, my lord, that I should endure that grief foolishly, but with some good reason.&#160; For since I hold you, my lord, in place of all, father, mother, brothers, relatives, you who are the means through God of my having the saving truth, holding you in place of all, I have the greatest consolation.&#160; And in addition to this, being afraid of my natural youthful lust, I was concerned lest, being left by you (being but a young man, and having now such a resolution that it would be impossible to desert you without incurring the anger of God,)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1142"></A><A HREF="#fn_1142"><FONT SIZE="1">1143</FONT></A>
 I should be overcome by lust.&#160; But since it is much better and safer for me to remain with you, when my mind is with good reason set upon venerating, therefore I pray that I may always remain with you.&#160; Moreover, I remember you saying in C&aelig;sarea, &#145;If any one wishes to journey with me, let him piously journey.&#146;&#160; And by <span class="c9"><a name="vi.iv.xv.v-p3.1"></A>piously</span> you meant, that those who are devoted to the worship of God should grieve no one in respect of God, such as by leaving parents, an attached wife, or any others.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1143"></A><A HREF="#fn_1143"><FONT SIZE="1">1144</FONT></A>
&#160; Whence I am in all respects a fitting fellow-traveller for you, to whom, if you would confer the greatest favour, you would allow to perform the functions of a servant.&#8221;</p>
