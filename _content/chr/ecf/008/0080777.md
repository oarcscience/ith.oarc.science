<span id="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Wickedness of
Jupiter.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p2"></span>“But I shall begin with the most
royal Zeus, whose father Kronos, having, as you say, devoured his own
children, and having shorn off the members of his father Uranus with a
sickle of adamant, showed to those who are zealous for the mysteries of
the gods an example of piety towards parents and of love towards
children.  And Jupiter himself bound his own father, and imprisoned him
in Tartarus; and he also punishes the other gods. <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[1039](#fn_1038)   And for those who wish to do
things not to be spoken of, he begat Metis, and devoured her.  But Metis
was seed; for it is impossible to devour a child.  And for an excuse to
abusers of themselves with mankind, he carries away Ganymedes.  And as a
helper of adulterers in their adultery, he is often found an adulterer. 
And to those who wish to commit incest with sisters, he sets the example
in his intercourse with his sisters Hera and Demeter, and the heavenly
Aphrodite, whom some call Dodona. <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[1040](#fn_1039)   And to those who wish to commit
incest with their daughters, there is a wicked example from his story,
in his committing incest with Persephone.  But in myriads of instances
he acted impiously, that by reason of his excessive wickedness the fable
of his being a god might be received by impious men.

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p3"></span> Wieseler proposes <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p3.1"></span>θείους</span> instead
of <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p3.2"></span>θεούς</span>; and he punishes his uncles
also , as in vi. 2, 21.

<span id="fn_1039"></span>[254:1040](0080777.htm#fr_1039) <span
id="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p3.3"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.vii.xvi-p4"></span> This is properly regarded as a
mistake for Dione, or Didone, which is another form of the name Dione.
