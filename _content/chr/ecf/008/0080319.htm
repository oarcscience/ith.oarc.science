<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.vii.v-p2"></A>&#8220;Wherefore we must, above all things, hasten to the knowledge of the truth, that, as with a light kindled thereat, we may be able to dispel the darkness of errors:&#160; for ignorance, as we have said, is a great evil; but because it has no substance, it is easily dispelled by those who are in earnest.&#160; For ignorance is nothing else than not knowing what is good for us; once know this, and ignorance perishes.&#160; Therefore the knowledge of truth ought to be eagerly sought after; and no one can confer it except the true Prophet.&#160; For this is the gate of life to those who will enter, and the road of good works to those going to the city of salvation.</p>
