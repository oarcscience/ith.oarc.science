<span id="vi.iv.vi.x-p2"></span>“Therefore Simon, who is going to
discuss in public with us to-morrow, is bold against the monarchy of
God, wishing to produce many statements from these Scriptures, to the
effect that there are many gods, and a certain one who is not He who
made this world, but who is superior to Him; and, at the same time, he
is going to offer many scriptural proofs.  But we also can easily show
many passages from them that He who made the world alone is God, and
that there is none other besides Him.  But if any one shall wish to
speak otherwise, he also shall be able to produce proofs from them at
his pleasure.  For the Scriptures say all manner of things, that no one
of those who inquire ungratefully may find the truth, but simply what he
wishes to find, the truth being reserved for the grateful now gratitude
is to preserve our love to Him who is the cause of our being.
