id="vi.iv.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI.—Doctrine of
Conjunction.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi.xvi-p2"></span>“However, there are many proclaimers
of error, having one chief, even the chief of wickedness, just as the
Prophet of truth, being one, and being also the chief of piety, shall in
His own times have as His prophets all who are found pure.  But the
chief cause of men being deceived is this, their not understanding
beforehand the doctrine of conjunction, which I shall not fail to
expound to you in private every day, summarily; for it were too long to
speak in detail.  Be you therefore to me truth-loving judges of the
things that are spoken.
