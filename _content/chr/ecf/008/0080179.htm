<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xlii-p2"></A>&#8220;Therefore the name <i>God</i> is applied in three ways:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_641"></A><A HREF="#fn_641"><FONT SIZE="1">642</FONT></A>
&#160; either because he to whom it is given is truly God, or because he is the servant of him who is truly; and for the honour of the sender, that his authority may be full, he that is sent is <A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.iv.xlii-Page_109"></A>called by the name of him who sends, as is often done in respect of angels:&#160; for when they appear to a man, if he is a wise and intelligent man, he asks the name of him who appears to him, that he may acknowledge at once the honour of the sent, and the authority of the sender.&#160; For every nation has an angel, to whom God has committed the government of that nation; and when one of these appears, although he be thought and called God by those over whom he presides, yet, being asked, he does not give such testimony to himself.&#160; For the Most High God, who alone holds the power of all things, has divided all the nations of the earth into seventy-two parts, and over these He hath appointed angels as princes.&#160; But to the one among the archangels who is greatest, was committed the government of those who, before all others, received the worship and knowledge of the Most High God.&#160; But holy men also, as we have said, are made gods to the wicked, as having received the power of life and death over them, as we mentioned above with respect to Moses and the judges.&#160; Wherefore it is also written concerning them, &#145;Thou shalt not curse the gods, and thou shalt not curse the prince of thy people.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_642"></A><A HREF="#fn_642"><FONT SIZE="1">643</FONT></A>
&#160; Thus the princes of the several nations are called gods.&#160; But Christ is God of princes, who is Judge of all.&#160; Therefore neither angels, nor men, nor any creature, can be truly gods, forasmuch as they are placed under authority, being created and changeable:&#160; angels, for they were not, and are; men, for they are mortal; and every creature, for it is capable of dissolution, if only He dissolve it who made it.&#160; And therefore He alone is the true God, who not only Himself lives, but also bestows life upon others, which He can also take away when it pleaseth Him.</p>
