<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p2"></A>And Peter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1234"></A><A HREF="#fn_1234"><FONT SIZE="1">1235</FONT></A>
 said:&#160; &#8220;Are not those, then, who you said received injustice, themselves transgressors, inasmuch as they are in the kingdom of the other, and is it not by overreaching that they have obtained all they possess? while those who are thought to act unjustly are conferring a favour on each subject of the hostile kingdom, so far as they permit him to have property.&#160; For these possessions belong to those who have chosen the present.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1235"></A><A HREF="#fn_1235"><FONT SIZE="1">1236</FONT></A>
&#160; And they are so far kind as to permit the others to live.&#160; This, then, is the parable; now listen to the actual truth.&#160; The prophet of the truth who appeared <i>on earth</i> taught us that the Maker and God of all gave two kingdoms to two,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1236"></A><A HREF="#fn_1236"><FONT SIZE="1">1237</FONT></A>
 good and evil; granting to the evil the sovereignty over the present world along with law, so that he, <i>it</i>, should have the right to punish those who act unjustly; but to the good He gave the eternal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1237"></A><A HREF="#fn_1237"><FONT SIZE="1">1238</FONT></A>
 to come.&#160; But He made each man free with the power to give himself up to whatsoever he prefers, either to the present evil or the future good.&#160; Those men who choose the present have power to be rich, to revel in luxury, to indulge in pleasures, and to do whatever they can.&#160; For they will possess none of the future goods.&#160; But those who have determined to accept the blessings of the future reign have no right to regard as their own the things that are here, since they belong to a foreign king, with the exception only of water and bread, and those things procured with sweat to maintain life (for it is not lawful for them to commit suicide),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1238"></A><A HREF="#fn_1238"><FONT SIZE="1">1239</FONT></A>
 and also one garment, for they are not permitted to go naked on account of the all-seeing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1239"></A><A HREF="#fn_1239"><FONT SIZE="1">1240</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p3"></A> The following words would be more appropriately put in the mouth of the father, as is done in fact by the <i>Epitomes</i>.&#160; Peter&#146;s address would commence, &#8220;And the parable is.&#8221;&#160; The <i>Epitomes</i> differ much from each other and the text, and there seems to be confusion in the text.</p>
