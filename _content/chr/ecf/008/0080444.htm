<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xxxviii-p2"></A>To these counsels of Peter we willingly assented, saying to him that we should do nothing but what was pleasing to him.&#160; Then said he:&#160; &#8220;That you may therefore be exercised without danger, each of you conduct the discussion in my presence, one succeeding another, and each one elucidating his own questions.&#160; Now, then, as Niceta discoursed sufficiently yesterday, let Aquila conduct the discussion to-day; and after Aquila, Clement; and then I, if the case shall require it, will add something.&#8221;&#160; Meantime, while we were talking in this way, we came to the house; and the master of the house welcomed us, and led us to a certain apartment, arranged after the manner of a theatre, and beautifully built.&#160; There we found great crowds waiting for us, who had come during the night, and amongst them the old man who had argued with us yesterday.&#160; Therefore we entered, having Peter in the midst of us, looking about if we could see the old man anywhere; and when Peter saw him hiding in the midst of the crowd, he called him to him, saying:&#160; &#8220;Since you possess a soul more enlightened than most, why do you hide yourself, and conceal yourself in modesty?&#160; Rather come hither, and propound your sentiments.&#8221;</p>
