id="vi.iv.x.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—The Golden Rule.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.x.iv-p2"></span>“Wherefore, as then ye were deceived by
the forerunner Simon, and so became dead in your souls to God, and were
smitten in your bodies; so now, if you repent, as I said, and submit to
those things which are well-pleasing to God, you may get new strength to
your bodies, and recover your soul’s health.  And the things which are
well-pleasing to God are these:  to pray to Him, to ask from Him,
recognising that He is the giver of all things, and gives with
discriminating law; to abstain from the table of devils, not to taste
dead flesh, not to touch blood; to be washed from all pollution; and the
rest in one word,—as the God-fearing Jews have heard, do you also hear,
and be of one mind in many bodies; let each man be minded to do to his
neighbour those good things he wishes for himself.  And you may all find
out what is good, by holding some such conversation as the following
with yourselves:  You would not like to be murdered; do not murder
another man:  you would not like your wife to be seduced by another; do
not you commit adultery:  you would not like any of your things to be
stolen from you; steal nothing from another.  And so understanding by
yourselves what is reasonable, and doing it, you will become dear to
God, and will obtain healing; otherwise in the life which now is your
bodies will be tormented, and in that which is to come your souls will
be punished.” <span id="fr_1080"></span>[1081](#fn_1080)

compare *Recognitions*, ii. 6–18.  But the statements respecting Simon’s
power and the design of it are much stronger than here.—R.\]
