<span id="vii.v.xi-p2"></span>While these things were doing, Joseph was
occupied with his work, house-building, in the districts by the
sea-shore; for he was a carpenter.  And after nine months he came back
to his house, and found Mary pregnant.  Wherefore, being in the utmost
distress, he trembled and cried out, saying:  O Lord God, receive my
spirit; for it is better for me to die than to live any longer.  And the
virgins who were with Mary said to him:  Joseph, what art thou saying? 
We know that no man has touched her; we can testify that she is still a
virgin, and untouched.  We have watched over her; always has she
continued with us in prayer; daily do the angels of God speak with her;
daily does she receive food from the hand of the Lord.  We know not how
it is possible that there can be any sin in her.  But if thou wishest us
to tell thee what we suspect, nobody but the angel of the Lord <span
id="fr_1638"></span>[1639](#fn_1638) has made her pregnant.  Then said
Joseph:  Why do you mislead me, to believe that an angel of the Lord has
made her pregnant?  But it is possible that some one has pretended to be
an angel of the Lord, and has beguiled her.  And thus speaking, he wept,
and said:  With what face shall I look at the temple of the Lord, or
with what face shall I see the priests of God?  What am I to do?  And
thus saying, he thought that he would flee, and send her away.
