<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vi.xxxvii-p2"></A>But if thou art thankful, O man, understanding that God is thy benefactor in all things, thou mayest even be immortal, the things that are made for thee having continuance through thy gratitude.&#160; And now thou art able to become incorruptible, if thou acknowledge Him whom thou didst not know, if thou love Him whom thou didst forsake, if thou pray to Him alone who is able to punish or to save thy body and soul.&#160; Wherefore, before all things, consider that no one shares His rule, no one has a name in common with Him&#8212;that is, is called God.&#160; For He alone is both called and is God.&#160; Nor is it lawful to think that there is any other, or to call any other by that name.&#160; And if any one should dare do so, eternal punishment of soul is his.&#8221;</p>
