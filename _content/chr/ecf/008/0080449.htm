<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.xliii-p2"></A>&#8220;If, then, it seems to you that this is so, and what has been said on this subject is enough, let us come to inquire into other matters; or if you think that something is still wanting, let us go over it again.&#8221;&#160; And the old man said:&#160; &#8220;I wish <A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.x.xliii-Page_177"></A>you would go over this again, since there are many other things which I see to be made in like manner:&#160; for both the fruits of trees are produced in like manner, beautifully formed and wonderfully rounded; and the appearance of the leaves is formed with immense gracefulness, and the green membrane is woven with exquisite art:&#160; then, moreover, fleas, mice, lizards, and such like, shall we say that these are made by God?&#160; Hence, from these vile objects a conjecture is derived concerning the superior, that they are by no means formed by the art of mind.&#8221;&#160; &#8220;You infer well,&#8221; said Aquila, &#8220;concerning the texture of leaves, and concerning small animals, that from these belief is withdrawn from the superior creatures; but let not these things deceive you, that you should think that God, working as it were only with two hands, could not complete all things that are made; but remember how my brother Niceta answered you yesterday, and truly disclosed the mystery before the time, as a son speaking with his father, and explained why and how things are made which seem to be useless.&#8221;</p>
