<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.v.xli-p2"></A>Then I Clement, hearing this, said:&#160; &#8220;Truly I rejoice, and I give thanks to God, who in all things doeth well.&#160; However, he knows that I shall be able to think nothing other than that all <A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.v.xli-Page_237"></A>things are for God.&#160; Wherefore do not suppose that I ask questions, as doubting the words concerning God,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_947"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">948</FONT></A>
 or those that are to be spoken, but rather that I may learn, and so be able myself to instruct another who is ingenuously willing to learn.&#160; Wherefore tell me what are the falsehoods added to the Scriptures, and how it comes that they are really false.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter answered:&#160; &#8220;Even although you had not asked me, I should have gone on in order, and afforded you the exposition of these matters, as I promised.&#160; Learn, then, how the Scriptures misrepresent Him in many respects, that you may know when you happen upon them.</p>
