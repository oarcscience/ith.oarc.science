id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—His Distress.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.ii-p2"></span>While I was continually revolving in
my mind these and such like questions, suggested I know not how, I was
pining away wonderfully through excess of grief; and, what was worse, if
at any time I thought to cast aside such cares, as being of little use,
the waves of anxiety rose all the higher upon me.  For I had in me that
most excellent companion, who would not suffer me to rest—the desire of
immortality:  for, as the subsequent issue showed, and the grace of
Almighty God directed, this bent of mind led me to the quest of truth,
and the acknowledgment of the true light; and hence it came to pass,
that ere long I pitied those whom formerly in my ignorance I believed to
be happy.
