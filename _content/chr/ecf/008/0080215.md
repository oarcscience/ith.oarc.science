<span id="vi.iii.v.v-p2"></span>Then said Simon:  “You seem to me to be
angry; but if it be so, it is not necessary to enter into the
conflict.”  Then Peter:  “I see that you perceive that you are to be
convicted, and you wish politely to escape from the contest; for what
have you seen to have made me angry against you, a man desiring to
deceive so great a multitude, and when you have nothing to say,
pretending moderation, who also command, forsooth, by your authority
that the controversy shall be conducted as you please, and not as order
demands?”  Then Simon:  “I shall enforce myself to bear patiently your
unskilfulness, that I may show that you indeed wish to seduce the
people, but that I teach the truth.  But now I refrain from a discussion
concerning that boundless light.  Answer me, therefore, what I ask of
you.  Since God, as you say, made all things, whence comes evil?” <span

in this way is not the part of an opponent, but of a learner.  If
therefore you wish to learn, confess it; and I shall first teach you how
you ought to learn, and when you have learned to listen, then
straightway I shall begin to teach you.  But if you do not wish to
learn, as though you knew all things, I shall first set forth the faith
which I preach, and do you also set forth what you think to be true; and
when the profession of each of us has been disclosed, let our hearers
judge whose discourse is supported by truth.”  To this Simon answered: 
“This is a good joke:  behold a fellow who offers to teach me! 
Nevertheless I shall suffer you, and bear with your ignorance and your
arrogance.  I confess, then, I do wish to learn; let us see how you can
teach me.”

Simon is respecting the existence of the evil one.  Here the treatment
is apparently of a higher philosophical character.—R.\]
