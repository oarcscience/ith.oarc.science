<p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xxx-p2"></A>Then Joseph trembled, and took hold of Jesus, and went with Him to his own house, and His mother with Him.&#160; And, behold, suddenly from the opposite direction a boy, also a worker of iniquity, ran up and came against the shoulder of Jesus, wishing to make sport of Him, or to hurt Him, if he could.&#160; And Jesus said to him:&#160; Thou shalt not go back safe and sound from the way that thou goest.&#160; And immediately he fell down, and died.&#160; And the parents of the dead boy, who had seen what happened, cried out, saying:&#160; Where does this child come from?&#160; It is manifest that every word that he says is true; and it is often accomplished before he speaks.&#160; And the parents of the dead boy came to Joseph, and said to him:&#160; Take away that Jesus from this place, for he cannot live with us in this town; or at least teach him to bless, and not to curse.&#160; And Joseph came up to Jesus, and admonished Him, saying:&#160; Why doest thou such things?&#160; For already many are in grief <A NAME="page_379"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 379</FONT></A> <a name="vii.v.xxx-Page_379"></A>and against thee, and hate us on thy account, and we endure the reproaches of men because of thee.&#160; And Jesus answered and said unto Joseph:&#160; No one is a wise son but he whom his father hath taught, according to the knowledge of this time; and a father&#146;s curse can hurt none but evil-doers.&#160; Then they came together against Jesus, and accused him to Joseph.&#160; When Joseph saw this, he was in great terror, fearing the violence and uproar of the people of Israel.&#160; And the same hour Jesus seized the dead boy by the ear, and lifted him up from the earth in the sight of all:&#160; and they saw Jesus speaking to him like a father to his son.&#160; And his spirit came back to him, and he revived.&#160; And all of them wondered.</p>
