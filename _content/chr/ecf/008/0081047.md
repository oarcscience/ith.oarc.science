<span id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—The Explanation of a
Parable; The Present and the Future Life.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p2"></span>And Peter <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234) said:  “Are not those, then, who
you said received injustice, themselves transgressors, inasmuch as they
are in the kingdom of the other, and is it not by overreaching that they
have obtained all they possess? while those who are thought to act
unjustly are conferring a favour on each subject of the hostile kingdom,
so far as they permit him to have property.  For these possessions
belong to those who have chosen the present. <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235)   And they are so far kind as to
permit the others to live.  This, then, is the parable; now listen to
the actual truth.  The prophet of the truth who appeared *on earth*
taught us that the Maker and God of all gave two kingdoms to two, <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236) good and evil; granting to the evil
the sovereignty over the present world along with law, so that he, *it*,
should have the right to punish those who act unjustly; but to the good
He gave the eternal <span id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237) to come. 
But He made each man free with the power to give himself up to
whatsoever he prefers, either to the present evil or the future good. 
Those men who choose the present have power to be rich, to revel in
luxury, to indulge in pleasures, and to do whatever they can.  For they
will possess none of the future goods.  But those who have determined to
accept the blessings of the future reign have no right to regard as
their own the things that are here, since they belong to a foreign king,
with the exception only of water and bread, and those things procured
with sweat to maintain life (for it is not lawful for them to commit
suicide), <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238) and also one
garment, for they are not permitted to go naked on account of the
all-seeing <span id="fr_1239"></span>[1240](#fn_1239) Heaven.

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[310:1235](0081047.htm#fr_1234) <span
id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p3"></span> The following words would be more
appropriately put in the mouth of the father, as is done in fact by the
*Epitomes*.  Peter’s address would commence, “And the parable is.”  The
*Epitomes* differ much from each other and the text, and there seems to
be confusion in the text.

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[310:1236](0081047.htm#fr_1235) <span
id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p4"></span> This sentence would be more
appropriate in the explanation of the parable.

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[310:1237](0081047.htm#fr_1236) <span
id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p5"></span> The Greek leaves it uncertain
whether it is two persons or two things,—whether it is a good being and
an evil being, or good and evil.  Afterwards, a good being and an evil
are distinctly introduced.

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[310:1238](0081047.htm#fr_1237) <span
id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p6"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p6.1"></span>ἀΐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p6.2"></span>διος</span>, properly and strictly
“eternal,” is used.

<span id="fn_1238"></span>[310:1239](0081047.htm#fr_1238) <span
id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p6.3"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p7"></span> Lit., “to die willingly.”

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[310:1240](0081047.htm#fr_1239) <span
id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p8"></span> We have adopted an obvious
emendation, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p8.1"></span>πάντα</span> for <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xviii.vii-p8.2"></span>παντός</span>.
