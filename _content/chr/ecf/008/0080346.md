id="vi.iii.vii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.—True Religion Calls to
Sobriety and Modesty.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxxii-p2"></span>“But I protest to you with the
clear voice of preaching, that, on the contrary, the religion of God
calls you to sobriety and modesty; orders you to refrain from effeminacy
and madness, and by patience and gentleness to prevent the inroads of
anger; to be content with your own possessions, and with the virtue of
frugality; not even when driven by poverty to plunder the goods of
others, but in all things to observe justice; to withdraw yourselves
wholly from the idol sacrifices:  for by these things you invite demons
to you, and of your own accord give them the power of entering into you;
and so you admit that which is the cause either of madness or of
unlawful love.
