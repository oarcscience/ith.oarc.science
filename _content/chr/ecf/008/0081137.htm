<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-p2"></A>And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;What you state is impossible; for if he came into existence by degrees, <A NAME="page_336"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 336</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xxii.xviii-Page_336"></A>He could have cut him off as a foe by His own free choice.&#160; And knowing beforehand that he was coming into existence, He would not have allowed him as a good, had He not known that by reason of him what was useful was being brought into existence.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1446"></A><A HREF="#fn_1446"><FONT SIZE="1">1447</FONT></A>
&#160; And he could not have come into existence suddenly, complete, of his own power.&#160; For he who did not exist could not fashion himself; and he neither could become complete out of nothing, nor could any one justly say that he had substance,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1447"></A><A HREF="#fn_1447"><FONT SIZE="1">1448</FONT></A>
 so as always to be equal in power if he were begotten.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Is he then a mere relation, and in this way wicked?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1448"></A><A HREF="#fn_1448"><FONT SIZE="1">1449</FONT></A>
&#8212;being injurious, as water is injurious to fire, but good for the seasonably thirsty land; as iron is good for the cultivation of the land, but bad for murders; and lust is not evil in respect of marriage, but bad in respect of adultery; as murder is an evil, but good for the murderer so far as his purpose is concerned; and cheating is an evil, but pleasant to the man who cheats; and other things of a like character are good and bad in like manner.&#160; In this way, neither is evil, nor good; for the one produces the other.&#160; For does not that which seems to be done injuriously rejoice the doer, but punish the sufferer?&#160; And though it seems unjust that a man should, out of self-love, gratify himself by every means in his power, to whom, on the other hand, does it not seem unjust that a man should suffer severe punishments at the hand of a just judge for having loved himself?&#8221;</p>
