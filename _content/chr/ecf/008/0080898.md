<span id="vi.iv.xii.xv-p2"></span>“For as dire serpents draw sparrows to
them by their breath, so also these draw to their own will those who
partake of their table, being mixed up with their understanding by means
of food and drink, changing themselves in dreams according to the forms
of the images, that they may increase error.  For the image is neither a
living creature, nor has it a divine spirit, but the demon that appeared
abused the form. <span id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115)   How many,
in like manner, have been seen by others in dreams; and when they have
met one another when awake, and compared them with what they saw in
their dream, they have not accorded:  so that the dream is not a
manifestation, but is either the production of a demon or of the soul,
giving forms to present fears and desire.  For the soul, being struck
with fear, conceives forms in dreams.  But if you think that images, as
being alive, can accomplish such things, place them on a beam accurately
balanced, and place an equipoise in the other scale, then ask them to
become either heavier or lighter:  and if this be done, then they are
alive.  But it does not so happen.  But if it were so, this would not
prove them to be gods.  For this might be accomplished by the finger of
the demon.  Even maggots move, yet they are not called gods.

<span id="vi.iv.xii.xv-p3"></span> The meaning is:  “the idols or images
of the heathen deities are not living, but the demons adopt the forms of
these images when they appear to men in dreams.”
