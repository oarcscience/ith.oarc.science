<span id="vii.xvi.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xvi.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 8 (24).</span>

<span id="vii.xvi.viii-p2"></span>And the Lord stretched out His hand,
and said:  Come to me, all my saints, who have my image and likeness. 
Do you, who have been condemned through the tree and the devil and
death, now see the devil and death condemned through the tree. 
Immediately all the saints were brought together under the hand of the
Lord.  And the Lord, holding Adam by the right hand, said to him:  Peace
be to thee, with all thy children, my righteous ones!  And Adam fell
down at the knees of the Lord, and with tearful entreaty praying, said
with a loud voice:  I will extol Thee, O Lord; for Thou hast lifted me
up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.  O Lord God, I cried
unto Thee, and Thou hast healed me.  O Lord, Thou hast brought out my
soul from the powers below; Thou hast saved me from them that go down
into the pit.  Sing praises to the Lord, all His saints, and confess to
the memory of His holiness; since there is anger in His indignation, and
life in His goodwill. <span id="fr_1986"></span>[1987](#fn_1986)   In
like manner also all the saints of God, falling on their knees at the
feet of the Lord, said with one voice:  Thou hast come, O Redeemer of
the world:  as Thou hast foretold by the law and Thy prophets, so hast
Thou fulfilled by Thy deeds.  Thou hast redeemed the living by Thy
cross; and by the death of the cross Thou hast come down to us, to
rescue us from the powers below, and from death, by Thy majesty.  O
Lord, as Thou hast set the title of Thy glory in heaven, and hast
erected as the title of redemption Thy cross upon earth, so, O Lord, set
in Hades the sign of the victory of Thy cross, that death may no more
have dominion.

<span id="vii.xvi.viii-p4"></span>And the Lord, stretching forth His
hand, made the sign of the cross upon Adam and upon all His saints; and
holding Adam by the right hand, went up from the powers below:  and all
the saints followed Him.  Then holy David cried out aloud, saying:  Sing
unto the Lord a new song, for He hath done wonderful things; His right
hand and His holy arm have brought salvation to Himself.  The Lord hath
made known His salvation; His righteousness hath He revealed in the
sight of the heathen. <span id="fr_1987"></span>[1988](#fn_1987)   And
all the multitude of the saints answered, saying:  This is glory to all
His saints.  Amen, alleluia.

<span id="vii.xvi.viii-p6"></span>And after this the prophet Habacuc
cried out, saying:  Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people,
to deliver Thine elect. <span id="fr_1988"></span>[1989](#fn_1988)   And
all the saints answered, saying:  Blessed is He who <span
id="page_452">p. 452</span> <span
id="vii.xvi.viii-Page_452"></span>cometh in the name of the Lord; God is
the Lord, and He hath shone upon us. <span
id="fr_1989"></span>[1990](#fn_1989)   Amen, alleluia.  In like manner
after this the prophet Michæas as also cried out, saying:  Who is a God
like unto thee, O Lord, taking away iniquities and passing by sins?  And
now Thou dost withhold Thine anger for a testimony *against us*, because
Thou delightest in mercy.  And Thou turnest again, and hast compassion
upon us, and pardonest all our iniquities; and all our sins hast Thou
sunk in the multitude of death, <span
id="fr_1990"></span>[1991](#fn_1990) as Thou hast sworn unto our fathers
in the days of old. <span id="fr_1991"></span>[1992](#fn_1991)   And all
the saints answered, saying:  This is our God to eternity, and for ever
and ever; and He will direct us for evermore. <span
id="fr_1992"></span>[1993](#fn_1992)   Amen, alleluia.  So also all the
prophets, quoting the sacred *writings* concerning His praises, <span
id="fr_1993"></span>[1994](#fn_1993) and all the saints crying, Amen,
alleluia, followed the Lord.
