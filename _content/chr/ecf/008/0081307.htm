<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xv.vii-p2"></A>And of the Jews a certain other one, starting up, asks the governor that he might say a word.&#160; The governor says:&#160; What thou wishest to say, say.&#160; And he said:&#160; For thirty-eight years I lay in infirmity in my bed in very grievous pain.&#160; And at the coming of Jesus, many demoniacs, and <i>persons</i> held down by divers infirmities, were healed by him.&#160; And some young men had pity on me; and carrying me in my bed, laid me before him.&#160; And Jesus, seeing, had pity on me, and said the word to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.&#160; And immediately I was made whole; I took up my bed, and walked.&#160; The Jews say to Pilate:&#160; Ask him what was the day on which he was healed.&#160; He said:&#160; The Sabbath.&#160; The Jews say:&#160; Have we not so informed thee, that on the Sabbath he heals, and drives out demons?</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xv.vii-p3"></A>And a certain other Jew starting up, said:&#160; I was born blind; I heard a voice, and saw no man.&#160; And as Jesus was passing by, I cried out with a loud voice, Have pity upon me, thou son of David.&#160; And he had pity upon me, and laid his hands upon my eyes, and I saw immediately.&#160; And another Jew starting up, said:&#160; I was hunchbacked, and he straightened me with a word.&#160; And another said:&#160; I was leprous, and he healed me with a word.</p>
