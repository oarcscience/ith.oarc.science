id="vi.iii.v.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIX.—Arrangements Approved by All
the Brethren.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.lix-p2"></span>Having therefore separated me,
Clement, and Niceta and Aquila, he said to those twelve:  “I wish you
the day after to-morrow to proceed to the Gentiles, and to follow in the
footsteps of Simon, that you may inform me of all his proceedings.  You
will also inquire diligently the sentiments of every one, and announce
to them that I shall come to them without delay; and, in short, in all
places instruct the Gentiles to expect my coming.”  When he had spoken
these things, and others to the same effect, he said:  “You also, my
brethren, if you have anything to say to these things, say on, lest
haply it be not right which seems good to me alone.”  Then all, with one
voice applauding him, said:  “We ask you rather to arrange everything
according to your own judgment, and to order what seems good to
yourself; for this we think to be the perfect work of piety, if we
fulfil what you command.”
