<p class="c35"><a name="x.v.xii-p2"></A><span class="c1"><a name="x.v.xii-p2.1"></A>From the Catena on Genesis.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3623"></A><A HREF="#fn_3623"><FONT SIZE="1">3624</FONT></A>

<p class="c21"><a name="x.v.xii-p4"></A>In place of Isaac the just, a ram appeared for slaughter, in order that Isaac might be liberated from <i>his</i> bonds.&#160; The slaughter of this <i>animal</i> redeemed Isaac <i>from death</i>.&#160; In like manner, the Lord, being slain, saved us; being bound, He loosed us; being sacrificed, He redeemed us&#8230;</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.xii-p5"></A>For the Lord was a lamb, like the ram which Abraham saw caught in the bush Sabec.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3624"></A><A HREF="#fn_3624"><FONT SIZE="1">3625</FONT></A>
&#160; But this bush represented the cross, and that place Jerusalem, and the lamb the Lord bound for slaughter.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.xii-p7"></A>For as a ram was He bound, says he concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, and as a lamb was He shorn, and as a sheep was He led to the slaughter, and as a lamb was He crucified; and He carried the cross&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3625"></A><A HREF="#fn_3625"><FONT SIZE="1">3626</FONT></A>
 on His shoulders when He was led up <i>to the hill</i> to be slain, as was Isaac by his father.&#160; But Christ suffered, and Isaac did not suffer:&#160; for he was <i>but</i> a type of Him who should suffer.&#160; Yet, even when serving <i>only</i> for a type of Christ, he smote men with astonishment and fear.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="x.v.xii-p9"></A>For a new mystery was presented to view,&#8212;a son led by his father to a mountain to be slain, whose feet he bound together, and laid him on the wood of the sacrifice, preparing with care&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3626"></A><A HREF="#fn_3626"><FONT SIZE="1">3627</FONT></A>
 whatever was necessary to his immolation.&#160; Isaac on his part is silent, bound like a ram, not opening his mouth, nor uttering a sound with his voice.&#160; For, not fearing the knife, nor quailing before the fire, nor troubled by <i>the prospect of</i> suffering, he sustained bravely <i>the character of</i> the type of the Lord.&#160; Accordingly there lies <A NAME="page_760"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 760</FONT></A> <a name="x.v.xii-Page_760"></A>Isaac before us, with his feet bound like a ram, his father standing by, with the knife all bare in his hand, not shrinking from shedding the blood of his son.</p>
