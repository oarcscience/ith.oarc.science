id="vii.xiii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter 12.</span>

<span id="vii.xiii.xiii-p2"></span>When the Jews were made acquainted
with these things done by Joseph and Nicodemus, they were greatly
stirred up against them.  And the chief priests Annas and Caiaphas sent
for Joseph, and said:  Why hast thou done this service to Jesus?  Joseph
says:  I know that Jesus was a man just, and true, and good in all
respects; and I know also that you, through hatred, managed to murder
him:  and therefore I buried him.  Then the high priests were enraged,
and laid hold of Joseph, and threw him into prison, and said to him:  If
we had not to-morrow the feast of unleavened bread, tomorrow also should
we have put thee, like him, to death; but being kept in the meantime,
early in the morning of the Lord’s day <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918) thou shalt be given up to death. 
Thus they spoke, and affixed their seal to the prison, having secured it
by fastenings of all sorts.

<span id="vii.xiii.xiii-p4"></span>Thus, therefore, when the Preparation
was ended, early on the Sabbath the Jews went away to Pilate, and said
to him:  My lord, that deceiver said, that after three days he should
rise again.  Lest, therefore, his disciples should steal him by night,
and lead the people astray by such deceit, order his tomb to be
guarded.  Pilate therefore, upon this, gave them five hundred soldiers,
who also sat round the sepulchre so as to guard it, after having put
seals upon the stone of the tomb. <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919)

<span id="vii.xiii.xiii-p6"></span>The Lord’s day, then, having dawned,
the chief priests, along with the Jews, called a council, and sent to
take Joseph out of the prison, in order to put him to death.  But having
opened it, they found him not.  And they were astonished at this—how,
with the doors shut, and the bolts safe, and the seals unbroken, Joseph
had disappeared.
