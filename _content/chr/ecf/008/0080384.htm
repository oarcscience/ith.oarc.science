<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xvii-p2"></A>&#8220;But when the day dawned, and I with shouting and howling was looking around, if I could even see the corpses of my unhappy sons anywhere washed ashore, some of those who saw me were moved with compassion, and searched, first over the sea, and then also along the shores, if they could find either of my children.&#160; But when neither of them was anywhere found, the women of the place, taking pity on me, began to comfort me, every one telling her own griefs, that I might take consolation from the likeness of their calamities to my own.&#160; But this saddened me all the more; for my disposition was not such that I could regard the misfortunes of others as comforts to me.&#160; And when many desired to receive me hospitably, a certain poor woman who dwells here constrained me to enter into her hut, saying that she had had a husband who was a sailor, and that he had died at sea while a young man, and that, although many afterwards asked her in marriage, she preferred widowhood through love of her husband.&#160; &#145;Therefore,&#146; said she, &#145;we shall share whatever we can gain by the labour of our hands.&#146;</p>
