<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.xiii-p2"></A>&#8220;Let the catechists instruct, being first instructed; for it is a work relating to the souls of men.&#160; For the teacher of the word must accommodate himself to the various judgments of the learners.&#160; The catechists must therefore be learned, and unblameable, of much experience, and approved, as you will know that Clement is, who is to be your instructor after me.&#160; For it were too much for me now to go into details.&#160; However, if ye be of one mind, you shall be able to reach the haven of rest, where is the peaceful city of the great King.</p>
