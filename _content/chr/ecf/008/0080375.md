History.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.ix.viii-p2"></span>Then said Peter:  “Is there then no
one of your family surviving?”  I answered:  “There are indeed many
powerful men, coming of the stock of Cæsar; for Cæsar himself gave a
wife to my father, as being his relative, and educated along with him,
and of a suitably noble family.  By her my father had twin sons, born
before me, not very like one another, as my father told me; for I never
knew them.  But indeed I have not a distinct recollection even of my
mother; but I cherish the remembrance of her face, as if I had seen it
in a dream.  My mother’s name was Matthidia, my father’s Faustinianus: 
my brothers’, Faustinus and Faustus. <span

old, my mother saw a vision—so I learned from my father—by which she was
warned that, unless she speedily left the city with her twin sons, and
was absent for ten years, she and her children should perish by a
miserable fate.
