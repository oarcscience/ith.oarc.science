<p class="c21"><a name="vii.x.xv-p2"></A>A few days after, a child, His neighbour, died, and his mother mourned for him sore.&#160; Jesus, hearing this, went and stood over the boy, and knocked upon his breast, and said:&#160; I say to thee, child, do not die, but live.&#160; And immediately the child rose up.&#160; And Jesus said to the boy&#146;s mother:&#160; Take thy son, and give him the breast, and remember me.&#160; And the crowd, seeing this miracle, said:&#160; In truth, this child is from heaven; for already has he freed many souls from death, and he has made whole all that hope in him.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.x.xv-p3"></A>The scribes and Pharisees said to Mary:&#160; Art thou the mother of this child?&#160; And Mary said:&#160; Indeed I am.&#160; And they said to her:&#160; Blessed art thou among women,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1774"></A><A HREF="#fn_1774"><FONT SIZE="1">1775</FONT></A>
 since God hath blessed the fruit of thy womb, seeing that He hath given thee such a glorious child, and such a gift of wisdom, as we have never seen nor heard of.&#160; Jesus rose up and followed His mother.&#160; And Mary kept in her heart all the great miracles that Jesus had done among the people, in healing many that were diseased.&#160; And Jesus grew in stature and wisdom; and all who saw Him glo<A NAME="page_404"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 404</FONT></A> <a name="vii.x.xv-Page_404"></A>rified God the Father Almighty, who is blessed for ever and ever.&#160; Amen.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.x.xv-p5"></A>And all these things I Thomas the Israelite have written what I have seen, and have recounted them to the Gentiles and to our brethren, and many other things done by Jesus, who was born in the land of Judah.&#160; Behold, the house of Israel has seen all, from the first even to the last; how great signs and wonders Jesus did among them, which were exceedingly good, and invisible to their father,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1775"></A><A HREF="#fn_1775"><FONT SIZE="1">1776</FONT></A>
 as holy Scripture relates, and the prophets have borne witness to His works in all the peoples of Israel.&#160; And He it is who is to judge the world according to the will of immortality, since He is the Son of God throughout all the world.&#160; To Him is due all glory and honour for ever, who lives and reigns God through all ages of ages.&#160; Amen.</p>
