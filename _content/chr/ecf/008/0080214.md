id="vi.iii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV.—Simon Claims the Fulfilment of
Peter’s Promise.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.v.iv-p2"></span>While Peter spoke these words, and
others to the same effect, Simon answered:  “I will not have you detain
me with long speeches, Peter; I claim from you what you promised
yesterday.  You then said that you could show that the law teaches
concerning the immensity of the eternal light, and that there are only
two heavens, and these created, and that the higher is the abode of that
light, in which the ineffable Father dwells alone for ever; but that
after the pattern of that heaven is made this visible heaven, which you
asserted is to pass away.  You said, therefore, that the Father of all
is one, because there cannot be two infinites; else neither of them
would be infinite, because in that in which the one subsists, he makes a
limit of the subsistence of the other.  Since then you not only promised
this, but are able to show it from the law, leave off other matters and
set about this.”  Then Peter said:  “If I were asked to speak of these
things only on your account, who come only for the purpose of
contradicting, you should never hear a single discourse from me; but
seeing it is necessary that the husbandman, wishing to sow good ground,
should sow some seeds, either in stony places, or places that are to be
trodden of men, or in places filled with brambles and briers (as our
Master also set forth, indicating by these the diversities of the
purposes of several souls), <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678) I
shall not delay.”
