id="vii.xiv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter 11 (27).</span>

<span id="vii.xiv.xi-p2"></span>All these things we saw and heard; we,
the two brothers, who also have been sent by Michael the archangel, and
have been ordered to proclaim the resurrection of the Lord, but first to
go away to the Jordan and to be baptized.  Thither also we have gone,
and have been baptized with the rest of the dead who have risen. 
Thereafter also we came to Jerusalem, and celebrated the passover of the
resurrection.  But now we are going away, being unable to stay here. 
And the love of God, even the Father, and the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. <span

<span id="vii.xiv.xi-p4"></span>Having written these things, and secured
the rolls, they gave the half to the chief priests, and the half to
Joseph and Nicodemus.  And they immediately disappeared:  to the glory
of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Amen.
