id="vi.iii.iv.lxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIX.—Faith and Reason.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.lxix-p2"></span>Then Peter:  “Do not think that we
say that these things are only to be received by faith, but also that
they are to be asserted by reason.  For indeed it is not safe to commit
these things to bare faith without reason, since assuredly truth cannot
be without reason.  And therefore he who has received these things
fortified by reason, can never lose them; whereas he who receives them
without proofs, by an assent to a simple statement of them, can neither
keep them safely, nor is certain if they are true; because he who easily
believes, also easily yields.  But he who has sought reason for those
things which he has believed and received, as though bound by chains of
reason itself, can never be torn away or separated from those things
which he hath believed.  And therefore, according as any one is more
anxious in demanding a reason, by so much will he be the firmer in
preserving his faith.”
