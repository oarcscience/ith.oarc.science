id="vi.iv.xiv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—“Behold What
Indignation.”</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xiv.iii-p2"></span>“But not otherwise will you endure to
undertake much care for your purification unless you be angry with
yourselves, and chastise yourselves for those things with which, as
unprofitable servants, you have been ensnared, consenting to your evil
lusts, that you may be able to let in your righteous indignation upon
your mind, as fire upon a fallow field.  If, therefore, ye have not
righteous fire, I mean indignation, against evil lusts, learn from what
good things ye have been seduced, and by whom ye have been deceived, and
for what punishment ye are prepared; and thus, your mind being sober,
and kindled into indignation like fire by the teaching of Him who sent
us, may be able to consume the evil things of lust.  Believe me, that if
you will, you can rectify all things.
