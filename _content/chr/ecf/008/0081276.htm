<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xiii.vi-p2"></A>A God-fearing Jew, therefore, Nicodemus by name, stood up in the midst, and said to Pilate:&#160; I entreat your highness to permit me to say a few words.&#160; Say on, said Pilate.&#160; Nicodemus says:&#160; I, being present in the synagogue, said to the priests, and the Levites, and the scribes, and the people, What have you to say against this man?&#160; This man does many miracles, such as man has never yet done nor will do.&#160; Let him go, therefore; and if indeed what he does be from God, it will stand; but if from man, it will be destroyed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1883"></A><A HREF="#fn_1883"><FONT SIZE="1">1884</FONT></A>
&#160; Just as happened also when God sent Moses into Egypt, and Pharoah king of Egypt told him to do a miracle, and he did it.&#160; Then Pharoah had also two magicians, Jannes and Jambres; and they also did miracles by the use of magic art, but not such as Moses did.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1884"></A><A HREF="#fn_1884"><FONT SIZE="1">1885</FONT></A>
&#160; And the Egyptians held these magicians to be gods; but because they were not from God, what they did was destroyed.&#160; This Jesus, then, raised up Lazarus, and he is alive.&#160; On this account I entreat thee, my lord, by no means to allow this man to be put to death.</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xiii.vi-p5"></A>The Hebrews were enraged against Nicodemus, and said:&#160; Mayst thou receive the truth of Jesus, and have a portion with him.&#160; Nicodemus says:&#160; Amen, amen; be it to me as you say.</p>
