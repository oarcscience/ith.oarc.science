<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.liii-p2"></A>While Peter was thus speaking, the day dawned; and, behold, one of the disciples of Simon came, crying out:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_708"></A><A HREF="#fn_708"><FONT SIZE="1">709</FONT></A>
&#160; &#8220;I beseech thee, O Peter, receive me, a wretch, who have been deceived by Simon the magician, to whom I gave heed as to a heavenly God, by reason of those miracles which I saw him perform.&#160; But when I heard your discourses, I began to think him a man, and indeed a wicked man; nevertheless, when he went out from this I alone followed him, for I had not yet clearly perceived his impieties.&#160; But when he saw me following him, he called me blessed, and led me to his house; and about the middle of the night he said to me, &#145;I shall make you better than all men, if you will remain with me even till the end.&#146;&#160; When I had promised him this, he demanded of me an oath of perseverance; and having got this, he placed upon my shoulders some of his polluted and accursed secret things, that I might carry them, and or<A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iii.v.liii-Page_131"></A>dered me to follow him.&#160; But when we came to the sea, he went aboard a boat which happened to be there, and took from my neck what he had ordered me to carry.&#160; And as he came out a little after, bringing nothing with him, he must have thrown it into the sea.&#160; Then he asked me to go with him, saying that he was going to Rome, and that there he would please the people so much, that he should be reckoned a god, and publicly gifted with divine honours.&#160; &#145;Then,&#146; said he, &#145;if you wish to return hither, I shall send you back, loaded with all riches, and upheld by various services.&#146;&#160; When I heard this, and saw nothing in him in accordance with this profession, but perceived that he was a magician and a deceiver, I answered:&#160; &#145;Pardon me, I pray you; for I have a pain in my feet, and therefore I am not able to leave C&aelig;sarea.&#160; Besides, I have a wife and little children, whom I cannot leave by any means.&#146;&#160; When he heard this, he charged me with sloth, and set out towards Dora, saying, &#145;You will be sorry, when you hear what glory I shall get in the city of Rome.&#146;&#160; And after this he set out for Rome, as he said; but I hastily returned hither, entreating you to receive me to penitence, because I have been deceived by him.&#8221;</p>
