<span id="vi.iv.vi.xl-p2"></span>In like manner Simon, by taking many
passages from the Scriptures, seemed to show that God is subject to
every infirmity.  And to this Peter said:  “Does he who is evil, and
wholly wicked, love to accuse himself in the things in which he sins? 
Answer me this.”  Then said Simon:  “He does not.”  Then said Peter: 
“How, then, can God be evil and wicked, seeing that those evil things
which have been commonly written regarding Him, have been added by His
own will!”  Then said Simon:  “It may be that the charge against Him is
written by another power, and not according to His choice.”  Then said
Peter:  “Let us then, in the first place, inquire into this.  If,
indeed, He has of His own will accused Himself, as you formerly
acknowledged, then He is not wicked; but if it is done by another power,
it must be inquired and investigated with all energy who hath subjected
to all evils Him who alone is good.”
