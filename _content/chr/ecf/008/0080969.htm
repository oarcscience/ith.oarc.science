<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxxv-p2"></A>Then after three months were fulfilled, he ordered me to fast for several days, and then brought me to the fountains that are near to the sea, and baptized me as in ever-flowing water.&#160; Thus, therefore, when our brethren rejoiced at my God-gifted regeneration, not many days after he turned to the elders in presence of all the church, and charged them, saying:&#160; &#8220;Our Lord and Prophet, who hath sent us, declared to us that the wicked one, having disputed with Him forty days, and having prevailed nothing against Him, promised that he would send apostles from amongst his subjects, to deceive.&#160; Wherefore, above all, remember to shun apostle or teacher or prophet who does not first accurately compare his preaching with <i>that of</i> James, who was called the brother of my Lord, and to whom was entrusted to administer the church of the Hebrews in Jerusalem,&#8212;and that even though he come to you with witnesses:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1138"></A><A HREF="#fn_1138"><FONT SIZE="1">1139</FONT></A>
&#160; lest the wickedness which disputed forty days with the Lord, and prevailed nothing, should afterwards, like lightning falling from heaven upon the earth, <A NAME="page_292"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 292</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xiv.xxxv-Page_292"></A>send a preacher to your injury, as now he has sent Simon upon us, preaching, under pretence of the truth, in the name of the Lord, and sowing error.&#160; Wherefore He who hath sent us, said, &#145;Many shall come to me in sheep&#146;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.&#160; By their fruits ye shall know them.&#146;&#8221;</p>
