<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.iii.xix-p2"></A>Having thus spoken, he laid his hands upon me in the presence of all, and compelled me to sit in his own chair.&#160; And when I was seated, he immediately said to me:&#160; &#8220;I entreat you, in the presence of all the brethren here, that whensoever I depart from this life, as depart I must, <A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.iii.xix-Page_222"></A>you send to James the brother of the Lord a brief account of your reasonings from your boyhood, and how from the beginning until now you have journeyed with me, hearing the discourses preached by me in every city, and <i>seeing</i> my deeds.&#160; And then at the end you will not fail to inform him of the manner of my death, as I said before.&#160; For that event will not grieve him very much, when he knows that I piously went through what it behoved me to suffer.&#160; And he will get the greatest comfort when he learns, that not an unlearned man, or one ignorant of life-giving words, or not knowing the rule of the Church, shall be entrusted with the chair of the teacher after me.&#160; For the discourse of a deceiver destroys the souls of the multitudes who hear.&#8221;</p>
