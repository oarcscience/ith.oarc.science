<span id="vi.iii.iii.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iii.xlv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLV.—The True Prophet:  Why
Called the Christ.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xlv-p2"></span>Then Peter began to instruct me in
this manner: <span id="fr_576"></span>[577](#fn_576)   “When God had
made the world, as Lord of the universe, He appointed chiefs over the
several creatures, over the trees even, and the mountains, and the
fountains, and the rivers, and all things which He had made, as we have
told you; for it were too long to mention them one by one.  He set,
therefore, an angel as chief over the angels, a spirit over the spirits,
a star over the stars, a demon over the demons, a bird over the birds, a
beast over the beasts, a serpent over the serpents, a fish over the
fishes, a man over men, who is Christ Jesus.  But He is called *Christ*
by a certain excellent rite of religion; for as there are certain names
common to kings, as Arsaces among the Persians, Cæsar among the Romans,
Pharaoh among the Egyptians, so among the Jews a king is called
*Christ*.  And the reason of this appellation is this:  Although indeed
He was the Son of God, and the beginning of all things, He became man;
Him first God anointed with oil which was taken from the wood of the
tree of life:  from that anointing therefore He is called *Christ*. 
Thence, moreover, He Himself also, according to the appointment of His
Father, anoints with similar oil every one of the pious when they come
to His kingdom, for their refreshment after their labours, as having got
over the difficulties of the way; so that their light may shine, and
being filled with the Holy Spirit, they may be endowed with
immortality. <span id="fr_577"></span>[578](#fn_577)   But it occurs to
me that I have sufficiently explained to you the whole nature of that
branch from which that ointment is taken.”

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xlv-p3"></span> \[The discourse of chaps. 45–52 is
interesting from its christological consistency.  The doctrine, while
showing Ebionitic origin, is closer to the Catholic view than that of
the *Homilies*.—R.\]

<span id="vi.iii.iii.xlv-p4"></span> \[The references to oil in chaps.
45–48, particularly the connection of anointing with baptism, have been
regarded, since the discovery of the full text of Hippolytus, as showing
traces of relationship to the system of the Elkesaites.  See
Introductory Notice.  In the forms given by Hippolytus (see *Ante-Nicene
Fathers*, v. pp. 132, 133) the oil is represented as one of “seven
witnesses” to be adjured by the subject of baptism.—R.\]
