<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.xxiii-p2"></A>Then Peter, having heard my answer with pleasure, said:&#160; &#8220;I congratulate you because you have answered thus, not because you speak of these things easily, but because you profess that you remember them; for the most sublime truths are best honoured by means of silence.&#160; Yet, for the credit of those things which you remember concerning things not to be spoken,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_544"><FONT SIZE="1">545</FONT></A>
 tell me what you retain of those things which we spoke of in the second place, which can easily be spoken out, that, perceiving your tenacity of memory, I may the more readily point out to you, and freely open, the things of which I wish to speak.&#8221;&#160; Then I, when I perceived that he rejoiced in the good memory of his hearers, said:&#160; &#8220;Not only am I mindful of your definition, but also of that preface which was prefixed to the definition; and of almost all things that you have expounded, I retain the sense complete, though not all the words; because the things that you have spoken have been made, as it were, native to my soul, and inborn.&#160; For you have held out a most sweet cup to me in my excessive thirst.&#160; And that you may not suppose that I am occupying you with words, being unmindful of things, I shall now call to mind the things which were spoken, in which the order of your discussion greatly helps me; for the way in which the things that you said followed by consequence upon one another, and were arranged in a balanced manner, makes them easily recalled to memory by the lines of their order.&#160; For the order of sayings is useful for remembering them:&#160; for when you begin to follow them point by point in succession, when anything is wanting, immediately the sense seeks for it; and when it has found it, retains it, or at all events, if it cannot discover it, there will be no reluctance to ask it of the master.&#160; But not to delay in granting what you demand of me, I shall shortly rehearse what you delivered to me concerning the definition of truth.&#8221;</p>
