<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xi.vi-p2"></A>&#8220;For on this account Jesus is concealed from the Jews, who have taken Moses as their teacher, and Moses is hidden from those who have believed Jesus.&#160; For, there being one teaching by both, God accepts him who has believed either of these.&#160; But believing a teacher is for the sake of doing the things spoken by God.&#160; And that this is so our Lord Himself says, &#145;I thank thee, Father of heaven and earth, because Thou hast concealed these things from the wise and elder, and hast revealed them to sucking babes.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1092"></A><A HREF="#fn_1092"><FONT SIZE="1">1093</FONT></A>
&#160; Thus God Himself has concealed a teacher from some, as foreknowing what they ought to do, and has revealed him to others, who are ignorant what they ought to do.</p>
