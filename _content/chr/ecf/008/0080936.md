<span id="vi.iv.xiv.ii-p2"></span>“Inasmuch as, by long-continued
neglect on your part, to your own injury, your mind has caused to sprout
many hurtful conceptions about religion, and ye have become like land
fallow by the carelessness of the husbandman, you need a long time for
your purification, that your mind, receiving like good seed the true
word that is imparted to you, may not choke it with evil cares, and
render it unfruitful with respect to works that are able to save you. 
Wherefore it behoves those who are careful of their own salvation to
hear more constantly, that their sins which have been long multiplying
may, in the short time that remains, be matched with constant care for
their purification.  Since, therefore, no one knows the time of his end,
hasten to pluck out the many thorns of your hearts; but not by little
and little, for then you cannot be purified, for you have been long
fallow. <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125)
