<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xx.vii-p2"></A>&#8220;Knowing therefore that we knew all that was spoken by Him, and that we could supply the proofs, He sent us to the ignorant Gentiles to baptize them for remission of sins, and commanded us to teach them first.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1328"></A><A HREF="#fn_1328"><FONT SIZE="1">1329</FONT></A>
&#160; Of His commandments this is the first and great one, to fear the Lord God, and to serve Him only.&#160; But He meant us to fear that God whose angels they are who are the angels of the least of the faithful amongst us, and who stand in heaven continually beholding the face of the Father.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1329"></A><A HREF="#fn_1329"><FONT SIZE="1">1330</FONT></A>
&#160; For He has shape, and He has every limb primarily and solely for beauty&#146;s sake, and not for use.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1330"></A><A HREF="#fn_1330"><FONT SIZE="1">1331</FONT></A>
&#160; For He has not eyes that He may see with them; for He sees on every side, since He is incomparably more brilliant in His body than the visual spirit which is in us, and He is more splendid than everything, so that in comparison with Him the light of the sun may be reckoned as darkness.&#160; Nor has He ears that He may hear; for He hears, perceives, moves, energizes, acts on every side.&#160; But He has the most beautiful shape on account <A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A> <a name="vi.iv.xx.vii-Page_320"></A>of man, that the pure in heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1331"></A><A HREF="#fn_1331"><FONT SIZE="1">1332</FONT></A>
 may be able to see Him, that they may rejoice because they suffered.&#160; For He moulded man in His own shape as in the grandest seal, in order that he may be the ruler and lord of all, and that all may be subject to him.&#160; Wherefore, judging that He is the universe, and that man is His image (for He is Himself invisible, but His image man is visible), the man who wishes to worship Him honours His visible image, which is man.&#160; Whatsoever therefore any one does to man, be it good or bad, is regarded as being done to Him.&#160; Wherefore the judgment which proceeds from Him shall go before, giving to every one according to his merits.&#160; For He avenges His own shape.</p>
