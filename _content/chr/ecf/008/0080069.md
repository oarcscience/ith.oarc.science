id="vi.iii.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.—Arrival of Barnabas at
Rome.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.vii-p2"></span>At length meetings began to be held
in various places in the city, and this subject to be discussed in
conversation, and to be a matter of wonder who this might be who had
appeared, and what message He had brought from God to men; until, about
the same year, a certain man, standing in a most crowded place in the
city, made proclamation to the people, saying:  “Hear me, O ye citizens
of Rome.  The Son of God is now in the regions of Judæa, promising
eternal life to every one who will hear Him, but upon condition that he
shall regulate his actions according to the will of Him by whom He hath
been sent, even of God the Father.  Wherefore turn ye from evil things
to good, from things temporal to things eternal.  Acknowledge that there
is one God, ruler of heaven and earth, in whose righteous sight ye
unrighteous inhabit His world.  But if ye be converted, and act
according to His will, then, coming to the world to come, and being made
immortal, ye shall enjoy His unspeakable blessings and rewards.” <span
id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535)   Now, the man who spoke these things
to the people was from the regions of the East, by nation a Hebrew, by
name Barnabas, who said that he himself was one of His disciples, and
that he was sent for this end, that he should declare these things to
those who would hear them. <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536)  
When I heard these things, I began, with the rest of the <span
id="page_79">p. 79</span> <span
id="vi.iii.iii.vii-Page_79"></span>multitude, to follow him, and to hear
what he had to say.  Truly I perceived that there was nothing of
dialectic artifice in the man, but that he expounded with simplicity,
and without any craft of speech, such things as he had heard from the
Son of God, or had seen.  For he did not confirm his assertions by the
force of arguments, but produced, from the people who stood round about
him, many witnesses of the sayings and marvels which he related.
