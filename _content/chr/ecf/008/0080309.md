id="vi.iii.vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII.—The Weakest Christian
More Powerful Than the Strongest Demon.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi.xxxiii-p2"></span>“Is it, then, that we are of
another and a superior nature, and that therefore the demons are afraid
of us?  Nay, we are of one and the same nature with you, but we differ
in religion.  But if you will also be *like us,* we do not grudge it,
but rather we exhort you, and wish you to be assured, that when the same
faith and religion and innocence of life shall be in you that is in us,
you will have equal and the same power and virtue against demons,
through God rewarding your faith.  For as he who has soldiers under him,
although he may be inferior, and they superior to him in strength, yet
‘says to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he
cometh; and to another, Do this, and he doeth it;’ <span
id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742) and this he is able to do, not by his
own power, but by the fear of Cæsar; so every faithful one commands the
demons, although they seem to be much stronger than men, and that not by
means of his own power, but by means of the power of God, who has put
them in subjection.  For even that which we have just spoken of, that
Cæsar is held in awe by all soldiers, and in every camp, and in his
whole kingdom, though he is but one man, and perhaps feeble in respect
of bodily strength, this is not effected but by the power of God, who
inspires all with fear, that they may be subject to one.
