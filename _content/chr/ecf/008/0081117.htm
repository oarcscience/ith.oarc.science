<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.xxii-p2"></A>When Simon said this, and was going to depart, Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Listen to this one other remark, and then go where you like.&#8221;&#160; Whereupon Simon turned back and remained, and Peter said:&#160; &#8220;I know how you were then astonished when you heard me say, &#145;Whosoever says anything whatever against God who created the world, I do not believe him.&#146;&#160; But listen now to something additional, and greater than this.&#160; If God who created the world has in reality such a character as the Scriptures assign Him, and if somehow or other He is incomparably wicked, more wicked&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1399"></A><A HREF="#fn_1399"><FONT SIZE="1">1400</FONT></A>
 than either the Scriptures were able to represent Him, or any other can even conceive Him to be, nevertheless&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1400"></A><A HREF="#fn_1400"><FONT SIZE="1">1401</FONT></A>
 I shall not give up worshipping Him alone, and doing His will.&#160; For I wish you to know and to be convinced, that he who has not affection for his own Creator, can never have it towards another.&#160; And if he has it towards another, he has it contrary to nature, and he is ignorant that he has this passion for the unjust from the evil one.&#160; Nor will he be able to retain even it stedfastly.&#160; And, indeed, if there is another above the Creator (Demiurge), he will welcome me, since he is good, all the more that I love my own Father; and he will not welcome you, as he knows that you have abandoned your own natural Creator:&#160; for I do not call Him Father, influenced by a greater hope, and not caring for what is reasonable.&#160; Thus, even if you find one who is superior to Him, he knows that you will one day abandon him; and the more so that he has not been your father, since you have abandoned Him who was really your Father.</p>
