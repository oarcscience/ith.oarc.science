<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxxiii-p2"></span>Then Peter:  “Do not rashly take
exception, O Simon, against the things which you do not understand.  In
the first place, I shall answer your assertion, that I set forth the
words of my Master, and from them resolve matters about which there is
still doubt.  Our Lord, when He sent us apostles to preach, enjoined us
to teach all nations <span id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627) the things
which were committed to us.  We cannot therefore speak those things as
they were spoken by Himself.  For our commission is not to *speak*, but
to *teach* those things, and from them to show how every one of them
rests upon truth.  Nor, again, are we permitted to speak anything of our
own.  For we are sent; and of necessity he who is sent delivers the
message as he has been ordered, and sets forth the will of the sender. 
For if I should speak anything different from what He who sent me
enjoined me, I should be a false apostle, not saying what I am commanded
to say, but what seems good to myself.  Whoever does this, evidently
wishes to show himself to be better than he is by whom he is sent, and
without doubt is a traitor.  If, on the contrary, he keeps by the things
that he is commanded, and brings forward most clear assertions of them,
it will appear that he is accomplishing the work of an apostle; and it
is by striving to fulfil this that I displease you.  Blame me not,
therefore, because I bring forward the words of Him who sent me.  But if
there is aught in them that is not fairly spoken, you have liberty to
confute me; but this can in no wise be done, for He is a prophet, and
cannot be contrary to Himself.  But if you do not think that He is a
prophet, let this be first inquired into.”
