<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.vii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.—Who are Worshippers of
God?</span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii.xxxiv-p2"></span>“But some one will say, These
passions sometimes befall even those who worship God.  It is not true. 
For we say, that he is a worshipper of God, who does the will of God,
and observes the precepts of His law.  For in God’s estimation he is not
a Jew who is called a Jew among men (nor is he a Gentile that is called
a Gentile), but he who, believing in God, fulfils His law and does His
will, though he be not circumcised. <span
id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770)   He is the true worshipper of God,
who not only is himself free from passions, but also sets others free
from them; though they be so heavy that they are like mountains, he
removes them by means of the faith with which he believes in God.  Yea,
by faith he truly removes mountains with their trees, if it be
necessary. <span id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771)   But he who seems to
worship God, but is neither fortified by a full faith, nor by obedience
to the commandments, but is a sinner, has given a place in himself, by
reason of his sins, to passions, which are appointed of God for the
punishment of those <span id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span
id="vi.iii.vii.xxxiv-Page_152"></span>who sin, that they may exact from
them the deserts of their sins by means of punishments inflicted, and
may bring them purified to the general judgment of all, provided always
that their faith do not fail them in their chastisement.  For the
chastisement of unbelievers in the present life is a judgment, by which
they begin to be separated from future blessings; but the chastisement
of those who worship God, while it is inflicted upon them for sins into
which they have fallen, exacts from them the due of what they have done,
that, preventing the judgment, they may pay the debt of their sin in the
present life, and be freed, at least in half, from the eternal
punishments which are there prepared.
