<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.iii.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXII.—Righteousness; What It
is.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.xxii-p2"></span>“And therefore I advise that His
righteousness be first inquired into, that, pursuing our journey through
it, and placed in the way of truth, we may be able to find the true
Prophet, running not with swiftness of foot, but with goodness of works,
and that, enjoying His guidance, we may be under no danger of mistaking
the way.  For if under His guidance we shall merit to enter that city to
which we desire to come, all things concerning which we now inquire we
shall see with our eyes, being made, as it were, heirs of all things. 
Understand, therefore, that the way is this course of our life; the
travellers are those who do good works; the gate is the true Prophet, of
whom we speak; the city is the kingdom in which dwells the Almighty
Father, whom only those can see who are of pure heart. <span
id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616)   Let us not then think the labour of
this journey hard, because at the end of it there shall be rest.  For
the true Prophet Himself also from the beginning of the world, through
the course of time, hastens to rest.  For He is present with us at all
times; and if at any time it is necessary, He appears and corrects us,
that He may bring to eternal life those who obey Him.  Therefore this is
my judgment, as also it is the pleasure of the true Prophet, that
inquiry should first be made concerning righteousness, by those
especially who profess that they know God.  If therefore any one has
anything to propose which he thinks better, let him speak; and when he
has spoken, let him hear, but with patience and quietness:  for in order
to this at the first, by way of salutation, I prayed for peace to you
all.”
