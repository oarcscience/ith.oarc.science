id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—Peter’s Satisfaction with
Clement.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p2"></span>And, at the same time, he satisfied me
by expounding to me who He is, and how He is found, and holding Him
forth to me as truly to be found, showing that the truth is more
manifest to the ear by the discourse of the prophet than things that are
seen with the eye; so that I was astonished, and wondered that no one
sees those things which are sought after by all, though they lie before
him.  However, having written this discourse concerning the Prophet by
his order, he caused the volume to be despatched to you from Cæsarea
Stratonis, saying that he had a charge from you to send his discourses
and his acts year by year. <span id="fr_914"></span>[915](#fn_914)  
Thus, on the very first day, beginning only concerning the prophet of
the truth, he confirmed me in every respect; and then he spoke thus: 
“Henceforth give heed to the discussions that take place between me and
those on the other side; and even if I come off at a disadvantage, I am
not afraid of your ever doubting of the truth that has been delivered to
you, knowing well that I seem to be beaten, but not the doctrine that
has been delivered to us by the Prophet.  However, I hope not to come
off in our inquiries at a disadvantage with men who have understanding—I
mean lovers of truth, who are able to know what discourses are specious,
artificial, and pleasant, and what are unartificial and simple, trusting
only to the truth *that is conveyed* through them.”

<span id="vi.iv.iv.xx-p3"></span> The text is probably corrupt or
defective.  As it stands, grammatically Peter writes the discourse and
sends it, and yet “by his order” must also apply to Peter.  The
*Recognitions* make Clement write the book and send it.  The passage is
deemed important, and is accordingly discussed in Schliemann, p. 83;
Hilgenfeld, p. 37; and Uhlhorn, p. 101.  \[See *Recognitions*, i. 17. 
Both passages, despite the variation, may be urged in support of the
existence of an earlier document as the common basis of the Clementine
literature.—R.\]
