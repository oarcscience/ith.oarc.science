<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.v.v-p2"></A>Then said Simon:&#160; &#8220;You seem to me to be angry; but if it be so, it is not necessary to enter into the conflict.&#8221;&#160; Then Peter:&#160; &#8220;I see that you perceive that you are to be convicted, and you wish politely to escape from the contest; for what have you seen to have made me angry against you, a man desiring to deceive so great a multitude, and when you have nothing to say, pretending moderation, who also command, forsooth, by your authority that the controversy shall be conducted as you please, and not as order demands?&#8221;&#160; Then Simon:&#160; &#8220;I shall enforce myself to bear patiently your unskilfulness, that I may show that you indeed wish to seduce the people, but that I teach the truth.&#160; But now I refrain from a discussion concerning that boundless light.&#160; Answer me, therefore, what I ask of you.&#160; Since God, as you say, made all things, whence comes evil?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_679"></A><A HREF="#fn_679"><FONT SIZE="1">680</FONT></A>
 &#160;Then said Peter:&#160; &#8220;To put questions in this way is not the part of an opponent, but of a learner.&#160; If therefore you wish to learn, confess it; and I shall first teach you how you ought to learn, and when you have learned to listen, then straightway I shall begin to teach you.&#160; But if you do not wish to learn, as though you knew all things, I shall first set forth the faith which I preach, and do you also set forth what you think to be true; and when the profession of each of us has been disclosed, let our hearers judge whose discourse is supported by truth.&#8221;&#160; To this Simon answered:&#160; &#8220;This is a good joke:&#160; behold a fellow who offers to teach me!&#160; Nevertheless I shall suffer you, and bear with your ignorance and your arrogance.&#160; I confess, then, I do wish to learn; let us see how you can teach me.&#8221;</p>
