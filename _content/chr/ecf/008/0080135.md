Zacchæus.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii.lxxiii-p2"></span>“When I entered the city, our
most beloved brother Zacchæus met me; and embracing me, brought me to
this lodging, in which he himself stayed, inquiring of me concerning
each of the brethren, especially concerning our honourable brother
James.  And when I told him that he was still lame on one foot, on his
immediately asking the cause of this, I related to him all that I have
now detailed to you, how we had been called by the priests and Caiaphas
the high priest to the temple, and how James the archbishop, standing on
the top of the steps, had for seven successive days shown the whole
people from the Scriptures of the Lord that Jesus is the Christ; and
how, when all were acquiescing that they should be baptized by him in
the name of Jesus, an enemy did all those things which I have already
mentioned, and which I need not repeat.”
