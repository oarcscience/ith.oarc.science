<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.vii.xxii-p2"></A>&#8220;But let us pass over this now.&#160; But this we all know, that universally men are beyond measure enraged on account of it, that wars have been waged, that there have been overthrows of houses, and captures of cities, and myriads of other evils.&#160; On this account I betook myself to the holy God and law of the Jews, putting my faith in the well-assured conclusion that the law has been assigned by the righteous judgment of God, and that the soul must at some time receive according to the desert of its deeds.&#8221;</p>
