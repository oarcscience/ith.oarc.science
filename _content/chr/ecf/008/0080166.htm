<p class="c35"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxix-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxix-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXIX.&#8212;Peace and Strife.</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iv.xxix-p2"></A>&#8220;Thus, therefore, our Master, inviting His disciples to patience, impressed upon them that the blessing of peace was also to be preserved with the labour of patience.&#160; But, on the other hand, He mourned over those who lived in riches and luxury, who bestowed nothing upon the poor; proving that they must render an account, because they did not pity their neighbours, even when they were in poverty, whom they ought to love as themselves.&#160; And by such sayings as these He brought some indeed to obey Him, but others He rendered hostile.&#160; The believers therefore, and the obedient, He charges to have peace among themselves. and says to them, &#145;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the very sons of God.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_621"></A><A HREF="#fn_621"><FONT SIZE="1">622</FONT></A>
&#160; But to those who not only did not believe, but set themselves in opposition to His doctrine, He proclaims the war of the word and of confutation, and says that &#145;henceforth ye shall see son separated from father, and husband from wife, and daughter from mother, and brother from brother, and daughter-in-law from mother-in-law, and a man&#146;s foes shall be they of his own house.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_622"></A><A HREF="#fn_622"><FONT SIZE="1">623</FONT></A>
&#160; For in every house, when there begins to be a difference betwixt believer and unbeliever, there is necessarily a contest:&#160; the unbelievers, on the one hand, fighting against the faith; and the believers on the other, confuting the old error and the vices of sins in them.&#8221;</p>
