<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.ix.xxii-p2"></A>Then Peter, holding her hand, led her to the ship.&#160; And when I saw him giving his hand to the woman, I began to laugh; yet, approaching to do him honour, I tried to substitute my hand for his, and to support the woman.&#160; But as soon as I touched her hand, she uttered a loud scream, and rushed into my embrace, and began to devour me with a mother&#146;s kisses.&#160; But I, being ignorant of the whole matter, pushed her off as a mad woman; and at the same time, though with reverence, I was somewhat angry with Peter.</p>
