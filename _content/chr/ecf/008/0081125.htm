<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.vi-p2"></A>And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;When you have discussed all the subjects which I have laid before you, I shall show you the cause of evil.&#160; Then I shall also reply to what you have now said, and prove that that God whom you affirm to be blameless is blameable.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Since I perceive from what you say at the commencement that you are striving after nothing else than to subject God, as being the author of evil, to blame, I have resolved to go along with you all the ways you like, and to prove that God is entirely free from blame.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;You say this as loving God, whom you suppose you know; but you are not right.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;But you, as being wicked, and hating God whom you have not known, utter blasphemous words.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Remember that you have likened me to the author of evil.&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;I confess it, I was wrong in comparing you to the evil one; for I was compelled to do so, because I have not found one who is your equal, or worse than you.&#160; For this reason I likened you to the evil one; for you happen to be much more wicked than the author of evil.&#160; For no one can prove that the evil one spoke against God; but all of us who are present see you speaking daringly against Him.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;He who seeks the truth ought not to gratify any one in any respect contrary to what is really true.&#160; For why does he make the inquiry at all?&#160; Why, I ask? for I am not also able, laying aside the accurate investigation of things, to spend all my time in the praise of that God whom I do not know.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1419"></A><A HREF="#fn_1419"><FONT SIZE="1">1420</FONT></A>
