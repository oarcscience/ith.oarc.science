<p class="c35"><a name="vii.xvi.v-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="vii.xvi.v-p1.1"></A>Chapter 5 (21).</span></p> 
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvi.v-p2"></A>And as Prince Satan and Hades were thus speaking to each other in turn, suddenly there was a voice as of thunders, and a shouting of spirits:&#160; Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates; and the King of glory shall come in.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1977"></A><A HREF="#fn_1977"><FONT SIZE="1">1978</FONT></A>
&#160; Hades hearing this, said to Prince Satan:&#160; Retire from me, and go outside of my realms:&#160; if thou art a powerful warrior, fight against the King of glory.&#160; But what hast thou to do with Him?&#160; And Hades thrust Satan outside of his realms.&#160; And Hades said to his impious officers:&#160; Shut the cruel gates of brass, and put up the bars of iron, and resist bravely, that we, holding captivity, may not take <i>Him</i> captive.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1978"></A><A HREF="#fn_1978"><FONT SIZE="1">1979</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvi.v-p5"></A>And all the multitude of the saints, hearing this, said to Hades, with the voice of reproach:&#160; Open thy gates, that the King of glory may come in.&#160; And David cried out, saying:&#160; Did I not, when I was alive upon earth, prophesy to you:&#160; Let them confess to the Lord His tender mercies and His wonderful works to the children of men:&#160; for He has shattered the brazen gates, and burst the iron bars; He has taken them up out of the way of their iniquity?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1979"></A><A HREF="#fn_1979"><FONT SIZE="1">1980</FONT></A>
&#160; And after this, in like manner, Esaias said:&#160; Did not I, when I was alive upon earth, prophesy to you:&#160; The dead shall rise up, and those who are in their tombs shall rise again, and those who are upon earth shall exult; because the dew, which is from the Lord, is their health?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1980"></A><A HREF="#fn_1980"><FONT SIZE="1">1981</FONT></A>
&#160; And again I said, Where, O Death, is thy sting? where, O Hades, is thy victory?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1981"></A><A HREF="#fn_1981"><FONT SIZE="1">1982</FONT></A>
</p> 
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.xvi.v-p9"></A>And when all the saints heard this from Esaias, they said to Hades:&#160; Open thy gates.&#160; Since thou art now conquered, thou wilt be weak and powerless.&#160; And there was a great voice, as of thunders, saying:&#160; Lift up your gates, ye princes; and be ye lifted up, ye infernal gates; and the King of glory shall come in.&#160; Hades, seeing that they had twice shouted out this, says, as if not knowing:&#160; Who is the king of glory?&#160; David says, in answer to Hades:&#160; I recognise those words of the shout, since I prophesied the same by His Spirit.&#160; And now, what I have said above I say to thee, The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle; He is the King of glory.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1982"></A><A HREF="#fn_1982"><FONT SIZE="1">1983</FONT></A>
&#160; And the Lord Himself hath looked down from heaven upon earth, to hear the groans of the prisoners, and to release the sons of the slain.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1983"></A><A HREF="#fn_1983"><FONT SIZE="1">1984</FONT></A>
&#160; And now, most filthy and most foul Hades, open thy gates, that the King of glory may come in.&#160; While David was thus speaking, there came to Hades, in the form of a man, the Lord of majesty, and lighted up the eternal darkness, and burst asunder the indissoluble chains; and the aid of unconquered power visited us, sitting in the profound darkness of transgressions, and in the shadow of death of sins.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1984"></A><A HREF="#fn_1984"><FONT SIZE="1">1985</FONT></A>
