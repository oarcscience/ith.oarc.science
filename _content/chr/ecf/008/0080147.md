Deception.</span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv.x-p2"></span>“But when he spoke thus of the
production of sprouts and the perforation of the mountain, I was
confounded on this account, because he wished to deceive even us, in
whom he seemed to place confidence; for we knew that those things had
been from the days of our fathers, which he represented as having been
done by himself lately.  We then, although we heard these atrocities
from him, and worse than these, yet we followed up his crimes, and
suffered others to be deceived by him, telling also many lies on his
behalf; and this before he did any of the things which he had promised,
so that while as yet he had done nothing, he was by some thought to be
God.”
