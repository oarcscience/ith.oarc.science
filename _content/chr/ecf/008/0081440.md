id="viii.ix.i-Page_640"></span><span class="c19"><span
id="viii.ix.i-p1.1"></span>Decrees of Fabian.</span>

<span id="viii.ix.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="viii.ix.i-p3"></span><span class="c6"><span
id="viii.ix.i-p3.1"></span>Taken from the Decretal of Gratian.</span>

<span id="viii.ix.i-p4"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.ix.i-p4.1"></span>I.</span>

<span id="viii.ix.i-p5"></span>*That the man who refuses to be
reconciled to his brother should be reduced by the severest
fastings.* <span id="fr_2875"></span>[2876](#fn_2875)

<span id="viii.ix.i-p7"></span><span class="c9"><span
id="viii.ix.i-p7.1"></span>If</span> any injured person refuses to be
reconciled to his brother, when he who has injured him offers
satisfaction, he should be reduced by the severest fastings, even until
he accepts the satisfaction offered him with thankful mind.

<span id="viii.ix.i-p8"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.ix.i-p8.1"></span>II.</span>

<span id="viii.ix.i-p9"></span>*The man is rendered infamous who
knowingly presumes to forswear himself.* <span
id="fr_2876"></span>[2877](#fn_2876)

<span id="viii.ix.i-p11"></span>Whosoever has knowingly forsworn
himself, should be put for forty days on bread and water, and do penance
also for the seven following years; and he should never be without
penance; and he should never be admitted to bear witness.  After this,
however, he may enjoy communion.

<span id="viii.ix.i-p12"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.ix.i-p12.1"></span>III.</span>

<span id="viii.ix.i-p13"></span>*A man and a woman subject to madness
cannot enter into marriage.* <span id="fr_2877"></span>[2878](#fn_2877)

<span id="viii.ix.i-p15"></span>Neither can a mad man nor a mad woman
enter into the marriage relation.  But if it has been entered, then they
shall not be separated.

<span id="viii.ix.i-p16"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.ix.i-p16.1"></span>IV.</span>

<span id="viii.ix.i-p17"></span>*Marriage relations in the fifth
generation may unite with each other; and in the fourth generation, if
they are found, they should not be separated.* <span
id="fr_2878"></span>[2879](#fn_2878)

<span id="viii.ix.i-p19"></span>Concerning relations who enter affinity
by the connection of husband and wife, these, on the decease of wife or
husband, may form a union in the fifth generation; and in the fourth, if
they are found, they should not be separated.  In the third degree of
relationship, however, it is not lawful for one to take the wife of
another on his death.  In an equable manner, a man may be united in
marriage after his wife’s death with those who are his own kinswomen,
and with the kinswomen of his wife.

<span id="viii.ix.i-p20"></span>*To the immediately preceding
notice.* <span id="fr_2879"></span>[2880](#fn_2879)

<span id="viii.ix.i-p22"></span>Those who marry a wife allied by blood,
and are separated, shall not be at liberty, as long as both parties are
alive, to unite other wives with them in marriage, unless they can plead
the excuse of ignorance.

<span id="viii.ix.i-p23"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.ix.i-p23.1"></span>V.</span>

<span id="viii.ix.i-p24"></span>*Blood connections alone, or, if
offspring entirely fails, the old and trustworthy, should reckon the
matter of propinquity in the synod.* <span
id="fr_2880"></span>[2881](#fn_2880)

<span id="viii.ix.i-p26"></span>No alien should accuse blood
connections, or reckon the matter of consanguinity in the synod, but
relations to whose knowledge it pertains,—that is, father and mother,
sister and brother, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, paternal aunt,
maternal aunt, and their children.  If, however, offspring entirely
fails, the bishop shall make inquiry canonically of the older and more
trustworthy persons to whom the same relationship may be known; and if
such relationship is found, the parties should be separated.

<span id="viii.ix.i-p27"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.ix.i-p27.1"></span>VI.</span>

<span id="viii.ix.i-p28"></span>*Every one of the faithful should
communicate three times a year.* <span
id="fr_2881"></span>[2882](#fn_2881)

<span id="viii.ix.i-p30"></span>Although they may not do it more
frequently, yet at least three times in the year should the laity
communicate, unless one happen to be hindered by any more serious
offences,—to wit, at Easter, and Pentecost, and the Lord’s Nativity.

<span id="viii.ix.i-p31"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="viii.ix.i-p31.1"></span>VII.</span>

<span id="viii.ix.i-p32"></span>*A presbyter should not be ordained
younger than thirty years of age.* <span
id="fr_2882"></span>[2883](#fn_2882)

<span id="viii.ix.i-p34"></span>If one has not completed thirty years of
age, he should in no way be ordained as presbyter, even although he may
be extremely worthy; for even the Lord Himself was baptized only when He
was thirty years of age, and at that period He began to teach.  It is
not right, therefore, that one who is to be ordained should be
consecrated until he has reached this legitimate age.
