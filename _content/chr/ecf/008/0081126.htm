<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxii.vii-p2"></A>And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;You are not so blessed as to praise Him, nor indeed can you do such a good deed as this; for then you would be full of Him.&#160; For thus said our Teacher, who always spoke the truth:&#160; &#145;Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1420"></A><A HREF="#fn_1420"><FONT SIZE="1">1421</FONT></A>
&#160; Whence you, abounding in evil purposes, through ignorance speak against the only good God.&#160; And not yet suffering what you deserve to suffer for the words which you have dared to utter,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1421"></A><A HREF="#fn_1421"><FONT SIZE="1">1422</FONT></A>
 you either imagine that there will be no judgment, or perchance you think that there is not even a God.&#160; Whence, not comprehending such long-suffering as His, you are moving on to still greater madness.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Do not imagine that you will frighten me into not investigating the truth of your examples.&#160; For I am so eager for the truth, that for its sake I will not shrink from undergoing danger.&#160; If, then, you have anything to say in regard to the propositions made by me at the commencement, say it now.&#8221;</p>
