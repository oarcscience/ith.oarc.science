<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.x.lxi-p2"></A>&#8220;For let us consider carefully the work of divine providence.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_831"></A><A HREF="#fn_831"><FONT SIZE="1">832</FONT></A>
&#160; For whereas the philosophers have introduced certain subtile and difficult words, so that not even the terms that they use in their discourses can be known and understood by all, God has shown that those who thought themselves word-framers are altogether unskilful as respects the knowledge of the truth.&#160; For the knowledge of things which is imparted by the true Prophet is simple, and plain, and brief; which those men walking through devious places, and through the stony difficulties of words, are wholly ignorant of.&#160; Therefore, to modest and simple minds, when they see things come to pass which have been foretold, it is enough, and more than enough, that they may receive most certain knowledge from most certain prescience; and for the rest may be at peace, having received evident knowledge of the truth.&#160; For all other things are treated by opinion, in which there can be nothing firm.&#160; For what speech is there which may not be contradicted?&#160; And what argument is there that may not be overthrown by another argument?&#160; And hence it is, that by disputation of this sort men can never come to any end of knowledge and learning, but find the end of their life sooner than the end of their questions.</p>
