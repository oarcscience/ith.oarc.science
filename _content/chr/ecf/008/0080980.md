<span id="vi.iv.xv.ix-p2"></span>“Therefore my father, being fond of his
children, supplying them suitably for the journey with male and female
servants, put them on board ship, and sent them to Athens with her to be
educated, and kept me alone of his sons with him for his comfort; and
for this I am very thankful, that the vision had not ordered me also to
depart with my mother from the city of Rome.  Then, after the lapse of a
year, my father sent money to them to Athens, and at the same time to
learn how they did.  But those who went on this errand did not return. 
And in the third year, my father being distressed, sent others in like
manner with supplies, and they returned in the fourth year with the
tidings that they had seen neither my mother nor my brothers, nor had
they ever arrived at Athens, nor had they found any trace of any one of
those who set out with them.
