<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xix.xxi-p2"></A>When Peter said this, Simon answered:&#160; &#8220;Since I see you skilfully hinting that what is written in the books&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1309"></A><A HREF="#fn_1309"><FONT SIZE="1">1310</FONT></A>
 against the framer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1310"></A><A HREF="#fn_1310"><FONT SIZE="1">1311</FONT></A>
 <i>of the world</i> does not happen to be true, to-morrow I shall show, from the discourses of your teacher, that he asserted that the framer <i>of the world</i> was not the highest God.&#8221;&#160; And when Simon said this, he went out.&#160; But Peter said to the assembled multitudes:&#160; &#8220;If Simon can do no other injury to us in regard to God, he at least prevents you from listening to the words that can purify the soul.&#8221;&#160; On Peter saying this, much whispering arose amongst the crowds, saying, &#8220;What necessity is there for permitting him to come in here, and utter his blasphemies against God?&#8221;&#160; And Peter heard, and said, &#8220;Would that the doctrines against God which are intended to try men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1311"></A><A HREF="#fn_1311"><FONT SIZE="1">1312</FONT></A>
 went no further than Simon!&#160; For there will be, as the Lord said, false apostles, false prophets,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1312"></A><A HREF="#fn_1312"><FONT SIZE="1">1313</FONT></A>
 heresies, desires for supremacy, who, as I conjecture, finding their beginning in Simon, who blasphemes God, will work together in the assertion of the same opinions against God as those of Simon.&#8221;&#160; And saying this with tears, he summoned the multitudes to him by his hand; and when they came, he laid his hands upon them and prayed, and then dismissed them, telling them to come at an earlier hour next day.&#160; Saying this, and groaning, he entered and went to sleep, without taking food.</p>
