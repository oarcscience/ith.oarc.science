<p class="c21"><a name="vi.iv.xxi.xii-p2"></A>&#8220;We, Simon, do not assert that from the great power, which is also called the dominant&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1381"></A><A HREF="#fn_1381"><FONT SIZE="1">1382</FONT></A>
 power, two angels were sent forth, the one to create the world, the other to give the law; nor that each one when he came proclaimed himself, on account of what he had done, as the sole creator; nor that there is one who stands, will stand, and is opposed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1382"></A><A HREF="#fn_1382"><FONT SIZE="1">1383</FONT></A>
&#160; Learn how you disbelieve even in respect to this subject.&#160; If you say that there is an unrevealed power, that power is full of ignorance.&#160; For it did not foreknow the ingratitude of the angels who were sent by it.&#8221;&#160; And Simon became exceedingly angry with Peter for saying this, and interrupted his discourse, saying:&#160; &#8220;What nonsense is this you speak, you daring and most impudent of men, revealing plainly before the multitudes the secret doctrines, so that they can be easily learned?&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;Why do you grudge that the present audience should receive benefit?&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;Do you then allow that such knowledge is a benefit?&#8221;&#160; And Peter said:&#160; &#8220;I allow it:&#160; for the knowledge of a false doctrine is beneficial, inasmuch as you do not fall into it because of ignorance.&#8221;&#160; And Simon said:&#160; &#8220;You are evidently not able to reply to the propositions I laid before you.&#160; I maintain that even your teacher affirms that there is some Father unrevealed.&#8221;</p>
