id="iii.xi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.—</span>*Origen’s Zeal and
his Elevation to the Presbyterate.*

<span id="iii.xi.xxiii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xxiii-p2.1"></span>At</span> that time Origen began his
commentaries on the Divine Scriptures, being urged thereto by
Ambrose, <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955) who employed
innumerable incentives, not only exhorting him by word, but also
furnishing abundant means.

<span id="iii.xi.xxiii-p4"></span>2. For he dictated to more than seven
amanuenses, who relieved each other at appointed times. And he employed
no fewer copyists, besides girls who were skilled in elegant writing.
For all these Ambrose furnished the necessary expense in abundance,
manifesting himself an inexpressible earnestness in diligence and zeal
for the divine oracles, by which he especially pressed him on to the
preparation of his commentaries.

<span id="iii.xi.xxiii-p5"></span>3. While these things were in
progress, Urbanus, <span id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956) who had
been for eight years bishop of the Roman church, was succeeded by
Pontianus, <span id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957) and Zebinus <span
id="fr_1958"></span>[1959](#fn_1958) succeeded Philetus <span
id="fr_1959"></span>[1960](#fn_1959) in Antioch.

<span id="iii.xi.xxiii-p10"></span>4. At this time Origen was sent to
Greece on account of a pressing necessity in connection with
ecclesiastical affairs, <span id="fr_1960"></span>[1961](#fn_1960) and
went through Palestine, and was ordained as presbyter in Cæsarea by the
bishops of that country. The matters that were agitated concerning him
on this account, and the decisions on these matters by those who
presided over the churches, besides the other works concerning the
divine word which he published while in his prime, demand a separate
treatise. We have written of them to some extent in the second book of
the Defense which we have composed in his behalf. <span

id="iii.xi.xxiii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxiii-p7"></span> For the dates of the first group of
Roman bishops, from Peter to Urbanus, the best source we have is
Eusebius’*Church History;* but for the second group, from Pontianus to
Liberius, the notices of the *History* are very unreliable, while the
Liberian catalogue rests upon very trustworthy data (see Lipsius,
*Chron. d. röm. Bischöfe,* p. 39 and p. 142 sq.). We must therefore turn
to the latter for the most accurate information in regard to the
remaining Roman bishops mentioned by Eusebius, although an occasional
mistake in the catalogue must be corrected by our other sources, as
Lipsius points out. The notice of Eusebius at this point would throw the
accession of Pontianus into the year 231, but this is a year too late,
as seen in chap. 21, note 4. According to chap. 29, he was bishop six
years, and was succeeded by Anteros at about the same time that Gordian
became emperor; that is, in 238. But this is wide of the truth. The
Liberian catalogue, which is supported by the best of the other sources,
gives a little over five years for his episcopate, and puts his
banishment to Sardinia, with which his episcopate ended, on the 28th of
September, 235. According to the Felician catalogue, which may be
trusted at this point, he was brought to Rome and buried there during
the episcopate of Fabian, which began in 236 (see also the preceding
chapter, note 1). We know nothing about the life and character of
Pontianus.

<span id="fn_1958"></span>[271:1959](2010193.htm#fr_1958) <span
id="iii.xi.xxiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxiii-p8"></span> The notices of the *Chronicle* in
connection with Zebinus are especially unreliable. The *Armen.* puts his
accession into the sixth (227), Jerome into the seventh year of
Alexander (228). Jerome makes no attempt to fix the date of his death,
while the *Armen.* puts it in the first year of Gallus (251–252).
Syncellus assigns him but six years. In the midst of such confusion we
are obliged to rely solely upon the *History.* The only reliable data we
have are Origen’s ordination to the priesthood, which took place in 231
(see below, p. 392) and apparently, according to this chapter, while
Zebinus was bishop of Antioch. If Eusebius is correct in this
synchronization, Zebinus became bishop before 231, and therefore the
statements of the *Chron.* as to his accession may be approximately
correct. As to the time of his death, we know that his successor,
Babylas, died in the Decian persecution (see chap. 39), and hence
Zebinus must have died some years before that. In chap. 29, Eusebius
puts his death in the reign of Gordian (238–244), and this may be
accepted as at least approximately correct, for we have reason to think
that Babylas was already bishop in the time of Philip (see chap. 29,
note 8). This proves the utter incorrectness of the notice of the
*Armen.* We know nothing about the person and life of Zebinus. Harnack
concludes from his name that he was a Syrian by birth. Most of the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xi.xxiii-p8.1"></span>mss.</span> of Eusebius
give his name as <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxiii-p8.2"></span>Ζεβῖνος</span>; one <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xi.xxiii-p8.3"></span>ms.</span> and
Nicephorus, as <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxiii-p8.4"></span>Ζέβενος</span>; Syncellus as <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xxiii-p8.5"></span>Ζέβεννος</span>;
Rufinus, Jerome, and the *Armen.* as Zebennus.

<span id="iii.xi.xxiii-p12"></span> Eusebius refers here to the Defense
of Origen, composed by himself and Pamphilus, which is unfortunately now
lost (see above, chap. 2, note 1, and the Prolegomena, p. 36 sq.).
