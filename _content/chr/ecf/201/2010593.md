<span id="iv.vi.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Ambassadors from
Different Barbarous Nations receive Presents from the Emperor.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.vii-p2.1"></span>Indeed</span>, ambassadors were
continually arriving from all nations, bringing for his acceptance their
most precious gifts. So that I myself have sometimes stood near the
entrance of the imperial palace, and observed a noticeable array of
barbarians in attendance, differing from each other in costume and
decorations, and equally unlike in the fashion of their hair and beard.
Their aspect truculent and terrible, their bodily stature prodigious:
some of a red complexion, others white as snow, others again of an
intermediate color. For in the number of those I have referred to might
be seen specimens of the Blemmyan tribes, of the Indians, and the
Ethiopians, <span id="fr_3312"></span>[3313](#fn_3312) “that
widely-divided race, remotest of mankind.” All these in due succession,
like some painted pageant, presented to the emperor those gifts which
their own nation held in most esteem; some offering crowns of gold,
others diadems set with precious stones; some bringing fair-haired boys,
others barbaric vestments embroidered with gold and flowers: some
appeared with horses, others with shields and long spears, with arrows
and bows, thereby offering their services and alliance for the emperor’s
acceptance. These presents he separately received and carefully laid
aside, acknowledging them in so munificent a manner as at once to enrich
those who bore them. He also honored the noblest among them with Roman
offices of dignity; so that many of them thenceforward preferred to
continue their residence among us, and felt no desire to revisit their
native land.
