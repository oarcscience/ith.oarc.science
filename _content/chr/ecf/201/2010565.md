<span id="iv.vi.iii.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVI</span>.—*How she made her
Will, and died at the Age of Eighty Years.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xlvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xlvi-p2.1"></span>And</span> when at length at the close
of a long life, she was called to inherit a happier lot, having arrived
at the eightieth year of her age, and being very near the time of her
departure, she prepared and executed her last will in favor of her only
son, the emperor and sole monarch of the world, and her grandchildren,
the Cæsars his sons, to whom severally she bequeathed whatever property
she possessed in any part of the world. Having thus made her will, this
thrice blessed woman died in the presence of her illustrious son, who
was in attendance at her side, caring for her and held her hands: so
that, to those who rightly discerned the truth, the thrice blessed one
seemed not to die, but to experience a real change and transition from
an earthly to a heavenly existence, since her soul, remoulded as it were
into an incorruptible and angelic essence, <span
id="fr_3278"></span>[3279](#fn_3278) was received up into her Saviour’s
presence. <span id="fr_3279"></span>[3280](#fn_3279)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xlvi-p3"></span> \[These words seem to savor of
Origen’s doctrine, to which Eusebius was much addicted. Origen believed
that, in the resurrection, bodies would be changed into souls, and souls
into angels, according to the testimony of Jerome. See Valesius *in
loc.*—*Bag.*\]

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xlvi-p4"></span> The date of Helena’s death is
usually placed in 327 or 328. Compare Wordsworth, l.c. Since she was
eighty years old at the time of her death she must have been about
twenty-five when Constantine was born.
