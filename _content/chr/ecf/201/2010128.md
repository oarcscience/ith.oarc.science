<span id="iii.ix.xix-p4"></span> As was remarked in chap. 11, note 18,
Anicetus held office until 165 or 167, i.e. possibly until the seventh
year of Marcus Aurelius. The date therefore given here for the accession
of Soter is at least a year out of the way. The Armenian *Chron.* puts
his accession in the 236th Olympiad, i.e. the fourth to the seventh year
of this reign, while the version of Jerome puts it in the ninth year.
From Bk. V. chap. 1 we learn that he held office eight years, and this
is the figure given by both versions of the *Chron.* In chap. 23
Eusebius quotes from a letter of Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, addressed
to Soter, in which he remarks that the Corinthian church have been
reading on the Lord’s day an epistle written to them by Soter. It was
during his episcopate that Montanus labored in Asia Minor, and the
anonymous author of the work called *Prædestinatus* (written in the
middle of the fifth century) states that Soter wrote a treatise against
him which was answered by Tertullian, but there seems to be no
foundation for the tradition. Two spurious epistles and several
decretals have been falsely ascribed to him.

<span id="iii.ix.xix-p7"></span> Of Agrippinus we know only what
Eusebius tells us here and in Bk. V. chap. 9, where he says that he held
office twelve years. Jerome’s version of the *Chron.* agrees as to the
duration of his episcopate, but puts his accession in the sixth year of
Marcus Aurelius. In the Armenian version a curious mistake occurs in
connection with his name. Under the ninth year of Marcus Aurelius are
found the words, *Romanorum ecclesiæ XII. episcopus constitutus est
Agrippinus annis IX.,* and then Eleutherus (under the thirteenth year of
the same ruler) is made the thirteenth bishop, while Victor, his
successor, is not numbered, and Zephyrinus the successor of the latter,
is made number fourteen. It is of course plain enough that the
transcriber by an oversight read *Romanorum ecclesiæ* instead of
*Alexandrinæ ecclesiæ,* and then having given Soter just above as the
eleventh bishop, he felt compelled to make Agrippinus the twelfth, and
hence reversed the two numbers, nine and twelve, given in connection
with Agrippinus and made him the twelfth bishop, ruling nine years,
instead of the ninth bishop, ruling twelve years. He then found himself
obliged to make Eleutherus the thirteenth, but brought the list back
into proper shape again by omitting to number Victor as the fourteenth.
It is hard to understand how a copyist could commit such a flagrant
error and not discover it when he found himself subsequently led into
difficulty by it. It simply shows with what carelessness the work of
translation or of transcription was done. As a result of the mistake no
ninth bishop of Alexandria is mentioned, though the proper interval of
twelve years remains between the death of Celadion and the accession of
Julian.
