<p class="c33"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p1"></A>  &sect;2. <i>Sources.</i></p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p2"></A>Remembering the class of students for which the series is chiefly intended, effort has been made to refer to translations of sources where they are at hand, and to refer to the best accessible English authorities on them. But the plan has been to refer to the source itself in the edition actually used, and for literature on them to choose the best for ready reference. Both editions and authorities on sources are therefore selections, usually from many, of such as seem most directly useful. The intention has been to guide to all frequently mentioned sources, whether they were of great value or not, since a useless one costs often quite as much trouble to hunt up and find useless, as a good one to use. It is hardly to be hoped that all the sources often referred to have been gathered, but the following list represents pretty much all that are worth mentioning, and some which are not.</p>  
<p class="c33"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p3"></A>1. <i>Inscriptions, coins, medals, &amp;c.</i></p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p4"></A>In some sense these are the most reliable of sources, in spite of counterfeits. A large number will be found collected in Clinton. For farther critical study, compare the collections, great and small; for which, with the matter of inscriptions in general, see Hicks, E. L., and H&uuml;bner, E., in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, 13 (1881) 121&#8211;133; and Babington, in Smith and Cheetham, 1 (1880) 841&#8211;862. Monographs on those relating to Constantine will be found under the names, Cavedoni, Cigola, Eltz, Freherus, Garucci, Harduin, Penon, Revellot, Valois, Westphalen, Werveke, in the <i>Literature</i> of this volume.</p>  
<p class="c33"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p5"></A>2. <i>Laws</i>.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p6"></A>These, with their dates, their official nature, their fullness and variety, are primary, and are the only sources recognized by some. They are embodied in the Theodosian and Justinian Codes, and collected from these are edited in Migne, <i>Patrol</i>. <i>Latina</i>, Vol. 8. See under <i>Writings</i> of Constantine, above.</p>  
<p class="c33"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p7"></A>3. <i>Other Writings by Constantine</i>.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p8"></A>See under <i>Writings</i>, above, p. 436. With this might perhaps be included also writings <i>to</i> Constantine, like that of Anulinus in Augustinus, <i>Ep</i>. 88.</p>  
<p class="c33"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p9"></A>4. <i>General Literary Sources</i>.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p10"></A>Taking in general chronological order, without attempting the impossibility of fixing the exact chronological place, the first group of contemporary sources is that of the Panegyrists (for collected editions, see Engelmann). <A NAME="page_446"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 446</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.v.ii-Page_446"></A>It was a serious mistake, now recognized, to pass them by as worthless. Like all authentic documents, they have a minimum residuum of undoubted material, which is larger or smaller according to the critical acumen of the investigator. In the case of these, however inflated or eulogistic they may be, the circumstances under which they were spoken give a considerable value.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p11"></A>(1) <i>Incerti auctoris Panegyricus Maximiano et Constantino dictus</i> (<i>Paneg</i>. 307). In Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat</i>. 8 (1844), 609&#8211;620. Pronounced at celebration of marriage of Constantine and Fausta, <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p11.1"></A>a.d.</span> 307. Besides having the great value of being contemporary evidence, the author shows a certain ingenuity in enlarging on the virtues of the young Constantine, who had few deeds to show, and on the deeds of Maximian, who had few virtues, and has therefore a certain discernible modicum of truth.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p12"></A>Compare the <i>Monitum</i> in Migne, Ramsay&#146;s article on <i>Drepanius</i>, in Smith, Dict. 1073&#8211;4, and references under Eumenius.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p13"></A>(2) <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p13.1"></A>Eumenius</span> (310&#8211;311). <i>(a) Panegyric (Panegyricus Constantino Augusto</i>). In Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat</i>. 8 (1884), 619&#8211;640. (<i>b</i>) <i>Thanksgiving Oration (Gratiarum Actio Constantino Augusto</i>). In Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat</i>. 8 (1844), 641&#8211;654. Eumenius flourished during the reigns of Constantius, with whom he was in high favor, and Constantine. He was head of the school at Autun. The <i>Panegyric</i> was delivered at Treves, in 310. The authorship of Eumenius has been unwarrantably questioned, on the ground that the flattery and exaggeration of the work are not consistent with his taste and sense; but it would seem that both his exaggeration and his taste have been themselves exaggerated. His praise is hardly more &#8220;outrageous&#8221; than panegyrics were wont to be,&#8212;or are, for that matter; and so far from being &#8220;worthless,&#8221; there is a peculiar deal of interesting, unquestionable, and primary historical evidence. Still, his taste and veracity are not much above that of modern eulogists of living or dead emperors and politicians. The <i>Gratiarum Actio</i> is the official oration of thanks to Constantine in behalf of the citizens of Autun, on account of favors shown them. It was pronounced at Treves in 311.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p14"></A>Compare Ramsay, in Smith, <i>Dict</i>. 2 (1859), 92; the Pro&#339;mium, in ed. Migne, 619&#8211;622; also for editions, Ramsay, article <i>Drepanius</i>, in Smith, <i>Dict</i>. 1. 1073&#8211;4; and for literature, Chevalier. For general account of the Panegyrists, see this article on Drepanius.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p15"></A>(3) <i>Incerti Panegyricus Constantino Augusto</i> (Paneg. 313). In Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat</i>. 8 (1844), 653&#8211; . This is usually ascribed to Nazarius, on the ground of style. It was spoken at Treves in 313, and relates mainly to the war with Maxentius. Various details relating to this are of such nature and form as to suggest again that the author is the same as that of the 321 Paneg.,&#8212;Nazarius.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p16"></A>Compare Ramsay, in Smith, <i>Dict</i>. 2 (1859), 1145; the Pro&#339;mium in ed. Migne, &amp;c., and literature as under <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p16.1"></A>Eumenius</span>, above.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p17"></A>(4) <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p17.1"></A>Nazarius</span>. (321) <i>Panegyric</i> (<i>Panegyricus Constantino Augusto dictus</i>). In ed. Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat</i>. 8 (1844), 581&#8211;608. Nazarius is mentioned by Jerome as a distinguished rhetorician. This oration was delivered at Rome in 321. Constantine was not present. It is superlatively eulogistic, but like the related panegyrics contains many historical facts of greatest value.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p18"></A>Compare Ramsay, in Smith, <i>Dict</i>. 2 (1859), 1145, the <i>Monitum</i>, in Migne, and references under <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p18.1"></A>Eumenius</span>.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p19"></A>In the midst of the period which these cover comes one of the two great Christian sources, and he is followed by a considerable row of great and small Christians during the century.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p20"></A>(5) <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p20.1"></A>Lactantius</span> (ab. 313&#8211;314). <i>On the Deaths of the Persecutors (De M. P.</i>). Ed. Fritsche (Lips. 1842), 248&#8211;286; ed. Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat</i>. 7 (Par. 1844), 157&#8211;276; tr. in <i>T. &amp; T. Clark Library</i>, 22 (Edinb. 1871), 164&#8211;211, and in Ante-Nicene Fathers (Buffalo and N.Y.), 300&#8211;326 [Lord Hailes&#146; translation]. There are many editions in collected works, and about a dozen separate, and many translations,&#8212;in all a hundred or more editions and translations. There has been much controversy regarding the author of this work, but there is little doubt that it was Lactantius. Ebert (<i>Gesch. chr. Lat. Lit</i>. 1. 83) claims to have demonstrated the fact, and most of the later writers agree. The work was composed after the edict of Constantine and Licinius, and before the break between the two, i.e. 313&#8211;314. It was written thus in the midst of things, and has the peculiar historical value of a contemporary document, unprejudiced by later events. It is a sort of psalm of triumph, colored by the passionate rejoicing of one persecuted over the Divine vengeance which has come upon the persecutors. &#8220;In the use of the work the historian must employ great critical discernment&#8221; (Ebert, in Herzog, 8 [1881], 365). But granted all his prejudice, the facts he witnesses are of first value.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p21"></A>Compare Ffoulkes, in Smith and Wace, 3 (1882), 613&#8211;617; Teuffel, <i>Hist. Rom. Lit</i>. 2 (1873), 334; Ebert, in Herzog, <i>Encyk</i>. 8 (1881), 364&#8211;366, and <i>Gesch. chr. Lat. Lit</i>. 1 (1874), 83; and for farther literature, <i>Bibliog, Synops</i>. in<i>Ante-Nicene Fathers Suppl</i>. (1887), 77&#8211;81.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p22"></A>(6) <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p22.1"></A>Eusebius</span> (ab. 260&#8211;340). I. <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>. 2. <i>Constantine</i>. 3. <i>Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p24"></A>(7) <span class="c13"><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p24.1"></A>Optatian</span> (fl. ab. 326). <i>Panegyric</i>, in Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat</i>. 19 (1846), 395&#8211;432; Letter to Constantine, do. 391&#8211;392. Optatian, Porfirius, or Porphyrius, as he is variously called, is dubiously Christian, composed this <A NAME="page_447"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 447</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.v.ii-Page_447"></A>poem, or series of poems, while in exile, on the occasion of the Vicennalia of Constantine. It dates, therefore, from 325 or 326. It is a most extraordinary aggregation of acrostics, pattern poems, and every possible device of useless, mechanical variety of form, of little value, excepting as a sort of dime-museum exhibition of patience and ingenuity. It consists mainly in calling Constantine flattering names, but contains here and there an historical suggestion. It was accompanied by a letter to Constantine, and drew one from him, and a pardon as well (Hieronymus, <i>Chron.</i>).</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p25"></A>Compare Wilson, article <i>Porfirius,</i> in Smith &amp; W. 4 (1887), 440; article <i>Porphyrius,</i> in Smith, <i>Dict.</i> 3 (1859), 502; and for editions and literature, Engelmann.</p>

Gr.</i> 25&#8211;28 (1857), 4 v.; translated in part in Newman, <i>Library of the Fathers,</i> and in Schaff-Wace, <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</i> (announced). The works of Athanasius contain various letters of Constantine (see under <i>Works</i>) and much of primary historical value for the latter part of Constantine&#146;s reign. So far as it goes, the matter is almost equal to official documents as source.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p27"></A>Compare Bright, in Smith &amp; W. 1 (1877), 179&#8211;203; Schaff, <i>Hist. of Church,</i> 23 (1884), 884&#8211;893; and for extensive literature and editions, Chevalier and Graesse.</p>

English translations in Newman, <i>Library of Fathers,</i> 2 (1838), one ref. p. 178. <i>Letter to Constantine II. concerning the sign of the cross seen at Jerusalem,</i> c 3. In Migne, <i>Patrol. Gr.</i> 33 (1857), 1165&#8211;1176, ref. on 1167&#8211;1168. Two or three references only to excavation of the cross and building of churches, &amp;c., at Jerusalem. They take significance only in the fact that Cyril is so near the time (the letter was 351 [?], or not many years later), and delivered his lectures in the very church which Constantine had built (sect. 14, 22).</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p29"></A>Compare Schaff, <i>Hist. of Church,</i> 3 (1884) 923&#8211;925; Venables, in Smith &amp; W. 1 (1887), 760&#8211;763; and literature in Chevalier Schaff, &amp;c.; also editions in Graesse, Hoffmann, &amp;c.</p>

Lat.</i> 16 (1866), portion relating to Constantine especially, 1462&#8211;1465. Relates chiefly to the Finding of the Cross.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p31"></A>Compare Davies, in Smith &amp; W. 1 (1877), 91&#8211;99; also Chevalier, Engelmann, Schoenemann, &amp;c.</p>

Lat.</i> 27 (1866). Part relating to Constantine, 493 (497)&#8211;500. A translation and continuation of the <i>Chronicle</i> of Eusebius, who ends with the death of Licinius. An indispensable but aggravating authority.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p33"></A>Compare Salmon, <i>Eusebius, Chronicle of,</i> in Smith &amp; W. 2 (1880), 348&#8211;355.</p>

Migne, 33 (1865), 159&#8211; , &sect;&sect;4, 5, 20, &amp;c. He gives account of the various Donatist hearings, and speaks of having read aloud from various original documents, including the petition to Constantine, the proconsular acts, the proceedings of the court at Rome, and the letters of Constantine. He speaks of the hearing at Milan. <i>Ep.</i> 88, ed. Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat.</i> 33 (1865), 302&#8211;309. This has the text of letter of Anulinus to Constantine and Constantine to Probianus. <i>Eps.</i> 76. 2; 93. 13&#8211;14, 16 (which contains account of decree of Constantine that property of obstinate Donatists should be confiscated); 105. 9, 10 (not translated); 141. 8&#8211;10 (not translated), in ed. Migne, and tr. English ed. Schaff, contain various matter on the Donatist acts of Constantine. <i>Ad Donatistas post collationem,</i> c. 33, &sect;56; ed. Migne, 43 (1861), 687 (important for <i>dates</i> given). <i>Contra litt. Petil.</i> Bk. II. ch. 92, &sect;205; ed. Migne, 45 (1861), 326.

For literature see Schaff, Chevalier, Engelmann, and for particular literature of the Donatist portions, Hartranft, in Schaff, <i>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers,</i> 4 (1887), 369&#8211;372; and for editions, see Schoenemann, Graesse, Brunet, Engelmann, Schaff, Hartranft, &amp;c.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p36"></A>The equally numerous series of non-Christian writers is headed, in value at least, though not in time, by Constantine&#146;s secretary.</p>

Multitudes of editions and translations; the ones used are: (Paris, 1539), 63&#8211;68; transl. by Watson, (Bohn, 1853), 527&#8211;535. Eutropius was secretary to Constantine, and afterwards the intimate of Julian. His testimony, though brief, is of peculiar weight from his position for knowing and from a certain flavor of fairness. It was early remarked (Nicephorus Gregoras) that his praise of Constantine had peculiar force, coming from a heathen and friend of Julian. His dispraise, on the other hand, is conditioned by the fact that he applies it only to the period after Constantine began peculiarly to favor the Christians. He seems to be a cool, level-headed man of the world, unsympathetic with Constantine&#146;s religion and, writing <i>from this standpoint,</i> presents a just, candid, reliable account of him.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.v.ii-p38"></A>Compare Ramsay, in Smith, <i>Dict.</i> 2 (1859), 126&#8211;127; Watson, <i>Notice,</i> in his translations; also for multitudinous editions and translations, and relatively scanty though considerable literature, Chevalier, Engelmann, Graesse.</p>

These works, by different authors, have been associated since the time of the above edition with the name of Victor. The former is by him, the latter probably by a slightly later Victor. They use the same sources with Zosimus, but supplement him (Wordsworth). Both are interesting and important, and in Manso&#146;s judgment, final where they agree.</p>

He wrote various works in the Ionic dialect, among others a &#8220;history of the deeds of Constantine the Great, in two books,&#8221; composed at the age of twenty-two. The fragments or <i>resum&eacute;</i> are preserved by Photius, as above. Though brief (three columns), it is a concise mass of testimony.</p>

Orations on Constantius and Constantinus, et pass.</i> Ed. Paris, 1630, p. 12&#8211;96, 422; Vol. 2, 1&#8211;54, <i>passim.</i> Compare also ed. Hertlein, Lips. 1875&#8211;76, 2 v. 8vo. Editions and translations are very numerous. (Compare arts. of Wordsworth and Graves; also Engelmann, Graesse, &amp;c. The orations which are panegyrical were delivered (Wordsworth) 355 and 358, and the <i>C&aelig;sars</i> dates from shortly after his accession (in 361). The latter is a satire which has found literary favor, the substantial purpose of which is thought to be a suggestion that he (Julian) is much superior to all the great emperors; but which if one were to venture a guess at its real motive is quite as much a systematic effort to minimize by ridicule the lauded Constantine. The laudatory words of Julian himself in his orations are quite overshadowed by the bitter sarcasms of the C&aelig;sars. As a matter of estimate of the value of this source, there is to be remembered the bitterness of Julian&#146;s hostility to Christianity. What to Eusebius was a virtue would to Julian be a vice. In view of his prejudice, everything which he concedes is of primary weight, while his ill-natured gossip carries a presumption of slanderousness.</p>

But with its additions of arrantly apocryphal matter, it is hard to tell what is what, and so all considerable mention of the relation of Constantine and Tiridates has been left out of the account of Constantine&#146;s life. Yet we must hesitate to put it all down under the mythical; for Tiridates certainly had intercourse with the Romans, and the original form of this life was certainly by a competent hand, and the matter relating to Constantine is in part soberly historical enough.</p>

It will be safe to divide extremes. He is a heathen who, on the period of Constantine, draws from an anti-Christian and anti-Constantinian source, and who regards the introduction of Christianity as a chief cause of the decline of the Roman Empire (cf. various passages cited by Milligan). He is prejudiced against Christianity with the bitter prejudice of one who finds himself in a steadily narrowing minority, and he is occasionally credulous. But he wrote in a clear, interesting style, without intentional falsifications, and was quite as moderate as the Christian writer (Evagrius 3. 41) who calls Zosimus himself a &#8220;fiend of hell.&#8221; His extended account is therefore of great value among the sources, and especially as it is probably drawn in large measure from the earlier lost work of Eunapius.</p>

Theophanes was friend of Georgius Syncellus; and at his request (Pr&#339;m. p. 5) took up the latter work at the point where he left off (Diocletian), extending it to 811. He is an authority of judgment and weight for matters relating to his own times, and on quite a different level of historical character from Cedrenus and Zonaras. Although of very much less value for Constantine, he shows even here a certain historical judgment and discrimination. His book is an intelligent work from various sources, one of which is Eusebius. He says that he has diligently examined many works, and reports nothing on his own authority, but on the authority of ancient historiographers and &#8220;logographers&#8221; (Pr&#339;m. p. 5).</p>

This work consists of eighteen books extending from the beginning of the world until 1118.

He mentions the work of Joannes Thracesius, or Curopalates, who is probably Scylitzes, whose work corresponds so exactly with that of Cedrenus in parts as to suggest the one or the other a better copier than compiler. The statement of Ceillier is that Cedrenus copied the work of Scylitzes for the period 811&#8211;1057, and that Scylitzes afterwards continued his work to 1081; i.e. there was a double edition of the work of Scylitzes, and Cedrenus wrote between.

While one hesitates to lay much weight on an author of such unknown age and personality, and which contains obvious errors, yet it carries the conviction of a certain moderate weight. Many passages are identical, almost word for word, with Cedrenus. In one of these passages the author refers to Socrates as his authority, while there is no such mention in Cedrenus. They may have taken from the same source. At all events, this work appears on its face much more like sober history than do Cedrenus and Zonaras. Its absolute value as source is very slight.</p>

Though &#8220;justly placed among the better Byzantine historians&#8221; (Plate), for the period of Constantine he is one of the worst. His critical judgment seems to incline to the selection of the most unhistoric. He gives at end of preceding section a description of the work of Scylitzes (cf. Cedrenus), and quotes in it a work of Alexander on the Invention of the Cross.</p>

It was first edited by Mai, <i>Scr. vet. nov. coll</i>. 3 (1828), 1&#8211;225 (Dowl.). This metrical chronicle introduces one or two fables, but is in the main at least semi-historical, but its additional facts give no impression of having special sources,&#8212;in brief, it is scarcely a source, rather literature.</p>
