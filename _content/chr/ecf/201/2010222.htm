The epistle mentioned here must be the one referred to in chap. 2 and must have been devoted chiefly to the question of the re-baptism of heretics or schismatics (<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xii.v-p3.3"></A>&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8059;&#964;&#959;&#965;</span> referring evidently to the subject spoken of in the previous chapter). But Eusebius quite irrelevantly quotes from the epistle a passage not upon the subject in hand, but upon an entirely different one, viz. upon the peace which had been established in the Eastern churches, after the disturbances caused by the schism of Novatian (see Bk. VI. chap. 43 sq.). That the peace spoken of in this epistle cannot mean, as Baronius held, that the Eastern churches had come over to Stephen&#146;s opinion in regard to the subject of baptism is clear enough from the fact that Dionysius wrote another epistle to Stephen&#146;s successor (see the next chapter) in which he still defended the practice of re-baptism. In fact, the passage quoted by Eusebius from Dionysius&#146; epistle to Stephen has no reference to the subject of baptism.</p>
