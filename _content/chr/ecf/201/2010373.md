<span id="iv.iii.iv.vii-p1"></span> 6. *Voyage of Helena*.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.vii-p2"></span>A matter-of-fact account of things
which are not so, given in Hakluyt’s *Voyages*, 2 (1810), p. 34, is
worth giving in the words of the translator:

<span id="iv.iii.iv.vii-p3"></span>“Helena Flavia Augusta, the heire and
onely daughter of Cœlus, sometime the most excellent king of Britaine,
by reason of her singular beautie, faith, religion, goodnesse, and godly
Maiestie (according to the testimonie of Eusebius) was famous in all the
world. Amongst all the women of her time there was none either in the
liberall arts more learned, or in the instruments of musike more
skilfull, or in the divers languages of nations more abundant than
herselfe. She had a naturall quicknesse of wit, eloquence of speech, and
a most notable grace in all her behaviour. She was seene in the Hebrew,
Greeke, and Latin tongues. Her father (as Virumnius reporteth) had no
other childe,…had by her a sonne called Constantine the great, while hee
remained in Britaine…peace was granted to the Christian churches by her
good meanes. After the light and knowledge of the Gospel, she grew so
skilfull in divinity that she wrote and composed divers bookes and
certaine Greeke verses also, which (as Ponticus reporteth) are yet
extant…went to Jerusalem…lived to the age of fourscore years, and then
died at Rome the <span id="page_444">p. 444</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv.vii-Page_444"></span>fifteenth day of August, in the yeere
of oure redemption 337…Her body is to this day very carefully preserved
at Venice.”
