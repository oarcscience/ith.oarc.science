<span id="iv.vi.iii.lii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LII</span>.—*Constantine’s Letter
to Eusebius concerning Mambre.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.lii-p2.1"></span>Victor Constantinus, Maximus
Augustus</span>, to Macarius, and the rest of the bishops in
Palestine. <span id="fr_3285"></span>[3286](#fn_3285)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lii-p4"></span>“One benefit, and that of no ordinary
importance, has been conferred on us by my truly pious
mother-in-law, <span id="fr_3286"></span>[3287](#fn_3286) in that she
has made known to us by letter that abandoned folly of impious men which
has hitherto escaped detection by you: so that the criminal conduct thus
overlooked may now through our means obtain fitting correction and
remedy, necessary though tardy. For surely it is a grave impiety indeed,
that holy places should be defiled by the stain of unhallowed
impurities. What then is this, dearest brethren, which, though it has
eluded your sagacity, she of whom I speak was impelled by a pious sense
of duty to disclose?

<span id="iv.vi.iii.lii-p3"></span> The writer of this history says the
letter was addressed to him, while it is really to Macarius. On this
ground the Eusebian authorship of the book has been challenged, but of
course Eusebius is among “the rest of the bishops.”
