<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXI</span>.—*That these Things
cannot have been spoken of a Mere Man: and that Unbelievers, owing to
their Ignorance of Religion, know not even the Origin of their own
Existence.*

<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xxi-p2.1"></span>It</span> may be some will foolishly suppose
that these words were spoken of the birth of a mere ordinary mortal. But
if this were all, what reason could there be that the earth should need
neither seed nor plough, that the vine should require no pruning-hook,
or other means of culture? How can we suppose these things to be spoken
of a mere mortal’s birth? For nature is the minister of the Divine will,
not an instrument obedient to the command of man. Indeed, the very joy
of the elements indicates the advent of God, not the conception of a
human being. The prayer, too, of the poet that his life might be
prolonged is a proof of the Divinity of him whom he invoked; for we
desire life and preservation from God, and not from man. Indeed, the
Erythræan Sibyl thus appeals to God: “Why, O Lord, dost thou compel me
still to foretell the future, and not rather remove me from this earth
to await the blessed day of thy coming?” And Maro adds to what he had
said before:

<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p3"></span><span id="page_578">p. 578</span> <span
id="iv.vii.xxi-Page_578"></span>Begin, sweet boy! with smiles thy mother
know,

<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p4"></span>Who ten long months did with thy burden
go.

<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p5"></span>No mortal parents smiled upon thy birth:

<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p6"></span>No nuptial joy thou know’st, no feast of
earth.

<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p7"></span>How could his parents have smiled on
him? For his Father <span id="fr_3478"></span>[3479](#fn_3478) is God,
who is a Power without sensible quality, <span
id="fr_3479"></span>[3480](#fn_3479) existing, not in any definite
shape, but as comprehending other beings, <span
id="fr_3480"></span>[3481](#fn_3480) and not, therefore, in a human
body. And who knows not that the Holy Spirit has no participation in the
nuptial union? For what desire can exist in the disposition of that good
which all things else desire? What fellowship, in short, can wisdom hold
with pleasure? But let these arguments be left to those who ascribe to
him a human origin, and who care not to purify themselves from all evil
in word as well as deed. On thee, Piety, I call to aid my words, on thee
who art the very law of purity, most desirable of all blessings, teacher
of holiest hope, assured promise of immortality! Thee, Piety, and thee,
Clemency, I adore. We who have obtained thine aid <span
id="fr_3481"></span>[3482](#fn_3481) owe thee everlasting gratitude for
thy healing power. But the multitudes whom their innate hatred of
thyself deprives of thy succor, are equally estranged from God himself,
and know not that the very cause of their life and being, and that of
all the ungodly, is connected with the rightful worship of him who is
Lord of all: for the world itself is his, and all that it contains.

<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p8"></span> “Father” is emendation of Valesius
embodied in his translation (1659), but not his text (1659). It is
bracketed by *Molz.* “His God \[and Father\].”

<span id="fn_3479"></span>[578:3480](2010683.htm#fr_3479) <span
id="iv.vii.xxi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p9"></span> “Pure force.”

<span id="fn_3480"></span>[578:3481](2010683.htm#fr_3480) <span
id="iv.vii.xxi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p10"></span> In this form it sounds much like
Pantheism, but in translation of *Molz.* this reads, “but determinable
through the bounds of other \[existences\].”

<span id="fn_3481"></span>[578:3482](2010683.htm#fr_3481) <span
id="iv.vii.xxi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xxi-p11"></span> So Valesius conjectures it should
read, but the text of *Val.* and *Hein.* read, “We needy ones owe,” &c.
