id="iv.vi.ii.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XL</span>.—*The Tombs of Martyrs
and the Cemeteries to be transferred to the Possession of the Churches.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xl-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xl-p2.1"></span>Again</span>, with respect to those places
which are honored in being the depositories of the remains of martyrs,
and continue to be memorials of their glorious departure; how can we
doubt that they rightly belong to the churches, or refrain from issuing
our injunction to that effect? For surely there can be no better
liberality, no labor more pleasing or profitable, than to be thus
employed under the guidance of the Divine Spirit, in order that those
things which have been appropriated on false pretenses by unjust and
wicked men, may be restored, as justice demands, and once more secured
to the holy churches.
