<span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p1"></span> §7. *Fifth Five Years.*

<span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p2"></span>The beginning of this period was the
beginning of the series of acts which have taken most from the
reputation of Constantine. Sometime in 326, perhaps while at Rome, he
ordered the death of his son Crispus. <span
id="fr_3033"></span>[3034](#fn_3033) The same year (Hieron. *Chron.*)
the Cæsar Licinius, his sister’s son, was put to death (Eutrop. 10. 6;
Hieron.; Prosper.), and shortly after <span
id="fr_3034"></span>[3035](#fn_3034) his wife Fausta died or was put to
death. <span id="fr_3035"></span>[3036](#fn_3035) But apart from this
shadow, the period was hardly less brilliant, in its way, than preceding
ones. It was a time of gigantic and, as some said, extravagant internal
improvements. Among various enterprises was the refounding, in 327, of
Drepanum, his mother’s city, as Helenopolis (Hieron. An. 2343; *Chron.
Pasch.* p. 283(?); Socr. *H. E.* 1. 18; Soz. 2. 2; Theoph. p. 41), and
greatest of all, the transformation of the insignificant Byzantium into
the magnificent Constantinople, <span
id="fr_3036"></span>[3037](#fn_3036) which was dedicated in 330
(Idatius; *Chron. Pasch.* p. 285; Hesych. §42; Hieron.; cf.
Clinton). <span id="fr_3037"></span>[3038](#fn_3037) It was probably
during this period, too, that the work of improvement in Jerusalem was
undertaken, and Helena made her famous visit thither (Euseb. *V. C.* 3.
42; Soz. 21; Socr. 1. 17; Ephraem. p. 24: Theoph. 37–8, &c.).

<span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p3"></span> Crispus was alive and in power March
1, 326, as appears from coins (cf. Eckhel, 8, p. 101–2). Whether he was
put to death before the Vicennalia does not appear, but that he was is
not probable. For death of Crispus and its date, compare Zos. 2. 29;
Vict. *Cæs*.; Soz. 1. 5; Vict. *Epit.* p. 50; *Chron. Pasch.;* Eutrop.
10. 6, &c., and discussion under *Character.*

<span id="fn_3034"></span>[419:3035](2010348.htm#fr_3034) <span
id="iv.iii.i.vii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p4"></span> The same year according to Greg. Tur.
(1. 34). Cf. Eutrop. and Sidon. 327, and even 328, is the date given by
some (cf. Clinton, v. 1, p. 382, and Wordsworth).

<span id="fn_3035"></span>[419:3036](2010348.htm#fr_3035) <span
id="iv.iii.i.vii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p5"></span> Disputed, but generally allowed. On
this series of deaths, compare the somewhat opposite views of Görres and
Seeck in the articles mentioned under *Literature* for latest views.

<span id="fn_3036"></span>[419:3037](2010348.htm#fr_3036) <span
id="iv.iii.i.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p6"></span> The date of the beginning of the work
is curiously uncertain. Socrates (1. 6) puts it directly after the
Council of Nicæa, and Philostorgius in 334, while there is almost equal
variety among the modern historians. Burckhardt says Nov. 4, 326; De
Broglie, 328 or 329; Wordsworth as early as 325. It is possible that the
strangeness which he felt in visiting Rome in 326, and the hostility
with which he was met there (Zos. 2. 29, 30), may have been a moving
cause in the foundation of this “New Rome,” and that it was begun soon
after his visit there. He first began to build his capital near the site
of Ilium (Soz. 2. 3; Zos. 2. 30), but “led by the hand of God” (Soz.),
he changed his plan to that city whose site he so much admired (Soz.).

Constantinople, see Soz. 2. 3; Philostorgius, 2. 9; Malalas, 13. 5;
Glycas, p. 462–64; Cedrenus, p. 495–98; Theoph. 41–42. Compare Zosimus,
2. 30; Anon. Vales. p. 475–76; Socrates, 1. 16; Orosius, c. 28;
Praxagoras, Zononas, Codinus, Nicephoras Callistus, &c.
