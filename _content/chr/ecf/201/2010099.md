<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX.—</span>*The Apostles that
were Married.*

<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.xxx-p2.1"></span>Clement</span>, indeed, whose words we
have just quoted, after the above-mentioned facts gives a statement, on
account of those who rejected marriage, of the apostles that had
wives. <span id="fr_846"></span>[847](#fn_846) <span id="page_162">p.
162</span> <span id="iii.viii.xxx-Page_162"></span>“Or will they,” says
he, <span id="fr_847"></span>[848](#fn_847) “reject even the apostles?
For Peter <span id="fr_848"></span>[849](#fn_848) and Philip <span
id="fr_849"></span>[850](#fn_849) begat children; and Philip also gave
his daughters in marriage. And Paul does not hesitate, in one of his
epistles, to greet his wife, <span id="fr_850"></span>[851](#fn_850)
whom he did not take about with him, that he might not be inconvenienced
in his ministry.”

<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p9"></span>2. And since we have mentioned this
subject it is not improper to subjoin another account which is given by
the same author and which is worth reading. In the seventh book of his
Stromata he writes as follows: <span id="fr_851"></span>[852](#fn_851)
“They say, accordingly, that when the blessed Peter saw his own wife led
out to die, he rejoiced because of her summons and her return home, and
called to her very encouragingly and comfortingly, addressing her by
name, and saying, ‘Oh thou, remember the Lord.’ Such was the marriage of
the blessed, and their perfect disposition toward those dearest to
them.” This account being in keeping with the subject in hand, I have
related here in its proper place.

<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p3"></span> A chapter intervenes between the
quotation given by Eusebius just above and the one which follows. In it
Clement had referred to two classes of heretics,—without giving their
names,—one of which encouraged all sorts of license, while the other
taught celibacy. Having in that place refuted the former class, he
devotes the chapter from which the following quotation is taken to a
refutation of the latter, deducing against them the fact that some of
the apostles were married. Clement here, as in his *Quis dives salvetur*
(quoted in chap. 23), shows his good common sense which led him to avoid
the extreme of asceticism as well as that of license. He was in this an
exception to most of the Fathers of his own and subsequent ages, who in
their reaction from the licentiousness of the times advised and often
encouraged by their own example the most rigid asceticism, and thus laid
the foundation for monasticism.

<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p4"></span> *Strom.*III. 6.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[162:849](2010099.htm#fr_848) <span
id="iii.viii.xxx-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p5"></span> Peter was married, as we know from
[Matt. 8:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014), [1 Cor.
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005)<span
id="iii.viii.xxx-p5.1"></span>[1 Cor. ix.
5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005)<span
id="iii.viii.xxx-p5.2"></span>). Tradition also tells us of a daughter,
St. Petronilla. She is first called St. Peter’s daughter in the
Apocryphal *Acts of SS. Nereus and Achilles,* which give a legendary
account of her life and death. In the Christian cemetery of Flavia
Domitilla was buried an *Aurelia Petronilla filia dulcissima,* and
Petronilla being taken as a diminutive of Petrus, she was assumed to
have been a daughter of Peter. It is probable that this was the origin
of the popular tradition. Petronilla is not, however, a diminutive of
Petrus, and it is probable that this woman was one of the Aurelian gens
and a relative of Flavia Domitilla. Compare the article *Petronilla* in
the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.* Petronilla has played a prominent rôle in
art. The immense painting by Guercino in the Palace of the Conservators
in Rome attracts the attention of all visitors.

id="iii.viii.xxx-p5.3"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p6"></span> It is probable that Clement here
confounds Philip the evangelist with Philip the apostle. See the next
chapter, note 6.

<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p7"></span>Philip the evangelist, according to
<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p7.1"></span>[Acts xxi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#009)<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p7.2"></span>,
had four daughters who were virgins. Clement (assuming that he is
speaking of the same Philip) is the only one to tell us that they
afterward married, and he tells us nothing about their husbands.
Polycrates in the next chapter states that two of them at least remained
virgins. If so, Clement’s statement can apply at most only to the other
two. Whether his report is correct as respects them we cannot tell.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[162:851](2010099.htm#fr_850) <span
id="iii.viii.xxx-p7.3"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p8"></span> The passage to which Clement here
refers and which he quotes in this connection is <span
id="iii.viii.xxx-p8.1"></span>[1 Cor. ix.
5](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#005)<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p8.2"></span>;
but this by no means proves that Paul was married, and [1 Cor. vii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#008)<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p8.3"></span>
seems to imply the opposite, though the words might be used if he were a
widower. The words of [Philip. iv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003)<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p8.4"></span>
are often quoted as addressed to his wife, but there is no authority for
such a reference. Clement is the only Father who reports that Paul was
married; many of them expressly deny it; e.g. Tertullian, Hilary,
Epiphanius, Jerome, &c. The authority of these later Fathers is of
course of little account. But Clement’s conclusion is based solely upon
exegetical grounds, and therefore is no argument for the truth of the
report.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[162:852](2010099.htm#fr_851) <span
id="iii.viii.xxx-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xxx-p10"></span> *Strom.*VII. 11. Clement, so far as
we know, is the only one to relate this story, but he bases it upon
tradition, and although its truth cannot be proved, there is nothing
intrinsically improbable in it.
