<span id="iii.xv.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xv.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—</span>*The Final Destruction of
the Enemies of Religion.*

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xv.xi-p2.1"></span>Thus</span> when Maximinus, who alone had
remained of the enemies of religion <span
id="fr_2788"></span>[2789](#fn_2788) and had appeared the worst of them
all, was put out of the way, the renovation of the churches from their
foundations was begun by the grace of God the Ruler of all, and the word
of Christ, shining unto the glory of the God of the universe, obtained
greater freedom than before, <span id="page_368">p. 368</span> <span
id="iii.xv.xi-Page_368"></span>while the impious enemies of religion
were covered with extremest shame and dishonor.

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p4"></span>2. For Maximinus himself, being first
pronounced by the emperors a common enemy, was declared by public
proclamations to be a most impious, execrable, and God-hating tyrant.
And of the portraits which had been set up in every city in honor of him
or of his children, some were thrown down from their places to the
ground, and torn in pieces; while the faces of others were obliterated
by daubing them with black paint. And the statues which had been erected
to his honor were likewise overthrown and broken, and lay exposed to the
laughter and sport of those who wished to insult and abuse them.

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p5"></span>3. Then also all the honors of the other
enemies of religion were taken away, and all those who sided with
Maximinus were slain, especially those who had been honored by him with
high offices in reward for their flattery, and had behaved insolently
toward our doctrine.

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p6"></span>4. Such an one was Peucetius, <span
id="fr_2789"></span>[2790](#fn_2789) the dearest of his companions, who
had been honored and rewarded by him above all, who had been consul a
second and third time, and had been appointed by him chief
minister; <span id="fr_2790"></span>[2791](#fn_2790) and
Culcianus, <span id="fr_2791"></span>[2792](#fn_2791) who had likewise
advanced through every grade of office, and was also celebrated for his
numberless executions of Christians in Egypt; <span
id="fr_2792"></span>[2793](#fn_2792) and besides these not a few others,
by whose agency especially the tyranny of Maximinus had been confirmed
and extended.

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p11"></span>5. And Theotecnus <span
id="fr_2793"></span>[2794](#fn_2793) also was summoned by justice which
by no means overlooked his deeds against the Christians. For when the
statue had been set up by him at Antioch, <span
id="fr_2794"></span>[2795](#fn_2794) he appeared to be in the happiest
state, and was already made a governor by Maximinus.

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p14"></span>6. But Licinius, coming down to the city
of Antioch, made a search for impostors, and tortured the prophets and
priests of the newly erected statue, asking them for what reason they
practiced their deception. They, under the stress of torture, were
unable longer to conceal the matter, and declared that the whole
deceptive mystery had been devised by the art of Theotecnus. Therefore,
after meting out to all of them just judgment, he first put Theotecnus
himself to death, and then his confederates in the imposture, with the
severest possible tortures.

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p15"></span>7. To all these were added also the
children <span id="fr_2795"></span>[2796](#fn_2795) of Maximinus, whom
he had already made sharers in the imperial dignity, by placing their
names on tablets and statues. And the relatives of the tyrant, who
before had been boastful and had in their pride oppressed all men,
suffered the same punishments with those who have been already
mentioned, as well as the extremest disgrace. For they had not received
instruction, neither did they know and understand the exhortation given
in the Holy Word:

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p17"></span>8. “Put not your trust in princes, nor
in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation; his spirit shall go
forth and return to his earth; in that day all their thoughts
perish.” <span id="fr_2796"></span>[2797](#fn_2796)

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p19"></span>9. The impious ones having been thus
removed, the government was preserved firm and undisputed for
Constantine and Licinius, to whom it fittingly belonged. They, having
first of all cleansed the world of hostility to the Divine Being,
conscious of the benefits which he had conferred upon them, showed their
love of virtue and of God, and their piety and gratitude to the Deity,
by their ordinance in behalf of the Christians. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2788"></span>[367:2789](2010296.htm#fr_2788) <span
id="iii.xv.xi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p3"></span> Maximian died in 310 (see above, Bk.
VIII. chap. 13, note 23), Galerius in 311 (see *ibid.* chap. 16, note
5), Maxentius in 312 (see above, chap. 9, note 7), and Diocletian early
in 313 (see Bk. VIII. App. note 3).

<span id="fn_2789"></span>[368:2790](2010296.htm#fr_2789) <span
id="iii.xv.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p7"></span> Of this Peucetius (Rufinus *Peucedius*)
we know only what is told us here. Valesius says: “The name is to be
rendered *Picentius,* a name which was borne by a certain *calumniator*
in the time of Constantine, as is stated by Zosimus at the end of his
second book. The Latins, indeed, call them *Picentes* whom the Greeks
call <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xv.xi-p7.1"></span>Πυκετίους</span>.”

<span id="fn_2790"></span>[368:2791](2010296.htm#fr_2790) <span
id="iii.xv.xi-p7.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p8"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xv.xi-p8.1"></span>τῶν καθόλου λόγων žπαρχος</span>, apparently
equivalent to the phrase <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xv.xi-p8.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xv.xi-p8.3"></span>πὶ τῶν καθόλου λόγων</span>, used in Bk. VII.
chap. 10, §5. On its significance, see the note on that passage, and cf.
Valesius’ note *ad locum*.

<span id="fn_2791"></span>[368:2792](2010296.htm#fr_2791) <span
id="iii.xv.xi-p8.4"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p9"></span> This same Culcianus appears in the *Acts
of St. Phileas of Thmuis* (Ruinart, p. 434 sq.; see the extract printed
in Mason, p. 290 sq.) as the magistrate or governor under whom Phileas
suffered in Thebais. He is doubtless to be identified, as Valesius
remarks, with Culeianus (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xv.xi-p9.1"></span>Κουληιανός</span>) mentioned by Epiphanius
(*Hær.* LXVIII. 1) as governor of Thebais at the time of the rise of the
Meletian schism, while Hierocles was governor of Alexandria.

<span id="fn_2792"></span>[368:2793](2010296.htm#fr_2792) <span
id="iii.xv.xi-p9.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p10"></span> Culcianus seems to have been governor
of Thebais (where Phileas suffered, according to Bk. VIII. chap. 9), not
of Egypt. Possibly Eusebius employs the word Egypt in its general sense,
as including Thebais.

<span id="fn_2793"></span>[368:2794](2010296.htm#fr_2793) <span

4.

<span id="fn_2795"></span>[368:2796](2010296.htm#fr_2795) <span
id="iii.xv.xi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xv.xi-p16"></span> Lactantius (*De mort. pers.* chap. 50)
tells us that Maximin left a wife and two children, a boy eight years
old, named Maximus, and a daughter seven years old who was betrothed to
Candidianus.
