<span id="iv.vi.ii.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIV</span>.—*What Vengeance
overtook those who on Account of the Oracle raised the Persecution.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.liv-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.liv-p2.1"></span>But</span> why need I longer dwell on
these lamentable events, and the general sorrow which in consequence
pervaded the world? The perpetrators of this dreadful guilt are now no
more: they have experienced a miserable end, and are consigned to
unceasing punishment in the depths of the lower world. They encountered
each other in civil strife, and have left neither name nor race behind.
And surely this calamity would never have befallen them, had not that
impious deliverance of the Pythian oracle exercised a delusive power
over them. <span id="fr_3200"></span>[3201](#fn_3200)
