<p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.i-p3"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.i-p3.1"></A>While</span> thus variously engaged in promoting the extension and glory of the church of God, and striving by every measure to commend the Saviour&#146;s doctrine, the emperor was far from neglecting secular affairs; but in this respect also he was unwearied in bestowing benefits of every kind and in quick succession on the people of every province. On the one hand he manifested a paternal anxiety for the general welfare of his subjects; on the other he would distinguish individuals of his own acquaintance with various marks of honor; conferring his benefits in every instance in a truly noble spirit. No one could request a favor from the emperor, and fail of obtaining what he sought: no one expected a boon from him, and found that expectation vain.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3307"></A><A HREF="#fn_3307"><FONT SIZE="1">3308</FONT></A>
 Some received presents in money, others in land; some obtained the Pr&aelig;torian pr&aelig;fecture, others senatorial, others again consular rank: many were appointed provincial governors: others were made counts of the first, second, or third order: in numberless instances the title of Most Illustrious and many other distinctions were conferred; for the emperor devised new dignities, that he might invest a larger number with the tokens of his favor.</p>
