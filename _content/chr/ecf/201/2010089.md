<span id="iii.viii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX.—</span>*The Relatives of our
Saviour.*

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p2"></span>1. “<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.xx-p2.1"></span>Of</span> the family of the Lord there were
still living the grandchildren of Jude, who is said to have been the
Lord’s brother according to the flesh. <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719)

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p4"></span>2. Information was given that they
belonged to the family of David, and they were brought to the Emperor
Domitian by the Evocatus. <span id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720) For
Domitian feared the com<span id="page_149">p. 149</span> <span
id="iii.viii.xx-Page_149"></span>ing of Christ as Herod also had feared
it. And he asked them if they were descendants of David, and they
confessed that they were. Then he asked them how much property they had,
or how much money they owned. And both of them answered that they had
only nine thousand denarii, <span id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721) half
of which belonged to each of them;

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p8"></span>4. and this property did not consist of
silver, but of a piece of land which contained only thirty-nine acres,
and from which they raised their taxes <span
id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722) and supported themselves by their own
labor.” <span id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723)

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p11"></span>5. Then they showed their hands,
exhibiting the hardness of their bodies and the callousness produced
upon their hands by continuous toil as evidence of their own labor.

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p12"></span>6. And when they were asked concerning
Christ and his kingdom, of what sort it was and where and when it was to
appear, they answered that it was not a temporal nor an earthly kingdom,
but a heavenly and angelic one, which would appear at the end of the
world, when he should come in glory to judge the quick and the dead, and
to give unto every one according to his works.

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p13"></span>7. Upon hearing this, Domitian did not
pass judgment against them, but, despising them as of no account, he let
them go, and by a decree put a stop to the persecution of the Church.

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p14"></span>8. But when they were released they
ruled the churches because they were witnesses <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724) and were also relatives of the
Lord. <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725) And peace being
established, they lived until the time of Trajan. These things are
related by Hegesippus.

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p17"></span>9. Tertullian also has mentioned
Domitian in the following words: <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726)
“Domitian also, who possessed a share of Nero’s cruelty, attempted once
to do the same thing that the latter did. But because he had, I suppose,
some intelligence, <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727) he very soon
ceased, and even recalled those whom he had banished.”

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p20"></span>10. But after Domitian had reigned
fifteen years, <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728) and Nerva had
succeeded to the empire, the Roman Senate, according to the writers that
record the history of those days, <span
id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729) voted that Domitian’s honors should be
cancelled, and that those who had been unjustly banished should return
to their homes and have their property restored to them.

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p23"></span>11. It was at this time that the
apostle John returned from his banishment in the island and took up his
abode at Ephesus, according to an ancient Christian tradition. <span

id="iii.viii.xx-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p3"></span> This Jude was the brother of James,
“the brother of the Lord,” who is mentioned in [Jude
1](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#001)<span id="iii.viii.xx-p3.1"></span>,
and is to be distinguished from Jude (Thaddeus-Lebbæus), one of the
Twelve, whose name appears in the catalogues of Luke ([Luke
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#014), [Acts
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013)<span
id="iii.viii.xx-p3.2"></span>[Luke vi.
14](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#014)<span id="iii.viii.xx-p3.3"></span>
and [Acts i. 13](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#013)<span
id="iii.viii.xx-p3.4"></span>) as the son of James (not his brother, as
the A.V. translates: the Greek words are <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xx-p3.5"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xx-p3.6"></span>Ιούδας ᾽Ιακώβου</span>). For a discussion
of the relationship of these men to Christ, see above, Bk. I. chap. 12,
note 14. Of the son of Jude and father of the young men mentioned in
this chapter we know nothing.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[148:721](2010089.htm#fr_720) <span
id="iii.viii.xx-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p5"></span> According to Andrew’s Lexicon, “An
Evocatus was a soldier who, having served out his time, was called upon
to do military duty as a volunteer.”

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p6"></span>This suspiciousness is perfectly in
keeping with the character of Domitian. The same thing is told also of
Vespasian, in chap. 12; but in his case the political situation was far
more serious, and revolutions under the lead of one of the royal family
might most naturally be expected just after the terrible destruction.
The same act is also mentioned in connection with Trajan, in chap. 32,
and there is no reason to doubt its truthfulness, for the Jews were well
known as a most rebellious and troublesome people.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[149:722](2010089.htm#fr_721) <span
id="iii.viii.xx-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p7"></span> A denarius was a Roman silver coin, in
value about sixteen, or, according to others, about nineteen, cents.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[149:723](2010089.htm#fr_722) <span

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p9"></span> “Taxes or tributes were paid commonly
in the products of the land” (Val.).

<span id="fn_723"></span>[149:724](2010089.htm#fr_723) <span
id="iii.viii.xx-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.xx-p10"></span> Most editors (including Valesius,
Heinichen, Crusè, &c.) regard the quotation from Hegesippus as extending
through §8; but it really ends here, and from this point on Eusebius
reproduces the sense in his own words (and so Bright gives it in his
edition). This is perfectly clear, for in the first place, the
infinitive <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xx-p10.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.xx-p10.2"></span>πιδεικνῦναι</span> occurs in the next
sentence, a form possible only in indirect discourse: and secondly, as
Lightfoot has pointed out, the statement of §8 is repeated in chap. 32,
§6, and there in the exact language of Hegesippus, which differs enough
from the language of §8 to show that the latter is a free reproduction.
