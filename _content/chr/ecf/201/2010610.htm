<p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxiv-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxiv-p2.1"></A>Hence</span> it was not without reason that once, on the occasion of his entertaining a company of bishops, he let fall the expression, &#8220;that he himself too was a bishop,&#8221; addressing them in my hearing in the following words: &#8220;You are bishops whose jurisdiction is within the Church: I also am a bishop, ordained by God to overlook whatever is external to the Church.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3323"></A><A HREF="#fn_3323"><FONT SIZE="1">3324</FONT></A>
 And truly his measures corresponded with his words: for he watched over his subjects with an episcopal care, and exhorted them as far as in him lay to follow a godly life.</p>
