<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—</span>*The Illustrious
Bishops of that Time.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p2.1"></span>Of</span> these, the most eminent were
Firmilianus, <span id="fr_2380"></span>[2381](#fn_2380) bishop of
Cæsarea in Cappadocia; the brothers Gregory <span
id="fr_2381"></span>[2382](#fn_2381) and Athenodorus, pastors of the
churches in Pontus; Helenus <span id="fr_2382"></span>[2383](#fn_2382)
of the parish of Tarsus, and Nicomas <span
id="fr_2383"></span>[2384](#fn_2383) of Iconium; moreover,
Hymenæus, <span id="fr_2384"></span>[2385](#fn_2384) of the church of
Jerusalem, and Theotecnus <span id="fr_2385"></span>[2386](#fn_2385) of
the neighboring church of Cæsarea; and besides these Maximus, <span
id="fr_2386"></span>[2387](#fn_2386) who presided in a distinguished
manner over the brethren in Bostra. If any should count them up he could
not fail to note a great many others, besides presbyters and deacons,
who were at that time assembled for the same cause in the
above-mentioned city. <span id="fr_2387"></span>[2388](#fn_2387) But
<span id="page_313">p. 313</span> <span
id="iii.xii.xxix-Page_313"></span>these were the most illustrious.

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p11"></span>2. When all of these assembled at
different times and frequently to consider these matters, the arguments
and questions were discussed at every meeting; the adherents of the
Samosatian endeavoring to cover and conceal his heterodoxy, and the
others striving zealously to lay bare and make manifest his heresy and
blasphemy against Christ.

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p12"></span>3. Meanwhile, Dionysius died in the
twelfth year of the reign of Gallienus, <span
id="fr_2388"></span>[2389](#fn_2388) having held the episcopate of
Alexandria for seventeen years, and Maximus <span
id="fr_2389"></span>[2390](#fn_2389) succeeded him.

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p15"></span>4. Gallienus after a reign of fifteen
years <span id="fr_2390"></span>[2391](#fn_2390) was succeeded by
Claudius, <span id="fr_2391"></span>[2392](#fn_2391) who in two years
delivered the government to Aurelian.

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p3"></span> On Firmilianus, see Bk. VI. chap. 26,
note 3.

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p4"></span> Gregory Thaumaturgus. On him and his
brother, Athenodorus, see Bk. VI. chap. 30, notes 1 and 2.

<span id="fn_2382"></span>[312:2383](2010246.htm#fr_2382) <span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p5"></span> On Helenus, see Bk. VI. chap. 46,
note 8. He presided at the final council which deposed Paul of Samosata,
according to the *Libellus Synodicus* (see Labbe, *Concilia,* I. 893,
901), and this is confirmed by the fact that in the encyclical epistle
written by this synod his name stands first (see chap. 30).

<span id="fn_2383"></span>[312:2384](2010246.htm#fr_2383) <span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p6"></span> Of Nicomas, bishop of Iconium in
Lycaonia, we know nothing. An earlier bishop of the same city, named
Celsus, is mentioned in Book VI. chap. 19, above.

<span id="fn_2384"></span>[312:2385](2010246.htm#fr_2384) <span

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p7"></span> On Hymenæus, see chap. 14, note 11.

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p8"></span> On Theotecnus, see chap. 14, note 9.

<span id="fn_2386"></span>[312:2387](2010246.htm#fr_2386) <span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p9"></span> Of Maximus, bishop of Bostra, in
Arabia, we know nothing. On Beryllus, an earlier and more celebrated
bishop of the same city, see above, Bk. VI. chap. 33.

<span id="fn_2387"></span>[312:2388](2010246.htm#fr_2387) <span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p10"></span> i.e. Antioch.

<span id="fn_2388"></span>[313:2389](2010246.htm#fr_2388) <span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p13"></span> In both versions of the *Chron.* the
death of Dionysius is put in the eleventh year of Gallienus, i.e.
August, 263, to August, 264, and this, or the date given here by
Eusebius (the twelfth year, August, 264, to August, 265) is undoubtedly
correct. Upon the dates of his accession and death, see Bk. VI. chap.
40, note 1.

<span id="fn_2389"></span>[313:2390](2010246.htm#fr_2389) <span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p14"></span> Maximus had been a presbyter while
Dionysius was bishop of Alexandria, and had shared with him the
hardships of the Decian and Valerian persecutions (see above, chap. 11).
In chap. 32, he is said to have held office eighteen years, and with
this both versions of the *Chron.* agree, and there is no reason to
doubt the accuracy of the report.

<span id="fn_2390"></span>[313:2391](2010246.htm#fr_2390) <span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p16"></span> Eusebius here, as in his *Chron.,*
reckons the reign of Gallienus as beginning with the date of his
association with his father in the supreme power; i.e. August, 253.

<span id="fn_2391"></span>[313:2392](2010246.htm#fr_2391) <span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxix-p17"></span> Claudius became emperor in March,
268, and died of an epidemic in Sirmium some time in the year 270, when
he was succeeded by Aurelian, whom he had himself appointed his
successor just before his death. It is, perhaps, with this in mind that
Eusebius uses the somewhat peculiar phrase, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxix-p17.1"></span>μεταδίδωσι τὴν ἡγεμονίαν</span>
