id="iv.vi.i.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LV</span>.—*The Lawless Conduct and
Covetousness of Licinius.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.lv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.lv-p2.1"></span>Such</span> were the ordinances of Licinius.
But why should I enumerate his innovations respecting marriage, or those
concerning the dying, whereby he presumed to abrogate the ancient and
wisely established laws of the Romans, and to introduce certain
barbarous and cruel institutions in their stead, inventing a thousand
pretenses for oppressing his subjects? Hence it was that he devised a
new method of measuring land, by which he reckoned the smallest portion
at more than its actual dimensions, from an insatiable desire of
acquisition. Hence too he registered the names of country residents who
were now no more, and had long been numbered with the dead, procuring to
himself by this expedient a shameful gain. His meanness was unlimited
and his rapacity insatiable. So that when he had filled all his
treasuries with gold, and silver, and boundless wealth, he bitterly
bewailed his poverty, and suffered as it were the torments of Tantalus.
But why should I mention how many innocent persons he punished with
exile; how much property he confiscated; how many men of noble birth and
estimable character he imprisoned, whose wives he handed over to be
basely insulted by his profligate slaves, and to how many married women
and virgins he himself offered violence, though already feeling the
infirmities of age? I need not enlarge on these subjects, since the
enormity of his last actions causes the former to appear trifling and of
little moment. <span id="fr_3153"></span>[3154](#fn_3153)
