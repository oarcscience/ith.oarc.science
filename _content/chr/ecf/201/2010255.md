<span id="iii.xiii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter III.—</span>*The Nature of the
Conflicts endured in the Persecution.*

<span id="iii.xiii.iv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiii.iv-p2.1"></span>Then</span> truly a great many rulers of
the churches eagerly endured terrible sufferings, and furnished examples
of noble conflicts. But a multitude of others, <span
id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507) benumbed in spirit by fear, were
easily weakened at the first onset. Of the rest each one endured
different forms of torture. <span id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508)
The body of one was scourged with rods. Another was punished with
insupportable rackings and scrapings, in which some suffered a miserable
death.

<span id="iii.xiii.iv-p5"></span>2. Others passed through different
conflicts. Thus one, while those around pressed him on by force and
dragged him to the abominable and impure sacrifices, was dismissed as if
he had sacrificed, though he had not. <span
id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509) Another, though he had not
approached at all, nor touched any polluted <span id="page_326">p.
326</span> <span id="iii.xiii.iv-Page_326"></span>thing, when others
said that he had sacrificed, went away, bearing the accusation in
silence.

<span id="iii.xiii.iv-p7"></span>3. Another being taken up half dead,
was cast aside as if already dead, and again a certain one lying upon
the ground was dragged a long distance by his feet and counted among
those who had sacrificed. One cried out and with a loud voice testified
his rejection of the sacrifice; another shouted that he was a Christian,
being resplendent in the confession of the saving Name. Another
protested that he had not sacrificed and never would.

<span id="iii.xiii.iv-p8"></span>4. But they were struck in the mouth
and silenced by a large band of soldiers who were drawn up for this
purpose; and they were smitten on the face and cheeks and driven away by
force; so important did the enemies of piety regard it, by any means, to
seem to have accomplished their purpose. But these things did not avail
them against the holy martyrs; for an accurate description of whom, what
word of ours could suffice?

<span id="iii.xiii.iv-p4"></span> i.e. those who, when freedom was
offered them on condition of sacrificing, refused to accept it at that
price. It was desirous that the prisons which had for so long been
filled with these Christian prisoners (see chap. 6, §9) should, if
possible, be cleared; and this doubtless combined with the desire to
break the stubbornness of the prisoners to promote the use of torture at
this time.
