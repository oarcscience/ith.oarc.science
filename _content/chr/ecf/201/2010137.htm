 whom we have mentioned among the foregoing writers, a certain very elegant discourse is extant, which was written by him against some brethren that had gone over to the heresy of the so-called Encratites,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1321"></A><A HREF="#fn_1321"><FONT SIZE="1">1322</FONT></A>
 which had recently sprung up, and which introduced a strange and pernicious error. It is said that Tatian was the author of this false doctrine.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.ix.xxviii-p3"></A> Of this Musanus, we know only what Eusebius tells us here, for Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> 31) and Theodoret (<i>H&aelig;r. Fab.</i> I. 21) simply repeat the account of Eusebius. It is clear from Eusebius&#146; language, that he had not himself seen this work of Musanus; he had simply heard of it. Here, and in chap. 21, Eusebius assigns the activity of Musanus to the reign of Marcus Aurelius, making him a contemporary of Melito, Apolinarius, Iren&aelig;us, &amp;c. But in the <i>Chron.</i> he is put much later. The Armenian version, under the year of Abr. 2220 (the eleventh year of Septimius), has the entry <i>Musanus noster scriptor cognoscebatur.</i> Jerome, under the same year (2220 of Abr., but twelfth year of Severus) has <i>Musanus nostr&aelig; filosofi&aelig; scriptor agnoscitur;</i> while Syncellus, under the year of Abr. 2231 (fourth year of Caracalla) has <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.ix.xxviii-p3.1"></A>&#924;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#8056;&#962; &#7952;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962; &#963;&#965;&#947;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#949;&#965;&#962; &#7952;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#961;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span>. All of them, therefore, speak of Musanus (or Musianus) as a writer, but do not specify any of his works. The dates in the <i>Chron.</i> (whichever be taken as original) and in the <i>History</i> are not mutually exclusive; at the same time it is clear that Eusebius was not working upon the same information in the two cases. We have no means of testing the correctness of either statement.</p>
