<span id="iv.vi.ii.lix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIX</span>.—*He gives Glory to
God, as the Constant Teacher of Good.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lix-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lix-p2.1"></span>Abundant</span> thanks, most mighty God,
and Lord of all, be rendered to thee, that, by so much as our nature
becomes known from the diversified pursuits of man, by so much the more
are the precepts of thy divine doctrine confirmed to those whose
thoughts are directed aright, and who are sincerely devoted to true
virtue. As for those who will not allow themselves to be cured of their
error, let them not attribute this to any but themselves. For that
remedy which is of sovereign and healing virtue is openly placed within
the reach of all. Only let not any one inflict an injury on that
religion which experience itself testifies to be pure and undefiled.
Henceforward, therefore, let us all enjoy in common the privilege placed
within our reach, I mean the blessing of peace, endeavoring to keep our
conscience pure from all that is contrary.
