<p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxii-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xxii-p2.1"></A>Nor</span> did the imperial throne remain long unoccupied: for Constantine invested himself with his father&#146;s purple, and proceeded from his father&#146;s palace, presenting to all a renewal, as it were, in his own person, of his father&#146;s life and reign. He then conducted the funeral procession in company with his father&#146;s friends, some preceding, others following the train, and performed the last offices for the pious deceased with an extraordinary degree of magnificence, and all united in honoring this thrice blessed prince with acclamations and praises, and while with one mind and voice, they glorified the rule of the son as a living again of him who was dead, they hastened at once to hail their new sovereign by the titles of Imperial and Worshipful Augustus, with joyful shouts.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3098"></A><A HREF="#fn_3098"><FONT SIZE="1">3099</FONT></A>
 Thus the memory of the deceased emperor received honor from the praises bestowed upon his son, while the latter was pronounced blessed in being the successor of such a father. All the nations also under his dominion were filled with joy and inexpressible gladness at not being even for a moment deprived of the benefits of a well ordered government.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.vi.i.xxii-p4"></A>In the instance of the Emperor Constantius, God has made manifest to our generation what the end of those is who in their lives have honored and loved him.</p>
