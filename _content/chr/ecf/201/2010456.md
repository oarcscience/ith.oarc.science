<span id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*Flight, and Magic Arts
of Licinius.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xi-p2.1"></span>In</span> these circumstances their
commander, finding himself bereft of the aid of his followers, <span
id="fr_3169"></span>[3170](#fn_3169) having lost his lately numerous
array, both of regular and allied forces, having proved, too, by
experience, how vain his confidence had been in those whom he thought to
be gods, ignominiously took to flight, by which indeed he effected his
escape, and secured his personal safety, for the pious emperor had
forbidden his soldiers to follow him too closely, <span
id="fr_3170"></span>[3171](#fn_3170) and thus allowed him an opportunity
for escape. And this he did in the hope that he might hereafter, on
conviction of the desperate state of his affairs, be induced to abandon
his insane and presumptuous ambition, and return to sounder reason. So
Constantine, in his excessive humanity, thought and was willing
patiently to bear past injuries, and extend his forgiveness to one who
so ill deserved it; but Licinius, far from renouncing his evil
practices, still added crime to crime, and ventured on more daring
atrocities than ever. Nay, once more tampering with the detestable arts
of magic, he again was presumptuous: so that it might well be said of
him, as it was of the Egyptian tyrant of old, that God had hardened his
heart. <span id="fr_3171"></span>[3172](#fn_3171)
