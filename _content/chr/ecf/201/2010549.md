<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*Constantine’s Letter
to Macarius respecting the Building of the Church of our Saviour.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxx-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxx-p2.1"></span>Victor Constantius, Maximus
Augustus</span>, to Macarius.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxx-p3"></span>“Such is our Saviour’s grace, that no
power of language seems adequate to describe the wondrous circumstance
to which I am about to refer. For, that the monument of his most holy
Passion, so long ago buried beneath the ground, should have remained
unknown for so long a series of years, until its reappearance to his
servants now set free through the removal of him <span
id="fr_3262"></span>[3263](#fn_3262) who was the common enemy of all, is
a fact which truly surpasses all admiration. For if all who are
accounted wise throughout the world were to unite in their endeavors to
say somewhat worthy of this event, they would be unable to attain their
object in the smallest degree. Indeed, the nature of this miracle as far
transcends the capacity of human reason as heavenly things are superior
to human affairs. For this cause it is ever my first, and indeed my only
object, that, as the authority of the truth is evincing itself daily by
fresh wonders, so our souls may all become more zealous, with all
sobriety and earnest unanimity, for the honor of the Divine law. I
desire, therefore, especially, that you should be persuaded of that
which I suppose is evident to all beside, namely, that I have no greater
care than how I may best adorn with a splendid structure that sacred
spot, which, under Divine direction, I have disencumbered as it were of
the heavy weight of foul idol worship; a spot which has been accounted
holy from the beginning in God’s judgment, but which now appears holier
still, since it has brought to light a clear assurance of our Saviour’s
passion.
