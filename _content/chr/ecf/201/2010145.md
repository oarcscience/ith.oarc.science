<span id="iii.x.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—</span>*Irenæus commended by the
Witnesses in a Letter.*

<span id="iii.x.v-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.v-p2.1"></span>The</span> same witnesses also recommended
Irenæus, <span id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411) who was already at
that time a presbyter of the parish of Lyons, to the above-mentioned
bishop of Rome, saying many favorable things in regard to him, as the
following extract shows:

<span id="iii.x.v-p4"></span>2. “We pray, father Eleutherus, that you
may rejoice in God in all things and always. We have requested our
brother and comrade Irenæus to carry this letter to you, and we ask you
to hold him in esteem, as zealous for the covenant of Christ. For if we
thought that office could confer righteousness upon any one, we should
commend him among the first as a presbyter of the church, which is his
position.”

<span id="iii.x.v-p5"></span>3. Why should we transcribe the catalogue
of the witnesses given in the letter already mentioned, of whom some
were beheaded, others cast to the wild beasts, and others fell asleep in
prison, or give the number of confessors <span
id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412) still surviving at that time? For
whoever desires can readily find the full account by consulting the
letter itself, which, as I have said, is recorded in our Collection of
Martyrdoms. <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413) Such were the
events which happened under Antoninus. <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414)

technical term for confessors; i.e. for those who had been faithful and
had suffered in persecution, but had not lost their lives. In the
epistle of the churches of Lyons and Vienne, the word <span

expressly distinguishes from Marcus Aurelius at the beginning of the
next chapter. See below, p. 390, note.
