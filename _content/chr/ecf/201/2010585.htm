<p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxvi-p1"></A>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxvi-p1.1"></A>Chapter LXVI</span>.&#8212;<i>How on the Discovery of Prohibited Books among the Heretics, Many of them return to the Catholic Church.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxvi-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxvi-p2.1"></A>Thus</span> were the lurking-places of the heretics broken up by the emperor&#146;s command, and the savage beasts they harbored (I mean the chief authors of their impious doctrines) driven to flight. Of those whom they had deceived, some, intimidated by the emperor&#146;s threats, disguising their real sentiments, crept secretly into the Church. For since the law directed that search should be made for their books, those of them who practiced evil and forbidden arts were detected, and these were ready to secure their own safety by dissimulation of every kind.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3305"></A><A HREF="#fn_3305"><FONT SIZE="1">3306</FONT></A>
 Others, however, there were, who voluntarily and with real sincerity embraced a better hope. Meantime the prelates of the several churches continued to make strict inquiry, utterly rejecting those who attempted an entrance under the specious disguise of false pretenses, while those who came with sincerity of purpose were proved for a time, and after sufficient trial numbered with the congregation. Such was the treatment of those who stood charged with rank heresy: those, however, who maintained no impious doctrine, but had been separated from the one body through the influence of schismatic advisers, were received without difficulty or delay. Accordingly, numbers thus revisited, as it were, their own country after an absence in a foreign land, and acknowledged the Church as a mother from whom they had wandered long, and to whom they now returned with joy and gladness. Thus the members of the entire body became united, and compacted in one harmonious whole; and the one catholic Church, at unity with itself, shone with full luster, while no heretical or schismatic body anywhere continued to exist.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3306"></A><A HREF="#fn_3306"><FONT SIZE="1">3307</FONT></A>
 And the credit of having achieved this mighty work our Heaven-protected emperor alone, of all who had gone before him, was able to attribute to himself.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxvi-p3"></A> Here again it is worth noting, for history and for edification, that books were prohibited and heretics treated just as the Christians did not like to &#8220;be done by,&#8221; by the heathen.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.vi.iii.lxvi-p4"></A> This famous &#8220;church unity,&#8221; for which Constantine has been blessed or execrated, as the case might be, in all the ages since, was hardly more complete than modern unified churches where all the members held different pet doctrines and are prepared to fight for them to the bitter end.</p>
