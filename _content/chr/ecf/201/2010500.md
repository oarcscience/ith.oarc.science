<span id="iv.vi.ii.lv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LV</span>.—*Constantine gives Glory
to God, makes Grateful Acknowledgment of the Sign of the Cross, and
prays for the Churches and People.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lv-p2.1"></span>And</span> now I beseech thee, most mighty
God, to be merciful and gracious to thine Eastern nations, to thy people
in these provinces, worn as they are by protracted miseries; and grant
them healing through thy servant. Not without cause, O holy God, do I
prefer this prayer to thee, the Lord of all. Under thy guidance have I
devised and accomplished measures fraught with blessings: preceded by
thy sacred sign I have led thy armies to victory: and still, on each
occasion of public danger, I follow the same symbol of thy perfections
while advancing to meet the foe. Therefore have I dedicated to thy
service a soul duly attempered by love and fear. For thy name I truly
love, while I regard with reverence that power of which thou hast given
abundant proofs, to the confirmation and increase of my faith. I hasten,
then, to devote all my powers to the restoration of thy most holy
dwelling-place, which those profane and impious men have defiled by the
contamination of violence.
