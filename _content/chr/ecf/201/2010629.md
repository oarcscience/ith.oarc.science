<span id="iv.vi.iv.xliii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xliii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIII</span>.—*Bishops from all
the Provinces attended the Dedication of the Church at Jerusalem.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xliii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xliii-p2.1"></span>No</span> sooner had these injunctions
been carried into effect, than another emissary arrived with despatches
from the emperor, and an urgent admonition to the Council to hasten
their journey to Jerusalem without delay. <span
id="fr_3339"></span>[3340](#fn_3339) Accordingly they all took their
departure from the province of Phœnicia, and proceeded to their
destination, availing themselves of the public means of transport. Thus
Jerusalem became the gathering point for distinguished prelates from
every province, and the whole city was thronged by a vast assemblage of
the servants of God. The Macedonians had sent the bishop of their
metropolis; <span id="fr_3340"></span>[3341](#fn_3340) the Pannonians
and Mœsians the fairest of God’s youthful flock among them. A holy
prelate from Persia too was there, deeply versed in the sacred oracles;
while Bithynian and Thracian bishops graced the Council with their
presence; nor were the most illustrious from Cilicia wanting, nor the
chief of the Cappadocians, distinguished above all for learning and
eloquence. In short, the whole of Syria and Mesopotamia, Phœnicia and
Arabia, Palestine, Egypt, and Libya, with the dwellers in the Thebaid,
all contributed to swell the mighty concourse of God’s ministers,
followed as they were by vast numbers from every province. They were
attended by an imperial escort, <span
id="fr_3341"></span>[3342](#fn_3341) and officers of trust had also been
sent from the palace itself, with instructions to heighten the splendor
of the festival at the emperor’s expense.
