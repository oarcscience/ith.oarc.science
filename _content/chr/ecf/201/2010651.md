id="iv.vi.iv.lxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXV</span>.—*Lamentations of the
Soldiery and their Officers.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lxv-p2.1"></span>Immediately</span> the assembled spearmen
and body-guard rent their garments, and prostrated themselves on the
ground, striking their heads, and uttering lamentations and cries of
sorrow, calling on their imperial lord and master, or rather, like true
children, on their father, while their tribunes and centurions addressed
him as their preserver, protector, and benefactor. The rest of the
soldiery also came in respectful order to mourn as a flock the removal
of their good shepherd. The people meanwhile ran wildly throughout the
city, some expressing the inward sorrow of their hearts by loud cries,
others appearing confounded with grief: each mourning the event as a
calamity which had befallen himself, and bewailing his death as though
they felt themselves bereft of a blessing common alike to all.
