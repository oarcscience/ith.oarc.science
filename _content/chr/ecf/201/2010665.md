<span id="iv.vii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*That God is the Father
of the Word, and the Creator of all Things; and that Material Objects
could not continue to exist, were their Causes Various.*

<span id="iv.vii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.iii-p2.1"></span>God</span>, who is ever above all existence,
and the good which all things desire, has no origin, and therefore no
beginning, being himself the originator <span
id="fr_3374"></span>[3375](#fn_3374) of all things which receive
existence. But he who proceeds from him is again united to him; and this
separation from and union with him is not local, but intellectual in its
character. For this generation was accompanied by no diminution of the
Father’s substance (as in the case of generation by seed); but by the
determining act of foreknowledge God manifested a Saviour presiding
over <span id="fr_3375"></span>[3376](#fn_3375) this sensible world, and
all created things therein. <span id="fr_3376"></span>[3377](#fn_3376)
From hence, then, is the source of existence and life to all things
which are within the compass of this world; hence proceed the soul, and
every sense; <span id="fr_3377"></span>[3378](#fn_3377) hence those
organs through which the sense-perceptions are perfected. What, then, is
the object of this argument? To prove that there is One director of all
things that exist, and that all things, whether in heaven or on earth,
both natural and organized bodies, <span
id="fr_3378"></span>[3379](#fn_3378) are subject to his single
sovereignty. For if the dominion of these things, numberless as they
are, were in the hands, not of one but of many, there must be a
partition and distribution of the elements, and the old fables would be
true; <span id="fr_3379"></span>[3380](#fn_3379) jealousy, too, and
ambition, striving for superior power, would destroy the harmonious
concord of the whole, while each of the many masters would regulate in a
manner different from the rest the portion subject to his control. The
fact, however, that this universal order is ever one and the same, is
the proof that it is under the care of a superior power, and that its
origin cannot be ascribed to chance. Else how could the author of
universal nature ever be known? To whom first, or last, could prayers
and supplications be addressed? Whom could I choose <span
id="fr_3380"></span>[3381](#fn_3380) as the object of my worship,
without being guilty of impiety towards the rest? Again, if haply I
desired to obtain some temporal blessing, should I not, while expressing
my gratitude to the Power who favored my request, convey a reproach to
him who opposed it? Or to whom should I pray, when desiring to know the
cause of my calamity, and to obtain deliverance? Or let us suppose that
the answer is given by oracles and prophecies, <span id="page_563">p.
563</span> <span id="iv.vii.iii-Page_563"></span>but that the case is
not within the scope of their authority, being the province of some
other deity. <span id="fr_3381"></span>[3382](#fn_3381) Where, then, is
mercy? where is the provident care of God for the human race? Unless,
indeed, some more benevolent Power, assuming a hostile attitude against
another who has no such feeling, be disposed to accord me his
protection. Hence anger, discords, mutual censure, and finally universal
confusion, would ensue, while each departed from his proper sphere of
action, dissatisfied, through ambitious love of power, with his allotted
portion. What, then, would be the result of these things? Surely this
discord among the heavenly powers would prove destructive to the
interests of earth: the orderly alternation of times and seasons would
disappear; the successive productions of the earth would be enjoyed no
more: the day itself, and the repose of night which follows it, would
cease to be. But enough on this subject: let us once more resume that
species of reasoning which admits of no reply.

id="iv.vii.iii-p5.3"></span>. There is the greatest variety in the
rendering of this passage, of which *Bag.’s* is the worst. The writer
draws here on a philosophy of the Logos, which recognizes the second
person of the Trinity as the creator and head of created things. The
free version of Cousin gives the best flavor of the idea. “He was
produced by the inexhaustible fecundity of his eternal mind to preside
over the creation and government of this visible world.” A better
translation waits on a better exposition of the doctrine of the Logos
and its history.

him that Bacchus or Saturn must be placated in order to their
liberation.
