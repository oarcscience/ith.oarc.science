id="iv.vi.iv.l-p1.1"></span>Chapter L</span>.—*Embassy and Presents from
the Indians.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.l-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.l-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time ambassadors from the
Indians, who inhabit the distant regions of the East, arrived with
presents consisting of many varieties of brilliant precious stones, and
animals differing in species from those known to us. These offerings
they presented to the emperor, thus allowing that his sovereignty
extended even to the Indian Ocean, and that the princes of their
country, who rendered homage to him both by paintings and statues,
acknowledged his imperial and paramount authority. Thus the Eastern
Indians now submitted to his sway, as the Britons of the Western Ocean
had done at the commencement of his reign.
