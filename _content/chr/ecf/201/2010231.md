<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII.—</span>*The Peace under
Gallienus.*

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p2.1"></span>1. Shortly</span> after this Valerian was
reduced to slavery by the barbarians, <span
id="fr_2266"></span>[2267](#fn_2266) and his son having become sole
ruler, conducted the government more prudently. He immediately
restrained the persecution against us by public proclamations, <span
id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267) and directed the bishops to perform
in freedom their customary duties, in a rescript <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268) which ran as follows:

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p6"></span>2. “The Emperor Cæsar Publius Licinius
Gallienus, Pius, Felix, Augustus, <span
id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269) to Dionysius, Pinnas,
Demetrius, <span id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270) and the other
bishops. I have ordered the bounty of my gift to be declared through all
the world, that they may depart from the places of religious
worship. <span id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271) And for this purpose
you may use this copy of my rescript, that no one may molest you. And
this which you are now enabled lawfully to do, has already for a long
time been conceded by me. <span id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272)
Therefore Aurelius Cyrenius, <span id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273)
who is the chief administrator of affairs, <span
id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274) will observe this ordinance which I
have given.”

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p13"></span><span id="page_303">p. 303</span>
<span id="iii.xii.xiv-Page_303"></span>3. I have given this in a
translation from the Latin, that it may be more readily understood.
Another decree of his is extant addressed to other bishops, permitting
them to take possession again of the so-called cemeteries. <span
id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275)

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p3"></span> Valerian was taken captive by Sapor,
king of Persia, probably late in the year 260 (the date is somewhat
uncertain) and died in captivity. His son Gallienus, already associated
with him in the empire, became sole emperor when his father fell into
the Persians’ hands.

<span id="fn_2267"></span>[302:2268](2010231.htm#fr_2267) <span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p4"></span> Eusebius has not preserved the text of
these edicts (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p4.1"></span>προγρ€μματα</span>, which were public
proclamations, and thus differed from the rescripts, which were private
instructions), but the rescript to the bishops which he quotes shows
that they did more than simply put a stop to the persecution,—that they
in fact made Christianity a *religio licita,* and that for the first
time. The right of the Christians as a body (the *corpus Christianorum*)
to hold property is recognized in this rescript, and this involves the
legal recognition of that body. Moreover, the rescript is addressed to
the “bishops,” which implies a recognition of the organization of the
Church. See the article of Görres, *Die Toleranzedicte des Kaisers
Gallienus,* in the *Jahrb. für prot. Theol.,* 1877, p. 606 sq.

<span id="fn_2268"></span>[302:2269](2010231.htm#fr_2268) <span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p4.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p5.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p5.2"></span>ντιγραφή</span>: the technical term for an
epistle containing private instructions, in distinction from an edict or
public proclamation. This rescript was addressed to the bishops of the
province of Egypt (including Dionysius of Alexandria). It was evidently
issued some time after the publication of the edicts themselves. Its
exact date is uncertain, but it was probably written immediately after
the fall of the usurper Macrianus (i.e. late in 261 or early in 262),
during the time of whose usurpation the benefits of Gallienus’ edicts of
toleration could of course not have been felt in Egypt and the Orient.

<span id="fn_2270"></span>[302:2271](2010231.htm#fr_2270) <span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p7.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p8"></span> Of Pinnas and Demetrius we know
nothing. The identification of Demetrius with the presbyter mentioned in
chap. 11, §24, might be suggested as possible. There is nothing to
prevent such an identification, nor, on the other hand, is there
anything to be urged in its favor beyond mere agreement in a name which
was not an uncommon one in Egypt.

<span id="fn_2271"></span>[302:2272](2010231.htm#fr_2271) <span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p9"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p9.1"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p9.2"></span>πως ἀπὸ τῶν τόπων τῶν θρησκευσίμων
ἀποχωρήσωσι</span>. This is commonly taken to mean that the “Christians
may come forth from their religious retreats,” which, however, does not
seem to be the sense of the original. I prefer to read, with Closs,
“that the heathen may depart from the Christians’ places of worship,”
from those, namely, which they had taken possession of during the
persecution.

<span id="fn_2272"></span>[302:2273](2010231.htm#fr_2272) <span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p9.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p10"></span> The reference is doubtless to the
edicts, referred to above, which he had issued immediately after his
accession, but which had not been sooner put in force in Egypt because
of the usurper Macrianus (see above, note 3).

<span id="fn_2273"></span>[302:2274](2010231.htm#fr_2273) <span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p11"></span> So far as I am aware, this man is
known to us only from this passage.

<span id="fn_2274"></span>[302:2275](2010231.htm#fr_2274) <span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p12"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p12.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p12.2"></span>τοῦ μεγίστου πρ€γματος προστατεύων</span>.
Heinichen, following Valesius, identifies this office with the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xiv-p12.3"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xiv-p12.4"></span>ἐπὶ τῶν καθόλου
λόγων</span> (mentioned in chap. 10, §5), with the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xiv-p12.5"></span>ὁ</span> <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xiv-p12.6"></span>τῶν καθόλου λόγων
žπαρχος</span> (mentioned in Bk. IX. chap. 11, §4), &c. For the nature
of that office, see chap. 10, note 8. The phrase used in this passage
seems to suggest the identification, and yet I am inclined to think,
inasmuch as the rescript has to do specifically with the Church in
Egypt, that Aurelius Cyrenius was not (as Macrianus was under Valerian)
the emperor’s general finance minister, in charge of the affairs of the
empire, but simply the supreme finance minister or administrator of
Egypt (cf. Mommsen’s *Provinces of the Roman Empire,* Scribner’s ed.,
II. p. 268).

<span id="fn_2275"></span>[303:2276](2010231.htm#fr_2275) <span
id="iii.xii.xiv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xiv-p14"></span> The use of their cemeteries, both as
places of burial and as meeting-places for religious worship, had been
denied to the Christians by Valerian. On the origin of the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xiv-p14.1"></span>κοιμητήρια</span>, see
chap. 11, note 14.
