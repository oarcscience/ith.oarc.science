<span id="iii.x.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—</span>*The Martyrs, beloved of
God, kindly ministered unto those who fell in the Persecution.*

<span id="iii.x.iii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.iii-p2.1"></span>Such</span> things happened to the churches
of Christ under the above-mentioned emperor, <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391) from which we may reasonably
conjecture the occurrences in the other provinces. It is proper to add
other selections from the same letter, in which the moderation and
compassion of these witnesses is recorded in the following words:

<span id="iii.x.iii-p4"></span>2. “They were also so zealous in their
imitation of Christ,—‘who, being in the form of God, counted it not a
prize to be on an equality with God,’ <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392) —that, though they had attained
such honor, and had borne witness, not once or twice, but many
times,—having been brought back to prison from the wild beasts, covered
with burns and scars and wounds,—yet they did not proclaim themselves
witnesses, nor did they suffer us to address them by this name. If any
one of us, in letter or conversation, spoke of them as witnesses, they
rebuked him <span id="page_218">p. 218</span> <span
id="iii.x.iii-Page_218"></span>sharply.

<span id="iii.x.iii-p6"></span>3. For they conceded cheerfully the
appellation of Witness to Christ ‘the faithful and true Witness,’ <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393) and ‘firstborn of the dead,’ <span
id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394) and prince of the life of
God; <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395) and they reminded us of
the witnesses who had already departed, and said, ‘They are already
witnesses whom Christ has deemed worthy to be taken up in their
confession, having sealed their testimony by their departure; but we are
lowly and humble confessors.’ <span id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396)
And they besought the brethren with tears that earnest prayers should be
offered that they might be made perfect. <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397)

<span id="iii.x.iii-p12"></span>4. They showed in their deeds the power
of ‘testimony,’ manifesting great boldness toward all the brethren, and
they made plain their nobility through patience and fearlessness and
courage, but they refused the title of Witnesses as distinguishing them
from their brethren, <span id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398) being
filled with the fear of God.”

<span id="iii.x.iii-p14"></span>5. A little further on they say: “They
humbled themselves under the mighty hand, by which they are now greatly
exalted. <span id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399) They defended
all, <span id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400) but accused none. They
absolved all, but bound none. <span id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401)
And they prayed for those who had inflicted cruelties upon them, even as
Stephen, the perfect witness, ‘Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge.’ <span id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402) But if he prayed for
those who stoned him, how much more for the brethren!”

<span id="iii.x.iii-p19"></span>6. And again after mentioning other
matters, they say:

<span id="iii.x.iii-p20"></span>“For, through the genuineness of their
love, their greatest contest with him was that the Beast, being choked,
might cast out alive those whom he supposed he had swallowed. For they
did not boast over the fallen, but helped them in their need with those
things in which they themselves abounded, having the compassion of a
mother, and shedding many tears on their account before the Father.

<span id="iii.x.iii-p21"></span>7. They asked for life, and he gave it
to them, and they shared it with their neighbors. Victorious over
everything, they departed to God. Having always loved peace, and having
commended peace to us <span id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403) they
went in peace to God, leaving no sorrow to their mother, nor division or
strife to the brethren, but joy and peace and concord and love.”

<span id="iii.x.iii-p23"></span>8. This record of the affection of those
blessed ones toward the brethren that had fallen may be profitably added
on account of the inhuman and unmerciful disposition of those who, after
these events, acted unsparingly toward the members of Christ. <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404)

<span id="iii.x.iii-p16"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.iii-p16.1"></span>πᾶσι μὲν ἀπολογοῦντο</span>. Rufinus
translates *placabant omnes*; Musculus, *omnibus rationem fidei suæ
reddebant;* Valesius, *omnium defensionem suscipiebant,* though he
maintains in a note that the rendering of Musculus, or the translation
*omnibus se excusabant,* is more correct. It is true that <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.iii-p16.2"></span>πᾶσι ἀπολογοῦντο</span>
ought strictly to mean “apologized *to* all” rather than “*for* all,”
the latter being commonly expressed by the use of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.iii-p16.3"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.iii-p16.4"></span>πὲρ</span> with the
genitive (see the lexicons *s.v.* <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.iii-p16.5"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.iii-p16.6"></span>πολογέομαι</span>). At the same time, though
it may not be possible to produce any other examples of the use of the
dative, instead of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.iii-p16.7"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.iii-p16.8"></span>πὲρ</span> with the genitive, after <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.iii-p16.9"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.iii-p16.10"></span>πολογέομαι</span>, it
is clear from the context that it must be accepted in the present case.

id="iii.x.iii-p16.11"></span>

<span id="iii.x.iii-p17"></span> The question of the readmission of the
lapsed had not yet become a burning one. The conduct of the martyrs here
in absolving (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.iii-p17.1"></span>ž</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.iii-p17.2"></span>λυον</span>) those who had shown weakness
under persecution is similar to that which caused so much dispute in the
Church during and after the persecution of Decius. See below, Bk. VI.
chap. 43, note 1.

<span class="c13"><span id="iii.x.iii-p22.3"></span>mss.</span> and in
Nicephorus, and is supported by Rufinus and adopted by Stephanus,
Stroth, Burton, and Zimmermann. The majority of the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.x.iii-p22.4"></span>mss.</span>, followed by
all the other editors, including Heinichen, read <span

<span id="fn_1404"></span>[218:1405](2010143.htm#fr_1404) <span
id="iii.x.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.iii-p24"></span> Eusebius refers here to the Novatians,
who were so severe in their treatment of the lapsed, and who in his day
were spread very widely and formed an aggressive and compact
organization (see below, Bk. VI. chap. 43, note 1).
