<p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xl-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xl-p2.1"></A>By</span> this time the thirtieth year of his reign was completed. In the course of this period, his three sons had been admitted at different times as his colleagues in the empire. The first, Constantinus, who bore his father&#146;s name, obtained this distinction about the tenth year of his reign.
