iniquities were without example, and the atrocities which they dared to
perpetrate against the Church such as had never been heard of in any age
of the world, well might God himself bring before us something entirely
new, and work thereby effects such as had hitherto been never either
recorded or observed. And what miracle was ever more marvelous than the
virtues of this our emperor, whom the wisdom of God has vouchsafed as a
gift to the human race? For truly he maintained a continual testimony to
the Christ of God with all boldness, and before all men; and so far was
he from shrinking from an open profession of the Christian name, that he
rather desired to make it manifest to all that he regarded this as his
highest honor, now impressing on his face the salutary sign, and now
glorying in it as the trophy which led him on to victory. <span
