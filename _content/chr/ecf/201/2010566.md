id="iv.vi.iii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVII</span>.—*How Constantine
buried his Mother, and how he honored her during her Life.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xlvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xlvii-p2.1"></span>Her</span> body, too, was honored with
special tokens of respect, being escorted on its way to the imperial
city by a vast train of guards, and there deposited in a royal tomb.
Such were the last days of our emperor’s mother, a person worthy of
being had in perpetual remembrance, both for her own practical piety,
and because she had given birth to so extraordinary and admirable an
offspring. And well may his character be styled blessed, for his filial
piety as well as on other grounds. He rendered her through his influence
so devout a worshiper of God, (though she had not previously been such,)
that she seemed to have been instructed from the first by the Saviour of
mankind: and besides this, he had honored her so fully with imperial
dignities, that in every province, and in the very ranks of the
soldiery, she was spoken of under the titles of Augusta and empress, and
her likeness was impressed on golden coins. <span
id="fr_3280"></span>[3281](#fn_3280) He had even granted her authority
over the imperial treasures, to use and dispense them according to her
own will and discretion in every case: for this enviable distinction
also she received at the hands of her son. Hence it is that among the
qualities which shed a luster on his memory, we may rightly include that
surpassing degree of filial affection whereby he rendered full obedience
to the Divine precepts which enjoin due honor from children to their
parents. In this manner, then, the emperor executed in Palestine the
noble works I have above described: and indeed in every province he
raised new churches on a far more imposing scale than those which had
existed before his time.

(Wordsworth) that while silver and copper coins have been found with her
name, none of gold have yet come to light.
