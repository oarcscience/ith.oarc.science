Churches in Honor of Martyrs, and abolished Idolatry at Constantinople.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xlviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xlviii-p2.1"></span>And</span> being fully resolved to
distinguish the city which bore his name with especial honor, he
embellished it with numerous sacred edifices, both memorials of martyrs
on the largest scale, and other buildings of the most splendid kind, not
only within the city itself, but in its vicinity: and thus at the same
time he rendered honor to the memory of the martyrs, and consecrated his
city to the martyrs’ God. Being filled, too, with Divine wisdom, he
determined to purge the city which was to be distinguished by his own
name from idolatry of every kind, that henceforth no statues might be
worshiped there in the temples of those falsely reputed to be gods, nor
any altars defiled by the pollution of blood: that there might be no
sacrifices consumed by fire, no demon festivals, nor any of the other
ceremonies usually observed by the superstitious.
