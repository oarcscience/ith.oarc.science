<span id="iii.vi.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—</span>*The Time of his Appearance
among Men.*

<span id="iii.vi.v-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.v-p2.1"></span>And</span> now, after this necessary
introduction to our proposed history of the Church, we can enter, so to
speak, upon our journey, beginning with the appearance of our Saviour in
the flesh. And we invoke God, the Father of the Word, and him, of whom
we have been speaking, Jesus Christ himself our Saviour and Lord, the
heavenly Word of God, as our aid and fellow-laborer in the narration of
the truth.

<span id="iii.vi.v-p3"></span>2. It was in the forty-second year of the
reign of Augustus <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73) and the
twenty-eighth after the subjugation of Egypt and the death of Antony and
Cleopatra, with whom the dynasty of the Ptolemies in Egypt came to an
end, that our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem of
Judea, according to the prophecies which had been uttered concerning
him. <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74) His birth took place during
the first census, while Cyrenius was governor of Syria. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75)

<span id="iii.vi.v-p11"></span>3. Flavius Josephus, the most celebrated
of Hebrew historians, also mentions this census, <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76) which was taken during Cyrenius’ <span
id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span id="iii.vi.v-Page_89"></span>term of
office. In the same connection he gives an account of the uprising of
the Galileans, which took place at that time, of which also Luke, among
our writers, has made mention in the Acts, in the following words:
“After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and
drew away a multitude <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77) after him: he
also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were
dispersed.” <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78)

<span id="iii.vi.v-p15"></span>4. The above-mentioned author, in the
eighteenth book of his Antiquities, in agreement with these words, adds
the following, which we quote exactly: “Cyrenius, a member of the
senate, one who had held other offices and had passed through them all
to the consulship, a man also of great dignity in other respects, came
to Syria with a small retinue, being sent by Cæsar to be a judge of the
nation and to make an assessment of their property.” <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79)

<span id="iii.vi.v-p17"></span>5. And after a little <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80) he says: “But Judas, <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81) a Gaulonite, from a city called Gamala,
taking with him Sadduchus, <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82) a
Pharisee, urged the people to revolt, both of them saying that the
taxation meant nothing else than downright slavery, and exhorting the
nation to defend their liberty.”

<span id="iii.vi.v-p21"></span>6. And in the second book of his History
of the Jewish War, he writes as follows concerning the same man: “At
this time a certain Galilean, whose name was Judas, persuaded his
countrymen to revolt, declaring that they were cowards if they submitted
to pay tribute to the Romans, and if they endured, besides God, masters
who were mortal.” <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83) These things are
recorded by Josephus.

id="iii.vi.v-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.v-p4"></span> Eusebius here makes the reign of Augustus
begin with the death of Julius Cæsar (as Josephus does in chap. 9, §1,
below), and he puts the birth of Christ therefore into the year 752 U.C.
(2 <span class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.v-p4.1"></span>b.c.</span>), which
agrees with Clement of Alexandria’s *Strom.* I. (who gives the
twenty-eighth year after the conquest of Egypt as the birth-year of
Christ), with Epiphanius, *Hær.* LI. 22, and Orosius, *Hist.* I. 1.
Eusebius gives the same date also in his *Chron.* (ed. Schœne, II. p.
144). Irenæus, III. 25, and Tertullian, *Adv. Jud.* 8, on the other
hand, give the forty-first year of Augustus, 751 U.C. (3 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.v-p4.2"></span>b.c.</span>). But all these
dates are certainly too late. The true year of Christ’s birth has always
been a matter of dispute. But it must have occurred before the death of
Herod, which took place in the spring of 750 U.C. (4 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.v-p4.3"></span>b.c.</span>). The most
widely accepted opinion is that Christ was born late in the year 5, or
early in the year 4 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.v-p4.4"></span>b.c.</span>, though some scholars put the date
back as far as 7 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.v-p4.5"></span>b.c.</span>

<span id="iii.vi.v-p5"></span>The time of the year is also uncertain,
the date commonly accepted in the occident (Dec. 25th) having nothing
older than a fourth century tradition in its favor. The date accepted by
the Greek Church (Jan. 6th) rests upon a somewhat older tradition, but
neither day has any claim to reliability.

<span id="iii.vi.v-p6"></span>For a full and excellent discussion of
this subject, see the essay of Andrews in his *Life of our Lord,* pp.
1–22. See, also, Schaff’s *Church Hist.* I. p. 98 sq.

<span id="iii.vi.v-p9"></span>Quirinius is the original Latin form of
the name of which Luke gives the Greek form <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vi.v-p9.1"></span>κυρήνιος</span> or Cyrenius (which is the form
given also by Eusebius).

<span id="iii.vi.v-p10"></span>The statement of Luke presents a
chronological difficulty which has not yet been completely solved.
Quirinius we know to have been made governor of Syria in <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.v-p10.1"></span>a.d.</span> 6; and under
him occurred a census or enrollment mentioned by Josephus, *Ant.* XVII.
13. 5, and XVIII. 1. 1. This is undoubtedly the same as that referred to
in <span id="iii.vi.v-p10.2"></span>[Acts v.
37](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037)<span id="iii.vi.v-p10.3"></span>.
But this took place some ten years after the birth of Christ, and cannot
therefore be connected with that event. Many explanations have been
offered to account for the difficulty, but since the discovery of Zumpt,
the problem has been much simplified. He, as also Mommsen, has proved
that Quirinius was twice governor of Syria, the first time from <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.v-p10.4"></span>b.c.</span> 4 (autumn) to
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.vi.v-p10.5"></span>b.c.</span> 1. But as
Christ must have been born before the spring of <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vi.v-p10.6"></span>b.c.</span> 4, the governorship of Quirinius
is still a little too late. A solution of the question is thus
approached, however, though not all the difficulties are yet removed.
Upon this question, see especially A. M. Zumpt, *Das Geburtsjahr
Christi* (Leipzig, 1869), and compare Schaff’s *Church Hist.,* I.
121–125, for a condensed but excellent account of the whole matter, and
for the literature of the subject.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[88:77](2010032.htm#fr_76) <span
id="iii.vi.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.v-p12"></span> Eusebius here identifies the census
mentioned by Josephus (*Ant.* XVIII. 1. 1) and referred to in [Acts v.
37](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#037)<span id="iii.vi.v-p12.1"></span>,
with the one mentioned in <span id="iii.vi.v-p12.2"></span>[Luke ii.
2](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#002)<span id="iii.vi.v-p12.3"></span>;
but this is an obvious error, as an interval of ten years separated the
two. Valesius considers it all one census, and hence regards Eusebius as
correct in his statement; but this is very improbable. Jachmann (in
Illgen’s *Zeitschrift f. hist. Theologie,* 1839, II. p. 35 sq.),
according to his custom, charges Eusebius with willful deception and
perversion of the facts. But such a charge is utterly without warrant.
Eusebius, in cases where we can control his statements, can be shown to
have been always conscientious. Moreover, in his *Chron.* (ed. Schoene
II. p. 144) he identifies the two censuses in the same way. But his
*Chronicles* were written some years before his *History,* and he cannot
have had any object to deceive in them such as Jachmann assumes that he
had in his *History.* It is plain that Eusebius has simply made a
blunder, a thing not at all surprising when we remember how frequent his
chronological errors are. He is guilty of an inexcusable piece of
carelessness, but nothing worse. It was natural to connect the two
censuses mentioned as taking place under the same governor, though a
little closer attention to the facts would have shown him the
discrepancy in date, which he simply overlooked.

and in Josephus, *B. J.* II. 8. 1 (quoted just below), and 17.8, and in
*Ant.* XVIII. 1. 6 and XX. 5. 2, he is called Judas of Galilee. But in
the present section Josephus gives the fullest and most accurate account
of him. Gaulonitis lay east of the Jordan, opposite Galilee. Judas of
Galilee was probably his common designation, given to him either because
his revolt took rise in Galilee, or because Galilee was used as a
general term for the north country. He was evidently a man of position
and great personal influence, and drew vast numbers to his standard,
denouncing, in the name of religion, the payment of tribute to Rome and
all submission to a foreign yoke. The revolt spread very rapidly, and
the whole country was thrown into excitement and disorder; but the
Romans proved too strong for him, and he soon perished, and his
followers were dispersed, though many of them continued active until the
final destruction of the city. The influence of Judas was so great and
lasted so long that Josephus (*Ant.* XVIII. 1. 1 and 6) calls the
tendency represented by him the “fourth philosophy of the Jews,” ranking
it with Pharisaism, Sadduceeism, and Essenism. The distinguishing
characteristic of this “fourth philosophy” or sect was its love of
freedom. For an excellent account of Judas and his revolt, see Ewald’s
*Geshichte des Volkes Israel,* V. p. 16 sq.

too, must have been a man of influence and position. Later in the same
paragraph he is made by Josephus a joint founder with Judas of the
“fourth philosophy,” but in §6 of the same chapter, where the author of
it is referred to, Judas alone is mentioned.
