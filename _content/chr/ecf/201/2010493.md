id="iv.vi.ii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII</span>.—*Constantine’s
Edict to the People of the Provinces concerning the Error of Polytheism,
commencing with Some General Remarks on Virtue and Vice.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlviii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xlviii-p2.1"></span>Victor Constantinus, Maximus
Augustus</span>, to the people of the Eastern provinces.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlviii-p3"></span>“Whatever is comprehended under the
sovereign <span id="fr_3193"></span>[3194](#fn_3193) laws of nature,
seems to convey to all men an adequate idea of the forethought and
intelligence of the divine order. Nor can any, whose minds are directed
in the true path of knowledge to the attainment of that end, entertain a
doubt that the just perceptions of sound reason, as well as those of the
natural vision itself, through the sole influence of genuine virtue,
lead to the knowledge of God. Accordingly no wise man will ever be
surprised when he sees the mass of mankind influenced by opposite
sentiments. For the beauty of virtue would be useless <span
id="fr_3194"></span>[3195](#fn_3194) and unperceived, did not vice
display in contrast with it the course of perversity and folly. Hence it
is that the one is crowned with reward, while the most high God is
himself the administrator of judgment to the other.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlviii-p6"></span>“And now I will endeavor to lay
before you all as explicitly as possible, the nature of my own hopes of
future happiness. <span id="fr_3195"></span>[3196](#fn_3195)

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlviii-p5"></span> By a conjectural reading Stroth
makes this “fools,” instead of “useless,” and renders, “For fools would
not otherwise recognize the charm of virtue.”

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xlviii-p7"></span> \[The remark of Valesius in
reference to the difficulty of this chapter appears probable; viz. that
it is partly to be attributed to Constantine’s own want of clearness,
and partly to his translator, who has rendered obscure Latin into still
more obscure Greek.—*Bag.*\]
