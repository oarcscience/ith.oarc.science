<span id="iii.ix.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—</span>*The Epistle of Adrian,
decreeing that we should not be punished without a Trial*.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p2"></span>1. “<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.ix-p2.1"></span>To</span> Minucius Fundanus. I have received
an epistle, <span id="fr_1053"></span>[1054](#fn_1053) written to me by
Serennius Granianus, a most illustrious man, whom you have succeeded. It
does not seem right to me that the matter should be passed by without
examination, lest the men <span id="fr_1054"></span>[1055](#fn_1054) be
harassed and opportunity be given to the informers for practicing
villainy.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p5"></span>2. If, therefore, the inhabitants of the
province can clearly sustain this petition against the Christians so as
to give answer in a court of law, let them pursue this course alone, but
let them not have resort to men’s petitions and outcries. For it is far
more proper, if any one wishes to make an accusation, that you should
examine into it.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p6"></span>3. If any one therefore accuses them and
shows that they are doing anything contrary to the laws, do you pass
judgment according to the heinousness of the crime. <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1056](#fn_1055) But, by Hercules! if any one bring
an accusation through mere calumny, decide in regard to his
criminality, <span id="fr_1056"></span>[1057](#fn_1056) and see to it
that you inflict punishment.” <span id="fr_1057"></span>[1058](#fn_1057)

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p10"></span>Such are the contents of Adrian’s
rescript.

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p7"></span> This is the only really suspicious
sentence in the edict. That Hadrian should desire to protect his
Christian subjects as well as others from tumultuous and illegal
proceedings, and from unfounded accusations, would be of course quite
natural, and quite in accord with the spirit shown by Trajan in his
rescript. But in this one sentence he implies that the Christians are to
be condemned only for actual crimes, and that the mere profession of
Christianity is not in itself a punishable offense. Much, therefore, as
we might otherwise be tempted to accept the edict as genuine,—natural as
the style is and the position taken in the other portions of it,—this
one sentence, considered in the light of all that we know of the
attitude of Hadrian’s predecessors and successors toward the Christians,
and of all that we can gather of his own views, must, as I believe,
condemn it as a forgery.

<span id="fn_1056"></span>[182:1057](2010118.htm#fr_1056) <span
id="iii.ix.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.ix-p8"></span> Compare this sentence with the closing
words of the forged edict of Antoninus Pius quoted by Eusebius in chap.
13. Not only are the Christians to be released, but their accusers are
to be punished. Still there is a difference between the two commands in
that here only an accusation made with the purpose of slander is to be
punished, while there the accuser is to be unconditionally held as
guilty, if actual crimes are not proved against the accused Christian.
The latter command would be subversive of all justice, and brands itself
as a counterfeit on its very face; but in the present case the
injunction to enforce the law forbidding slander against those who
should slanderously accuse the Christians is not inconsistent with the
principles of Trajan and Hadrian, and hence not of itself alone an
evidence of ungenuineness.
