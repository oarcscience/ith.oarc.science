id="iv.vi.iii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVIII</span>.—*Description
of the Hemisphere, the Twelve Columns, and their Bowls.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxxviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxxviii-p2.1"></span>Opposite</span> these gates the
crowning part of the whole was the hemisphere, <span
id="fr_3269"></span>[3270](#fn_3269) which rose to the very summit of
the church. This was encircled by twelve columns (according to the
number of the apostles of our Saviour), having their capitals
embellished with silver bowls of great size, which the emperor himself
presented as a splendid offering to his God.

was of a hemispherical, or rather hemicylindrical form—*Bag.*\] Also a
much-discussed question. Compare Heinichen, vol. 3, p. 521–522.
