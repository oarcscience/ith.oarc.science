<p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxvii-p1"></A>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXVII</span>.&#8212;<i>Among Other Enactments, he decrees that no Christian shall slave to a Jew, and affirms the Validity of the Decisions of Councils.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxvii-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxvii-p2.1"></A>He</span> also passed a law to the effect that no Christian should remain in servitude to a Jewish master, on the ground that it could not be right that those whom the Saviour had ransomed should be subjected to the yoke of slavery by a people who had slain the prophets and the Lord himself. If any were found hereafter in these circumstances, the slave was to be set at liberty, and the master punished by a fine.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.vi.iv.xxvii-p3"></A>He likewise added the sanction of his authority to the decisions of bishops passed at their synods, and forbade the provincial governors to annul any of their decrees: for he rated the priests of God at a higher value than any judge whatever. These and a thousand similar provisions did he enact for the benefit of his subjects; but there is not time now to give a special description of them, such as might convey an accurate idea of his imperial wisdom in these respects: nor need I now relate at length, how, as a devoted servant of the Supreme God, he employed himself from morning until night in seeking objects for his beneficence, and how equally and universally kind he was to all.</p>
