id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*His Humane
Treatment of Prisoners.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Thus</span> the emperor and his army had
long been accustomed to act, whenever there was a prospect of an
engagement; for his God was ever present to his thoughts, and he desired
to do everything according to his will, and conscientiously to avoid any
wanton sacrifice of human life. He was anxious thus for the preservation
not only of his own subjects, but even of his enemies. Accordingly he
directed his victorious troops to spare the lives of their prisoners,
admonishing them, as human beings, not to forget the claims of their
common nature. And whenever he saw the passions of his soldiery excited
beyond control, he repressed their fury by a largess of money, rewarding
every man who saved the life of an enemy with a certain weight of gold.
And the emperor’s own sagacity led him to discover this inducement to
spare human life, so that great numbers even of the barbarians were thus
saved, and owed their lives to the emperor’s gold.
