<p class="c47"><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p1"></A>  <span class="c11"><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXXVII</span>.&#8212;<i>The Evangelists that were still Eminent at that Time.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p2"></A>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p2.1"></A>Among</span> those that were celebrated at that time was Quadratus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_928"><FONT SIZE="1">929</FONT></A>
 who, report says, was renowned along with the daughters of Philip for his prophetical gifts. And there were many others besides these who were known in those days, and who occupied the first place among the successors of the apostles. And they also, being illustrious disciples of such great men, built up the foundations of the churches which had been laid by the apostles in every place, and preached the Gospel more and more widely and scattered the saving seeds of the kingdom of heaven far and near throughout the whole world.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_929"><FONT SIZE="1">930</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p5"></A>2. For indeed most of the disciples of that time, animated by the divine word with a more ardent love for philosophy,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">931</FONT></A>
 had already fulfilled the command of the Saviour, and had distributed their goods to the needy.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_931"><FONT SIZE="1">932</FONT></A>
 Then starting out upon long journeys they performed the office of evangelists, being filled with the desire to preach Christ to those who had not yet heard the word of faith, and to deliver to them the divine Gospels.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p8"></A>3. And when they had only laid the foundations of the faith in foreign places, they appointed others as pastors, and entrusted them with the nurture of those that had recently been brought in, while they themselves went on again to other countries and nations, with the grace and the co-operation of God. For a great many wonderful works were done through them by the power of the divine Spirit, so that at the first hearing whole multitudes of men eagerly embraced the religion of the Creator of the universe.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p9"></A>4. But since it is impossible for us to enumerate the names of all that became shepherds or evangelists in the churches throughout the world in the age immediately succeeding the apostles, we have recorded, as was fitting, the names of those only who have transmitted the apostolic doctrine to us in writings still extant.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p3"></A> This Quadratus had considerable reputation as a prophet, as may be gathered from Eusebius&#146; mention of him here, and also from the reference to him in the anonymous work against the Montanists (see below, Bk. V. chap. 16). We know nothing about this Quadratus except what is told us in these two passages, unless we identify him, as many do, with Quadratus the apologist mentioned below, in Bk. IV. chap. 3. This identification is possible, but by no means certain. See Bk. IV. chap. 3, note 2.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p4"></A> This rhetorical flourish arouses the suspicion that Eusebius, although he says there were &#8220;many others&#8221; that were well known in those days, was unacquainted with the names of such persons as we, too, are unacquainted with them. None will deny that there may have been some men of prominence in the Church at this time, but Eusebius apparently had no more information to impart in regard to them than he gives us in this chapter, and he makes up for his lack of facts in a way which is not at all uncommon.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p6"></A> That is, an ascetic mode of life. See Bk. VI. chap. 3, note 9.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p7"></A> See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#021">Matt. xix. 21</a><a name="iii.viii.xxxvii-p7.1"></A>. Eusebius agrees with nearly all the Fathers, and with the Roman Catholic Church of the past and present, in his misinterpretation of this advice given by Christ to the rich young man.</p>
