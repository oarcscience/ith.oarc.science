<span id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*That after the
Abdication of Diocletian and Maximian, Constantius became Chief
Augustus, and was blessed with a Numerous Offspring.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> immediate consequence of this
conduct was a recompense from the hand of God, insomuch that he came
into the supreme authority of the empire. For the older emperors, for
some unknown reason, resigned their power; and this sudden change took
place in the first year after their persecution of the churches. <span
id="fr_3085"></span>[3086](#fn_3085)

<span id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p4"></span>From that time Constantius alone
received the honors of chief Augustus, having been previously, indeed,
distinguished by the diadem of the imperial Cæsars, <span
id="fr_3086"></span>[3087](#fn_3086) among whom he held the first rank;
but after his worth had been proved in this capacity, he was invested
with the highest dignity of the Roman empire, being named chief Augustus
of the four who were afterwards elected to that honor. Moreover, he
surpassed most of the emperors in regard to the number of his family,
having gathered around him a very large circle of children both male and
female. And, lastly, when he had attained to a happy old age, and was
about to pay the common debt of nature, and exchange this life for
another, God once more manifested His power in a special manner on his
behalf, by providing that his eldest son Constantine should be present
during his last moments, and ready to receive the imperial power from
his hands. <span id="fr_3087"></span>[3088](#fn_3087)

<span id="fn_3085"></span>[487:3086](2010403.htm#fr_3085) <span
id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p3"></span> The persecution was in 303 or 304.
Compare discussion of date in Clinton, *Fasti Rom.* ann. 303–305. The
abdication was in 305.

<span id="fn_3086"></span>[487:3087](2010403.htm#fr_3086) <span
id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p5"></span> Eusebius uses the terms Augustus,
king, autocrat, and Cæsar with a good deal of interchangeableness. It is
hard to tell sometimes whether king (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p5.1"></span>βασιλεύς</span>) means emperor or Cæsar.
In general, Augustus has been transferred in translations, and king and
autocrat both rendered emperor, which seems to be his real usage.

<span id="fn_3087"></span>[487:3088](2010403.htm#fr_3087) <span
id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vi.i.xviii-p6"></span> Constantine reached him just before
his death, though possibly some weeks before. Compare Prolegomena.
