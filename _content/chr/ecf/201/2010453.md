selected to carry the Cross.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>Accordingly</span>, he selected those of
his bodyguard who were most distinguished for personal strength, valor,
and piety, and entrusted them with the sole care and defense of the
standard. There were thus no less than fifty men whose only duty was to
surround and vigilantly defend the standard, which they carried each in
turn on their shoulders. These circumstances were related to the writer
of this narrative by the emperor himself in his leisure moments, long
after the occurrence of the events: and he added another incident well
worthy of being recorded.
