<span id="iv.iii.v.i-p4"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.iii.v.i-p4.1"></span>The</span> insertion in such a work as this
of what seems almost technical in its character has this twofold
purpose: first, to give a glimpse of the grounds of our knowledge of
Constantine, with a view of how far and in what directions it has been
worked out through literature; second, to serve the expressed purpose of
this series, of encouraging farther study in its lines. The very
knowledge of what the sources are, and their character, apart from any
special study of them, gives a width of horizon and definiteness of
conception to the general student, which can hardly be gotten in any
other way; while for any one who plans farther study in any line, it is
of first importance to find the what and where of his material.
