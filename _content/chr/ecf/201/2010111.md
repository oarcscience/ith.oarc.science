<span id="iii.ix.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—</span>*The Calamities of the
Jews during Trajan’s Reign.*

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> teaching and the Church of our
Saviour flourished greatly and made progress from day to day; but the
calamities of the Jews increased, and they underwent a constant
succession of evils. In the eighteenth year of Trajan’s reign <span
id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972) there was another disturbance of the
Jews, through which a great multitude of them perished. <span
id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973)

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p5"></span>2. For in Alexandria and in the rest of
Egypt, and also in Cyrene, <span id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974) as if
incited by some terrible and factious spirit, they rushed into seditious
measures against their fellow-inhabitants, the Greeks. The insurrection
increased greatly, and in the following year, while Lupus was governor
of all Egypt, <span id="fr_975"></span>[976](#fn_975) it developed into
a war of no mean magnitude.

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p8"></span>3. In the first attack it happened that
they were victorious over the Greeks, who fled to Alexandria and
imprisoned and slew the Jews that were in the city. But the Jews of
Cyrene, although deprived of their aid, continued to plunder the land of
Egypt and to devastate its districts, <span
id="fr_976"></span>[977](#fn_976) under the leadership of Lucuas. <span
id="fr_977"></span>[978](#fn_977) Against them the emperor sent Marcius
Turbo <span id="fr_978"></span>[979](#fn_978) with a foot and naval
force and also with a force of cavalry.

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p12"></span>4. He carried on the war against them
for a <span id="page_175">p. 175</span> <span
id="iii.ix.ii-Page_175"></span>long time and fought many battles, and
slew many thousands of Jews, not only of those of Cyrene, but also of
those who dwelt in Egypt and had come to the assistance of their king
Lucuas.

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p13"></span>5. But the emperor, fearing that the
Jews in Mesopotamia would also make an attack upon the inhabitants of
that country, commanded Lucius Quintus <span
id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979) to clear the province of them. And he
having marched against them slew a great multitude of those that dwelt
there; and in consequence of his success he was made governor of Judea
by the emperor. These events are recorded also in these very words by
the Greek historians that have written accounts of those times. <span

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p4"></span> Closs says: “According to Dion Cassius,
LXVIII. 32, they slew in Cyrene 220,000 persons with terrible cruelty.
At the same time there arose in Cyprus a disturbance of the Jews, who
were very numerous in that island. According to Dion, 240,000 of the
inhabitants were slain there. Their leader was Artemion.” Compare Dion
Cassius, *Hist. Rom*. LXVIII. 32, and LXIX. 12 sq. The Jews and the
Greeks that dwelt together in different cities were constantly getting
into trouble. The Greeks scorned the Jews, and the Jews in return hated
the Greeks and stirred up many bloody commotions against them. See
Jost’s *Geschichte der Israeliten*, chap. III. p. 181 sq. The word
“another” in this passage is used apparently with reference to the
Jewish war under Vespasian, of which Eusebius has spoken at length in
the early part of the third Book.

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p6"></span> The Jews were very numerous both in
Egypt and in Cyrene, which lay directly west of Egypt. The Jews of
Cyrene had a synagogue at Jerusalem, according to [Acts vi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#009)<span id="iii.ix.ii-p6.1"></span>.

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p7"></span> Lupus is, to me at least, an otherwise
unknown character.

id="iii.ix.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p10"></span> Lucuas is called by Dion Cassius
(LXVIII. 32) Andreas. Münter suggests that he may have borne a double
name, a Jewish and a Roman, as did many of the Jews of that time.

<span id="fn_978"></span>[174:979](2010111.htm#fr_978) <span
id="iii.ix.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p11"></span> Marcius Turbo was one of the most
distinguished of the Roman generals under Trajan and Hadrian, and
finally became prætorian prefect under Hadrian. See Dion Cassius, LXIX.
18, and Spartian, *Hadr*. 4–9, 15.

<span id="fn_979"></span>[175:980](2010111.htm#fr_979) <span
id="iii.ix.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p14"></span> Lucius Quintus was an independent
Moorish chief, who served voluntarily in the Roman army and became one
of Trajan’s favorite generals. He was made governor of Judea by Trajan,
and was afterward raised to the consulship. According to Themistius
(*Orat*. XVI.), Trajan at one time intended to make him his successor.
See Dion Cassius, LXVIII. 8, 22, 30, 32; LXIX. 2; Spartian, *Hadr*. 5,
7, and cf. Valesius’ note on this passage.

<span id="fn_980"></span>[175:981](2010111.htm#fr_980) <span
id="iii.ix.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.ii-p15"></span> The language of Eusebius might imply
that he had other sources than the Greek writers, but this does not seem
to have been the case. He apparently followed Dion Cassius for the most
part, but evidently had some other source (the same which Orosius
afterward followed), for he differs from Dion in the name of the Jewish
leader, calling him Lucuas instead of Andreas. The only extant accounts
of these affairs by Greek historians are those of Dion Cassius and
Orosius, but there were evidently others in Eusebius’ time.
