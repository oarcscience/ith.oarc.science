<span id="iii.xi.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—</span>*The Miracles of
Narcissus.*

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> citizens of that parish mention
many other miracles of Narcissus, on the tradition of the brethren who
succeeded him; among which they relate the following wonder as performed
by him.

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p3"></span>2. They say that the oil once failed
while the deacons were watching through the night at the great paschal
vigil. Thereupon the whole multitude being dismayed, Narcissus directed
those who attended to the lights, to draw water and bring it to him.

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p4"></span>3. This being immediately done he prayed
over the water, and with firm faith in the Lord, commanded them to pour
it into the lamps. And when they had done so, contrary to all
expectation by a wonderful and divine power, the nature of the water was
changed into that of oil. A small portion of it has been preserved even
to our day by many of the brethren there as a memento of the
wonder. <span id="fr_1815"></span>[1816](#fn_1815)

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p6"></span>4. They tell many other things worthy to
be noted of the life of this man, among which is this. Certain base men
being unable to endure the strength and firmness of his life, and
fearing punishment for the many evil deeds of which they were conscious,
sought by plotting to anticipate him, and circulated a terrible slander
against him.

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p7"></span>5. And to persuade those who heard of it,
they confirmed their accusations with oaths: one invoked upon himself
destruction by fire; another the wasting of his body by a foul disease;
the third the loss of <span id="page_256">p. 256</span> <span
id="iii.xi.ix-Page_256"></span>his eyes. But though they swore in this
manner, they could not affect the mind of the believers; because the
continence and virtuous life of Narcissus were well known to all.

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p8"></span>6. But he could not in any wise endure
the wickedness of these men; and as he had followed a philosophic <span
id="fr_1816"></span>[1817](#fn_1816) life for a long time, he fled from
the whole body of the Church, and hid himself in desert and secret
places, and remained there many years. <span
id="fr_1817"></span>[1818](#fn_1817)

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p11"></span>7. But the great eye of judgment was not
unmoved by these things, but soon looked down upon these impious men,
and brought on them the curses with which they had bound themselves. The
residence of the first, from nothing but a little spark falling upon it,
was entirely consumed by night, and he perished with all his family. The
second was speedily covered with the disease which he had imprecated
upon himself, from the sole of his feet to his head.

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p12"></span>8. But the third, perceiving what had
happened to the others, and fearing the inevitable judgment of God, the
ruler of all, confessed publicly what they had plotted together. And in
his repentance he became so wasted by his great lamentations, and
continued weeping to such an extent, that both his eyes were destroyed.
Such were the punishments which these men received for their falsehood.

<span id="iii.xi.ix-p5"></span> This miracle is related by Eusebius upon
the testimony, not of documents, but of those who had shown him the oil,
which was preserved in Jerusalem down to that time; <span

evidently not taught him to disbelieve every wonderful tale that was
told him.
