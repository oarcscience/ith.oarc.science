<span id="iv.vii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*The Coming of Christ
was predicted by the Prophets; and was ordained to be the Overthrow of
Idols and Idolatrous Cities.*

<span id="iv.vii.xvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xvi-p2.1"></span>Long</span> since had his passion, as well
as his advent in the flesh, been predicted by the prophets. The time,
too, of his incarnation had been foretold, and the manner in which the
fruits of iniquity and profligacy, so ruinous to the works and ways of
righteousness, should be destroyed, and the whole world partake of the
virtues of wisdom and sound discretion, through the almost universal
prevalence of those principles of conduct which the Saviour should
promulgate, over the minds of men; whereby the worship of God should be
confirmed, and the rites of superstition utterly abolished. By these not
the slaughter of animals alone, but the sacrifice of human victims, and
the pollutions of an accursed worship, had been devised: as, for
example, by the laws of Assyria and Egypt, the lives of innocent men
were offered up in images of brass or earth. Therefore have these
nations received a recompense worthy so foul a worship. Memphis and
Babylon \[it was declared\] <span id="fr_3445"></span>[3446](#fn_3445)
shall be wasted, and left desolate with their fathers’ gods. Now these
things I speak not from the report of others, but having myself been
present, and actually seen the most wretched of these cities, the
unfortunate Memphis. <span id="fr_3446"></span>[3447](#fn_3446) Moses
desolated, at the Divine command, the land of the once mighty Pharaoh,
whose arrogance was his destruction, <span
id="fr_3447"></span>[3448](#fn_3447) and destroyed his army (which had
proved victorious over numerous and mighty nations, an army strong in
defenses and in arms), not by the flight of arrows or the hurling of
hostile weapons, but by holy prayer alone, and quiet supplication.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3445"></span>[573:3446](2010678.htm#fr_3445) <span
id="iv.vii.xvi-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xvi-p3"></span> Not in text. This parenthesis is the
least obnoxious of various proposed paraphrases.

<span id="fn_3446"></span>[573:3447](2010678.htm#fr_3446) <span
id="iv.vii.xvi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xvi-p4"></span> Probably refers to its destruction by
Diocletian, whom Constantine accompanied. See Prolegomena, *Life, Early
Years.*

<span id="fn_3447"></span>[573:3448](2010678.htm#fr_3447) <span
id="iv.vii.xvi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xvi-p5"></span> The text of this passage is most
dubious. *Bag.,* following Valesius, translates: “And an actual witness
of the wretched fate which has befallen these cities. Memphis lies
desolate; that city which was the pride of the once mighty Pharaoh whose
power Moses crushed at the Divine command.” This has been changed to
accord with the text and punctuation of Heinichen. The change makes
Constantine declare himself an eye-witness of the fate of Memphis alone,
which is thought to accord with the facts; for while he was in fact in
Egypt with Diocletian there is no evidence that he ever saw Babylon. And
yet it is possible he did.
