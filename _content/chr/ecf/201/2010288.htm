<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xv.iii-p3"></A> Jupiter Philius, the god of friendship or good-will, was widely honored in the East. He seems to have been the tutelary divinity of Antioch, and, according to Valesius, a temple of his at Antioch is mentioned by the emperor Julian and by Libanius.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xv.iii-p4"></A> &#8220;The ceremonies of the Gentiles, used in the erection and consecration of images to their gods, were various. Jupiter Ctesius was consecrated with one sort of rites, Herceus with another, and Philius with a third sort&#8221; (Valesius). For farther particulars, see his note <i>ad locum.</i></p>
