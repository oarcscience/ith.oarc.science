Part of the Taxes.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> extent to which he studied the
general happiness and prosperity may be understood from a single
instance most beneficial and universal in its application, and still
gratefully remembered. He remitted a fourth part of the yearly tribute
paid for land, and bestowed it on the owners of the soil; so that if we
compute this yearly reduction, we shall find that the cultivators
enjoyed their produce free of tribute every fourth year. <span

law, and secured for the time to come, has given occasion for the
emperor’s beneficence to be held, not merely by the then present
generation, but by their children and descendants, in perpetual
remembrance.
