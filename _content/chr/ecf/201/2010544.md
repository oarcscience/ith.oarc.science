id="iv.vi.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*How he ordered the
Erection of a Church at Jerusalem, in the Holy Place of our Saviour’s
Resurrection.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxv-p2.1"></span>After</span> these things, the pious
emperor addressed himself to another work truly worthy of record, in the
province of Palestine. What <span id="page_527">p. 527</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxv-Page_527"></span>then was this work? He judged it
incumbent on him to render the blessed locality of our Saviour’s
resurrection an object of attraction and veneration to all. He issued
immediate injunctions, therefore, for the erection in that spot of a
house of prayer: and this he did, not on the mere natural impulse of his
own mind, but being moved in spirit by the Saviour himself.
