<span id="iii.vii.i-p3"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.i-p3.1"></span>We</span> have discussed in the preceding
book those subjects in ecclesiastical history which it was necessary to
treat by way of introduction, and have accompanied them with brief
proofs. Such were the divinity of the saving Word, and the antiquity of
the doctrines which we teach, as well as of that evangelical life which
is led by Christians, together with the events which have taken place in
connection with Christ’s recent appearance, and in connection with his
passion and with the choice of the apostles.

<span id="iii.vii.i-p4"></span>2. In the present book let us examine the
events which took place after his ascension, confirming some of them
from the divine Scriptures, and others from such writings as we shall
refer to from time to time.
