<span id="iv.vi.i.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Of his Christian
Manner of Life.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xvii-p2.1"></span>The</span> father of Constantine, then, is
said to have possessed such a character as we have briefly described.
And what kind of death was vouchsafed to him in consequence of such
devotion to God, and how far he whom he honored made his lot to differ
from that of his colleagues in the empire, may be known to any one who
will give his attention to the circumstances of the case. For after he
had for a long time given many proofs of royal virtue, in acknowledging
the Supreme God alone, and condemning the polytheism of the ungodly, and
had fortified his household by the prayers of holy men, <span
id="fr_3083"></span>[3084](#fn_3083) he passed the remainder of his life
in remarkable repose and tranquillity, in the enjoyment of what is
counted blessedness,—neither molesting others nor being molested
ourselves.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xvii-p4"></span>Accordingly, during the whole course
of his quiet and peaceful reign, he dedicated his entire household, his
children, his wife, and domestic attendants, to the One Supreme God: so
that the company assembled within the walls of his palace differed in no
respect from a church of God; wherein were also to be found his
ministers, who offered continual supplications on behalf of their
prince, and this at a time when, with most, <span
id="fr_3084"></span>[3085](#fn_3084) it was not allowable to have any
dealings with the worshipers of God, even so far as to exchange a word
with them.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xvii-p3"></span> “Is said to have” is added
conjecturally here by an earlier editor, but Heinichen omits, as it
would seem Eusebius himself did.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xvii-p5"></span> Other readings are “with the others,”
or “with the rest,” but in whatever reading it refers to all the other
emperors.
