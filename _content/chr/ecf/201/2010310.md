<span id="iii.xvii.iii"></span>

<span id="iii.xvii.iii-p1"></span> On Bk. III. chap. 24, § 17 (note 18
continued).

<span id="iii.xvii.iii-p2"></span>In three places in the *Church
History* (Bk. III. chap. 24, § 17, chap. 25, § 2, and chap. 39, § 16)
John’s “former” epistle is referred to, as if he had written only two.
In the last passage the use of <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iii-p2.1"></span>προτέρα</span> instead of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iii-p2.2"></span>πρώτη</span> might be
explained as Westcott suggests (*Canon of the New Testament*, p. 77,
note 2), by supposing Eusebius to be reproducing the words of Papias;
but in the other passages this explanation will not do, for the words
are certainly Eusebius’ own. In the Muratorian Canon only two epistles
of John are mentioned, and in Irenæus the second epistle is quoted as if
it were the first (see Westcott, *ibid*. p. 384, note 1). These facts
lead Westcott to ask: “Is it possible that the second epistle was looked
upon as an appendix to the first? and may we thus explain the references
to *two* epistles of John?” He continues: “The first epistle, as is well
known, was called *ad Parthos* by Augustine and some other Latin
authorities; and the same title <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iii-p2.3"></span>πρὸς Π€ρθους</span> is given to the second
epistle in one Greek manuscript (62 Scholz). The Latin translation of
Clement’s *Outlines* (IV. 66) says: *Secunda Johannis epistola quæ ad
virgines* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iii-p2.4"></span>παρθένους</span>) *scripta simplissima
est*. Jerome, it may be added, quotes names from the *third* epistle as
from the *second* (*De nom. Hebr*.).” On the other hand, in Bk. V. chap.
8, § 7, Eusebius speaks of the “first” (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xvii.iii-p2.5"></span>πρώτη</span>) epistle of John, and in Bk.
III. chap. 25, § 3, he expressly mentions a second and third epistle of
John. It is evident, therefore, that whatever the use of <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iii-p2.6"></span>προτέρα</span> instead
of <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iii-p2.7"></span>πρώτη</span>
in connection with John’s first epistle may mean as used by others, it
does not indicate a knowledge of only a first and second as used by him.
It is by no means impossible, however, that Westcott’s suggestion may be
correct, and that the first and second epistles were sometimes looked
upon as but one, and it is possible that such use of them by some of his
predecessors may account for Eusebius’ employment of the word <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.iii-p2.8"></span>προτέρα</span> in
three separate passages.
