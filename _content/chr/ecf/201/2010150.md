<span id="iii.x.x-p5"></span> Of this Julian we know nothing except what
is told us by Eusebius here and in chap. 22, below, where he is said to
have held office ten years. In the *Chron.* he is also said to have been
bishop for ten years, but his accession is put in the nineteenth year of
Marcus Aurelius (by Jerome), or in the second year of Commodus (by the
Armenian version).
