id="iii.x.vii-Page_221"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—</span>*Catalogue of the Bishops
of Rome.*

<span id="iii.x.vii-p2"></span>1. “<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.vii-p2.1"></span>The</span> blessed apostles <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437) having founded and established the
church, entrusted the office of the episcopate to Linus. <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438) Paul speaks of this Linus in his
Epistles to Timothy. <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439)

<span id="iii.x.vii-p6"></span>2. Anencletus <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440) succeeded him, and after
Anencletus, in the third place from the apostles, Clement <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1442](#fn_1441) received the episcopate. He had
seen and conversed with the blessed apostles, <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1443](#fn_1442) and their preaching was still
sounding in his ears, and their tradition was still before his eyes. Nor
was he alone in this, for many who had been taught by the apostles yet
survived.

<span id="iii.x.vii-p10"></span>3. In the times of Clement, a serious
dissension having arisen among the brethren in Corinth, <span
id="fr_1443"></span>[1444](#fn_1443) the church of Rome sent a most
suitable letter to the Corinthians, <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444) reconciling them in peace, renewing
their faith, and proclaiming <span id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445)
the doctrine lately received from the apostles.” <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446)

<span id="iii.x.vii-p15"></span>4. A little farther on he says: <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447)

<span id="iii.x.vii-p17"></span>“Evarestus <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448) succeeded Clement, and
Alexander, <span id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449) Evarestus. Then
Xystus, <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450) the sixth from the
apostles, was appointed. After him Telesphorus, <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451) who suffered martyrdom gloriously;
then Hyginus; <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452) then
Pius; <span id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453) and after him
Anicetus; <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454) Soter <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455) succeeded Anicetus; and now, in the
twelfth place from the apostles, Eleutherus <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456) holds the office of bishop.

<span id="iii.x.vii-p27"></span>5. In the same order and
succession <span id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457) the tradition in
the Church and the preaching of the truth has descended from the
apostles unto us.”

id="iii.x.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vii-p9"></span> Although the identification of this
Clement with the one mentioned in [Philip.
4.3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003)<span id="iii.x.vii-p9.1"></span>
is more than doubtful, yet there is no reason to doubt that, living as
he did in the first century at Rome, he was personally acquainted at
least with the apostles Peter and Paul.

<span id="fn_1443"></span>[221:1444](2010147.htm#fr_1443) <span
id="iii.x.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vii-p11"></span> See the Epistle of Clement itself,
especially chaps. 1 and 3.

<span id="fn_1444"></span>[221:1445](2010147.htm#fr_1444) <span
id="iii.x.vii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vii-p12"></span> Upon the epistle, see above, Bk. III.
chap. 16, note 1.

<span id="fn_1445"></span>[221:1446](2010147.htm#fr_1445) <span
id="iii.x.vii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vii-p13"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vii-p13.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vii-p13.2"></span>νεοῦσα τὴν πίστιν αὐτῶν καὶ ἣν νεωστὶ ἀπὸ
τῶν ἀποστόλων παρ€δοσιν εἰλήφει</span>. The last word being in the
singular, the tradition must be that received by the Roman, not by the
Corinthian church (as it is commonly understood), and hence it is
necessary to supply some verb which shall govern <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.vii-p13.3"></span>παρ€δοσιν</span>, for it
is at least very harsh to say that the Roman church, in its epistle to
the Corinthians “renewed” the faith which *it* had received. The truth
is, that both in Rufinus and in Irenæus an extra participle is found (in
the former *exprimens,* in the latter *annuntians*), and Stroth has in
consequence ventured to insert the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vii-p13.4"></span>καταγγέλουσα</span> in his text. I have
likewise, for the sake of the sense, inserted the word *proclaiming,*
not thereby intending to imply, however, the belief that <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.vii-p13.5"></span>καταγγέλουσα</span>
stood in the original text of Eusebius.

<span id="fn_1446"></span>[221:1447](2010147.htm#fr_1446) <span
id="iii.x.vii-p13.6"></span>

<span id="iii.x.vii-p14"></span> It is interesting to notice how
strictly Eusebius carries out his principle of taking historical matter
wherever he can find it, but of omitting all doctrinal statements and
discussions. The few sentences which follow in Irenæus are of a
doctrinal nature, and in the form of a brief polemic against Gnosticism.

<span id="iii.x.vii-p28"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vii-p28.1"></span>διαδοχῇ</span>, which is confirmed by the
ancient Latin version of Irenæus *(successione),* and which is adopted
by Zimmermann, Heinichen, and Valesius (in his notes). All the <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.x.vii-p28.2"></span>mss.</span> of Eusebius,
followed by the majority of the editors, read <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.vii-p28.3"></span>διδαχῇ</span>, which, however, makes no
sense in this place, and can hardly have been the original reading (see
Heinichen’s note *in loco*).
