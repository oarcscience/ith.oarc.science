<span id="iv.vi.iv.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*He enjoins the
General Observance of the Lord’s Day, and the Day of Preparation.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xviii-p2.1"></span>He</span> ordained, too, that one day
should be regarded as a special occasion for prayer: I mean that which
is truly the first and chief of all, the day of our Lord and Saviour.
The entire care of his household was entrusted to deacons and other
ministers consecrated to the service of God, and distinguished by
gravity of life and every other virtue: while his trusty body guard,
strong in affection and fidelity to his person, found in their emperor
an instructor in the practice of piety, and like him held the Lord’s
salutary day in honor and performed on that day the devotions which he
loved. The same observance was recommended by this blessed prince to all
classes of his subjects: his earnest desire being gradually to lead all
mankind to the worship of God. Accordingly he enjoined on all the
subjects of the Roman empire to observe the Lord’s day, as a day of
rest, and also to honor the day which precedes the Sabbath; in memory, I
suppose, of what the Saviour of mankind is recorded to have achieved on
that day. <span id="fr_3317"></span>[3318](#fn_3317) And since his
desire was to teach his whole army zealously to honor the Saviour’s day
(which derives its name from light, and from the sun), <span
id="fr_3318"></span>[3319](#fn_3318) he freely granted to those <span
id="page_545">p. 545</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iv.xviii-Page_545"></span>among them who were partakers of the
divine faith, leisure for attendance on the services of the Church of
God, in order that they might be able, without impediment, to perform
their religious worship.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xviii-p3"></span> \[That is, Friday. The passage is
not very intelligible. Does it mean that Constantine ordered this day to
be distinguished in some way from others, as the day of the Lord’s
crucifixion?—*Bag.*\]

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xviii-p4"></span> \[The decree of Constantine for the
general observance of Sunday appears to have been issued <span
class="c13"><span id="iv.vi.iv.xviii-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span> 321,
before which time both “the old and new sabbath” were observed by
Christians.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xviii-p5"></span>“Constantine (says Gibbon, ch. 20,
note 8) styles the Lord’s day *Dies solis,* a name which could not
offend the ears of his Pagan subjects.”—*Bag*.\] This has been urged as
ground for saying that Constantine did not commit himself to
Christianity until the end of life, but it only shows his tact and care
in treating the diverse elements of his empire.
