<span id="iii.viii.iv-Page_136"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV.—</span>*The First Successors of
the Apostles.*

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.iv-p2.1"></span>That</span> Paul preached to the Gentiles
and laid the foundations of the churches “from Jerusalem round about
even unto Illyricum,” is evident both from his own words, <span
id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600) and from the account which Luke has
given in the Acts. <span id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601)

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p5"></span>2. And in how many provinces Peter
preached Christ and taught the doctrine of the new covenant to those of
the circumcision is clear from his own words in his epistle already
mentioned as undisputed, <span id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602) in
which he writes to the Hebrews of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia,
Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. <span id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603)

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p8"></span>3. But the number and the names of
those among them that became true and zealous followers of the apostles,
and were judged worthy to tend the churches founded by them, it is not
easy to tell, except those mentioned in the writings of Paul.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p9"></span>4. For he had innumerable
fellow-laborers, or “fellow-soldiers,” as he called them, <span
id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604) and most of them were honored by him
with an imperishable memorial, for he gave enduring testimony concerning
them in his own epistles.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p11"></span>5. Luke also in the Acts speaks of his
friends, and mentions them by name. <span
id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605)

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p13"></span>6. Timothy, so it is recorded, was the
first to receive the episcopate of the parish in Ephesus, <span
id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606) Titus of the churches in Crete. <span
id="fr_607"></span>[608](#fn_607)

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p16"></span>7. But Luke, <span
id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608) who was of Antiochian parentage and a
physician by profession, <span id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609) and who
was especially intimate with Paul and well acquainted with the rest of
the apostles, <span id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610) has left us, in
two inspired books, proofs of that spiritual healing art which he
learned from them. One of these books is the Gospel, <span
id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611) which he testifies that he wrote as
those who were from the beginning eye witnesses and ministers of the
word delivered unto him, all of whom, as he says, he followed accurately
from the first. <span id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612) The other book
is the Acts of the Apostles <span id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613)
which he <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> <span
id="iii.viii.iv-Page_137"></span>composed not from the accounts of
others, but from what he had seen himself.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p23"></span>8. And they say that Paul meant to
refer to Luke’s Gospel wherever, as if speaking of some gospel of his
own, he used the words, “according to my Gospel.” <span
id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614)

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p25"></span>9. As to the rest of his followers,
Paul testifies that Crescens was sent to Gaul; <span
id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615) but Linus, whom he mentions in the
Second Epistle to Timothy <span id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616) as his
companion at Rome, was Peter’s successor in the episcopate of the church
there, as has already been shown. <span
id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617)

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p29"></span>10. Clement also, who was appointed
third bishop of the church at Rome, was, as Paul testifies, his
co-laborer and fellow-soldier. <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618)

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p31"></span>11. Besides these, that Areopagite,
named Dionysius, who was the first to believe after Paul’s address to
the Athenians in the Areopagus (as recorded by Luke in the Acts) <span
id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619) is mentioned by another Dionysius, an
<span id="page_138">p. 138</span> <span
id="iii.viii.iv-Page_138"></span>ancient writer and pastor of the parish
in Corinth, <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620) as the first bishop
of the church at Athens.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p36"></span>12. But the events connected with the
apostolic succession we shall relate at the proper time. Meanwhile let
us continue the course of our history.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p14"></span> That Timothy was the first bishop of
Ephesus is stated also by the *Apost. Const.* (VII. 46), and by
Nicephorus (*H. E.* III. 11), who records (upon what authority we do not
know) that he suffered martyrdom under Domitian. Against the tradition
that he labored during his later years in Ephesus there is nothing to be
urged; though on the other hand the evidence for it amounts to little,
as it seems to be no more than a conclusion drawn from the Epistles to
Timothy, though hardly a conclusion drawn by Eusebius himself, for he
uses the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.iv-p14.1"></span>ἱ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.iv-p14.2"></span>στορεῖται</span>, which seems to imply
that he had some authority for his statement. According to those
epistles, he was at the time of their composition in Ephesus, though
they give us no hint as to whether he was afterward there or not. From
[Heb. xiii. 23](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#023)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p14.3"></span> (the date of which we do not know) we
learn that he had just been released from some imprisonment, apparently
in Italy, but whither he afterward went is quite uncertain. Eusebius’
report that he was bishop of Ephesus is the customary but unwarranted
carrying back into the first century of the monarchical episcopate which
was not known until the second. According to the *Apost. Const.* VII. 46
both Timothy and John were bishops of Ephesus, the former appointed by
Paul, the latter by himself. Timothy is a saint in the Roman Catholic
sense, and is commemorated January 24.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[136:608](2010073.htm#fr_607) <span
id="iii.viii.iv-p14.4"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p15"></span> Cf. [Tit. i.
5](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#005)<span id="iii.viii.iv-p15.1"></span>.
Titus is commonly connected by tradition with Crete, of which he is
supposed to have been the first bishop,—the later institution being
again pushed back into the first century. In the fragment *de Vita et
Actis Titi,* by the lawyer Zenas (in Fabric. *Cod. Apoc. N.T.* II. 831
sqq., according to Howson, in Smith’s *Dict. of the Bible*), he is said
to have been bishop of Gortyna, a city of Crete (where still stand the
ruins of a church which bears his name), and of a royal Cretan family by
birth. This tradition is late, and, of course, of little authority, but
at the same time, accords very well with all that we know of Titus; and
consequently there is no reason for denying it *in toto.* According to
<span id="iii.viii.iv-p15.2"></span>[2 Tim. iv.
10](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#010)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p15.3"></span>, he went, or was sent, into Dalmatia; but
universal tradition ascribes his later life and his death to Crete.
Candia, the modern capital, claims the honor of being his burial place
(see Cave’s*Apostolici,* ed. 1677, p. 63). Titus is a saint, in the
Roman Catholic sense, and is commemorated January 4.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[136:609](2010073.htm#fr_608) <span
id="iii.viii.iv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p17"></span> Of Luke personally we know very
little. He is not mentioned in the Acts, and only three times in Paul’s
epistles (<span id="iii.viii.iv-p17.1"></span>[Col. iv.
14](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#014)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p17.2"></span>; [Philem.
24](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#024)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p17.3"></span>; [2 Tim. iv.
11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#011)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p17.4"></span>), from which passages we learn that he
was a physician, was one of Paul’s fellow-workers who was very dear to
him, and was with him during his last imprisonment. Irenæus, who is the
first to ascribe the third Gospel and the Acts to this Luke, seems to
know nothing more about him personally. Eusebius is the first to record
that he was born at Antioch; but the tradition must have been
universally accepted in his day, as he states it without any misgivings
and with no qualifying phrase. Jerome (*de vir. ill.* 7) and many later
writers follow Eusebius in this statement. There is no intrinsic
improbability in the tradition, which seems, in fact, to be favored by
certain minor notices in the Acts (see Schaff, *Ch. Hist.* I. 651).
Gregory Nazianzen (*Orat.* 25) says that he labored in Achaia, and in
*Orat.* 4 he calls him a martyr. Jerome (*ibid.*) says that he was
buried in Constantinople. According to Nicephorus (*H. E.* II. 43) and
later writers, Luke was a painter of great skill; but this late
tradition, of which the earlier Fathers know nothing, is quite
worthless. Epiphanius (*Hær.* II. 11) makes him one of the Seventy,
which does not accord with Luke’s own words at the beginning of his
Gospel, where he certainly implies that he himself was not an
eye-witness of the events which he records. In the same connection,
Epiphanius says that he labored in Dalmatia, Gallia, Italy, and
Macedonia,—a tradition which has about as much worth as most such
traditions in regard to the fields of labor of the various apostles and
their followers. Theophylact (*On Luke* xxiv. 13–24) records that some
supposed that he was one of the disciples with whom Christ walked to
Emmaus, and this ingenious but unfounded guess has gained some modern
supporters (e.g. Lange). He is a saint in the Roman Catholic sense, and
is commemorated October 18.

id="iii.viii.iv-p18.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p19"></span> Of Luke’s acquaintance with the other
apostles we know nothing, although, if we suppose him to have been the
author of the “We” sections in the Acts, he was with Paul in Jerusalem
at the time he was taken prisoner ([Acts
xxi](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#000)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p19.1"></span>.), when he met James at least, and
possibly others of the Twelve. It is not at all improbable that in the
course of his life he became acquainted with several of the apostles.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[136:612](2010073.htm#fr_611) <span
id="iii.viii.iv-p19.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p20"></span> The testimony to the existence of our
third Gospel, although it is not so old as that for Matthew and Mark, is
still very early. It was used by Marcion, who based upon it his own
mutilated gospel, and is quoted very frequently by Justin Martyr. The
Gospel is first distinctly ascribed to Luke by Irenæus (III. 1. 1) and
by the Muratorian Fragment. From that time on tradition was unanimous
both as to its authorship and its authority. The common opinion—still
defended by the great majority of conservative critics—has always been
that the third Gospel was written before the destruction of Jerusalem.
The radical critics of the present century, however, bring its
composition down to a latter date—ranging all the way from 70 to 140
(the latter is Baur’s date, which is now universally recognized as very
wild). Many conservative critics put its composition after the
destruction of Jerusalem on account of the peculiar form of its
eschatological discourses—e.g. Weiss, who puts it between 70 and 80
(while putting Matthew and Mark before the destruction of Jerusalem).
The traditional and still prevalent opinion is that Luke’s Gospel was
written later than those of Matthew and Mark. See the various
commentaries and New Testament Introductions, and for a clear exhibition
of the synoptical problem in general, see Schaff’s *Ch. Hist.* I. p. 607
sqq. On Luke in particular, p. 648 sqq.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[136:614](2010073.htm#fr_613) <span
id="iii.viii.iv-p21.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p22"></span> Traces of a knowledge of the Acts are
found in the Apostolic Fathers, in Justin, and in Tatian, and before the
end of the second century the book occupied a place in the Canon
undisputed except by heretics, such as the Marcionites, Manicheans, &c.
The Muratorian Fragment and Irenæus (III. 14) are the first to mention
Luke as the author of the Acts, but from that time on tradition has been
unanimous in ascribing it to him. The only exception occurs in the case
of Photius (*ad Amphil. Quæst.* 123, ed. Migne), who states that the
work was ascribed by some to Clement, by others to Barnabas, and by
others to Luke; but it is probable as Weiss remarks that Photius, in
this case, confuses the Acts with the Epistle to the Hebrews. As to the
date of its composition. Irenæus (III. 1. 1) seems (one cannot speak
with certainty, as some have done) to put it after the death of Peter
and Paul, and therefore, necessarily, the Acts still later. The
Muratorian Fragment implies that the work was written at least after the
death of Peter. Later, however, the tradition arose that the work was
written during the lifetime of Paul (so Jerome, *de vir. ill.* 7), and
this has been the prevailing opinion among conservative scholars ever
since, although many put the composition between the death of Paul and
the destruction of Jerusalem; while some (e.g. Weiss) put it after the
destruction of Jerusalem, though still assigning it to Luke. The
opposite school of critics deny Luke’s authorship, throwing the book
into the latter part of the first century (Scholten, Hilgenfeld, &c.),
or into the times of Trajan and Hadrian (e.g. Volkmar, Keim, Hausrath,
&c.). The Tübingen School saw in the Acts a “tendency-writing,” in which
the history was intentionally perverted. This theory finds few
supporters at present, even among the most extreme critics, all of whom,
however, consider the book a source of the second rank, containing much
that is legendary and distorted and irreconcilable with Paul’s Epistles,
which are looked upon as the only reliable source. The question turns
upon the relation of the author of the “we” sections to the editor of
the whole. Conservative scholars agree with universal tradition in
identifying them (though this is not necessary in order to maintain the
historical accuracy of the work), while the opposite school denies the
identity, considering the “we” sections authentic historical accounts
from the pen of a companion of Paul, which were afterward incorporated
into a larger work by one who was not a pupil of Paul. The identity of
the author of the third Gospel and of the Acts is now admitted by all
parties. See the various Commentaries and New Testament Introductions;
and upon the sources of the Acts, compare especially Weizsäcker’s
*Apost. Zeitalter,* p. 182 sqq., and Weiss’ *Einleitung,* p. 569 sq.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p24"></span> <span
id="iii.viii.iv-p24.1"></span>[Rom. ii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#016)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p24.2"></span>, xvi. 25; [2 Tim. ii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#008)<span id="iii.viii.iv-p24.3"></span>.
Eusebius uses the expression <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.iv-p24.4"></span>φασί</span>, “they say,” which seems to
imply that the interpretation was a common one in his day. Schaff (*Ch.
Hist.* I. p. 649) says that Origen also thus interpreted the passages in
Romans and Timothy referred to, but he gives no references, and I have
not been able to find in Origen’s works anything to confirm the
statement. Indeed, in commenting upon the passages in the Epistle to the
Romans he takes the words “my Gospel” to refer to the gospel preached by
Paul, not to the Gospel written by Luke. It is true, however, that in
the passage from his Commentary on Matthew, quoted by Eusebius in VI.
25, below, Origen does suppose Paul to refer to Luke and his Gospel in
<span id="iii.viii.iv-p24.5"></span>[2 Cor. viii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#018)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p24.6"></span>. The interpretation of the words
“according to my Gospel,” which Eusebius represents as common in his
day, is adopted also by Jerome (*de vir. ill.* chap. 7), but is a gross
exegetical blunder. Paul never uses the word <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.viii.iv-p24.7"></span>εὐαγγέλιον</span> in such a sense, nor is
it used by any New Testament writer to designate the gospel record, or
any one of the written Gospels. It is used always in the general sense
of “glad tidings,” or to denote the scheme of salvation, or the
substance of the gospel revelation. Eusebius is not the first to connect
Luke’s Gospel with Paul. The Muratorian Fragment speaks of Luke’s
connection with Paul, and Irenæus (III. 1. 1, quoted below in V. 8. §2)
says directly that Luke recorded the Gospel preached by Paul. Tertullian
(*Adv. Marcion.* IV. 5) tells us that Luke’s form of the Gospel is
usually ascribed to Paul, and in the same work, IV. 2, he lays down the
principle that the preaching of the disciples of the apostles needs the
authority of the apostles themselves, and it is in accord with this
principle that so much stress was laid by the early Church upon the
connection of Mark with Peter and of Luke with Paul. In chap. 24
Eusebius refers again to Luke’s relation to Paul in connection with his
Gospel, and so, too, Origen, as quoted by Eusebius, Bk. VI. chap. 25.
The Pauline nature of the Gospel has always been emphasized, and still
is by the majority of scholars. This must not be carried so far,
however, as to imply that Luke drew his materials from Paul; for Paul
himself was not an eye-witness, and Luke expressly states in his preface
the causes which induced him to write, and the sources from which he
derived his material. The influence of Paul is seen in Luke’s
standpoint, and in his general spirit—his Gospel is the Gospel of
universal salvation.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p30"></span> Clement is mentioned in [Phil. iv.
3](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#003)<span id="iii.viii.iv-p30.1"></span>,
but is not called a “fellow-soldier.” Eusebius was evidently thinking of
Paul’s references to Epaphroditus ([Philip.
2.25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p30.2"></span>[Phil. ii.
25](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#025)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p30.3"></span>) and to Archippus ([Philem.
2](../../../bib/kjv/plm001.htm#002)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p30.4"></span>), whom he calls his fellow-soldiers. The
Clement to whom Eusebius here refers was a very important personage in
the early Roman church, being known to tradition as one of its first
three bishops. He has played a prominent part in Church history on
account of the numerous writings which have passed under his name. We
know nothing certain about his life. Eusebius identifies him with the
Philippian Clement mentioned by Paul,—an identification apparently made
first by Origen, and after him repeated by a great many writers. But the
identification is, to say the least, very doubtful, and resting as it
does upon an agreement in a very common name deserves little
consideration. It was quite customary in the early Church to find Paul’s
companions, whenever possible, in responsible and influential positions
during the latter part of the first century. A more plausible theory,
which, if true, would throw an interesting light upon Clement and the
Roman church of his day, is that which identifies him with the consul
Flavius Clement, a relative of the emperor Domitian (see below, chap.
18, note 6). Some good reasons for the identification might be urged,
and his rank would then explain well Clement’s influential position in
the Church. But as pointed out in chap. 18, note 6, it is extremely
improbable that the consul Flavius Clement was a Christian; and in any
case a fatal objection to the identification (which is nevertheless
adopted by Hilgenfeld and others) is the fact that Clement is nowhere
spoken of as a martyr until the time of Rufinus, and also that no
ancient writer identifies him or connects him in any way with the
consul, although Eusebius’ mention of the latter in chap. 23 shows that
he was a well-known person. When we remember the tendency of the early
Church to make all its heroes martyrs, and to ascribe high birth to
them, the omission in this case renders the identification, we may say,
virtually impossible. More probable is the conjecture of Lightfoot, that
he was a freedman belonging to the family of the consul Clement, whose
name he bore. This is simply conjecture, however, and is supported by no
testimony. Whoever Clement was, he occupied a very prominent position in
the early Roman church, and wrote an epistle to the Corinthians which is
still extant (see below, chap. 16; and upon the works falsely ascribed
to him, see chap. 38). In regard to his place in the succession of Roman
bishops, see chap. 2, note 1, above. For a full account of Clement, see
especially Harnack’s Prolegomena to his edition of Clement’s Epistle
(*Patrum Apost. Opera,* Vol. 1.), Salmon’s article, *Clemens Romanus,*
in the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.,* Schaff’s *Ch. Hist.* II. 636 sq., and
Donaldson’s *Hist. of Christ. Lit. and Doctrine,* I. p. 90 sq.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p32"></span> [Acts xvii.
34](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#034)<span
id="iii.viii.iv-p32.1"></span>. This Dionysius has played an important
part in Church history, as the pretended author of a series of very
remarkable writings, which pass under the name of Dionysius, the
Areopagite, but which in reality date from the fifth or sixth century
and probably owe their origin to the influence of Neo-Platonism. The
first mention of these writings is in the records of the Council of
Constantinople (532 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.iv-p32.2"></span>a.d.</span>); but from that time on they
were constantly used and unanimously ascribed to Dionysius, the
Areopagite, until, in the seventeenth century, their claims to so great
antiquity were disputed. They are still defended, however, in the face
of the most positive evidence, by many Roman Catholic writers. The
influence of these works upon the theology of the Middle Ages was
prodigious. Scholasticism may be said to be based upon them, for Thomas
Aquinas used them, perhaps, more than any other source; so much so, that
he has been said “to have drawn his whole theological system from
Dionysius.”

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p33"></span>Our Dionysius has had the further
honor of being identified by tradition with Dionysius (St. Denis), the
patron saint of France,—an identification which we may follow the most
loyal of the French in accepting, if we will, though we shall be obliged
to suppose that our Dionysius lived to the good old age of two to three
hundred years.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p34"></span>The statement of Dionysius of Corinth
that the Areopagite was bishop of Athens (repeated by Eusebius again in
Bk. IV. chap. 23) is the usual unwarranted throwing back of a second
century conception into the first century. That Dionysius held a
position of influence among the few Christians whom Paul left in Athens
is highly probable, and the tradition that later he was made the first
bishop there is quite natural. The church of Athens plays no part in the
history of the apostolic age, and it is improbable that there was any
organization there until many years after Paul’s visit; for even in the
time of Dionysius of Corinth, the church there seems to have been
extremely small and weak (cf. Bk. IV. chap. 23, §2). Upon Dionysius and
the writings ascribed to him, see especially the article of Lupton in
the *Dict. of Christ. Biog.* I. p. 841–848.
