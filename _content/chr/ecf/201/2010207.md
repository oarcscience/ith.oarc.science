<span id="iii.xi.xxxvii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxvii-p3.1"></span>About</span> the same time others arose
in Arabia, putting forward a doctrine foreign to the truth. They said
that during the present time the human soul dies and perishes with the
body, but that at the time of the resurrection they will be renewed
together. And at that time also a synod of considerable size assembled,
and Origen, being again invited thither, spoke publicly on the question
with such effect that the opinions of those who had formerly fallen were
changed.

<span id="iii.xi.xxxvii-p2"></span> The exact nature of the heresy which
is here described by Eusebius is somewhat difficult to determine. It is
disputed whether these heretics are to be reckoned with the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>θνητοπσυχίται</span>
(whom John of Damascus mentions in his *de Hæres.* c. 90, and to whom
Augustine refers, under the name of *Arabici,* in his *de Hæres,* c.
83), that is, those who taught the death of the soul with the body, or
with the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxvii-p2.2"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxxvii-p2.3"></span>πνοψυχίται</span>, who taught that the
soul slept between the death and the resurrection of the body.
Redepenning, in a very thorough discussion of the matter (II. 105 sq.),
concludes that the heresy to which Eusebius refers grew up under Jewish
influence, which was very strong in Arabia, and that it did not teach
the death (as Eusebius asserts), but only the slumber of the soul. He
reckons them therefore with the second, not the first, class mentioned.
But it seems to me that Redepenning is almost hypercritical in
maintaining that it is impossible that these heretics can have taught
that the soul died and afterward was raised again; for it is no more
impossible that they should have taught it than that Eusebius and others
should have supposed that they did. In fact, there does not seem to be
adequate ground for correcting Eusebius’ statement, which describes
heretics who must distinctly be classed with the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xxxvii-p2.4"></span>θνητοπσυχίται</span>
mentioned later by John of Damascus. We do not know the date at which
the synod referred to in this chapter was held. We only know that it was
subsequent to the one which dealt with Beryllus, and therefore it must
have been toward the close of Philip’s reign.
