<span id="iv.vii.xiv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIV</span>.—*That Created Nature
differs infinitely from Uncreated Being; to which Man makes the Nearest
Approach by a Life of Virtue.*

<span id="iv.vii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Surely</span> it must be the very height of
folly to compare created with eternal things, which latter have neither
beginning nor end, while the former, having been originated and called
into being, and having received a commencement of their existence at
some definite time, must consequently, of necessity have an end. How
then can things which have thus been made, bear comparison with him who
has ordained their being? Were this the case, <span
id="fr_3438"></span>[3439](#fn_3438) the power to command their
existence could not rightly be attributed to him. Nor can celestial
things be compared to him, any more than the material <span
id="fr_3439"></span>[3440](#fn_3439) with the intellectual <span
id="fr_3440"></span>[3441](#fn_3440) world, or copies with the models
from which they are formed. Nay, is it not absurd thus to confound all
things, and to obscure the honor of God by comparing him with men, or
even with beasts? And is it not characteristic of madmen, utterly
estranged from a life of sobriety and virtue, to affect a power
equivalent to that of God? If indeed we in any sense aspire to
blessedness like that of God, our duty is to lead a life according to
his commandments: so shall we, having finished a course consistent with
the laws which he has prescribed, dwell for ever superior to the power
of fate, in eternal and undecaying mansions. For the only power in man
which can be elevated to a comparison with that of God, is sincere and
guileless service and devotion of heart to himself, with the
contemplation and study of whatever pleases him, the raising our
affections above the things of earth, and directing our thoughts, as far
as we may, to high and heavenly objects: for from such endeavors, it is
said, a victory accrues to us more valuable than <span id="page_572">p.
572</span> <span id="iv.vii.xiv-Page_572"></span>many blessings. <span
id="fr_3441"></span>[3442](#fn_3441) The cause, then, of that difference
which subsists, as regards the inequality both of dignity and power in
created beings, is such as I have described. In this the wise acquiesce
with abundant thankfulness and joy: while those who are dissatisfied,
display their own folly, and their arrogance will reap its due reward.

id="iv.vii.xiv-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xiv-p3"></span> This is following with Heinichen, and
meets the conjecture of Valesius as over against the <span
class="c13"><span id="iv.vii.xiv-p3.1"></span>mss.</span> and other
conjectures, which, substituting <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.xiv-p3.2"></span>μανία</span> for <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.xiv-p3.3"></span>ὅ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.xiv-p3.4"></span>μοια</span>, read “for if it be madness to
liken these things to him,” &c.

<span id="fn_3439"></span>[571:3440](2010676.htm#fr_3439) <span
id="iv.vii.xiv-p3.5"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xiv-p4"></span> Or “sensible”; i.e. world of sense or
perception.

<span id="fn_3440"></span>[571:3441](2010676.htm#fr_3440) <span
id="iv.vii.xiv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xiv-p5"></span> This is the word often rendered by
*Bag.* as “spiritual.”

id="iv.vii.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.vii.xiv-p6"></span> This is supposed to refer to <span
id="iv.vii.xiv-p6.1"></span>[Rev. ii.
7-10](../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#007)<span
id="iv.vii.xiv-p6.2"></span>; iii. 11, &c. It might well have in mind
<span id="iv.vii.xiv-p6.3"></span>[Col. iii.
2-4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#002)<span id="iv.vii.xiv-p6.4"></span>,
or best of all [Rev. xxi. 7](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#007)<span
id="iv.vii.xiv-p6.5"></span>, as containing the thought of victory
(<span class="Greek"><span id="iv.vii.xiv-p6.6"></span>νικ€ω</span> =
“overcome”).
