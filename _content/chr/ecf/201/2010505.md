<span id="iv.vi.ii.lx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lx-p1.1"></span>Chapter LX</span>.—*An Admonition at the
Close of the Edict, that No One should trouble his Neighbor.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lx-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lx-p2.1"></span>Once</span> more, let none use that to the
detriment of another which he may himself have received on conviction of
its truth; but let every one, if it be possible, apply what he has
understood and known to the benefit of his neighbor; if otherwise, let
him relinquish the attempt. For it is one thing voluntarily to undertake
the conflict for immortality, another to compel others to do so from the
fear of punishment.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lx-p3"></span>“These are our words; and we have
enlarged on these topics more than our ordinary clemency would have
dictated, because we were unwilling to dissemble or be false to the true
faith; and the more so, since we understand there are some who say that
the rites of the heathen temples, and the power of darkness, have been
entirely removed. We should indeed have earnestly <span id="page_515">p.
515</span> <span id="iv.vi.ii.lx-Page_515"></span>recommended such
removal to all men, were it not that the rebellious spirit of those
wicked errors still continues obstinately fixed in the minds of some, so
as to discourage the hope of any general restoration of mankind to the
ways of truth.” <span id="fr_3205"></span>[3206](#fn_3205)
