<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*Of his Picture
surmounted by a Cross and having beneath it a Dragon.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>And</span> besides this, he caused to be
painted on a lofty tablet, and set up in the front of the portico of his
palace, so as to be visible to all, a representation of the salutary
sign placed above his head, and below it that hateful and savage
adversary of mankind, who by means of the tyranny of the ungodly had
wasted the Church of God, falling headlong, under the form of a dragon,
to the abyss of destruction. For the sacred oracles in the books of
God’s prophets have described him as a dragon and a crooked
serpent; <span id="fr_3229"></span>[3230](#fn_3229) and for this reason
the emperor thus publicly displayed a painted <span
id="fr_3230"></span>[3231](#fn_3230) resemblance of the dragon beneath
his own and his children’s feet, stricken through with a dart, and cast
headlong into the depths of the sea.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p5"></span>In this manner he intended to
represent the secret adversary of the human race, and to indicate that
he was consigned to the gulf of perdition by virtue of the salutary
trophy placed above his head. This allegory, then, was thus conveyed by
means of the colors of a picture: and I am filled with wonder at the
intellectual greatness of the emperor, who as if by divine inspiration
thus expressed what the prophets had foretold concerning this monster,
saying that “God would bring his great and strong and terrible sword
against the dragon, the flying serpent; and would destroy the dragon
that was in the sea.” <span id="fr_3231"></span>[3232](#fn_3231) This it
was of which the emperor gave a true and faithful representation in the
picture above described.

translation, as it corresponds with the Hebrew against the LXX. It
differs in the word used for “terrible,” and none of the editions (or at
least not the Vatican, Holmes and Parsons, Van Ess, or Tischendorf) and
none of the <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.iii-p6.2"></span>mss.</span> cited by Holmes and Parsons,
have the phrase “in the sea” as the Hebrew. Grabe has this latter as
various reading (ed. Bagster, 16º, p. 74), but there is hardly a
possibility that it is the true reading.
