<p class="c47"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p1"></A>  <span class="c11"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXII.&#8212;</span><i>Paul having been sent bound from Judea to Rome, made his Defense, and was acquitted of every Charge.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p2"></A>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p2.1"></A>Festus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_468"></A><A HREF="#fn_468"><FONT SIZE="1">469</FONT></A>
</span> was sent by Nero to be Felix&#146;s successor. Under him Paul, having made his defense, was sent bound to Rome.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="#fn_469"><FONT SIZE="1">470</FONT></A>
 Aristarchus was with him, whom he also somewhere in his epistles quite naturally calls his fellow-prisoner.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_470"></A><A HREF="#fn_470"><FONT SIZE="1">471</FONT></A>
 <A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vii.xxiii-Page_124"></A>And Luke, who wrote the Acts of the Apostles,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_471"></A><A HREF="#fn_471"><FONT SIZE="1">472</FONT></A>
 brought his history to a close at this point, after stating that Paul spent two whole years at Rome as a prisoner at large, and preached the word of God without restraint.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_472"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">473</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p8"></A>2. Thus after he had made his defense it is said that the apostle was sent again upon the ministry of preaching,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_473"></A><A HREF="#fn_473"><FONT SIZE="1">474</FONT></A>
 and that upon coming to the same city a second time he suffered martyrdom.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_474"></A><A HREF="#fn_474"><FONT SIZE="1">475</FONT></A>
 In this imprisonment he wrote his second epistle to Timothy,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_475"></A><A HREF="#fn_475"><FONT SIZE="1">476</FONT></A>
 in which he mentions his first defense and his impending death.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p12"></A>3. But hear his testimony on these matters: &#8220;At my first answer,&#8221; he says, &#8220;no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">477</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p14"></A>4. He plainly indicates in these words that on the former occasion, in order that the preaching might be fulfilled by him, he was rescued from the mouth of the lion, referring, in this expression, to Nero, as is probable on account of the latter&#146;s cruelty. He did not therefore afterward add the similar statement, &#8220;He will rescue me from the mouth of the lion&#8221;; for he saw in the spirit that his end would not be long delayed.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p15"></A>5. Wherefore he adds to the words, &#8220;And he delivered me from the mouth of the lion,&#8221; this sentence: &#8220;The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">478</FONT></A>
 indicating his speedy martyrdom; which he also foretells still more clearly in the same epistle, when he writes, &#8220;For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">479</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p18"></A>6. In his second epistle to Timothy, moreover, he indicates that Luke was with him when he wrote,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">480</FONT></A>
 but at his first defense not even he.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">481</FONT></A>
 Whence it is probable that Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles at that time, continuing his history down to the period when he was with Paul.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">482</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p22"></A>7. But these things have been adduced by us to show that Paul&#146;s martyrdom did not take place at the time of that Roman sojourn which Luke <A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vii.xxiii-Page_125"></A>records.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p23"></A>8. It is probable indeed that as Nero was more disposed to mildness in the beginning, Paul&#146;s defense of his doctrine was more easily received; but that when he had advanced to the commission of lawless deeds of daring, he made the apostles as well as others the subjects of his attacks.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">483</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p3"></A> The exact year of the accession of Festus is not known, but it is known that his death occurred before the summer of 62 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p3.1"></A>a.d.</span>; for at that time his successor, Albinus, was already procurator, as we can see from Josephus, <i>B. J.</i> VI. 5. 3. But from the events recorded by Josephus as happening during his term of office, we know he must have been procurator at least a year; his accession, therefore, took place certainly as early as 61 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p3.2"></A>a.d.</span>, and probably at least a year earlier, i.e. in 60 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p3.3"></A>a.d.</span>, the date fixed by Wieseler. The widest possible margin for his accession is from 59&#8211;61. Upon this whole question, see Wieseler, p. 66 sqq. Festus died while in office. He seems to have been a just and capable governor,&#8212;in this quite a contrast to his predecessor.</p>
<A NAME="fn_469"></A><A HREF="2010064.htm#fr_469">123:470</A> <a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p3.4"></A>

The determination of the year in which Paul was sent as a prisoner to Rome depends in part upon the determination of the year of Festus&#146; accession. He was in Rome (which he reached in the spring) at least two years before the Neronic persecution (June, 64 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p4.2"></A>a.d.</span>), therefore as early as 62 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p4.3"></A>a.d.</span> He was sent from C&aelig;sarea the previous autumn, therefore as early as the autumn of 61. If Festus became procurator in 61, this must have been the date. But if, as is probable, Festus became procurator in 60, then Paul was sent to Rome in the autumn of the same year, and reached Rome in the spring of 61. This is now the commonly accepted date; but the year 62 cannot be shut out (cf. Wieseler, <i>ibid.</i>). Wieseler shows conclusively that Festus cannot have become procurator before 60 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p4.4"></A>a.d.</span>, and hence Paul cannot have been taken to Rome before the fall of that year.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p9"></A> Eusebius is the first writer to record the release of Paul from a first, and his martyrdom during a second Roman imprisonment. He introduces the statement with the formula <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p9.1"></A>&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#382;&#967;&#949;&#953;</span>, which indicates probably that he has only an oral tradition as his authority, and his efforts to establish the fact by exegetical arguments show how weak the tradition was. Many maintain that Eusebius follows no tradition here, but records simply his own conclusion formed from a study of the Pastoral Epistles, which apparently necessitate a second imprisonment. But were this the case, he would hardly have used the formula <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p9.2"></A>&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#382;&#967;&#949;&#953;</span>. The report may have arisen solely upon exegetical grounds, but it can hardly have originated with Eusebius himself. In accordance with this tradition, Eusebius, in his <i>Chron.,</i> gives the date of Paul&#146;s death as 67 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p9.3"></A>a.d.</span> Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> 5) and other later writers follow Eusebius (though Jerome gives the date as 68 instead of 67), and the tradition soon became firmly established (see below, chap. 25, note 5). Scholars are greatly divided as to the fact of a second imprisonment. Nearly all that defend the genuineness of the Pastoral Epistles assume a second imprisonment, though some (e.g. Wieseler, Ebrard, Reuss and others) defend the epistles while assuming only one imprisonment; but this is very difficult. On the other hand, most opponents of the epistles (e.g. the T&uuml;bingen critics and the majority of the new critical school) deny the second imprisonment. As to the place where Paul spent the interval&#8212;supposing him to have been released&#8212;there is again a difference of opinion. The Pastoral Epistles, if assumed to be genuine, seem to necessitate another visit to the Orient. But for such a visit there is no ancient tradition, although Paul himself, in the Epistle to the Philippians, expresses his expectation of making such a visit. On the other hand, there is an old tradition that he visited Spain (which must of course have been during this interval, as he did not reach it before the first imprisonment). The Muratorian Fragment (from the end of the second century) records this tradition in a way to imply that it was universally known. Clement of Rome (<i>Epistle to the Corinthians,</i> c. 5.) is also claimed as a witness for such a visit, but the interpretation of his words is doubtful, so that little weight can be laid upon his statement. In later times the tradition of this visit to Spain dropped out of the Church. The strongest argument against the visit is the absence of any trace of it in Spain itself. If any church there could have claimed the great apostle to the Gentiles as its founder, it seems that it must have asserted its claim and the tradition have been preserved at least in that church. This appears to the writer a fatal argument against a journey to Spain. On the other hand, the absence of all tradition of another journey to the Orient does not militate against such a visit, for tradition at any place might easily preserve the fact of a visit of the apostle, without preserving an accurate account of the number of his visits if more than one were made. Of the defenders of the Pastoral Epistles, that accept a second imprisonment, some assume simply a journey to the Orient, others assume also the journey to Spain. Between the spring of 63 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p9.4"></A>a.d.</span>, the time when he was probably released, if released, and the date of his death (at the earliest the summer of 64), there is time enough, but barely so, for both journeys. If the date of Paul&#146;s death be put later with Eusebius and Jerome (as many modern critics put it), the time is of course quite sufficient. Compare the various Lives of Paul, Commentaries, etc., and especially, among recent works, Schaff&#146;s <i>Church Hist.</i> I. p. 231 sqq.; Weiss&#146; <i>Einleitung in das N. T.</i> p. 283 sqq.; Holtzmann&#146;s <i>Einleitung,</i> p. 295 sqq.; and Weizs&auml;cker&#146;s <i>Apostolisches Zeitalter,</i> p. 453 sqq.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p11"></A> Eusebius looked upon the Pastoral Epistles as undoubtedly genuine, and placed them among the <i>Homologumena,</i> or undisputed writings (compare Bk. III. chaps. 3 and 25). The external testimony for them is very strong, but their genuineness has, during the present century, been quite widely denied upon internal grounds. The advanced critical scholars of Germany treat their non-Pauline authorship as completely established, and many otherwise conservative scholars follow their lead. It is impossible here to give the various arguments for or against their genuineness; we may refer the reader particularly to Holtzmann&#146;s <i>Die Pastoralbriefe, kritisch und exegetisch behandelt</i> (1880), and to his <i>Einleitung</i> (1886), for the most complete presentation of the case against the genuineness; and to Weiss&#146; <i>Einleitung in das N. T.</i> (1886), p. 286 sqq., and to his Commentary on the Pastoral Epistles, in the fifth edition of the Meyer Series, for a defense of their genuineness, and also to Woodruff&#146;s article in the <i>Andover Review,</i> October, 1886, for a brief and somewhat popular discussion of the subject. The second epistle must have been written latest of all Paul&#146;s epistles, just before his death,&#8212;at the termination of his second captivity, or of his first, if his second be denied.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p21"></A> This is a very commonly accepted opinion among conservative commentators, who thus explain the lack of mention of the persecution of Nero and of the death of Paul. On the other hand, some who accept Luke&#146;s authorship of the Acts, put the composition into the latter part of the century and explain the omission of the persecution and the death of Paul from the object of the work, e.g. Weiss, who dates the Gospel of Luke between 70 and 80, and thus brings the Acts down to a still later date (see his <i>Einleitung,</i> p. 585 sqq.). It is now becoming quite generally admitted that Luke&#146;s Gospel was written after the destruction of Jerusalem, and if this be so, the Acts must have been written still later. There is in fact no reason for supposing the book to have been written at the point of time at which its account of Paul ceases. The design of the book (its text is found in the eighth verse of the first chapter) was to give an account of the progress of the Church from Jerusalem to Rome, not to write the life of Paul. The record of Paul&#146;s death at the close of the book would have been quite out of harmony with this design, and would have formed a decided anti-climax, as the author was wise enough to understand. He was writing, not a life of Paul, nor of any apostle or group of apostles, but a history of the planting of the Church of Christ. The advanced critics, who deny that the Acts were written by a pupil of Paul, of course put its composition much later,&#8212;some into the time of Domitian, most into the second century. But even such critics admit the genuineness of certain portions of the book (the celebrated &#8220;We&#8221; passages), and the old T&uuml;bingen theory of intentional misrepresentation on the part of the author is finding less favor even among the most radical critics.</p>
<A NAME="fn_482"></A><A HREF="2010064.htm#fr_482">125:483</A> <a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p23.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii.xxiii-p24"></A> Whether Eusebius&#146; conclusion be correct or not, it is a fact that Nero became much more cruel and tyrannical in the latter part of his reign. The famous &#8220;first five years,&#8221; however exaggerated the reports about them, must at least have been of a very different character from the remainder of his reign. But those five years of clemency and justice were past before Paul reached Rome.</p>
