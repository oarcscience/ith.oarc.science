<span id="iii.x.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII.—</span>*The Statements of
Irenæus in regard to the Divine Scriptures.*

<span id="iii.x.ix-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p2.1"></span>Since</span>, in the beginning of this
work, <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465) we promised to give,
when needful, the words of the ancient presbyters and writers of the
Church, in which they have declared those traditions which came down to
them concerning the canonical books, and since Irenæus was one of them,
we will now give his words and, first, what he says of the sacred
Gospels: <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p5"></span>2. “Matthew published his Gospel among the
Hebrews in their own language, <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467) while Peter and Paul were preaching
and founding the church in Rome. <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p8"></span>3. After their departure Mark, the
disciple and interpreter of Peter, also transmitted to us in writing
those things which Peter had preached; <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469) and Luke, the attendant of Paul,
recorded in a book the Gospel which Paul had declared. <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p11"></span>4. Afterwards John, the disciple of the
Lord, who also reclined on his bosom, published his Gospel, while
staying at Ephesus in Asia.” <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p13"></span>5. He states these things in the third
book of his above-mentioned work. In the fifth book he speaks as follows
concerning the Apocalypse of John, and the number of the name of
Antichrist: <span id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p15"></span>“As these things are so, and this number
is found in all the approved and ancient copies, <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473) and those who saw John face to face
confirm it, and reason teaches us that the number of the name of the
beast, according to the mode of calculation among the Greeks, appears in
its letters.…” <span id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p18"></span>6. And farther on he says concerning the
same: <span id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p20"></span>“We are not bold enough to speak
confidently of the name of Antichrist. For if it were necessary that his
name should be declared clearly at the present time, it would have been
announced by him who saw the revelation. For it was seen, not long ago,
but almost in our generation, toward the end of the reign of
Domitian.” <span id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p22"></span>7. He states these things concerning the
Apocalypse <span id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477) in the work
referred to. He also mentions the first Epistle of John, <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478) taking <span id="page_223">p.
223</span> <span id="iii.x.ix-Page_223"></span>many proofs from it, and
likewise the first Epistle of Peter. <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479) And he not only knows, but also
receives, The Shepherd, <span id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480)
writing as follows: <span id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p28"></span>“Well did the Scripture <span
id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482) speak, saying, <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483) ‘First of all believe that God is
one, who has created and completed all things,’” &c.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p31"></span>8. And he uses almost the precise words
of the Wisdom of Solomon, saying: <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484) “The vision of God produces
immortality, but immortality renders us near to God.” He mentions also
the memoirs <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485) of a certain
apostolic presbyter, <span id="fr_1486"></span>[1487](#fn_1486) whose
name he passes by in silence, and gives his expositions of the sacred
Scriptures.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p35"></span>9. And he refers to Justin the
Martyr, <span id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487) and to
Ignatius, <span id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488) using testimonies
also from their writings. Moreover, he promises to refute Marcion from
his own writings, in a special work. <span
id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p40"></span>10. Concerning the translation of the
inspired <span id="fr_1490"></span>[1491](#fn_1490) Scriptures by the
Seventy, hear the very words which he writes: <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[1492](#fn_1491)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p43"></span>“God in truth became man, and the Lord
himself saved us, giving the sign of the virgin; but not as some say,
who now venture to translate the Scripture, ‘Behold, a young woman shall
conceive and bring forth a son,’ <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[1493](#fn_1492) as Theodotion of Ephesus and Aquila
of Pontus, <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493) both of them
Jewish proselytes, interpreted; following whom, the Ebionites say <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[1495](#fn_1494) that he was begotten by Joseph.”

<span id="iii.x.ix-p47"></span>11. Shortly after he adds:

<span id="iii.x.ix-p48"></span>“For before the Romans had established
their empire, while the Macedonians were still holding Asia, Ptolemy,
the son of Lagus, <span id="fr_1495"></span>[1496](#fn_1495) being
desirous of adorning the library which he had founded in Alexandria with
the meritorious writings of all men, requested the people of Jerusalem
to have their Scriptures translated into the Greek language.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p51"></span>12. But, as they were then subject to the
Macedonians, they sent to Ptolemy seventy elders, who were the most
skilled among them in the Scriptures and in both languages. Thus God
accomplished his purpose. <span id="fr_1496"></span>[1497](#fn_1496)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p53"></span>13. But wishing to try them individ<span
id="page_224">p. 224</span> <span id="iii.x.ix-Page_224"></span>ually,
as he feared lest, by taking counsel together, they might conceal the
truth of the Scriptures by their interpretation, he separated them from
one another, and commanded all of them to write the same
translation. <span id="fr_1497"></span>[1498](#fn_1497) He did this for
all the books.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p55"></span>14. But when they came together in the
presence of Ptolemy, and compared their several translations, God was
glorified, and the Scriptures were recognized as truly divine. For all
of them had rendered the same things in the same words and with the same
names from beginning to end, so that the heathen perceived that the
Scriptures had been translated by the inspiration <span
id="fr_1498"></span>[1499](#fn_1498) of God.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p57"></span>15. And this was nothing wonderful for
God to do, who, in the captivity of the people under Nebuchadnezzar,
when the Scriptures had been destroyed, and the Jews had returned to
their own country after seventy years, afterwards, in the time of
Artaxerxes, king of the Persians, inspired Ezra the priest, of the tribe
of Levi, to relate all the words of the former prophets, and to restore
to the people the legislation of Moses.” <span
id="fr_1499"></span>[1500](#fn_1499)

<span id="iii.x.ix-p59"></span>Such are the words of Irenæus.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p3"></span> Eusebius is apparently thinking of the
preface to his work contained in Bk. I. chap. 1, but there he makes no
such promise as he refers to here. He speaks only of his general purpose
to mention those men who preached the divine word either orally or in
writing. In Bk. III. chap. 3, however, he distinctly promises to do what
he here speaks of doing, and perhaps remembered only that he had made
such a promise without recalling where he had made it.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p6"></span> See above, Bk. III. chap. 24, note 5.
Irenæus, in this chapter traces the four Gospels back to the apostles
themselves, but he is unable to say that Matthew translated his Gospel
into Greek, which is of course bad for his theory, as the Matthew Gospel
which the Church of his time had was in Greek, not in Hebrew. He puts
the Hebrew Gospel, however, upon a par with the three Greek ones, and
thus, although he does not say it directly, endeavors to convey the
impression that the apostolicity of the Hebrew Matthew is a guarantee
for the Greek Matthew also. Of Papias’ statement, “Each one translated
the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew as he was able,” he could of course make no
use even if he was acquainted with it. Whether his account was dependent
upon Papias’ or not we cannot tell.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p14"></span> Irenæus, *Adv. Hær.* V. 30. 1.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p16"></span> [Rev. xiii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#018)<span id="iii.x.ix-p16.1"></span>.
Already in Irenæus’ time there was a variation in the copies of the
Apocalypse. This is interesting as showing the existence of old copies
of the Apocalypse even in his time, and also as showing how early works
became corrupted in the course of transmission. We learn from his words,
too, that textual criticism had already begun.

<span id="fn_1474"></span>[222:1475](2010149.htm#fr_1474) <span
id="iii.x.ix-p16.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p17"></span> The sentence as Eusebius quotes it here
is incomplete; he repeats only so much of it as suits his purpose.
Irenæus completes his sentence, after a few more dependent clauses, by
saying, “I do not know how it is that some have erred, following the
ordinary mode of speech, and have vitiated the middle number in the
name,” &c. This shows that even in Irenæus’ time there was as much
controversy about the interpretation of the Apocalypse as there has
always been, and that at that day exegetes were as a rule in no better
position than we are. Irenæus refers in this sentence to the fact that
the Greek numerals were indicated by the letters of the alphabet: Alpha,
“one,” Beta, “two,” &c.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p24"></span> In *Adv. Hær.* III. 16. 5, 8. Irenæus
also quotes from the second Epistle of John, without distinguishing it
from the first, in III. 16. 8, and I. 16. 3. Upon John’s epistles, see
Bk. III. chap. 24, notes 18 and 19.

and V. 7. 2 he quotes from the first Epistle of Peter, with the formula
“Peter says.” He is the first one to connect the epistle with Peter. See
above, Bk. III. chap. 3, note 1.

id="iii.x.ix-p29.1"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p29.2"></span>γραφή</span>, the regular word used in
quoting Scripture. Many of the Fathers of the second and third centuries
used this word in referring to Clement, Hermas, Barnabas, and other
works of the kind (compare especially Clement of Alexandria’s use of the
word).

id="iii.x.ix-p31.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p32"></span> *Adv. Hær.* IV. 38. 3. Irenæus in this
passage quotes freely from the apocryphal Book of Wisdom, VI. 19,
without mentioning the source of his quotation, and indeed without in
any way indicating the fact that he is quoting.

<span id="fn_1485"></span>[223:1486](2010149.htm#fr_1485) <span

id="iii.x.ix-p33.2"></span>πομνημονευμ€των</span>. Written memoirs are
hardly referred to here, but rather oral comments, expositions, or
accounts of the interpretations of the apostles and others of the first
generation of Christians.

<span id="fn_1486"></span>[223:1487](2010149.htm#fr_1486) <span
id="iii.x.ix-p33.3"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p34"></span> *Adv. Hær.* IV. 27. 1, where Irenæus
mentions a “certain presbyter who had heard it from those who had seen
the apostles,” &c. Who this presbyter was cannot be determined.
Polycarp, Papias, and others have been suggested, but we have no grounds
upon which to base a decision, though we may perhaps safely conclude
that so prominent a man as Polycarp would hardly have been referred to
in such an indefinite way; and Papias seems ruled out by the fact that
the presbyter is here not made a hearer of the apostles themselves,
while in V. 33. 4 Papias is expressly stated to have been a hearer of
John,—undoubtedly in Irenæus’ mind the evangelist John (see above, Bk.
III. chap. 39, note 4). Other anonymous authorities under the titles,
“One superior to us,” “One before us,” &c., are quoted by Irenæus in
*Præf.* §2, I. 13. 3, III. 17. 4, etc. See Routh, *Rel. Sacræ,* I.
45–68.

<span id="fn_1487"></span>[223:1488](2010149.htm#fr_1487) <span
id="iii.x.ix-p35.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p36"></span> In *Adv. Hær.* IV. 6. 2, where he
mentions Justin Martyr and quotes from his work *Against Marcion* (see
Eusebius, Bk. IV. chap. 18), and also in *Adv. Hær.* V. 26. 2, where he
mentions him again by name and quotes from some unknown work (but see
above, *ibid.* note 15).

<span id="fn_1488"></span>[223:1489](2010149.htm#fr_1488) <span
id="iii.x.ix-p36.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p37"></span> Irenæus nowhere mentions Ignatius by
name, but in V. 28. 4 he quotes from his epistle to the Romans, chap. 4,
under the formula, “A certain one of our people said, when he was
condemned to the wild beasts.” It is interesting to note how diligently
Eusebius had read the works of Irenæus, and extracted from them all that
could contribute to his *History.*

<span id="iii.x.ix-p38"></span>Upon Ignatius, see above, III. 36.

<span id="fn_1489"></span>[223:1490](2010149.htm#fr_1489) <span
id="iii.x.ix-p38.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p39"></span> *Adv. Hær.* I. 27. 4, III. 12. 12. This
promise was apparently never fulfilled, as we hear nothing of the work
from any of Irenæus’ successors. But in Bk. IV. chap. 25 Eusebius speaks
of Irenæus as one of those who had written against Marcion, whether in
this referring to his special work promised here, or only to his general
work *Adv. Hær.,* we cannot tell.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p44"></span> [Isa. vii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)<span id="iii.x.ix-p44.1"></span>.
The original Hebrew has <span class="Hebrew"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p44.2"></span>עַלְמָה</span>, which means simply a “young
woman,” not distinctively a “virgin.” The LXX, followed by [Matt. i.
23](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023)<span id="iii.x.ix-p44.3"></span>,
wrongly translated by <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p44.4"></span>παρθένος</span>, “virgin” (cf. Toy’s
*Quotations in the New Testament*, p. 1 sqq., and the various
commentaries on Matthew). Theodotion and Aquila translated the Hebrew
word by <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p44.5"></span>νεᾶνις</span>, which is the correct
rendering, in spite of what Irenæus says. The complete dependence of the
Fathers upon the LXX, and their consequent errors as to the meaning of
the original, are well illustrated in this case (cf. also Justin’s
*Dial*. chap. 71).

<span id="fn_1493"></span>[223:1494](2010149.htm#fr_1493) <span
id="iii.x.ix-p44.6"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p45"></span> This is the earliest direct reference to
the translations of Aquila and Theodotion, though Hermas used the
version of the latter, as pointed out by Hort (see above, Bk. III. chap.
3, note 23). Upon the two versions, see Bk. VI. chap. 16, notes 3 and 5.

id="iii.x.ix-p48.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p49"></span> Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, or Ptolemy
Soter (the Preserver), was king of Egypt from 323–285 (283) <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.x.ix-p49.1"></span>b.c.</span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p50"></span>The following story in regard to the
origin of the LXX is first told in a spurious letter (probably dating
from the first century <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p50.1"></span>b.c.</span>), which professes to have been
written by Aristeas, a high officer at the court of Ptolemy Philadelphus
(285 \[283\]-247 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p50.2"></span>b.c.</span>). This epistle puts the origin of
the LXX in the reign of the latter monarch instead of in that of his
father, Ptolemy Soter, and is followed in this by Philo, Josephus,
Tertullian, and most of the other ancient writers (Justin Martyr calls
the king simply Ptolemy, while Clement of Alex. says that some connect
the event with the one monarch, others with the other). The account
given in the letter (which is printed by Gallandius, *Bibl. Patr.* II.
771, as well as in many other editions) is repeated over and over again,
with greater or less variations, by early Jewish and Christian writers
(e.g. by Philo, *Vit. Mos.* 2; by Josephus, *Ant.* XII. 2; by Justin
Martyr, *Apol.* I. 31; by Clement of Alexandria, *Strom.* I. 22; by
Tertullian, *Apol.* 18, and others; see the article *Aristeas* in
Smith’s *Dict. of Greek and Roman Biog.*). It gives the number of the
elders as seventy-two,—six from each tribe. That this marvelous tale is
a fiction is clear enough, but whether it is based upon a groundwork of
fact is disputed (see Schürer, *Gesch. der Juden im Zeitalter Jesu
Christi,* II. p. 697 sqq.). It is at any rate certain that the
Pentateuch (the original account applies only to the Pentateuch, but
later it was extended to the entire Old Testament) was translated into
Greek in Alexandria as early as the third century <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.x.ix-p50.3"></span>b.c.</span>; whether under
Ptolemy Philadelphus, and at his desire, we cannot tell. The translation
of the remainder of the Old Testament followed during the second century
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.x.ix-p50.4"></span>b.c.</span>, the
books being translated at various times by unknown authors, but all or
most of them probably in Egypt (see Schürer, *ibid.*). It was, of
course, to the interest of the Christians to maintain the miraculous
origin of the LXX, for otherwise they would have to yield to the attacks
of the Jews, who often taunted them with having only a translation of
the Scriptures. Accepting the miraculous origin of the LXX, the
Christians, on the other hand, could accuse the Jews of falsifying their
Hebrew copies wherever they differed from the LXX, making the latter the
only authoritative standard (cf. Justin Martyr’s *Dial.* chap. 71, and
many other passages in the work). Upon the attitude of the Christians,
and the earlier and later attitude of the Jews toward the LXX, see
below, Bk. VI. chap. 16, note 8.

<span id="iii.x.ix-p52"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p52.1"></span>ποιήσαντος τοῦ θεοῦ ὅπερ ἡβούλετο</span>.
This is quite different from the text of Irenæus, which reads *facturos
hoc quod ipse voluisset* (implying that the original Greek was <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.ix-p52.2"></span>ποιήσοντας τοῦτο ὅπερ
ἠβούλετο</span>), “to carry out what he \[viz. Ptolemy\] had desired.”
Heinichen modifies the text of Eusebius somewhat, substituting <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.ix-p52.3"></span>ποιήσοντας τὰ</span> for
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.ix-p52.4"></span>ποιήσαντος
τοῦ</span>, but there can be little doubt that Eusebius originally wrote
the sentence in the form given at the beginning of this note. That
Irenæus wrote it in that form, however, is uncertain, though, in view of
the fact that Clement of Alex. (*Strom.* I. 22) confirms the reading of
Eusebius (reading <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p52.5"></span>θεοῦ γὰρ ἦν βούλημα</span>), I am inclined to
think that the text of Eusebius represents the original more closely
than the text of the Latin translation of Irenæus does. Most of the
editors, however, both of Eusebius and of Irenæus, take the other view
(cf. Harvey’s note in his edition of Irenæus, Vol. II. p. 113).

<span id="iii.x.ix-p54"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p54.1"></span>τὴν αὐτὴν ἑρμήνειαν γρ€φειν</span>, as the
majority of the <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p54.2"></span>mss.</span>, followed by Burton and most
other editors, read. Stroth Zimmermann, and Heinichen, on the authority
of Rufinus and of the Latin version of Irenæus, read, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.ix-p54.3"></span>τὴν αὐτὴν ἑρμηνεύειν
γραφήν</span>.

<span id="fn_1498"></span>[224:1499](2010149.htm#fr_1498) <span
id="iii.x.ix-p55.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p56"></span> <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="fn_1499"></span>[224:1500](2010149.htm#fr_1499) <span
id="iii.x.ix-p57.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.ix-p58"></span> This tradition, which was commonly
accepted until the time of the Reformation, dates from the first
Christian century, for it is found in the fourth book of Ezra (xiv. 44):
It is there said that Ezra was inspired to dictate to five men, during
forty days, ninety-four books, of which twenty-four (the canonical
books) were to be published. The tradition is repeated quite frequently
by the Fathers, but that Ezra formed the Old Testament canon is
impossible, for some of the books were not written until after his day.
The truth is, it was a gradual growth and was not completed until the
second century <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.ix-p58.1"></span>b.c.</span> See above, Bk. III. chap. 10,
note 1.
