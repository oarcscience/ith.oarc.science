<span id="iv.vi.iv.lvi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter LVI</span>.—*How he took Bishops
with him on an Expedition against the Persians, and took with him a Tent
in the Form of a Church.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lvi-p2.1"></span>It</span> is also worthy of record that
about the time of which I am at present writing, the emperor, having
heard of an insurrection of some barbarians in the East, observed that
the conquest of this enemy was still in store for him, and resolved on
an expedition against the Persians. Accordingly he proceeded at once to
put his forces in motion, at the same time communicating his intended
march to the bishops who happened to be at his court, some of whom he
judged it right to take with him as compan<span id="page_555">p.
555</span> <span id="iv.vi.iv.lvi-Page_555"></span>ions, and as needful
coadjutors in the service of God. They, on the other hand, cheerfully
declared their willingness to follow in his train, disclaiming any
desire to leave him, and engaging to battle with and for him by
supplication to God on his behalf. Full of joy at this answer to his
request, he unfolded to them his projected line of march; <span

great splendor, representing in shape the figure of a church, to be
prepared for his own use in the approaching war. In this he intended to
unite with the bishops in offering prayers to the God from whom all
victory proceeds.
