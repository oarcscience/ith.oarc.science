<span id="iii.vii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—</span>*The Martyrdom of James
the Apostle.*

<span id="iii.vii.x-p2"></span>1. “ <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329) <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.x-p3.3"></span>Now</span> about that time” (it is clear that
he means the time of Claudius) “Herod the King <span
id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330) stretched forth his hands to vex
certain of the Church. And he killed James the brother of John with the
sword.”

<span id="iii.vii.x-p5"></span>2. And concerning this James, Clement, in
the seventh book of his Hypotyposes, <span
id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331) relates a story <span id="page_111">p.
111</span> <span id="iii.vii.x-Page_111"></span>which is worthy of
mention; telling it as he received it from those who had lived before
him. He says that the one who led James to the judgment-seat, when he
saw him bearing his testimony, was moved, and confessed that he was
himself also a Christian.

<span id="iii.vii.x-p7"></span>3. They were both therefore, he says, led
away together; and on the way he begged James to forgive him. And he,
after considering a little, said, “Peace be with thee,” and kissed him.
And thus they were both beheaded at the same time.

<span id="iii.vii.x-p8"></span>4. And then, as the divine Scripture
says, <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332) Herod, upon the death of
James, seeing that the deed pleased the Jews, attacked Peter also and
committed him to prison, and would have slain him if he had not, by the
divine appearance of an angel who came to him by night, been wonderfully
released from his bonds, and thus liberated for the service of the
Gospel. Such was the providence of God in respect to Peter.

<span id="iii.vii.x-p6"></span> On Clement’s *Hypotyposes,* see below,
Bk. VI. chap. 13, note 3. This fragment is preserved by Eusebius alone.
The account was probably received by Clement from oral tradition. He had
a great store of such traditions of the apostles and their immediate
followers,—in how far true or false it is impossible to say; compare the
story which he tells of John, quoted by Eusebius, Bk. III. chap. 23,
below. This story of James is not intrinsically improbable. It may have
been true, though external testimony for it is, of course, weak. The
Latin legends concerning James’ later labors in Spain and his burial in
Compostella are entirely worthless. Epiphanius reports that he was
unmarried, and lived the life of a Nazarite; but he gives no authority
for his statement and it is not improbable that the report originated
through a confusion of this James with James the Just.
