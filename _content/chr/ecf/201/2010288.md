Statue at Antioch.*

<span id="iii.xv.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xv.iii-p2.1"></span>After</span> this man had carried on all
kinds of war against us and had caused our people to be diligently
hunted up in their retreats, as if they were unholy thieves, and had
devised every sort of slander and accusation against us, and become the
cause of death to vast numbers, he finally erected a statue of Jupiter
Philius <span id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724) with certain
juggleries and magic rites. And after inventing unholy forms of
initiation and ill-omened mysteries in connection with it, and
abominable means of purification, <span
id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725) he exhibited his jugglery, by
oracles which he pretended to utter, even to the emperor; and through a
flattery which was pleasing to the ruler he aroused the demon against
the Christians and said that the god had given command to expel the
Christians as his enemies beyond the confines of the city and the
neighboring districts.

<span id="iii.xv.iii-p3"></span> Jupiter Philius, the god of friendship
or good-will, was widely honored in the East. He seems to have been the
tutelary divinity of Antioch, and, according to Valesius, a temple of
his at Antioch is mentioned by the emperor Julian and by Libanius.

<span id="iii.xv.iii-p4"></span> “The ceremonies of the Gentiles, used
in the erection and consecration of images to their gods, were various.
Jupiter Ctesius was consecrated with one sort of rites, Herceus with
another, and Philius with a third sort” (Valesius). For farther
particulars, see his note *ad locum.*
