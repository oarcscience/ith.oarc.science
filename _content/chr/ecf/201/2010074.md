<span id="iii.viii.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—</span>*The Last Siege of the
Jews after Christ.*

<span id="iii.viii.v-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.v-p2.1"></span>After</span> Nero had held the power
thirteen years, <span id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621) and Galba and
Otho had ruled a year and six months, <span
id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622) Vespasian, who had become
distinguished in the campaigns against the Jews, was proclaimed
sovereign in Judea and received the title of Emperor from the armies
there. <span id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623) Setting out immediately,
therefore, for Rome, he entrusted the conduct of the war against the
Jews to his son Titus. <span id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624)

<span id="iii.viii.v-p7"></span>2. For the Jews after the ascension of
our Saviour, in addition to their crime against him, had been devising
as many plots as they could against his apostles. First Stephen was
stoned to death by them, <span id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625) and
after him James, the son of Zebedee and the brother of John, was
beheaded, <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626) and finally James, the
first that had obtained the episcopal seat in Jerusalem after the
ascension of our Saviour, died in the manner already described. <span
id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627) But the rest of the apostles, who had
been incessantly plotted against with a view to their destruction, and
had been driven out of the land of Judea, went unto all nations to
preach the Gospel, <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628) relying upon
the power of Christ, who had said to them, “Go ye and make disciples of
all the nations in my name.” <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629)

<span id="iii.viii.v-p13"></span>3. But the people of the church in
Jerusalem had been commanded by a revelation, vouchsafed to approved men
there before the war, to leave the city and to dwell in a certain town
of Perea called Pella. <span id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630) And when
those that believed in Christ had come thither from Jerusalem, then, as
if the royal city of the Jews and the whole land of Judea were entirely
destitute of holy men, the judgment of God at length overtook those who
had committed such outrages against Christ and his apostles, and totally
destroyed that generation of impious men.

<span id="iii.viii.v-p15"></span>4. But the number of calamities which
everywhere fell upon the nation at that time; the extreme misfortunes to
which the inhabitants of Judea were especially subjected, the thousands
of men, as well as women and children, that perished by the sword, by
famine, and by other forms of death innumerable,—all these things, as
well as the many great sieges which were carried on against the cities
of Judea, and the excessive. sufferings endured by those that fled to
Jerusalem itself, as to a city of perfect safety, and finally the
general course of the whole war, as well as its particular occurrences
in detail, and how at last the abomination of desolation, proclaimed by
the prophets, <span id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631) stood in the very
temple of God, so celebrated of old, the temple which was now awaiting
its total and final destruction by fire,—all these things any one that
wishes may find accurately described in the history written by
Josephus. <span id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632)

<span id="iii.viii.v-p18"></span>5. But it is necessary to state that
this writer records that the multitude of those who were assembled from
all Judea at the time of the Passover, to the number of three million
souls, <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633) were shut up in Jerusalem
“as in a prison,” to use his own words.

<span id="iii.viii.v-p20"></span>6. For it was right that in the very
days in which they had inflicted suffering upon the Saviour and the
Benefactor of all, the Christ of God, that in those days, shut up “as in
a prison,” they should meet with destruction at the hands of divine
justice.

<span id="iii.viii.v-p21"></span>7. But passing by the particular
calamities which they suffered from the attempts made upon them by the
sword and by other means, I think it necessary to relate only the
misfortunes which the famine caused, that those who read <span
id="page_139">p. 139</span> <span id="iii.viii.v-Page_139"></span>this
work may have some means of knowing that God was not long in executing
vengeance upon them for their wickedness against the Christ of God.

<span id="iii.viii.v-p3"></span> Nero was emperor from Oct. 16, 54, to
June 9, 68 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.v-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="fn_622"></span>[138:623](2010074.htm#fr_622) <span
id="iii.viii.v-p3.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.v-p4"></span> Eusebius figures are incorrect. He
omits Vitellius entirely, while he stretches Galba’s and Otho’s reigns
to make them cover a period of eighteen months, instead of nine (Galba
reigned from June 9, 68, to Jan. 15, 69; and Otho from Jan. 15 to April
20, 69). The total of the three reigns of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius was
about eighteen months.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[138:624](2010074.htm#fr_623) <span
id="iii.viii.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.v-p5"></span> Vespasian was proclaimed emperor by the
prefect of Egypt at Alexandria, July 1, 69, while Vitellius was the
acknowledged emperor in Italy. His choice was immediately ratified by
his army in Judea, and then by all the legions in the East. Vitellius
was conquered by Vespasian’s generals, and slain in Italy, Dec. 20, 69,
while Vespasian himself went to Alexandria. The latter was immediately
recognized by the Senate, and reached Italy in the summer of 70.
Eusebius is thus approximately correct, though he is not exact as to
details.

<span id="iii.viii.v-p14"></span> Pella was a town situated beyond the
Jordan, in the north of Perea, within the dominions of Herod Agrippa II.
The surrounding population was chiefly Gentile. See Pliny V. 18, and
Josephus, *B. J.* III. 3. 3, and I. 4. 8. Epiphanius (*De pond. et
mens.* 15) also records this flight of the Christians to Pella.

id="iii.viii.v-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.v-p19"></span> *B. J.*VI. 9, §§3 and 4. Eusebius
simply gives round numbers. Josephus in §3 puts the number at 2,700,000,
exclusive of the “unclean and the strangers” who were not allowed to eat
the Passover. In the same work, Bk. II. chap. 14, §3, Josephus states
that when Cestius Gallus, governor of Syria, came to Jerusalem at the
time of the Passover in 65 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.v-p19.1"></span>a.d.</span>, no less than 3,000,000 persons
came about him to enter complaint against the procurator Florus. These
numbers are grossly exaggerated. Tacitus estimates the number in the
city at the time of the siege as 600,000, but this, too, is far above
the truth. The writer of the article *Jerusalem,* in Smith’s *Bible
Dict.,* estimates that the city can never have had a population of more
than 50,000 souls, and he concludes that at the time of the siege there
cannot have been more than 60,000 or 70,000 collected within the walls.
This is probably too low an estimate, but shows how far out of the way
the figures of Josephus and Tacitus must be.
