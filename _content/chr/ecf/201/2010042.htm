<p class="c18"><a name="iii.vii.i-p3"></A>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.i-p3.1"></A>We</span> have discussed in the preceding book those subjects in ecclesiastical history which it was necessary to treat by way of introduction, and have accompanied them with brief proofs. Such were the divinity of the saving Word, and the antiquity of the doctrines which we teach, as well as of that evangelical life which is led by Christians, together with the events which have taken place in connection with Christ&#146;s recent appearance, and in connection with his passion and with the choice of the apostles.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vii.i-p4"></A>2. In the present book let us examine the events which took place after his ascension, confirming some of them from the divine Scriptures, and others from such writings as we shall refer to from time to time.</p>
