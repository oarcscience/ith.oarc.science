Embassy from the Persians and kept the Night Vigil with others at the
Feast of Easter.*

hearing of the emperor’s warlike preparations, and not a little
terrified at the prospect of an engagement with his forces, dispatched
an embassy to pray for conditions of peace. These overtures the emperor,
himself a sincere lover of peace, at once accepted, and readily entered
on friendly relations with that people. At this time, the great festival
of Easter was at hand; on which occasion he rendered the tribute of his
prayers to God, and passed the night in watching with the rest.
