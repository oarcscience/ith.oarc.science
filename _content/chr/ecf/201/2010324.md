<span id="iii.xvii.xvii-p1"></span> On Bk. VI. chap. 12, § 6.

<span id="iii.xvii.xvii-p2"></span>Since this passage was printed, I
have seen Westcott’s translation of this fragment of Serapion’s epistle
in his *Canon of the New Testament*, 5th ed. p. 390 sq. (cf. especially
p. 391, note), and am glad to note that his rendering of the words <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xvii.xvii-p2.1"></span>καταρξαμένων
αὐτοῦ</span> is the same as my own. His interpretation of one or two
other points I am unable to adopt.
