<span id="iv.vi.i.liv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.liv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LIV</span>.—*That those who refuse
to sacrifice are to be dismissed from Military Service, and those in
Prison not to be fed.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.liv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.liv-p2.1"></span>Failing</span>, however, to obtain
obedience in this respect also, at length he threw off the mask, and
gave orders that those who held military commissions in the several
cities of the empire should be deprived of their respective commands, in
case of their refusal to offer sacrifices to the demons. Accordingly the
forces of the authorities in every province suffered the loss of those
who worshiped God; and he too who had decreed this order suffered loss,
in that he thus deprived himself of the prayers of pious men. And why
should I still further mention how he directed that no one should obey
the dictates of common humanity by distributing food to those who were
pining in prisons, or should even pity the captives who perished with
hunger; in short, that no one should perform a virtuous action, and that
those whose natural feelings impelled them to sympathize with their
fellow-creatures should be prohibited from doing them a single kindness?
Truly this was the most utterly shameless and scandalous of all laws,
and one which surpassed the worst depravity of human nature: a law which
inflicted on those who showed mercy the same penalties as on those who
were the objects of their compassion, and visited the exercise of mere
humanity with the severest punishments. <span
