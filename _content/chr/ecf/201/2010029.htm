<p class="c47"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p1"></A>  <span class="c11"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p1.1"></A>Chapter</span> II.&#8212;<i>Summary View of the Pre-existence and Divinity of Our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p2"></A>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p2.1"></A>Since</span> in Christ there is a twofold nature, and the one&#8212;in so far as he is thought of as God&#8212;resembles the head of the body, while the other may be compared with the feet,&#8212;in so far as he, for the sake of our salvation, put on human nature with the same passions as our own,&#8212;the following work will be complete only if we begin with the chief and lordliest events of all his history. In this way will the antiquity and divinity of Christianity be shown to those who suppose it of recent and foreign origin,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A>
 and imagine that it appeared only yesterday.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p5"></A>2. No language is sufficient to express the origin and the worth, the being and the nature of Christ. Wherefore also the divine Spirit says in the prophecies, &#8220;Who shall declare his generation?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A>
 For none knoweth the Father except the Son, neither can any one know the Son adequately except the Father alone who hath begotten him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p8"></A>3. For who beside the Father could clearly understand the Light which was before the world, the intellectual and essential Wisdom which existed before the ages, the living Word which was in the beginning with the Father and which was God, the first and only begotten of God which was before every creature and creation visible and invisible, the commander-in-chief of the rational and immortal host of heaven, the messenger of the great counsel, the executor of the Father&#146;s unspoken will, the creator, with the Father, of all things, the second cause of the universe after the Father, the true and only-begotten Son of God, the Lord and God and King of all created things, the one who has received dominion and power, with divinity itself, and with might and honor from the Father; as it is said in regard to him in the mystical passages of Scripture which speak of his divinity: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>
 &#8220;All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p11"></A>4. This, too, the great Moses teaches, when, as the most ancient of all the prophets, he describes under the influence of the divine Spirit the creation and arrangement of the universe. He declares that the maker of the world and the creator of all things yielded to Christ himself, and to none other than his own clearly divine and first-born Word, the making of inferior things, and communed with him respecting the creation of man. &#8220;For,&#8221; says he, &#8220;God said, Let us make man in our image and in our likeness.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p13"></A>5. And another of the prophets confirms this, speaking of God in his hymns as follows: &#8220;He spake and they were made; he commanded and they were created.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A>
 He here introduces the Father and Maker as Ruler of all, commanding with a kingly nod, and second to him the divine Word, none other than the one who is proclaimed by us, as carrying out <A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.ii-Page_83"></A>the Father&#146;s commands.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p15"></A>6. All that are said to have excelled in righteousness and piety since the creation of man, the great servant Moses and before him in the first place Abraham and his children, and as many righteous men and prophets as afterward appeared, have contemplated him with the pure eyes of the mind, and have recognized him and offered to him the worship which is due him as Son of God.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p16"></A>7. But he, by no means neglectful of the reverence due to the Father, was appointed to teach the knowledge of the Father to them all. For instance, the Lord God, it is said, appeared as a common man to Abraham while he was sitting at the oak of Mambre.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A>
 And he, immediately falling down, although he saw a man with his eyes, nevertheless worshiped him as God, and sacrificed to him as Lord, and confessed that he was not ignorant of his identity when he uttered the words, &#8220;Lord, the judge of all the earth, wilt thou not execute righteous judgment?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p19"></A>8. For if it is unreasonable to suppose that the unbegotten and immutable essence of the almighty God was changed into the form of man or that it deceived the eyes of the beholders with the appearance of some created thing, and if it is unreasonable to suppose, on the other hand, that the Scripture should falsely invent such things, when the God and Lord who judgeth all the earth and executeth judgment is seen in the form of a man, who else can be called, if it be not lawful to call him the first cause of all things, than his only pre-existent Word?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A>
 Concerning whom it is said in the Psalms, &#8220;He sent his Word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p22"></A>9. Moses most clearly proclaims him second Lord after the Father, when he says, &#8220;The Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A>
 The divine Scripture also calls him God, when he appeared again to Jacob in the form of a man, and said to Jacob, &#8220;Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name, because thou hast prevailed with God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A>
 Wherefore also Jacob called the name of that place &#8220;Vision of God,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A>
 saying, &#8220;For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p27"></A>10. Nor is it admissible to suppose that the theophanies recorded were appearances of subordinate angels and ministers of God, for whenever any of these appeared to men, the Scripture does not conceal the fact, but calls them by name not God nor Lord, but angels, as it is easy to prove by numberless testimonies.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p28"></A>11. Joshua, also, the successor of Moses, calls him, as leader of the heavenly angels and archangels and of the supramundane powers, and as lieutenant of the Father,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A>
 entrusted with the second rank of sovereignty and rule over all, &#8220;captain of the host of the Lord,&#8221; although he saw him not otherwise than again in the form and appearance of a man. For it is written:</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p30"></A>12. &#8220;And it came to pass when Joshua was at Jericho&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A>
 that he looked and saw a man standing over against him with his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went unto him and said, Art thou for us or for our adversaries? And he said unto him, As captain of the host of the Lord am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and said unto him, Lord, what dost thou command thy servant? and the captain of the Lord said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p33"></A>13. You will perceive also from the same words that this was no other than he who talked with Moses.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A>
 For the Scripture says in the same words and with reference to the same one, &#8220;When the Lord saw that he drew near to see, the Lord called to him out of the bush and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, What is it? And he said, Draw not nigh hither; loose thy shoe from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. And he said unto him, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p36"></A>14. And that there is a certain substance which lived and subsisted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A>
 before the world, and which ministered unto the Father and God of the universe for the formation of all created things, and which is called the Word of God and Wisdom, we may learn, to quote other proofs in addition to those already cited, from the mouth of Wisdom herself, who reveals most clearly through Solomon the following mysteries concerning herself: &#8220;I, Wisdom, have dwelt <A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.ii-Page_84"></A>with prudence and knowledge, and I have invoked understanding. Through me kings reign, and princes ordain righteousness. Through me the great are magnified, and through me sovereigns rule the earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p39"></A>15. To which she adds: &#8220;The Lord created me in the beginning of his ways, for his works; before the world he established me, in the beginning, before he made the earth, before he made the depths, before the mountains were settled, before all hills he begat me. When he prepared the heavens I was present with him, and when he established the fountains of the region under heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A>
 I was with him, disposing. I was the one in whom he delighted; daily I rejoiced before him at all times when he was rejoicing at having completed the world.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p42"></A>16. That the divine Word, therefore, pre-existed and appeared to some, if not to all, has thus been briefly shown by us.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p43"></A>17. But why the Gospel was not preached in ancient times to all men and to all nations, as it is now, will appear from the following considerations.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A>
 The life of the ancients was not of such a kind as to permit them to receive the all-wise and all-virtuous teaching of Christ.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p45"></A>18. For immediately in the beginning, after his original life of blessedness, the first man despised the command of God, and fell into this mortal and perishable state, and exchanged his former divinely inspired luxury for this curse-laden earth. His descendants having filled our earth, showed themselves much worse, with the exception of one here and there, and entered upon a certain brutal and insupportable mode of life.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p46"></A>19. They thought neither of city nor state, neither of arts nor sciences. They were ignorant even of the name of laws and of justice, of virtue and of philosophy. As nomads, they passed their lives in deserts, like wild and fierce beasts, destroying, by an excess of voluntary wickedness, the natural reason of man, and the seeds of thought and of culture implanted in the human soul. They gave themselves wholly over to all kinds of profanity, now seducing one another, now slaying one another, now eating human flesh, and now daring to wage war with the Gods and to undertake those battles of the giants celebrated by all; now planning to fortify earth against heaven, and in the madness of ungoverned pride to prepare an attack upon the very God of all.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p48"></A>20. On account of these things, when they conducted themselves thus, the all-seeing God sent down upon them floods and conflagrations as upon a wild forest spread over the whole earth. He cut them down with continuous famines and plagues, with wars, and with thunderbolts from heaven, as if to check some terrible and obstinate disease of souls with more severe punishments.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p49"></A>21. Then, when the excess of wickedness had overwhelmed nearly all the race, like a deep fit of drunkenness, beclouding and darkening the minds of men, the first-born and first-created wisdom of God, the pre-existent Word himself, induced by his exceeding love for man, appeared to his servants, now in the form of angels, and again to one and another of those ancients who enjoyed the favor of God, in his own person as the saving power of God, not otherwise, however, than in the shape of man, because it was impossible to appear in any other way.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p50"></A>22. And as by them the seeds of piety were sown among a multitude of men and the whole nation, descended from the Hebrews, devoted themselves persistently to the worship of God, he imparted to them through the prophet Moses, as to multitudes still corrupted by their ancient practices, images and symbols of a certain mystic Sabbath and of circumcision, and elements of other spiritual principles, but he did not grant them a complete knowledge of the mysteries themselves.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p51"></A>23. But when their law became celebrated, and, like a sweet odor, was diffused among all men, as a result of their influence the dispositions of the majority of the heathen were softened by the lawgivers and philosophers who arose on every side, and their wild and savage brutality was changed into mildness, so that they enjoyed deep peace, friendship, and social intercourse.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A>
 Then, finally, at the time of the origin of the Roman Empire, there appeared again to all men and nations throughout the world, who had been, as it were, previously assisted, and were now fitted to receive the knowledge of the Father, that same teacher <A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A> <a name="iii.vi.ii-Page_85"></A>of virtue, the minister of the Father in all good things, the divine and heavenly Word of God, in a human body not at all differing in substance from our own. He did and suffered the things which had been prophesied. For it had been foretold that one who was at the same time man and God should come and dwell in the world, should perform wonderful works, and should show himself a teacher to all nations of the piety of the Father. The marvelous nature of his birth, and his new teaching, and his wonderful works had also been foretold; so likewise the manner of his death, his resurrection from the dead, and, finally, his divine ascension into heaven.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p53"></A>24. For instance, Daniel the prophet, under the influence of the divine Spirit, seeing his kingdom at the end of time,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A>
 was inspired thus to describe the divine vision in language fitted to human comprehension: &#8220;For I beheld,&#8221; he says, &#8220;until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was a flame of fire and his wheels burning fire. A river of fire flowed before him. Thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. He appointed judgment, and the books were opened.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p56"></A>25. And again, &#8220;I saw,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and he hastened unto the Ancient of Days and was brought into his presence, and there was given him the dominion and the glory and the kingdom; and all peoples, tribes, and tongues serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall not be destroyed.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p58"></A>26. It is clear that these words can refer to no one else than to our Saviour, the God Word who was in the beginning with God, and who was called the Son of man because of his final appearance in the flesh.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.vi.ii-p59"></A>27. But since we have collected in separate books&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A>
 the selections from the prophets which relate to our Saviour Jesus Christ, and have arranged in a more logical form those things which have been revealed concerning him, what has been said will suffice for the present.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p4"></A> This was one of the principal objections raised against Christianity. Antiquity was considered a prime requisite in a religion which claimed to be true, and no reproach was greater than the reproach of novelty. Hence the apologists laid great stress upon the antiquity of Christianity, and this was one reason why they appropriated the Old Testament as a Christian book. Compare, for instance, the apologies of Justin Martyr, Tatian, Athenagoras, Theophilus, Tertullian and Minucius Felix, and the works of Clement of Alexandria. See Engelhardt&#146;s article on Eusebius, in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die hist. Theologie</i>, 1852, p. 652 sq.; Schaff&#146;s <i>Church History</i>, Vol. II. p. 110; and Tzschirner&#146;s <i>Geschichte der Apologetik</i>, p. 99 sq.</p>

There is really nothing in this passage to imply that the Psalmist thinks, as Eusebius supposes, of the Son as the Father&#146;s agent in creation, who is here addressed by the Father. As Stroth remarks, &#8220;According to Eusebius, &#145;He spake&#146; is equivalent to &#145;He said to the Son, Create&#146;; and &#145;They were created&#146; means, according to him, not &#145;They arose immediately upon this command of God,&#146; but &#145;The Son was immediately obedient to the command of the Father and produced them.&#146; For Eusebius connects this verse with the sixth, &#145;By the <i>word</i> of the Lord were the heavens made,&#146; where he understands Christ to be referred to. Perhaps this verse has been omitted in the Greek through an oversight, for it is found in Rufinus.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p20"></A> Eusebius accepts the common view of the early Church, that the theophanies of the Old Testament were Christophanies; that is, appearances of the second person of the Trinity. Augustine seems to have been the first of the Fathers to take a different view, maintaining that such Christophanies were not consistent with the identity of essence between Father and Son, and that the Scriptures themselves teach that it was not the Logos, but an angel, that appeared to the Old Testament worthies on various occasions (cf. <i>De Trin.</i> III. 11). Augustine&#146;s opinion was widely adopted, but in modern times the earlier view, which Eusebius represents, has been the prevailing one (see Hodge, <i>Systematic Theology</i>, I. p. 490, and Lange&#146;s article <i>Theophany</i> in Herzog).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p34"></A> Eusebius agrees with other earlier Fathers (e.g. Justin Martyr, Origen, and Cyprian) in identifying the one that appeared to Joshua with him that had appeared to Moses, on the ground that the same words were used in both cases (cf. especially Justin&#146;s <i>Dial. c. Trypho</i>, chap. 62). Many later Fathers (e.g. Theodoret) regard the person that appeared to Joshua as the archangel Michael, who is described by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#021">Dan. 10:21</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001">Dan. 12:1</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p34.1"></A>) as fighting for the people of God.

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p44"></A> Eusebius pursues much the same line of argument in his <i>Dem. Evang</i>., Pr&#339;m. Bk. VIII.; and compare also Gregory of Nyssa&#146;s Third Oration on the birth of the Lord (at the beginning). The objection which Eusebius undertakes to answer here was an old one, and had been considered by Justin Martyr, by Origen in his work against Celsus, and by others (see Tzschirner&#146;s <i>Geschichte der Apologetik,</i> p. 25 ff.).</p>
<A NAME="fn_46"></A><A HREF="2010029.htm#fr_46">84:47</A> <a name="iii.vi.ii-p46.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p47"></A> The reference here seems to be to the building of the tower of Babel (<a name="iii.vi.ii-p47.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#001">Gen. xi. 1-9</a><a name="iii.vi.ii-p47.2"></A>), although Valesius thinks otherwise. The fact that Eusebius refers to the battles of the giants, which were celebrated in heathen song, does not militate against a reference in this passage to the narrative recounted in Genesis. He illustrates the presumption of the human race by instances familiar to his readers whether drawn from Christian or from Pagan sources. Compare the <i>Pr&aelig;p. Evang</i>. ix. 14.</p>
<A NAME="fn_47"></A><A HREF="2010029.htm#fr_47">84:48</A> <a name="iii.vi.ii-p51.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p52"></A> It was the opinion of Eusebius, in common with most of the Fathers, that the Greek philosophers, lawgivers, and poets had obtained their wisdom from the ancient Hebrews, and this point was pressed very strongly by many of the apologists in their effort to prove the antiquity of Christianity. The assertion was made especially in the case of Plato and Pythagoras, who were said to have become acquainted with the books of the Hebrews upon their journey to Egypt. Compare among other passages Justin&#146;s <i>Apol</i>. I. 59 ff.; Clement of Alexandria&#146;s <i>Cohort. ad Gentes</i>, chap. 6; and Tertullian&#146;s <i>Apol.</i> chap. 47. Compare also Eusebius&#146; <i>Pr&aelig;p. Evang.,</i> Bks. IX. and X.</p>
