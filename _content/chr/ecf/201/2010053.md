<span id="iii.vii.xii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI.—</span>*The Impostor Theudas
and his Followers.*

<span id="iii.vii.xii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.xii-p2.1"></span>Luke</span>, in the Acts, introduces
Gamaliel as saying, at the consultation which was held concerning the
apostles, that at the time referred to, <span
id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346) “rose up Theudas boasting himself to
be somebody; who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were
scattered.” <span id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347) Let us therefore add
the account of Josephus concerning this man. He records in the work
mentioned just above, the following circumstances: <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348)

<span id="iii.vii.xii-p6"></span>2. “While Fadus was procurator of
Judea <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349) a certain impostor called
Theudas <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350) persuaded <span
id="page_113">p. 113</span> <span id="iii.vii.xii-Page_113"></span>a
very great multitude to take their possessions and follow him to the
river Jordan. For he said that he was a prophet, and that the river
should be divided at his command, and afford them an easy passage.

<span id="iii.vii.xii-p10"></span>3. And with these words he deceived
many. But Fadus did not permit them to enjoy their folly, but sent a
troop of horsemen against them, who fell upon them unexpectedly and slew
many of them and took many others alive, while they took Theudas himself
captive, and cut off his head and carried it to Jerusalem.” Besides this
he also makes mention of the famine, which took place in the reign of
Claudius, in the following words.

<span id="iii.vii.xii-p8"></span> There is a chronological difficulty in
connection with this Theudas which has caused much dispute. The Theudas
mentioned by Josephus arose in the time of Claudius; but the Theudas
referred to by Gamaliel in the Acts must have lived many years before
that. Various solutions of greater or less plausibility have been
offered, almost any one of which is possible, and abundantly sufficient
to account for the alleged discrepancy, though none can be proved to be
true. Compare Wieseler’s *Chron. des ap. Zeitalters,* p. 138, note 1;
Ewald’s *Gesch. des Jüdischen Volkes,* Bd. VI. p. 532; Jost’s *Gesch.
der Israeliten,* Bd. II. Anhang, p. 86; and the various commentaries on
the Acts *in loco.*

<span id="iii.vii.xii-p9"></span>A question of more importance for us,
in the present instance, is as to Eusebius’ conduct in the case. He
identifies the Theudas of Luke with the Theudas of Josephus,—an
identification which is impossible, if both accounts are accepted as
trustworthy. Eusebius has consequently been accused of an intentional
perversion of facts for the sake of promoting the credibility of Luke’s
accounts. But a protest must again be entered against such grave
imputations upon the honesty of Eusebius. A man with a very small
allowance of common sense would certainly not have been so foolish as
consciously to involve himself in such a glaring anachronism—an
anachronism which every reader had the means of exposing—for the sake of
making a point in confirmation of the narrative of Luke. Had he been
conscious of the discrepancy, he would certainly have endeavored to
reconcile the two accounts, and it would not have required a great
amount of ingenuity or research to discover in the pages of Josephus
himself a sufficiently plausible reconciliation. The only reasonable
explanation of Eusebius’ anachronism is his carelessness, which caused
him to fall into many blunders as bad as the present, especially in
questions of chronology. He read, in the Acts, of Theudas; he read, in
Josephus, of a similar character of the same name; he identified the two
hastily, and without a thought of any chronological difficulty in the
case. He quotes the passage from the Acts very freely, and possibly
without recollecting that it occurs several chapters before the account
of the famine and of the other events which happened in the time of
Claudius.
