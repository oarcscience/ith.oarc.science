<span id="iii.x.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.—</span>*Serapion on the Heresy of
the Phrygians.*

<span id="iii.x.xx-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p2.1"></span>Serapion</span>, <span
id="fr_1650"></span>[1651](#fn_1650) who, as report says, succeeded
Maximinus <span id="fr_1651"></span>[1652](#fn_1651) at that time as
bishop of the church of Antioch, mentions the works of Apolinarius <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1653](#fn_1652) against the above-mentioned heresy.
And he alludes to him in a private letter to Caricus and Pontius, <span
id="fr_1653"></span>[1654](#fn_1653) in which he himself exposes the
same heresy, and adds the following words: <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[1655](#fn_1654)

<span id="iii.x.xx-p8"></span>2. “That you may see that the doings of
this lying band of the new prophecy, so called, are an abomination to
all the brotherhood throughout the world, I have sent you writings <span
id="fr_1655"></span>[1656](#fn_1655) of the most blessed Claudius
Apolinarius, bishop of Hierapolis in Asia.”

<span id="iii.x.xx-p10"></span>3. In the same letter of Serapion the
signatures of several bishops are found, <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[1657](#fn_1656) one of whom subscribes himself as
follows:

<span id="iii.x.xx-p12"></span>“I, Aurelius Cyrenius, a witness, <span
id="fr_1657"></span>[1658](#fn_1657) pray for your health.”

<span id="iii.x.xx-p14"></span>And another in this manner:

<span id="iii.x.xx-p15"></span>“Ælius Publius Julius, <span
id="fr_1658"></span>[1659](#fn_1658) bishop of Debeltum, a colony of
Thrace. As God liveth in the heavens, the blessed Sotas in Anchialus
desired to cast the demon out of Priscilla, but the hypocrites did not
permit him.” <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1660](#fn_1659)

<span id="iii.x.xx-p18"></span>4. And the autograph signatures of many
other bishops who agreed with them are contained in the same letter.

<span id="iii.x.xx-p19"></span>So much for these persons.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1650"></span>[237:1651](2010160.htm#fr_1650) <span
id="iii.x.xx-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xx-p3"></span> Both versions of the *Chron.* agree in
putting the accession of Serapion into the eleventh year of Commodus
(190 <span class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xx-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>), and
that of his successor Asclepiades into the first year of Caracalla,
which would give Serapion an episcopate of twenty-one years (Syncellus
says twenty-five years, although giving the same dates of accession for
both bishops that the other versions give). Serapion was a well-known
person, and it is not too much to think that the dates given by the
*Chron.* in connection with him may be more reliable than most of its
dates. The truth is, that from the present chapter we learn that he was
already bishop before the end of Commodus’ reign, i.e. before the end of
192 <span class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xx-p3.2"></span>a.d.</span> Were
the statement of Eutychius,—that Demetrius of Alexandria wrote at the
same time to Maximus of Antioch and Victor of Rome,—to be relied upon,
we could fix his accession between 189 and 192 (see Harnack’s *Zeit des
Ignatius,* p. 45). But the truth is little weight can be attached to his
report. While we cannot therefore reach certainty in the matter, there
is no reason for doubting the approximate accuracy of the date given by
the *Chron.* As to the time of his death, we can fix the date of
Asclepiades’ accession approximately in the year 211 (see Bk. VI. chap.
II, note 6), and from the fragment of Alexander’s epistle to the
Antiochenes, quoted in that chapter, it seems probable that there had
been a vacancy in the see of Antioch for some time. But from the mention
of Serapion’s epistles to Domninus (Bk. VI. chap. 12) we may gather that
he lived until after the great persecution of Severus (<span
class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xx-p3.3"></span>a.d.</span> 202 sq.). From
Bk. VI. chap. 12, we learn that Serapion was quite a writer; and he is
commemorated also by Jerome (*de vir. ill.* c. 41) and by Socrates (*H.
E.* III. 7). In addition to the epistle quoted here, he addressed to
Domninus, according to Bk. VI. chap. 12, a treatise (Jerome, *ad
Domninum*…*volumen composuit*), or epistle (the Greek of Eusebius reads
simply <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xx-p3.4"></span>τὰ</span>,
but uses the same article to describe the epistle or epistles to Caricus
and Pontius, so that the nature of the writing is uncertain), as well as
some other epistles, and a work on the Gospel of Peter. These were the
only writings of his which Eusebius had seen, but he reports that there
were probably other works extant. There are preserved to us only the two
fragments quoted by Eusebius in these two chapters. Serapion also played
a prominent rôle in the tradition of the Edessene church, as we learn
from Zahn’s *Doctrina Addai* (*Gött. Gel. Anz.* 1877, St. 6, p. 173,
179, according to Harnack’s *Zeit des Ignatius,* p. 46 sqq.).

this passage by most of the <span class="c13"><span

the best of them, by Nicephorus, Jerome, and Eusebius himself in Bk. VI.
chap. 12, which authorities are followed by Stroth, Burton, Schwegler,
and Heinichen) are called in Bk. VI. chap. 12, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p6.2"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p6.3"></span>κκλησιαστικοὺς ἀνδρὰς</span>. They are
otherwise unknown personages. In that chapter the plural article <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xx-p6.4"></span>τ€</span> is used of the
writing, or writings, addressed to Caricus and Pontius, implying that
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xx-p6.5"></span>ὑ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xx-p6.6"></span>πομνήματα</span> is to be
supplied. This seems to imply more than one writing, but it is not
necessary to conclude that more than the single epistle mentioned here
is meant, for the plural <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p6.7"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p6.8"></span>πομνήματα</span> was often used in a sort of
collective sense to signify a collection of notes, memoranda, &c.

<span id="iii.x.xx-p7"></span> This fragment is given by Routh, *Rel.

id="iii.x.xx-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xx-p11"></span> Valesius justly remarks that Eusebius
does not say that these bishops signed Serapion’s epistle, but only that
their signatures or notes (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p11.1"></span>ὑ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p11.2"></span>ποσημειώσεις</span>) were contained in the
epistle. He thinks it is by no means probable that a bishop of Thrace
(the nationality of the other bishops we do not know) should have signed
this epistle of Serapion’s, and he therefore concludes that Serapion
simply copies from another epistle sent originally from Thrace. This is
possible; but at the end of the chapter Eusebius says that other bishops
put in their signatures or notes with their own hands (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xx-p11.3"></span>αὐτόγραφοι
σημειώσεις</span>), which precludes the idea that Serapion simply copies
their testimony from another source, and if they signed thus it is
possible that the Thracian bishop did likewise. It may be that Serapion
took pains to compose a semi-official communication which should have
the endorsement of as many anti-Montanistic bishops as possible, and
that, in order to secure their signatures he sent it about from one to
the other before forwarding it to Caricus and Pontius.

<span id="fn_1657"></span>[237:1658](2010160.htm#fr_1657) <span
id="iii.x.xx-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xx-p13"></span> Of this Aurelius Cyrenius we know
nothing. It is possible that he means to call himself simply a witness
(<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xx-p13.1"></span>μαρτύς</span>) to
the facts recorded by Serapion in his epistle, but more probable that he
uses the word to indicate that he has “witnessed for Christ” under
persecution.

<span id="fn_1658"></span>[237:1659](2010160.htm#fr_1658) <span
id="iii.x.xx-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xx-p16"></span> Ælius Publius Julius is also an
otherwise unknown personage. Debeltum and Anchialus were towns of
Thrace, on the western shore of the Black Sea.

<span id="fn_1659"></span>[237:1660](2010160.htm#fr_1659) <span
id="iii.x.xx-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xx-p17"></span> Lightfoot (*Ignatius,* II. 111) suggests
that this Sotas (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p17.1"></span>Σωτᾶς</span>) may be identical with the
Zoticus (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p17.2"></span>Ζωτικός</span>) mentioned in the preceding
chapter, the interchange of the initial <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p17.3"></span>Σ</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xx-p17.4"></span>Ζ</span> being very common. But we learn from
chap. 16 that Zoticus was bishop of Comana, so that he can hardly be
identified with Sotas, bishop of Anchialus.
