<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.x.xxvii-p4"></A> <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.x.xxvii-p4.1"></A>&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#8158;&#917;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#962; &#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iii.x.xxvii-p4.2"></A>&#8230;</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iii.x.xxvii-p4.3"></A>&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#956;&#951;&#962;</span>. Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> 35) makes two works out of this: one <i>Against the Gentiles,</i> and another <i>On Knowledge (et contra Gentes volumen breve, et de disciplina aliud).</i> Harvey (I. p. clxvi.) states that one of the Syriac fragments of Iren&aelig;us&#146; works mentions the work of Eusebius <i>On Knowledge,</i> and specifies that it was directed against the Valentinians. In that case it would be necessary to make two separate works, as Jerome does, and so Harvey thinks that the text of Eusebius must be amended by the insertion of an <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.x.xxvii-p4.4"></A>&#7940;</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iii.x.xxvii-p4.5"></A>&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#949;</span>. Unfortunately, Harvey did not name the Syriac fragment which contains the statement referred to, and it is not to be found among those collected in his edition (Venables, in Smith and Wace, states that he could find no such fragment, and I have also searched in vain for it). Evidently some blunder has been committed, and it looks as if Harvey&#146;s statement were unverifiable. Meanwhile, Jerome&#146;s testimony alone is certainly not enough to warrant an emendation of the text in opposition to all the <span class="c13"><a name="iii.x.xxvii-p4.6"></A>mss.</span> and versions. We must therefore conclude, with our present light, that the treatise <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.x.xxvii-p4.7"></A>&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#956;&#951;&#962;</span> was directed against the Greeks, as Eusebius says. The work has entirely perished, with the possible exception of a single brief fragment (the first of the Pfaffian fragments; <i>Gr. Frag.</i> XXXV. in Harvey&#146;s edition), which Harvey refers to it.</p>

This work, too, has perished, though possibly a few of the fragments published by Harvey are to be referred to it (see Harvey, I. p. clxvii.). Harvey conjectures that the work discussed the articles of the early Rule of faith, which is quite possible. Of the &#8220;brother Marcian&#8221; to whom it was addressed, we know nothing.</p>

This work (no longer extant) was probably, as Harvey remarks, &#8220;a collection of sermons and expositions of various texts and passages of Scripture.&#8221; To it are undoubtedly to be referred a great many of the fragments in which passages of Scripture are discussed (see Harvey, I. p. clxvii.).</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.x.xxvii-p8"></A> Commodus was strangled on the 31st of December, 192, and Pertinax, who immediately succeeded him, was murdered, on March 28, 193, by the Pr&aelig;torian guard, which then sold the imperial power to Didius Julianus, who, at the approach of Septimius Severus, who had been proclaimed emperor by the Pannonian legions, was declared a public enemy by the Senate, and beheaded after a reign of only sixty-six days.</p>
