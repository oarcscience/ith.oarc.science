id="iv.vi.ii.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI</span>.—*Those who have
purchased Property belonging to the Church, or received it as a Gift,
are to restore it.*

provision intended to include all cases, to pass over those who have
either procured any such property by right of purchase from the
treasury, or have retained it when conveyed to them in the form of a
gift; let all who have thus rashly indulged their insatiable thirst of
gain be assured that, although by daring to make such purchases they
have done all in their power to alienate our clemency from themselves,
they shall nevertheless not fail of obtaining it, so far as is possible
and consistent with propriety in each case. So much then is determined.
