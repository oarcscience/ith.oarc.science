<span id="iii.vii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—</span>*The Misfortunes which
overwhelmed the Jews after their Presumption against Christ.*

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.vii.vii-p2.1"></span>After</span> the death of Tiberius, Caius
received the empire, and, besides innumerable other acts of tyranny
against many people, he greatly afflicted especially the whole nation of
the Jews. <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309) These things we may
learn briefly from the words of Philo, who writes as follows: <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310)

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p5"></span>2. “So great was the caprice of Caius
in his conduct toward all, and especially toward the nation of the Jews.
The latter he so bitterly hated that he appropriated to himself their
places of worship in the other cities, <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311) and beginning with Alexandria he
filled them with images and statues of himself (for in permitting others
to erect them he really erected them himself). The temple in the holy
city, which had hitherto been left untouched, and had been regarded as
an inviolable asylum, he altered and transformed into a temple of his
own, that it might be called the temple of the visible Jupiter, the
younger Caius.” <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312)

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p8"></span>3. Innumerable other terrible and
almost indescribable calamities which came upon the Jews in Alexandria
during the reign of the same emperor, are recorded by the same author in
a second work, to which he gave the title, *On the Virtues*. <span
id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313) With him agrees also Josephus, who
likewise indicates that the misfortunes of the whole nation began with
the time of Pilate, and with their daring crimes against the
Saviour. <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314)

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p11"></span>4. Hear what he says in the second
book of his Jewish War, where he writes as follows: <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315) “Pilate being sent to Judea as
procurator by Tiberius, secretly carried veiled images of the emperor,
called ensigns, <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316) to Jerusalem by
night. The following day this caused the greatest disturbance among the
Jews. For those who were near were confounded at the sight, beholding
their laws, as it were, trampled under foot. For they allow no image to
be set up in their city.”

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p14"></span>5. Comparing these things with the
writings of the evangelists, you will see that it was not long before
there came upon them the penalty for the exclamation which they had
uttered under the same Pilate, when they cried out that they had no
other king than Cæsar. <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317)

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p16"></span>6. The same writer further records
that after this another calamity overtook them. He writes as
follows: <span id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318) “After this he stirred
up another tumult by making use of the holy treasure, which is called
Corban, <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319) in the construction of
an aqueduct <span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="iii.vii.vii-Page_110"></span>three hundred stadia in length. <span
id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320)

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p20"></span>7. The multitude were greatly
displeased at it, and when Pilate was in Jerusalem they surrounded his
tribunal and gave utterance to loud complaints. But he, anticipating the
tumult, had distributed through the crowd armed soldiers disguised in
citizen’s clothing, forbidding them to use the sword, but commanding
them to strike with clubs those who should make an outcry. To them he
now gave the preconcerted signal from the tribunal. And the Jews being
beaten, many of them perished in consequence of the blows, while many
others were trampled under foot by their own countrymen in their flight,
and thus lost their lives. But the multitude, overawed by the fate of
those who were slain, held their peace.”

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p21"></span>8. In addition to these the same
author records <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321) many other
tumults which were stirred up in Jerusalem itself, and shows that from
that time seditions and wars and mischievous plots followed each other
in quick succession, and never ceased in the city and in all Judea until
finally the siege of Vespasian overwhelmed them. Thus the divine
vengeance overtook the Jews for the crimes which they dared to commit
against Christ.

id="iii.vii.vii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p3"></span> Caius’ hostility to the Jews resulted
chiefly (as mentioned above, chap. 5, note 4) from their refusal to pay
him divine honors, which he demanded from them as well as from his other
subjects. His demands had caused terrible disturbances in Alexandria;
and in Jerusalem, where he commanded the temple to be devoted to his
worship, the tumult was very great and was quieted only by the yielding
of the emperor, who was induced to give up his demands by the request of
Agrippa, who was then at Rome and in high favor with him. Whether the
Jews suffered in the same way in Rome we do not know, but it is probable
that the emperor endeavored to carry out the same plan there as
elsewhere.

the use of the word “other” is not quite clear, though Philo perhaps
means all the cities except Jerusalem, which he mentions a little below.

him from Julius Cæsar who bore the name Caius, and who was also deified”
(Valesius).

id="iii.vii.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p9"></span> This work is probably the same as that
mentioned in the beginning of chap. 5. (See chap. 5, note 1.) The work
seems to have borne two titles <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.vii-p9.1"></span>ἡ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.vii-p9.2"></span>πρεσβεία</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.vii-p9.3"></span>περὶ ἀρετῶν</span>. See
Schürer, *ibid.* p. 859, who considers the <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.vii-p9.4"></span>δευτέρω</span> here the addition of a
copyist, who could not reconcile the two different titles given by
Eusebius.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[109:315](2010048.htm#fr_314) <span
id="iii.vii.vii-p9.5"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p10"></span> This is rather an unwarranted
assumption on the part of Eusebius, as Josephus is very far from
intimating that the calamities of the nation were a consequence of their
crimes against our Saviour.

<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.vii.vii-p18.3"></span>κορβανᾶς</span>.
The word denoted originally any offering to God, especially an offering
in fulfillment of a vow. The form <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.vii.vii-p18.4"></span>κορβανᾶς</span>, which Josephus has
employed here, was used to denote the sacred treasure or the treasury
itself. In [Matt. xxvii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#006)<span
id="iii.vii.vii-p18.5"></span>, the only place where this form of the
word occurs in the New Testament, it is used with the latter meaning.
Upon this act of Pilate’s, see above, chap. 5, note 9.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[110:321](2010048.htm#fr_320) <span
id="iii.vii.vii-p18.6"></span>

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p19"></span> Josephus, in *Ant.* XVIII. 3. 2, says
that the aqueduct was 200 stadia long. In the passage which Eusebius
quotes the number given is 400, according to the Greek <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.vii.vii-p19.1"></span>mss.</span> of Josephus,
though the old Latin translation agrees with Eusebius in reading 300.
The situation of the aqueduct we do not know, though the remains of an
ancient aqueduct have been found to the south of Jerusalem, and it is
thought that this may have been the same. It is possible that Pilate did
not construct a new aqueduct, but simply restored one that had been
built in the time of Solomon. Schultz (*Jerusalem,* Berlin, 1845)
suggests the number 40, supposing that the aqueduct began at Bethlehem,
which is 40 stadia from Jerusalem.

<span id="iii.vii.vii-p22"></span> See *B. J.* II. 10, 12 sqq.
