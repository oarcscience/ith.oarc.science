<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Of the General
Council, at which Bishops from all Nations were Present.* <span
id="fr_3237"></span>[3238](#fn_3237)

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p3.1"></span>In</span> effect, the most distinguished
of God’s ministers from all the churches which abounded in Europe,
Lybia, <span id="fr_3238"></span>[3239](#fn_3238) and Asia were here
assembled. And a single house of prayer, as though divinely enlarged,
sufficed to contain at once Syrians and Cilicians, Phœnicians and
Arabians, delegates from Palestine, and others from Egypt; Thebans and
Libyans, with those who came from the region of Mesopotamia. A Persian
bishop too was present at this conference, nor was even a Scythian found
wanting to the number. <span id="fr_3239"></span>[3240](#fn_3239)
Pontus, Galatia, and Pamphylia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Phrygia, furnished
their most distinguished prelates; while those who dwelt in the remotest
districts of Thrace and Macedonia, of Achaia and Epirus, were
notwithstanding in attendance. Even from Spain itself, one whose fame
was widely spread took his seat as an individual in the great
assembly. <span id="fr_3240"></span>[3241](#fn_3240) The prelate of the
imperial city <span id="fr_3241"></span>[3242](#fn_3241) was prevented
from attending by extreme old age; but his presbyters were present, and
supplied his place. Constantine is the first prince of any age who bound
together such a garland as this with the bond of peace, and presented it
to his Saviour as a thank-offering for the victories he had obtained
over every foe, thus exhibiting in our own times a similitude of the
apostolic company.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p2"></span> The standard work on councils is
Hefele, *Conciliengeschichte,* available to the English reader in the
translation of Clark, Oxenham, &c. (Edinb. 1872 sq.), a work so
thoroughly fundamental that a general reference to it will serve as one
continuous note to matters relating to the councils held under
Constantine.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.vii-p5"></span> It is noted that this evidence of
the presence of foreign bishops—“missionary bishops,” so to speak—is
confirmed by Gelasius and also by the roll of the members.
