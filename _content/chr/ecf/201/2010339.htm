<p class="c18"><a name="iv.ii-p3"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.ii-p3.1"></A>In</span> accordance with the instruction of the editor-in-chief the following work consists of a revision of the Bagster translation of Eusebius&#146; &#8220;Life of Constantine,&#8221; Constantine&#146;s &#8220;Oration to the Saints,&#8221; and Eusebius&#146; &#8220;Oration in Praise of Constantine,&#8221; with somewhat extended Prolegomena and limited notes, especial attention being given in the Prolegomena to a study of the <i>Character</i> of Constantine. In the work of revision care has been taken so far as possible not to destroy the style of the original translator, which though somewhat inflated and verbose, represents perhaps all the better, the corresponding styles of both Eusebius and Constantine, but the number of changes really required has been considerable, and has caused here and there a break in style in the translation, whose chief merit is that it presents in smooth, well-rounded phrase the generalized idea of a sentence. The work on the Prolegomena has been done as thoroughly and originally as circumstances would permit, and has aimed to present material in such way that the general student might get a survey of the man Constantine; and the various problems and discussions of which he is center. It is impossible to return special thanks to all who have given special facilities for work, but the peculiar kindness of various helpers in the <i><span><a name="iv.ii-p3.2"></A>Biblioth&egrave;que de la Ville</span></i> at Lyons demands at least the recognition of individualized thanksgiving.</p>
