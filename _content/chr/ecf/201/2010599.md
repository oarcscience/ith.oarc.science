<span id="iv.vi.iv.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIII</span>.—*He bespeaks his
Affectionate Interest for the Christians in his Country.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xiii-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.xiii-p2.1"></span>Imagine</span>, then, with what joy I
heard tidings so accordant with my desire, that the fairest districts of
Persia are filled with those men on whose behalf alone I am at present
speaking, I <span id="page_544">p. 544</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iv.xiii-Page_544"></span>mean the Christians. I pray,
therefore, that both you and they may enjoy abundant prosperity, and
that your blessings and theirs may be in equal measure; <span
id="fr_3316"></span>[3317](#fn_3316) for thus you will experience the
mercy and favor of that God who is the Lord and Father of all. And now,
because your power is great, I commend these persons to your protection;
because your piety is eminent, I commit them to your care. Cherish them
with your wonted humanity and kindness; for by this proof of faith you
will secure an immeasurable benefit both to yourself and us.”
