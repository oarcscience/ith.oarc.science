id="iv.vi.iv.lxxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXIV</span>.—*The God whom he
had honored deservedly honored him in Return.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.lxxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.lxxiv-p2.1"></span>Such</span> are the proofs by which the
Supreme God has made it manifest to us, in the person of Constantine,
who alone of all sovereigns had openly professed the Christian faith,
how great a difference he perceives between those whose privilege it is
to worship him and his Christ, and those who have chosen the contrary
part, who provoked his enmity by daring to assail his Church, and whose
calamitous end, in every instance, afforded tokens of his displeasure,
as manifestly as the death of Constantine conveyed to all men an evident
assurance of his Divine love.
