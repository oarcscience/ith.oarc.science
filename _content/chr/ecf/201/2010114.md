<span id="iii.ix.v-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p1.1"></span>Chapter V.—</span>*The Bishops of Jerusalem
from the Age of our Saviour to the Period under Consideration*

<span id="iii.ix.v-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p2.1"></span>The</span> chronology of the bishops of
Jerusalem I have nowhere found preserved in writing; <span
id="fr_993"></span>[994](#fn_993) for tradition says that they were all
short lived.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p4"></span>2. But I have learned this much from
writings, <span id="fr_994"></span>[995](#fn_994) that until the siege
of the Jews, which took place under Adrian, <span
id="fr_995"></span>[996](#fn_995) there were fifteen bishops in
succession there, <span id="fr_996"></span>[997](#fn_996) all of whom
are said to have been of Hebrew descent, and to have received the
knowledge of Christ in purity, so that they were approved by those who
were able to judge of such matters, and were deemed worthy of the
episcopate. For their whole church consisted then of believing Hebrews
who continued from the days of the apostles until the siege which took
place at this time; in which siege the Jews, having again rebelled
against the Romans, were conquered after severe battles.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p8"></span>3. But since the bishops of the
circumcision ceased at this time, it is proper to give here a list of
their names from the beginning. The first, then, was James, the
so-called brother of the Lord; <span id="fr_997"></span>[998](#fn_997)
the second, Symeon; <span id="fr_998"></span>[999](#fn_998) the third,
Justus; <span id="fr_999"></span>[1000](#fn_999) the fourth,
Zacchæus; <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1001](#fn_1000) the fifth, Tobias;
the sixth, Benjamin; the seventh, John; the eighth, Matthias; the ninth,
Philip; the tenth, Seneca; <span id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001)
the eleventh, Justus; the twelfth, Levi; the thirteenth, Ephres; <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002) the fourteenth, Joseph; <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003) and finally, the fifteenth, Judas.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p16"></span>4. These are the bishops of Jerusalem
that lived between the age of the apostles and the time referred to, all
of them belonging to the circumcision.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p17"></span>5. In the twelfth year of the reign of
Adrian, Xystus, having completed the tenth year of <span
id="page_177">p. 177</span> <span id="iii.ix.v-Page_177"></span>his
episcopate, <span id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004) was succeeded by
Telesphorus, <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005) the seventh in
succession from the apostles. In the meantime, after the lapse of a year
and some months, Eumenes, <span id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006) the
sixth in order, succeeded to the leadership of the Alexandrian church,
his predecessor having held office eleven years. <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_993"></span>[176:994](2010114.htm#fr_993) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p3"></span> In his *Chron*. Eusebius also gives the
names of these bishops of Jerusalem, without assigning dates to more
than two or three of them. But in Nicephorus Callisti the dates are
given. From what source Nicephorus drew we do not know. He is, at any
rate, too late to be of any worth as an authority on such a subject. In
fact, these men were not regular monarchical bishops, holding office in
succession (see note 4), and hence Eusebius is quite excusable for his
ignorance in regard to their dates. See Ritschl’s *Entstehung der
alt-kath. Kirche*, p. 246 sq.

<span id="fn_994"></span>[176:995](2010114.htm#fr_994) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p5"></span> Reuterdahl (*De Fontibus Hist. eccles.
Euseb*., p. 55) conjectures that these “writings” were found in the
church of Jerusalem itself, and compares a passage in the *Dem. Evang*.
III. 5: “The first bishops that presided there \[i.e. at Jerusalem\] are
said to have been Jews, and their names are preserved by the inhabitants
of the country.” Had Hegesippus or any other known author been the
source of his information, he would probably have mentioned his name.

<span id="fn_995"></span>[176:996](2010114.htm#fr_995) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p6"></span> In 135 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p6.1"></span>a.d</span>. See below, chap. 7.

<span id="fn_996"></span>[176:997](2010114.htm#fr_996) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p7"></span> From Hegesippus (see above, Bk. III.
chap. 32) we learn that Symeon, the successor of James, was martyred
during Trajan’s reign. As was seen in note 6 of the chapter referred to,
the martyrdom probably occurred early in that reign. Eusebius, in his
*Chron*., refers the martyrdom and the accession of Justus to the tenth
year of Trajan (107 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p7.1"></span>a.d</span>.). This leaves thirteen bishops to
be inserted between 107 (or, if this date is not reliable, 98+) and 135
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.v-p7.2"></span>a.d</span>., which is,
to say the least, very suspicious. The true explanation appears to be
that, after the death of Symeon, the last prominent relative of Christ,
the presbyters took the lead, and that they were afterward made by
tradition into successive monarchical bishops. Closs and Gieseler
suppose that there were bishops of a number of churches in Palestine at
the same time, whom tradition made successive bishops of Jerusalem. But
the fact is, that the episcopate is of Greek, not of Jewish, origin, and
in the strictly Jewish Christian churches of Palestine no such person as
a bishop can have existed. Only after the church there came under the
influence of the Gentile church, and lost its prevailingly Jewish
character, was it possible for a bishop, in the general sense of the
term, to exist there. The Jewish Christians assumed for their church
government the form of the Jewish Sanhedrim, though while James and
Symeon were alive, they were naturally leaders (according to the common
Oriental custom, which exalted the relatives of the founder of a
religion). The Jewish character of the Jerusalem congregation was very
marked until the destruction of the city under Hadrian (note that all
but two of the fifteen bishops have Jewish names), after which all
circumcised Jews—Christians as well as unbelievers—were excluded, and a
heathen Christian congregation took its place (see the next chapter).
According to Stroth, followed by Closs, Stigloher, and Heinichen, the
church of Jerusalem remained in Pella after 70 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p7.3"></span>a.d</span>., and was called the church of
Jerusalem because it was made up of Christians from Jerusalem. This is
possible; but Eusebius evidently did not understand it so (compare, too,
his *Dem. Evang*. III. 5), and Epiphanius (*de Mensa et Pond*. chap 15)
says expressly that, after the destruction of the city by Titus, the
church returned again to Jerusalem, and there is no good reason to doubt
the report.

<span id="iii.ix.v-p9"></span> On James, see above, Bk. II chap. 1.

<span id="fn_998"></span>[176:999](2010114.htm#fr_998) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p10"></span> On Symeon, see above, Bk. III. chap. 11,
note 4.

<span id="fn_999"></span>[176:1000](2010114.htm#fr_999) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p11"></span> Of Justus and the following named
bishops we know nothing more. Justus is called Judas by Epiphanius,
*Hær*. LXVI. 20.

<span id="fn_1000"></span>[176:1001](2010114.htm#fr_1000) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p12"></span> Zacchæus is called Zacharias by
Epiphanius. According to Jerome’s version of Eusebius’ *Chron*. he
became bishop in the fifteenth year of Trajan; according to the Armenian
version, in the twelfth year. Dates are given by the *Chron*. for this
bishop and for Seneca, but no confidence is to be reposed in the dates,
nor in those given by Epiphanius and Eutychius. The former, when he
gives dates at all, is hopelessly at sea. The latter gives exact dates
for every bishop, but quite without the support of ancient tradition.

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[176:1002](2010114.htm#fr_1001) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p13"></span> The name Seneca is Latin, the only Latin
name in the list. But there is nothing particularly surprising in a
Jew’s bearing a Latin name. It was quite common even for native Jews to
bear both a Latin, or Greek, and a Hebrew name, and often the former was
used to the exclusion of the latter. The name therefore does not
disprove Seneca’s Hebrew origin.

<span id="fn_1002"></span>[176:1003](2010114.htm#fr_1002) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p14"></span> ᾽Εφρῆς. Epiphanius calls him ᾽Ου€φρις.
The Armenian version of the *Chron*. calls him Ephrem; Jerome’s version,
Ephres. Syncellus calls him ᾽Εφραΐμ, which is the Hebrew form of the
name.

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[176:1004](2010114.htm#fr_1003) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p15"></span> ᾽Ιωσήφ. He is called ᾽Ιωσίς by
Epiphanius, and Joses by Jerome.

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[177:1005](2010114.htm#fr_1004) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p18"></span> On Xystus, see chap. 4, note 3.

<span id="fn_1005"></span>[177:1006](2010114.htm#fr_1005) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p19"></span> Telesphorus was a martyr, according to
Irenæus, III. 3. 3 (compare below, chap. 10, and Bk. V. chap. 6), and
the tradition is too old to be doubted. Eusebius here agrees with
Jerome’s version of the *Chron.* in putting the date of Telesphorus’
accession in the year 128 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p19.1"></span>a.d.</span>, but the Armenian version puts it
in 124; and Lipsius, with whom Overbeck agrees, puts it between 124 and
126. Since he held office eleven years (according to Eusebius, chap. 10,
below, and other ancient catalogues), he must have died, according to
Lipsius and Overbeck, between 135 and 137 <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.ix.v-p19.2"></span>a.d.</span> (the latter being probably the
correct date), and not in the first year of Antoninus Pius (138 <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.ix.v-p19.3"></span>a.d.</span>), as Eusebius
states in chap. 10, below. Tradition says that he fought against Marcion
and Valentinus (which is quite possible), and that he was very strict in
regard to fasts, sharpening them and increasing their number, which may
or may not be true.

<span id="fn_1006"></span>[177:1007](2010114.htm#fr_1006) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p19.4"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p20"></span> We know nothing more about Eumenes. He
is said in chap. 11 to have held office thirteen years, and this brings
the date of his death into agreement with the date given by the Armenian
version of the *Chron.,* which differs by two years from the date given
by Jerome.

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[177:1008](2010114.htm#fr_1007) <span
id="iii.ix.v-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ix.v-p21"></span> His predecessor was Justus. See the
previous chapter.
