id="iv.vi.i.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*That he was the Son of a
Pious Emperor, and bequeathed the Power to Royal Sons.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.ix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.ix-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> did he give this testimony in
words merely, while exhibiting failure in his own practice, but pursued
every path of virtue, and was rich in the varied fruits of godliness. He
ensured the affection of his friends by magnificent proofs of
liberality; and inasmuch as he governed on principles of humanity, he
caused his rule to be but lightly felt and acceptable to all classes of
his subjects; until at last, after a long course of years, and when he
was wearied by his divine labors, the God whom he honored crowned him
with an immortal reward, and translated him from a transitory kingdom to
that endless life which he has laid up in store for the souls of his
saints, after he had raised him up three sons to succeed him in his
power. As then the imperial throne had descended to him from his father,
so, by the law of nature, was it reserved for his children and their
descendants, and perpetuated, like some paternal inheritance, to endless
generations. And indeed God himself, who distinguished this blessed
prince with divine honors while yet present with us, and who has adorned
his death with choice blessings from his own hand, should be the writer
of his actions; since he has recorded his labors and successes on
heavenly monuments. <span id="fr_3070"></span>[3071](#fn_3070)
