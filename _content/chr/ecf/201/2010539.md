<span id="iv.vi.iii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*Exhortation to obey
the Decrees of the Council.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xx-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xx-p2.1"></span>Receive</span>, then, with all willingness
this truly Divine injunction, and regard it as in truth the gift of God.
For whatever is determined in the holy assemblies of the bishops is to
be regarded as indicative of the Divine will. As soon, therefore, as you
have communicated these proceedings to all our beloved brethren, you are
bound from that time forward to adopt for yourselves, and to enjoin on
others the arrangement above mentioned, and the due observance of this
most sacred day; that whenever I come into the presence of your love,
which I have long desired, I may have it in my power to celebrate the
holy feast with you on the same day, and may rejoice with you on all
accounts, when I behold the cruel power of Satan removed by Divine aid
through the agency of our endeavors, while your faith, and peace, and
concord everywhere flourish. God preserve you, beloved brethren!”

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xx-p3"></span>The emperor transmitted a faithful
copy <span id="fr_3258"></span>[3259](#fn_3258) of this letter to every
province, wherein they who read it might discern as in a mirror the pure
sincerity of his thoughts, and of his piety toward God.
