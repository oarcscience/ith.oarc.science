Irenæus which have come down to us.*

<span id="iii.x.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xxvii-p2.1"></span>Besides</span> the works and letters of
Irenæus which we have mentioned, <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[1722](#fn_1721) a certain book of his On Knowledge,
written against the Greeks, <span id="fr_1722"></span>[1723](#fn_1722)
very concise and remarkably forcible, is extant; and another, which he
dedicated to a brother Marcian, In Demonstration of the Apostolic
Preaching; <span id="fr_1723"></span>[1724](#fn_1723) and a volume
containing various Dissertations, <span
id="fr_1724"></span>[1725](#fn_1724) in which he mentions the Epistle to
the Hebrews and the so-called Wisdom of Solomon, making <span
id="page_245">p. 245</span> <span
id="iii.x.xxvii-Page_245"></span>quotations from them. These are the
works of Irenæus which have come to our knowledge.

<span id="iii.x.xxvii-p7"></span>Commodus having ended his reign after
thirteen years, Severus became emperor in less than six months after his
death, Pertinax having reigned during the intervening time. <span

<span id="iii.x.xxvii-p3"></span> For a general summary of the works of
Irenæus mentioned by Eusebius, see Bk. IV. chap. 21, note 9.

<span id="fn_1722"></span>[244:1723](2010167.htm#fr_1722) <span
id="iii.x.xxvii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.x.xxvii-p4"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxvii-p4.1"></span>πρὸς ῞Ελληνας λόγος</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxvii-p4.2"></span>…</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxvii-p4.3"></span>περὶ ἐπιστήμης</span>.
Jerome (*de vir. ill.* 35) makes two works out of this: one *Against the
Gentiles,* and another *On Knowledge (et contra Gentes volumen breve, et
de disciplina aliud).* Harvey (I. p. clxvi.) states that one of the
Syriac fragments of Irenæus’ works mentions the work of Eusebius *On
Knowledge,* and specifies that it was directed against the Valentinians.
In that case it would be necessary to make two separate works, as Jerome
does, and so Harvey thinks that the text of Eusebius must be amended by
the insertion of an <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxvii-p4.4"></span>ἄ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxvii-p4.5"></span>λλος τε</span>. Unfortunately, Harvey did
not name the Syriac fragment which contains the statement referred to,
and it is not to be found among those collected in his edition
(Venables, in Smith and Wace, states that he could find no such
fragment, and I have also searched in vain for it). Evidently some
blunder has been committed, and it looks as if Harvey’s statement were
unverifiable. Meanwhile, Jerome’s testimony alone is certainly not
enough to warrant an emendation of the text in opposition to all the
<span class="c13"><span id="iii.x.xxvii-p4.6"></span>mss.</span> and
versions. We must therefore conclude, with our present light, that the
treatise <span class="Greek"><span id="iii.x.xxvii-p4.7"></span>περὶ
ἐπιστήμης</span> was directed against the Greeks, as Eusebius says. The
work has entirely perished, with the possible exception of a single
brief fragment (the first of the Pfaffian fragments; *Gr. Frag.* XXXV.
in Harvey’s edition), which Harvey refers to it.

<span id="iii.x.xxvii-p5"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxvii-p5.1"></span>εἰς ἐπίδειξιν τοῦ ἀποστολικοῦ
κηρύγματος</span>. This work, too, has perished, though possibly a few
of the fragments published by Harvey are to be referred to it (see
Harvey, I. p. clxvii.). Harvey conjectures that the work discussed the
articles of the early Rule of faith, which is quite possible. Of the
“brother Marcian” to whom it was addressed, we know nothing.

<span id="fn_1724"></span>[244:1725](2010167.htm#fr_1724) <span

<span id="iii.x.xxvii-p6"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.x.xxvii-p6.1"></span>βίβλιον τι διαλέξεων διαφόρων</span>. This
work (no longer extant) was probably, as Harvey remarks, “a collection
of sermons and expositions of various texts and passages of Scripture.”
To it are undoubtedly to be referred a great many of the fragments in
which passages of Scripture are discussed (see Harvey, I. p. clxvii.).

<span id="iii.x.xxvii-p8"></span> Commodus was strangled on the 31st of
December, 192, and Pertinax, who immediately succeeded him, was
murdered, on March 28, 193, by the Prætorian guard, which then sold the
imperial power to Didius Julianus, who, at the approach of Septimius
Severus, who had been proclaimed emperor by the Pannonian legions, was
declared a public enemy by the Senate, and beheaded after a reign of
only sixty-six days.
