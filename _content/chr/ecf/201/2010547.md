<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxviii-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span

without delay. But as soon as the original surface of the ground,
beneath the covering of earth, appeared, immediately, and contrary to
all expectation, the venerable and hollowed monument of our Saviour’s
resurrection was discovered. Then indeed did this most holy cave present
a faithful simili<span id="page_528">p. 528</span> <span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxviii-Page_528"></span>tude of his return to life, in
that, after lying buried in darkness, it again emerged to light, and
afforded to all who came to witness the sight, a clear and visible proof
of the wonders of which that spot had once been the scene, a testimony

compare Besant, *Sepulchre, the Holy,* in Smith and Cheetham, 2 (1880),
1881–1888. He discusses (*a*) Is the present site that fixed upon by the
officers of Constantine? and (*b*) Was that site certainly or even
probably the true spot where our Lord was buried? Compare also reports
of the Palestine Exploration Fund Survey, *Jerusalem,* 1884, p. 429–435
(Conder).
