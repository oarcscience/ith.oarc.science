<span id="iii.xi.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—</span>*Fabianus, who was
wonderfully designated Bishop of Rome by God.*

<span id="iii.xi.xxix-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xxix-p2.1"></span>Gordianus</span> succeeded Maximinus as
Roman emperor; <span id="fr_2008"></span>[2009](#fn_2008) and
Pontianus, <span id="fr_2009"></span>[2010](#fn_2009) who had <span
id="page_275">p. 275</span> <span id="iii.xi.xxix-Page_275"></span>been
bishop of the church at Rome for six years, was succeeded by
Anteros. <span id="fr_2010"></span>[2011](#fn_2010) After he had held
the office for a month, Fabianus <span
id="fr_2011"></span>[2012](#fn_2011) succeeded him.

<span id="iii.xi.xxix-p7"></span>2. They say <span
id="fr_2012"></span>[2013](#fn_2012) that Fabianus having come, after
the death of Anteros, with others from the country, was staying at Rome,
and that while there he was chosen to the office through a most
wonderful manifestation of divine and heavenly grace.

<span id="iii.xi.xxix-p9"></span>3. For when all the brethren had
assembled to select by vote him who should succeed to the episcopate of
the church, several renowned and honorable men were in the minds of
many, but Fabianus, although present, was in the mind of none. But they
relate that suddenly a dove flying down lighted on his head, resembling
the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Saviour in the form of a dove.

<span id="iii.xi.xxix-p10"></span>4. Thereupon all the people, as if
moved by one Divine Spirit, with all eagerness and unanimity cried out
that he was worthy, and without delay they took him and placed him upon
the episcopal seat. <span id="fr_2013"></span>[2014](#fn_2013)

<span id="iii.xi.xxix-p12"></span>5. About that time Zebinus, <span
id="fr_2014"></span>[2015](#fn_2014) bishop of Antioch died, and
Babylas <span id="fr_2015"></span>[2016](#fn_2015) succeeded him. And in
Alexandria Heraclas, <span id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016) having
received the episcopal office after Demetrius, <span
id="fr_2017"></span>[2018](#fn_2017) was succeeded in the charge of the
catechetical school by Dionysius, <span
id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018) who had also been one of Origen’s
pupils.

<span id="iii.xi.xxix-p3"></span> Gordianus the younger, grandson of
Gordianus I., and nephew (or son?) of Gordianus II., became emperor
after the murder of Balbinus and Pupienus, in July, 238, at the age of
fifteen years, and reigned until early in the year 244, when he was
murdered by the soldiers and succeeded by Philip. He is made by Eusebius
(both here and in the *Chron.*) the direct successor of Maximinus,
simply because only two or three months elapsed between the death of the
latter and his own accession.

<span id="fn_2010"></span>[275:2011](2010199.htm#fr_2010) <span
id="iii.xi.xxix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xi.xxix-p5"></span> Both here and in the *Chron.* the
accession of Anteros is synchronized with the accession of Gordianus,
but as seen in chap. 23, note 3, Pontianus was succeeded by Anteros in
the first year of Maximinus, i.e. in 235,—three years earlier,
therefore, than the date given by Eusebius. All the authorities agree in
assigning only one month and a few days to the episcopate of Anteros,
and this is to be accepted as correct. Of the life and character of
Anteros we know nothing.

<span id="fn_2011"></span>[275:2012](2010199.htm#fr_2011) <span

<span id="iii.xi.xxix-p6"></span> Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xi.xxix-p6.1"></span>Φαβιανός</span>, though some <span
class="c13"><span id="iii.xi.xxix-p6.2"></span>mss.</span> read <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xi.xxix-p6.3"></span>Φλαβιανός</span>. The
Armenian and Hieronymian *Chron.* call him Fabianus; the Liberian
catalogue, Fabius; Eutychius and the Alex. cat., Flabianus. According to
chap. 39, he suffered martyrdom in the persecution of Decius (250–251).
Both versions of the *Chron.* assign thirteen years to his episcopate,
and this agrees fairly well with the notices here and in chap. 39
(accession in 238 and death in 250 or 251). But, as already seen,
Eusebius is quite wrong in the dates which he gives for the accession of
these three bishops, and the statements of the Liberian catalogue are to
be accepted, which put Fabian’s accession in January, 236, and his death
in January, 250, after an episcopate of fourteen years and ten days. The
martyrdom of Fabian rests upon good authority (cf. chap. 39, and
Jerome’s *de vir. ill.* chap. 54, and especially Cyprian’s *Epistles,*
3, *al.* 9, and 30). From these epistles we learn that he was a man of
ability and virtue. He stands out more clearly in the light of history
than most of the early Roman bishops, but tradition has handed down a
great many unfounded stories in regard to him (see the article in the
*Dict. of Christ. Biog.*).

for the following story. Rufinus (VI. 21) tells a similar tale in
connection with Zephyrinus.

<span id="iii.xi.xxix-p14"></span> Babylas occupies an illustrious place
in the list of ancient martyrs (cf. Tillemont, *Mem.* III. 400–409).
Chrysostom devoted a festal oration to his memory (*In sanctum Babylam
contra Julianum et contra Gentiles*); while Jerome, Epiphanius, Sozomen,
Theodoret, and others make honorable mention of him. There are extant
the *Acta Babylæ* (spurious), which, however, confound him with a martyr
who suffered under Numerian. The legends in regard to Babylas and to the
miracles performed by his bones are very numerous (see Tillemont,
*l.c.*). He is identified by Chrysostom and others with the bishop
mentioned by Eusebius in chap. 34, and there is no good reason to doubt
the identification (see Harnack, *Zeit des Ignatius,* p. 48). The fact
of his martyrdom under Decius (see chap. 39) is too well attested to
admit of doubt; though upon the manner of it, not all the traditions are
agreed, Eusebius reporting that he died in prison, Chrysostom that he
died by violence. The account of Eusebius seems the most reliable. The
date of his accession is unknown, but there is no reason to doubt that
it took place during the reign of Gordian (238–244), as Eusebius here
seems to imply; though it is true that he connects it closely with the
death of Demetrius, which certainly took place not later than 232 (see
above, Bk. V. chap. 22, note 4). There is no warrant for carrying the
accession of Babylas back so far as that.
