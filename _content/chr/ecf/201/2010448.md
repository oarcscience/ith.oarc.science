<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*How Constantine was
stirred in Behalf of the Christians thus in Danger of Persecution.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p2.1"></span>He</span>, perceiving the evils of which
he had heard to be no longer tolerable, took wise counsel, and tempering
the natural clemency of his character with a certain measure of
severity, hastened to succor those who were thus grievously oppressed.
For he judged that it would rightly be deemed a pious and holy task to
secure, by the removal of an individual, the safety of the greater part
of the human race. He judged too, that if he listened to the dictates of
clemency only, and bestowed his pity on one utterly unworthy of it, this
would, on the one hand, confer no real benefit on a man whom nothing
would induce to abandon his evil practices, and whose fury against his
subjects would only be likely to in<span id="page_501">p. 501</span>
<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-Page_501"></span>crease; <span
id="fr_3162"></span>[3163](#fn_3162) while, on the other hand, those who
suffered from his oppression would thus be forever deprived of all hope
of deliverance.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p4"></span>Influenced by these reflections, the
emperor resolved without farther delay to extend a protecting hand to
those who had fallen into such an extremity of distress. He accordingly
made the usual warlike preparations, and assembled his whole forces,
both of horse and foot. But before them all was carried the standard
which I have before described, as the symbol of his full confidence in
God.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iii-p3"></span> This seems to intend some exoneration
of Constantine, explaining why he was what the heathen called
“faithless” towards Licinius.
