id="iii.xi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.—</span>*Ambrose.*

<span id="iii.xi.xviii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xi.xviii-p2.1"></span>About</span> this time Ambrose, <span
id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897) who held the heresy of
Valentinus, <span id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898) was convinced by
Origen’s presentation of the truth, and, as if his mind were illumined
by light, he accepted the orthodox doctrine of the Church.

<span id="iii.xi.xviii-p5"></span>2. Many others also, drawn by the fame
of Origen’s learning, which resounded everywhere, came to him to make
trial of his skill in sacred literature. And a great many heretics, and
not a few of the most distinguished philosophers, studied under him
diligently, receiving instruction from him not only in divine things,
but also in secular philosophy.

<span id="iii.xi.xviii-p6"></span>3. For when he perceived that any
persons had superior intelligence he instructed them also in philosophic
branches—in geometry, arithmetic, and other preparatory studies—and then
advanced to the systems <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899) of
the philosophers and explained their writings. And he made observations
and comments upon each of them, so that he became celebrated as a great
philosopher even among the Greeks themselves.

<span id="iii.xi.xviii-p8"></span>4. And he instructed many of the less
learned in the common school branches, <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900) saying that these would be no small
help to them in the study and understanding of the Divine Scriptures. On
this account he considered it especially necessary for himself to be
skilled in secular and philosophic learning. <span

<span id="iii.xi.xviii-p3"></span> Of the early life of Ambrose, the
friend of Origen, we know nothing. We learn from Origen’s *Exhortatio ad
Martyr.* c. 14, and Jerome’s *de vir. ill.* c. 56, that he was of a
wealthy and noble family (cf. chap. 23 of this book), and from the
*Exhort. ad Mart.* c. 36, that he probably held some high official
position. Eusebius says here that he was for some time a Valentinian,
Jerome that he was a Marcionite, others give still different reports.
However that was, the authorities all agree that he was converted to the
orthodox faith by Origen, and that he remained devoted to him for the
rest of his life. From chap. 23 we learn that he urged Origen to
undertake the composition of commentaries on the Scriptures, and that he
furnished ample pecuniary means for the prosecution of the work. He was
also himself a diligent student, as we gather from that chapter (cf.
also Jerome, *de vir. ill.* c. 56). From chap. 28 we learn that he was a
confessor in the persecution of Maximinus (Jerome calls him also a
deacon), and it seems to have been in Cæsarea or its neighborhood that
he suffered, whither he had gone undoubtedly on account of his affection
for Origen, who was at that time there (cf. the *Exhort.* c. 41). He is
mentioned for the last time in the dedication and conclusion of Origen’s
*Contra Celsum,* which was written between 246 and 250 (see chap. 36,
below). Jerome (*l.c.*) states that he died before Origen, so that he
cannot have lived long after this. He left no writings, except some
epistles which are no longer extant. Jerome, however, in his *Ep. ad
Marcellam,* §1 (Migne’s ed., *Ep.* 43), attributes to Ambrose an
epistle, a fragment of which is extant under the name of Origen (to whom
it doubtless belongs) and which is printed in Lommatzsch’s edition of
Origen’s works, Vol. XVII. p. 5. Origen speaks of him frequently as a
man of education and of literary tastes and devoted to the study of the
Scriptures, and Jerome says of him*non inelegantis ingenii fuit, sicut
ejus ad Origenen epistolæ indicio sunt (l.c.).* The affection which
Origen felt for him is evinced by many notices in his works and by the
fact that he dedicated to him the *Exhortatio ad Martyr*., on the
occasion of his suffering under Maximinus. It was also at Ambrose’s
solicitation that he wrote his great work against Celsus, which he
likewise dedicated to him.
