<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII</span>.—*How Constantine
received Instruction, and read the Sacred Scriptures.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxii-p2.1"></span>These</span> things were done shortly
afterwards. But at the time above specified, being struck with amazement
at the extraordinary vision, and resolving to worship no other God save
Him who had appeared to him, he sent for those who were acquainted with
the mysteries of His doctrines, and enquired who that God was, and what
was intended by the sign of the vision he had seen. They affirmed that
He was God, the only begotten Son of the one and only God: that the sign
which had appeared was the symbol of immortality, <span
id="fr_3115"></span>[3116](#fn_3115) and the trophy of that victory over
death which He had gained in time past when sojourning on earth. They
taught him also the causes of His advent, and explained to him the true
account of His incarnation. Thus he was instructed in these matters, and
was impressed with wonder at the divine manifestation which had been
presented to his sight. Comparing, therefore, the heavenly vision with
the interpretation given, he found his judgment confirmed; and, in the
persuasion that the knowledge of these things had been imparted to him
by Divine teaching, he determined thenceforth to devote himself to the
reading of the Inspired writings.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxii-p4"></span>Moreover, he made the priests of God
his counselors, and deemed it incumbent on him to honor the God who had
appeared to him with all devotion. And after this, being fortified by
well-grounded hopes in Him, he hastened to quench the threatening fire
of tyranny.

<span id="iv.vi.i.xxxii-p3"></span> Both Socrates (5. 17) and Sozomen
(7. 15) relate that symbols of the cross found in a temple of Serapis,
on its destruction by Theodosius, were explained by the Christians of
the time as symbols of immortality. Cf. also Suidas (ed. Gasiford, 2
(1834), 3398), s. v. <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vi.i.xxxii-p3.1"></span>Σταυροί</span>; Valesius on Socrates and
Sozomen; Jablonski, *Opuscula,* 1, p. 156– . The study of the
pre-christian use of the cross is most suggestive. It suggests at least
that in some way the passion of our Lord was the realization of some
world-principle or “natural Law.”
