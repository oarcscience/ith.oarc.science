id="iv.vi.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*How he wrote to
the Egyptians, exhorting them to Peace.*

<span id="iv.vi.iii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>And</span> now, when all else were at
peace, among the Egyptians alone an implacable contention still
raged, <span id="fr_3260"></span>[3261](#fn_3260) so as once more to
disturb the emperor’s tranquillity, though not to excite his anger. For
indeed he treated the contending parties with all respect, as fathers,
nay rather, as prophets of God; and again he summoned them to his
presence, and again patiently acted as mediator between them, and
honored them with gifts, and communicated also the result of his
arbitration by letter. He confirmed and sanctioned the decrees of the
council, and called on them to strive earnestly for concord, and not to
distract and rend the Church, but to keep before them the thought of
God’s judgment. And these injunctions the emperor sent by a letter
written with his own hand.
