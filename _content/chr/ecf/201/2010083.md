Abilius was ordained presbyter with his successor Cerdon by Mark himself
(see Smith and Wace). According to another (*Ap. Const.* VII. 46) he was
appointed bishop by Luke. He held office thirteen years according to
chap. 21, below. Valesius claims that the name should be written
Avilius, regarding it as a Latin name, and citing in support of his
opinion the name of a prefect of Egypt, Avilius Flaccus, mentioned by
Philo, and the fact that the name of Avilius’ predecessor, Annianus, is
also Latin.
