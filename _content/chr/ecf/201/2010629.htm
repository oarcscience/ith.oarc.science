 Accordingly they all took their departure from the province of Ph&#339;nicia, and proceeded to their destination, availing themselves of the public means of transport. Thus Jerusalem became the gathering point for distinguished prelates from every province, and the whole city was thronged by a vast assemblage of the servants of God. The Macedonians had sent the bishop of their metropolis;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3340"></A><A HREF="#fn_3340"><FONT SIZE="1">3341</FONT></A>

A holy prelate from Persia too was there, deeply versed in the sacred oracles; while Bithynian and Thracian bishops graced the Council with their presence; nor were the most illustrious from Cilicia wanting, nor the chief of the Cappadocians, distinguished above all for learning and eloquence. In short, the whole of Syria and Mesopotamia, Ph&#339;nicia and Arabia, Palestine, Egypt, and Libya, with the dwellers in the Thebaid, all contributed to swell the mighty concourse of God&#146;s ministers, followed as they were by vast numbers from every province. They were attended by an imperial escort,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3341"></A><A HREF="#fn_3341"><FONT SIZE="1">3342</FONT></A>
 and officers of trust had also been sent from the palace itself, with instructions to heighten the splendor of the festival at the emperor&#146;s expense.</p>
