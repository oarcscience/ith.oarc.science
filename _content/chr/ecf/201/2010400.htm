<p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.i.xv-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.i.xv-p2.1"></A>By</span> command of the supreme authorities of the empire, the governors of the several provinces had set on foot a general persecution of the godly. Indeed, it was from the imperial courts themselves that the very first of the pious martyrs proceeded, who passed through those conflicts for the faith, and most readily endured both fire and sword, and the depths of the sea; every form of death, in short, so that in a brief time all the royal palaces were bereft of pious men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3082"></A><A HREF="#fn_3082"><FONT SIZE="1">3083</FONT></A>
 The result was, that the authors of this wickedness were entirely deprived of the protecting care of God, since by their persecution of his worshipers they at the same time silenced the prayers that were wont to be made on their own behalf.</p>
