<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.—</span>*The Epistles of
Dionysius.*

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>Besides</span> these, many other epistles
of Dionysius are extant, as those against Sabellius, <span
id="fr_2365"></span>[2366](#fn_2365) addressed to Ammon, <span
id="fr_2366"></span>[2367](#fn_2366) bishop of the church of Bernice,
and one to Telesphorus, <span id="fr_2367"></span>[2368](#fn_2367) and
one to Euphranor, and again another to Ammon and Euporus. He wrote also
four other books on the same subject, which he addressed to his namesake
Dionysius, in Rome. <span id="fr_2368"></span>[2369](#fn_2368)

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p7"></span>2. Besides these many of his epistles
are with us, and large books written in epistolary form, as those on
Nature, <span id="fr_2369"></span>[2370](#fn_2369) addressed to the
young man Timothy, and one on Temptations, <span
id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370) which he also dedicated to
Euphranor.

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p10"></span>3. Moreover, in a letter to
Basilides, <span id="fr_2371"></span>[2372](#fn_2371) bishop of the
parishes in Pentapolis, he says that he had written an exposition of the
beginning of Ecclesiastes. <span id="fr_2372"></span>[2373](#fn_2372)
And he has left us also various letters <span id="page_312">p.
312</span> <span id="iii.xii.xxvii-Page_312"></span>addressed to this
same person. Thus much Dionysius.

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p13"></span>But our account of these matters
being now completed, permit us to show to posterity the character of our
own age. <span id="fr_2373"></span>[2374](#fn_2373)

<span id="fn_2365"></span>[311:2366](2010244.htm#fr_2365) <span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p2.2"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p3"></span> On Sabellius, and on Dionysius’
attitude toward Sabellianism, see above, chap. 6, note 1.

<span id="fn_2366"></span>[311:2367](2010244.htm#fr_2366) <span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p4"></span> The works addressed to Ammon,
Telesphorus, Euphranor, and Euporus, are no longer extant, nor do we
know anything about them (but see chap. 6, note 2, above). It is
possible that it was in these epistles that Dionysius laid himself open
in his zeal against the Sabellians to the charge of tritheism, which
aroused complaints against him, and resulted in his being obliged to
defend himself in his work addressed to Dionysius of Rome. If so, these
letters must have been written before that work, though perhaps not long
before. Of Ammon himself we know nothing. There were a number of cities
in North Africa, called Berenice (the form Bernice is exceptional), but,
according to Wiltsch, Berenice, a city of Libya Pentapolis, or
Cyrenaica, is meant in the present case. This city (whose original name
was Hesperides) lay on the Mediterranean some six hundred miles west of
Alexandria.

<span id="fn_2367"></span>[311:2368](2010244.htm#fr_2367) <span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p5"></span> Of Telesphorus, Euphranor, and
Euporus, we know nothing.

<span id="fn_2368"></span>[311:2369](2010244.htm#fr_2368) <span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p6"></span> On these books addressed to
Dionysius of Rome, see below, p. 397.

<span id="fn_2369"></span>[311:2370](2010244.htm#fr_2369) <span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p8"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p8.1"></span>οἱ περὶ φύσεως</span>. The date and
immediate occasion of this work cannot be determined. The supposition of
Dittrich, that it was written before Dionysius became bishop, while he
had more leisure than afterward for philosophical study, has much in its
favor. The young man, Timothy, to whom it was addressed, is perhaps to
be identified with the one mentioned in Bk. VI. chap. 40, §4. That it
was a work of considerable extent, embracing more than one book, is
indicated by Eusebius in this passage. A long extract from it is given
by Eusebius in his *Præp. Evang.* XIV. 23–27 (printed with commentary by
Routh, *Rel. Sac.* IV. p. 393 sq.; translated in the *Ante-Nicene
Fathers,* Vol. VI. p. 84–91), and a few fragments are still preserved in
a Vatican codex, and have been published by Simon de Magistris, in his
edition of Dionysius’ works (Rome, 1796), p. 44 sq. (cf. also Routh, IV.
p. 418, 419). In the extract quoted by Eusebius, Dionysius deals solely
with the atomic theory of Democritus and Epicurus. This subject may have
occupied the greater part of the work, but evidently, as Dittrich
remarks (*Dionysius der Grosse,* p. 12), the doctrines of other
physicists were also dealt with (cf. the words with which Eusebius
introduces his extracts; *Præp. Evang.* XIV. 22. 10: “I will subjoin
from the books \[of Dionysius\] *On Nature* a few of the things urged
against Epicurus.” The translation in the *Ante-Nicene Fathers,* Vol.
VI. p. 84, note 7, which implies that the work was written “against the
Epicureans” is not correct). <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p8.2"></span>φύσις</span> seems to have been taken by
Dionysius in the sense of the “Universe” (compare, for instance, the
words of Cicero, *De nat. deorum,* II., to which Dittrich refers: *Sunt
autem, qui naturæ nomine rerum universitatem intelligunt*), and to have
been devoted to a refutation of the doctrines of various heathen
philosophers in regard to the origin of the universe. For a fuller
discussion of the work, see Dittrich, *ibid.* p. 12 sq.

<span id="fn_2370"></span>[311:2371](2010244.htm#fr_2370) <span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p8.3"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p9"></span> This work on Temptations (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p9.1"></span>περὶ
πειρασμῶν</span>) is no longer extant, nor do we know anything about the
time or occasion of its composition. Dittrich strangely omits all
reference to it. Of Euphranor, as remarked in note 3, we know nothing.

<span id="fn_2371"></span>[311:2372](2010244.htm#fr_2371) <span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p11"></span> Of this Basilides we know only what
Eusebius tells us here, that he was bishop of the “parishes in
Pentapolis” (or Cyrenaica, a district, and under the Romans a province,
lying west of Egypt, along the Mediterranean Sea), which would seem to
imply that he was metropolitan of that district (cf. Routh, *Rel. Sac.*
III. p. 235). A canonical epistle addressed to him by Dionysius is still
extant (see above, Bk. VI. chap. 40, note 1). Eusebius tells us that
Dionysius addressed “various epistles” to him, but no others are known
to us.

<span id="fn_2372"></span>[311:2373](2010244.htm#fr_2372) <span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p12"></span> It is possible that this work also,
like that *On Nature,* was written, as Dittrich thinks, before Dionysius
became bishop. Eusebius evidently had not seen the commentary himself,
for he speaks only of Dionysius’ reference to it. A few fragments,
supposed to be parts of this commentary, were published in the appendix
to the fourteenth volume of Galland’s *Bibliotheca Patrum Veterum,*
after the latter’s death, and were afterward reprinted in De Magistris’
edition of Dionysius’ works, p. 1 sq. (English translation in the
*Ante-Nicene Fathers,* VI. p. 111–114). The fragments, or at least a
part of them, are ascribed to Dionysius in the codex in which they are
found, and are very likely genuine, though we cannot speak with
certainty. For fuller particulars, see Dittrich, p. 22 sq.

<span id="fn_2373"></span>[312:2374](2010244.htm#fr_2373) <span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xii.xxvii-p14"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.xii.xxvii-p14.1"></span>τὴν καθ᾽ ἡμᾶς γενε€ν</span>. This seems
to indicate that the events recorded by Eusebius from this point on took
place during his own lifetime. See above, p. 4.
