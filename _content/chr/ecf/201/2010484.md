<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX</span>.—*The Treasury must
restore Lands, Gardens, and Houses to the Churches.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxix-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxix-p2.1"></span>Nor</span> shall the treasury itself,
should it have any of the things we have spoken of, be permitted to keep
them; but, without venturing as it were to raise its voice against the
holy churches, it shall justly relinquish in their favor what it has for
a time unjustly retained. We ordain, therefore, that all things
whatsoever which shall appear righteously to belong to the churches,
whether the property consist of houses or fields and gardens, or
whatever the nature of it may be, shall be restored in their full value
and integrity, and with undiminished right of possession.
