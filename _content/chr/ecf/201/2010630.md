id="iv.vi.iv.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV</span>.—*Of their Reception
by the Notary Marianus; the Distribution of Money to the Poor; and
Offerings to the Church.*

<span id="iv.vi.iv.xliv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span

officers was a most useful servant of the emperor, a man eminent for
faith and piety, and thoroughly acquainted with the Divine word, who had
been honorably conspicuous by his profession of godliness during the
time of the tyrants’ power, and therefore was deservedly entrusted with
the arrangement of the present proceedings. Accordingly, in faithful
obedience to the emperor’s commands, he received the assembly with
courteous hospitality, and entertained them with <span id="page_552">p.

on a scale of great splendor. He also distributed lavish supplies of
money and clothing among the naked and destitute, and the multitudes of
both sexes who suffered from want of food and the common necessaries of
life. Finally, he enriched and beautified the church itself throughout
with offerings of imperial magnificence, and thus fully accomplished the
service he had been commissioned to perform.
