<p class="c18"><a name="iii.xi.x-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iii.xi.x-p2.1"></A>Narcissus</span> having departed, and no one knowing where he was, those presiding over the neighboring churches thought it best to ordain another bishop. His name was Dius.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1818"></A><A HREF="#fn_1818"><FONT SIZE="1">1819</FONT></A>
 He presided but a short time, and Germanio succeeded him. He was followed by Gordius,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1819"></A><A HREF="#fn_1819"><FONT SIZE="1">1820</FONT></A>
 in whose time Narcissus appeared again, as if raised from the dead.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1820"></A><A HREF="#fn_1820"><FONT SIZE="1">1821</FONT></A>
 And immediately the brethren besought him to take the episcopate, as all admired him the more on account of his retirement and philosophy, and especially because of the punishment with which God had avenged him.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.x-p3"></A> Of these three bishops, Dius, Germanio, and Gordius, we know nothing more than is told us here. Syncellus assigns eight years to Dius, four to Germanio, and five to Sardianus, whom he names instead of Gordius. Epiphanius reports that Dius was bishop until Severus (193 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xi.x-p3.1"></A>a.d.</span>), and Gordius until Antonine (i.e. Caracalla, 211 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xi.x-p3.2"></A>a.d.</span>). But no reliance is to be placed upon these figures or dates, as remarked above, Bk. V. chap. 12, note 2.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.x-p4"></A> Eusebius and Epiphanius give <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.x-p4.1"></A>&#932;&#8057;&#961;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>, and Jerome, Gordius; but the Armenian has Gordianus, and Syncellus, <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.x-p4.2"></A>&#931;&#945;&#961;&#948;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#8057;&#962;</span>. What became of Gordius when Narcissus reappeared we do not know. He must have died very speedily, or some compromise would have been made, as it seems, which would have rendered the appointment of Alexander as assistant bishop unnecessary.</p>
