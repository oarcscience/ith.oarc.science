<span id="iv.vi.iv.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.iv.i-p3.1"></span>While</span> thus variously engaged in
promoting the extension and glory of the church of God, and striving by
every measure to commend the Saviour’s doctrine, the emperor was far
from neglecting secular affairs; but in this respect also he was
unwearied in bestowing benefits of every kind and in quick succession on
the people of every province. On the one hand he manifested a paternal
anxiety for the general welfare of his subjects; on the other he would
distinguish individuals of his own acquaintance with various marks of
honor; conferring his benefits in every instance in a truly noble
spirit. No one could request a favor from the emperor, and fail of
obtaining what he sought: no one expected a boon from him, and found
that expectation vain. <span id="fr_3307"></span>[3308](#fn_3307) Some
received presents in money, others in land; some obtained the Prætorian
præfecture, others senatorial, others again consular rank: many were
appointed provincial governors: others were made counts of the first,
second, or third order: in numberless instances the title of Most
Illustrious and many other distinctions were conferred; for the emperor
devised new dignities, that he might invest a larger number with the
tokens of his favor.
