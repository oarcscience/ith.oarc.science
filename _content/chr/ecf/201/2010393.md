<span id="iv.vi.i.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*That he conquered
nearly the Whole World.*

<span id="iv.vi.i.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.i.viii-p2.1"></span>But</span> our emperor began his reign at
the time of life at which the Macedonian died, yet doubled the length of
his life, and trebled the length of his reign. And instructing his army
in the mild and sober precepts of godliness, he carried his arms as far
as the Britons, and the nations that dwell in the very bosom of the
Western ocean. He subdued likewise all Scythia, though situated in the
remotest North, and divided into numberless diverse and barbarous
tribes. He even pushed his conquests to the Blemmyans and Ethiopians, on
the very confines of the South; nor did he think the acquisition of the
Eastern nations unworthy his care. In short, diffusing the effulgence of
his holy light to the ends of the whole world, even to the most distant
Indians, the nations dwelling on the extreme circumference of the
inhabited earth, he received the submission of all the rulers, <span
id="fr_3068"></span>[3069](#fn_3068) governors, <span
id="fr_3069"></span>[3070](#fn_3069) and satraps of barbarous nations,
who cheerfully welcomed and saluted him, sending embassies and presents,
and setting the highest value on his acquaintance and friendship;
insomuch that they honored him with pictures and statues in their
respective countries, and Constantine alone of all emperors was
acknowledged and celebrated by all. Notwithstanding, even among these
distant na<span id="page_484">p. 484</span> <span
id="iv.vi.i.viii-Page_484"></span>tions, he proclaimed the name of his
God in his royal edicts with all boldness.
