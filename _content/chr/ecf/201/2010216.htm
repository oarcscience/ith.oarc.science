<p class="c18"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p2"></A>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p2.1"></A>He</span> wrote also an epistle to the brethren in Egypt on Repentance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2142"></A><A HREF="#fn_2142"><FONT SIZE="1">2143</FONT></A>
 In this he sets forth what seemed proper to him in regard to those who had fallen, and he describes the classes of transgressions.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p4"></A>2. There is extant also a private letter on Repentance, which he wrote to Conon,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2143"></A><A HREF="#fn_2143"><FONT SIZE="1">2144</FONT></A>
 bishop of the parish of Hermopolis, and another of an admonitory&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2144"></A><A HREF="#fn_2144"><FONT SIZE="1">2145</FONT></A>
 character, to his flock at Alexandria. Among them also is the one written to Origen on Martyrdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2145"></A><A HREF="#fn_2145"><FONT SIZE="1">2146</FONT></A>
 and to the brethren at Laodicea,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2146"></A><A HREF="#fn_2146"><FONT SIZE="1">2147</FONT></A>
 of whom Thelymidres was bishop. He likewise sent one on Repentance to the brethren in Armenia,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2147"></A><A HREF="#fn_2147"><FONT SIZE="1">2148</FONT></A>
 of whom Merozanes was bishop.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p10"></A>3. Besides all these, he wrote to Cornelius of Rome, when he had received from him an epistle against Novatus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2148"></A><A HREF="#fn_2148"><FONT SIZE="1">2149</FONT></A>
 He states in this that he had been invited by Helenus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2149"></A><A HREF="#fn_2149"><FONT SIZE="1">2150</FONT></A>
 bishop of Tarsus, in Cilicia, and the others who were with him, Firmilianus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2150"></A><A HREF="#fn_2150"><FONT SIZE="1">2151</FONT></A>
 bishop in Cappadocia, and Theoctistus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2151"></A><A HREF="#fn_2151"><FONT SIZE="1">2152</FONT></A>
 of Palestine, to meet them at the synod in Antioch, where some persons were endeavoring to establish the schism of Novatus.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p15"></A>4. Besides this he writes that he had been informed that Fabius&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2152"></A><A HREF="#fn_2152"><FONT SIZE="1">2153</FONT></A>
 had fallen asleep, and that Demetrianus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2153"></A><A HREF="#fn_2153"><FONT SIZE="1">2154</FONT></A>
 had been appointed his successor in the episcopate of Antioch. He writes also in these words concerning the bishop of Jerusalem: &#8220;For the blessed Alexander&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2154"></A><A HREF="#fn_2154"><FONT SIZE="1">2155</FONT></A>
 having been confined in prison, passed away happily.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p19"></A>5. In addition to this there is extant also a certain other diaconal epistle of Dionysius, sent to those in Rome through Hippolytus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2155"></A><A HREF="#fn_2155"><FONT SIZE="1">2156</FONT></A>
 And he wrote <A NAME="page_292"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 292</FONT></A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-Page_292"></A>another to them on Peace, and likewise on Repentance;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2156"></A><A HREF="#fn_2156"><FONT SIZE="1">2157</FONT></A>
 and yet another to the confessors there who still held to the opinion of Novatus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2157"></A><A HREF="#fn_2157"><FONT SIZE="1">2158</FONT></A>
 He sent two more to the same persons after they had returned to the Church. And he communicated with many others by letters, which he has left behind him as a benefit in various ways to those who now diligently study his writings.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2158"></A><A HREF="#fn_2158"><FONT SIZE="1">2159</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p3"></A> This epistle on the subject of repentance or penance, which was the burning one just at this time in connection with the lapsed, was doubtless written at about the same time with those to Fabius and Novatian, already referred to. No fragments of it have been preserved.</p>

Eusebius preserves no extract from it, but extended fragments have been preserved in various <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p5.2"></A>mss.</span>, and have been published by Pitra (<i>Spic. Solesm.</i> I. p. 15 sq.), though it is questionable whether all that he gives are genuine. The translation of Dionysius&#146; works in the <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers</i> omits all of these fragments, though they are interesting and valuable. For further particulars, see Dittrich, p. 62. The general character of the letter must have been the same as that of the preceding.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2144"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2144">291:2145</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p5.3"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p6"></A> <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p6.1"></A>&#7952;</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p6.2"></A>&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8053;</span>; literally, &#8220;calculated to turn.&#8221; Musculus and Christophorsonus translate <i>hortatoria;</i> Valesius, <i>objurgatoria;</i> Stroth and Closs, &#8220;Ermahnungsschrift&#8221;; Crus&egrave;, &#8220;epistle of reproof.&#8221; The word does not necessarily carry the idea of reproof with it, but it is natural to suppose in the present case that it was written while Dionysius was absent from Alexandria, during the persecution of Decius, and if so, may well have contained an admonition to steadfastness, and at the same time, possibly, an argument against rigoristic measures which some of the people may have been advocating in reference to the lapsed. At least, the connection in which Eusebius mentions it might lead us to think that it had something to do with that question, though, as the epistle is no longer extant, we can reach no certainty in the matter.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2145"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2145">291:2146</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p6.3"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p7"></A> This epistle was doubtless written while Origen was suffering imprisonment in the persecution of Decius (see above, chap. 39, and below, p. 394), and was for the purpose of comforting and encouraging him (cf. Origen&#146;s own work on martyrdom, referred to in chap. 28, above). The epistle is no longer extant. Numerous fragments are given by Gallandi, Migne, and others, which they assign to this work; but Dittrich has shown (p. 35 sq.) that they are to be ascribed to some one else, perhaps to another Dionysius who lived much later than the great bishop.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2146"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2146">291:2147</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p7.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p8"></A> This epistle to the Laodiceans, which is no longer extant, very likely dealt, like so many of the others, with the question of discipline. Of Thelymidres, bishop of Laodicea, we know nothing.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2147"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2147">291:2148</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p8.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p9"></A> We know no more about this epistle to the Armenians than is told us here. The character of the letter must have been similar to the two upon the same subject mentioned above. Of the bishop Merozanes nothing is known.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2148"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2148">291:2149</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p10.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p11"></A> On Cornelius, see above, chap. 39, note. 3. His epistle to Dionysius is no longer extant. Dionysius&#146; epistle to him is likewise lost, and is known to us only from what Eusebius tells us here. It was written after the death of Fabius of Antioch (see below, &sect;4), and therefore probably in 253 (see above, chap. 39, note 7). It has been questioned whether this synod of Antioch to which, according to Eusebius, Dionysius referred, was really held, or only projected. The <i>Libellus Synodicus</i> records it as an actual synod, but its authority is of no weight. On the other hand, Eusebius&#146; words seem plainly to indicate that he believed that the council was really held, for he speaks of it as &#8220;<i>the</i> synod at Antioch&#8221;; had he thought of it only as projected, he could hardly have referred to it in such definite terms. In spite, therefore, of the doubts of Dittrich, Hefele, and others, I am inclined to believe that Eusebius supposed that the synod had actually been held in Antioch. Whether the epistle of Dionysius warranted him in drawing that conclusion is another question, which cannot be decided. I look upon it, however, as probable that, had the synod been simply projected and failed to convene, some indication of that fact would have been given by Dionysius, and would have caused a modification of Eusebius&#146; statement.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2149"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2149">291:2150</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p11.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p12"></A> Helenus, bishop of Tarsus, played a prominent part in the controversy concerning the re-baptism of heretics, maintaining, like most of the Oriental bishops, the necessity of re-baptizing them (see below, Bk. VII. chap. 5), and also in the controversy which arose about Paul of Samosata (see Bk. VII. chaps. 28 and 30). From the latter chapter we should gather that he presided at the final council in Antioch, which passed condemnation upon Paul, Firmilian, who seems to have presided at the previous councils, having died on his way to the last one. Of Helenus&#146; dates we know only what we can gather from the facts here stated. He must have been bishop as early as 252; and he cannot have died until after 265 (on the date of the Antiochian synod at which Paul was condemned, see Bk. VII. chap. 29, note 1).</p>
<A NAME="fn_2150"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2150">291:2151</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p12.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p13"></A> On Firmilian, see above, chap. 26, note 3.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2151"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2151">291:2152</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p13.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p14"></A> On Theoctistus, see above, chap. 19, note 27.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2152"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2152">291:2153</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p15.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p16"></A> On Fabius, bishop of Antioch, see above, chap. 39, note 7.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2153"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2153">291:2154</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p16.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p17"></A> Demetrianus, the successor of Fabius, and predecessor of Paul in the bishopric of Antioch, is mentioned also in Bk. VII. chaps. 5, 14, 27, and 30. The date of his accession is uncertain; but as Fabius died probably in 253 (possibly in 252), we can fix approximately the beginning of his episcopate. In Bk. VII. chaps. 5 and 14, he is said to have survived Gallienus&#146; edict of toleration (260 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p17.1"></A>a.d.</span>); but as Harnack has shown (<i>Zeit des Ignatius,</i> p. 51), this notice is quite unreliable, as are also the notices in the <i>Chronicle.</i> We can only say that his successor, Paul, became bishop between the years 257 and 260.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2154"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2154">291:2155</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p17.2"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p18"></A> On Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem, see above, chap. 8, note 6.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2155"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2155">291:2156</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p19.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p20"></A> The interpretation of this sentence is very difficult. The Greek runs <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.1"></A>&#7953;</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.2"></A>&#958;&#8134;&#962; &#964;&#945;&#8059;&#964;&#8131; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7953;&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945; &#964;&#953;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#955;&#8052; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#8190;&#929;&#8061;&#956;&#8131; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#916;&#953;&#959;&#957;&#965;&#963;&#8055;&#959;&#965; &#966;&#8051;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8052; &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#8190;&#921;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#8059;&#964;&#959;&#965;</span>. The <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.3"></A>&#966;&#8051;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>, according to the usage of Eusebius, must mean &#8220;is extant,&#8221; and some participle (e.g. &#8220;written&#8221; or &#8220;sent&#8221;) must then be supplied before <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.4"></A>&#948;&#953;&#8048; &#8190;&#921;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#955;&#8059;&#964;&#959;&#965;</span>. Whether Eusebius means that the letter was written by Hippolytus or was carried by him to Rome cannot be determined. The latter is more probable and is the commonly accepted interpretation. That Eusebius should name a messenger in this particular case and in no other seems peculiar, unless it be supposed that Hippolytus was so prominent a character as to merit especial mention. Who he was we do not know, for chronology will not permit us (as was formerly done by some scholars) to identify him with the great writer of the Roman church (see above, chaps. 20 and 22), and no other Hippolytus of prominence is known to us. In view of Eusebius&#146; mention of the name at this point, I am inclined, however, to think that he, knowing so little about the Roman Hippolytus, fancied that this was the same man. If he did, he had good reason to mention him. The word &#8220;diaconal&#8221; (<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.5"></A>&#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8052;</span>) in this sentence has caused much dispute. Rufinus translates <i>epistola de ministeriis;</i> Valesius, <i>epistola de officio diaconi,</i> that is, &#8220;concerning the office (or duties) of the diaconate,&#8221; and it seems out of the question to understand the word in any other way. Why Dionysius should address an epistle on this subject to the Roman church it is impossible to say. Magistris supposed that it was called &#8220;diaconal&#8221; because it was to be read in church by a deacon, and concluded that it was an exhortation to peace, since it was customary for the deacons to offer the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.6"></A>&#949;&#7984;&#961;&#951;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8364;</span>, or prayers for peace. The supposition is attractive, for it is natural to think that this epistle, like the others, discussed the Novatian schism and contained an exhortation to peace. But we cannot without further evidence adopt Magistris&#146; explanation, nor indeed can we assume that a diaconal epistle as such (whether the word is a technical one or not, and though it might seem such we have no other trace of such a use of it) had to do with the unity or peace of the Church. We must, in fact, leave the matter quite undetermined. Compare Dittrich, <i>ibid.</i> p. 55.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2156"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2156">292:2157</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p20.7"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p21"></A> Of these two epistles to the Romans we know only the titles, as given here by Eusebius.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2157"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2157">292:2158</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p21.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p22"></A> On these confessors, and their return to the Church, see above, chap. 43, note 9. Dionysius&#146; epistles to them are known to us only from Eusebius&#146; reference to them in this passage.</p>
<A NAME="fn_2158"></A><A HREF="2010216.htm#fr_2158">292:2159</A> <a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p22.1"></A>
<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xi.xlvi-p23"></A> Besides the epistles mentioned by Eusebius in this and the previous chapter we know at least the titles of a number of others. In Bk. VII. many are referred to, and extracts from some are quoted by Eusebius. See especially Bk. VII. chap. 26, where another partial list of them is given. Eusebius does not pretend to mention all of Dionysius&#146; epistles; indeed, he states that he wrote many besides those mentioned. For further particulars in regard to all the epistles known to us, see Dittrich&#146;s monograph.</p>
