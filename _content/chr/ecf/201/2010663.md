id="iv.vii.i-p7.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*Preliminary Remarks on the
Feast of Easter: and how the Word of God, having conferred Manifold
Benefits on Mankind, was betrayed by his Beneficiaries.*

<span id="iv.vii.i-p8"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.i-p8.1"></span>That</span> light which far outshines the day
and sun, first pledge of resurrection, and renovation of bodies long
since dissolved, <span id="fr_3365"></span>[3366](#fn_3365) the divine
token <span id="fr_3366"></span>[3367](#fn_3366) of promise, the path
which leads to everlasting life—in a word, the day of the Passion—is
arrived, best beloved doctors, and ye, my friends who are assembled
here, ye blessed multitudes, who worship him who is the author of all
worship, and praise him continually with heart and voice, according to
the precepts of his holy word. But thou, Nature, <span
id="fr_3367"></span>[3368](#fn_3367) parent of all things, what blessing
like to this hast thou ever accomplished for mankind? Nay rather, what
is in any sense thy workmanship, since he who formed the universe is
himself the author of thy being? For it is he who has arrayed thee in
thy beauty; and the beauty of Nature is life according to Nature’s laws.
But principles quite opposed to Nature have mightily prevailed; in that
men have agreed in withholding his rightful worship from the Lord of
all, believing that the order of the universe depended, not on his
providence, but, on the blind uncertainty of chance: and this
notwithstanding the clearest announcement of the truth by his inspired
prophets, whose words should have claimed belief, but were in every way
resisted by that impious wickedness which hates the light of truth, and
loves the obscure mazes of darkness. Nor was this error unaccompanied by
violence and cruelty, especially in that the will of princes encouraged
the blind impetuosity of the multitude, or rather itself led the way in
the career of reckless folly. Such principles as these, confirmed by the
practice of many generations, became the source of terrible evils in
those early times: but no sooner had the radiance of the Saviour’s
presence appeared, than justice took the place of wrong, a calm
succeeded the confusion of the storm, and the predictions of the
prophets were all fulfilled. For after he had enlightened the world by
the glorious discretion and purity of his character, and had ascended to
the mansions of his father’s house, he founded his Church on earth, as a
holy temple of virtue, an immortal, imperishable temple, wherein the
worship due to the Supreme Father and to himself should be piously
performed. But what did the insane malice of the nations hereupon
devise? Their effort was to reject the grace of Christ, and to ruin that
Church which was ordained for the salvation of all, though they thus
ensured the overthrow of their own superstition. <span
id="fr_3368"></span>[3369](#fn_3368) Once more then unholy sedition,
once more war and strife prevailed, with stiff-neckedness, luxurious
riot, and that craving for wealth which now soothes its victims with
specious hope, now strikes them with groundless fear; a craving which is
contrary to nature, and the very characteristic of Vice herself. Let
her, however, lie prostrate in the dust, and own the victorious power of
Virtue; and let her rend and tear herself, as well she may, in the
bitterness of repentance. But let us now proceed to speak of topics
which pertain to the Divine doctrine.
