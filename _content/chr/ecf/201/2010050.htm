<p class="c18"><a name="iii.vii.ix-p2"></A>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.ix-p2.1"></A>Caius</span> had held the power not quite four years,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">325</FONT></A>
 when he was succeeded by the emperor Claudius. Under him the world was visited with a famine,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_325"></A><A HREF="#fn_325"><FONT SIZE="1">326</FONT></A>
 which writers that are entire strangers to our religion have recorded in their histories.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_326"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">327</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii.ix-p3"></A> Caius ruled from March 16, <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.ix-p3.1"></A>a.d.</span> 37, to Jan. 24, <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.ix-p3.2"></A>a.d.</span> 41, and was succeeded by his uncle Claudius.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii.ix-p4"></A> Several famines occurred during the reign of Claudius (cf. Dion Cassius, LX. 11, Tacitus, <i>Annal.</i> XII. 13, and Eusebius, <i>Chron.,</i> year of Abr. 2070) in different parts of the empire, but no universal famine is recorded such as Eusebius speaks of. According to Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> XX. 2.5 and 5. 2), a severe famine took place in Judea while Cuspius Fadus and Tiberius Alexander were successively procurators. Fadus was sent into Judea upon the death of Agrippa (44 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.ix-p4.1"></A>a.d.</span>), and Alexander was succeeded by Cumanus in 48 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.vii.ix-p4.2"></A>a.d.</span> The exact date of Alexander&#146;s accession we do not know, but it took place probably about 45 or 46. This famine is without doubt the one referred to by Agabus in <a name="iii.vii.ix-p4.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028">Acts xi. 28</a><a name="iii.vii.ix-p4.4"></A>. The exact meaning of the word <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.vii.ix-p4.5"></A>&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;</span>, in that passage, is a matter of dispute. Whether it refers simply to Palestine, or is used to indicate a succession of famines in different parts of the world, or is employed only in a rhetorical sense, it is impossible to say. Eusebius understands the word in its widest sense, and therefore assumes a universal famine; but he is mistaken in his assumption.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii.ix-p5"></A> The only non-Christian historians, so far as we know, to record a famine during the reign of Claudius, are Dion Cassius and Tacitus, who mention a famine in Rome, and Josephus, who speaks of the famine in Judea (see the previous note for the references). Eusebius, in his <i>Chron.,</i> mentions famines both in Greece and in Rome during this reign, but upon what authority we do not know. As already remarked, we have no extant account of a general famine at this time.</p>
