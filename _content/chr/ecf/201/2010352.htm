<p class="c18"><a name="iv.iii.ii.i-p4"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.iii.ii.i-p4.1"></A>A man&#146;s</span> character consists of an inherited personality enlarged, modified, or disfigured by his own repeated voluntary acts. A sufficiently exhaustive survey of such character may be made under the rubrics of: 1. Inherited characteristics. 2. Physical characteristics. 3. Mental characteristics. 4. Moral characteristics. 5. Religious characteristics.</p>  
<p><a name="iv.iii.ii.i-p5"></A>The character of Constantine has been so endlessly treated, with such utter lack of agreement, that it seems hopeless to try to reach any clear results in a study of it. &#8220;Who shall decide when doctors disagree?&#8221; &#8220;How shall I go about it to find what sort of a man Constantine really was?&#8221; Certainly nothing can be gained by that method which chooses a few acts or characteristics to which shifting tests of various philosophies are applied. Nor can any haphazard selection and stringing together of traits give what is by its nature a synthesis of them all. Like any other scientific study, the first condition of method is that it be systematic. Then, a character generalization is worth just so much, no more, as the grounds on which it is based. To get a man&#146;s character from secondary sources, from other men&#146;s generalizations, is a hopelessly will-of-the-wisp effort. Again, another vice of characterization as usually practised is the interpretation of the whole by a part rather than the part by the whole. The individual act is thus made the standard of character. To get at what this personality called Constantine was therefore requires a systematic survey of the primary sources with a view to getting the <i>ensemble</i> that the eccentric may be judged by the normal. In such survey the main thing is the body of analyzed and grouped facts. The editor&#146;s summary, like any summary, is worth only what the facts are worth. This method, however imperfectly carried out, is at least better than rambling observations of incoherent phenomena; and has therefore been adopted in this attempt to find out what sort of a man this Constantine was; Physically, Mentally, Morally, Spiritually.</p>
