<span id="iv.vii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Chapter IV</span>.—*On the Error of
Idolatrous Worship.*

<span id="iv.vii.iv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.iv-p2.1"></span>Whatever</span> has had a beginning, has also
an end. Now that which is a beginning in respect of time, is called a
generation: and whatever is by generation is subject to corruption, and
its beauty <span id="fr_3382"></span>[3383](#fn_3382) is impaired by the
lapse of time. How, then, can they whose origin is from corruptible
generation, be immortal? Again, this supposition has gained credit with
the ignorant multitude, that marriages, and the birth of children, are
usual among the gods. Granting, then, such offspring to be immortal, and
continually produced, the race must of necessity multiply to excess: and
if this were so, where is the heaven, or the earth, which could contain
so vast and still increasing a multitude of gods? But what shall we say
of those men who represent these celestial beings as joined in
incestuous union with their sister goddesses, and charge them with
adultery and impurity? <span id="fr_3383"></span>[3384](#fn_3383) We
declare, further, with all confidence, that the very honors and worship
which these deities receive from men are accompanied by acts of
wantonness and profligacy. Once more; the experienced and skillful
sculptor, having formed the conception of his design, perfects his work
according to the rules of art; and in a little while, as if forgetful of
himself, idolizes his own creation, and adores it as an immortal god,
while yet he admits that himself, the author and maker of the image, is
a mortal man. Nay, they even show the graves and monuments of those whom
they deem immortal, and bestow divine honors on the dead: not knowing
that that which is truly blessed and incorruptible needs no distinction
which perishable men can give: for that Being, who is seen by the mental
eye, and conceived by the intellect alone, requires to be distinguished
by no external form, and admits no figure to represent its character and
likeness. But the honors of which we speak are given to those who have
yielded to the power of death: they once were men, and tenants, while
they lived, of a mortal body.
