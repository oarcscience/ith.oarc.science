for Peace.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxv-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxv-p2.1"></span>My</span> design then was, first, to bring
the diverse judgments formed by all nations respecting the Deity to a
condition, as it were, of settled uniformity; and, secondly, to restore
to health the system of the world, then suffering under the malignant
power of a grievous distemper. Keeping these objects in view, I sought
to accomplish the one by the secret eye of thought, while the other I
tried to rectify by the power of military authority. For I was aware
that, if I should succeed in establishing, according to my hopes, a
common harmony of sentiment among all the servants of God, the general
course of affairs would also experience a change correspondent to the
pious desires of them all.
