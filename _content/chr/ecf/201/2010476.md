<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxi-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXI</span>.—*Release likewise
granted to Exiles in the Islands.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xxxi-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xxxi-p2.1"></span>Furthermore</span>, it is our command
that all those who have been detained in the islands against their will
should receive the benefit of this present provision; in order that they
who till now have been surrounded by rugged mountains and the encircling
barrier of the ocean, being now set free from that gloomy and desolate
solitude, may fulfill their fondest wish by revisiting their dearest
friends. Those, too, who have prolonged a miserable life in the midst of
abject and wretched squalor, welcoming their restoration as an
unlooked-for gain, and discarding henceforth all anxious thoughts, may
pass their lives with us in freedom from all fear. For that any one
could live in a state of fear under our government, when we boast and
believe ourselves to be the servants of God, would surely be a thing
most extraordinary even to hear of, and quite incredible; and our
mission is to rectify the errors of the others.
