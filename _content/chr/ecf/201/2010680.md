<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*Of the Erythræan
Sibyl, who pointed in a Prophetic Acrostic at our Lord and his Passion.
The Acrostic is “Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour, Cross.”*

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vii.xviii-p2.1"></span>My</span> desire, however, is to derive
even from foreign sources a testimony to the Divine nature of Christ.
For on such testimony it is evident that even those who blaspheme his
name must acknowledge that he is God, and the Son of God if indeed they
will accredit the words of those whose sentiments coincided with their
own. <span id="fr_3457"></span>[3458](#fn_3457) The Erythræan Sibyl,
then, who herself assures us that she lived in the sixth generation
after the flood, was a priestess of Apollo, who wore the sacred fillet
in imitation of the God she served, who guarded also the tripod
encompassed with the serpent’s folds, and returned prophetic answers to
those who approached her shrine; having been devoted by the folly of her
parents to this service, a service productive of nothing good or noble,
but only of indecent fury, such as we find recorded in the case of
Daphne. <span id="fr_3458"></span>[3459](#fn_3458) On one occasion,
however, having rushed into the sanctuary of her vain superstition, she
became really filled with inspiration from above, and declared in
prophetic verses the future purposes of God; plainly indicating the
advent of Jesus by the initial letters of these verses, forming an
acrostic in these words: <span class="c13"><span
id="iv.vii.xviii-p4.1"></span>Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour,
Cross</span>. The verses themselves are as follows:

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p5"></span>Judgment! Earth’s oozing pores <span
id="fr_3459"></span>[3460](#fn_3459) shall mark the day;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p7"></span>Earth’s heavenly king his glories
shall display:

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p8"></span>Sovereign of all, exalted on his
throne,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p9"></span>Unnumbered multitudes their God shall
own;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p10"></span>Shall see their Judge, with mingled
joy and fear,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p11"></span>Crowned with his saints, in human
form appear.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p12"></span>How vain, while desolate earth’s
glories lie,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p13"></span>Riches, and pomp, and man’s idolatry!

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p14"></span>In that dread hour, when Nature’s
fiery doom

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p15"></span>Startles the slumb’ring tenants of
the tomb,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p16"></span>Trembling all flesh shall stand; each
secret wile,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p17"></span>Sins long forgotten, thoughts of
guilt and guile,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p18"></span>Open beneath God’s searching light
shall lie:

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p19"></span>No refuge then, but hopeless agony.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p20"></span>O’er heaven’s expanse shall gathering
shades of night

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p21"></span>From earth, sun, stars, and moon,
withdraw their light;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p22"></span>God’s arm shall crush each mountain’s
towering pride;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p23"></span>On ocean’s plain no more shall navies
ride.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p24"></span>Dried at the source, no river’s
rushing sound

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p25"></span>Shall soothe, no fountain slake the
parched ground.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p26"></span>Around, afar, shall roll the
trumpet’s blast,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p27"></span>Voice of wrath long delayed, revealed
at last.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p28"></span>In speechless awe, while earth’s
foundations groan,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p29"></span>On judgment’s seat earth’s kings
their God shall own.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p30"></span><span id="page_575">p. 575</span>
<span id="iv.vii.xviii-Page_575"></span>Uplifted then, in majesty
divine,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p31"></span>Radiant with light, behold
Salvation’s Sign!

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p32"></span>Cross of that Lord, who, once for
sinners given,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p33"></span>Reviled by man, now owned by earth
and heaven,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p34"></span>O’er every land extends his iron
sway.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p35"></span>Such is the name these mystic lines
display;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p36"></span>Saviour, eternal king, who bears our
sins away. <span id="fr_3460"></span>[3461](#fn_3460)

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p84"></span>It is evident that the virgin uttered
these verses under the influence of Divine inspiration. And I cannot but
esteem her blessed, whom the Saviour thus selected to unfold his
gracious purpose towards us.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p37"></span> \[It can scarcely be necessary to
observe that the acrostic, the general sense of which has been aimed at
in the above translation, must be regarded as the pious fiction of some
writer, whose object was to recommend the truth of Christianity to
heathens by an appeal to the authority of an (alleged) ancient heathen
prophecy.—*Bag.*\] The quotation is found in the edition of Alexandre,
Bk. VIII. ch. 219–250. (Cf. translation in Augustin, *[De
civ.](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#000)<span
id="iv.vii.xviii-p37.1"></span> Dei.*) The translation of *Bag.,* giving
the “general sense” and reproducing the acrostic, stands unchanged. The
translation of 1709, much more vigorous and suggestive of the “Dies
Iræ,” is as follows:

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p38"></span>“When the Great Day of Judgment shall
appear,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p39"></span>The melting Earth shall then dissolve
with fear;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p40"></span>A King Immortal shall from Heav’n
descend,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p41"></span>At whose Tribunal the whole world
attend.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p42"></span>Both Just and Wicked shall, when Time
grows old,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p43"></span>Their mighty God in flesh array’d
behold;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p44"></span>Armies of Saints on His Right hand
shall come,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p45"></span>Whilst Humane Souls expect their
final doom.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p46"></span>Th’ Universe shall be a dry, Barren
Strand,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p47"></span>And Thorns shall flourish on the
scorched land;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p48"></span>Men shall with indignation cast away

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p49"></span>Their Wealth and Idols in that
dreadful day.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p50"></span>The parching Earth, and Heaven in
flames shall fry,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p51"></span>And searching fire drain the Ocean
dry:

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p52"></span>All flesh which in the Grave
imprison’d lay,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p53"></span>Shake off their Fetters, and return
to Day.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p54"></span>Fire ’twixt Good and Bad shall
diff’rence make,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p55"></span>And filthy Dross from purer Metal
take.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p56"></span>Man’s secret Deeds shall all be open
lay’d,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p57"></span>And th’ obscure Mazes of their Hearts
displayed;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p58"></span>Gnashing their Teeth, they shall
their Fate bewail:

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p59"></span>The stars harmonious dance, and th’
Sun shall fail.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p60"></span>The Orbs roll’d up, shrink into
darkest night,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p61"></span>The Labouring Moon shall lose her
borrowed light.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p62"></span>Mountains with Plains on the same
Level lye;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p63"></span>Vallies shall gape no more, nor Hills
be high.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p64"></span>On the proud Billows Ships shall ride
no more:

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p65"></span>And Lightning the Earth’s Face shall
shrivel sore.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p66"></span>The crackling Rivers with fierce Fire
shall burn,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p67"></span>Which shall their streams to solid
Crystal turn.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p68"></span>The Heav’nly Trump shall blow a
doleful sound,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p69"></span>And th’ world’s destruction, and its
sin resound.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p70"></span>The yawning Earth Hell’s vast Abyss
shall shew;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p71"></span>All Kings before God’s just Tribunal
go.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p72"></span>Then Liquid Sulphur from the Sky
shall stream,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p73"></span>God shall pour down Rivers of
vengeful flame;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p74"></span>All men shall then the Glorious Cross
descry,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p75"></span>That wished-for sign unto a faithful
eye:

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p76"></span>The Life of pious Souls, their chief
delight;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p77"></span>To Sinners an Offence, a dismal
sight!

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p78"></span>Enlightening the called with its
beams,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p79"></span>When cleansed from sin in twice six
limpid streams.

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p80"></span>His Empire shall be boundless, and
that God

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p81"></span>Shall Rule the Wicked with an Iron
Rod;

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p82"></span>This God, Immortal King, describ’d in
Verse,

<span id="iv.vii.xviii-p83"></span>Our Saviour, dying, shall man’s doom
Reverse.”
