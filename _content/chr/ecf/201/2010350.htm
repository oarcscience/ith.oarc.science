<p><a name="iv.iii.i.ix-p2"></A>Later in this year, Constantine is known to have been at Jerusalem, where he dedicated a church (<i>V. C.</i> 4. 40; Chron. Pasch., but wrong year). It was also the year of the Synods of Tyre (Athanas. <i>c. Ar.</i> 1. p. 788; <i>V. C.</i> 4. 41; Theod. 1. 28). The same year, or early in the following one, Eusebius pronounced his tricennial oration (see <i>Special Prolegomena</i>). In 337 the Great Emperor died at Ancyrona, near Nicomedia, just as he was preparing for an expedition against the Persians, and was buried in the Church of the Apostles, at Constantinople (cf. notes on Eusebius&#146; Life of Constantine).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3038"></A><A HREF="#fn_3038"><FONT SIZE="1">3039</FONT></A>
