<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p2"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="iii.xiv.vi-p2.1"></span>About</span> the same time, in the city of
Tyre, a youth named Ulpianus, <span id="fr_2649"></span>[2650](#fn_2649)
after dreadful tortures and most severe scourgings, was enclosed in a
raw oxhide, with a dog and with one of those poisonous reptiles, an asp,
and cast into the sea. Wherefore I think that we may properly mention
him in connection with the martyrdom of Apphianus.

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p4"></span>2. Shortly afterwards, Ædesius, <span
id="fr_2650"></span>[2651](#fn_2650) a brother of Apphianus, not only in
God, but also in the flesh, being a son of the same earthly father,
endured sufferings like his, after very many confessions and protracted
tortures in bonds, and after he had been sentenced by the governor to
the mines in Palestine. He conducted himself through them all in a truly
philosophic manner; for he was more highly educated than his brother,
and had prosecuted philosophic studies.

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p6"></span>3. Finally in the city of Alexandria,
when he beheld the judge, who was trying the Christians, offending
beyond all bounds, now insulting holy men in various ways, and again
consigning women of greatest modesty and even religious virgins to
procurers for shameful treatment, he acted like his brother. For as
these things seemed insufferable, he went forward with bold resolve, and
with his words and deeds overwhelmed the judge with shame and disgrace.
After suffering in consequence many forms of torture, he endured a death
similar to his brother’s, being cast into the sea. But these things, as
I have said, happened to him in this way a little later.

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p3"></span> The martyrdom of Ulpian is omitted in
the Syriac version. It was apparently a later addition, made when the
abridgment of the longer version was produced; and this perhaps accounts
for the brevity of the notice and the words of explanation with which
the mention of him is concluded.
