<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxix-p1"></span> <span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXIX</span>.—*Origin of the
Controversy between Alexander and Arius, and that these Questions ought
not to have been discussed.*

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.lxix-p2.1"></span>I understand</span>, then, that the
origin of the present controversy is this. When you, Alexander, demanded
of the presbyters what opinion they severally maintained respecting a
certain passage in the Divine law, <span
id="fr_3215"></span>[3216](#fn_3215) or rather, I should say, that you
asked them something connected with an unprofitable question, then you,
Arius, inconsiderately insisted on <span
id="fr_3216"></span>[3217](#fn_3216) what ought never to have been
conceived at all, or if conceived, should have been buried in profound
silence. Hence it was that a dissension arose between you, fellowship
was withdrawn, <span id="fr_3217"></span>[3218](#fn_3217) and <span
id="page_517">p. 517</span> <span id="iv.vi.ii.lxix-Page_517"></span>the
holy people, rent into diverse parties, no longer preserved the unity of
the one body. Now, therefore, do ye both exhibit an equal degree of
forbearance, <span id="fr_3218"></span>[3219](#fn_3218) and receive the
advice which your fellow-servant righteously gives. What then is this
advice? It was wrong in the first instance to propose such questions as
these, or to reply to them when propounded. For those points of
discussion which are enjoined by the authority of no law, but rather
suggested by the contentious spirit which is fostered by misused
leisure, even though they may be intended merely as an intellectual
exercise, ought certainly to be confined to the region of our own
thoughts, and not hastily produced in the popular assemblies, nor
unadvisedly intrusted to the general ear. For how very few are there
able either accurately to comprehend, or adequately to explain subjects
so sublime and abstruse in their nature? Or, granting that one were
fully competent for this, how many people will he convince? Or, who,
again, in dealing with questions of such subtle nicety as these, can
secure himself against a dangerous declension from the truth? It is
incumbent therefore on us in these cases to be sparing of our words,
lest, in case we ourselves are unable, through the feebleness of our
natural faculties, to give a clear explanation of the subject before us,
or, on the other hand, in case the slowness of our hearers’
understandings disables them from arriving at an accurate apprehension
of what we say, from one or other of these causes the people be reduced
to the alternative either of blasphemy or schism.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxix-p3"></span> \[The word <span class="Greek"><span

Eusebius as a general term for Divine revelation; as we employ the word
“Scripture.”—*Bag.*\]

<span id="iv.vi.ii.lxix-p4"></span> The plain English “stuck to”
represents the idea of Heinichen (*animo infixisses infixumque teneres*)
followed by *Molz* (*mit unkluger Hartnäckigkeit festhieltest*). *Bag.*
had “gave utterance to,” and with this *Vales., 1709,* and *Str.*
correspond.
