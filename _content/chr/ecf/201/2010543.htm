<p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xxiv-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xxiv-p2.1"></A>But</span> besides these, his writings are very numerous on kindred subjects, and he was the author of a multitude of letters, some to the bishops, in which he laid injunctions on them tending to the advantage of the churches of God; and sometimes the thrice blessed one addressed the people of the churches generally, calling them his own brethren and fellow-servants. But perhaps we may hereafter find leisure to collect these despatches in a separate form, in order that the integrity of our present history may not be impaired by their insertion.</p>
