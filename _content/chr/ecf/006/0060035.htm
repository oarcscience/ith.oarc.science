<p>Apocalypse, note 7, p. 105, and note 9, p. 106.</p>  
<p>The moderation of Dionysius is hardly less conspicuous than his fearlessness of inquiry. in the questions he raises about the Apocalypse.<sup><a href="footnote/fn18.htm#P1863_547763">151</a></sup> He utterly refuses to reject it.<sup><a href="footnote/fn18.htm#P1864_547818">152</a></sup> He testifies to the value set upon it by his fellow-Christians. Only, he doubts as to (<i>the</i> John) the "inspired person" who was its author, and with critical skill exposes the inferiority of the Greek of the Apocalypse to that of the Gospel and Epistles of St. John. Obviously he accepts it as part of the canon, only doubting as to the author. Modestly he owns that it passes his understanding. So Calvin forbore to comment upon it, and owned to "headache" when he came to it. </p>
