<SUP>1 </SUP>As interpreted by Anastasius Bibliothecarius. Apud Maium, <I>Spioilegii</I>, tom. iii. p. 671. That Anastasius Bibliothecarius translated from the Greek the <I>Passion</I> of St. Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, is affirmed by Anastasius himself in his prologue, <I>Ad Passionem Martyrum</I>, MCCCCLXXX., published by Mabillon in the <I>Museum Italicum</I>, tom. i. part ii, p. 80: "Post translatam a me ad petitionem sanctitatis tunae (he is addressing Peter, Bishop of Gavinum), passionem praecipui doctoris et martyris, Petri Alexandrinae urbis episcopi." And then an anonymous biographer of John viii., in <I>Muratori R. I. S.</I>, tom. iii. p. i. p. 269, confirms the same. Anastasius, the librarian of the Roman church, translated from the Greek into Latin the <I>Passion</I> of St. Peter, Archbishop of Alexandria. But it is a matter of conjecture which of the different <I>Passions</I> of St. Peter Anastasius translated. Of the Acts of St. Peter, there are three different records:-(1) <I>Acta Sincera</I>, which, according to Baronius, are the most genuine. (2) A shorter Latin version, by Surius. (3) A Greek version, by Combefis.</P>

<SUP>6 </SUP>[Anastasius, <I>more Romano</I>, uses the Middle-Age terminology as if it had existed in the Ante-Nicene period. So all the successors of the apostles at Rome, including St. Peter himself, are transformed into "Popes." We owe this abuse to the "False Decretals," of which we treat hereafter. But why is exploded fiction and demonstrated untruth perpetuated by enlightened historians? See vol. v. p. 155.] </P>

<SUP>13 </SUP><FONT FACE='SPIonic'>kolo/bion</FONT>-this is the tunicle, tunica, tunicella, dalmatica. It originally had no sleeves; it is said that wide sleeves were added in the West about the fourth century; and the garment was then called dalmatic, and was the deacon's vestment when assisting at the holy communion; while that worn by sub-deacons, called by the Anglo-Saxons "roc", and "tunicle" generally after the 13th century, was of the same form, but smaller and less ornamented (Palmer, <I>Orig. Liturgicae</I>, vol. ii. p. 314). The word, in its classical use, meant an under-garment with its sleeves curtailed (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>kolobo/j</FONT>)-i.e., reaching only half down to the elbow, or entirely without sleeves. [But the reference here is clearly to St. John xix. 23; and the introduction of the mediaeval <I>dalmatic</I>, to translate <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>kolo/bion</FONT>, is out of place.] </P>

<SUP>27 </SUP>[Probably he wore <I>ordinarily</I> what afterwards became an ecclesiastical ornament. So the <I>casula</I> and other vestments were retained by the clergy after they ceased to be commonly worn. Marriott, <I>Vestiar. Christian.</I>, p. 198.] The <I>omophorion</I>, which is worn by every Eastern bishop, resembles the Latin pallium, except that it is broader, and tied round the neck in a knot. <I>Cf.</I> following passage from Neale's <I>Introduction to the Translation of the Eastern Liturgies</I>: "But while the Gospel is being read, the bishop lays aside his <I>omophorion</I>, thereby making profession of his service to the Lord. For since it is the Lord who is represented as speaking by the Gospel, and is, as it were, Himself present, the bishop at that time ventures not to be arrayed with the symbol of His incarnation-I mean, the <I>omophorion</I>, but taking it off from his shoulders, he gives it to the deacon, who holds it folded in his right hand, himself standing near the bishop, and preceding the holy gifts. When he has finished the liturgy, and comes to the communion, he again assumes the <I>omophorion</I>, manifesting that before this he was one of the ministers, and was afraid to put upon himself that holy garment. But when the work is accomplished, and he goes on to elevate the bread, and to divide it into parts, and to receive it himself, and distribute it to others, it is necessary that he should put on all the sacred symbols of his dignity; and since the <I>omophorion</I> is the principal vest of a pontiff, he necessarily assumes that, and in that is partaker of the most divine things." [All this unknown to antiquity.]</P>
