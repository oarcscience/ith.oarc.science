<span id="P5106_1538776"></span> <sup>82</sup> Commentators have
remarked the allusion to Phil. iii. 11. See Migne's note. The thought of

the Church, at the second Advent, when "the dead shall be raised," was
obviously present to the mind of the writer.

<span id="P5110_1539668"></span> <sup>83</sup> Jer. ii. 32. The author,

almost a command, instead of a question. The original has e0pilh/setai;
in the text it is e0pilaqe/sqai.

<span id="P5161_1556268"></span> <sup>22</sup> Heb. x. 1. The apostle
