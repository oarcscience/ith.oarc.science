<SUP>55 </SUP>In the second chapter of the seventh book of his <I>Ecclesiastical History</I>, Eusebius says: "To this Stephen, Eusebius wrote the first of his epistles on the matter of baptism." And he calls this the <I>first</I>, because Dionysius also wrote other four epistles to Xystus and Dionysius, two of the successors of Stephen, and to Philemon, on the same subject of the baptizing of heretics.-Gallandi.</P>

<P><A NAME="P1703_491744"></A>
<SUP>56 </SUP>Eusebius introduces the letter thus: "When he had addressed many reasonings on this subject to him (Stephen) by letter, Dionysius at last showed him that, as the persecution had abated, the churches in all parts opposed to the innovations of Novatus were at peace among themselves." [See vol. v. p. 275.]</P>

<SUP>58 </SUP>Baronius infers from this epistle that at this date, about 259 A.D., the Oriental bishops had given up their "error," and fallen in with Stephen's opinion, that heretics did not require to be rebaptized,-an inference, however, which Valesius deems false. [Undoubtedly so.] </P>

<SUP>59 </SUP>The name assigned by the pagans to Jerusalem was Aelia. It was so called even in Constantine's time as we see in the <I>Tabula Peutingerorum</I> and the <I>Itinerarium Antonini</I>, written after Constantine's reign. In the seventh canon of the Nicene Council we also find the name Aelia. [Given by Hadrian A.D. 135.]</P>

To this effect we have the statement of Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, in his Epistle to Soter, which Eusebius cites in his fourth book. In the same passage, Eusebius also remarks that this commendable custom had been continued in the Roman church up to his own time; and with that object collections were made there, of which Leo Magnus writes in his <I>Sermones</I>.-Vales. [Note this to the eternal honour of this See in its early purity.]</P>

<SUP>77 </SUP>There was a body of men called <I>frumentarii milites</I>, employed under the emperors as secret spies, and sent through the provinces to look after accused persons, and collect floating rumors. They were abolished at length by Constantine, as Aurelius Victor writes. They were subordinate to the judges or governors of the provinces.

<SUP>88 </SUP>Germanus had accused Dionysius of neglecting to hold the assemblies of the brethren before the persecutions broke out, and of rather providing for his own safety by flight. For when persecution burst on them, the bishops were wont first to convene the people, in order to exhort them to hold fast the faith of Christ; there infants and catechumens were baptized, to provide against their departing this life without baptism, and the Eucharist was given to the faithful.-Vales.</P>

Thus a certain poet of note in the times of Anastasius, belonging to the Thebaid, was so named, as Suidas informs us. There was also a Coluthus, a certain schismatic, in Egypt, in the times of Athanasius, who is mentioned often in the <I>Apologia</I>; and Gregory of Nyssa names him Acoluthus in his <I>Contra Eunomium</I>, book ii.-Vales. </P>

<SUP>94 </SUP><FONT FACE='SPIonic'>kata\ meroj sunagwgai</FONT>. When the suburbs were somewhat distant from the city, the brethren resident in them were not compelled to attend the meetings of the larger church, but had meetings of their own in a basilica, or some building suitable for the purpose. The Greeks, too, gave the name <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>proa/steion</FONT> to places at some considerable distance from the city, as well as to suburbs immediately connected with it. Thus Athanasius calls Canopus a <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>proa/steion</FONT>; and so Daphne is spoken of as the <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>proa/steion</FONT> of Antioch, Achyrona as that of Nicomedia, and Septimum as that of Constantinople, though these places were distant some miles from the cities. From this place it is also inferred that in the days of Dionysius there was still but one church in Alexandria, where all the brethren met for devotions. But in the time of Athanasius, when several churches had been built by the various bishops, the Alexandrians met in different places, <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>kata me/roj kai dih|rhme/nwj</FONT>, as Athanasius says in his first Apology to Constantius; only that on the great festivals, as at the paschal season and at Pentecost, the brethren did not meet separately, but all in the larger church, as Athanasius also shows us-Vales.</P>

<SUP>104 </SUP>He means the Emperor Philip who, as many of the ancients have recorded, was the first of the Roman emperors to profess the Christian religion.

It is to be noted further, that Dionysius says of these emperors only that <I>they were said</I> and thought to be Christians, not that they were so in reality.-Gallandi </P>
