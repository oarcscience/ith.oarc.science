Methodius condemns is probably the true one, as it is certainly the most
natural.-Tr. \[It is certainly worth observing, that Methodius has on
his side a strong following among the ancients; the interpretation the
translator favours having little support save among modern defenders of
the late pontiff's bull *Ineffabilis.* Elucidation II.\]
