<span id="P4249_1245453"></span> <sup>1</sup> As interpreted by
Anastasius Bibliothecarius. Apud Maium, *Spioilegii*, tom. iii. p. 671.
That Anastasius Bibliothecarius translated from the Greek the *Passion*
of St. Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, is affirmed by Anastasius himself in
his prologue, *Ad Passionem Martyrum*, MCCCCLXXX., published by Mabillon
in the *Museum Italicum*, tom. i. part ii, p. 80: "Post translatam a me
ad petitionem sanctitatis tunae (he is addressing Peter, Bishop of
Gavinum), passionem praecipui doctoris et martyris, Petri Alexandrinae
urbis episcopi." And then an anonymous biographer of John viii., in
*Muratori R. I. S.*, tom. iii. p. i. p. 269, confirms the same.
Anastasius, the librarian of the Roman church, translated from the Greek
into Latin the *Passion* of St. Peter, Archbishop of Alexandria. But it
is a matter of conjecture which of the different *Passions* of St. Peter
Anastasius translated. Of the Acts of St. Peter, there are three
different records:-(1) *Acta Sincera*, which, according to Baronius, are
the most genuine. (2) A shorter Latin version, by Surius. (3) A Greek
version, by Combefis.

Ante-Nicene period. So all the successors of the apostles at Rome,
including St. Peter himself, are transformed into "Popes." We owe this
abuse to the "False Decretals," of which we treat hereafter. But why is
exploded fiction and demonstrated untruth perpetuated by enlightened
historians? See vol. v. p. 155.\]

tunicle, tunica, tunicella, dalmatica. It originally had no sleeves; it
is said that wide sleeves were added in the West about the fourth
century; and the garment was then called dalmatic, and was the deacon's
vestment when assisting at the holy communion; while that worn by
sub-deacons, called by the Anglo-Saxons "roc", and "tunicle" generally
after the 13th century, was of the same form, but smaller and less
ornamented (Palmer, *Orig. Liturgicae*, vol. ii. p. 314). The word, in
its classical use, meant an under-garment with its sleeves curtailed
(kolobo/j)-i.e., reaching only half down to the elbow, or entirely
without sleeves. \[But the reference here is clearly to St. John xix.
23; and the introduction of the mediaeval *dalmatic*, to translate
kolo/bion, is out of place.\]

*ordinarily* what afterwards became an ecclesiastical ornament. So the
*casula* and other vestments were retained by the clergy after they
ceased to be commonly worn. Marriott, *Vestiar. Christian.*, p. 198.\]
The *omophorion*, which is worn by every Eastern bishop, resembles the
Latin pallium, except that it is broader, and tied round the neck in a
knot. *Cf.* following passage from Neale's *Introduction to the
Translation of the Eastern Liturgies*: "But while the Gospel is being
read, the bishop lays aside his *omophorion*, thereby making profession
of his service to the Lord. For since it is the Lord who is represented
as speaking by the Gospel, and is, as it were, Himself present, the
bishop at that time ventures not to be arrayed with the symbol of His
incarnation-I mean, the *omophorion*, but taking it off from his
shoulders, he gives it to the deacon, who holds it folded in his right
hand, himself standing near the bishop, and preceding the holy gifts.
When he has finished the liturgy, and comes to the communion, he again
assumes the *omophorion*, manifesting that before this he was one of the
ministers, and was afraid to put upon himself that holy garment. But
when the work is accomplished, and he goes on to elevate the bread, and
to divide it into parts, and to receive it himself, and distribute it to
others, it is necessary that he should put on all the sacred symbols of
his dignity; and since the *omophorion* is the principal vest of a
pontiff, he necessarily assumes that, and in that is partaker of the
most divine things." \[All this unknown to antiquity.\]
