##  TRANSLATOR'S BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE.

\[a.d. 300.\] Of this Theonas we know extremely little.
Eusebius<sup>[1](footnote/fn28.htm#P2851_746699)</sup> tells us that
Maximus, who had held the episcopal office at Alexandria for eighteen
years after the death of Dionysius, was succeeded by Theonas. That
bishopric, we also learn, he held for nineteen years. His date is fixed
as from about 282 to 300 a.d. The only thing of his that has come down
to our time is his letter to Lucianus, the chief
chamberlain,<sup>[2](footnote/fn28.htm#P2852_747086)</sup> and a person
in high favour with the emperor. This epistle, which is a letter of
advice to that individual on the duties of his office, was first
published in the *Spicilegium* of Dacherius, and again in Gallandi's
*Bibliotheca*. The name of the emperor is not given, neither does the
letter itself tell us who the Bishop Theonas was who wrote it. Hence
some have, without much reason, supposed another Theonas, bishop of
Cyzicus, as the author. And some, such as Cave, have thought the emperor
in question was Constantius Chlorus. But the whole circumstances suit
Diocletian best.<sup>[3](footnote/fn28.htm#P2853_747699)</sup> Some
infer from the diction of the epistle, as we have it, that it is a
translation from a Greek original.
