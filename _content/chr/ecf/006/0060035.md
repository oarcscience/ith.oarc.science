##  Elucidations.

I

Apocalypse, note 7, p. 105, and note 9, p. 106.

The moderation of Dionysius is hardly less conspicuous than his
fearlessness of inquiry. in the questions he raises about the
Apocalypse.<sup>[151](footnote/fn18.htm#P1863_547763)</sup> He utterly
refuses to reject it.<sup>[152](footnote/fn18.htm#P1864_547818)</sup> He
testifies to the value set upon it by his fellow-Christians. Only, he
doubts as to (*the* John) the "inspired person" who was its author, and
with critical skill exposes the inferiority of the Greek of the
Apocalypse to that of the Gospel and Epistles of St. John. Obviously he
accepts it as part of the canon, only doubting as to the author.
Modestly he owns that it passes his understanding. So Calvin forbore to
comment upon it, and owned to "headache" when he came to it.
