##  III.-From the Acts of the Disputation Conducted by Malchion Against Paul of Samosata.<sup>[1](footnote/fn31.htm#P3173_812685)</sup>

------------

The compound is surely made tip of the simple
elements,<sup>[2](footnote/fn31.htm#P3176_812791)</sup> even as in the
instance of Jesus Christ, who was made one (person), constituted by God
the Word, and a human body which is of the seed of David, and who
subsists without having any manner of division between the two, but in
unity. You, however, appear to me to decline to admit a
constitution<sup>[3](footnote/fn31.htm#P3177_813185)</sup> after this
fashion: to the effect that there is not in this person, the Son of God
according to substance, but only the Wisdom according to participation.
For you made this assertion, that the Wisdom bears dispensing, and
therefore cannot be
compounded;<sup>[4](footnote/fn31.htm#P3178_813479)</sup> and you do not
consider that the divine Wisdom remained undiminished, even as it was
before it evacuated
itself;<sup>[5](footnote/fn31.htm#P3179_813610)</sup> and thus in this
self-evacuation, which it took upon itself in compassion (for us), it
continued undiminished and unchangeable. And this assertion you also
make, that the Wisdom dwelt in Him, just as we also dwell in houses, the
one in the other,<sup>[6](footnote/fn31.htm#P3180_814112)</sup> and yet
not as if we formed a part of the house, or the house a part of us.
