</p>   <h2 align="CENTER"><a></a> Introductory Notice to Anatolius and Minor Writers</h2>  
<p>------------</p>  
<p>Instead of reprinting a disjointed mass of "Fragments," I have thought it desirable to present them in a group, illustrative of the Alexandrian school. I give to anatolius the deserved place of prominece, marking him as the meed successor of Africanus in ability if not in the nature of his pursuits. His writing and the testimony of Eusebius prove him to have been a star of no inferior magnitude, even in the brilliant constellation of faith and genius of which he is part.</p>  
<p>These minor writers I have arranged, not with exclusive reference to minute chronology, but with some respect to their material, as follows:-</p>    <ul>
<p>i. Anatolius, a.d. 270</p>    
<p>i. Alexander of Cappadocia, a.d. 270</p>    
<p>i. Theognostus, a.d. 270</p>    
<p>i. Pierius, a.d. 270</p>    
<p>i. Theonas, a.d. 270</p>    
<p>i. Phileas, a.d. 270</p>    </ul>
<p>i. Pamphilus, a.d. 270</p>
