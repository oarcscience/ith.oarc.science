##  Elucidations.

These "*twelve anathemas*," as they are called, do evidently refute the
Nestorians and later heretics. Evidently, therefore, we must assign this
document to another author. And, as frequent references are made to such
tests, I subjoin a list of Oecumenical or Catholic Councils, properly so
called, as follows:-

7\. Constantinople (III.), "*Monothelitism*
(6),<sup>[45](footnote/fn10.htm#P1044_263481)</sup> a.d.
680.<sup>[46](footnote/fn10.htm#P1045_263729)</sup>

These are all *the undisputed* councils. The *Seventh Council*, so
called (a.d. 537), was not a free council, and was rejected by a free
council of the West, convened at Frankfort a.d. 794. Its acceptance by
the Roman pontiffs, subsequently, should have no logical force with the
Easterns, who do not recognise their supremacy even over the councils of
the West; and no free council has ever been held under pontifical
authority. The above list, therefore, is a complete list of all the
councils of the undivided Church as defined by Catholic canons. There
has been no possibility of a *Catholic* council since the division of
East and West. The Council of Frankfort is the pivot of subsequent
history, and its fundamental importance has not been sufficiently
insisted upon.
