<span id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p2"></span>That deep things ought not to be
preached at all to weak souls.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p3"></span>But the preacher should know how to
avoid drawing the mind of his hearer beyond its strength, lest, so to
speak, the string of the soul, when stretched more than it can bear,
should be broken.  For all deep things should be covered up before a
multitude of hearers, and scarcely opened to a few.  For hence the Truth
in person says, *Who, thinkest thou, is the faithful and wise steward,
whom his <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p3.1"></span>Lord</span> has appointed over his
household, to give them their measure of wheat in due season?* ([Luke
xii. 42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p3.2"></span>).  Now by a measure of wheat is expressed
a portion of the Word, lest, when anything is given to a narrow heart
beyond its capacity, it be spilt.  Hence Paul says, *I could* <span
id="page_71b">p. 71b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.xl-Page_71b"></span>*not
speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.  As it were to
babes in Christ, I have given you milk to drink, and not meat* ([1 Cor.
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#002)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p3.3"></span>).  Hence Moses, when he comes on from the
sanctuary of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p3.4"></span>God</span>, veils his shining face before
the people; because in truth He shews not to multitudes the secrets of
inmost brightness ([Exod. 34:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#033),
[35](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#035)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p3.5"></span>).  Hence it is enjoined on him by the
Divine voice that if any one should dig a cistern, and not cover it, and
an ox or ass should fall into it, he should pay the price ([Exod.
21:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#033),
[34](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#034)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p3.6"></span>), because when one who has arrived at the
deep streams of knowledge covers them not up before the brutish hearts
of his hearers, he is adjudged as liable to penalty, if through his
words a soul, whether clean or unclean, be caught on a stumbling-stone. 
Hence it is said to the blessed Job, *Who hath given understanding unto
the cock?* ([Job xxxviii. 36](../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#036)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p3.7"></span>).  For a holy preacher, crying aloud in
time of darkness, is as the cock crowing in the night, when he says, *It
is even now the hour for us to arise from sleep* ([Rom. xiii.
11](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#011)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p3.8"></span>).  And again, *Awake ye righteous, and
sin not* ([1 Cor. xv. 34](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#034)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.xl-p3.9"></span>).  But the cock is wont to utter loud
chants in the deeper hours of the night; but, when the time of morning
is already at hand, he frames small and slender tones; because, in fact,
he who preaches aright cries aloud plainly to hearts that are still in
the dark, and shews them nothing of hidden mysteries, that they may then
hear the more subtle teachings concerning heavenly things, when they
draw nigh to the light of truth.
