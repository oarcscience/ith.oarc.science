<span id="iii.v.i.xli-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xli-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xli-p2"></span>To Gennadius, Patrician and Exarch of
Africa.

<span id="iii.v.i.xli-p3"></span>Gregory to Gennadius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xli-p4"></span>That you have unceasingly the fear of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xli-p4.1"></span>God</span> before
your eyes, and pursue justice, the subdued necks of enemies testify;
but, that the grace of Christ may keep your Glory in the same
prosperity, restrain, as you have been wont, with speedy prohibition
whatever things you discover to be committed wrongfully, so that,
fortified with the arms of justice, you may overcome hostile attacks
with the power of faith, which is the top of all virtue.  Now
Marinianus, our brother and fellow-bishop of the city of Turris <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[1374](#fn_1373) has tearfully represented to us
that the poor of his city are being vexed everywhere, and afflicted by
expenses in the way of gifts or payments <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[1375](#fn_1374) ; and further that the
religious <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1376](#fn_1375) of his church
endure serious molestation from the men of Theodorus the *magister
militum*, and suffer bodily injuries; and that this thing is breaking
out to such a pitch that (shocking to say) they are thrust into prison,
and that he himself also is seriously hindered by the aforesaid glorious
person in causes pertaining to his Church.  How opposed such things are,
if indeed they are true, to the discipline of the republic you
yourselves know.  And, since it befits your Excellency to amend all
these things, greeting your Eminence I demand of you that you suffer
them to be done no more; but straightly order him to abstain from
harming the Church, and that none be aggrieved by burdens laid upon
them, or payments <span id="fr_1376"></span>[1377](#fn_1376) , beyond
what reason allows, and that, if there should be any suits, they be
determined not by the terror of power, but by order of law.  I pray you,
then, so correct all these things, the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xli-p8.1"></span>Lord</span> inspiring you, by the menace of
your injunction that the glorious Theodorus and his men may abstain from
such things, if not out of regard to rectitude, yet at any rate out of
fear inspired by your command; that so, to the advancement of your
credit and reward, justice with liberty may flourish in the parts
committed to your charge.
