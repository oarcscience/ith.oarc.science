<span id="iii.v.i.vi"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p1.1"></span>Epistle VI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p2"></span>*To Narses, Patrician* <span
id="fr_1304"></span>[1305](#fn_1304) .

<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p4"></span>Gregory to Narses, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p5"></span>In describing loftily the sweetness of
contemplation, you have renewed the groans of my fallen state, since I
hear what I have lost inwardly while mounting outwardly, though
undeserving, to the topmost height of rule.  Know then that I am
stricken with so great sorrow that I can scarcely speak; for the dark
shades of grief block up the eyes of my soul.  Whatever is beheld is
sad, whatever is thought delightful appears to my heart lamentable.  For
I reflect to what a dejected height of external advancement I have
mounted in falling from the lofty height of my rest.  And, being sent
for my faults into the exile of employment from the face of my <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.vi-p5.1"></span>Lord</span>, I say with the
prophet, in the words, as it were of destroyed Jerusalem, *He who should
comfort me hath departed far from me* ([Lam. i.
16](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#016)<span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p5.2"></span>).  But when, in seeking a similitude to
express my condition and title, you frame periods and declamations in
your letter, certainly, dearest brother, you call an ape a lion.  Herein
we see that you do as we often do, when we call mangy whelps pards or
tigers.  For I, my good man, have, as it were, lost my children, since
through earthly cares I have lost works of righteousness.  Therefore
*call me not Noemi, that is fair; but call me Mara, for I am full of
bitterness* ([Ruth i. 20](../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020)<span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p5.3"></span>).  But as to your saying that I ought not
to have written, “That you should plough with *bubali* <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1306](#fn_1305) in the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p6.3"></span>Lord’s</span> field,” seeing that when in
the sheet shewn to the blessed Peter both *bubali* and all wild beasts
were presented to view; thou knowest thyself that it is subjoined, *Slay
and eat* ([Acts x. 13](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#013)<span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p6.4"></span>).  Thou, then, who hadst not yet slain
these beasts, why didst thou already wish to eat them through
obedience?  Or knowest thou not that the beast about which thou wrotest
refused to be slain by the sword of thy mouth?  Thou must needs, then,
satisfy the hunger of thy desire with those whom thou hast been able to
prick and slay (*Lit.*, to slay through compunction) <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[1307](#fn_1306) .

<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p8"></span>Further, as to the case of our brethren,
I think that, if <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p8.1"></span>God</span> gives aid, it will be as thou
hast written.  It was not, however, by any means right for me to write
about it at present to our most serene lords, since at the very outset
one should not begin with complaints.  But I have written to my
well-beloved son, the deacon Honoratus <span
id="fr_1307"></span>[1308](#fn_1307) , that he should mention the matter
to them in a suitable manner at a seasonable time, and speedily inform
me of their reply.  I beg greetings to be given in my behalf to the lord
Alexander, the lord Theodorus <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1309](#fn_1308)
, my son Marinus, the lady Esicia, the lady Eudochia, and the lady
Dominica.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1304"></span>[76b:1305](2120308.htm#fr_1304) <span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p3"></span> There are other letters from Gregory to
this Narses, viz. iv. 32, vi. 14, and perhaps vii. 30.  He may have been
the same as the Narses who was a famous general of the Emperor Maurice,
and who was eventually burnt alive by Phocas.  (Theoph., Sim. V.)

<span id="fn_1305"></span>[76b:1306](2120308.htm#fr_1305) <span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p5.4"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p6"></span> The animal called <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.v.i.vi-p6.1"></span>βούβαλος</span> is
described by Pliny (l. 8, c. 15) as “animal ferum in Africa, vitulo ac
cervo simile.”  The reference in the text is to [Amos vi.
12](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012)<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p6.2"></span>,
where the Vulgate has, “Numquid currere queunt in petris equi, aut arari
potest in bubalis?”  The clause in the epistle, “ut in agro Dominico cum
bubalis arares,” appears to be a quotation from a previous letter of
Gregory’s, in which he may have announced his election to Narses.

<span id="fn_1306"></span>[76b:1307](2120308.htm#fr_1306) <span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p6.5"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p7"></span> The whole passage is rather obscure to
us, not having before us the letter from Narses, which is replied to, or
the previous ones from Gregory to which Narses had referred.  The drift
seems to be as follows.  Gregory, in his former letter, had compared his
being elected pope to a *bubalis* being set to plough in the Lord’s
field.  Narses had replied to the effect that even if he were a
*bubalus*, he was not therefore unfit, since *bubali*, with other wild
beasts, had been in St. Peter’s sheet, and pronounced clean.  To this
Gregory now rejoins, “Yes; but those beasts were to be slain before they
might be eaten; and so you must first slay me, *per compuctionem*—i.e.
by so pricking me with ‘the sword of your mouth’ as to induce me to
comply—before you may eat me *per obedientiam*—i.e. make use of me in
the way you wish through my obedience to your desire.  Not being thus so
far slain, I have a right to protest against being made pope against my
will.”

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[76b:1308](2120308.htm#fr_1307) <span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p8.2"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p9"></span> Honoratus was at this time Gregory’s
apocrisiarius at Constantinople.  We find several letters addressed to
him in this capacity, but none throwing light on the case here referred
to.

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[76b:1309](2120308.htm#fr_1308) <span
id="iii.v.i.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.vi-p10"></span> Theodorus was the court Physician at
Constantinople, to whom Epistles III. 66, IV. 31, VII. 28, are
addressed.
