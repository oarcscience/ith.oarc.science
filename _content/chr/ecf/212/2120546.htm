<p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p1.1"></A>Epistle XXV.</span></p>  
<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p2"></A>To Gregoria.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p3"></A>Gregory to Gregoria, Lady of the Bed-chamber (<i>cubiculari&aelig;</i>) to Augusta.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p4"></A>I have received the longed for letters of your Sweetness, in which you have been at pains all through to accuse yourself of a multitude of sins:&#160; but I know that you fervently love the Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p4.1"></A>Lord</span>, and I trust in His mercy that the sentence which was pronounced with regard to a certain holy woman proceeds from the mouth of the Truth with regard to you:&#160; <i>Her sins, which are many, are forgiven her, for she loved much</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#047">Luke vii. 47</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p4.2"></A>).&#160; And how they were forgiven is shewn also by what follows afterwards; that she sat at the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p4.3"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> feet, and heard the word from His mouth (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039">Luke x. 39</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p4.4"></A>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1702"></A><A HREF="#fn_1702"><FONT SIZE="1">1703</FONT></A>
.&#160; For, being rapt in the contemplative, she had transcended the active life, which Martha her sister still pursued (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#040">Luke 10.40</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p5.1"></A>).&#160; She also sought earnestly her buried <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p5.2"></A>Lord</span>, and, stooping over the sepulchre, found not His body.&#160; But, even when the disciples went away, she remained standing before the door of the sepulchre, and whom she sought as dead, Him she was counted worthy to see alive, and announced to the disciples that He had risen again.&#160; And this was by the wonderful dispensation of the loving-kindness of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p5.3"></A>God</span>, that life should be announced by a woman&#146;s mouth, because by a woman&#146;s mouth had been the first taste of death in Paradise.&#160; And at another time also, with another Mary, she saw the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p5.4"></A>Lord</span> after His resurrection, and held His feet.&#160; Bring before your eyes, I pray you, what hands held whose feet.&#160; That woman who had been a sinner in the city, those hands which had been polluted with iniquity, touched the feet of Him who sits at the right hand of the Father above all the angels.&#160; Let us estimate, if we can, what those bowels of heavenly loving-kindness are, that a woman who had been plunged through sin into the whirlpool&#146;s depth should be thus lifted high on the wing of love through grace.&#160; It is fulfilled, sweet daughter, it is fulfilled, what was promised to us by the prophetic voice concerning this time of the holy Church:&#160; <i>And in that day the house of David shall be an open fountain for ablution of the sinner and of her that is unclean</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001">Zech. 13:1</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p5.5"></A>).&#160; For the house of David is an open fountain for ablution to us sinners, because we are washed from the filth of our iniquities by mercy now disclosed through the son of David our Saviour.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p6"></A>But as to what thy Sweetness has added in thy letters, namely that thou wilt continue to be urgent with me till I write that it has been revealed to me that thy sins are forgiven, thou hast demanded a difficult, nay even an unprofitable thing; difficult indeed, because I am unworthy of having a revelation made to me; but unprofitable, because thou oughtest not to become secure about thy sins, except when in the last day of thy life thou shalt be able no longer to bewail them.&#160; But, until that day comes, thou oughtest, ever suspicious and ever fearful, to be afraid of faults, and wash them with daily tears.&#160; Assuredly the apostle Paul had already ascended into the third heaven, had also been caught up into Paradise, and heard secret words which it was not lawful for a man to speak (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#002">2 Cor. xii. 2</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p6.1"></A>, &amp;c.), and yet, still fearful, he said, <i>I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means, while preaching to others, I myself should become a castaway</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#027">1 Cor. ix. 27</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p6.2"></A>).&#160; One who is caught up into heaven still fears; and shall one whose conversation is still on earth desire already not to fear?&#160; Consider, most sweet daughter, that security is wont to be the mother of carelessness.&#160; Thou oughtest not, then, in this life to have security, whereby thou mayest be rendered careless.&#160; For it is written, <i>Happy is the man that is always afraid</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#014">Prov. xxviii. 14</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p6.3"></A>).&#160; And again it is written, <i>Serve the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p6.4"></A>Lord</span> in fear, and rejoice unto him with trembling</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#011">Ps. ii. 11</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p6.5"></A>).&#160; In short, then, it must needs be that in the time of this life trembling possess your soul, to the end that it may hereafter rejoice without end through the joy of security.&#160; May Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p6.6"></A>God</span> fill your soul with the grace of His Holy Spirit, and, after the tears which you daily shed in prayer, bring you to eternal joys.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.vii.xiv-p5"></A> It will be observed that Gregory identifies the woman who had been a sinner in the city with the sister of Martha, and also with the Magdalene.</p>
