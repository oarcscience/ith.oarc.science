<span id="iii.v.iv.xxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLVII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxxii-p2"></span>*To Sabinianus, Deacon* <span
id="fr_1569"></span>[1570](#fn_1569) .

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxxii-p4"></span>Gregory to Sabinianus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxxii-p5"></span>Thou knowest what has been done in
the case of the prevaricator Maximus <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[1571](#fn_1570) .  For after the most serene <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iv.xxxii-p6.1"></span>Lord</span> the Emperor
had sent orders that he should not be ordained <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[1572](#fn_1571) , then he broke out into a higher
pitch of pride.  For the men of the glorious patrician Romanus <span
id="fr_1572"></span>[1573](#fn_1572) received bribes from him, and
caused him to be ordained in such a manner that they would have killed
Antoninus, the sub-deacon and rector of the patrimony, if he had not
fled.  But I despatched letters to him, after I had learnt that he had
been ordained against reason and custom, telling him not to presume to
celebrate the solemnities of mass unless I should first ascertain from
our most serene lords what they had ordered with regard to him.  And
these my letters, having been publicly promulged or posted in the city,
he caused to be publicly torn, and thus bounced forth more openly into
contempt of the Apostolic See.  How I was likely to endure this thou
knowest, seeing that I was before prepared rather to die than that the
Church of the blessed apostle Peter should degenerate in my days. 
Moreover thou art well acquainted with my ways, that I bear long; but if
once I have determined not to bear, I go gladly in the face of all
dangers.  Whence it is necessary with the help of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxxii-p8.1"></span>God</span> to meet danger, lest he be
driven to sin to excess.  Look to what I say, and consider what great
grief inspires it.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxxii-p9"></span>But it has come to my ears that he
has sent \[to Constantinople\] a cleric, I know not whom, to say that
the bishop Malchus <span id="fr_1573"></span>[1574](#fn_1573) was put to
death in prison for money.  Now as to this there is one thing that thou
mayest shortly suggest to our most serene lords;—that, if I their
servant had been willing to have anything to do with the death of
Lombards, the nation of the Lombards at this day would have had neither
king nor dukes nor counts, and would have been divided in the utmost
confusion.  But, since I fear <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxxii-p10.1"></span>God</span>, I shrink from having
anything to do with the death of any one.  Now the bishop Malchus was
neither in prison nor in any distress; but on the day when he pleaded
his cause and was sentenced he was taken without my knowledge by
Boniface the notary to his house, where a dinner was prepared for him,
and there he dined, and was treated with honour by the said Boniface,
and in the night suddenly died, as I think you have already been
informed.  Moreover I had intended to send our Exhilaratus to you in
connection with that business; but, as I considered that the case was
now done with, I consequently abstained from doing so.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxxii-p7"></span> In his letter to Maximus (IV. 20),
Gregory had only expressed a suspicion that the alleged order of the
Emperor for his consecration had been fictitious.  He now seems to have
satisfied himself that it was so.  For a review of the whole case, see
III. 47, note 2.
