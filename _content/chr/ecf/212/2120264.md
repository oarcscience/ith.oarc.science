<span id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>How servants and masters are to be
admonished.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p3"></span>(*Admonition* 6).  Differently to be
admonished are servants and masters.  Servants, <span id="page_28b">p.
28b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.vi-Page_28b"></span>to wit, that they
ever keep in view the humility of their condition; but masters, that
they lose not recollection of their nature, in which they are
constituted on an equality with servants.  Servants are to be admonished
that they despise not their masters, lest they offend <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p3.1"></span>God</span>, if by
behaving themselves proudly they gainsay His ordinance:  masters, too,
are to be admonished, that they are proud against <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p3.2"></span>God</span> with respect to His gift, if
they acknowledge not those whom they hold in subjection by reason of
their condition to be their equals by reason of their community of
nature.  The former are to be admonished to know themselves to be
servants of masters; the latter are to be admonished to acknowledge
themselves to be fellow-servants of servants.  For to those it is said,
*Servants, obey your masters according to the flesh* ([Coloss. iii.
22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p3.3"></span>); and again, *Let as many servants as are
under the yoke count their masters worthy of all honour* ([1 Tim. vi.
1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#001)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p3.4"></span>); but to these it is said, *And ye,
masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening, knowing
that both their and your Master is in heaven* ([Ephes. vi.
9](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#009)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p3.5"></span>).
