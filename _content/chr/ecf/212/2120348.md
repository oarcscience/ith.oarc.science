<span id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXXII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p2"></span>To Peter, Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p3"></span>Gregory to Peter, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p4"></span>Thou hast learnt from a former
letter <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380) that we have desired
our brethren and fellow-bishops dwelling in the island of Sicily to
assemble here for the anniversary of the blessed Peter the apostle. 
But, seeing that their suit with the magnificent Justin the
ex-prætor <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381) has meanwhile
hindered them, and that there is not now sufficient time for coming and
returning, we do not wish them to be troubled before winter.  But
Gregory of Agrigentum, Leo of Catana, and Victor of Panormus, we by all
means desire to come to us before winter <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382) .  Further, get together from
strangers <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383) corn of this year’s
growth to the value of fifty pounds of gold, and lay it up in Sicily in
places where it will not rot, that we may send thither in the month of
February as many ships as we can to convey this corn to us.  But, in
case of our delaying to send ships, do thou thyself provide some, and,
with the help of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p8.1"></span>Lord</span>, transmit this same corn to us
in February, with the exception, however, of the <span id="page_98b">p.
98b</span> <span id="iii.v.i.xlvi-Page_98b"></span>corn which we expect
to have sent to us now, according to custom, in the months of September
or October.  Let thy Experience, then, so proceed that, without
annoyance to any husbandman (*colonus*) of the Church <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384) , the corn may be collected, since
there has been here such a scanty crop that, unless by <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p9.1"></span>God’s</span> help corn be
collected from Sicily, there is a serious prospect of famine.  But keep
guard in all ways over the ships that have always been assigned to the
use of Holy Church, as the letters also addressed to thee by the
glorious ex-consul Leo concur in directing thee to do.  Moreover, many
come hither desiring sundry lands or islands belonging to our Church to
be leased to them; and some, indeed, we refuse, but to others we have
already granted their request.  But let thy Experience see to the
advantage of Holy Church, remembering that thou hast before the most
sacred body of the blessed apostle Peter received power over his
patrimony.  And, though letters should reach you from hence, allow
nothing to be done in any way to the disadvantage of the patrimony,
since we neither remember to have given, nor are disposed to give away,
any thing without good reason.

id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p5"></span> See Ep. XXXVI.

<span id="fn_1381"></span>[97b:1382](2120348.htm#fr_1381) <span
id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p6"></span> See Ep. II.  If this Epistle is
rightly assigned to the ninth Indiction, the title *ex-prætor* may
possibly be an error in the text since Justin is still addressed as
*prætor* in the following Indiction (II. 33).  Libertinus appears to
have succeeded him as Prætor of Sicily in the eleventh Indiction.  See
III. 38.

<span id="fn_1382"></span>[97b:1383](2120348.htm#fr_1382) <span
id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xlvi-p7"></span> Two of these bishops, Gregory and
Leo, are referred to afterwards as having been at Rome to answer to
certain charges.  See II. 33, and III. 12.

of corn outside the patrimony of the Church.
