<span id="iii.v.iv.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxv-p2"></span>To Anthemius, Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxv-p3"></span>Gregory to Anthemius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iv.xxv-p4"></span>Those whom our Redeemer vouchsafes to
convert to himself from Judaical perdition we ought, with reasonable
moderation, to assist; lest (as <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iv.xxv-p4.1"></span>God</span> forbid should be the case) they
should suffer from lack of food.  Accordingly we charge thee, under the
authority of this order, not to neglect to give money every year to the
children of Justa, who is of the Hebrews; that is to Julianus,
Redemptus, and Fortuna, beginning from the coming thirteenth Indiction;
and know that the payment is by all means to be charged in thy accounts.
