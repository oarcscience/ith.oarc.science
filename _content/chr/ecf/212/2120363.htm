<p class="c40"><a name="iii.v.ii.viii-p4"></A>Gregory to Natalis, &amp;c.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.ii.viii-p5"></A>I have learnt, dearest brother, from many who have come from thy city that, neglecting thy pastoral charge, thou occupiest thyself wholly in feastings:&#160; which report I should not have believed had not my own experience of thy conduct confirmed it.&#160; For that thou in no wise art intent on reading, in no wise givest attention to exhortation, but art even ignorant of the very use and purpose of ecclesiastical order, there is this in evidence, that thou knowest not how to observe reverence to those who are put over thee.&#160; For, when thou hadst been forbidden in writing by our predecessor of holy memory to retain in thy heart the soreness of thy long displeasure against Honoratus thy archdeacon, and when this had been positively interdicted thee by myself also, thou, disregarding the commands of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.viii-p5.1"></A>God</span>, and setting at naught our letters, didst attempt by a cunning device to degrade the aforesaid Honoratus thy archdeacon under colour of promoting him to a higher dignity.&#160; Thus it was contrived that, he being removed from the post of archdeacon, thou mightest call in another who would have fallen in with thy manner of life, the aforesaid man having, as I think, displeased thee for no other cause but that he prevented thee from giving sacred vessels and vestments to thy relations.&#160; Which case both I now, and my predecessor of holy memory formerly, have wished to subject to an accurate investigation; but thou, being conscious of what thou hadst done,  <A NAME="page_104b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.ii.viii-Page_104b"></A>hast put off sending hither a representative instructed for trial of the case.&#160; Wherefore let thy Fraternity, even after admonition so often repeated, repent of the error of thy wrongdoing, and restore the aforesaid Honoratus to his post immediately on the receipt of my letter.&#160; Which if thou shouldest defer doing, know that the use of the pallium, granted thee by this See, is taken from thee.&#160; But if, even when thou hast lost the pallium, thou still persistest in thy contumacy, know that thou art deprived of participation of the body and blood of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.viii-p5.2"></A>Lord</span>.&#160; And after this it will be needful for us to enquire more fully into the charges against thee, and to consider with the utmost care and investigation whether thou shouldest retain even thy episcopate.&#160; Him also who, against the rule of justice, has consented to be promoted to the place of another we depose from the dignity of the said archdeaconry.&#160; And, should he presume any longer to minister in this same office, let him know that he is deprived of participation in holy communion.&#160; Do thou, therefore, dearest brother, in no wise provoke us further, lest, having set us at naught when in an attitude of charity towards thee, thou shouldest find us very hard in our severity.&#160; Having, therefore, restored the archdeacon Honoratus to his place, send to us with speed a person instructed in the case, who may be able to shew to me by his allegations how the matter should be equitably proceeded with.&#160; For we have commanded the said archdeacon to come to us, that, having heard the assertions of the parties, we may come to whatever decision may be just and well-pleasing to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.viii-p5.3"></A>God</span>.&#160; For we defend no one on the ground of personal love, but, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.viii-p5.4"></A>God</span> helping us, keep the rule of justice, putting aside respect to any man&#146;s person.</p>
