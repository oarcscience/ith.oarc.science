<span id="iii.v.ii.xviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.xviii-p2"></span>*To Justinus, Prætor* <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[1438](#fn_1437) .

<span id="iii.v.ii.xviii-p4"></span>Gregory to Justinus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xviii-p5"></span>The spite of the ancient foe has
this way of its own, that in the case of those whom, through <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.xviii-p5.1"></span>God</span> resisting
him, he cannot delude into the perpetration of evil deeds, he maims
their reputation for a time by false reports.  Seeing, then, that a
sinister rumour about our brother and fellow-bishop Leo <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[1439](#fn_1438) had disseminated certain things
inconsistent with his priestly profession, we caused strict and
lengthened enquiry to be made as to whether they were true, and we have
found no fault in him touching the things that had been said.  But, that
nothing might seem to be omitted, and that no possible doubt might
remain in our heart, we caused him over and above to take a strict oath
before the most sacred body of the blessed Peter.  And, when he had done
this, we rejoiced with great exultation that from a proof of this kind
his innocence evidently shone forth.  Wherefore let your Glory receive
the aforesaid man with all charity, and shew him reverence such as is
becoming towards a priest; nor let any doubtfulness remain in your heart
touching the charges from which he has now been purged.  But it lies
upon you so to cleave in all respects to the above-named bishop, that
you may be seen fittingly and becomingly in his person to honour <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.xviii-p6.1"></span>God</span>, whose
minister he is.
