<span id="iii.v.vi.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xvi-p2"></span>To Marinianus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xvi-p3"></span>Gregory to Marinianus, Bishop of
Ravenna.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xvi-p4"></span>We have received by the deacon
Virgilius <span id="page_195b">p. 195b</span> <span
id="iii.v.vi.xvi-Page_195b"></span>the letter of your Fraternity, in
which you inform us that certain of the clergy and people have cried out
that it is contrary to the laws and canons that the cause between your
Church and the abbot Claudius should be examined and decided here.  But,
had they paid attention to ecclesiastical order and to the persons
between whom the case is pending, they would by all means have abstained
from needless complaint; especially as the cause could not be pleaded
there, where the aforesaid abbot has complained of having endured
injustice from your predecessor and of still suffering from it.  For the
objection might perhaps have been made if he had not appealed to a
superior authority, and sought to have the rights of his case determined
before it.  Nay, but dost thou not thyself know that the case which
arose on the part of the presbyter John against John of Constantinople,
our brother and fellow-bishop, came before the Apostolic See, and was
decided by our sentence? <span id="fr_1645"></span>[1646](#fn_1645)  
If, then, a cause was brought under our cognizance from that city where
the prince is, how much more should an affair between you have the truth
about it ascertained and be terminated here?  But as for you, let not
the words of foolish men there move you, and believe not that through us
any detriment to your Church is caused.  For, if you will enquire of the
servant of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xvi-p5.1"></span>God</span> Secundinus your deacon and of
Castorius our notary, you will learn from them how your predecessor had
already desired to arrange this case.  But your Fraternity has done
wisely in sending persons hither for this business, and in not listening
to vain words.  Now we trust in Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xvi-p5.2"></span>God</span> that this cause may be
terminated in a way well-pleasing to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xvi-p5.3"></span>God</span>, so that no room may be left
for renewed complaint and that neither party may be aggrieved unjustly. 
The sword <span id="fr_1646"></span>[1647](#fn_1646) which our most
beloved son Peter, then deacon and guardian (*defensor*) in your parts,
had left for us with your predecessor, please to send to us by the
servant of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xvi-p6.1"></span>God</span> Secundinus, and Castorius the
notary, the bearers of these presents.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xvi-p5"></span> See III. 53, note 9, and *reff*
there.  It seems from what Gregory here says, that it was not in the
East only, but also in Italy, at Ravenna, that the authority of the
Roman See met with opposition, perhaps mainly on the ground of Ravenna
having been an Imperial city, and being still the seat of the Exarch of
Italy.  Cf. III. 57, note 4.
