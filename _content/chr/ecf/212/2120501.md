Corsica.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xv-p4"></span>Inasmuch as in the isle of Corsica, at
the place Nigeunum, in the possession which is called Cellas Cupias
belonging to the holy Roman Church, which by the providence of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vi.xv-p4.1"></span>God</span> we serve, we
have ordered to be founded a basilica, with a baptistery <span
id="fr_1644"></span>[1645](#fn_1644) , to the honour of the blessed
Peter, Prince of the apostles, and of Laurentius the martyr, we
therefore hereby exhort thy Fraternity to proceed at once to the
aforesaid place, and with observance of the venerable solemnities of
dedication to consecrate solemnly the aforesaid church and baptistery. 
Deposit also reverently the holy relics (*sanctuaria*) which you have
received.
