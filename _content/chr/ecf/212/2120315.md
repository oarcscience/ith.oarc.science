id="iii.v.i.xiii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XVII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xiii-p2"></span>To all the Bishops of Italy.

<span id="iii.v.i.xiii-p3"></span>Gregory to all, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xiii-p4"></span>Inasmuch as the abominable
Autharit <span id="fr_1317"></span>[1318](#fn_1317) during this Easter
solemnity which has been lately completed, forbade children of Lombards
being baptized in the catholic faith, for which sin the Divine Majesty
cut him off, so that he should not see the solemnity of another Easter,
it becomes your Fraternity to warn all the Lombards in your districts,
seeing that grievous mortality is everywhere <span id="page_79b">p.
79b</span> <span id="iii.v.i.xiii-Page_79b"></span>imminent, that they
should reconcile these their children who have been baptized in Arian
heresy to the catholic faith, and so appease the wrath of the Almighty
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xiii-p5.2"></span>Lord</span> which
hangs over them.  Warn, then, those whom you can; with all the power of
persuasion you possess seize on them, and bring them to a right faith;
preach to them eternal life without end; that, when you shall come into
the sight of the strict judge, you may be able, in consequence of your
solicitude, to shew in your own persons a shepherd’s gains.

<span id="iii.v.i.xiii-p5"></span> Autharit (*al*. Autharith, called by
Paul. Diac. *Authari*), who died at Pavia in this year (<span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xiii-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span> 591) had been
king of the Lombards for six years, having effected extensive conquests
in Italy.  “Rex Authari apud Ticinum Nonas Septembris veneno, ut
tradunt, accepto moritur, postquam sex regnaverat annos.”  (*Paul. Diac.
de gestis Longob.* iii. 36).  It is he who is said to have advanced to
Rhegium at the toe of Italy. and there, riding up to a pillar in the
sea, to have touched it with the point of his spear, and said, “As far
as this shall the boundaries of the Lombards extend.”  (*Paul. Diac*.
iii. 33.)  He had been a determined Arian.  He was succeeded by
Agilulph, whom his widow Theodelinda, a Catholic Bavarian princess,
selected as her consort.  With her Gregory carried on a very friendly
correspondence and probably through her influence, Agilulph himself,
originally an Arian, is said to have been converted to Catholicity. 
Gregory’s letters to Theodelinda are IV. 4, 38; IX. 43; XIV. 12.
