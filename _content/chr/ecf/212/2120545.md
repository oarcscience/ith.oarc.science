<span id="iii.v.vii.xiii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xiii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.xiii-p2"></span>*To Fortunatus and Anthemius* <span
id="fr_1700"></span>[1701](#fn_1700) .

<span id="iii.v.vii.xiii-p4"></span>Gregory to Fortunatus, bishop, and
Anthemius, guardian (*defensori*).

<span id="iii.v.vii.xiii-p5"></span>Catellus, the bearer of these
presents, has informed us that his sister, who had been betrothed to one
Stephen, has, through divine mercy moving her, been converted <span
id="fr_1701"></span>[1702](#fn_1701) in a monastery at Naples, and that
the same Stephen improperly detains a house and some other things
belonging to her.  And, inasmuch as legal decrees (*Caus.* 17, q. 2, c.
28) have appointed that a betrothed woman, should she wish to be
converted, shall suffer no loss whatever, let thy Fraternity, together
with Anthemius the subdeacon, endeavour by diligent enquiry to
investigate the truth.  And if, as we have been informed, you find that
the Stephen above-named is keeping a house or anything else unjustly,
let him be urgently warned by your exhortation to restore without any
delay or altercation what he unduly detains, and not to defer under any
kind of excuse the restitution of what is not his own.  And if perchance
you find him neglect your exhortation, notify this to us, giving also an
accurate account of the <span id="page_219b">p. 219b</span> <span
id="iii.v.vii.xiii-Page_219b"></span>facts of the case, to the end that,
when the merits of the case are known, he may be forced by other means,
in accordance with equity, to make the restitution which he scorns to
make of his own accord out of regard to honesty.  Commending the bearer
of these presents to thy Fraternity, we exhort thee to allow him no
longer to suffer from delay on this account.
