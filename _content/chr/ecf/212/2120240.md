<span id="iii.iv.ii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vii-p2"></span>That those who fly from the burden of
rule through humility are then truly humble when they resist not the
divine decrees.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.vii-p3"></span>There are some also who fly by reason
only of their humility, lest they should be preferred to others to whom
they esteem themselves unequal.  And theirs, indeed, if it be surrounded
by other virtues, is then true humility before the eyes of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.ii.vii-p3.1"></span>God</span>, when it is
not pertinacious in rejecting what it is enjoined to undertake with
profit.  For neither is he truly humble, who understands how the good
pleasure of the Supernal Will ought to bear sway, and yet contemns its
sway.  But, submitting himself to the divine disposals, and averse from
the vice of obstinacy, if he be already prevented with gifts whereby he
may profit others also, he ought, when enjoined to undertake supreme
rule, in his heart to flee from it, but against his will to obey.
