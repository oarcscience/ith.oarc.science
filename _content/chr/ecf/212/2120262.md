<span id="iii.iv.iv.iv-p2"></span>How the joyful and the sad are to be
admonished.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.iv-p3"></span>*Admonition*4.  Differently to be
admonished are the joyful and the sad.  That is, before the joyful are
to be set the sad things that follow upon punishment; but before the sad
the promised glad things of the kingdom.  Let the joyful learn by the
asperity of threatenings what to be afraid of:  let the sad bear what
joys of reward they may look forward to.  For to the former it is said,
*Woe unto you that laugh now!  For ye shall weep* ([Luke vi.
25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.iv-p3.1"></span>); but the latter hear from the teaching
of the same Master, *I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice,
and your joy no man shall take from you* ([Joh. xvi.
22](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#022)<span
id="iii.iv.iv.iv-p3.2"></span>).  But some are not made joyful or sad by
circumstances, but are so by temperament.  And to such it should be
intimated that certain defects are connected with certain temperaments;
that the joyful have lechery close at hand, and the sad wrath.  Hence it
is necessary for every one to consider not only what he suffers from his
peculiar temperament, but also what worse thing presses on him in
connection with it; lest, while he fights not at all against that which
he has, he succumb also to that from which he supposes himself free.
