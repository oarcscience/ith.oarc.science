<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.i.xiii-p5"></A> Autharit (<i>al</i>. Autharith, called by Paul. Diac. <i>Authari</i>), who died at Pavia in this year (<span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xiii-p5.1"></A>a.d.</span> 591) had been king of the Lombards for six years, having effected extensive conquests in Italy.&#160; &#8220;Rex Authari apud Ticinum Nonas Septembris veneno, ut tradunt, accepto moritur, postquam sex regnaverat annos.&#8221;&#160; (<i>Paul. Diac. de gestis Longob.</i> iii. 36).&#160; It is he who is said to have advanced to Rhegium at the toe of Italy. and there, riding up to a pillar in the sea, to have touched it with the point of his spear, and said, &#8220;As far as this shall the boundaries of the Lombards extend.&#8221;&#160; (<i>Paul. Diac</i>. iii. 33.)&#160; He had been a determined Arian.&#160; He was succeeded by Agilulph, whom his widow Theodelinda, a Catholic Bavarian princess, selected as her consort.&#160; With her Gregory carried on a very friendly correspondence and probably through her influence, Agilulph himself, originally an Arian, is said to have been converted to Catholicity.&#160; Gregory&#146;s letters to Theodelinda are IV. 4, 38; IX. 43; XIV. 12.</p>
