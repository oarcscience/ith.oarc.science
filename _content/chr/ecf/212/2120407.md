<span id="iii.v.iii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxi-p2"></span>To Andrew, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxi-p3"></span>Gregory to Andrew, Bishop of Tarentum
\[*Taranto, in Calabria*\].

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxi-p4"></span>A man may look without alarm to the
tribunal of the eternal Judge, if only, conscious of his own guilt, he
strives to pacify Him by befitting penitence.  Now that thou hadst a
concubine we find to be manifestly true, with regard to whom also an
adverse suspicion has arisen in the minds of some.  But, since in
doubtful cases judgment ought not to be absolute, we have chosen to
leave the matter to thine own conscience.  If, then, after being
constituted in sacred orders thou rememberest having been defiled by
carnal intercourse, thou must resign the dignity of priesthood, nor
presume by any means to approach its ministration, knowing that thou
wilt administer it to the peril of thy soul, and without doubt have to
render an account to our <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xxi-p4.1"></span>God</span>, if, being conscious of this
crime, thou shouldest desire to continue in the order wherein thou art,
concealing the truth.  Wherefore we again exhort thee that, if thou
knowest thyself to have been deceived by the craft of the ancient foe,
thou hasten to overcome him, while thou mayest, by adequate penitence,
lest, as we hope may not be, thou be reckoned as partner with him in the
day of judgment.  If, however, thou art not conscious of this guilt,
thou must needs continue in the order wherein thou art.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xxi-p5"></span>Furthermore, since, against due
order, thou didst doom a woman on the Church-roll <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1494](#fn_1493) to be cruelly beaten with cudgels,
although we do not think that she died eight months afterwards, yet,
because thou hast had no regard to thy order, we therefore sentence thee
to abstain for two months from the administration of mass.  Meanwhile,
being suspended from thy office, it will become thee to weep for what
thou hast done.  For it is very right that, now that the examples of
praiseworthy priests do not provoke thee to the tranquil rectitude
befitting thy position, at any rate the medicine of correction should
compel thee.

*Matricula* was probably a list or roll of names of widows and other who
were supported by the Church.
