<p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p1"></A> <span class="c16"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p1.1"></A>Sermon XLIX.</span></p>  
<p class="c26"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p2"></A><span class="c4"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p2.1"></A>On Lent, XI.</span></p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p3"></A>I.&#160; <i>The Lenten fast is incumbent on all alike.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p4"></A>On all days and seasons, indeed, dearly-beloved, some marks of the Divine goodness are set, and no part of the year is destitute of sacred mysteries, in order that, so long as proofs of our salvation meet us on all sides, we may the more eagerly accept the never-ceasing calls of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p4.1"></A>God&#146;s</span> mercy.&#160; But all that is bestowed on the restoration of human souls in the divers works and gifts of grace is put before us more clearly and abundantly now, when no isolated portions of the Faith are to be celebrated, but the whole together.&#160; For as the Easter festival approaches, the greatest and most binding of fasts is kept, and its observance is imposed on all the faithful without exception; because no one is so holy that he ought not to be holier, nor so devout that he might not be devouter.&#160; For who, that is set in the uncertainty of this life, can be found either exempt from temptation, or free from fault?&#160; Who is there who would not wish for additions to his virtue, or removal of his vice? seeing that adversity does us harm, and prosperity spoils us, and it is equally dangerous not to have what we want at all, and to have it in the fullest measure.&#160; There is a trap in the fulness of riches, a trap in the straits of poverty.&#160; The one lifts us up in pride, the other incites us to complaint.&#160; Health tries us, sickness tries us, so long as the one fosters carelessness and the other sadness.&#160; There is a snare in security, a snare in fear; and it matters not whether the mind which is given over to earthly thoughts, is taken up with pleasures or with cares; for it is equally unhealthy to languish under empty delights, or to labour under racking anxiety.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p5"></A>II.&#160; <i>The broad road is crowded, the narrow way of salvation nearly empty.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p6"></A>And thus is perfectly fulfilled that assurance of the Truth, by which we learn that &#8220;narrow and steep is the way that leads to life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_940"></A><A HREF="#fn_940"><FONT SIZE="1">941</FONT></A>
;&#8221; and whilst the breadth of the way that leads to death is crowded with a large company, the steps are few of those that tread the path of safety.&#160; And wherefore is the left road more thronged than the right, save that the multitude is prone to worldly joys and carnal goods?&#160; And although that which it desires is short-lived and uncertain, yet men endure toil more willingly for the lust of pleasure than for love of virtue.&#160; Thus while those who crave things visible are unnumbered, those who prefer the eternal to the temporal are hardly to be found.&#160; And, therefore, seeing that the blessed Apostle Paul says, &#8220;the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_941"></A><A HREF="#fn_941"><FONT SIZE="1">942</FONT></A>
,&#8221; the path of virtue lies hid and in concealment, to a certain extent, since &#8220;by hope we were saved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_942"></A><A HREF="#fn_942"><FONT SIZE="1">943</FONT></A>
,&#8221; and true faith loves that above all things, which it attains to without any intervention of the flesh.&#160; A great work and toil it is then to keep our wayward heart from all sin, and, with the numberless allurements of pleasure to ensnare it on all sides, not to let the vigour of the mind give way to any attack.&#160; Who &#8220;toucheth pitch, and is not defiled thereby&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_943"></A><A HREF="#fn_943"><FONT SIZE="1">944</FONT></A>
?&#8221; who is not weakened by the flesh? who is not begrimed by the dust? who, lastly, is of such purity as not to be polluted by those things without which one cannot live?&#160; For the Divine teaching commands by the Apostle&#146;s mouth that &#8220;they who have wives&#8221; should &#8220;be as though they had none:&#160; and those that weep as though they wept not; and those that rejoice as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy as though they possessed not; and those that use this world as though they used it not; for the fashion of this world passeth away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_944"></A><A HREF="#fn_944"><FONT SIZE="1">945</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; Blessed, therefore, is the mind that passes the time of its pilgrimage in chaste sobriety, and loiters not  <A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A> <a name="ii.v.xxv-Page_161"></A>in the things through which it has to walk, so that, as a stranger rather than the possessor of its earthly abode, it may not be wanting in human affections, and yet rest on the Divine promises.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p12"></A>III.&#160; <i>Satan is incited to fresh efforts at this season of the year.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p13"></A>And, dearly-beloved, no season requires and bestows this fortitude more than the present, when by the observance of a special strictness a habit is acquired which must be persevered in.&#160; For it is well known to you that this is the time when throughout the world the devil waxes furious, and the Christian army has to combat him, and any that have grown lukewarm and slothful, or that are absorbed in worldly cares, must now be furnished with spiritual armour and their ardour kindled for the fray by the heavenly trumpet, inasmuch as he, through whose envy death came into the world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_945"></A><A HREF="#fn_945"><FONT SIZE="1">946</FONT></A>
, is now consumed with the strongest jealousy and now tortured with the greatest vexation.&#160; For he sees&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_946"></A><A HREF="#fn_946"><FONT SIZE="1">947</FONT></A>
 whole tribes of the human race brought in afresh to the adoption of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p15.1"></A>God&#146;s</span> sons and the offspring of the New Birth multiplied through the virgin fertility of the Church.&#160; He sees himself robbed of all his tyrannic power, and driven from the hearts of those he once possessed, while from either sex thousands of the old, the young, the middle-aged are snatched away from him, and no one is debarred by sin either of his own or original, where justification is not paid for deserts, but simply given as a free gift.&#160; He sees, too, those that have lapsed, and have been deceived by his treacherous snares, washed in the tears of penitence and, by the Apostle&#146;s key unlocking the gates of mercy, admitted to the benefit of reconciliation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_947"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">948</FONT></A>
.&#160; He feels, moreover, that the day of the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p16.2"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> Passion is at hand, and that he is crushed by the power of that cross which in Christ, Who was free from all debt of sin, was the world&#146;s ransom and not the penalty of sin.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p17"></A>IV.&#160; <i>Self-examination by the standard of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p17.1"></A>God&#146;s</span> commands the right occupation in Lent.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p18"></A>And so, that the malice of the fretting foe may effect nothing by its rage, a keener devotion must be awaked to the performance of the Divine commands, in order that we may enter on the season, when all the mysteries of the Divine mercy meet together, with preparedness both of mind and body, invoking the guidance and help of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p18.1"></A>God</span>, that we may be strong to fulfil all things through Him, without Whom we can do nothing.&#160; For the injunction is laid on us, in order that we may seek the aid of Him Who lays it.&#160; Nor must any one excuse himself by reason of his weakness, since He Who has granted the will, also gives the power, as the blessed Apostle James says, &#8220;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p18.2"></A>God</span>, Who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_948"></A><A HREF="#fn_948"><FONT SIZE="1">949</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; Which of the faithful does not know what virtues he ought to cultivate, and what vices to fight against?&#160; Who is so partial or so unskilled a judge of his own conscience as not to know what ought to be removed, and what ought to be developed?&#160; Surely no one is so devoid of reason as not to understand the character of his mode of life, or not to know the secrets of his heart.&#160; Let him not then please himself in everything, nor judge himself according to the delights of the flesh, but place his every habit in the scale of the Divine commands, where, some things being ordered to be done and others forbidden, he can examine himself in a true balance by weighing the actions of his life according to this standard.&#160; For the designing mercy of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p19.2"></A>God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_949"></A><A HREF="#fn_949"><FONT SIZE="1">950</FONT></A>
</span> has set up the brightest mirror in His commandments, wherein a man may see his mind&#146;s face and realize its conformity or dissimilarity to <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p20.1"></A>God&#146;s</span> image:&#160; with the specific purpose that, at least, during the days of our Redemption and Restoration, we may throw off awhile our carnal cares and restless occupations, and betake ourselves from earthly matters to heavenly.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p21"></A>V.&#160; <i>Forgiveness of our own sins requires that we should forgive others.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p22"></A>But because, as it is written, &#8220;in many things we all stumble&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_950"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">951</FONT></A>
,&#8221; let the feeling of mercy be first aroused and the faults of others against us be forgotten; that we may not violate by any love of revenge that most holy compact, to which we bind ourselves in the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p23.2"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> prayer, and when we say &#8220;forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors,&#8221; let us not be hard in forgiving, because we must be possessed either with the desire for revenge, or with the leniency of gentleness, and for man, who is ever exposed to the dangers of temptations, it is more to be desired that his own faults should not need punishment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_951"></A><A HREF="#fn_951"><FONT SIZE="1">952</FONT></A>
 than that he should get the faults of others punished.&#160; And   <A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A> <a name="ii.v.xxv-Page_162"></A>what is more suitable to the Christian faith than that not only in the Church, but also in all men&#146;s homes, there should be forgiveness of sins?&#160; Let threats be laid aside; let bonds be loosed, for he who will not loose them will bind himself with them much more disastrously.&#160; For whatsoever one man resolves upon against another, he decrees against himself by his own terms.&#160; Whereas &#8220;blessed are the merciful, for <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p24.1"></A>God</span> shall have mercy on them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_952"></A><A HREF="#fn_952"><FONT SIZE="1">953</FONT></A>
:&#8221;&#160; and He is just and kind in His judgments, allowing some to be in the power of others to this end, that under fair government may be preserved both the profitableness of discipline and the kindliness of clemency, and that no one should dare to refuse that pardon to another&#146;s shortcomings, which he wishes to receive for his own.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p26"></A>VI.&#160; <i>Reconciliation between enemies and alms-giving are also Lenten duties.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p27"></A>Furthermore, as the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p27.1"></A>Lord</span> says, that &#8220;the peacemakers are blessed, because they shall be called sons of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p27.2"></A>God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_953"></A><A HREF="#fn_953"><FONT SIZE="1">954</FONT></A>
</span>,&#8221; let all discords and enmities be laid aside, and let no one think to have a share in the Paschal feast that has neglected to restore brotherly peace.&#160; For with the Father on high, he that is not in charity with the brethren, will not be reckoned in the number of His sons.&#160; Furthermore, in the distribution of alms and care of the poor, let our Christian fast-times be fat and abound; and let each bestow on the weak and destitute those dainties which he denies himself.&#160; Let pains be taken that all may bless <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p28.2"></A>God</span> with one mouth, and let him that gives some portion of substance understand that he is a minister of the Divine mercy; for <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p28.3"></A>God</span> has placed the cause of the poor in the hand of the liberal man; that the sins which are washed away either by the waters of baptism, or the tears of repentance, may be also blotted out by alms-giving; for the Scripture says, &#8220;As water extinguisheth fire, so alms extinguisheth sin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_954"></A><A HREF="#fn_954"><FONT SIZE="1">955</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; Through our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.v.xxv-p29.2"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</p>
