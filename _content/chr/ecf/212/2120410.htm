<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p4"></A>Gregory to Columbus, &amp;c.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p5"></A>Even before receiving thy Fraternity&#146;s letter, I knew thee from the report of thy deserved reputation to be a good servant of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p5.1"></A>God</span>.&#160; And now that I have received it, I understand more fully that what fame had already spread abroad was well founded; and I greatly rejoice in thy deserts, in that thou exhibitest manners and deeds that testify to a praiseworthy life.&#160; Since, then, I feel that these things are conferred on thee by the Supernal Majesty, I congratulate thee; and I bless <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p5.2"></A>God</span> our Creditor, who denies not the gifts of His mercy to His humble servants.&#160; On this account I declare it to be true that thy Fraternity so kindles me with the flame of charity to love thee, and my spirit is so united to thee, that I both desire to see thee and am also with thee in heart, though absent.&#160; Thou perceivest in thine own thoughts that this is so.&#160; For in truth unity of minds in charity has power to unite more than bodily presence can.&#160; Furthermore, that with thy whole mind, thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thou cleavest and art devoted to the Apostolic See I am now assured, as, indeed before thy letter had borne testimony to the fact, I plainly knew.&#160; Wherefore, first addressing thee with the greeting of charity which is due, I exhort thee not to cease to be mindful of what thou hast promised to the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p6"></A>Wherefore be thou urgent with the primate of thy synod&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1497"></A><A HREF="#fn_1497"><FONT SIZE="1">1498</FONT></A>
, that boys be in no wise admitted to sacred orders, lest they fall by so much the more dangerously as they hasten more speedily to mount to higher places.&#160; Let there be no venality in ordination:&#160; let not the influence or entreaty of any persons obtain anything in contravention of these our prohibitions.&#160; For without doubt <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p7.1"></A>God</span> is offended if any one is promoted to sacred orders, not for merit, but by favour (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p7.2"></A>God</span> forbid) or venality.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p8"></A>If, then, thou art aware of these things being done, keep not silence, but oppose them urgently; since, if perchance thou shouldest neglect them, or conceal them when known of, the chain of sin will bind not those alone who do such things, but no light guilt before <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p8.1"></A>God</span> will touch thee also in the matter.&#160; If, then, anything of the kind is committed, it ought to be restrained by canonical punishment, lest so great a wickedness, with sin in others, acquire strength from connivance.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p9"></A>I have, therefore, the sooner given leave of departure to the bearer of these presents, Victorinus, thy Fraternity&#146;s deacon, whom I think to be thy imitator, and whom I have received with charity; and by him I have transmitted to thee for a blessing keys of the blessed Peter, in which something from his chains is included.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p10"></A>Lastly, with regard to the unity and peace of the council which, under <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iii.xxiv-p10.1"></A>God</span>, you are taking measures to assemble, let thy Charity rejoice my mind by informing me of everything particularly.</p>
