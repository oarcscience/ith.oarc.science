<span id="iii.v.viii.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.vii-p2"></span>To Columbus.

<span id="iii.v.viii.vii-p3"></span>Gregory to Columbus, Bishop of
Numidia <span id="fr_1735"></span>[1736](#fn_1735) .

<span id="iii.v.viii.vii-p5"></span>How we may presume on your Charity
we gather from the disposition of our own mind with regard to you.  Nor
do we think that you love the Apostolic See otherwise than as it loves
you.  Whence it must needs be that we should more peculiarly commend
those whom we know to be, as they should be, devoted in the Church of
the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, to you whose life the action
as well as the dignity of a priest adorns, and of whose sincerity we
already hold proof from past experience.

<span id="iii.v.viii.vii-p6"></span>As to our brother, therefore, and
fellow-bishop Paul <span id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736) , the
bearer of these presents, with what billows and adversities he is tossed
in your parts he tells us is not unknown to your Holiness.  And seeing
that he asserts that the complaints against him which you have told us
have come to your ears are not true, but raised against him at the
instigation of his adversaries, and that he trusts to be able by the
help of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.vii-p7.1"></span>Lord</span> to surmount them all, with
the truth to support him and with you to take cognizance, we exhort you,
most beloved brother, that, in whatever points considerations of justice
are clearly on his side, you afford him becomingly the hand of succour,
and aid him with priestly sympathy.  Let, then, no circumstance, <span
id="page_235b">p. 235b</span> <span
id="iii.v.viii.vii-Page_235b"></span>no influence of any persons,
deflect you from studious regard to equity.  But, leaning on the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.vii-p7.2"></span>Lord’s</span> precepts,
set at naught whatever is opposed to rectitude.  In defending one party
or the other insist constantly on justice.  Shrink not from incurring
ill-will, if such there be, in behalf of truth; that thou mayest find in
the advent of our Redeemer so much the greater fruit of reward as, not
neglecting His commands, thou shalt have devoted thyself to the
countenance and defence of justice.  In the month of March, first
Indiction.
