<span id="iii.v.viii.i-Page_231b"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="iii.v.viii.i-p1.1"></span>Book VIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.i-p2"></span><span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.viii.i-p2.1"></span>Epistle I.</span>

<span id="iii.v.viii.i-p3"></span>To Peter, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.viii.i-p4"></span>Gregory to Peter, Bishop of
Corsica <span id="fr_1725"></span>[1726](#fn_1725) .

<span id="iii.v.viii.i-p6"></span>On receiving the letters of your
Fraternity we returned great thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.i-p6.1"></span>God</span>, that you had been so good as
to refresh us with the news of the gathering in of many souls.  And
accordingly let your Fraternity strive anxiously to bring to perfection,
with the help of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.i-p6.2"></span>Lord</span>, the work which you have
begun.  And with regard to those who have once been faithful, but from
negligence or under constraint have returned to the worship of idols,
make haste to bring them back to the faith, imposing on them a penance
of a few days, that they may bewail their guilt, and keep to that to
which they return, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.viii.i-p6.3"></span>God</span> helping them, the more firmly
as they shall have perfectly deplored that from which they now depart;
and with regard to those who have not yet been baptized, let thy
Fraternity make haste, by admonishing, by beseeching, by alarming them
about the coming judgment, and also by giving reasons why they should
not worship stocks and stones, to gather them in to Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.i-p6.4"></span>God</span>; that so, at
His advent, when the strict day of judgment comes, thy Holiness may be
found in the number of the Saints.  For what more profitable work or
more lofty canst thou be engaged in than taking thought for the
quickening and gathering together of souls and bringing in immortal gain
to thy <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.viii.i-p6.5"></span>Lord</span>,
Who has given to thee the post of preaching?

<span id="iii.v.viii.i-p7"></span>Further, we send thy Fraternity fifty
*solidi* for procuring vestments for those who are to be baptized; and
we have also caused to be given to the presbyter of the Church situated
in Mount Negeugnus <span id="fr_1726"></span>[1727](#fn_1726) the
possession which thy Fraternity has asked for, so that its value may be
deducted from the money that he had been accustomed to receive.

<span id="iii.v.viii.i-p9"></span>Further, your Fraternity has asked to
be allowed to make for yourself an episcopal residence in the church
that is not far from the same mountain; which proposal I most gladly
accede to, since the nearer you are, the more will you be able to do
good to the souls that are there.

<span id="iii.v.viii.i-p10"></span>In consideration of your Holiness’s
intercessions for him we have made the bearer of these presents an
acolyte, and have sent him back to attend upon you, in order that, if he
should be of still more service in winning souls, he may be in a
position to be still further advanced.
