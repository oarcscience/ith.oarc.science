<p><a name="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p4"></A>Being exceedingly desirous of observing the festivals of saints, we have thought it needful to address this our letter of direction to thy Experience, informing thee that we have arranged for the dedication with all solemnity, with the help of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p4.1"></A>Lord</span>, in the month of August, of the Oratory of the Blessed Mary lately built in the cell of brethren where the abbot Marinianus is known to preside, to the end that what we have begun may through the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p4.2"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> operation be completed.&#160; But, inasmuch as the poverty of that cell requires that we should assist in that day of festival, we therefore desire thee to give for celebrating the dedication, to be distributed to the poor, ten <i>solidi</i> in gold, thirty <i>amphor&aelig;</i> of wine, two hundred lambs, two <i>orc&aelig;</i> of oil, twelve wethers, and a hundred hens, which may be afterwards charged in thy accounts.&#160; Provide therefore for this being done at once without any delay, that our desires, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxviii-p4.3"></A>God</span> granting it, may take speedy effect.</p>
