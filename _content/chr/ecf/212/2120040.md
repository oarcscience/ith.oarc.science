<span id="ii.iv.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxx-p1.1"></span>Letter XXX.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxx-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxx-p2.1"></span>To Pulcheria Augusta.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxx-p3"></span>Much shorter than, but to nearly the same
effect as, xxxi., which was written on the same day as this.  As xxx.
has a Greek translation accompanying it and is duly dated, whereas xxxi.
has neither, the Ballerinii would seem to be correct in thinking that
xxx. was despatched but did not reach Pulcheria (cf. Lett. xlv. i.) and
that xxxi. was for some reason never used.  Of the two we have printed
xxxi. by preference, as being the fuller discussion of the subject.
