<p><a name="iii.v.i.xxviii-p4"></A>The venerable Paulinus bishop of the city of Taurum (<i>Taurianum in Brutia</i>), has told us that his monks have been scattered by reason of barbaric invasions, and that they are now wandering through the whole of Sicily, and that, being without a ruler, they neither have a care of their souls, nor pay attention to the discipline of their profession.&#160; On this account we enjoin thee to search out with all care and diligence, and collect together, these same monks, and to place them with the said bishop, their ruler, in the monastery of Saint Theodorus situate in the city of Messana, that both such as are there now, whom we find to be in need of a ruler, and those of his congregation whom you may have found and brought back, may be able, under his leadership, to serve the Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxviii-p4.1"></A>Lord</span> together.&#160; Know also that we have signified this matter to the venerable Felix, bishop of the same city, lest anything ordained in the diocese committed to him should be disturbed without his knowledge.</p>
