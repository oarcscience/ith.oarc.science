<p class="c30"><a name="iii.iv.iii.xi-p2"></A>How intent the ruler ought to be on meditations in the Sacred Law.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.iv.iii.xi-p3"></A>But all this is duly executed by a ruler, if, inspired by the spirit of heavenly fear and love, he meditate daily on the precepts of Sacred Writ, that the words of Divine admonition may restore in him the power of solicitude and of provident circumspection with regard to the celestial life, which familiar intercourse with men continually destroys; and that one who is drawn to oldness of life by secular society may by the aspiration of compunction be ever renewed to love of the spiritual country.&#160; For the heart runs greatly to waste in the midst of human talk; and, since it is undoubtedly evident that, when driven by the tumults of external occupations, it loses its balance and falls, one ought incessantly to take care that through keen pursuit of instruction it may rise again.&#160; For hence it is that Paul admonishes his disciple who had been put over the flock, saying, <i>Till I come, give attendance to reading</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#013">1 Tim. iv. 13</a><a name="iii.iv.iii.xi-p3.1"></A>).&#160; Hence David says, <i>How have I loved Thy Law, O <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.iii.xi-p3.2"></A>Lord</span>!&#160; It is my meditation all the day</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#097">Ps. cix. 97</a><a name="iii.iv.iii.xi-p3.3"></A>).&#160; Hence the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.iv.iii.xi-p3.4"></A>Lord</span> commanded Moses concerning the carrying of the ark, saying. <i>Thou shalt make four rings of gold, which thou shalt put in the four corners of the ark, and thou shalt make staves of shittim-wood, and overlay them with gold, and shalt put them through the rings which are by the sides of the ark, that it may be borne with them, and they shall always be in the rings, nor shall they ever be drawn out from them</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#012">Exod. xxv. 12</a><a name="iii.iv.iii.xi-p3.5"></A>, <i>seq.</i>).&#160; What but the holy Church is figured by the ark?&#160; To which four rings of gold in the four corners are ordered to be adjoined, because, in that it is thus extended towards the four quarters of the globe, it is declared undoubtedly to be equipped for journeying with the four books of the holy Gospel.&#160; And staves of shittim-wood are made, and are put through the same rings for carrying, because strong and persevering teachers, as incorruptible pieces of timber, are to be sought for, who by cleaving ever to instruction out of the sacred volumes may declare the unity of the holy Church, and, as it were, carry the ark by being let into its rings.&#160; For indeed to carry the ark by means of staves is through preaching to bring the holy Church before the rude minds of unbelievers by means of good teachers.&#160; And these are also ordered to be overlaid with gold, that, while they are resonant to others in discourse, they may also themselves glitter in the splendour of their lives.&#160; Of whom it is further fitly added, <i>They shall always be in the rings, nor shall they ever be drawn out from them;</i> because it is surely necessary that those who attend upon the office of preaching should not recede from the study of sacred lore.&#160; For to this end it is that the staves are ordered to be always in the rings, that, when occasion requires the ark to be carried, no tardiness in carrying may arise from the staves having to be put in; because, that is to say, when a pastor is enquired of by his subordinates on any spiritual matter, it is exceedingly ignominious, should he then go about to learn, when he ought to solve the question.&#160; But let the staves remain ever in the rings, that teachers, ever meditating in their own hearts the words of Sacred Writ, may lift without delay the ark of the covenant; as will be the case if they teach at once whatever   <A NAME="page_24b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.iv.iii.xi-Page_24b"></A>is required.&#160; Hence the first Pastor of the Church well admonishes all other pastors saying, <i>Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#015">1 Pet. iii. 15</a><a name="iii.iv.iii.xi-p3.6"></A>):&#160; as though he should say plainly, That no delay may hinder the carrying of the ark, let the staves never be withdrawn from the rings.</p>
