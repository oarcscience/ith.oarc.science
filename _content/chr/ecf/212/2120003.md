<span id="ii.ii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.ii-p3.1"></span>Except</span> for such valuable help—chiefly
however in the way of comment and explanation—as Canon Bright’s volume
(S. Leo on the Incarnation) has supplied, both the selection and the
translation of the Letters and Sermons of Leo Magnus are practically
original.  It is even more difficult to feel satisfied oneself, than to
satisfy others either with a selection from a great man’s works or with
a translation of them.  The powers of Leo as a preacher both of doctrine
and of practice are very remarkable, and in my anxiety to keep within
the limits imposed by the publishers, I have erred in presenting too few
rather than too many of the Sermons to the English reader.  Only those
that are generally held genuine are represented, though several of the
doubtful ones are fine sermons, and those translated are in most cases
no better than those omitted.  Even when the same thought is repeated
again and again (as is often the case), it is almost always clothed in
such different language, and surrounded with so many other thoughts of
value, that every sermon has an almost equal claim to be selected.

<span id="ii.ii-p4"></span>With regard to the Letters, the series
connected with the Eutychian controversy—the chief occupation of Leo’s
episcopate—is given nearly complete, whereas only specimens of his mode
of dealing with other matters have been selected for presentation.  With
one or two exceptions, however, I feel more confident about the Letters
than about the Sermons that the omitted are less important than the
included.  I wish I could make even a similar boast about the merits of
the translation.

<span id="ii.ii-p5"></span>The text rendered is for the most part that
of the Ballerinii as given by Migne (Patrologie, Vol. LIV.), though a
more critical edition is much to be desired.
