<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xx-p3"></A>Gregory to Marinianus, Bishop of Ravenna&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1651"></A><A HREF="#fn_1651"><FONT SIZE="1">1652</FONT></A>

<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xx-p5"></A>We wonder why the discernment of thy Fraternity should have been so changed in a short time that it does not consider what it asks for.&#160; On this account we grieve, since thou affordest manifest proof that the words of evil counsellors have availed with thee more than the study of divine lore has profited thee.&#160; And, when thou oughtest to be protecting monasteries, and with all thy power congregating the religious therein so as to make gain from the gathering together of souls, thou art on the contrary desiring to exercise thyself in oppressing them, as thy letters testify; and, what is worse, art trying to make us partakers in thy fault; to wit, in wishing, with our consent, to oppress the monastery which thy predecessor founded under the name of looking after its property and business affairs.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xx-p6"></A>For thou oughtest to call to mind that, in thy presence, and in the presence also of sundry of thy presbyters, deacons, and clerics, we granted, as they requested, a precept contrary to the testament of thy predecessor.&#160; Yet, though the disposition he had made with regard to the monastery itself was still therein confirmed, thou now dissemblest this, and demandest of us that we should order the contrary.&#160; And indeed we know that this device is not thine own; but, when thou refusest not to listen to those who say incongruous things, thou injurest not only thine own reputation, but also souls.&#160; Since, then, I love thee much, I urgently admonish thee&#8212;consider this attentively&#8212;that thou care not more for money than for souls.&#160; The former should be regarded collaterally; but the latter should be regarded with the whole bent of the mind, and vehemently striven after.&#160; On this spend vigilantly thy labour and solicitude, since our Redeemer seeks from the priest&#146;s office not gold, but souls.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xx-p7"></A>Further, it has reached our ears that monasteries which are constituted under thy Fraternity are oppressed by importunities and various annoyances from the clergy.&#160; That this may no longer be so, restrain it by strict prohibition, to the end that the monks who live therein may be able to exult freely in the praises of our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xx-p7.1"></A>God</span>.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xx-p8"></A>With regard to the clerics Romanus and Dominicus, who presumed with rash daring to depart from this city without our blessing, though they were to have been stricken with heavier punishment, nevertheless such relaxation ought to be made in a spirit of kindness that they be urged to come back to their duty.&#160; The month of April, Indict. 14.</p>
