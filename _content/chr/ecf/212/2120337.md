<span id="iii.v.i.xxxv-p4"></span>Gregory to Honoratus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxv-p5"></span>Since we have undertaken, however
undeserving, a place of government, it is our duty to succour our
brethren in need, so far as our power extends.  Januarius, then, our
brother and fellow-bishop of the metropolitan city of Caralis
(*Cagliari*), has been here in the city of Rome, and informed us that
the glorious *magister militum*, Theodorus, who is known to have
received the dukedom of the island of Sardinia, is doing many things
there contrary to the commands of our most pious lords, whereby with
fitting clemency and gentleness they removed many hardships of
proprietors, or of citizens of their empire.  Wherefore we desire you at
a suitable time to represent the case to our most pious lords in
accordance with what the provincials of the aforesaid island justly and
reasonably demand; seeing that on a previous occasion also their sacred
imperial letters were sent to the glorious *Magister militum* Edancius,
who was in the seventh indiction duke of Sardinia, in which they ordered
all these present grievances to be redressed, to the end that their
commands, proceeding from the bountifulness of their piety, might be
observed unshaken by dukes who might come in course of time to be in
power, and that the benefit thereof might not be squandered away by
administrators; that so a quiet life might be led under the clement
empire of our lords, and for the ordinance which with tranquil mind they
grant to their subjects they might receive multiplied compensation at
the coming of the eternal judge.
