<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vii.xi-p2"></A>To Marinianus, Archbishop.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.xi-p3"></A>Gregory to Marinianus, Archbishop of Ravenna&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1693"></A><A HREF="#fn_1693"><FONT SIZE="1">1694</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.xi-p5"></A>Your Fraternity has been long aware after what manner the Church of Ariminum has been hitherto deprived of pastoral government by reason of the known bodily affliction of the priest who was ordained by us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1694"></A><A HREF="#fn_1694"><FONT SIZE="1">1695</FONT></A>
.&#160; Now we, moved by the prayers of the inhabitants of that place, having frequently exhorted him to return with the help of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xi-p6.1"></A>Lord</span> to his Church, if he should feel himself relieved from this affliction of the head whereby he was kept away, he has been expected now for four years since the leave of absence given him.&#160; And, when at the instance of clergy and citizens who have come from thence and urged us with  <A NAME="page_218b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 218b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.vii.xi-Page_218b"></A>entreaties, we urgently exhorted him to return with them, the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xi-p6.2"></A>Lord</span> helping him, if able to do so, he begged of us by a supplication in writing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1695"></A><A HREF="#fn_1695"><FONT SIZE="1">1696</FONT></A>
, that, inasmuch as by reason of this affliction wherewith he is held he can in no wise rise to the government of the same Church, or to the office undertaken by him, we should ordain a bishop to this same Church.&#160; Hence, seeing that the charge laid upon us of caring for all the Churches constrains us to see that pastoral guardianship be no longer wanting to the flock of the faithful, and being compelled by their entreaties, and by his renunciation on the ground of his own inability, we have resolved that a bishop should be ordained to this same Church of Ariminum:&#160; and, having issued our precept according to custom, we have not failed to admonish the clergy and people of the same Church, to the end that they may concur with concordant provision to choose for themselves a prelate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1696"></A><A HREF="#fn_1696"><FONT SIZE="1">1697</FONT></A>
.&#160; We therefore exhort your Fraternity that him whom all with one consent shall choose (as they themselves also have requested leave to do) you cause to be summoned before you; and test him by cautious enquiry on all sides.&#160; And if, by favour of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xi-p8.1"></A>Lord</span>, none of the things that are punished with death in the text of the Heptateuch are found in him, and if, on the report of trustworthy persons, his life should approve itself to you, send him to us with the certification of his election, adding your own letter of testification, to the end that a prelate of this same Church may, under the ordering of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xi-p8.2"></A>Lord</span>, be by us consecrated.</p>
