<p><a name="iii.v.i.xxxiii-p4"></A>Though the opportunity of a suitable time and suitable persons has failed me so far for writing to your Fraternity and duly returning your salutation, the result has been that I can now at one and the same time acquit myself of what is due to love and fraternal relationship, and also touch on the complaint of certain persons which has reached us, with respect to the way in which the souls of the erring should be saved.&#160; Very many, though indeed of the Jewish religion, resident in this province, and from time to time travelling for various matters of business to the regions of Massilia, have apprized us, that many of the Jews settled in those parts have been brought to the font of baptism more by force than by preaching.&#160; Now, I consider the intention in such cases to be worthy of praise, and allow that it proceeds from the love of our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxiii-p4.1"></A>Lord</span>.&#160; But I fear lest this same intention, unless adequate enforcement from Holy Scripture accompany it, should either have no profitable result, or even (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxiii-p4.2"></A>God</span> forbid) the loss of the souls which we wish to save should further ensue.&#160; For, when any one is brought to the font of baptism, not by the sweetness of preaching, but by compulsion, he returns to his former superstition, and dies the worse from having been born again.&#160; Let, therefore, your Fraternity stir up such men by frequent preaching, to the end that through the sweetness of their teacher they may desire the more to change their old life.&#160; For so our purpose is rightly accomplished, and the mind of the convert returns not again to his former vomit.&#160; Wherefore discourse must be addressed to them, such as may burn up the thorns of error in them, and illuminate what is dark in them by preaching, so that your Fraternity may through your frequent admonition receive a reward for them, and lead them, so far as <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.i.xxxiii-p4.3"></A>God</span> may grant it, to the regeneration of a new life.</p>
