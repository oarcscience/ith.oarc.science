<span id="ii.iv.xxii"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxii-p1.1"></span>Letter XXII <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220) .</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p3"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxii-p3.1"></span>The first from Flavian, Bp. of
Constantinople to Pope Leo.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p4"></span>To the most holy and God-loving father
and fellow-bishop, Leo, Flavian greeting in the<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxii-p4.1"></span>Lord</span>.

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p5"></span>I.  *The designs of the devil have led
Eutyches astray.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p6"></span>There is nothing which can stay the
devil’s wickedness, that “restless evil, full of deadly poison <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221) .”  Above and below it “goes about,”
seeking “whom it may” strike, dismay, and “devour <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222) .”  Whence to watch, to be sober unto
prayer, to draw near to <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxii-p8.2"></span>God</span>, to eschew foolish questionings,
to follow the fathers and not to go beyond the eternal bounds, this we
have learnt from Holy Writ.  And so I give up the excess of grief and
abundant tears over the capture of one of the clergy who are under me,
and whom I could not save nor snatch from the wolf, although I was ready
to lay down my life for him.  How was he caught, how did he leap away,
hating the voice of the caller and turning aside also from the memory of
the Fathers and thoroughly detesting their paths.  And thus I proceed
with my account.

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p9"></span>II.  *The seductions of heretics capture
the unwary.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p10"></span>There are some “in sheep’s clothing,
but inwardly they are ravening wolves <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223) :”  whom we know by their fruit. 
These men seem indeed at first to be of us, but they are not of us: 
“for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with
us <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224) .”  But when they have spewed
out their impiety, throwing out the guile that is in them, and seizing
the weaker ones, and those who have their senses unpractised in the
divine utterances, they carry them along with themselves to destruction,
wresting and doing despite to the Fathers’ doctrines, just as they do
the Holy Scriptures also to their own destruction:  whom we must be
forewarned of and take heed lest some should be misled by their
wickedness and shaken in their firmness.  “For they have sharpened their
tongues like serpents:  adder’s poison is under their lips <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225) ,” as the prophet has cried out about
them.

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p14"></span>III.  *Eutyches’ heresy stated.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p15"></span>Such a one, therefore, has now shown
himself amongst us, Eutyches, for many years a presbyter and
archimandrite <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226) , pretending to
hold the same belief as ours, and to have the right Faith in him: 
indeed he resists the blasphemy of Nestorius, and feigns a controversy
with him, but the exposition of the Faith composed by the 318 holy
fathers, and the letter that Cyril of holy memory wrote to Nestorius,
and one by the same author on the same subject to the Easterns, these
writings, to which <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> <span
id="ii.iv.xxii-Page_35"></span>all have given their assent, he has tried
to upset, and revive the old evil dogmas of the blasphemous Valentinus
and Apollinaris.  He has not feared the warning of the True King: 
“Whoso shall cause one of the least of these little ones to stumble, it
was better that a millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he
should be sunk in the depth of the sea. <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227) ”  But casting away all shame, and
shaking off the cloak which covered his error <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228) , he openly in our holy synod
persisted in saying that our <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxii-p18.3"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ ought not to be
understood by us as having two natures after His incarnation in one
substance and in one person:  nor yet that the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxii-p18.4"></span>Lord’s</span> flesh was of the same
substance with us, as if assumed from us and united to <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxii-p18.5"></span>God</span> the Word
hypostatically:  but he said that the Virgin who bare him was indeed of
the same substance with us according to the flesh, but the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxii-p18.6"></span>Lord</span> Himself did
not assume from her flesh of the same substance with us:  but the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxii-p18.7"></span>Lord’s</span> body was not
a man’s body, although that which issued from the Virgin was a human
body, resisting all the expositions of the holy Fathers.

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p19"></span>IV.  *He has sent Leo the minutes of
their proceedings that he may see all the details.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p20"></span>But not to make my letter too long by
detailing everything, we have sent your holiness the proceedings which
some time since we took in the matter:  therein we deprived him as
convicted on these charges, of his priesthood, of the management of his
monastery and of our communion:  in order that your holiness also
knowing the facts of his case may make his wickedness manifest to all
the God-loving bishops who are under your reverence; lest perchance if
they do not know the views which he holds, and of which he has been
openly convicted, they may be found to be in correspondence with him as
a fellow-believer by letter or by other means.  I and those who are with
me give much greeting to you and to all the brotherhood in Christ.  The
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.iv.xxii-p20.1"></span>Lord</span> keep you
in safety and prayer for us, O most <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iv.xxii-p20.2"></span>God-</span>Loving Father. <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229)

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p2"></span> There are two Latin versions of the
original Gk. of this letter, an older and a later:  the later, as being
more accurate, is here translated, though Canon Bright would seem to be
right (n. 139) in saying that we must think of Leo as writing the Tome
(Lett. XXVIII.) with the older Latin version of Flavian’s letter before
him.

<span id="ii.iv.xxii-p21"></span> This was the letter “which was
somewhat unaccountably delayed in its transit to Rome” (Bright), which
reached Leo after XXIII. was written, and to which Leo refers in the
Tome, chap. i., *litteris, quas miramur fuisse tam seras*.  Bright’s
note 139 should be read throughout as a clear exposition of the
preliminary steps in the controversy.
