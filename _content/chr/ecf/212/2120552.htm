<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p4"></A>Gregory to Anastasius, &amp;c.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p5"></A>That a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#035">Matt. 12:35</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#045">Luke 6:45</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p5.1"></A>), this thy Charity has shewn, both in thy habitual life and lately also in thy epistle; wherein I find two persons at issue with regard to virtues; that is to say, thyself contending for charity, and another for fear and humility.&#160; And, though occupied with many things, though ignorant of the Greek language, I have nevertheless sat as judge of your contention.&#160; But, in very truth, thou hast, in my judgment, thyself conquered thy opponent by the apostolical sentence, which I proffered to you during your contention, <i>That there is no fear in charity,, but perfect charity casteth out fear; because fear hath torment.&#160; He that feareth is not made perfect in charity</i>.&#160; I know then how much thy Fraternity is made perfect in charity.&#160; And, since thou lovest Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p5.2"></A>God</span> much, thou oughtest to presume on thy neighbour much.&#160; For it is not places or ranks that make us neighbours to our Creator; but either our good deserts join us to Him, or our bad deserts separate us from  <A NAME="page_225b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 225b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.vii.xx-Page_225b"></A>Him.&#160; Since, then, it is still uncertain what any one is inwardly, how was it that thou wast afraid to write, ignorant as thou art as to which of us two is the superior?&#160; And indeed that thou livest well I know, but I am conscious myself of being burdened by many sins.&#160; And though thou art thyself a sinner, still thou art much better than I, since thou bearest thine own sins only, but I those also of the persons committed to me.&#160; In this, then, I look upon thee as lofty, in this I look upon thee as great, that in a great place and lofty before human eyes thou hast not felt thyself advanced at all.&#160; For therein, while honour is paid thee by men outwardly, thy mind is sunk into depths, because burdened by distracting cares.&#160; But to thee Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p5.3"></A>God</span> has done as it is written; <i>He hath laid down ascents in the heart, in the valley of tears</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006">Psa. 84.6</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p5.4"></A>).&#160; To me, however, thou mightest have appeared far loftier, far more sublime, hadst thou never undertaken the leadership of the monastery which is called Neas, seeing that in that monastery, as I hear, there is indeed an appearance of monks kept up, but many secular things are done under the garb of sanctity.&#160; But even to this I shall think that heavenly grace has brought thee, if what in that place displeases Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p5.5"></A>God</span> should be corrected under thy guidance.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p6"></A>But, since there have been wont to be quarrels between the father of this same monastery and the pastor of the Church of Jerusalem, I believe that Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p6.1"></A>God</span> has willed that thy Love and my most holy brother and fellow-priest Amos should be at the same time at Jerusalem for this end, that the quarrels which I have spoken of should be put an end to.&#160; Shew, then, now how much you loved before.&#160; For I know that both of you are abstinent, both learned, both humble; whence the glory of our Saviour must needs be praised, according to the language of the Psalm, in timbrel and chorus (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#004">Ps. cl. 4</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p6.2"></A>).&#160; For in a timbrel the sound from the skin is dry, but in a chorus there is a concord of voices.&#160; What therefore is denoted by a timbrel but abstinence, and what by a chorus but unanimity?&#160; Since then by abstinence ye praise the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p6.3"></A>Lord</span> in timbrel, I beg that by unanimity ye praise Him in chorus.&#160; The Truth also in person says, <i>Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#050">Mark ix. 50</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p6.4"></A>).&#160; What is denoted by salt but wisdom, as Paul attests, who says, <i>Let your speech be alway in grace, seasoned with salt</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#006">Col. iv. 6</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p6.5"></A>)?&#160; Since, then, we know that you have salt through the teaching of the heavenly word, it remains that through the grace of charity you keep with all your hearts peace between yourselves.&#160; All this I say, dearest brother, because I love you both exceedingly, and am much afraid lest the sacrifices of your prayers should be stained by any dissension between you.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p7"></A>The blessing which you sent, first by Exhilaratus the <i>Secundicerius</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1714"></A><A HREF="#fn_1714"><FONT SIZE="1">1715</FONT></A>
, and afterwards by Sabinianus the deacon, I received with thanksgiving, since from a holy place it became you to send holy things, and to shew by your very gift whom you serve continually.&#160; May Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p8.1"></A>God</span> protect you with His right hand, and preserve you scatheless from all evils.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.vii.xx-p3"></A> This epistle appears to have been in reply to one from a presbyter.&#160; Anastasius (<i>al</i>. Athanasius), of Jerusalem announcing his promotion to the abbacy of a monastery there.&#160; There had been, it seems, a standing feud between the abbots of this monastery and the bishops of Jerusalem, the continuance of which Gregory gracefully deprecates in the course of his letter.</p>
