<span id="iii.v.vii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.ix-p2"></span>To George, Presbyter.

<span id="iii.v.vii.ix-p3"></span>Gregory to George, Presbyter, and to
Theodore, deacon, of the Church of Constantinople.

<span id="iii.v.vii.ix-p4"></span>Mindful of your goodness and charity,
I greatly blame myself, that I gave you leave to return so soon:  but,
since I saw you pressing me importunately once and again for leave to
go, I considered that it might be a serious matter for your Love to
tarry with us longer.  But, after I had learnt that you had lingered so
long on your journey owing to the winter season, I confess that I was
sorry that you had been sent away so soon.  For, if your Love was unable
to accomplish your intended journey, it had been better that you had
lingered with me than away from me.

<span id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5"></span>Moreover, after your departure I
learnt from information given me by my most beloved sons the deacons
that your Love had said that our Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> and Saviour Jesus Christ, when
He descended into hell, saved all who there acknowledged Him as <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.2"></span>God</span>, and delivered
them from the pains due to them.  With regard to this subject I desire
that your Charity should think very differently.  For, when He descended
into hell, He delivered through His grace those only who both believed
that He should come and observed His precepts in their lives.  For it is
evident that after the incarnation of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.3"></span>Lord</span> no one can be saved, even of
those who hold His faith, who have not the life of faith; since it is
written, *They acknowledge that they know <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.4"></span>God</span>, but in deeds they deny Him*
([Tit. i. 16](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016)<span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.5"></span>).  And John says, *He that saith that he
knows Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar* ([1 John ii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004)<span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.6"></span>).  James also, the brother of the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.7"></span>Lord</span>, writes
saying, *Faith without works is dead* ([Jam. ii.
20](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020)<span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.8"></span>).  If, then, believers now are not saved
without good works, while the unbelieving and reprobate without good
action were saved by our <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.9"></span>Lord</span> descending into hell, then the
lot of those who never saw the incarnation of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.10"></span>Lord</span> was better than that of these
who have been born after the mystery of His incarnation.  But what
fatuity it argues to say or think this the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.11"></span>Lord</span> Himself testifies to His
disciples, when He says, *Many kings and prophets have desired to see
the things which ye see, and have not seen them* ([Matt.
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017), [Luke
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024)<span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.12"></span>).  But, that I may not <span
id="page_217b">p. 217b</span> <span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-Page_217b"></span>detain your Love with argument of my
own, learn what Philaster, in the book which he wrote about heresies,
says about this heresy.  His words are these; “They are heretics who say
that the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.13"></span>Lord</span> descended into hell, and
announced himself after death to all who were already there, so that in
acknowledging Him there they might be saved; seeing that this is
contrary to the prophet David where he says, *But in hell who shall
acknowledge thee* ([Ps. vi. 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006)<span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.14"></span>)?  And to the Apostle; *As many as have
sinned without law shall perish without law* ([Rom. ii.
12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012)<span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.15"></span>).”  And with his words the blessed
Augustine also agrees in the book which he wrote about heresies.

<span id="iii.v.vii.ix-p6"></span>Considering, therefore, all these
things, hold ye nothing but what the true faith teaches through the
Catholic Church: namely, that the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.1"></span>Lord</span> in descending into hell
rescued from infernal durance those only whom while living in the flesh
He preserved through His grace in faith and good conduct.  For in that
which He says in the Gospel, *When I shall be lifted up from the earth,
I will draw all to myself* ([John xii.
32](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032)<span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.2"></span>), He means all that are elect.  For one
could not be drawn to <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.3"></span>God</span> after death who had separated
himself from <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.4"></span>God</span> by evil living.  May Almighty
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.5"></span>God</span> keep you
under His protection, that, wherever ye are, ye may feel in soul and
body the aid of His grace.
