id="iii.v.vi.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxvi-p2"></span>To Venantius, Patrician.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxvi-p3"></span>Gregory to Venantius, Patrician, and
Ex-monk <span id="fr_1660"></span>[1661](#fn_1660) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxvi-p5"></span>Your communication to us has found us
much distressed from having become aware that offence has arisen between
you and John our brother and fellow-bishop, in whose agreement with you
we were desirous of rejoicing.  For, whatever the cause may have been,
rage ought not to have broken out to such a pitch that your armed men,
as we have heard, should have burst into the episcopal palace, and
committed divers evil deeds in a hostile manner, and that this affair
should meanwhile separate you from his paternal charity.  Could not the
dispute, whatever it may have been, have been quietly arranged, so that
neither party might suffer disadvantage, nor good feeling be disturbed? 
Now it is not unknown to us of what gravity, of what holiness, of what
gentleness our above-named brother is.  Whence we gather that, unless
excessive force of vexation had compelled him, his Fraternity would by
no means have resorted to the measure by which you say that you are
aggrieved.  We, however, on hearing of it by letter from him, at once
wrote to him, admonishing him to receive your offerings as before, and
not only to allow masses to be celebrated in your house, but, if you
wish it, even to officiate himself, and that he ought to have prosecuted
his cause without breach of charity.  And, inasmuch as we wish none to
come or continue to be at variance, we have taken care to renew this
same admonition.  Hence it is necessary, dearest son, that you, as
becomes sons, should shew him the reverence due to a priest, and not
provoke his spirit to anger.  For with whom will you have assured
goodwill, if (which <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxvi-p5.1"></span>God</span> forbid) you are at variance
with your priest?  Wherefore, putting away swelling of spirit, try ye so
to transact the causes that ye have one with another that both charity
may remain inviolate, and what is to your mutual advantage may be
peaceably attained.
