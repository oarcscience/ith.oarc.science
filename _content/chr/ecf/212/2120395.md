<span id="iii.v.iii.ix-p2"></span>*To Savinus, Subdeacon* <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479) .

<span id="iii.v.iii.ix-p4"></span>Gregory to Savinus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.iii.ix-p5"></span>Bad men have gone forth and disturbed
your minds, understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm,
pretending that in the times of Justinian of pious memory something was
detracted from the faith of the holy synod of Chalcedon, which with all
faith and all devotion we venerate.  And in like manner all the four
synods of the holy universal Church we receive as we do the four books
of the holy Gospel.  But concerning the persons with respect to whom
something had been done after the close of the synod, there was
something ventilated in the times of Justinian of pious memory:  yet so
that neither was the faith in any respect violated, nor anything else
done with regard to these same persons but what had been determined at
the same holy synod of Chalcedon.  Moreover, we anathematize any one who
presumes to detract anything from the definition of the faith which was
promulgated in the said synod, or, as though by amending it, to change
its meaning:  but, as it was there promulged, so in all respects we
guard it.  Thee, therefore, most dear son, it becomes to return to the
unity of Holy Church, that thou mayest end thy days in peace; lest the
malignant spirit, who cannot prevail against thee through thy other
works, may from this cause find a way at the day of thy departure of
barring thy entrance into the heavenly Kingdom.

was.  The Epistle refers to the condemnation of the *Three Chapters* by
the fifth General Council.  See *Proleg*. p. xi.
