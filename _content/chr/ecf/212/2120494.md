id="iii.v.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>Epistle IX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vi.viii-p2"></span>To Donus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.vi.viii-p3"></span>Gregory to Donus, Bishop of Messana
(*Messene*).

<span id="iii.v.vi.viii-p4"></span>Moved by the benevolence of the
Apostolic See, and by the order of ancient custom, we have thought fit
to grant to thee, who art known to have undertaken the office of
government in the Church of Messana, the use of the pallium; to wit, at
such times and in such manner as we dispute not that thy predecessor
used it; at the same time warning thee that, as thou rejoicest in having
received from us a decoration of this kind to the honour of thy priestly
office, so also thou strive, by probity of manners and deeds, to adorn,
to the glory of Christ, the office which thou hast undertaken under our
authority.  For so wilt thou be conspicuous for decorations mutually
answering to each other, if with such an habiliment of the body as this
all good qualities of thy soul also agree.  For all the privileges which
are known to have been granted of old to thy Church we confirm by our
authority, and decree that they shall continue inviolate.
