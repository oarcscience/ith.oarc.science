<span id="iii.v.vi.xxvii-p2"></span>To John, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxvii-p3"></span>Gregory to John, Bishop of
Syracuse <span id="fr_1661"></span>[1662](#fn_1661) .

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxvii-p5"></span>Although there may have been cause
to provoke the spirit of your Fraternity not unreasonably to anger, so
that you would neither receive the offerings of the Lord Venantius nor
allow the sacred solemnities of mass to be celebrated in his house, yet,
inasmuch as our earthly interests should be prosecuted in such a manner
that no quarrel may avail to sever us from the bond of charity, we
therefore exhort your Holiness, as we have already written, that you
should both receive the offerings of the aforesaid man with all
sweetness and God-pleasing sincerity, and allow the mysteries of the
mass to be performed in his house; and that, as we have written, you
should, if perchance he should wish it, go there in person, and by
celebrating mass with him renew your former friendly feeling.  For it is
your duty to bestow priestly affection on sons, though still, in causes
that may arise, by no means to pretermit, as reason approves, the
jurisdiction of your Church.  Wherefore, considering this, it is
necessary that your Fraternity should try so to demean yourself with
discreet moderation with respect to these matters as both to transact
advantageously what the nature of the business requires, and not to
recede from the grace of paternal charity.
