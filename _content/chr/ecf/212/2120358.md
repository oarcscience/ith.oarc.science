<span id="iii.v.ii.iii-p2"></span>*To Maximianus, Bishop of
Syracuse* <span id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398) .

<span id="iii.v.ii.iii-p4"></span>Gregory to Maximianus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.iii-p5"></span>We execute more efficiently our
heavenly commission, if we share our burdens with our brethren.  For
this cause we appoint thee, our most reverend brother and fellow-bishop,
to have administration over all the churches of Sicily in the name of
the Apostolical See, so that whosoever there is reckoned as being in a
condition of religion may by our authority be subject to thy Fraternity,
to the end that it may not hereafter be necessary for them to make such
long sea-voyages in resorting to us for slight causes.  But if by any
chance there are matters of difficulty which can by no means be settled
by the judgment of thy Fraternity, in these only let our judgment be
solicited, that so we may occupy ourselves more efficaciously in greater
causes, being relieved from the least.  And be it understood that we
give this delegation of authority, not to thy place, but to thy person,
because we have learnt from thy past life what we may presume of thee in
thy future conduct.

<span id="iii.v.ii.iii-p6"></span>The month of December, the tenth
Indiction.

<span id="iii.v.ii.iii-p3"></span> Maximianus had been a monk, and for a
time abbot, in Gregory’s monastery of St. Andrew at Rome, had
accompanied him to Constantinople, and been recommended by him soon
after his own accession, and elected Bishop of Syracuse (*Joan. Diac.
Vit. S. Greg*. ii. 11, 12).  He was highly esteemed by Gregory, and
mentioned in his Dialogues as having been miraculously delivered from
shipwreck on his return from Constantinople to Rome (*Dialog*. iii. 36. 
Cf. *Hom*. 34 *in Evang*.).  His appointment now as delegate of the
Roman See in Sicily would relieve Peter the subdeacon of his temporary
jurisdiction over the ecclesiastics there.  Maximianus died in November,
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.iii-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span> 594. 
See V. 17, 22.  It is to be observed that the general authority now
given to Maximianus was granted to him personally, and not permanently
to the See of Syracuse.
