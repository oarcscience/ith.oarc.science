<p class="c26"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p2"></A><span class="c4"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p2.1"></A>To Flavian commonly called &#8220;the Tome.&#8221;</span></p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p3"></A>I.&#160; <i>Eutyches has been driven into his error by presumption and ignorance</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">244</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p5"></A>Having read your letter, beloved, at the late arrival of which we are surprised&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">245</FONT></A>
, and having perused the detailed account of the bishops&#146; acts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">246</FONT></A>
, we have at last found out what the scandal was which had arisen among you against the purity of the Faith:&#160; and what before seemed concealed has now been unlocked and laid open to our view:&#160; from which it is shown that Eutyches, who used to seem worthy of all respect in virtue of his priestly office, is very unwary and exceedingly ignorant, so that it is even of him that the prophet has said:&#160; &#8220;he refused to understand so as to do well:&#160; he thought upon iniquity in his bed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">247</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; But what more iniquitous than to hold blasphemous opinions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">248</FONT></A>
, and not to give way to those who are wiser and more learned than ourself.&#160; Now into this unwisdom fall they who, finding themselves hindered from knowing the truth by some obscurity, have recourse not to the prophets&#146; utterances, not to the Apostles&#146; letters, nor to the injunctions of the Gospel but to their own selves:&#160; and thus they stand out as masters of error because they were never disciples of truth.&#160; For what learning has he acquired about the pages of the New and Old Testament, who has not even grasped the rudiments of the Creed?&#160; And that which, throughout the world, is professed by the mouth of every one who is to be born again&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">249</FONT></A>
, is not yet taken in by the heart of this old man.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p11"></A>II.&#160; <i>Concerning the twofold nativity and nature of Christ.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p12"></A>Not knowing, therefore, what he was bound to think concerning the incarnation of the Word of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p12.1"></A>God</span>, and not wishing to gain the light of knowledge by researches through the length  <A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.xxviii-Page_39"></A>and breadth of the Holy Scriptures, he might at least have listened attentively to that general and uniform confession, whereby the whole body of the faithful confess that they <i>believe in <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p12.2"></A>God</span> the Father Almighty, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">250</FONT></A>
<i>, our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p13.2"></A>Lord</span>, who was born of the Holy Spirit and</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">251</FONT></A>
<i>the Virgin Mary.</i>&#160; By which three statements the devices of almost all heretics are overthrown.&#160; For not only is <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p14.1"></A>God</span> believed to be both Almighty and the Father, but the Son is shown to be co-eternal with Him, differing in nothing from the Father because He is <i><span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p14.2"></A>God</span> from <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p14.3"></A>God</span></i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_251"><FONT SIZE="1">252</FONT></A>
, Almighty from Almighty, and being born from the Eternal one is co-eternal with Him; not later in point of time, not lower in power, not unlike in glory, not divided in essence:&#160; but at the same time the only begotten of the eternal Father was born eternal of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary.&#160; And this nativity which took place in time took nothing from, and added nothing to that divine and eternal birth, but expended itself wholly on the restoration of man who had been deceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">253</FONT></A>
:&#160; in order that he might both vanquish death and overthrow by his strength&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">254</FONT></A>
, the Devil who possessed the power of death.&#160; For we should not now be able to overcome the author of sin and death unless He took our nature on Him and made it His own, whom neither sin could pollute nor death retain.&#160; Doubtless then, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit within the womb of His Virgin Mother, who brought Him forth without the loss of her virginity, even as she conceived Him without its loss.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p18"></A>But if he could not draw a rightful understanding (of the matter) from this pure source of the Christian belief, because he had darkened the brightness of the clear truth by a veil of blindness peculiar to himself, he might have submitted himself to the teaching of the Gospels.&#160; And when Matthew speaks of &#8220;the Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_254"></A><A HREF="#fn_254"><FONT SIZE="1">255</FONT></A>
,&#8221; he might have also sought out the instruction afforded by the statements of the Apostles.&#160; And reading in the Epistle to the Romans, &#8220;Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called an Apostle, separated unto the Gospel of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p19.2"></A>God</span>, which He had promised before by His prophets in the Holy Scripture concerning His son, who was made unto Him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_255"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">256</FONT></A>
 of the seed of David after the flesh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">257</FONT></A>
,&#8221; he might have bestowed a loyal carefulness upon the pages of the prophets.&#160; And finding the promise of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p21.2"></A>God</span> who says to Abraham, &#8220;In thy seed shall all nations be blest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">258</FONT></A>
,&#8221; to avoid all doubt as to the reference of this seed, he might have followed the Apostle when He says, &#8220;To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed.&#160; He saith not and to seeds, as if in many, but as it in one, and to thy seed which is Christ&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">259</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; Isaiah&#146;s prophecy also he might have grasped by a closer attention to what he says, &#8220;Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son and they shall call His name Immanuel,&#8221; which is interpreted &#8220;<span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p23.2"></A>God</span> with us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">260</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; And the same prophet&#146;s words he might have read faithfully.&#160; &#8220;A child is born to us, a Son is given to us, whose power is upon His shoulder, and they shall call His name the Angel of the Great Counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p24.2"></A>God</span>, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the age to come&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">261</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; And then he would not speak so erroneously as to say that the Word became flesh in such a way that Christ, born of the Virgin&#146;s womb, had the form of man, but had not the reality of His mother&#146;s body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">262</FONT></A>
.&#160; Or is it possible that he thought our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p26.1"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ was not of our nature for this reason, that the angel, who was sent to the blessed Mary ever Virgin, says, &#8220;The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee:&#160; and therefore that Holy Thing also that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p26.2"></A>God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">263</FONT></A>
</span>,&#8221; on the supposition that as the conception of the Virgin was a Divine act, the flesh of the conceived did not partake of the conceiver&#146;s nature?&#160; But that birth so uniquely wondrous and so wondrously unique, is not to be understood in such wise that the properties of His kind were removed through the novelty of His creation.&#160; For though the Holy Spirit imparted fertility to the Virgin, yet a real body was received from her body; and, &#8220;Wisdom building her a house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">264</FONT></A>
,&#8221; &#8220;the Word became flesh and dwelt in us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">265</FONT></A>
,&#8221; that is, in that flesh which he took from man and which he quickened with the breath of a higher life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">266</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p31"></A>  <A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.xxviii-Page_40"></A>III.&#160; <i>The Faith and counsel of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p31.1"></A>God</span> in regard to the incarnation of the Word are set forth.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p32"></A>Without detriment therefore to the properties of either nature and substance which then came together in one person&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">267</FONT></A>
, majesty took on humility, strength weakness, eternity mortality:&#160; and for the paying off of the debt belonging to our condition inviolable nature was united with possible nature, so that, as suited the needs of our case&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">268</FONT></A>
, one and the same Mediator between <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p34.1"></A>God</span> and men, the Man Christ Jesus, could both die with the one and not die with the other.&#160; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">269</FONT></A>
Thus in the whole and perfect nature of true man was true <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p35.1"></A>God</span> born, complete in what was His own, complete in what was ours.&#160; And by &#8220;ours&#8221; we mean what the Creator formed in us from the beginning and what He undertook to repair.&#160; For what the Deceiver brought in and man deceived committed, had no trace in the Saviour.&#160; Nor, because He partook of man&#146;s weaknesses, did He therefore share our faults.&#160; He took the form of a slave&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">270</FONT></A>
 without stain of sin, increasing the human and not diminishing the divine:&#160; because that emptying of Himself whereby the Invisible made Himself visible and, Creator and <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p36.2"></A>Lord</span> of all things though He be, wished to be a mortal, was the bending down&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">271</FONT></A>
 of pity, not the failing of power.&#160; Accordingly He who while remaining in the form of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p37.1"></A>God</span> made man, was also made man in the form of a slave.&#160; For both natures retain their own proper character without loss:&#160; and as the form of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p37.2"></A>God</span> did not do away with the form of a slave, so the form of a slave did not impair the form of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p37.3"></A>God</span>.&#160; For inasmuch as the Devil used to boast that man had been cheated by his guile into losing the divine gifts, and bereft of the boon of immortality had undergone sentence of death, and that he had found some solace in his troubles from having a partner in delinquency&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">272</FONT></A>
, and that <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p38.1"></A>God</span> also at the demand of the principle of justice had changed His own purpose towards man whom He had created in such honour:&#160; there was need for the issue of a secret counsel, that the unchangeable <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p38.2"></A>God</span> whose will cannot be robbed of its own kindness, might carry out the first design of His Fatherly care&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">273</FONT></A>
 towards us by a more hidden mystery&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">274</FONT></A>
; and that man who had been driven into his fault by the treacherous cunning of the devil might not perish contrary to the purpose of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p40.2"></A>God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">275</FONT></A>
</span>.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p42"></A>IV.&#160; <i>The properties of the twofold nativity and nature of Christ are weighed one against another.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p43"></A>There enters then these lower parts of the world the Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p43.1"></A>God</span>, descending from His heavenly home and yet not quitting His Father&#146;s glory, begotten in a new order by a new nativity.&#160; In a new order, because being invisible in His own nature, He became visible in ours, and He whom nothing could contain was content to be contained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">276</FONT></A>
:&#160; abiding before all time He began to be in time:&#160; the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p48.1"></A>Lord</span> of all things, He obscured His immeasurable majesty and took on Him the form of a servant:&#160; being <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p48.2"></A>God</span> that cannot suffer, He did not disdain to be man that can, and, immortal as He is, to subject Himself to the laws of death.&#160; The <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p48.3"></A>Lord</span> assumed His mother&#146;s nature without her faultiness:&#160; nor in the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p48.4"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin&#146;s womb, does the wonderfulness of His birth make His nature unlike ours.&#160; For He who is true <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p48.5"></A>God</span> is also true man:&#160; and in this union there is no lie&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">277</FONT></A>
, since the humility of manhood and the loftiness of the Godhead both meet there.&#160; For as <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p49.1"></A>God</span> is not changed by the showing of pity, so man is not swallowed up by the dignity.&#160; For each form does what is proper to it with the co-operation of the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">278</FONT></A>
; that is the Word performing what appertains to the Word, and the flesh carrying out what appertains to the flesh.&#160; One of  <A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.xxviii-Page_41"></A>them sparkles with miracles, the other succumbs to injuries.&#160; And as the Word does not cease to be on an equality with His Father&#146;s glory, so the flesh does not forego the nature of our race.&#160; For it must again and again be repeated that one and the same is truly Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p50.1"></A>God</span> and truly son of man.&#160; <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p50.2"></A>God</span> in that &#8220;in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p50.3"></A>God</span>, and the Word was <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p50.4"></A>God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">279</FONT></A>
</span>;&#8221; man in that &#8220;the Word became flesh and dwelt in us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">280</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p52.2"></A>God</span> in that &#8220;all things were made by Him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">281</FONT></A>
, and without Him was nothing made:&#8221;&#160; man in that &#8220;He was made of a woman, made under law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">282</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; The nativity of the flesh was the manifestation of human nature:&#160; the childbearing of a virgin is the proof of Divine power.&#160; The infancy of a babe is shown in the humbleness of its cradle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">283</FONT></A>
:&#160; the greatness of the Most High is proclaimed by the angels&#146; voices&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">284</FONT></A>
.&#160; He whom Herod treacherously endeavours to destroy is like ourselves in our earliest stage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">285</FONT></A>
:&#160; but He whom the Magi delight to worship on their knees is the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p57.1"></A>Lord</span> of all.&#160; So too when He came to the baptism of John, His forerunner, lest He should not be known through the veil of flesh which covered His Divinity, the Father&#146;s voice thundering from the sky, said, &#8220;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">286</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; And thus Him whom the devil&#146;s craftiness attacks as man, the ministries of angels serve as <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p58.2"></A>God</span>.&#160; To be hungry and thirsty, to be weary, and to sleep, is clearly human:&#160; but to satisfy 5,000 men with five loaves, and to bestow on the woman of Samaria living water, droughts of which can secure the drinker from thirsting any more, to walk upon the surface of the sea with feet that do not sink, and to quell the risings of the waves by rebuking the winds, is, without any doubt, Divine.&#160; Just as therefore, to pass over many other instances, it is not part of the same nature to be moved to tears of pity for a dead friend, and when the stone that closed the four-days&#146; grave was removed, to raise that same friend to life with a voice of command:&#160; or, to hang on the cross, and turning day to night, to make all the elements tremble:&#160; or, to be pierced with nails, and yet open the gates of paradise to the robber&#146;s faith:&#160; so it is not part of the same nature to say, &#8220;I and the Father are one,&#8221; and to say, &#8220;the Father is greater than I&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">287</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; For although in the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p59.3"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p59.4"></A>God</span> and man is one person, yet the source of the degradation, which is shared by both, is one, and the source of the glory, which is shared by both, is another.&#160; For His manhood, which is less than the Father, comes from our side:&#160; His Godhead, which is equal to the Father, comes from the Father.</p>  
<p class="c27"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p60"></A>V.&#160; <i>Christ&#146;s flesh is proved real from Scripture.</i></p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p61"></A>Therefore in consequence of this unity of person which is to be understood in both natures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">288</FONT></A>
, we read of the Son of Man also descending from heaven, when the Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p62.3"></A>God</span> took flesh from the Virgin who bore Him.&#160; And again the Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p62.4"></A>God</span> is said to have been crucified and buried, although it was not actually in His Divinity whereby the Only-begotten is co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father, but in His weak human nature that He suffered these things.&#160; And so it is that in the Creed also we all confess that the Only-begotten Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p62.5"></A>God</span> was crucified and buried, according to that saying of the Apostle:&#160; &#8220;for if they had known, they would never have crucified the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p62.6"></A>Lord</span> of glory&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">289</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; But when our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p63.2"></A>Lord</span> and Saviour Himself would instruct His disciples&#146; faith by His questionings, He said, &#8220;Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?&#8221;&#160; And when they had put on record the various opinions of other people, He said, &#8220;But <i>ye</i>, whom do ye say that I am?&#8221;&#160; Me, that is, who am the Son of Man, and whom ye see in the form of a slave, and in true flesh, whom do ye say that I am?&#160; Whereupon blessed Peter, whose divinely inspired confession was destined to profit all nations, said, &#8220;Thou art Christ, the Son of the living <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p63.3"></A>God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">290</FONT></A>
</span>.&#8221;&#160; And not undeservedly was he pronounced blessed by the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p64.2"></A>Lord</span>, drawing from the chief corner-stone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_290"><FONT SIZE="1">291</FONT></A>
 the solidity of power which his name also expresses, he, who, through the revelation of the Father, confessed Him to be at once Christ  <A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.xxviii-Page_42"></A>and Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.4"></A>God</span>:&#160; because the receiving of the one of these without the other was of no avail to salvation, and it was equally perilous to have believed the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.5"></A>Lord</span> Jesus Christ to be either only <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.6"></A>God</span> without man, or only man without <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.7"></A>God</span>.&#160; But after the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p65.8"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> resurrection (which, of course, was of His true body, because He was raised the same as He had died and been buried), what else was effected by the forty days&#146; delay than the cleansing of our faith&#146;s purity from all darkness?&#160; For to that end He talked with His disciples, and dwelt and ate with them, He allowed Himself to be handled with diligent and curious touch by those who were affected by doubt, He entered when the doors were shut upon the Apostles, and by His breathing upon them gave them the Holy Spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_291"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">292</FONT></A>
, and bestowing on them the light of understanding, opened the secrets of the Holy Scriptures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">293</FONT></A>
.&#160; So again He showed the wound in His side, the marks of the nails, and all the signs of His quite recent suffering, saying, &#8220;See My hands and feet, that it is I.&#160; Handle Me and see that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">294</FONT></A>
;&#8221; in order that the properties of His Divine and human nature might be acknowledged to remain still inseparable:&#160; and that we might know the Word not to be different from the flesh, in such a sense as also to confess that the one Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p68.2"></A>God</span> is both the Word and flesh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">295</FONT></A>
.&#160; Of this mystery of the faith&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">296</FONT></A>
 your opponent Eutyches must be reckoned to have but little sense if he has recognized our nature in the Only-begotten of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p70.1"></A>God</span> neither through the humiliation of His having to die, nor through the glory of His rising again.&#160; Nor has he any fear of the blessed apostle and evangelist John&#146;s declaration when he says, &#8220;every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh, is of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p70.2"></A>God</span>:&#160; and every spirit which destroys Jesus is not of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p70.3"></A>God</span>, and this is Antichrist&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_296"><FONT SIZE="1">297</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; But what is &#8220;to destroy Jesus,&#8221; except to take away the human nature from Him, and to render void the mystery, by which alone we were saved, by the most barefaced fictions.&#160; The truth is that being in darkness about the nature of Christ&#146;s body, he must also be befooled by the same blindness in the matter of His sufferings.&#160; For if he does not think the cross of the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p71.5"></A>Lord</span> fictitious, and does not doubt that the punishment He underwent to save the world is likewise true, let him acknowledge the flesh of Him whose death he already believes:&#160; and let him not disbelieve Him man with a body like ours, since he acknowledges Him to have been able to suffer:&#160; seeing that the denial of His true flesh is also the denial of His bodily suffering.&#160; If therefore he receives the Christian faith, and does not turn away his ears from the preaching of the Gospel:&#160; let him see what was the nature that hung pierced with nails on the wooden cross, and, when the side of the Crucified was opened by the soldier&#146;s spear, let him understand whence it was that blood and water flowed, that the Church of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p71.6"></A>God</span> might be watered from the font and from the cup&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">298</FONT></A>
.&#160; Let him hear also the blessed Apostle Peter, proclaiming that the sanctification of the Spirit takes place through the sprinkling of Christ&#146;s blood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_298"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">299</FONT></A>
.&#160; And let him not read cursorily the same Apostle&#146;s words when he says, &#8220;Knowing that not with corruptible things, such as silver and gold, have ye been redeemed from your vain manner of life which is part of your fathers&#146; tradition, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a lamb without spot and blemish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_299"></A><A HREF="#fn_299"><FONT SIZE="1">300</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; Let him not resist too the witness of the blessed Apostle John, who says:&#160; &#8220;and the blood of Jesus the Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p74.2"></A>God</span> cleanseth us from all sin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_300"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">301</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; And again:&#160; &#8220;this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.&#8221;&#160; And &#8220;who is He that overcometh the world save He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p75.2"></A>God</span>.&#160; This is He that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ:&#160; not by water only, but by water and blood.&#160; And it is the Spirit that testifieth, because the Spirit is the truth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_301"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">302</FONT></A>
, because there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the water and the blood, and the three are one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">303</FONT></A>
.&#8221;&#160; The Spirit, that is, of sanctification, and the blood of redemption, and the water of baptism:&#160; because the three are one, and remain undivided, and none of them is separated from this connection; because the catholic Church lives and progresses by this faith, so that in Christ Jesus neither the manhood without the true Godhead nor  <A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.xxviii-Page_43"></A>the Godhead without the true manhood is believed in.</p>

,&#8221; I am surprised that so absurd and mistaken a statement of his should not have been criticised and rebuked by his judges, and that an utterance which reaches the height of stupidity and blasphemy should be allowed to pass as if nothing offensive had been heard:&#160; for the impiety of saying that the Son of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p80.1"></A>God</span> was of two natures before His incarnation is only equalled by the iniquity of asserting that there was but one nature in Him after &#8220;the Word became flesh.&#8221;&#160; And to the end that Eutyches may not think this a right or defensible opinion because it was not contradicted by any expression of yourselves, we warn you beloved brother, to take anxious care that if ever through the inspiration of <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p80.2"></A>God&#146;s</span> mercy the case is brought to a satisfactory conclusion, his ignorant mind be purged from this pernicious idea as well as others.&#160; He was, indeed, just beginning to beat a retreat from his erroneous conviction, as the order of proceedings shows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">305</FONT></A>
, in so far as when hemmed in by your remonstrances he agreed to say what he had not said before and to acquiesce in that belief to which before he had been opposed.&#160; However, when he refused to give his consent to the anathematizing of his blasphemous dogma, you understood, brother&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">306</FONT></A>
, that he abode by his treachery and deserved to receive a verdict of condemnation.&#160; And yet, if he grieves over it faithfully and to good purpose, and, late though it be, acknowledges how rightly the bishops&#146; authority has been set in motion; or if with his own mouth and hand in your presence he recants his wrong opinions, no mercy that is shown to him when penitent can be found fault with&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">307</FONT></A>
:&#160; because our <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.xxviii-p83.1"></A>Lord</span>, that true and &#8220;good shepherd&#8221; who laid down His life for His sheep&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">308</FONT></A>
 and who came to save not lose men&#146;s souls&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">309</FONT></A>

; in order that while justice constrains us when we sin, mercy may prevent our rejection when we have returned.&#160; For then at last is the true Faith most profitably defended when a false belief is condemned even by the supporters of it.</p>
