<p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p4"></A>Your most sweet Charity has said much to me in your letters in praise of my good deeds, to all which I briefly reply, <i>Call me not Noemi, that is beautiful; but call me Mara, that is bitter; for I am full of bitterness</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rut001.htm#020">Ruth i. 20</a><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p4.1"></A>).</p>

, which is pending with my brother and fellow-bishop, the most reverend Patriarch John, we have, as I think, for our adversary the very man whom you assert to be desirous of observing the canons.&#160; Further, I declare to thy Charity that I am prepared, with the help of Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p6.1"></A>God</span>, to prosecute this same cause with all my power and influence.&#160; And, should I see that in it the canons of the Apostolic See are not observed, Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p6.2"></A>God</span> will give unto me what I may do against the contemners of the same.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p7"></A>As to what your Charity has written to me, asking me to give thanks for you to my son the chief physician and ex-pr&aelig;fect Theodorus, I have done so, and have by no means ceased to commend you as much as I could.&#160; Further, I beg you to pardon me for replying to your letters with brevity; for I am pressed by such great tribulations that it is not allowed me either to read or to speak much by letter.&#160; This only I say to thee, <i>For the voice of groaning I have forgotten to eat my bread</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#004">Psa. 102.4</a><a name="iii.v.iv.xxiv-p7.1"></A>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1555"></A><A HREF="#fn_1555"><FONT SIZE="1">1556</FONT></A>
).&#160; All that are with you I beg you to salute in my name.&#160; Give my salutations to the lady Dominica, whose letter I have not answered, because, though she is Latin, she wrote to me in Greek.</p>
