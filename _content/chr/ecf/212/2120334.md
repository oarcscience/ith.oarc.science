<span id="iii.v.i.xxxii-p2"></span>To Peter the Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxii-p3"></span>Gregory to Peter, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxii-p4"></span>The divine precepts admonish us to
love our neighbours as ourselves; and, seeing that we are enjoined to
love them with this charity, how much more ought we to succour them by
supplies to their carnal needs, that we may relieve their distress, if
not in all respects, yet at least with some support.  Inasmuch, then, as
we have found that the son of the most worthy Godiscalchus is in
distress, not only from loss of sight, but also from want of food, we
hold it necessary to provide for him as far as possible.  Wherefore we
enjoin thy Experience by this present order to supply to him for
sustaining life twenty-four *modii* of wheat every year, and also twelve
*modii* of beans and twenty *decimates* <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[1366](#fn_1365) of wine; which may afterwards be
debited in thy accounts.  So act, therefore, that the bearer of these
presents may have to complain of no delay in receiving the gifts of the
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xxxii-p5.1"></span>Lord</span>, and
that thou mayest be found partaker in the well administered benefit.
