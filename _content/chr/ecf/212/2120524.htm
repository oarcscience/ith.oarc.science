<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p5"></A>We have learnt from the servant of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p5.1"></A>God</span>, Augustine, the bearer of these presents, how great goodness, how great gentleness, with the charity that is well-pleasing to Christ, is in you resplendent; and we give thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p5.2"></A>God</span>, who has granted you these gifts of His loving-kindness, through which you may have it in your power to be highly esteemed among men, and&#8212;what is truly profitable&#8212;glorious in His sight.&#160; We therefore pray Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p5.3"></A>God</span>, that He would multiply in you these gifts which He has granted, and keep you with all yours under His protection, and so dispose the doings of your Glory in this world that they may be to your benefit both here, and&#8212;what is more to be wished&#8212;in the life to come.&#160; Saluting, then, your Glory with paternal sweetness, we beg of you that the bearer of these presents, and the servants of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p5.4"></A>God</span> who are with him, may obtain your succour in what is needful, to the end that, while they experience your favour, they may the better fulfil what has been enjoined on them to do.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p6"></A>Furthermore, we commend to you in all respects our son the presbyter Candidus, whom we have sent for the government of the patrimony of our Church which is in your parts; trusting that your Glory will receive a reward in return from our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxviii-p6.1"></A>God</span>, if with devout mind you lend your succour to the concerns of the poor.</p>
