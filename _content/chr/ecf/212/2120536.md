<span id="iii.v.vii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vii.iv-p1.1"></span>Epistle VI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.iv-p2"></span>To Mauricius Augustus.

<span id="iii.v.vii.iv-p3"></span>Gregory to Mauricius Augustus.

<span id="iii.v.vii.iv-p4"></span>Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.iv-p4.1"></span>God</span>, who has made your Piety to be
the guardian of ecclesiastical peace, preserves you by the same faith
which, through unity among priests, you preserve; and when you submit
your heart humbly to the yoke of heavenly loving-kindness, it is brought
to pass by heavenly grace that you tread your enemies under the foot of
valour.  For it cannot be of small advantage that, when John of holy
memory had departed this life, your Piety long hesitated, and somewhat
deferred the time, while seeking counsel in the fear of Almighty <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.iv-p4.2"></span>God</span>, in order, to
wit, that the cause of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.iv-p4.3"></span>God</span> might be ordered, as it should
be, with great fear <span id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686) .  Whence
also I think that my brother and fellow-priest Cyriacus is proved to be
exceedingly fit for pastoral rule, in that the long deliberation of your
Piety has raised him to this degree.  And we all know how diligent and
how practised he has long been in the administration of ecclesiastical
affairs.  Whence also I doubt not that it has been brought about by
Divine ordering that one who had administered <span id="page_214b">p.
214b</span> <span id="iii.v.vii.iv-Page_214b"></span>the least things
well should fitly undertake the greater, and should pass from the charge
of affairs to the government of souls.  Wherefore in all our prayers we
beseech Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.iv-p5.1"></span>God</span> to repay this good work to the
Serenity of our lords and to their pious offspring both in the present
world and also with a perpetual recompense, and to grant to my aforesaid
brother and fellow-priest, who has been put over the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.iv-p5.2"></span>Lord’s</span> flock, to
shew himself fully solicitous in the care of souls; that he may be able
irreprovably both to correct what is wrong in his subjects and to foster
what is right unto further increase; to the end that the judgment of
your Piety concerning him may be approved, not only before men, but also
before the eyes of the Supernal Majesty.

<span id="iii.v.vii.iv-p6"></span>The venerable men, George the
presbyter and Theodore the deacon, in consideration of the command of my
lords and the imminence of the winter season, I have not allowed to be
delayed in this city.

appointment of the Patriarchs of Constantinople rested in fact entirely
with the Emperor.
