<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxi-p4"></A>The tenor of your letters, which evinces a religious spirit and the earnestness of a pious mind, causes us not only to commend the purpose of your request, but also to grant willingly what you demand.&#160; For indeed it would ill become us to refuse what Christian devotion and the desire of an upright heart solicits, especially as we know that you demand, and embrace with your whole heart, what may both protect the faith of believers, and work no less the salvation of souls.&#160; Accordingly, greeting your Excellency with befitting honour, we inform you that to Leuparic, the bearer of these presents, through whom we received your communication, and whom you described as a presbyter, we have handed over, according to your Excellency&#146;s request, with the reverence due to them, certain relics of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul.&#160; But, that laudable and religious devotion may be more and more conspicuous among you, you must see that these benefits of the saints be deposited with reverence and due honour, and that those who serve in attendance on them be vexed with no burdens or molestations, lest perchance, under the pressure of outward necessity, they be rendered unprofitable and slow in the service of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxi-p4.1"></A>God</span>, and (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxi-p4.2"></A>God</span> forbid) the benefits of the saints that have been bestowed sustain injury and neglect.&#160; Let, then, your Excellency see to their quiet, to the end that, while they are guarded by your bounty from all disquietude, they may render praises to our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxi-p4.3"></A>God</span> with minds undisturbed, and that reward may also accrue to you in the life eternal.</p>
