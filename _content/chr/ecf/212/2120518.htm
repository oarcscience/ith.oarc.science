<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxii-p3"></A> This, with the eight following letters (51&#8211;59), were committed to Augustine, who is spoken of in several of them as the bearer, when he was sent back from Rome to rejoin his companions.&#160; Bede (<i>H. E</i>. I. 23), and John the deacon (<i>Vit. S. Greg</i>. II. 33), say that the missionaries&#8212;&#8220;cum aliquantulum itinerus confecissent&#8221; (Bede)&#8212;&#8220;post dies aliquot&#8221; (John Diac.)&#8212;were deterred by what they had heard of the difficulties of their undertaking, and sent Augustine to Rome to request leave to give it up and that Gregory sent him back to them with letters of admonition and of commendation.&#160; No commendatory letters seem to have been given them when they first set out.&#160; Those now sent are addressed to the bishops of Turni (<i>al. Turon</i>), Marseilles, Arles, Vienne, Autun, and Aix in Provenee, to the abbot of Lerins, to Arigius, Patrician of Gaul, to Theodoric and Theodebert, the two boy-kings of Burgundy and Austrasia, and to queen Brunechild their grandmother, who at this time ruled Austrasia as Theodebert&#146;s guardian.&#160; See <i>Pedigree of Kings of Gaul</i>, p. xxx.&#160; The letters which come first in order, 51 and 52, being dated 22 July <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxii-p3.1"></A>a.d.</span> 596, we may conclude that the missionaries had been originally despatched in the spring of the same year.&#160; They appear to have got as far as the southern coast of Provence, since the letters to the bishop of Aix and the Abbot of Lerins shew that Augustine had already visited them, though not, apparently, any others to whom letters are now addressed.&#160; The mission was accompanied by Candidus, sent out as <i>Rector</i> of the patrimony in Gaul (cf. Ep. VII.), who is also commended in the letter.&#160; The patrimony appears to have been attended to previously in a way not satisfactory to Gregory by the bishops of Arles (see below, Epp. LIII., LV.).&#160; This letter is not found in the <i>Registrum Epistolorum</i>; but given by Bede (I. 23), and by John the Deacon (<i>Vit. S. Greg</i>. lib. ii. c. 34).</p>
