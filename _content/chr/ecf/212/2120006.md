<span id="ii.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Manuscripts.</span>

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p2"></span>I.  At the *Vatican*.  (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>α</span>) *Of the
Sermons*.  (1)  Codd. 3835 and 6 are two volumes in Roman Character of a
Lectionary of about the 8th century; the second volume contains the
“Tome” (which in the 8th and 9th centuries used to be read in the Church
offices before Christmas):  (2)  3828, a parchment (10th century), also
a lectionary:  (3)  1195, a parchment folio (11th century), a lectionary
containing *inter alia* some of Leo’s homilies:  (4)  1267, 8 and 9 of
the same character (11th century):  (5)  1270 contains the Sermon *de
Festo Petri cathedræ*, (now xiv. in Migne’s Appendix), from which
Cacciari restored Quesnel’s imperfect edition of it to its present
state:  (6)  1271 and 2 are also lectionaries:  (7)  4222 in Lombardic
characters (9th century), a lectionary:  (8)  5451 in Roman characters
(12th century), a lectionary:  (9)  6450 parchment (12th century):  a
lectionary containing the sermon *de Festo Petri cathedræ* in the form
found and printed by Quesnel; (10)  6451 similar:  it contains sermons
*de Quadragesima*  and others:  (11)  6454 similar.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p3"></span>(<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p3.1"></span>β</span>) Of the *Letters*:  these are mostly
rather later (i.e. about 12th or 13th century):  but (1)  1322 is of an
older date, and contains besides the epistles, all the acts of the
Council of Chalcedon:  (2)  5759 is earlier than the 9th century; it
used to belong to the monastery of S. Columban at Bobbio, and contains
31 letters:  (3)  5845 is very ancient, and according to Cacciari,
Lombardic:  it contains 24 letters.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p4"></span>(<span class="Greek"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p4.1"></span>γ</span>) *Letters and Sermons together*:  of
these there are nine collections in the Vatican, of which 548 and 9
contain the sermon *de Absalom*  which is condemned by Cacciari.  The
*Regio-Vaticanus codex* 139 is a fine collection of Leo’s works (12th
century).

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p5"></span>II.  *At other places*:  (1)  The codex
*Urbinas* 65 is thought to be a copy of the Regio-Vaticanus 139 made in
the 14th century.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p6"></span>(2)  Codex *Grimanicus* <span
id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13) is a <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p7.1"></span>ms.</span> on which Quesnel lays great
stress:  Quesnel assigns it to the ninth century; it contains 107
letters, of which 28 had never been printed before Quesnel.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p8"></span>(3)  The *Thuanei*; (<span
class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p8.1"></span>α</span>) 129 contains

class="Greek"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p8.3"></span>γ</span>) 729 contains
the spurious *de vocatione gentium* and some epistles.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p9"></span>(4)  The *Corbeienses* are old.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p10"></span>(5)  The *Taurinensis* 29 D. iv. is a
fine 13th-century <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p10.1"></span>ms.</span> containing 52 letters.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p11"></span>(6)  The *Florentinus codex* belongs to
the 13th century also.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p12"></span>(7)  *Ratisbonensis* 113 DD. AA., in the
monastery of S. Emeramus, contains 72 letters:  it is said to date from
about 750 <span class="sc"><span id="ii.iii.ii-p12.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p13"></span>(8)  The two *Bergonenses* are of 12th
century, and contain 12 sermons.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p14"></span> <span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span> <span
id="ii.iii.ii-Page_xiv"></span>(9)  Two *Chigiani* also of 12th century
contain 4 sermons.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p15"></span>(10)  The *Padilironenses* contain 9
sermons and the Tome.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p16"></span>(11)  There are three *Patavini*, of
which two contain the Tome.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p17"></span>(12)  *Vallicellani*:  these are a
number of 11th or 12th-century codices.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p18"></span>There are also the *Veneti*, the
*Vercellenses*, the *Veronenses*, &c.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p19"></span>N.B.  The foregoing account is taken
from Schönemann’s *Notitia Historico-Literaria*  (1794), and the
translator has no means of knowing whether it is still correct (1890).
