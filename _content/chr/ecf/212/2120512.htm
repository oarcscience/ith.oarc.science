<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxvi-p5"></A>Your communication to us has found us much distressed from having become aware that offence has arisen between you and John our brother and fellow-bishop, in whose agreement with you we were desirous of rejoicing.&#160; For, whatever the cause may have been, rage ought not to have broken out to such a pitch that your armed men, as we have heard, should have burst into the episcopal palace, and committed divers evil deeds in a hostile manner, and that this affair should meanwhile separate you from his paternal charity.&#160; Could not the dispute, whatever it may have been, have been quietly arranged, so that neither party might suffer disadvantage, nor good feeling be disturbed?&#160; Now it is not unknown to us of what gravity, of what holiness, of what gentleness our above-named brother is.&#160; Whence we gather that, unless excessive force of vexation had compelled him, his Fraternity would by no means have resorted to the measure by which you say that you are aggrieved.&#160; We, however, on hearing of it by letter from him, at once wrote to him, admonishing him to receive your offerings as before, and not only to allow masses to be celebrated in your house, but, if you wish it, even to officiate himself, and that he ought to have prosecuted his cause without breach of charity.&#160; And, inasmuch as we wish none to come or continue to be at variance, we have taken care to renew this same admonition.&#160; Hence it is necessary, dearest son, that you, as becomes sons, should shew him the reverence due to a priest, and not provoke his spirit to anger.&#160; For with whom will you have assured goodwill, if (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxvi-p5.1"></A>God</span> forbid) you are at variance with your priest?&#160; Wherefore, putting away swelling of spirit, try ye so to transact the causes that ye have one with another that both charity may remain inviolate, and what is to your mutual advantage may be peaceably attained.</p>
