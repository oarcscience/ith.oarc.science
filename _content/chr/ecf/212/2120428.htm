<p><a name="iii.v.iv.vii-p4"></A>We are well assured that the mind of your religious Excellency is inflamed with zeal of divine love against those things especially which are done in unseemly wise in the churches.&#160; We therefore the more gladly impose on you the correction of faults in ecclesiastical cases as we have confidence in the bent of your pious disposition.&#160; Be it known, then, to your Excellence that it has been reported to us by some who have come to us   <A NAME="page_147b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iv.vii-Page_147b"></A>from the African parts that many things are being committed in the council of Numidia contrary to the way of the Fathers and the ordinances of the canons.&#160; And, being unable to bear any longer the frequent complaints that have reached us about such things, we committed them to be enquired into to our brother and fellow-bishop Columbus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1528"></A><A HREF="#fn_1528"><FONT SIZE="1">1529</FONT></A>
, of whose gravity his very reputation, which is spread abroad, now allows us not to doubt.&#160; Wherefore, greeting you with fatherly affection, we exhort your Excellence that in all things pertaining to ecclesiastical discipline you should lend him the support of your assistance, lest, if what is done amiss should not be enquired into and visited, it should grow with greater license into future excesses through precedent of long continuance.&#160; Know moreover, most excellent son, that if you seek victories, and are dealing for the security of the province committed to you, nothing will avail you more for this end than being zealous in restraining as far as possible the lives of priests and the intestine wars of Churches.</p>
