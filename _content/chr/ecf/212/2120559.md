<span id="iii.v.vii.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XLII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.vii.xxvii-p2"></span>To Marinianus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xxvii-p3"></span>Gregory to Marinianus, Bishop of
Ravenna.

<span id="iii.v.vii.xxvii-p4"></span>We find from the information given
in your Fraternity’s letter that the sons of the Church of Cornelium are
continually supplicating you to consecrate a bishop for them in place of
their former bishop who has lapsed, and that you are in doubt as to what
should be done in the matter, and await our plain command.  Inasmuch,
then, as no sort of reason allows any one who has departed criminally to
be recalled to the place from which he has lapsed, and as the ordinances
of the sacred canons allow not a Church to be without a bishop beyond
three months, lest (which <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xxvii-p4.1"></span>God</span> forbid) the ancient foe
should lie in wait to tear the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vii.xxvii-p4.2"></span>Lord’s</span> flock, your Fraternity
ought to comply with their entreaty, and ordain a bishop in the place of
the lapsed one.  For, seeing that you ought to have admonished them to
this thing by your exhortations before they asked you, you can have no
excuse for refusing them when they demand it of you, since a Church of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.vii.xxvii-p4.3"></span>God</span> ought
not to remain long widowed of a bishop of its own.
