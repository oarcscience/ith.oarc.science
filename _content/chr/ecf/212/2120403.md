id="iii.v.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xvii-p2"></span>To Dynamius, Patrician.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xvii-p3"></span>Gregory to Dynamius, Patrician of
Gaul.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xvii-p4"></span>He who administers faithfully what
is other’s shews how well he dispenses what is his own.  And this your
Glory makes manifest to us in that, intent on your annual offering, you
have rendered the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, the fruits of
his revenues.  In paying him what is his faithfully, you have made these
gifts to him your own.  For indeed it becomes the glorious people of
this earth who think of eternal glory so to act that in virtue of their
excelling in temporal power, they may procure for themselves a reward
that is not temporal.  Accordingly, addressing to you the greeting which
we owe, we implore Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xvii-p4.1"></span>God</span> both to replenish your life
with present good, and to extend it to the lofty joys of eternity.  For
we have received through our son Hilarus (*al* Hilarius) of the
aforesaid revenues of our Church four hundred Gallican *solidi* <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1488](#fn_1487) .  We now send you as the
benediction of the blessed apostle Peter a small cross, wherein are
inserted benefits from his chains <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[1489](#fn_1488) , which for a time bound his neck: 
but may <span id="page_131b">p. 131b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iii.xvii-Page_131b"></span>they loose yours from sins for
ever.  Moreover in its four parts round about are contained benefits
from the gridiron of the blessed Laurence, whereon he was burnt, that
it, whereon his body was consumed by fire for the truth’s sake, may
inflame your soul to the love of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.iii.xvii-p6.1"></span>Lord</span>.
