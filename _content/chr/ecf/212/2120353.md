<span id="iii.v.i.li-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.li-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXXIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.li-p2"></span>To Martinus, Bishop in Corsica.

<span id="iii.v.i.li-p3"></span>Gregory to Martinus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.li-p4"></span>To those who ask for what is just it
behoves us to lend a kindly ear, to the end both that the petitioners
may find the remedies they hope for, and that the anxious care of a
shepherd be not wanting to the Church.  And inasmuch as the church of
Tanates, in which thy Fraternity was formerly adorned with sacerdotal
dignity, has for its sins been so taken possession of and ruined by
hostile savagery that no further hope remains of thy returning thither,
we appoint thee, by authority of these presents, undisputed cardinal
priest <span id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391) in the Church of
Saona, which has now been long deprived of the aid of a pontiff.  Do
thou therefore so arrange and order all things according to the
injunctions of the canons with vigilant care in the love of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.li-p5.1"></span>God</span>, that both thy
Fraternity may rejoice in having attained thy desires, and the Church of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.li-p5.2"></span>God</span> may be
filled with answering joy for having received thee as Cardinal pontiff.

<span id="iii.v.i.li-p5"></span> Cardinal bishops, presbyters, or
deacons, meant formerly such as were regularly instituted and attached
to some particular see, parish, or church, which constituted their title
(*titulas*).  They were then said to be *incardinati*, the act of so
instituting them being called *incardinatio*.  Cf. II. 37; XIV. 7.
