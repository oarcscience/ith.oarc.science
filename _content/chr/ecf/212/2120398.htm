<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.iii.xii-p2"></A>To Antoninus, Subdeacon.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iii.xii-p3"></A>Gregory to Antoninus, Subdeacon, Rector of the patrimony in Dalmatia.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iii.xii-p4"></A>It is commonly reported in these parts that our brother and fellow-bishop, Natalis of the Church of Salona, is dead.&#160; If this is true, let thy Experience with all speed and all care hasten to admonish the clergy and people of that city that with one consent they elect a priest for ordination; and, when the nomination of the person who may be elected has been made, thou wilt take care to transmit it to us, that he may be ordained with our consent, as has been the case from ancient times.&#160; And this above all things thou must look to, that in this election neither any bribery in any way whatever come in, nor the patronage of any persons whatever prevail.&#160; For if one is elected through the patronage of certain persons, he is obliged out of deference to them to comply with their wishes after his ordination, and so it comes to pass that the possessions of that church are lessened, and ecclesiastical order is not maintained.&#160; They must, therefore, under thy superintendence, elect such a person as will not be unsuitably subservient to the will of any one, but one who in the adornment of his life and conversation may be found worthy of such a high degree.&#160; But of the possessions or ornaments of the same church cause an inventory to be faithfully written out in thy presence.&#160; And, lest any of the possessions themselves should be lost, admonish Respectus the deacon and Stephanus the chief notary (<i>primicerium notariarum</i>) to take sole charge of these possessions, warning them that they will have to make good out of their own substance any diminution of them that may have arisen from their negligence.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iii.xii-p5"></A>Moreover, strictly charge Malchus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1482"></A><A HREF="#fn_1482"><FONT SIZE="1">1483</FONT></A>
, our brother and fellow-bishop, that he refrain entirely from intermeddling in this matter.&#160; For, should we learn that anything has been done or attempted by him against our will, let him know that he will incur no slight guilt and danger.&#160; But of this also take care to warn him, that he must be careful to set down and complete the accounts of our patrimony which he has had in charge; for doing which let him make haste, laying aside all excuses, to come to us from the Sicilian parts.&#160; Let him, then, in no wise presume to meddle with the affairs of the Church of Salona, lest he should be under further liability to it, and possibly found culpable.&#160; For he is said to have many things belonging to the aforesaid church; and report goes that he was well-nigh the prime mover in the sale of its possessions, and in other unlawful doings. &#160;And, should this be found in manifest truth to be as it is said to be, he may be certain that it will by no means remain unavenged.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iii.xii-p7"></A>Let any necessary expenses be defrayed by the steward who was in office at the time of the aforesaid bishop&#146;s death, that so he may explain his accounts to the future bishop as he knows them to be.&#160; All the things that we have enjoined on thee to be done it is certainly necessary that thou shouldest do with the advice of our son, the magnificent and most eloquent Marcellus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1483"></A><A HREF="#fn_1483"><FONT SIZE="1">1484</FONT></A>
, to the end that thou mayest be able to carry out carefully and effectively all that is contained in this paper of directions, and that no blame for negligence may belong to thee</p>

IX. 5.</p>
