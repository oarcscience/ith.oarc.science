id="iii.v.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Epistle XII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.x-p2"></span>To Maximianus, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.iii.x-p3"></span>Gregory to Maximianus, bishop of
Syracuse

<span id="iii.v.iii.x-p4"></span>I wrote some time ago to your
Fraternity desiring you to send to the Roman city those who had alleged
anything against Gregory, bishop of the city of Agrigentum <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480) .  And we exhort you by this
present epistle that this should be immediately done.  Wherefore hasten
to send with speed the persons themselves, and the rest of the
documents, that is the reports of proceedings and the petitions that
have been given in.  Nor do we allow any delay or excuse to be sought;
to the end that, when they have been sent, as we have said, with speed
to the Roman city, we may know how, with the help of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.iii.x-p5.1"></span>God</span>, we may most
advantageously deal with him.
