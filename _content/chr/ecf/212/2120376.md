<span id="iii.v.ii.xxi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xxi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxi-p2"></span>To John, Bishop of Squillacium
(Squillace, in Calabria).

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxi-p3"></span>Gregory to John, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xxi-p4"></span>The care of our pastoral office warns
us to appoint for bereaved churches bishops of their own, who may govern
the <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.xxi-p4.1"></span>Lord’s</span>
flock with pastoral solicitude.  Accordingly we have held it necessary
to appoint thee, John, bishop of the *civitas Lissitana* (*Lissus*,
hodie, *Alessio?*), which has been captured by the enemy, to be
cardinal <span id="fr_1439"></span>[1440](#fn_1439) in the Church of
Squillacium, that thou mayest carry on the cure of souls once undertaken
by thee, having regard to future retribution.  And although, being
driven from thine own Church by the invading enemy, thou must govern
another Church which is now without a shepherd, yet it must be on
condition that, in case of the former city being set free from the
enemy, and under the protection of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xxi-p5.1"></span>God</span> restored to its former state,
thou return to the Church in which thou wast first ordained.  If,
however, the aforesaid city continues to suffer under the calamity of
captivity, thou must remain in this Church wherein thou art by us
incardinated <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1441](#fn_1440) .  Moreover, we
enjoin thee never to make unlawful ordinations, or allow any bigamist,
or one who has taken a wife who was not a virgin, or one ignorant of
letters, or one maimed in any part of his body, or a penitent, or one
liable to any condition of service, to attain to sacred orders.  And,
shouldest thou find any of this kind, thou must not dare to advance
them.  Africans generally, and unknown strangers, applying for
ecclesiastical orders, on no account accept seeing that some Africans
are Manichæans, and some have been rebaptized; while many strangers,
though being in minor orders, are proved to have pretended to a higher
dignity.  We also admonish thy Fraternity to watch wisely over the souls
committed to thee, and to be more intent on winning souls than on the
profits of the present life.  Be diligent in keeping and disposing of
the goods of the Church, that the coming Judge, when He comes to judge,
may approve thee as having in all respects worthily executed the office
of shepherd which thou hast taken upon thee.
