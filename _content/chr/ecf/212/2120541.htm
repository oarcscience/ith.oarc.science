<p> <a name="iii.v.vii.ix"></A>
<p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p1.1"></A>Epistle XV.</span></p>  
<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p2"></A>To George, Presbyter.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p3"></A>Gregory to George, Presbyter, and to Theodore, deacon, of the Church of Constantinople.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p4"></A>Mindful of your goodness and charity, I greatly blame myself, that I gave you leave to return so soon:&#160; but, since I saw you pressing me importunately once and again for leave to go, I considered that it might be a serious matter for your Love to tarry with us longer.&#160; But, after I had learnt that you had lingered so long on your journey owing to the winter season, I confess that I was sorry that you had been sent away so soon.&#160; For, if your Love was unable to accomplish your intended journey, it had been better that you had lingered with me than away from me.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5"></A>Moreover, after your departure I learnt from information given me by my most beloved sons the deacons that your Love had said that our Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.1"></A>Lord</span> and Saviour Jesus Christ, when He descended into hell, saved all who there acknowledged Him as <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.2"></A>God</span>, and delivered them from the pains due to them.&#160; With regard to this subject I desire that your Charity should think very differently.&#160; For, when He descended into hell, He delivered through His grace those only who both believed that He should come and observed His precepts in their lives.&#160; For it is evident that after the incarnation of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.3"></A>Lord</span> no one can be saved, even of those who hold His faith, who have not the life of faith; since it is written, <i>They acknowledge that they know <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.4"></A>God</span>, but in deeds they deny Him</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#016">Tit. i. 16</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.5"></A>).&#160; And John says, <i>He that saith that he knows Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#004">1 John ii. 4</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.6"></A>).&#160; James also, the brother of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.7"></A>Lord</span>, writes saying, <i>Faith without works is dead</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020">Jam. ii. 20</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.8"></A>).&#160; If, then, believers now are not saved without good works, while the unbelieving and reprobate without good action were saved by our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.9"></A>Lord</span> descending into hell, then the lot of those who never saw the incarnation of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.10"></A>Lord</span> was better than that of these who have been born after the mystery of His incarnation.&#160; But what fatuity it argues to say or think this the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.11"></A>Lord</span> Himself testifies to His disciples, when He says, <i>Many kings and prophets have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen them</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#017">Matt. 13:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024">Luke 10:24</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.12"></A>).&#160; But, that I may not   <A NAME="page_217b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 217b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.vii.ix-Page_217b"></A>detain your Love with argument of my own, learn what Philaster, in the book which he wrote about heresies, says about this heresy.&#160; His words are these; &#8220;They are heretics who say that the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.13"></A>Lord</span> descended into hell, and announced himself after death to all who were already there, so that in acknowledging Him there they might be saved; seeing that this is contrary to the prophet David where he says, <i>But in hell who shall acknowledge thee</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#006">Ps. vi. 6</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.14"></A>)?&#160; And to the Apostle; <i>As many as have sinned without law shall perish without law</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012">Rom. ii. 12</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p5.15"></A>).&#8221;&#160; And with his words the blessed Augustine also agrees in the book which he wrote about heresies.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6"></A>Considering, therefore, all these things, hold ye nothing but what the true faith teaches through the Catholic Church: namely, that the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.1"></A>Lord</span> in descending into hell rescued from infernal durance those only whom while living in the flesh He preserved through His grace in faith and good conduct.&#160; For in that which He says in the Gospel, <i>When I shall be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all to myself</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#032">John xii. 32</a><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.2"></A>), He means all that are elect.&#160; For one could not be drawn to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.3"></A>God</span> after death who had separated himself from <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.4"></A>God</span> by evil living.&#160; May Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.ix-p6.5"></A>God</span> keep you under His protection, that, wherever ye are, ye may feel in soul and body the aid of His grace.</p>
