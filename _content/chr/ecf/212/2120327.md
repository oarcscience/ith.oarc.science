<span id="iii.v.i.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xxv-p2"></span>To Peter, Bishop of Terracina.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxv-p3"></span>Gregory to Peter, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxv-p4"></span>Joseph, a Jew, the bearer of these
presents, has informed us that, the Jews dwelling in the camp of
Terracina having been accustomed to assemble in a certain place for
celebrating their festivities, thy Fraternity had expelled them thence,
and that they had migrated, and this with thy knowledge and consent, to
another place for in like manner observing their festivities; and now
they complain that they have been expelled anew from this same place. 
But, if it is so, we desire thy Fraternity to abstain from giving cause
of complaint of this kind, and that they be allowed, as has been the
custom, to assemble in the place which, as we have already said, they
had obtained with thy knowledge for their place of meeting.  For those
who dissent from the Christian religion must needs be gathered together
to unity of faith by gentleness, kindness, admonition, persuasion, lest
those whom the sweetness of preaching and the anticipated terror of
future judgment might have invited to believe should be repelled by
threats and terrors.  It is right, then, that they should come together
kindly to hear the word of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxv-p4.1"></span>God</span> from you rather than that they
should become afraid of overstrained austerity.
