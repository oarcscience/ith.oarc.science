<span id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter I.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>That the unskilful venture not to
approach an office of authority.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p3.1"></span>No</span> one presumes to teach an art
till he has first, with intent meditation, learnt it.  What rashness is
it, then, for the unskilful to assume pastoral authority, since the
government of souls is the art of arts!  For who can be ignorant that
the sores of the thoughts of men are more occult than the sores of the
bowels?  And yet how often do men who have no knowledge whatever of
spiritual precepts fearlessly profess themselves physicians of the
heart, though those who are ignorant of the effect of drugs blush to
appear as physicians of the flesh!  But because, through the ordering of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p3.2"></span>God</span>, all the
highest in rank of this present age are inclined to reverence religion,
there are some who, through the outward show of rule within the holy
Church, affect the glory of distinction.  They desire to appear as
teachers, they covet superiority to others, and, <span id="page_2b">p.
2b</span> <span id="iii.iv.ii.ii-Page_2b"></span>as the Truth attests,
they seek the first salutations in the market-place, the first rooms at
feasts, the first seats in assemblies ([Matt.
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#007)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p3.3"></span>), being all the less able to administer
worthily the office they have undertaken of pastoral care, as they have
reached the magisterial position of humility out of elation only.  For,
indeed, in a magisterial position language itself is confounded when one
thing is learnt and another taught <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[1265](#fn_1264) .  Against such the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.2"></span>Lord</span> complains by
the prophet, saying, *They have reigned, and not by Me; they have been
set up as princes, and I knew it not* ([Hos. viii.
4](../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#004)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.3"></span>).  For those reign of themselves, and not
by the Will of the Supreme Ruler, who, supported by no virtues, and in
no way divinely called, but inflamed by their own desire, seize rather
than attain supreme rule.  But them the Judge within both advances, and
yet knows not; for whom by permission he tolerates them surely by the
judgment of reprobation he ignores.  Whence to some who come to Him even
after miracles He says, *Depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity, I know
you not who ye are* ([Luke xiii.
27](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#027)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.4"></span>).  The unskilfulness of shepherds is
rebuked by the voice of the Truth, when it is said through the prophet,
*The shepherds themselves have not known understanding* ([Isa.
1:0](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#000), [Isa.
56:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#011)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.5"></span>); whom again the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.6"></span>Lord</span> denounces, saying, *And they
that handle the law knew Me not* ([Jer. ii.
8](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#008)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.7"></span>).  And therefore the Truth complains of
not being known of them, and protests that He knows not the principality
of those who know not Him; because in truth these who know not the
things of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.8"></span>Lord</span> are unknown of the <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.9"></span>Lord</span>; as Paul
attests, who says, *But if any man knoweth not, he shall not be known*
([1 Cor. xiv. 38](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#038)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.10"></span>).  Yet this unskilfulness of the
shepherds doubtless suits often the deserts of those who are subject to
them, because, though it is their own fault that they have not the light
of knowledge, yet it is in the dealing of strict judgment that through
their ignorance those also who follow them should stumble.  Hence it is
that, in the Gospel, the Truth in person says, *If the blind lead the
blind, both fall into the ditch* ([Matth. xv.
14](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.11"></span>).  Hence the Psalmist (not expressing
his own desire, but in his ministry as a prophet) denounces such, when
he says, *Let their eyes be blinded that they see not, and ever bow thou
down their back* ([Psa. 69.24](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#024)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.12"></span> <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[1266](#fn_1265) ).  For, indeed, those persons are
eyes who, placed in the very face of the highest dignity, have
undertaken the office of spying out the road; while those who are
attached to them and follow them are denominated backs.  And so, when
the eyes are blinded, the back is bent, because, when those who go
before lose the light of knowledge, those who follow are bowed down to
carry the burden of their sins.

<span id="fn_1264"></span>[2b:1265](2120235.htm#fr_1264) <span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p3.4"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4"></span> In this passage the phrase
*magisterium humilitatis* has reference to [Matt.
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#025), [Luke
22:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#025), [Gen.
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#007)<span
id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p4.1"></span>.  The meaning appears to be that, when
men seek and attain in a spirit of pride the office which according to
our Lord’s teaching is one of humility, they are incapable of fulfilling
its duties by speaking to others so to be understood and edify.  They
are as the arrogant builders of Babel, whose language the Lord
confounded, that they might not understand one another’s speech.
