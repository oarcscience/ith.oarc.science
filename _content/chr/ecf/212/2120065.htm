<p class="c32"><a name="ii.iv.lv-p2"></A>A series of Letters.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.lv-p3"></A>(1)&#160; From Valentinian the Emperor to Theodosius Augustus.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.iv.lv-p4"></A>(2)&#160; From Galla Placidia Augusta to Theodosius Augustus.</p>

<p><a name="ii.iv.lv-p6"></A>(4)&#160; From Galla Placidia Augusta to Pulcheria Augusta, all graphically describing how Leo had appealed to them in public to press his suit with Theodosius.&#160; Of these, LVI. is subjoined as perhaps the most interesting specimen.</p>  
<p class="c23"><a name="ii.iv.lv-p7"></A><span class="c16"><a name="ii.iv.lv-p7.1"></A>Letter LVI.</span></p>

<p class="c18"><a name="ii.iv.lv-p9"></A>To the <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.lv-p9.1"></A>Lord</span> Theodosius, Conqueror and  <A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.lv-Page_58"></A>Emperor, her ever august son, Galla Placidia, most pious and prosperous, perpetual Augusta and mother.</p>  
<p><a name="ii.iv.lv-p10"></A>When on our very arrival in the ancient city, we were engaged in paying our devotion to the most blessed Apostle Peter, at the martyr&#146;s very altar, the most reverend Bishop Leo waiting behind awhile after the service uttered laments over the catholic Faith to us, and taking to witness the chief of the Apostles himself likewise, whom we had just approached, and surrounded by a number of bishops whom he had brought together from numerous cities in Italy by the authority and dignity of his position, adding also tears to his words, called upon us to join our moans to his own.&#160; For no slight harm has arisen from those occurrences, whereby the standard of the catholic Faith so long guarded since the days of our most Divine father Constantine, who was the first in the palace to stand out as a Christian, has been recently disturbed by the assumption of one man, who in the synod held at Ephesus is alleged to have rather stirred up hatred and contention, intimidating by the presence of soldiers, Flavianus, the bishop of Constantinople, because he had sent an appeal to the Apostolic See, and to all the bishops of these parts by the hands of those who had been deputed to attend the Synod by the most reverend Bishop of Rome, who have been always wont so to attend, most sacred <span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.lv-p10.1"></A>Lord</span> and Son and adored King, in accordance with the provisions of the Nicene Synod&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">383</FONT></A>
.&#160; For this cause we pray your clemency to oppose such disturbances with the Truth, and to order the Faith of the catholic religion to be preserved without spot, in order that according to the standard and decision of the Apostolic See, which we likewise revere as pre-eminent, Flavianus may remain altogether uninjured in his priestly office, and the matter be referred to the Synod of the Apostolic See, wherein assuredly he first adorned the primacy, who was deemed worthy to receive the keys of heaven:&#160; for it becomes us in all things to maintain the respect due to this great city, which is the mistress of all the earth; and this too we must most carefully provide that what in former times our house guarded seem not in our day to be infringed, and that by the present example schisms be not advanced either between the bishops or the most holy churches.</p>
