<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.ii.i-p4"></A>Gregory to Velox, &amp;c.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.ii.i-p5"></A>We informed your Glory some time ago that soldiers had been prepared to come to your parts; but, inasmuch as your letter had signified to us that the enemy were collected and were marching hitherward, we for this reason have detained them here.&#160; But now it appears to be advantageous that a certain number of soldiers should be sent to you, whom let thy Glory be careful to admonish and exhort to be prepared for toil.&#160; And, when you find an opportunity, confer with our glorious sons Maurilius and Vitalianus, and do whatever, with the help of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.i-p5.1"></A>God</span>, they may appoint you to do for the advantage of the republic.&#160; And, should you ascertain that the unspeakable Ariulph&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1394"></A><A HREF="#fn_1394"><FONT SIZE="1">1395</FONT></A>
 is making an incursion hitherward or to the parts about Ravenna, do you labour in his rear, as becomes brave men, to the end that your renown may by <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.i-p6.1"></A>God&#146;s</span> help advance still more in the republic from the quality of your labour.&#160; This, however, before all, we admonish you to do:&#160; to release without any delay or excuse the family of Maloin and Adobin, Vigild and Grussing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1395"></A><A HREF="#fn_1395"><FONT SIZE="1">1396</FONT></A>
, who are known to be with the glorious <i>Magister militum</i> Maurilius, to the end that the men of the aforesaid Maurilius, when they come to your parts, may without any impediment march along with them.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.ii.i-p6"></A> Ariulph was the Lombard Duke of Spoletum, one of the principal cities in Italy occupied by the Lombards.&#160; For further reference to him cf. II. 29, 30, 46; IX. 98.&#160; He was at this time preparing, and suspected by Gregory of such intention, for an attack on Rome.&#160; Cf. <i>Prologom</i>.&#160; Velox (to whom this letter is addressed), and Maurilius and Vitalian (alluded to in it, and addressed in <i>Epp</i>. 29, 30), were Roman Generals (<i>magistri militum</i>) in command of imperial forces:&#160; but where they were is not apparent.&#160; From an allusion to Suana (or <i>Soana</i>) as within reach of the last two they may be supposed to have been somewhere in Tuscia.</p>
