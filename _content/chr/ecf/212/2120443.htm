<p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p1.1"></A>Epistle XXX.</span></p>  
<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p2"></A>To Constantina Augusta.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p3"></A>Gregory to Constantina, &amp;c.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p4"></A>The Serenity of your Piety, conspicuous for religious zeal and love of holiness, has charged me with your commands to send to you the head of Saint Paul, or some other part of his body, for the church which is being built in honour of the same Saint Paul in the palace.&#160; And, being desirous of receiving commands from you, by exhibiting the most ready obedience to which I might the more provoke your favour towards me, I am all the more distressed that I neither can nor dare do what you enjoin.&#160; For the bodies of the apostles   <A NAME="page_155b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-Page_155b"></A>Saint Peter and Saint Paul glitter with so great miracles and terrors in their churches that one cannot even go to pray there without great fear.&#160; In short, when my predecessor, of blessed memory, was desirous of changing the silver which was over the most sacred body of the blessed apostle Peter, though at a distance of almost fifteen feet from the same body, a sign of no small dreadfulness appeared to him.&#160; Nay, I too wished in like manner to amend something not far from the most sacred body of Saint Paul the apostle; and, it being necessary to dig to some depth near his sepulchre, the superintendent of that place found some bones, which were not indeed connected with the same sepulchre; but, inasmuch as he presumed to lift them and transfer them to another place, certain awful signs appeared, and he died suddenly.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p5"></A>Besides all this, when my predecessor, of holy memory, was desiring in like manner to make some improvements not far from the body of Saint Laurence the martyr, it not being known where the venerable body was laid, diggings were made in the course of search, and suddenly his sepulchre was unawares disclosed; and those who were present and working, monks and <i>mansionarii</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1552"></A><A HREF="#fn_1552"><FONT SIZE="1">1553</FONT></A>
, who saw the body of the same martyr, which they did not indeed presume to touch, all died within ten days, so that none might survive who had seen the holy body of that righteous man.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p7"></A>Moreover, let my most tranquil lady know that it is not the custom of the Romans, when they give relics of saints, to presume to touch any part of the body; but only a cloth (<i>brandeum</i>) is put into a box (<i>pyxide</i>), and placed near the most sacred bodies of the saints:&#160; and when it is taken up it is deposited with due reverence in the Church that is to be dedicated, and such powerful effects are thereby produced there as might have been if their bodies had been brought to that special place.&#160; Whence it came to pass in the times of Pope Leo, of blessed memory, as has been handed down from our forefathers, that, certain Greeks being in doubt about such relics, the aforesaid pontiff took scissors and cut this same cloth (<i>brandeum</i>), and from the very incision blood flowed.&#160; For in the Roman and all the Western parts it is unendurable and sacrilegious for any one by any chance to desire to touch the bodies of saints:&#160; and, if one should presume to do this, it is certain that this temerity will by no means remain unpunished.&#160; For this reason we greatly wonder at the custom of the Greeks, who say that they take up the bones of saints; and we scarcely believe it.&#160; For certain Greek monks who came here more than two years ago dug up in the silence of night near the church of Saint Paul, bodies of dead men lying in the open field, and laid up their bones to be kept in their own possession till their departure.&#160; And, when they were taken and diligently examined as to why they did this, they confessed that they were going to carry those bones to Greece to pass for relics of saints.&#160; From this instance, as has been already said, the greater doubt has been engendered in us whether it be true that they really take up the bones of saints, as they are said to do.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p8"></A>But what shall I say of the bodies of the blessed apostles, when it is well known that, at the time when they suffered, believers came from the East to recover their bodies as being those of their own countrymen?&#160; And, having been taken as far as the second milestone from the city, they were deposited in the place which is called Catacumbas.&#160; But, when the whole multitude came together and endeavoured to remove them thence, such violence of thunder and lightning terrified and dispersed them that they on no account presumed to attempt such a thing again.&#160; And then the Romans, who of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p8.1"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> loving-kindness were counted worthy to do this, went out and took up their bodies, and laid them in the places where they are now deposited.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p9"></A>Who then, most serene lady, can there be so venturesome as, knowing these things, to presume, I do not say to touch their bodies, but even at all to look at them?&#160; Such orders therefore having been given me by you, which I could by no means have obeyed, it has not, so far as I find, been of your own motion; but certain men have wished to stir up your Piety against me, so as to withdraw from me (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p9.1"></A>God</span> forbid) the favour of your good will, and have therefore sought out a point in which I might be found as if disobedient to you.&#160; But I trust in Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p9.2"></A>God</span> that your most kind good will is in no way being stolen away from me, and that you will always have with you the power of the holy apostles, whom with all your heart and mind you love, not from their bodily presence, but from their protection.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-p10"></A>Moreover, the napkin, which you have likewise ordered to be sent you, is with his body, and so cannot be touched, as his body cannot be approached.&#160; But since so religious a desire of my most serene lady ought not to be wholly unsatisfied, I will make haste to transmit to you some portion of the chains which Saint   <A NAME="page_156b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.iv.xxii-Page_156b"></A>Peter the apostle himself bore on his neck and his hands, from which many miracles are displayed among the people; if at least I should succeed in removing it by filing.&#160; For, while many come frequently to seek a blessing from these same chains, in the hope of receiving a little part of the filings, a priest attends with a file, and in the case of some seekers a portion comes off so quickly from these chains that there is no delay:&#160; but in the case of other seekers the file is drawn for long over the chains, and yet nothing can be got from them.&#160; In the month of June, Indiction 12.</p>
