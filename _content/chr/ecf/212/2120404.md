id="iii.v.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xviii-p2"></span>To Peter, Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xviii-p3"></span>Gregory to Peter, subdeacon of
Campania <span id="fr_1489"></span>[1490](#fn_1489) .

<span id="iii.v.iii.xviii-p5"></span>Our brother and fellow-bishop Paul
has often requested us to allow him to return to his own church.  And,
having perceived this to be reasonable, we have thought it needful to
accede to his petition.  Consequently let thy Experience convene the
clergy of the Neapolitan church, to the end that they may choose two or
three of their number, and not omit to send them hither for the election
of a bishop.  But let them also intimate, in their communication to us,
that those whom they send represent them all in this election, so that
their church may have its own bishop validly ordained.  For we cannot
allow it to be any longer without a ruler of its own.  Should they
perchance try in any way to set aside thy admonition, bring to bear on
them the vigour of ecclesiastical discipline.  For he will be giving
proof of his own perverseness, whosoever does not of his own accord
assent to this proceeding.  Moreover, cause to be given to the aforesaid
Paul, our brother and fellow-bishop, one hundred *solidi*, and one
little orphan boy, to be selected by himself, for his labour in behalf
of the same church.  Further, admonish those who are to come hither as
representing all for the election of a bishop, to remember that they
must bring with them all the episcopal vestments, and also as much money
as they may foresee to be necessary for him who may be elected bishop to
have to his own use.  But lose no time in despatching those of the
clergy who are selected as we have said, that, seeing that there are
present here divers nobles of the city of Naples, we may treat with them
concerning the election of a bishop, and take counsel together with the
help of the <span class="sc"><span
