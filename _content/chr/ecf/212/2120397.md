id="iii.v.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Epistle XV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.xi-p2"></span>To Scholasticus, Judge.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xi-p3"></span>Gregory to Scholasticus, judge of
Campania.

<span id="iii.v.iii.xi-p4"></span>While we were greatly distressed in
our care for the city of Naples, bereaved of the solace of a
priest <span id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481) , the arrival of the
bearers of these presents with the decree for the election of our
subdeacon Florentius, had afforded us some relief under so great a
burden of thought.  But, when it appeared that our said subdeacon,
flying from the very city, had deprecated his ordination with tears,
know ye that our sadness <span id="page_128b">p. 128b</span> <span
id="iii.v.iii.xi-Page_128b"></span>increased, as if from some heavier
dispensation.  Wherefore, greeting you well, we exhort your Greatness to
assemble the chief men or the people of the city, so as to take thought
for the election of another, who may be worthy to be promoted to the
priesthood with the consolation of Christ.  Then, the decree having been
solemnly passed, and transmitted to this city, let the ordination
proceed, with the help of Christ, among yourselves.  But, should you not
find a suitable person on whom you can agree, at any rate choose ye
three upright and wise men, to be sent to this city as representing the
community, and to whose judgment the whole population may assent. 
Perhaps, when they come hither, they will find such a one as may be
ordained as your bishop without reproach, to the end that your bereaved
city may neither within itself want an inspector of its deeds, nor, when
the care of a priest is supplied to it, afford entrance to hostile
snares from without.
