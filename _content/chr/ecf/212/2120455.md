id="iii.v.v.i-p2.1"></span>Epistle II.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.i-p3"></span>*To Felix, Bishop, and Cyriacus,
Abbot* <span id="fr_1574"></span>[1575](#fn_1574) .

<span id="iii.v.v.i-p5"></span>Gregory to Felix, &c.

<span id="iii.v.v.i-p6"></span>The tenor of the report submitted to you
sufficiently explains the complaint of the religious lady Theodosia, in
which we have found on reading it many heads of accusation, not
befitting priestly gentleness, against our brother and fellow-bishop
Januarius; so much so that, after the foundation by her of a monastery
for servants of <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.i-p6.1"></span>God</span>, all that pertains to avarice,
turbulence, and wrong is said to have been exhibited at the time of the
very dedication of the oratory.  Wherefore, if the case is as we find in
her aforesaid representation, and if you are aware that anything at all
unbecoming has been committed besides, we exhort you that, all wrongs
having first been redressed, you press upon Musicus, the abbot of the
monastery of Agilitanus <span id="fr_1575"></span>[1576](#fn_1575) ,
that he lose no time in giving the greatest attention to his monks whom
he had began to settle there, to the end that, this venerable place
being with the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.i-p7.1"></span>Lord’s</span> help set in order by you in a
decent and regular manner, neither may we be disturbed by the frequent
complaints of the aforesaid religious lady that her good desires are not
fulfilled, nor may it be to the detriment of your soul that so pious a
design should languish, as we do not believe it will, through any
neglect of yours.

<span id="iii.v.v.i-p4"></span> They had been sent by Gregory into
Sardinia with the special purpose of promoting the conversion of the
natives, which had been neglected by the bishops and clergy of the
island.  See V. 41, and IV. 23, note 8.

<span id="fn_1575"></span>[162b:1576](2120455.htm#fr_1575) <span
id="iii.v.v.i-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v.i-p7"></span> Apparently the designation of the
monastery which had been now at length founded by Theodosia in execution
of her late husband’s will.  See above, IV. 8, 15.  In IV. 15, Gregory
had acceded to her desire in view of certain difficulties in carrying
out her husband’s intention, to found a nunnery in a house of her own at
Cagliari.  But it seems that a monastery of monks had in the end been
founded.
