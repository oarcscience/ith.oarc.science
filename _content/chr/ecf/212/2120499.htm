<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.xiii-p3"></A>Gregory to Theotistus, kinsman of the Emperor.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xiii-p4"></A>We know that the Christianity of your Excellency is always intent on good works and therefore we provide for you occasions for reaping reward, which you are certain to be glad of, so that we by so providing may have a share in your merits.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xiii-p5"></A>We therefore inform you that John the presbyter, the bearer of these presents, has come out free from those by whom he had been accused.&#160; For having, according to his request held a council, and subjected his faith to a subtle scrutiny, we found him guiltless of any wrong confession.&#160; And, inasmuch as he appeared to be, by the mercy of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xiii-p5.1"></A>God</span>, a professor and follower of the right faith, we absolved him by our definite sentence; especially as his accusers professed that they did not know what the heresy of the Marcionists, which they spoke of, was.&#160; On this account, saluting you with paternal affection, we request you to protect him with the grace of your favour.&#160; And, lest any one hereafter should be disposed to afflict him to no purpose, or in any way to cause him annoyance in this matter, let the advocacy of your Excellency so protest and defend him&#8212;and this the more instantly in consideration of your own reward&#8212;that no unjust affliction may any more consume him, and that the Creator and Redeemer of the human race, whom you worship with a sincere confession, may recompense your action in this behalf among your many good works.&#160; The month of October.&#160; Indiction 14.</p>
