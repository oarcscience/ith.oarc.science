<span id="ii.v.viii"></span>

<span id="ii.v.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>Sermon XVII.</span>

<span id="ii.v.viii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p2.1"></span>On the Fast of the Tenth Month, VI.</span>

<span id="ii.v.viii-p3"></span>I.  *The duty of fasting is based on both
the Old and New Testaments, and is closely connected with the duties of
prayer and almsgiving.*

<span id="ii.v.viii-p4"></span>The teaching of the Law, dearly beloved,
imparts great authority to the precepts of the Gospel, seeing that
certain things are transferred from the old ordinances to the new, and
by the very devotions of the Church it is shown that the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.viii-p4.1"></span>Lord</span> Jesus Christ
“came not <span id="page_126">p. 126</span> <span
id="ii.v.viii-Page_126"></span>to destroy but to fulfil the Law <span
id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708) .”  For since the cessation of the
signs by which our Saviour’s coming was announced, and the abolition of
the types in the presence of the Very Truth, those things which our
religion instituted, whether for the regulation of customs or for the
simple worship of <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p5.2"></span>God</span>, continue with us in the same form
in which they were at the beginning, and what was in harmony with both
Testaments has been modified by no change.  Among these is also the
solemn fast of the tenth month, which is now to be kept by us according
to yearly custom, because it is altogether just and godly to give thanks
to the Divine bounty for the crops which the earth has produced for the
use of men under the guiding hand of supreme Providence.  And to show
that we do this with ready mind, we must exercise not only the
self-restraint of fasting, but also diligence in almsgiving, that from
the ground of our heart also may spring the germ of righteousness and
the fruit of love, and that we may deserve <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p5.3"></span>God’s</span> mercy by showing mercy to His
poor.  For the supplication, which is supported by works of piety, is
most efficacious in prevailing with <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p5.4"></span>God</span>, since he who turns not his heart
away from the poor soon turns himself to hear the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p5.5"></span>Lord</span>, as the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p5.6"></span>Lord</span> says:  “be ye merciful as your
Father also is merciful.…release and ye shall be released <span
id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709) .”  What is kinder than this justice?
what more merciful than this retribution, where the judge’s sentence
rests in the power of him that is to be judged?  “Give,” he says, “and
it shall be given to you <span id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710) .”  How
soon do the misgivings of distrust and the puttings off of avarice fall
to the ground, when humanity <span id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711) may
fearlessly spend what the Truth pledges Himself to repay.

<span id="ii.v.viii-p9"></span>II.  *He that lends to the <span
class="sc"><span id="ii.v.viii-p9.1"></span>Lord</span> makes a better
bargain than he that lends to man.*

<span id="ii.v.viii-p10"></span>Be stedfast, Christian giver:  give what
you may receive, sow what you may reap, scatter what you may gather. 
Fear not to spend, sigh not over the doubtfulness of the gain.  Your
substance grows when it is wisely dispensed.  Set your heart on the
profits due to mercy, and traffic in eternal gains.  Your Recompenser
wishes you to be munificent, and He who gives that you may have,
commands you to spend, saying, “Give, and it shall be given to you.” 
You must thankfully embrace the conditions of this promise.  For
although you have nothing that you did not receive, yet you cannot fail
to have what you give.  He therefore that loves money, and wishes to
multiply his wealth by immoderate profits, should rather practise this
holy usury and grow rich by such money-lending, in order not to catch
men hampered with difficulties, and by treacherous assistance entangle
them in debts which they can never pay, but to be His creditor and His
money-lender, who says, “Give, and it shall be given to you,” and “with
what measure ye measure, it shall be measured again to you <span
id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712) .”  But he is unfaithful and unfair
even to himself, who does not wish to have for ever what he esteems
desirable.  Let him amass what he may, let him hoard and store what he
may, he will leave this world empty and needy, as David the prophet
says, “for when he dieth he shall take nothing away, nor shall his glory
descend with him <span id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713) .”  Whereas if
he were considerate of his own soul, he would trust his good to Him, who
is both the proper Surety <span id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714) for
the poor and the generous Repayer of loans.  But unrighteous and
shameless avarice, which promises to do some kind act but eludes it,
trusts not <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p13.1"></span>God</span>, whose promises never fail, and
trusts man, who makes such hasty bargains; and while he reckons the
present more certain than the future, often deservedly finds that his
greed for unjust gain is the cause of by no means unjust loss.

<span id="ii.v.viii-p14"></span>III.  *Money-lending at high interest is
in all respects iniquitous.*

<span id="ii.v.viii-p15"></span>And hence, whatever result follow, the
money-lender’s trade is always bad, for it is sin either to lessen or
increase the sum, in that if he lose what he lent he is wretched, and if
he takes more than he lent he is more wretched still.  The iniquity of
money-lending must absolutely be abjured, and the gain which lacks all
humanity must be shunned.  A man’s possessions are indeed multiplied by
these unrighteous and sorry means, but the mind’s wealth decays because
usury of money is the death of the soul <span
id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715) .  For what <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p16.1"></span>God</span> thinks of such men the most holy
Prophet David makes clear, for when he asks, “<span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p16.2"></span>Lord</span>, who shall dwell in thy
tabernacle, or who shall rest upon thy holy hill <span
id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716) ?” he receives the Divine utterance in
reply, from which he learns that that man attains to eternal rest who
among other rules of holy living “hath not given his money upon
usury <span id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717) :”  and thus he who gets
deceitful gain from lending his money on usury is shown to be both an
alien from <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p18.2"></span>God’s</span> tabernacle and <span
id="page_127">p. 127</span> <span id="ii.v.viii-Page_127"></span>an
exile from His holy hill, and in seeking to enrich himself by other’s
losses, he deserves to be punished with eternal neediness.

<span id="ii.v.viii-p19"></span>IV.  *Let us avoid avarice, and share
<span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.viii-p19.1"></span>God’s</span> benefits
with others.*

<span id="ii.v.viii-p20"></span>And so, dearly beloved, do ye who with
the whole heart have put your trust in the <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p20.1"></span>Lord’s</span> promises, flee from this
unclean leprosy of avarice, and use <span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.viii-p20.2"></span>God’s</span> gift piously and wisely.  And
since you rejoice in His bounty, take heed that you have those who may
share in your joys.  For many lack what you have in plenty, and some
men’s needs afford you opportunity for imitating the Divine goodness, so
that through you the Divine benefits may be transferred to others also,
and that by being wise stewards of your temporal goods, you may acquire
eternal riches.  On Wednesday and Friday next, therefore, let us fast,
and on Saturday keep vigil with the most blessed Apostle Peter, by whose
prayers we may in all things obtain the Divine protection through Christ
our <span class="sc"><span id="ii.v.viii-p20.3"></span>Lord</span>. 
Amen.
