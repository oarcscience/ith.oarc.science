<span id="iii.v.iii.iv-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>Epistle V.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iii.iv-p2"></span>To Peter, Subdeacon.

<span id="iii.v.iii.iv-p3"></span>Gregory to Peter, Subdeacon of
Campania.

<span id="iii.v.iii.iv-p4"></span>As we have no wish to disturb the
privileges of laymen in their judgments, so, when they judge wrongfully,
we desire thee to resist them with moderate authority.  For to restrain
violent laymen is not to act against the laws, but to support law. 
Since then Deusdedit, the son-in-law of Felix of Orticellum, is said to
have done violent wrong to the bearer of these presents, and still
unlawfully to detain her property, in such sort that the dejection of
her widowhood is found not to move his compassion, but to confirm his
malice, we charge thy Experience that against the aforesaid man, as well
as in other cases wherein the aforesaid woman asserts that she suffers
prejudice, thou afford her the succour of thy protection, and not allow
her to be oppressed by any one whatever, lest either thou be found to
neglect what without prejudice to equity is commanded thee, or widows
and other poor persons, finding no help where they are, be put to
expense by the length of the journey hither.
