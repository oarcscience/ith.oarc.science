<span id="iii.v.vi.xxx-p2"></span>To Palladius, Bishop.

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxx-p3"></span>Gregory to Palladius, Bishop of
Santones in Gaul (*Saintes*).

<span id="iii.v.vi.xxx-p4"></span>Leuparic your presbyter, the bearer of
these presents, when he came to us informed us that your Fraternity has
built a church in honour of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, and
also of the martyrs Laurentius and Pancratius, and placed there thirteen
altars, of which we learn that four have remained not yet dedicated
because of your desiring to deposit there relics of the above-named
saints.  And, seeing that we have reverently supplied you with relics of
the Saints Peter and Paul, and also of the martyrs Laurentius and
Pancratius, we exhort you to receive them with reverence, and deposit
them with the help of the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.vi.xxx-p4.1"></span>Lord</span>, providing before all things
that supplies for the maintenance of those who serve there be not
wanting.
