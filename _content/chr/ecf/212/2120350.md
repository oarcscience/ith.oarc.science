<span id="iii.v.i.xlviii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xlviii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXXV.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xlviii-p2"></span>To Gennadius, Patrician, and Exarch
throughout Africa.

<span id="iii.v.i.xlviii-p3"></span>Gregory to Gennadius, Patrician, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xlviii-p4"></span>Had not such great success of the
military exploits of your Excellency arisen from the merit of your faith
and from the grace of the Christian religion, it would not have been so
greatly to be wondered at, since we know that the like has been granted
to military leaders of old time.  But when, <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xlviii-p4.1"></span>God</span> granting it, you forestall
future victories, not by carnal provision, but rather by prayers, it
becomes a matter of astonishment how your glory comes down upon you,
<span id="page_99b">p. 99b</span> <span
id="iii.v.i.xlviii-Page_99b"></span>not from counsels of this world, but
from <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xlviii-p4.2"></span>God</span>,
who bestows it from above.  For where is not the renown of your deserts
in people’s mouths?  And report goes that it is not from a desire of
shedding blood that you constantly court these wars, but for the sake of
extending the republic in which we see that <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xlviii-p4.3"></span>God</span> is worshipped, to the end
that the name of Christ may be spread abroad through subject nations by
preaching of the faith.  For, as your outward deeds of valour make you
eminent in this life, so also the inward adornment of your character,
proceeding from a clean heart, glorifies you in making you partaker of
celestial joys to come.  For we have learnt that your Excellency has
done very many things of advantage for feeding the sheep of the blessed
Peter, Prince of the apostles, so as to have restored to him no small
portions of his patrimony, which had been denuded of their proper
cultivators, by supplying them with Datitian settlers.  Whatever, then,
with Christian disposition you confer on him, you receive retribution
for through hope in the judgment to come.  Wherefore we have thought fit
to commend to your Eminence Hilarus <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387) , who is also the hearer of these
presents, that you may bestow on him (though ever with regard to
justice) your accustomed affection in matters wherein he may intimate
his need of your help.  Now, addressing to you the greeting of our
paternal charity, we beseech our <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xlviii-p5.1"></span>God</span> and Saviour mercifully to
protect your Eminence for the consolation of the holy republic, and to
fortify you with the strength of His arm for spreading His name more and
more through the neighbouring nations.
