<span id="iii.v.i.xlii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xlii-p1.1"></span>Epistle LXII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xlii-p2"></span>To Januarius, Archbishop of Caralis
(Cagliari) in Sardinia.

<span id="iii.v.i.xlii-p3"></span>Gregory to Januarius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xlii-p4"></span>If our <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xlii-p4.1"></span>Lord</span> Himself by the testimony of
Holy Scripture declares Himself to be the husband of widows and father
of orphans, we also, the members of His body, ought with the soul’s
supreme affection to set ourselves to imitate the head, and saving
justice, to stand by orphans and widows if need be.  And, having been
given to understand that Catella, a religious woman who has a son
serving here in the holy Roman Church over which under <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xlii-p4.2"></span>God</span> we preside, is
being troubled by the exactions and molestations of certain persons, we
think it needful to exhort your Fraternity by this letter not to refuse
(saving justice) to afford your protection to this same woman, knowing
that by things of this kind you both make the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xlii-p4.3"></span>Lord</span> your debtor and bind us to you
the more in the bonds of charity.  For we wish the causes of the
aforesaid woman, whether now or in future, to be terminated by your
judgment, that she may be relieved from the annoyance of legal
proceedings, and yet be by no means excused from submitting to a just
judgment.  Now I pray the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xlii-p4.4"></span>Lord</span> to direct your life in a
prosperous course towards Himself, and Himself to bring you in His mercy
to the kingdom of glory which is to come.
