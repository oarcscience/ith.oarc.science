<span id="iii.v.v.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXXVI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.xvii-p2"></span>*To Severus,* *Scholasticus*

<span id="iii.v.v.xvii-p3"></span>Gregory to Severus, *Scholasticus* to
the Exarch <span id="fr_1600"></span>[1601](#fn_1600) .

<span id="iii.v.v.xvii-p5"></span>Those who assist judges and are bound
to them by sincere attachment ought to advise them and suggest to them
what may both save their souls and not derogate from their reputation. 
This being so, since we know with what sincere loyalty you love the most
excellent Exarch, we have been careful to inform your Greatness of the
things that have been done, that, being aware of them, you may move him
to assent to them reasonably.

<span id="iii.v.v.xvii-p6"></span>Know then that Agilulph, King of the
Lombards, is not unwilling to conclude a general peace, if only the lord
Patricius will consent to an arbitration.  For he complains that many
acts of violence were committed in his regions during the time of
peace.  And since, if reasonable grounds for arbitration should be
found, he desires to have satisfaction made to himself, he also himself
promises to make satisfaction in all ways, if it should appear that any
wrong was committed on his side during the peace.  Since then it is no
doubt reasonable to agree to what he asks, there ought to be an
arbitration, that, if any wrongs have been done on either side, they may
be adjusted; so that it may be possible, with the protection of <span
class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xvii-p6.1"></span>God</span>, to establish
a general peace; for how necessary for us all this is you well know. 
Act therefore wisely as you have been wont to do, that the most
excellent Exarch may consent to this without delay, lest peace should
appear to be refused by him, as should not be.  For, should he be
unwilling to consent, he indeed \[Agilulph\] again promises to conclude
a special peace with us; but we know that divers islands and other
places would undoubtedly in that case be ruined.  However, let him \[the
Exarch\] consider these things, and hasten to make peace, to the end
that at any rate during this cessation of hostilities we may have some
degree of quiet, and the forces of the republic may with the help of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xvii-p6.2"></span>God</span> be the
better repaired for resistance.

legal adviser.
