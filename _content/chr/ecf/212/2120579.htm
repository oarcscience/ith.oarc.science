<p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p1"></A> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p1.1"></A>Epistle XXX.</span></p>  
<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p2"></A>To Eulogius, Bishop of Alexandria.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p3"></A>Gregory to Eulogius, &amp;c.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p4"></A>Our common son, the bearer of these presents, when he brought the letters of your Holiness found me sick, and has left me sick; whence it has ensued that the scanty water of my brief epistle has been hardly able to exude to the large fountain of your Blessedness.&#160; But it was a heavenly boon that, while in a state of bodily pain, I received the letter of your Holiness to lift me up with joy for the instruction of the heretics of the city of Alexandria, and the concord of the faithful, to such an extent that the very joy of my mind moderated the severity of my suffering.&#160; And indeed we rejoice with new exultation to hear of your good doings, though at the same time we by no means suppose that it is a new thing for you to act thus perfectly.&#160; For that the people of holy Church increases, that spiritual crops of corn for the heavenly garner are multiplied, we never doubted that this was from the grace of Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p4.1"></A>God</span> which flowed largely to you, most blessed ones.&#160; We therefore render thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p4.2"></A>God</span>, that we see fulfilled in you what is written, <i>Where there is much increase, there the strength of the oxen is manifest</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro014.htm#004">Prov. xiv. 4</a><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p4.3"></A>).&#160; For, if a strong ox had not drawn the plough of the tongue over the ground of the hearts of hearers, so great an increase of the faithful would by no means have sprung up.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p5"></A>But, since in the good things you do I know that you also rejoice with others, I make you a return for your favour, and announce things not unlike yours; for while the nation of the Angli, placed in a corner of the world, remained up to this time misbelieving in the worship of stocks and stones, I determined, through the aid of your prayers for me, to send to it, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p5.1"></A>God</span> granting it, a monk of my monastery for the purpose of preaching.&#160; And he, having with my leave been made bishop by the bishops of Germany, proceeded, with their aid also, to the end of the world to the aforesaid nation; and already letters have reached us telling us of his safety and his work; to the effect that he and those that have been sent with him are resplendent with such great miracles in the said nation that they seem to imitate the powers of the apostles in the signs which they display.&#160; Moreover, at the solemnity of the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p5.2"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> Nativity which occurred in this first indiction, more than ten thousand Angli are reported to have been baptized by the same our brother and fellow-bishop.&#160; This have I told you, that you may know what you are effecting among the people of Alexandria by speaking, and what in the ends of the world by praying.&#160; For your prayers are in the place where you are not, while your holy operations are shewn in the place where you are.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p6"></A>In the next place, as to the person of Eudoxius the heretic&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1751"></A><A HREF="#fn_1751"><FONT SIZE="1">1752</FONT></A>
, about whose error I have discovered nothing in the Latin language, I rejoice that I have been most abundantly satisfied by your Blessedness.&#160; For you have adduced the testimonies of the strong men, Basil, Gregory, and Epiphanius; and we acknowledge him to be manifestly slain, at whom our heroes have cast so many darts.&#160; But with regard to these errors which are proved to have arisen in the Church of Constantinople, you have replied on all heads most learnedly, and as it became you to utter the judgment of so great a see.&#160; Whence we give thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p7.1"></A>God</span>, that the tables of the covenant are still in the ark of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p7.2"></A>God</span>.&#160; For what is the priestly heart but the ark of the covenant?&#160; And since spiritual doctrine retains its vigour therein, without doubt the tables of the law are lying in it.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p8"></A>Your Blessedness has also been careful to declare that you do not now make use of proud titles, which have sprung from a root of vanity, in writing to certain persons, and   <A NAME="page_241b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 241b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-Page_241b"></A>you address me saying, <i>As you have commanded.</i>&#160; This word, <i>command</i>, I beg you to remove from my hearing, since I know who I am, and who you are.&#160; For in position you are my brethren, in character my fathers.&#160; I did not, then, command, but was desirous of indicating what seemed to be profitable.&#160; Yet I do not find that your Blessedness has been willing to remember perfectly this very thing that I brought to your recollection.&#160; For I said that neither to me nor to any one else ought you to write anything of the kind; and lo, in the preface of the epistle which you have addressed to myself who forbade it, you have thought fit to make use of a proud appellation, calling me Universal Pope.&#160; But I beg your most sweet Holiness to do this no more, since what is given to another beyond what reason demands is subtracted from yourself.&#160; For as for me, I do not seek to be prospered by words but by my conduct.&#160; Nor do I regard that as an honour whereby I know that my brethren lose their honour.&#160; For my honour is the honour of the universal Church:&#160; my honour is the solid vigour of my brethren.&#160; Then am I truly honoured when the honour due to all and each is not denied them.&#160; For if your Holiness calls me Universal Pope, you deny that you are yourself what you call me universally.&#160; But far be this from us.&#160; Away with words that inflate vanity and wound charity.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p9"></A>And, indeed, in the synod of Chalcedon and afterwards by subsequent Fathers, your Holiness knows that this was offered to my predecessors&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1752"></A><A HREF="#fn_1752"><FONT SIZE="1">1753</FONT></A>
.&#160; And yet not one of them would ever use this title, that, while regarding the honour of all priests in this world, they might keep their own before Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p10.1"></A>God</span>.&#160; Lastly, while addressing to you the greeting which is due, I beg you to deign to remember me in your holy prayers, to the end that the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xviii-p10.2"></A>Lord</span> for your intercessions may absolve me from the bands of my sins, since my own merits may not avail me.</p>
