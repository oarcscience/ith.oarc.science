<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p3"></A>Gregory to Peter, Domitian, and Elpidius, Bishops&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1687"></A><A HREF="#fn_1687"><FONT SIZE="1">1688</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p5"></A>I rejoice exceedingly that you welcomed with great joy the ordination of the most holy Cyriacus, my brother and fellow-priest.&#160; And since we have learnt from the preaching of Paul the apostle that <i>If one member rejoice, all the members rejoice with it</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#026">1 Cor. xii. 26</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p5.1"></A>), you must needs consider with how great exultation I rejoice with you in this thing, wherein not one member, but many members of Christ have rejoiced.&#160; Nevertheless, so far as I have been able to consider your Fraternity&#146;s letters on a cursory perusal, great joy has carried you away into immoderate praise of this my brother.&#160; For you say that he has appeared in the Church like the sun, so that you all cried out, <i>This is the day which the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p5.2"></A>Lord</span> hath made; let us rejoice and be glad in it</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#024">Psa. 118.24</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p5.3"></A>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1688"></A><A HREF="#fn_1688"><FONT SIZE="1">1689</FONT></A>
.&#160; Yet surely this is a promise of the life to come, seeing that it is said, <i>The righteous shall shine forth as the sun</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#043">Matt. 13:43</a>, <a href="../../../bib/apo/wis003.htm#007">Wis. 3:7</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p6.1"></A>).&#160; For, in whatsoever virtue any one may excel, how can he shine forth as the sun while still in the present life, wherein <i>The corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things</i> (<a href="../../../bib/apo/wis009.htm#015">Wisd. ix. 15</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p6.2"></A>); wherein <i>We see another law in our members warring against the law of our mind, and bringing us into captivity by the law of sin which is in our members</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023">Rom. vii. 23</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p6.3"></A>); wherein <i>Even in ourselves we have the answer of death, that we should not trust in ourselves</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#009">2 Cor. i. 9</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p6.4"></A>); wherein also the Prophet cries aloud, <i>Fear and trembling are come upon me, and darkness hath covered me</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#005">Psa. 55.5</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p6.5"></A>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1689"></A><A HREF="#fn_1689"><FONT SIZE="1">1690</FONT></A>
?&#160; For it is written also, A wise man abideth as the sun; a fool changeth as the moon (<a href="../../../bib/apo/sir027.htm#012">Ecclesiasticus 27.12</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p7.1"></A>); where the comparison of the sun is not applied to the splendour of his brightness, but to perseverance in well-doing.&#160; But the good beginning of his ordination could not as yet be praised by you with regard to perseverance.&#160; And as to your saying that you cried out, <i>This is the day which the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p7.2"></A>Lord</span> hath made</i>, you ought to have considered of whom this is said.&#160; For what comes before is this; <i>The stone which the builders refused, the same is made the head-stone of the corner.&#160; This is the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p7.3"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022">Psa. 118.22</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p7.4"></A>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1690"></A><A HREF="#fn_1690"><FONT SIZE="1">1691</FONT></A>
.&#160; And with regard to this same stone it is forthwith added, <i>This is the day which the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p8.1"></A>Lord</span> hath made</i>.&#160; For He who for strength of building is said to be a stone, for the grace of illumination is called the Day, being also made, because He became incarnate.&#160; In Him we are enjoined to rejoice and be glad, because He has overcome in us the darkness of our error by the light of His excellence.&#160; In praise of a creature, then, that expression ought not to have been used which is suitable to the Creator alone.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p9"></A>But why should I find fault with these things, knowing as I do how joy carries away the mind?&#160; For your charity engendered in you great gladness, which gladness of heart the tongue applauding followed.&#160; This being so, the praise which charity found to hand cannot now be called a fault.&#160; But to me concerning my most holy brother there should have been briefly said what I might accept with satisfaction, seeing that I knew him to be one who has long given to me especially this proof of his greatness; that, having been occupied in so many affairs of ecclesiastical administration, he has kept a tranquil heart in the midst of turbulent throngs, and always restrained himself with a gentle bearing.&#160; And this indeed is no small commendation of a great and unshaken mind, not to have been perturbed among the perturbations of business.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p10"></A>  <A NAME="page_215b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.vii.v-Page_215b"></A>Furthermore, your Fraternity should be instant in continual prayers, that Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p10.1"></A>God</span> may guard in our aforesaid brother and fellow-priest what has been well begun, and ever lead him on to what is better still.&#160; This should ever be the prayer of you, most holy ones, and of the people subject to him.&#160; For the deserts of rulers and peoples are so connected with each other that often the lives of subjects are made worse from the fault of those who are over them, and often the lives of pastors fall off from the ill desert of peoples.&#160; For that the evil doings of one who is over others does very great harm to those who are under him the Pharisees are evidence, of whom it is written, <i>Ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men.&#160; For ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013">Matth. xxiii. 13</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p10.2"></A>).&#160; And that the fault of peoples does much harm to the life of pastors we perceive in what David did (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#024">2 Kings ii. 24</a><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p10.3"></A>).&#160; For he, praised by the testimony of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p10.4"></A>God</span>, he, conscious of heavenly mysteries, being inflated by the tumour of hidden elation, sinned in numbering the people; and yet the punishment fell upon the people for David&#146;s sin.&#160; Why was this?&#160; Because in truth according to the desert of subject peoples are the hearts of rulers disposed.&#160; Now the righteous Judge rebuked the fault of the sinner by visitation on those on account of whom he sinned.&#160; But, because he himself, waxing proud of his own will, was not free from fault, he himself also received punishment of his fault.&#160; For the fierce wrath, which smote the people bodily, prostrated also the ruler of the people with inmost sorrow of heart.&#160; Consider therefore these things mutually; and, even as he who is put over you and over the people should intercede for all, so should all of you pray for his conversation and manners, that before Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p10.5"></A>God</span> both you may profit by imitation of him, and he may be aided by your deserts.&#160; Further, let us all with one accord pray continually with great weeping to the utmost of our powers for our most serene lords and their pious offspring, that protecting heavenly grace may guard their lives, and subdue the necks of the nations to the Christian empire.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.vii.v-p4"></A> Who these bishops were, who had assisted at the ordination of Cyriacus and sent a report of it to Gregory, does not appear.&#160; In the objection taken by the latter to the language of laudation with which the new patriarch had been hailed at Constantinople we may perhaps detect something of his habitual jealousy of the assumptions of the Constantinopolitan See.&#160; Of Cyriacus himself he appears to have had a high opinion and to have welcomed his accession, hoping at first that he would renounce the offensive title of &#339;cumenical bishop which had been assumed by John Jejunatur.&#160; In this, however, he was disappointed, and afterwards inveighed against the new patriarch for proud presumption no less than against the old one.</p>
