<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vi.ix-p2"></A>To Montana and Thomas.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vi.ix-p3"></A>Gregory to Montana, &amp;c.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.ix-p4"></A>Since our Redeemer, the Maker of every creature, vouchsafed to assume human flesh for this end, that, the chain of slavery wherewith we were held being broken by the grace of His Divinity, He might restore us to pristine liberty, it is a salutary deed if men whom nature originally produced free, and whom the law of nations has subjected to the yoke of slavery, be restored by the benefit of manumission to the liberty in which they were born.&#160; And so, moved by loving-kindness and by consideration of this case, we make you, Montana and Thomas, servants of the holy Roman Church which with the help of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.ix-p4.1"></A>God</span> we serve, free from this day, and Roman citizens, and we release to you all your private property.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.ix-p5"></A>And, inasmuch as thou, Montana, declarest that thou hast applied thy mind to monastic profession, we therefore this day give and grant to thee two <i>unci&aelig;</i>, which the presbyter Gaudiosus by the disposition of his last will is known to have left to thee in the way of institution&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1640"></A><A HREF="#fn_1640"><FONT SIZE="1">1641</FONT></A>
, provided that all go in all respects to the advantage of the monastery of Saint Laurence, over which the abbess Constantina presides, and in which by the mercy of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.ix-p6.1"></A>God</span> thou art about to make profession.&#160; But, if it should appear that thou hast in any way concealed any part of the property left by the above-written Gaudiosus, the whole of this must undoubtedly be transferred to the possession of our Church.</p>
