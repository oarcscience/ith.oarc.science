<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p5"></A>The account given us by Augustine, servant of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p5.1"></A>God</span>, the bearer of these presents, has made us joyful, in that he has told us that your Love is vigilant as you ought to be; and he further affirms that the presbyters and deacons and the whole congregation live in unanimity and concord.&#160; And, since the goodness of presidents is the salutary rule of their subjects, we implore Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p5.2"></A>God</span> to enkindle thee always in good works by the grace of His loving-kindness, and to keep those who are committed to thee from all temptation of diabolical deceit, and grant to them to live with thee in charity and in the manner of life that pleases Him.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p6"></A>But, since the enemy of the human race never rests from plotting against our doings, so as to deceive in some part souls that are serving <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p6.1"></A>God</span>, therefore, most beloved son, we exhort thee to exercise vigilantly thy anxious care, and so to keep those who are committed to thee by prayer and heedfulness that the prowling wolf may find no opportunity for tearing the flock:&#160; to the end that, when thou shalt have rendered to our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxxvii-p6.2"></A>God</span> unharmed those of whom thou hast undertaken the charge, He may both of His grace repay thee with rewards for thy labour and multiply in thee longings for eternal life.</p>
