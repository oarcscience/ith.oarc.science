 in thy Love&#146;s monastery, we exhort thee to receive him with all sweetness and love, and by assiduous exhortation kindle his longing for eternal life, and study to be diligently solicitous for his soul&#146;s salvation; to the end that, while by thy admonition he shall persist with devoted mind in the service of our <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vi.xxix-p5.1"></A>God</span>, it may both profit him to have left the world, and his conversion may be to the increase of thine own reward.&#160; Know, however, that he is to be so received only if his wife also should wish to be similarly converted.&#160; For, when the bodies of both have been made one by the tie of wedlock, it is unseemly that part should be converted and part remain in the world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1664"></A><A HREF="#fn_1664"><FONT SIZE="1">1665</FONT></A>
