<p><a name="iii.v.v.xvii-p5"></A>Those who assist judges and are bound to them by sincere attachment ought to advise them and suggest to them what may both save their souls and not derogate from their reputation.&#160; This being so, since we know with what sincere loyalty you love the most excellent Exarch, we have been careful to inform your Greatness of the things that have been done, that, being aware of them, you may move him to assent to them reasonably.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.v.xvii-p6"></A>Know then that Agilulph, King of the Lombards, is not unwilling to conclude a general peace, if only the lord Patricius will consent to an arbitration.&#160; For he complains that many acts of violence were committed in his regions during the time of peace.&#160; And since, if reasonable grounds for arbitration should be found, he desires to have satisfaction made to himself, he also himself promises to make satisfaction in all ways, if it should appear that any wrong was committed on his side during the peace.&#160; Since then it is no doubt reasonable to agree to what he asks, there ought to be an arbitration, that, if any wrongs have been done on either side, they may be adjusted; so that it may be possible, with the protection of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xvii-p6.1"></A>God</span>, to establish a general peace; for how necessary for us all this is you well know.&#160; Act therefore wisely as you have been wont to do, that the most excellent Exarch may consent to this without delay, lest peace should appear to be refused by him, as should not be.&#160; For, should he be unwilling to consent, he indeed [Agilulph] again promises to conclude a special peace with us; but we know that divers islands and other places would undoubtedly in that case be ruined.&#160; However, let him [the Exarch] consider these things, and hasten to make peace, to the end that at any rate during this cessation of hostilities we may have some degree of quiet, and the forces of the republic may with the help of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xvii-p6.2"></A>God</span> be the better repaired for resistance.</p>
