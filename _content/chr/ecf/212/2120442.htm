<p><a name="iii.v.iv.xxi-p4"></A>It has come to our knowledge that in the place within the province of Sardinia called Phausiana it is said to have been once the custom to ordain a bishop; but that, through stress of circumstances, the custom has for long fallen into disuse.&#160; But, as we are aware that now, owing to scarcity of priests, certain pagans remain there, living like wild beasts, and entirely ignorant of the worship of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxi-p4.1"></A>God</span>, we exhort thy Fraternity to make haste to ordain a bishop there according to the ancient way; such a one, that is, as may be suitable for this work, and may take pains to bring wanderers into the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.iv.xxi-p4.2"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> flock with pastoral zeal; that so, while he devotes himself there to the saving of souls, neither may you be found to have required what was superfluous, nor may we repent of having re-established in vain what had been once discontinued.</p>
