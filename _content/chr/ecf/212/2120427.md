id="iii.v.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Epistle VI.</span>

<span id="iii.v.iv.vi-p2"></span>To Cyprian, Deacon.

<span id="iii.v.iv.vi-p3"></span>Gregory to Cyprian, Deacon and Rector
of Sicily.

<span id="iii.v.iv.vi-p4"></span>It has been reported to us that a
native of the province of Lucania, Petronilla by name, was
converted <span id="fr_1527"></span>[1528](#fn_1527) through the
exhortation of the bishop Agnellus, and that all her property, though
she had it in her own power, she nevertheless bestowed on the monastery
which she entered even by a special deed of gift:  also that the
aforesaid bishop died leaving half of his substance to one Agnellus, his
son, who is said to be a notary of our Church, and half to the said
monastery.  But, when they had fled for refuge to Sicily because of the
calamity impending on Italy, the above-named Agnellus is said to have
corrupted her morals and defiled her, and, finding her with child, to
have seduced her from the monastery, and to have taken away with her all
her belongings, both those that had been her own and such as she might
have had given her by his own father, and that, after perpetrating such
and so great a crime, he claims these things as his own.  We therefore
exhort thy Love to cause the aforesaid man, and the above-named woman,
to be summarily brought before thee, and to institute a most thorough
enquiry into the case.  And, if thou shouldest find it to be as reported
to us, determine an affair defiled by so many iniquities with the utmost
severity of expurgation; to the end that both strict retribution may
overtake the above-named man, who has regarded neither his own nor her
condition, and that, she having been first punished and consigned to a
monastery under penance, all the property that had been taken away from
the oft above-named place, with all its fruits and accessions, may be
restored.
