id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>Epistle XXVII.</span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p2"></span>*To Rusticiana, Patrician* <span
id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413) .

<span id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p4"></span>Gregory to Rusticiana, &c.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p5"></span>On receiving the epistle of your
Excellency I was relieved by the welcome news of your welfare, hoping
that the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p5.1"></span>Lord</span> in His mercy may protect and
direct your life and doings.  But I wondered much why you have turned
from your intention and vow to accomplish a good work in respect of your
meditated journey to the holy places <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[1415](#fn_1414) , seeing that, when anything good
is by the gift of the Creator conceived in the heart, it is needful that
it be carried out with quick devotion, lest, while the cunning plotter
strives to ensnare the soul, he should afterwards suggest impediments,
whereby the mind, weakened by occupations, may fail to carry its desires
into effect.  Whence it is necessary that your Excellency should
anticipate all impediments that come in the way of pious designs, and
gasp after the fruit of good work with all the efforts of your heart,
that so you may succeed in living tranquilly in the present world and
gaining possession of a heavenly kingdom in the future.  But as to what
you have written to us of Passivus having attempted to spread some
calumnies against you, consider, on the other hand, that the most pious
emperors have not only been unwilling to listen to them, but have also
received the author of them roughly; and turn the whole hope of your
soul to Him Who powerfully prevents men in this world from doing as much
harm as they long to do, that so He may beat back the wicked intentions
of men by the opposition of His arm, and Himself mercifully shatter
their attempts, as He has been wont to do.  I entreat that the glorious
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p6.2"></span>Lord</span> Appio
and the lady Eusebia, the <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p6.3"></span>Lord</span> Eudoxius and the lady
Gregoria, be greeted in my name through you.

id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p3"></span> Other letters addressed to this
patrician lady are IV. 46; VIII. 22; XI. 44; XIII. 22.  She appears to
have been a widow, no husband being alluded to, who had migrated with
her family from Rome to Constantinople (cf. VIII. 22, and XIII. 22). 
She is spoken of in subsequent letters as a person of slender frame and
weak health, and subject to gout.  Her family, to whom greetings are
always sent, being her children either by birth or marriage, were Appio
and Eusebia, Eudoxius and Gregoria, the former, and perhaps the latter
also, being a married couple.  Strategius also, a son of Appio and
Eusebia, apparently a child, has afterwards greetings sent to him.  They
had daughters also, whose names are not given.

<span id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p6"></span> Two years later (see IV. 46, Indict.
XII. i.e. <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.ii.xiv-p6.1"></span>a.d.</span> 593–4) she appears to have
made a pilgrimage to Mount Sinai.
