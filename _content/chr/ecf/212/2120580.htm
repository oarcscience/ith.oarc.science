<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.viii.xix-p2"></A>To Dominicus.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.viii.xix-p3"></A>Gregory to Dominicus, Bishop of Carthage.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xix-p4"></A>The letter of your Holiness, which we received at the hands of the bearer of these presents, so expressed priestly moderation as to soothe us, in a manner, with the bodily presence of its author.&#160; Nor indeed does infrequency of communication cause any harm where the affection of love remains uninterrupted in one&#146;s mind.&#160; Great, moreover, is the power of charity, beloved brother, which binds hearts one to another in mutual affection with the chain of its sincerity, and suffers them not to be loosened from the cohesion of grace, which conjoins things disjoined, keeps together things united, and causes persons who are unknown by sight to be known through love.&#160; Whosoever therefore fixes his heart on the hinge of charity, him no impulse of any adversity whatever tears from the habitation of the heavenly country, since, in whatever direction he may turn himself, he parts not from the threshold of the commandments.&#160; Hence also it is said by the excellent preacher in praise of this same charity, <i>Which is the bond of perfectness</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014">Coloss. iii. 14</a><a name="iii.v.viii.xix-p4.1"></A>).&#160; We see, then, what great praise is due to that which not only engenders perfectness in the soul, but also binds it.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xix-p5"></A>Wherefore, since the language of thy letters shews thee to be inflamed with the fire of this virtue, I rejoice in the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xix-p5.1"></A>Lord</span> with abundant exultation, and hope that it may shine forth in thee more and more, seeing that the flame of the shepherd is the light of the flock.&#160; For it becomes the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xix-p5.2"></A>Lord&#146;s</span> priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1753"></A><A HREF="#fn_1753"><FONT SIZE="1">1754</FONT></A>
 to shine in manners and life, to the end that the people committed to him may be able, as it were in the mirror of his life, both to choose what to follow, and to see what to correct.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xix-p7"></A>Knowing, furthermore, whence priestly ordination took its beginning in the African parts, you act laudably in recurring with wise recollection, in your love of the Apostolic See, to the origin of your office, and in continuing with commendable constancy in your affection towards it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1754"></A><A HREF="#fn_1754"><FONT SIZE="1">1755</FONT></A>
.&#160; For indeed it is certain that whatever reverence and devotion in priestly wise you shew to it, this you add to your own honour; seeing that you hereby invite it to be bound with answering love to you.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.xix-p9"></A>It remains, most dear brother, that we beseech Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.xix-p9.1"></A>God</span> with continual prayer that He would direct the steps of our hearts into the pathway of His truth, and bring us to the heavenly kingdoms, granting us by the grace of His protection to exhibit in our works the office which we bear in name.&#160; The Month of August, first Indiction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1755"></A><A HREF="#fn_1755"><FONT SIZE="1">1756</FONT></A>
