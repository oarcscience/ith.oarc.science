<p><a name="iii.v.i.xliv-p4"></A>Customs which are found to bring a burden upon churches it becomes us in our consideration to discontinue, lest any should be forced to contribute to quarters from which they ought rather to look for contributions.&#160; Accordingly, it is thy duty to preserve intact the custom of the clergy and others, and to transmit to them every year what has been accustomed:&#160; but for the future we forbid thee to transmit anything to us.&#160; And, since we take no delight in presents (<i>xeniis</i>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1378"></A><A HREF="#fn_1378"><FONT SIZE="1">1379</FONT></A>

 which thy Fraternity has sent us, but have caused them to be sold for an adequate price, which we have transmitted separately to thy Fraternity, for fear lest thou shouldest have felt the expense.&#160; Further, since we have learnt that thy Charity is desirous of coming to us, we admonish thee by the present letter not to take the trouble of coming:&#160; but pray for us, that the more we are separated by length of way, the more we may be joined one to another in mind, with the help of Christ, by charity; to the end that, aiding each other by mutual supplication, we may resign our office unimpaired to the Judge that is to come.</p>
