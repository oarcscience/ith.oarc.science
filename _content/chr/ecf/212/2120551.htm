<p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p2"></A>To Cyriacus, Bishop.</p>  
<p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p3"></A>Gregory to Cyriacus, Bishop of Constantinople.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p4"></A>We have received the letters of your Blessedness, which speak to us in words not of the tongue but of the soul.&#160; For they open to me your mind, which, however, was not closed to me, since of myself I retain experience of the same sweetness.&#160; Wherefore I return thanks continually to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p4.1"></A>God</span>, since, if charity the mother of virtues abides in your heart towards us, you will never lose the branches of good works, seeing that you retain the very root of goodness.&#160; You ought, then, to shew the beauty of this charity to me and to all your brethren by this good work in the first place,&#8212;your hastening to discard that word of pride whereby grave offence is engendered in the Churches, thus fulfilling in all ways what is written, <i>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#003">Ephes. iv. 3</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p4.2"></A>):&#160; and again, <i>Give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#014">1 Tim. v. 14</a><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p4.3"></A>).&#160; For then will true charity be displayed, if there is no schism among us through an example of pride.&#160; For, as for me, I call Jesus to witness in my soul, that to no one among men from the highest to the lowest do I wish to give occasion of offence.&#160; I desire that all should be great and honourable, yet so that their honour detract not from the honour of Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p4.4"></A>God</span>.&#160; For whoso covets to be honoured against <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p4.5"></A>God</span> to me is not honourable.&#160; But, that you may learn what good will I have towards your Blessedness, I have sent my son the deacon Anatolius to the feet of our most pious lords, for satisfying their Piety and your Fraternity that I desire to injure no man in this matter, but to keep the humility that is pleasing to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p4.6"></A>God</span>, and the concord of holy Church.&#160; And because Antichrist, the enemy of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p4.7"></A>God</span>, is near at hand, I studiously desire the he may not find anything belonging to himself, not only in the manners, but even in the titles of priests.&#160; Let then what has been introduced after a new fashion be removed in like manner as it was brought in, and peace in the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p4.8"></A>Lord</span> will remain with us inviolate.&#160; For what pleasantness, what charity, will there be amongst us, if we cheer ourselves up with words, while we are galled by facts?&#160; Let then your Holiness so act that we may feel in our inmost hearts the good things you speak of, to the end that, the hearts of priests being in unanimity, when we supplicate for the life of our most pious lords, we may be counted worthy to be heard all the more as peace illuminates your prayers before the eyes of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.vii.xix-p4.9"></A>God</span>, and no stain of discord darkens them.</p>
