<span id="ii.iv.xxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c16"><span
id="ii.iv.xxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter XXVII.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="ii.iv.xxvii-p2.1"></span>To Flavian, Bishop of
Constantinople.</span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxvii-p3"></span>Leo to Flavian, bishop of
Constantinople.

<span id="ii.iv.xxvii-p4"></span>An acknowledgment of Flavian’s first
letter and a promise of a fuller reply.

<span id="ii.iv.xxvii-p5"></span>On the first opportunity we could find,
which was the coming of our honourable son Rodanus, we acknowledge,
beloved, the arrival of your packet <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241) , which was to give us information
about the case which has been stirred up to our grief among you by
misguided error.  Since this man, who has long seemed to be religiously
disposed, has expressed himself in the Faith otherwise than is right,
though he never ought to have departed from the catholic tradition, but
to have persevered in the same belief as is held by all.  But on this
matter we are replying more fully <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242) by him who brought your letter to us,
beloved:  that we may give you all necessary instructions, beloved, on
the whole matter.  For we do not allow either him to persist in his
perverse conviction; or you, beloved, who with such faithful zeal are
resisting his wrong and foolish error to be long disturbed by the
adversary’s opposition.  Our aforesaid son, by whom we are sending this
letter, we desire you to receive with the affection he deserves, and to
reply when he returns to us.  Dated 21st May in the consulship of
Asturius and Protogenes (449).

<span id="ii.iv.xxvii-p6"></span> *Epistolas*.  This refers to Lett.
XXII., and includes the *gesta* (or minutes of the synod’s proceedings)
which accompanied it.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[38:243](2120037.htm#fr_242) <span
id="ii.iv.xxvii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv.xxvii-p7"></span> This is the Tome (Letter XXVIII.):  it
will be noticed that Flavian (in Lett. XXII.) had not asked for any
instructions, but only that Leo should inform the bishops under his
jurisdiction of Eutyches’ deposition (chap. iv.).  Flavian’s second
letter (XXVI.), however, does mention *vestras sacras litteras*, which
he hopes will avoid the necessity of a council (chap. iii.).  Leo
himself seems to be conscious of this:  for in Letter XXXIII., chap. 2,
he twice pointedly puts in the word “seems,” as if Flavian had not
expressed himself quite clearly:  “the points which he seems to have
referred to us,” and “this error which seems to have arisen.”
