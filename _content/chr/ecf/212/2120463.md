<span id="iii.v.v.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.v.ix-p1.1"></span>Epistle XIX.</span>

<span id="iii.v.v.ix-p2"></span>*To Sabinianus, Deacon* <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588) .

<span id="iii.v.v.ix-p4"></span>Gregory to Sabinianus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.v.ix-p5"></span>In the cause of our brother the most
reverend John, bishop of Constantinople, I have been unwilling to write
two letters.  But one I have drawn up briefly, which may seem to combine
both requisites; that is to say, both honesty and kindness.

<span id="iii.v.v.ix-p6"></span>Let therefore thy Love take care to give
him this letter which I have now addressed to him in compliance with the
wish of the Emperor.  For in the sequel another will be sent him such as
his pride will not rejoice in.  For he has come even to this; that,
taking occasion of the case of John the presbyter, he transmitted hither
the acts, wherein almost in every line he called himself <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.v.v.ix-p6.1"></span>οἰκουμενικὸν</span>
(*œcumenical*) patriarch.  But I hope in Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.ix-p6.2"></span>God</span> that the Supernal Majesty will
confound his hypocrisy.  But I wonder how he could so deceive thy Love
as that thou shouldest allow the lord Emperor to be persuaded to write
to me himself concerning this matter, admonishing me to have peace with
him.  For, if the lord Emperor wishes to observe justice, he ought to
have admonished him to refrain from the proud title, and then at once
there would be peace between us.  I suspect, however, that thou hast not
all considered with what cunningness this has been done by our aforesaid
brother John.  For it is for this purpose that he has done it; that the
lord Emperor might be obeyed, and so he himself might seem to be
confirmed in his vanity, or that I might not obey him, and so his mind
might be irritated against me.  But we will keep to the right way,
fearing nothing in this cause except the Almighty <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.v.ix-p6.3"></span>Lord</span>.  Wherefore let thy Love be in
nothing afraid.  All things that you see to be lofty in this world
against the truth in behalf of the truth despise; trust in the grace of
Almighty <span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.ix-p6.4"></span>God</span>,
and the help of the blessed Apostle Peter.  Remember the voice of the
Truth, which says, *Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the
world* ([1 John iv. 4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#004)<span
id="iii.v.v.ix-p6.5"></span>); and in this cause whatever has to be
done, do it with the utmost authority.  For now that we can in no wise
be protected from the swords of our enemies, now that for love of the
republic we have lost silver, gold, slaves and clothing, it is too
ignominious that through those men we should lose even the faith.  For
to assent to that atrocious title is nothing else than to lose the
faith.  Wherefore, as I have written to thee already in former letters,
never do thou presume to proceed with him <span

<span id="iii.v.v.ix-p3"></span> Sabinianus was at this time the pope’s
*apocrisiarius*, or *responsalis*, at Constantinople.

<span id="iii.v.v.ix-p7"></span> *Cum eo procedere*, i.e. in effect, to
communicate with him.  *Procedere* means to approach the altar for
celebration.  Cf. III. 57, “ingredientibus diaconibus ut mox
procedatur.”
