<p><a name="iii.v.viii.ix-p4"></A>How necessary it is to provide for the quiet of monasteries&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1738"></A><A HREF="#fn_1738"><FONT SIZE="1">1739</FONT></A>
, and to take measures for their perpetual security, you are aware from the office you formerly filled in government of a monastery.&#160; And so, seeing that we have learnt how the monastery of the blessed John and Stephen in the city of Classis, over which our common son, the abbot Claudius, is known to preside, has suffered many prejudices and grievances from your predecessors, it is right that the provision of your Fraternity should make salutary arrangements for the quiet of its inmates in future; to the end that living there in the service of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.ix-p5.1"></A>God</span>, His grace also assisting them, they may persevere with free mind.&#160; But lest, owing to the custom which ought rather to be amended, any one at any time should presume to cause any annoyance there, it is necessary that the points which we have taken care to enumerate below be so guarded by the careful attention of your Fraternity that no occasion of causing them disquiet may possibly be found in future.&#160; Let no one, then, any more dare, by any kind of inquisition whatever, to diminish anything from the revenues or charters of the aforesaid monastery, or of any place that in any manner whatever pertains to it, or to attempt any kind of usurpations or stratagems.&#160; But if perchance any matter of dispute should arise between the Church of Ravenna and the aforesaid monastery, and it cannot be settled amicably, let it be concluded without voluntary delay before men who fear <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.ix-p5.2"></A>God</span> chosen by the parties, oath being made upon the most holy Gospels.&#160; Further, on the death of an abbot, let not a stranger be ordained, but one whom the congregation may choose of its own free will for itself from the same congregation, and who shall have been chosen without any fraud or venality.&#160; But, if they should be unable to find a suitable person among themselves, let them  <A NAME="page_236b"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236b</FONT></A> <a name="iii.v.viii.ix-Page_236b"></A>in like manner wisely choose for themselves for ordination one from some other monastery.&#160; And, when an abbot comes, let no person whatever on any occasion whatever be put over him in his own monastery, unless perchance in the case (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.ix-p5.3"></A>God</span> forbid) of crimes which are shewn to be punishable by the sacred canons.&#160; This rule also must be no less carefully observed; that against the will of the abbot of such monastery monks be not removed thence for furnishing other monasteries, or for sacred orders, or for any clerical office.&#160; But in cases of there being monks in abundance, sufficient for celebrating praises to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.ix-p5.4"></A>God</span> and for satisfying the requirements of monasteries, let the abbot offer with devotion of those who are to spare, such as he may be able to find worthy in the sight of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.viii.ix-p5.5"></A>God</span>.&#160; But if, while having a sufficient number he should refuse to give any, then let the bishop of Ravenna take of such as are to spare for furnishing other monasteries.&#160; Nevertheless, let no one be taken out thence for an ecclesiastical office, except such as the abbot of the place, on having notice given him, may offer of his own accord.&#160; Whosoever also from the aforesaid monastery shall have attained to any ecclesiastical order, let him thenceforth have neither any power there nor leave to dwell there&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1739"></A><A HREF="#fn_1739"><FONT SIZE="1">1740</FONT></A>
.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.ix-p7"></A>It is to be observed also that no schedule of the property and charters of this monastery must be made by ecclesiastics, if ever circumstances require one:&#160; but let the abbot of the place with other abbots make an inventory of the property.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.ix-p8"></A>Further, as often as the abbot may perchance wish to go or send to the Roman pontiff in the interest of his monastery, let him have entire liberty to do so.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.v.viii.ix-p9"></A>Furthermore, though the visits of bishops should be looked for with desire by monasteries, yet, seeing that it has been reported to us that the aforesaid monastery in the times of your predecessor was burdened by occasion of entertainment, it is right that your Holiness should regulate this in a becoming manner, so that the prelate of the city may have access to the monastery as often as he pleases for the sake of visiting and exhorting.&#160; But let the bishop so fulfil the office of charity there that the monastery incur not any burden.&#160; Now the aforesaid abbot not only does not fear your Fraternity&#146;s frequent access to the monastery, but even longingly desires it, knowing that it is quite impossible that the substance of the monastery should be burdened through you.&#160; Given in the month of April, first Indiction.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.viii.ix-p6"></A> This is among the many evidences found in Gregory&#146;s Epistles that monks in his day were essentially laymen.&#160; The active duties incumbent on the clergy were held to be inconsistent with monastic life.</p>
