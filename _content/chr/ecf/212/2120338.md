<span id="iii.v.i.xxxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Epistle L.</span>

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxvi-p2"></span>*To Anthemius the Subdeacon* <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367) .

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxvi-p4"></span>Gregory to Anthemius, &c.

<span id="iii.v.i.xxxvi-p5"></span>Even as, through the ordering of
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.i.xxxvi-p5.1"></span>God</span> as it
hath pleased Him, we have received the place of government, so ought we
to be solicitous for the souls committed to us.  Now we find that in the
Eumorphian island <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368) , in which,
as is well known, there is an oratory of the blessed Peter, Prince of
the Apostles, a large number of men with their wives from various
patrimonies have fled to it for refuge, through stress of barbarian
ferocity. <span id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369)   This we consider
inexpedient:  for, there being other places of refuge near at hand, why
should women have their abode there with monks?  Wherefore we enjoin thy
Experience by this present order from this time forward to allow no
woman, whether she be under ecclesiastical jurisdiction or any other, to
take up her abode or tarry there; but let them provide for themselves a
place of refuge (there being, as has been said above, so many in the
neighbourhood) wherever they may choose; so that all intercourse with
women may henceforth be put an end to; lest, if we should desist from
taking all the care we can, and guarding against the snares of the
enemy, we henceforth (which <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.v.i.xxxvi-p7.1"></span>God</span> forbid) should be culpable in
case of anything wrong taking place.  Delay not, therefore, to give to
the abbot Felix, the bearer of these presents, one thousand five hundred
pounds of lead, which he is known to be in want of in the same island,
which may be charged afterwards in thy accounts, when the whole quantity
shall be known.  So proceed, then, that thou mayest provide thyself with
some, if any can be profitably used for the buildings of the same
island.  Moreover, since congregations of monks in the islands are
exposed to hardship, we forbid boys under eighteen years of age to be
received into these monasteries.  Or, if there are any now there, let
thy Experience remove them, and send them to the city of Rome.  We
desire thee in all respects to observe this in Palmaria also and the
other islands.
