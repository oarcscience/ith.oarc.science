<span id="iii.v.v.xv-p2"></span>*To Vincomalus, Guardian
(Defensorem)* <span id="fr_1597"></span>[1598](#fn_1597) .

<span id="iii.v.v.xv-p4"></span>Gregory to Vincomalus, &c.

<span id="iii.v.v.xv-p5"></span>With a view to the advantage of the
Church it is our will and pleasure, that, if thou art held bound by no
condition of, or liability to, bodily service, and hast not been a
cleric of any other city, and if there is no canonical objection to
thee, thou take the office of guardian of the Church, that thou mayest
execute incorruptly and with alacrity whatever may be enjoined thee by
us for the benefit of the poor, using this privilege which after
deliberation we have conferred upon thee, so as to do thy diligence
faithfully in accomplishing all that may be enjoined on thee by us, as
having to render an account of thy doings under the judgment of our
<span class="sc"><span id="iii.v.v.xv-p5.1"></span>God</span>.  This
epistle we have dictated, to be committed to writing, to Paterius,
notary of our Church; In the month of March, Indiction 13.

<span id="iii.v.v.xv-p3"></span> We have in this epistle the form of
appointment to the office of *Defensor Ecclesiæ*.  Cf. XI. 38.  From IX.
62 it appears that the functions of the office had in some cases been
usurped by persons not duly authorized, as it is there ordered that none
should be recognized but such as possessed letters of appointment.  The
only duties of the office specified in this form of appointment have
reference to the poor—“pro pauperum commodis;” but it is evident from
the many epistles addressed to *defensores*, that they had a much wider
scope.  See *Prolegomena*, p. vii.
