<span id="ix.cclxxx-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclxxx-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXIX. <span
id="fr_3237"></span>[3238](#fn_3237) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxx-p3"></span>To Modestus the Prefect.

<span id="ix.cclxxx-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxx-p4.1"></span>Although</span> so numerous are my letters,
conveyed to your excellency by as many bearers, yet, having regard to
the especial honour you have shewn me, I cannot think that their large
number causes you any annoyance.

<span id="ix.cclxxx-p5"></span>I do not hesitate therefore to entrust to
this brother the accompanying letter:  I know that he will meet with all
that he wishes, and that you will count me but as a benefactor in
furnishing occasion for the gratification of your kind inclinations.  He
craves your advocacy.  His cause he will explain in person, if you but
deign to regard him with a favourable eye, and embolden him to speak
freely in the presence of so august an authority.  Accept my assurance
that any kindness shewn to him, I shall regard as personal to myself. 
His special reason for leaving Tyana and coming to me was the high value
he attached to the presentation of a letter written by myself in support
of his application.  That he may not be disappointed of his hope; that I
may continue in the enjoyment of your consideration; that your interest
in all that is good may, in this present matter, find scope for its full
exercise—are the <span id="page_312">p. 312</span> <span
id="ix.cclxxx-Page_312"></span>grounds on which I crave a gracious
reception for him, and a place amongst those nearest to you.
