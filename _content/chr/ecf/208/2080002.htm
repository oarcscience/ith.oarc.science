<p class="c20"><a name="iii-p3"></A><span class="c14"><a name="iii-p3.1"></A>This</span> translation of a portion of the works of St. Basil was originally begun under the editorial supervision of Dr. Wace.&#160; It was first announced that the translation would comprise the <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i> and <i>Select Letters</i>, but it was ultimately arranged with Dr. Wace that a volume of the series should be devoted to St. Basil, containing, as well as the <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i>, the whole of the <i>Letters</i>, and the <i>Hex&aelig;meron</i>.&#160; The <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i> has already appeared in an English form, as have portions of the <i>Letters</i>, but I am not aware of an English translation of the <i>Hex&aelig;meron</i>, or of all the <i>Letters</i>.&#160; The <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i> was presumably selected for publication as being at once the most famous, as it is among the most valuable, of the extant works of this Father.&#160; The <i>Letters</i> comprise short theological treatises and contain passages of historical and varied biographical interest, as well as valuable specimens of spiritual and consolatory exhortation.&#160; The <i>Hex&aelig;meron</i> was added as being the most noted and popular of St. Basil&#146;s compositions in older days, and as illustrating his exegetic method and skill, and his power as an extempore preacher.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iii-p4"></A>The edition used has been that of the Benedictine editors as issued by Migne, with the aid, in the case of the <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i>, of that published by Rev. C. F. H. Johnston.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iii-p5"></A>The editorship of Dr. Wace terminated during the progress of the work, but I am indebted to him, and very gratefully acknowledge the obligation, for valuable counsel and suggestions.&#160; I also desire to record my thanks to the Rev. C. Hole, Lecturer in Ecclesiastical History at King&#146;s College, London, and to Mr. Reginald Geare, Head Master of the Grammar School, Bishop&#146;s Stortford, to the former for help in the revision of proof-sheets and important suggestions, and to the latter for aid in the translation of several of the <i>Letters</i>.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="iii-p6"></A>The works consulted in the process of translation and attempted illustration are sufficiently indicated in the notes.</p>
