<span id="ix.cclxxii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cclxxii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXI. <span
id="fr_3223"></span>[3224](#fn_3223) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxii-p3"></span>*To Eusebius,* <span
id="fr_3224"></span>[3225](#fn_3224) *my comrade, to recommend Cyriacus
the presbyter.*

<span id="ix.cclxxii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxii-p5.1"></span>At</span> once and in haste, after your
departure, I came to the town.  Why need I tell a man not needing to be
told, because he knows by experience, how distressed I was not to find
you?  How delightful it would have been to me to see once more the
excellent Eusebius, to embrace him, to travel once again in memory to
our young days, and to be reminded of old times when for both of us
there was one home, one hearth, the same schoolmaster, the same leisure,
the same work, the same treats, the same hardships, and everything
shared in common!  What do you think I would not have given to recall
all this by actually meeting you, to rid me of the heavy weight of my
old age, and to seem to be turned from an old man into a lad again?  But
I have lost this pleasure.  At least of the privilege of meeting your
excellency in correspondence, <span id="page_309">p. 309</span> <span
id="ix.cclxxii-Page_309"></span>and of consoling myself by the best
means at my disposal, I am not deprived.  I am so fortunate as to meet
the very reverend presbyter Cyriacus.  I am ashamed to recommend him to
you, and to make him, through me, your own, lest I seem to be performing
a superfluous task in offering to you what you already possess and value
as your own.  But it is my duty to witness to the truth, and to give the
best boons I have to those who are spiritually united to me.  I think
that the man’s blamelessness in his sacred position is well known to
you; but I confirm it, for I do not know that any charge is brought
against him by those who do not fear the Lord and are laying their hands
upon all.  Even if they had done anything of the kind, the man would not
have been unworthy, for the enemies of the Lord rather vindicate the
orders of those whom they attack than deprive them of any of the grace
given them by the Spirit.  However, as I said, nothing has even been
thought of against the man.  Be so good then as to look upon him as a
blameless presbyter, in union with me, and worthy of all reverence. 
Thus will you benefit yourself and gratify me.
