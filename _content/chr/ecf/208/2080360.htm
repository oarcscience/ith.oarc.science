<p class="c20"><a name="ix.cclxxxviii-p4"></A>IT is difficult to deal with this man.&#160; I scarcely know how to treat so shifty, and, to judge from the evidence, so desperate a character.&#160; When summoned before the court, he fails to appear; and if he does attend, he is gifted with such volubility of words and oaths, that I think myself well off to be quickly rid of him.&#160; I have often known him twist round his accusations upon his accusers.&#160; In a word, there is no creature living upon earth so subtile and versatile in villainy.&#160; A slight acquaintance with him suffices to prove this.&#160; Why then do you appeal to me?&#160; Why not at once bring yourselves to submit to his ill-treatment, as to a visitation of God&#146;s anger?</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cclxxxviii-p5"></A>At the same time you must not be contaminated by contact with wickedness.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cclxxxviii-p6"></A>I enjoin therefore that he and all his household be forbidden the services of the Church, and all other communion with her ministers.&#160; Being thus made an example of, he may haply be brought to a sense of his enormities.</p>
