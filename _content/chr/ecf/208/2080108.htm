<p class="c20"><a name="ix.xxxvi-p4"></A>I <span class="c14"><a name="ix.xxxvi-p4.1"></A>have</span> written to you about many people as belonging to myself; now I mean to write about more.&#160; The poor can never fail, and I can never say, no.&#160; There is no one more intimately associated with me, nor better able to do me kindnesses wherever he has the ability, than the reverend brother Leontius.&#160; So treat his house as if you had found me, not in that poverty in which now by God&#146;s help I am living, but endowed with wealth and landed property.&#160; There is no doubt that you would not have made me poor, but would have taken care of what I had, or even added to my possessions.&#160; This is the way I ask you to behave in the house of Leontius.&#160; You will get your accustomed reward from me; my prayers to the holy God for the trouble you are taking in shewing yourself a good man and true, and in anticipating the supplication of the needy.</p>
