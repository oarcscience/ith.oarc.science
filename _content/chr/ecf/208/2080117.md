<span id="ix.xlv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xlv-p1.1"></span>Letter XLIV. <span
id="fr_2091"></span>[2092](#fn_2091) </span>

<span id="ix.xlv-p3"></span>* To a lapsed Monk*. <span
id="fr_2092"></span>[2093](#fn_2092)

<span id="ix.xlv-p5"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xlv-p5.1"></span>I do</span> not wish you joy, for there is no
joy for the wicked.  Even now I cannot believe it; my heart cannot
conceive iniquity so great as the crime which you have committed; if,
that is, the truth really is what is generally understood.  I am at a
loss to think how wisdom so deep can have been made to disappear; how
such exact discipline can have been undone; whence blindness so profound
can have been shed round you; how with utter inconsiderateness you have
wrought such destruction of souls.  If this <span id="page_147">p.
147</span> <span id="ix.xlv-Page_147"></span>be true, you have given
over your own soul to the pit, and have slackened the earnestness of all
who have heard of your impiety.  You have set at nought the faith; you
have missed the glorious fight.  I grieve over you.  What cleric <span
id="fr_2093"></span>[2094](#fn_2093) does not lament as he hears?  What
ecclesiastic does not beat the breast?  What layman is not downcast? 
What ascetic is not sad?  Haply, even the sun has grown dark at your
fall, and the powers of heaven have been shaken at your destruction. 
Even senseless stones have shed tears at your madness; even your enemies
have wept at the greatness of your iniquity.  Oh hardness of heart!  Oh
cruelty!  You did not fear God; you did not reverence men; you cared
nothing for your friends; you made shipwreck of all at once; at once you
were stripped of all.  Once more I grieve over you, unhappy man.  You
were proclaiming to all the power of the kingdom, and you fell from it. 
You were making all stand in fear of your teaching, and there was no
fear of God before your eyes.  You were preaching purity, and you are
found polluted.  You were priding yourself on your poverty, and you are
convicted of covetousness; you were demonstrating and explaining the
chastisement of God, and you yourself brought chastisement on your own
head.  How am I to lament you, how grieve for you?  How is Lucifer that
was rising in the morning fallen and dashed on the ground?  Both the
ears of every hearer will tingle.  How is the Nazarite, brighter than
gold, become dark above pitch?  How has the glorious son of Sion become
an unprofitable vessel!  Of him, whose memory of the sacred Scriptures
was in all men’s mouths, the memory to-day has perished with the sound. 
The man of quick intelligence has quickly perished.  The man of manifold
wit has wrought manifold iniquity.  All who profited by your teaching
have been injured by your fall.  All who came to listen to your
conversation have stopped their ears at your fall.  I, sorrowful and
downcast, weakened in every way, eating ashes for bread and with
sackcloth on my wound, am thus recounting your praises; or rather, with
none to comfort and none to cure, am making an inscription for a tomb. 
For comfort is hid from my eyes.  I have no salve, no oil, no bandage to
put on.  My wound is sore, how shall I be healed?

<span id="ix.xlv-p7"></span>2.  If you have any hope of salvation; if
you have the least thought of God, or any desire for good things to
come; if you have any fear of the chastisements reserved for the
impenitent, awake without delay, lift up your eyes to heaven, come to
your senses, cease from your wickedness, shake off the stupor that
enwraps you, make a stand against the foe who has struck you down.  Make
an effort to rise from the ground.  Remember the good Shepherd who will
follow and rescue you.  Though it be but two legs or a lobe of an
ear, <span id="fr_2094"></span>[2095](#fn_2094) spring back from the
beast that has wounded you.  Remember the mercies of God and how He
cures with oil and wine.  Do not despair of salvation.  Recall your
recollection of how it is written in the Scriptures that he who is
falling rises and he who turns away returns; <span
id="fr_2095"></span>[2096](#fn_2095) the wounded is healed, the prey of
beasts escapes; he who owns his sin is not rejected.  The Lord willeth
not the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn and live. <span
id="fr_2096"></span>[2097](#fn_2096)   Do not despise, like the wicked
in the pit of evil. <span id="fr_2097"></span>[2098](#fn_2097)   There
is a time of endurance, a time of long suffering, a time of healing, a
time of correction.  Have you stumbled?  Arise.  Have you sinned? 
Cease.  Do not stand in the way of sinners, <span
id="fr_2098"></span>[2099](#fn_2098) but spring away.  When you are
converted and groan you shall be saved.  Out of labour comes health, out
of sweat salvation.  Beware lest, from your wish to keep certain
obligations, you break the obligations to God which you professed before
many witnesses. <span id="fr_2099"></span>[2100](#fn_2099)   Pray do not
hesitate to come to me for any earthly considerations.  When I have
recovered my dead I shall lament, I shall tend him, I will weep “because
of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.” <span
id="fr_2100"></span>[2101](#fn_2100)   All are ready to welcome you, all
will share your efforts.  Do not sink back.  Remember the days of old. 
There is salvation; there is amendment.  Be of good cheer; do not
despair.  It is not a law condemning to death without pity, but mercy
remitting punishment and awaiting improvement.  The doors are not yet
shut; the bridegroom hears; sin is not the master.  Make another effort,
do not hesitate, have pity on yourself and on all of us in Jesus Christ
our Lord, to Whom be glory and might now and for ever and ever.  Amen.
