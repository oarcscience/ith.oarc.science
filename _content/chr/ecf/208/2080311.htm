 and the angel who watches over the Church has gone out with you.&#160; So they lie down in empty places day by day, bringing upon themselves heavy judgment through the dispersion of the people.&#160; And, if in all this there is sorrow to be borne, I trust in the Lord that it will not be without its use to you.&#160; Therefore, the more have been your trials, look for a more perfect reward from your just Judge.&#160; Do not take your present troubles ill.&#160; Do not lose hope.&#160; Yet a little while and your Helper will come to you and will not tarry.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3013"></A><A HREF="#fn_3013"><FONT SIZE="1">3014</FONT></A>
