<span id="vii.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII.</span>

<span id="vii.viii-p2"></span>Against those who assert that it is not
proper for “with whom” to be said of the Son, and that the proper phrase
is “through whom.”

<span id="vii.viii-p3"></span>16.  <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.viii-p3.1"></span>But</span> their contention is that to use the
phrase “with him” is altogether strange and unusual, while “through him”
is at once most familiar in Holy Scripture, and very common in the
language of the brotherhood. <span id="fr_816"></span>[817](#fn_816)  
What is our answer to this?  We say, Blessed are the ears that have not
heard you and the hearts that have been kept from the wounds of your
words.  To you, on the other hand, who are lovers of Christ, <span
id="fr_817"></span>[818](#fn_817) I say that the Church recognizes both
uses, and deprecates neither as subversive of the other.  For whenever
we are contemplating the majesty of the nature of the Only Begotten, and
the excellence of His dignity, we bear witness that the glory is *with*
the Father; while on the other hand, whenever we bethink us of His
bestowal <span id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818) on us of good gifts,
and of our access <span id="fr_819"></span>[820](#fn_819) to, and
admission into, the household of God, <span
id="fr_820"></span>[821](#fn_820) we confess that this grace is effected
for us *through* Him and *by* <span id="fr_821"></span>[822](#fn_821)
Him.

<span id="vii.viii-p11"></span>It follows that the one phrase “with
whom” is the proper one to be used in the ascription of glory, while the
other, “*through* whom,” is specially appropriate in giving of thanks. 
It is also quite untrue to allege that the phrase “*with* whom” is
unfamiliar in the usage of the devout.  All those whose soundness of
character leads them to hold the dignity of antiquity to be more
honourable than mere new-fangled novelty, and who have preserved the
tradition of their fathers <span id="fr_822"></span>[823](#fn_822)
unadulterated, alike in town and in country, have employed this phrase. 
It is, on the contrary, they who are surfeited with the familiar and the
customary, and arrogantly assail the old as stale, who welcome
innovation, just as in dress your lovers of display always prefer some
utter novelty to what is generally worn.  So you may even still see that
the language of country folk preserves the ancient fashion, while of
these, our cunning experts <span id="fr_823"></span>[824](#fn_823) in
logomachy, the language bears the brand of the new philosophy.

<span id="vii.viii-p14"></span>What our fathers said, the same say we,
that the glory of the Father and of the Son is common; wherefore we
offer the doxology to the Father *with* the Son.  But we do not rest
only on the fact that such is the tradition of the Fathers; for they too
followed the sense of Scripture, and started from the evidence which, a
few sentences back, I deduced from Scripture and laid before you.  For
“the brightness” is always thought of <span id="page_11">p. 11</span>
<span id="vii.viii-Page_11"></span>with “the glory,” <span
id="fr_824"></span>[825](#fn_824) “the image” with the archetype, <span
id="fr_825"></span>[826](#fn_825) and the Son always and everywhere
together with the Father; nor does even the close connexion of the
names, much less the nature of the things, admit of separation.

<span id="vii.viii-p4"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p4.1"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p4.2"></span>δελφότης</span> is in the New Testament
peculiar to S. Peter ([1 Pet. 2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017), [1
Pet. 5:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#009)<span

<span id="fn_823"></span>[10:824](2080037.htm#fr_823) <span
id="vii.viii-p12.2"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p13"></span> The verb, <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p13.1"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p13.2"></span>ντρίβομαι</span>, appears to be used by St.
Basil, if he wrote <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p13.3"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p13.4"></span>ντετριμμένων</span> in the sense of to be
<span class="Greek"><span id="vii.viii-p13.5"></span>ἐ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vii.viii-p13.6"></span>ντριβής</span> or versed
in a thing (*cf*. Soph. Ant. 177)—a sense not illustrated by classical
usage.  But the reading of the Moscow <span class="c14"><span
id="vii.viii-p13.7"></span>ms.</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p13.8"></span>(</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p13.9"></span>μ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p13.10"></span>)</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p13.11"></span>ἐ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vii.viii-p13.12"></span>ντεθραμμένων</span>, “trained in,” “nurtured
in,” is *per se* much more probable.  The idea of the country folk
preserving the good old traditions shews the change of circumstances in
St. Basil’s day from those of the 2d c., when the “pagani” or villagers
were mostly still heathen, and the last to adopt the novelty of
Christianity.  *cf*. Pliny’s Letter to Trajan (Ep. 96<span
id="vii.viii-p13.13"></span>), “*neque civitates tantum sed vicos etiam
atque agros superstitionis istius contagio pervagata est*.”

<span id="fn_824"></span>[11:825](2080037.htm#fr_824) <span
id="vii.viii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p15"></span> [Heb. i.
1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001)<span id="vii.viii-p15.1"></span>. 
*cf*. Aug. *Ep*. ii. ad Serap.:  “The Father is Light, and the Son
brightness and true light.”

<span id="fn_825"></span>[11:826](2080037.htm#fr_825) <span
id="vii.viii-p15.2"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p16"></span> [2 Cor. iv.
