<p class="c61"><a name="ix.cclxxviii-p3"></A>To the learned Maximus.</p>  
<p class="c20"><a name="ix.cclxxviii-p4"></A><span class="c14"><a name="ix.cclxxviii-p4.1"></A>The</span> excellent Theotecnus has given mean account of your highness, whereby he has inspired me with a longing for your acquaintance, so clearly do his words delineate the character of your mind.&#160; He has enkindled in me so ardent an affection for you, that were it not that I am weighed down with age, that I am the victim of a congenital ailment, that I am bound hand and foot by the numberless cares of the Church, nothing would have hindered my coming to you.&#160; For indeed it is no small gain that a member of a great house, a man of illustrious lineage, in adopting the life of the gospel, should bridle the propensities of youth by reflection, and subject to reason the affections of the flesh; should display a humility consistent with his Christian profession, bethinking himself, as is his duty, whence he is come and whither he is going.&#160; For it is this consideration of our nature that reduces the swelling of the mind, and banishes all boastfulness and arrogance. &#160;In a word it renders one a disciple of our Lord, Who said, &#8220;Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3233"></A><A HREF="#fn_3233"><FONT SIZE="1">3234</FONT></A>
&#160; And in truth, very dear son, the only thing that deserves our exertions and praises is our everlasting welfare; and this is the honour that comes from God.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cclxxviii-p6"></A>Human affairs are fainter than a shadow; more deceitful than a dream.&#160; Youth fades more quickly than the flowers of spring; our beauty wastes with age or sickness.&#160; Riches are uncertain; glory is fickle.&#160; The pursuit of arts and sciences is bounded by the present life; the charm of eloquence, which all covet, reaches but the ear:&#160; whereas the practice of virtue is a precious possession for its owner, a delightful spectacle for all who witness it.&#160; Make this your study; so will you be worthy of the good things promised by the Lord.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cclxxviii-p7"></A>But a recital of the means whereby to make the acquisition, and secure the enjoyment of these blessings, lies beyond the intention of this present letter.&#160; Thus much however, after what I heard from my brother Theotecnus, it occurred to me to write to you.&#160; I pray that he may always speak the truth, especially in his accounts of you; that the Lord may be the more glorified in you, abounding as you do in the most precious fruits of piety, although derived from a foreign root.</p>
