<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cxxviii-p6"></A>God grant that you may come to see me in my own home, so that I may embrace your reverence and tell you everything in detail.&#160; For we often find some comfort in telling what is painful in actual experience.&#160; However, for all that the very godly bishop has done, fully as far as regards his affection for me, and preeminently and stoutly as regards the exact observance of the canons, commend him.&#160; Moreover, thank God that your pupils everywhere exhibit your reverence&#146;s character.</p>
