<p class="c53"><a name="vii.xi-p1"></A>  <span class="c1"><a name="vii.xi-p1.1"></A>Chapter X.</span></p>  
<p class="c54"><a name="vii.xi-p2"></A>Against those who say that it is not right to rank the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son.</p>  
<p class="c20"><a name="vii.xi-p3"></A>24.&#160; <span class="c14"><a name="vii.xi-p3.1"></A>But</span> we must proceed to attack our opponents, in the endeavour to confute those &#8220;oppositions&#8221; advanced against us which are derived from &#8220;knowledge falsely so-called.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_923"></A><A HREF="#fn_923"><FONT SIZE="1">924</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xi-p5"></A>It is not permissible, they assert, for the Holy Spirit to be ranked with the Father and Son, on account of the difference of His nature and the inferiority of His dignity.&#160; Against them it is right to reply in the words of the apostles, &#8220;We ought to obey God rather than men.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_924"></A><A HREF="#fn_924"><FONT SIZE="1">925</FONT></A>
</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xi-p7"></A>For if our Lord, when enjoining the baptism of salvation, charged His disciples to baptize all nations in the name &#8220;of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_925"></A><A HREF="#fn_925"><FONT SIZE="1">926</FONT></A>
 not disdaining fellowship with Him, and these men allege that we must not rank Him with the Father and the Son, is it not clear that they openly withstand the commandment of God?&#160; If they deny that coordination of this kind is declaratory of any fellowship and conjunction, let them tell us why it behoves us to hold this opinion, and what more intimate mode of conjunction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_926"></A><A HREF="#fn_926"><FONT SIZE="1">927</FONT></A>
 they have.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xi-p10"></A>If the Lord did not indeed conjoin the Spirit with the Father and Himself in baptism, do not&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_927"></A><A HREF="#fn_927"><FONT SIZE="1">928</FONT></A>
 let them lay the blame of conjunction upon us, for we neither hold nor say anything different.&#160; If on the contrary the Spirit is there conjoined with the Father and the Son, and no one is so shameless as to say anything else, then let them not lay blame on us for following the words of Scripture.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xi-p12"></A>25.&#160; But all the apparatus of war has been got ready against us; every intellectual missile is aimed at us; and now blasphemers&#146; tongues shoot and hit and hit again, yet harder than Stephen of old was smitten by the killers of the Christ.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_928"><FONT SIZE="1">929</FONT></A>
&#160; And do not let them succeed in concealing the fact that, while an attack on us serves for a pretext for the war, the real aim of these proceedings is higher.&#160; It is against us, they say, that they are preparing their engines and their snares; against us that they are shouting to one another, according to each one&#146;s strength or cunning, to come on.&#160; But the object of attack is faith.&#160; The one aim of the whole band of opponents and enemies of &#8220;sound doctrine&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_929"><FONT SIZE="1">930</FONT></A>
 is to shake down the foundation of the faith of Christ by levelling apostolic tradition with the ground, and utterly destroying it.&#160; So like the debtors,&#8212;of course <i>bona fide</i> debtors&#8212;they clamour for written proof, and reject as worthless the unwritten tradition of the Fathers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">931</FONT></A>
&#160; But we will not slacken in our de<A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A> <a name="vii.xi-Page_17"></A>fence of the truth.&#160; We will not cowardly abandon the cause.&#160; The Lord has delivered to us as a necessary and saving doctrine that the Holy Spirit is to be ranked with the Father.&#160; Our opponents think differently, and see fit to divide and rend&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_931"><FONT SIZE="1">932</FONT></A>
 asunder, and relegate Him to the nature of a ministering spirit.&#160; Is it not then indisputable that they make their own blasphemy more authoritative than the law prescribed by the Lord?&#160; Come, then, set aside mere contention.&#160; Let us consider the points before us, as follows:</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.xi-p17"></A>26.&#160; Whence is it that we are Christians?&#160; Through our faith, would be the universal answer.&#160; And in what way are we saved?&#160; Plainly because we were regenerate through the grace given in our baptism.&#160; How else could we be?&#160; And after recognising that this salvation is established through the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, shall we fling away &#8220;that form of doctrine&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="#fn_932"><FONT SIZE="1">933</FONT></A>
 which we received?&#160; Would it not rather be ground for great groaning if we are found now further off from our salvation &#8220;than when we first believed,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="#fn_933"><FONT SIZE="1">934</FONT></A>
 and deny now what we then received?&#160; Whether a man have departed this life without baptism, or have received a baptism lacking in some of the requirements of the tradition, his loss is equal.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_934"></A><A HREF="#fn_934"><FONT SIZE="1">935</FONT></A>
&#160; And whoever does not always and everywhere keep to and hold fast as a sure protection the confession which we recorded at our first admission, when, being delivered &#8220;from the idols,&#8221; we came &#8220;to the living God,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_935"></A><A HREF="#fn_935"><FONT SIZE="1">936</FONT></A>
 constitutes himself a &#8220;stranger&#8221; from the &#8220;promises&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_936"></A><A HREF="#fn_936"><FONT SIZE="1">937</FONT></A>
 of God, fighting against his own handwriting,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_937"></A><A HREF="#fn_937"><FONT SIZE="1">938</FONT></A>
 which he put on record when he professed the faith.&#160; For if to me my baptism was the beginning of life, and that day of regeneration the first of days, it is plain that the utterance uttered in the grace of adoption was the most honourable of all.&#160; Can I then, perverted by these men&#146;s seductive words, abandon the tradition which guided me to the light, which bestowed on me the boon of the knowledge of God, whereby I, so long a foe by reason of sin, was made a child of God?&#160; But, for myself, I pray that with this confession I may depart hence to the Lord, and them I charge to preserve the faith secure until the day of Christ, and to keep the Spirit undivided from the Father and the Son, preserving, both in the confession of faith and in the doxology, the doctrine taught them at their baptism.</p>

Schaff&#146;s <i>Hist. of Christian Ch.</i> III. Period, Sec. 128.&#160; In Letter cxxv. of St. Basil will be found a summary of the heresies with which he credited the Arians, submitted to Eusthathius of Sebaste in 373, shortly before the composition of the present treatise for Amphilochius.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="vii.xi-p20"></A> The question is whether the baptism has been solemnized, according to the divine command, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.&#160; St. Cyprian in his controversy with Stephen, Bp. of Rome, represented the sterner view that heretical baptism was invalid.&#160; But, with some exceptions in the East, the position ultimately prevailed that baptism with water, and <i>in the prescribed words</i>, by whomsoever administered, was valid.&#160; So St. Augustine, &#8220;<i>Si evangelicus verbis in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti Marcion baptismum consecrabat, integrum erat Sacramentum, quamvis ejus fides sub eisdem verbis aliud opinantis quam catholica veritas docet non esset integra</i>.&#8221;&#160; (<i>Cont. Petil. de unico bapt</i>. &sect; 3.)&#160; So the <i>VIII. Canon of Arles</i> (314), &#8220;<i>De Afris, quod propria lege sua utuntur ut rebaptizent, placuit, ut, si ad ecclesiam aliquis de h&aelig;resi venerit, interrogent eum symbolum; et si perviderint eum in Patre, et Filio et Spiritu Sancto, esse baptizatum, manus ei tantum imponantur, ut accipiat spiritum sanctum.&#160; Quod si interrogatus non responderit hanc Trinitatem, baptizetur</i>.&#8221;&#160; So the VII. Canon of Constantinople (381) by which the Eunomians who only baptized with one immersion, and the Montanists, here called Phrygians, and the Sabellians, who taught the doctrine of the Fatherhood of the Son, were counted as heathen.&#160; <i>Vide</i> Bright&#146;s notes on the <i>Canons of the Councils</i>, p. 106.&#160; Socrates, v. 24, describes how the Eunomi-Eutychians baptized not in the name of the Trinity, but into the death of Christ.</p>
