<span id="ix.xxii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xxii-p1.1"></span>Letter XXI. <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911) </span>

<span id="ix.xxii-p3"></span>*To Leontius the Sophist*.

<span id="ix.xxii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxii-p4.1"></span>The</span> excellent Julianus <span
id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912) seems to get some good for his
private affairs out of the general condition of things.  Everything
nowadays is full of taxes demanded and called in, and he too is
vehemently dunned and indicted.  Only it is a question not of arrears of
rates and taxes, but of letters.  But how he comes to be a defaulter I
do not know.  He has always paid a letter, and received a letter—as he
has this.  But possibly you have a preference for the famous
“four-times-as-much.” <span id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913)  For
even the Pythagoreans were not so fond of their Tetractys, <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914) as these modern tax-collectors of
their “four-times-as-much.”  Yet perhaps the fairer thing would have
been just the opposite, that a Sophist like you, so very well furnished
with words, should be bound in pledge to me for “four-times-as-much.” 
But do not suppose for a moment that I am writing all this out of
ill-humour.  I am only too pleased to get even a scolding from you.  The
good and beautiful do everything, it is said, with the addition of
goodness and beauty. <span id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915)   Even
grief and anger in them are becoming.  At all events any one would
rather see his friend angry with him than any one else flattering him. 
Do not then cease preferring charges like the last!  The very charge
will mean a letter; and nothing can be more precious or delightful to
me.

<span id="ix.xxii-p6"></span> The Ben. note quotes Ammianus Marcellinus
xxvi. 6, where it is said of Petronius, father-in-law of Valens:  “*ad
nudandos sine discretione cunctos immaniter flagrans nocentes pariter et
insontes post exquisita tormenta quadrupli nexibus vinciebat, debita jam
inde a temporibus principio Aureliani perscrutans, et impendio mærens si
quemquam absolvisset indemnem*;” and adds:  “*Est ergo quadruplum hoc
loco non quadrimenstrua pensio, non superexactio, sed debitorum, quæ
soluta non fuerant, crudelis inquisitio et quadrupli pœna his qui non
solverant imposita*.”

<span id="ix.xxii-p7"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxii-p7.1"></span>τετρακτύς</span> was the Pythagorean name for
the sum of the first four numbers (1+2+3+4=10), held by them to be the
root of all creation.  *cf*. the Pythagorean oath:

<span id="ix.xxii-p8"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxii-p8.1"></span>Ναὶ μὰ τὸν ἁμετέρᾳ ψύχᾳ παραδόντα
τετρακτύν,</span>

<span id="ix.xxii-p9"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxii-p9.1"></span>Παγὰν ἀενάου φύσεως ῥιζώματ᾽ ἔχουσαν</span>

<span id="ix.xxii-p10"></span>*cf*. my note on Theodoret, *Ep*. cxxx.
for the use of <span class="Greek"><span

<span id="ix.xxii-p11"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxii-p11.1"></span>Τοῖς καλοῖς πάντα μετὰ τῆς τοῦ καλοῦ προσθήκης
γίνεσθαι</span>.  The pregnant sense of <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xxii-p11.2"></span>καλός</span> makes translation difficult.
