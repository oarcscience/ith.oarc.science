<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.xvii-p6"></A> As an argument against Eunomius this Letter has no particular force, inasmuch as a man may be a good divine though a very poor entomologist, and might tell us all about the ant without being better able to decide between Basil and Eunomius.&#160; It is interesting, however, as shewing how far Basil was abreast of the physiology of his time, and how far that physiology was correct.</p>
