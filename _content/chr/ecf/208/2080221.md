<span id="ix.cxlix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cxlix-p1.1"></span>Letter CXLVIII. <span
id="fr_2485"></span>[2486](#fn_2485) </span>

<span id="ix.cxlix-p3"></span>*To Trajan*. <span

<span id="ix.cxlix-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxlix-p5.1"></span>Even</span> the ability to bewail their own
calamities brings much comfort to the distressed; and this is specially
the case when they meet with others capable, from their lofty character,
of sympathizing with their sorrows.  So my right honourable brother
Maximus, after being prefect of my country, and then suffering what no
other man ever yet suffered, stripped of all his belongings both
inherited from his forefathers and collected by his own labours,
afflicted in body in many and various ways, by his wanderings up and
down the world, and not having been able to keep even his civil status
free from attack, to preserve which freemen are wont to leave no labour
undone, has made many complaints to me about all that has happened to
him, and has begged me to give you a short description of the Iliad of
woes in which he is involved.  <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> <span
id="ix.cxlix-Page_207"></span>And I, being quite unable to relieve him
in any other way in his troubles, have readily done him the favour
shortly to relate to your excellency a part of what I have heard from
him.  He, indeed, seemed to me to blush at the idea of making a plain
tale of his own calamity.  If what has happened shews that the inflicter
of the wrong is a villain, at all events it proves the sufferer to be
deserving of great pity; since the very fact of having fallen into
troubles inflicted by Divine Providence, seems in a manner to shew that
a man has been devoted to suffering.  But it would be a sufficient
comfort to him if you will only look at him kindly, and extend also to
him that abundant favour which all the recipients of it cannot
exhaust,—I mean your clemency.  We are all of us convinced that before
the tribunal your protection will be an immense step towards victory. 
He who has asked for my letter as likely to be of service is of all men
most upright.  May it be granted me to see him, with the rest,
proclaiming aloud the praises of your lordship with all his power.
