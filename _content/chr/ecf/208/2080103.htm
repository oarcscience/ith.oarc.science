 the only comfort I had in life.&#160; Do not smile, if, old as I am, I lament my orphanhood.&#160; Forgive me if I cannot endure separation from a soul, to compare with whom I see nothing in the future that lies before me.&#160; So once more my complaints have come back to me; once more I am confined to my bed, tossing about in my weakness, and every hour all but looking for the end of life; and the Churches are in somewhat the same condition as my body, no good hope shining on them, and their state always changing for the worse.&#160; In the meantime Neoc&aelig;sarea and Ancyra have decided to have successors of the dead, and so far they are at peace.&#160; Those who are plotting against me have not yet been permitted to do anything worthy of their bitterness and wrath.&#160; This we make no secret of attributing to your prayers on behalf of the Churches.&#160; Weary not then in praying for the Churches and in entreating God.&#160; Pray give all salutations to those who are privileged to minister to your Holiness.</p>
