<p class="c20"><a name="ix.clii-p5"></A><span class="c14"><a name="ix.clii-p5.1"></A>If</span> my letters are of any good, lose no time in writing to me and in rousing me to write.&#160; We are unquestionably made more cheerful when we read the letters of wise men who love the Lord.&#160; It is for you to say, who read it, whether you find anything worth attention in what I write.&#160; Were it not for the multitude of my engagements, I should not debar myself from the pleasure of writing frequently.&#160; Pray do you, whose cares are fewer, soothe me by your letters.&#160; Wells, it is said, are the better for being used.&#160; The exhortations which you derive from your profession are apparently beside the point, for it is not I who am applying the knife; it is men whose day is done, who are falling upon themselves.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2500"></A><A HREF="#fn_2500"><FONT SIZE="1">2501</FONT></A>
&#160; The phrase of the Stoics runs, &#8220;since things do not happen as we like, we like what happens;&#8221; but I cannot make my mind fall in with what is happening.&#160; That some men should do what they do not like because they cannot help it, I have no objection.&#160; You doctors do not cauterise a sick man, or make him suffer pain in some other way, because you like it; but you often adopt this treatment in obedience to the necessity of the case.&#160; Mariners do not willingly throw their cargo overboard; but in order to escape shipwreck they put up with the loss, preferring a life of penury to death.&#160; Be sure that I look with sorrow and with many groans upon the separation of those who are holding themselves aloof.&#160; But yet I endure it.&#160; To lovers of the truth nothing can be put before God and hope in Him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2501"></A><A HREF="#fn_2501"><FONT SIZE="1">2502</FONT></A>
