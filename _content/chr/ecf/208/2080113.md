<span id="ix.xli-p3"></span>*Julian to Basil*.

<span id="ix.xli-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xli-p4.1"></span>While</span> showing up to the present time the
gentleness and benevolence which have been natural to me from my
boyhood, I have reduced all who dwell beneath the sun to obedience.  For
lo! every tribe of barbarians to the shores of ocean has come to lay its
gifts before my feet.  So too the Sagadares who dwell beyond the Danube,
wondrous with their bright tattooing, and hardly like human beings, so
wild and strange are they, now grovel at my feet, and pledge themselves
to obey all the behests my sovereignty imposes on them.  I have a
further object.  I must as soon as possible march to Persia and rout and
make a tributary of that Sapor, descendant of Darius.  I mean too to
devastate the country of the Indians and the Saracens until they all
acknowledge my superiority and become my tributaries.  You, however,
profess a wisdom above and beyond these things; you call yourself clad
with piety, but your clothing is really impudence and everywhere you
slander me as one unworthy of the imperial dignity.  Do you not know
that I am the grandson of the illustrious Constantius? <span
id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053)   I know this of you, and yet I do
not change the old feelings which I had to you, and you to me in the
days when we were both young. <span id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054)
  But of my merciful will I command that a thousand pounds of gold be
sent me from you, when I pass by Cæsarea; for I am still on the march,
and with all possible dispatch am hurrying to the Persian campaign.  If
you refuse I am prepared to destroy Cæsarea, to overthrow the buildings
that have long adorned it; to erect in their place temples and statues;
and so to induce all men to submit to the Emperor of the Romans and not
exalt themselves.  Wherefore I charge you to send me without fail by the
hands of some trusty messenger the stipulated gold, after duly counting
and weighing it, and sealing it with your ring.  In this way I may show
mercy to you for your errors, if you acknowledge, however late, that no
excuses will avail.  I have learned to know, and to condemn, what once I
read. <span id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055)

id="ix.xli-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p2"></span> If genuine, which is exceedingly doubtful,
this letter would be placed in the June or July of 362.

<span id="fn_2053"></span>[142:2054](2080113.htm#fr_2053) <span
id="ix.xli-p4.2"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p5"></span> *i.e.* of Constantius Chlorus.  *Vide*
pedigree prefixed to Theodoret in this edition, p. 32.  Julian was the
youngest son of Julius Constantius, half-brother of Constantine the
Great.

<span id="fn_2054"></span>[142:2055](2080113.htm#fr_2054) <span
id="ix.xli-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p6"></span> The fact of the early acquaintance of Basil
and Julian does not rest wholly on the authority of this doubtful
letter.  *cf*. Greg. Naz., *Orat*. iv.

<span id="fn_2055"></span>[142:2056](2080113.htm#fr_2055) <span
id="ix.xli-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xli-p7"></span> A strong argument against the genuineness
of this letter is the silence of Gregory of Nazianzus as to this demand
on Basil (*Or*. v. 39).  For Julian’s treatment of Cæsarea, *vide*
Sozomen v. 4.  Maran (*Vita S. Bas*. viii.) remarks that when Julian
approached Cæsarea Basil was in his Pontic retreat.  On the punning
conclusion, *vide* note on *Letter* xli.  (<span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xli-p7.1"></span>ἃ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.xli-p7.2"></span>ἀνέγνων ἔγνων καὶ κατέγνων</span>.)
