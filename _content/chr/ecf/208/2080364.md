<span id="ix.ccxcii"></span>

<span id="ix.ccxcii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxcii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXCI. <span
id="fr_3254"></span>[3255](#fn_3254) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxcii-p3"></span>*To Timotheus the Chorepiscopus*. <span
id="fr_3255"></span>[3256](#fn_3255)

<span id="ix.ccxcii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxcii-p5.1"></span>The</span> due limits of a letter, and that
mode of addressing you, render it inconvenient for me to write all I
think; at the same time to pass over my thoughts in silence, when my
heart is burning with righteous indignation against you, is well-nigh
impossible.  I will adopt the midway course:  I will write some things;
others I will omit.  For I wish to chide you, if so I may, in terms both
flank and friendly.

<span id="ix.ccxcii-p6"></span>Yes! that Timotheus whom I have known
from boyhood, so intent upon an upright and ascetic life, as even to be
accused of excess therein, now forsakes the enquiry after those means
whereby we may be united to God; now makes it his first thought what
some one else may think of him, and lives a life of dependence upon the
opinions of others; is mainly anxious how to serve his friends, without
incurring the ridicule of enemies; and fears disgrace with the world as
a great misfortune.  Does he not know, that while he is occupied with
these trifles he is unconsciously neglecting his highest interests? 
For, that we cannot be engaged with both at once—the things of this
world and of Heaven—the holy Scriptures are full of teaching for us. 
Nay, Nature herself is full of such instances.  In the exercise of the
mental faculty, to think two thoughts at the same time is quite
impossible.  In the perceptions of our senses, to admit two sounds
falling upon our ears at the same moment, and to distinguish them,
although we are provided with two open passages, is impossible.  Our
eyes, again, unless they are both fixed upon the object of our vision,
are unable to perform their action accurately.

<span id="ix.ccxcii-p7"></span>Thus much for Nature; but to recite to
you the evidence of the Scriptures were as <span id="page_316">p.
316</span> <span id="ix.ccxcii-Page_316"></span>ridiculous as, so runs
the proverb, ‘to carry owls to Athens.’ <span
id="fr_3256"></span>[3257](#fn_3256)   Why then combine things
incompatible—the tumults of civil life and the practice of religion?

<span id="ix.ccxcii-p9"></span>Withdraw from clamour; be no more the
cause or object of annoyance; let us keep ourselves to ourselves.  We
long since proposed religion as our aim; let us make the attainment of
it our practice, and shew those who have the wish to insult us that it
does not lie with them to annoy us at their will.  But this will only be
when we have clearly shewn them that we afford no handle for abuse.

<span id="ix.ccxcii-p10"></span>For the present enough of this!  Would
that some day we might meet and more perfectly consider those things
that be for our souls’ welfare; so may we not be too much occupied with
thoughts of vanity, since death must one day overtake us.

<span id="ix.ccxcii-p11"></span>I was greatly pleased with the gifts you
kindly sent me.  They were most welcome on their own account; the
thought of who it was that sent them made them many times more welcome. 
The gifts from Pontus, the tablets and medicines, kindly accept when I
send them.  At present they are not by me.

<span id="ix.ccxcii-p12"></span>N.B.  The letters numbered
CCXCII.–CCCLXVI. are included by the Ben. Ed. in a “Classis Tertia,”
having no note of time.  Some are doubtful, and some plainly spurious. 
Of these I include such as seem most important.
