<span id="ix.ccxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXIII. <span
id="fr_2803"></span>[2804](#fn_2803) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxiv-p3"></span>*Without address*.

<span id="ix.ccxiv-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxiv-p4.1"></span>May</span> the Lord, Who has brought me prompt
help in my afflictions, grant you the help of the refreshment wherewith
you have refreshed me by writing to me, rewarding you for your
consolation of my humble self with the real and great gladness of the
Spirit.  For I was indeed downcast in soul when I saw in a great
multitude the almost brutish and unreasonable insensibility of the
people, and the inveterate and ineradicable unsatisfactoriness of their
leaders.  But I saw your letter; I saw the treasure of love which it
contained; then I knew that He Who ordains all our lives had made some
sweet consolation shine on me in the bitterness of <span
id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span id="ix.ccxiv-Page_253"></span>my
life.  I therefore salute your holiness in return, and exhort you, as is
my wont, not to cease to pray for my unhappy life, that I may never,
drowned in the unrealities of this world, forget God, “who raiseth up
the poor out of the dust;” <span id="fr_2804"></span>[2805](#fn_2804)
that I may never be lifted up with pride and fall into the condemnation
of the devil; <span id="fr_2805"></span>[2806](#fn_2805) that I may
never be found by the Lord neglectful of my stewardship and asleep;
never discharging it amiss, and wounding the conscience of my
fellow-servants; <span id="fr_2806"></span>[2807](#fn_2806) and, never
companying with the drunken, suffer the pains threatened in God’s just
judgment against wicked stewards.  I beseech you, therefore, in all your
prayers to pray God that I may be watchful in all things; that I may be
no shame or disgrace to the name of Christ, in the revelation of the
secrets of my heart, in the great day of the appearing of our Saviour
Jesus Christ.

<span id="ix.ccxiv-p8"></span>2.  Know then that I am expecting to be
summoned by the wickedness of the heretics to the court, in the name of
peace.  Learn too that on being so informed, this bishop <span
id="fr_2807"></span>[2808](#fn_2807) wrote to me to hasten to
Mesopotamia, and, after assembling together those who in that country
are of like sentiments with us, and are strengthening the state of the
Church, to travel in their company to the emperor.  But perhaps my
health will not be good enough to allow me to undertake a journey in the
winter.  Indeed, hitherto I have not thought the matter pressing, unless
you advise it.  I shall therefore await your counsel that my mind may be
made up.  Lose no time then, I beg you, in making known to me, by means
of one of our trusty brethren, what course seems best to the divinely
guided intelligence of your excellency.

letter to the year 373.
