id="ix.cclxxvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXV. <span
id="fr_3230"></span>[3231](#fn_3230) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxvi-p3"></span>Without address.  Concerning Hera.

<span id="ix.cclxxvi-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxvi-p4.1"></span>You</span> have anticipated my entreaties in
your affection for my very reverend brother Hera, and you have been
better to him than I could have prayed for you to be in the abundant
honour which you have shewn him, and the protection which you have
extended to him on every occasion.  But I cannot allow his affairs to go
unnoticed by a word, and I must beseech your excellency that for my sake
you will add something to the interest you have shewn in him, and will
send him back to his own country victorious over the revilings of his
enemies.  Now many are trying to insult the peacefulness of his life,
and he is not beyond the reach of envy’s shafts.  Against his foes we
shall find one sure means of safety, if you will consent to extend your
protection over him.
