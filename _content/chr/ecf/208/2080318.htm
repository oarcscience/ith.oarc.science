<p class="c20"><a name="ix.ccxlvi-p5"></A><span class="c14"><a name="ix.ccxlvi-p5.1"></A>It</span> is some time since I received your letter, but I waited to be able to reply by some fit person; that so the bearer of my answer might supply whatever might be wanting in it.&#160; Now there has arrived our much beloved and very reverend brother Strategius, and I have judged it well to make use of his services, both as knowing my mind and able to convey&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3082"></A><A HREF="#fn_3082"><FONT SIZE="1">3083</FONT></A>
 news of me with due propriety and reverence.&#160; Know, therefore, my beloved and honoured friend, that I highly value my affection for you, and am not conscious so far as the disposition of my heart goes, of having at any time failed in it, although I have had many serious causes of reasonable complaint.&#160; But I have decided to weigh the good against the bad, as in a balance, and to add my own mind where the better inclines.&#160; Now changes have been made by those who should least of all have allowed anything of the kind.&#160; Pardon me, therefore, for I have not changed my mind, if I have shifted any side, or rather I should say, I shall still be on the same side, but there are others who are continually changing it, and are now openly deserting to the foe.&#160; You yourself know what a value I put on their communion, so long as they were of the sound party.&#160; If now I refuse to follow these, and shun all who think with them, I ought fairly to be forgiven.&#160; I put truth and my own salvation before everything.</p>
