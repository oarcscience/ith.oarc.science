<span id="ix.xciv-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xciv-p1.1"></span>Letter XCIII. <span
id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327) </span>

<span id="ix.xciv-p3"></span>*To the Patrician Cæsaria*, <span
id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328) *concerning Communion*.

<span id="ix.xciv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xciv-p5.1"></span>It</span> is good and beneficial to communicate
every day, and to partake of the holy body and blood of Christ.  For He
distinctly says, “He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath
eternal life.” <span id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329)   And who
doubts that to share frequently in life, is the same thing as to have
manifold life.  I, indeed, communicate four times a week, on the Lord’s
day, on Wednesday, on Friday, and on the Sabbath, and on the other days
if there is a commemoration of any Saint. <span
id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330)   It is needless to point out that
for anyone in times of persecution to be compelled to take the communion
in his own hand without the presence of a priest or minister is not a
serious offence, as long custom sanctions this practice from the facts
themselves.  All the solitaries in the desert, where there is no priest,
take the communion themselves, keeping communion at home.  And at
Alexandria and in Egypt, each one of the laity, for the most part, keeps
the communion, at his own house, and participates in it when he likes. 
For when once the priest has completed the offering, and given it, the
recipient, participating in it each time as entire, is bound to believe
that he properly takes and receives it from the giver.  And even in the
church, when the priest gives the portion, the recipient takes it with
complete power over it, and so lifts it to his lips with his own hand. 
It has the same validity whether one portion or several portions are
received from the priest at the same time. <span

<span id="ix.xciv-p7"></span> A various reading is “martyr.”  In
*Letter* cxcvii. to S. Ambrose, S. Basil, states that the same honour
was paid to S. Dionysius of Milan in his place of sepulture as to a
martyr.  So Gregory Thaumaturgus was honoured at Neocæsarea, and
Athanasius and Basil received like distinction soon after their death.

<span id="ix.xciv-p8"></span> The custom of the reservation of the
Sacrament is, as is well known, of great antiquity.  *cf*. Justin
Martyr, *Apol*. i. 85; Tertull., *De Orat*. xix. and *Ad Ux*. ii. 5; S.
Cyprian, *De Lapsis* cxxxii.; Jerome, *Ep*. cxxv.  Abuses of the
practice soon led to prohibition.  So an Armenian Canon of the fourth
century (*Canones Isaaci, in Mai, Script. Vet. Nov. Coll*. x. 280) and
the Council of Saragossa, 380; though in these cases there seems an idea
of surreptitious reservation.  On the doctrine of the English Church on
this subject reference may be made to the Report of a Committee of the
Upper House of the Convocation of Canterbury in 1885.

<span id="ix.xciv-p9"></span>The Rubric of 1549 allowed reservation, and
it does not seem to have been prohibited until 1661.  Bishop A. P.
Forbes on Article xxviii. points out that in the Article reservation is
not forbidden, but declared not to be of Christ’s institution, and
consequently not binding on the Church.  The distinction will not be
forgotten between reservation and worship of the reserved Sacrament.
