<p class="c20"><a name="ix.lvii-p5"></A>I <span class="c14"><a name="ix.lvii-p5.1"></A>naturally</span> forget very easily, and I have had lately many things to do, and so my natural infirmity is increased.&#160; I have no doubt, therefore, that you have written to me, although I have no recollection of having received any letter from your excellency; for I am sure you would not state what is not the case.&#160; But for there having been no reply, it is not I that am in fault; the guilt lies with him who did not ask for one.&#160; Now, however, you have this letter, containing my defence for the past and affording ground for a second greeting.&#160; So, when you write to me, do not suppose that you are taking the initiative in another correspondence.&#160; You are only discharging your proper obligation in this.&#160; For really, although this letter of mine is a return for a previous one of yours, as it is more than twice as bulky, it will fulfil a double purpose.&#160; You see to what sophisms my idleness drives me.&#160; But, my dear Sir, do not in a few words bring serious charges, indeed the most serious of all.&#160; Forgetfulness of one&#146;s friends, and neglect of them arising from high place, are faults which involve every kind of wrong.&#160; Do we fail to love <A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A> <a name="ix.lvii-Page_159"></A>according to the commandment of the Lord?&#160; Then we lose the distinctive mark imprinted on us.&#160; Are we puffed to repletion with empty pride and arrogance?&#160; Then we fall into the inevitable condemnation of the devil.&#160; If, then, you use these words because you held such sentiments about me, pray that I may flee from the wickedness which you have found in my ways; if, however, your tongue shaped itself to these words, in a kind of inconsiderate conventionality, I shall console myself, and ask you to be good enough to adduce some tangible proof of your allegations.&#160; Be well assured of this, that my present anxiety is an occasion to me of humility.&#160; I shall begin to forget you, when I cease to know myself.&#160; Never, then, think that because a man is a very busy man he is a man of faulty character.</p>
