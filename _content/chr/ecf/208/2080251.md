<span id="ix.clxxix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clxxix-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXXVIII. <span
id="fr_2586"></span>[2587](#fn_2586) </span>

<span id="ix.clxxix-p3"></span>*To Aburgius*. <span
id="fr_2587"></span>[2588](#fn_2587)

<span id="ix.clxxix-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxix-p5.1"></span>know</span> that I have often recommended
many persons to your excellency, and so in serious emergencies have been
very useful to friends in distress.  But I do not think that I have ever
sent to you one whom I regard with greater respect, or one engaged in
contests of greater importance, than my very dear son Eusebius, who now
places this letter in your hands.  He will himself inform your
excellency, if the opportunity is permitted him, in what difficulties he
is involved.  I ought to say, at least, as much as this.  The man ought
not to be misjudged, nor, because many have been convicted of
disgraceful doings, ought he to come under common suspicion.  He ought
to have a fair trial, and his life must be enquired into.  In this way
the untruth of the charges against him will be made plain, and he, after
enjoying your righteous protection, will ever proclaim what he owes to
your kindness. <span id="fr_2588"></span>[2589](#fn_2588)

throne.  *cf*. Ammianus Marcellinus xxix. 1, 2.
