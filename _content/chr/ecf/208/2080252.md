<span id="ix.clxxx-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxx-p5.1"></span>Your</span> natural nobility of character and
your general accessibility have taught me to regard you as a friend of
freedom and of men.  I have, therefore, no hesitation in approaching you
in behalf of one who is rendered illustrious by a long line of ancestry,
but is worthy of greater esteem and honour on his own account, because
of his innate goodness of disposition.  I beg you, on my entreaty, to
give him your support under a legal charge, in reality, indeed,
ridiculous, but difficult to meet on account of the seriousness of the
accusation.  It would be of great importance to his success if you would
deign to say a kind word in his behalf.  You would, in the first place,
be helping the right; but you would further be showing in this your
wonted respect and kindness to myself, who am your friend.
