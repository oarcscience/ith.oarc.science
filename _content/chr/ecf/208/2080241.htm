&#160; But I have so much the more ground for congratulating you on being worthy of the privilege of enjoying, at such a moment, the society of one who is fighting such a good fight in the cause of the truth, and I am sure that you, who nobly support and stimulate his zeal, will be thought worthy by the Lord of a lot like his.&#160; What a blessing, to enjoy in unbroken quiet the society of the man so rich in learning and experienced in life!&#160; Now, at least, you must, I am sure, know how wise he is.&#160; In days gone by his mind was necessarily given to many divided cares, and you were too busy a man to give your sole heed to the spiritual fountain which springs from his pure heart.&#160; God grant that you may be a comfort to him, and never yourself want consolation from others.&#160; I am sure of the disposition of your heart, alike from the experience which I, for a short time, have had of you, and from the exalted teaching your illustrious instructor, with whom to pass one single day is a sufficient provision for the journey to salvation.</p>
