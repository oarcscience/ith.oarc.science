id="ix.cclxxxvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXXVI. <span
id="fr_3244"></span>[3245](#fn_3244) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxxvii-p3"></span>*To the Commentariensis*. <span

<span id="ix.cclxxxvii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxxvii-p5.1"></span>Whereas</span> certain vagabonds have been
arrested in the church for stealing, in defiance of God’s commandment,
some poor men’s clothing, of little value otherwise, yet such as they
had rather have on than off their backs; and whereas you consider that
in virtue of your office you yourself should have the custody of the
offenders:—I hereby declare, that I would have you know that for
offences committed in the church it is our business to mete out
punishment, and that the intervention of the civil authorities is in
these cases superfluous.  Wherefore, the stolen property, as set forth
in the document in your possession and in the transcript made in the
presence of eyewitnesses, I enjoin you to retain, reserving part for
future claims, and distributing the rest among the present applicants.

<span id="ix.cclxxxvii-p6"></span>As for the offenders,—that they be
corrected in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.  By this means I
hope to work their successive reformations.  For where the stripes of
human tribunals have failed, I have often known the fearful judgments of
God to be effectual.  If it is, however, your wish to refer this matter
also to the count, such is my confidence in his justice and uprightness
that I leave you to follow your own counsels.
