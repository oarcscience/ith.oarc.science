<span id="vii.xx-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX.</span>

<span id="vii.xx-p2"></span>Against those who assert that the Spirit
ought not to be glorified.

<span id="vii.xx-p3"></span>48.  “<span class="c14"><span
id="vii.xx-p3.1"></span>Be</span> it so,” it is rejoined, “but glory is
by no means so absolutely due to the Spirit as to require His exaltation
by us in doxologies.”  Whence then could we get demonstrations of the
dignity of the Spirit, “passing all understanding,” <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[1114](#fn_1113) if His communion with the Father
and the Son were not reckoned by our opponents as good for testimony of
His rank?  It is, at all events, possible for us to arrive to a certain
extent at intelligent apprehension of the sublimity of His nature and of
His unapproachable power, by looking at the meaning of His title, and at
the magnitude of His operations, and by His good gifts bestowed on us or
rather on all creation.  He is called Spirit, as “God is a
Spirit,” <span id="fr_1114"></span>[1115](#fn_1114) and “the breath of
our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[1116](#fn_1115)   He is called holy, <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[1117](#fn_1116) as the Father is holy, and the Son
is holy, for to the creature holiness was brought in from without, but
to the Spirit holiness is the fulfilment of nature, and it is for this
reason that He is described not as being sanctified, but as
sanctifying.  He is called good, <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1118](#fn_1117) as the Father is good, and He who
was begotten of the Good is good, and to the Spirit His goodness is
essence.  He is called upright, <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1119](#fn_1118) as “the Lord is upright,” <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[1120](#fn_1119) in that He is Himself truth, <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[1121](#fn_1120) and is Himself Righteousness, <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[1122](#fn_1121) having no divergence nor leaning to
one side or to the other, on account of the immutability of His
substance.  He is called Paraclete, like the Only begotten, as He
Himself says, “I will ask the Father, and He will give you another
comforter.” <span id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122)   Thus names are
borne by the Spirit in common with the Father and the Son, and He gets
these titles from His natural and close relationship.  From what other
source could they be derived?  Again He is called royal, <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123) Spirit of truth, <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[1125](#fn_1124) and Spirit of wisdom. <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1126](#fn_1125)   “The Spirit of God,” it is said
“hath made me,” <span id="fr_1126"></span>[1127](#fn_1126) and God
filled Bezaleel with “the divine Spirit of wisdom and understanding and
knowledge.” <span id="fr_1127"></span>[1128](#fn_1127)   Such names as
these are super-eminent and mighty, but they do not transcend His glory.

<span id="vii.xx-p19"></span>49.  And His operations, what are they? 
For majesty ineffable, and for numbers innumerable.  How shall we form a
conception of what extends beyond the ages?  What were His operations
before that creation whereof we can conceive?  How great the grace which
He conferred on creation?  What the power exercised by Him over the ages
to come?  He existed; He pre-existed; He co-existed with the Father and
the Son before the ages.  It follows that, even if you can conceive of
anything beyond the ages, you will find the Spirit yet further above and
beyond.  And if you think of the creation, the powers of the heavens
were estab<span id="page_31">p. 31</span> <span
id="vii.xx-Page_31"></span>lished by the Spirit, <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1129](#fn_1128) the establishment being understood
to refer to disability to fall away from good.  For it is from the
Spirit that the powers derive their close relationship to God, their
inability to change to evil, and their continuance in blessedness.  Is
it Christ’s advent?  The Spirit is forerunner.  Is there the incarnate
presence?  The Spirit is inseparable.  Working of miracles, and gifts of
healing are through the Holy Spirit.  Demons were driven out by the
Spirit of God.  The devil was brought to naught by the presence of the
Spirit.  Remission of sins was by the gift of the Spirit, for “ye were
washed, ye were sanctified,…in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in
the holy Spirit of our God.” <span id="fr_1129"></span>[1130](#fn_1129)
  There is close relationship with God through the Spirit, for “God hath
sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying Abba,
Father.” <span id="fr_1130"></span>[1131](#fn_1130)   The resurrection
from the dead is effected by the operation of the Spirit, for “Thou
sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and Thou renewest the face
of the earth.” <span id="fr_1131"></span>[1132](#fn_1131)   If here
creation may be taken to mean the bringing of the departed to life
again, how mighty is not the operation of the Spirit, Who is to us the
dispenser of the life that follows on the resurrection, and attunes our
souls to the spiritual life beyond?  Or if here by creation is meant the
change to a better condition of those who in this life have fallen into
sin, (for it is so understood according to the usage of Scripture, as in
the words of Paul “if any man be in Christ he is a new creature” <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1133](#fn_1132) ), the renewal which takes place in
this life, and the transmutation from our earthly and sensuous life to
the heavenly conversation which takes place in us through the Spirit,
then our souls are exalted to the highest pitch of admiration.  With
these thoughts before us are we to be afraid of going beyond due bounds
in the extravagance of the honour we pay?  Shall we not rather fear
lest, even though we seem to give Him the highest names which the
thoughts of man can conceive or man’s tongue utter, we let our thoughts
about Him fall too low?

<span id="vii.xx-p25"></span>It is the Spirit which says, as the Lord
says, “Get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing:  for I have
sent them.” <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1134](#fn_1133)   Are these the
words of an inferior, or of one in dread?  “Separate me Barnabas and
Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.” <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[1135](#fn_1134)   Does a slave speak thus?  And
Isaiah, “The Lord God and His Spirit hath sent me,” <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[1136](#fn_1135) and “the Spirit came down from the
Lord and guided them.” <span id="fr_1136"></span>[1137](#fn_1136)   And
pray do not again understand by this guidance some humble service, for
the Word witnesses that it was the work of God;—“Thou leddest thy
people,” it is said “like a flock,” <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137) and “Thou that leadest Joseph like
a flock,” <span id="fr_1138"></span>[1139](#fn_1138) and “He led them on
safely, so that they feared not.” <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[1140](#fn_1139)   Thus when you hear that when the
Comforter is come, He will put you in remembrance, and “guide you into
all truth,” <span id="fr_1140"></span>[1141](#fn_1140) do not
misrepresent the meaning.

<span id="vii.xx-p34"></span>50.  But, it is said that “He maketh
intercession for us.” <span id="fr_1141"></span>[1142](#fn_1141)   It
follows then that, as the suppliant is inferior to the benefactor, so
far is the Spirit inferior in dignity to God.  But have you never heard
concerning the Only-begotten that He “is at the right hand of God, who
also maketh intercession for us”? <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[1143](#fn_1142)   Do not, then, because the Spirit
is in you,—if indeed He is at all in you,—nor yet because He teaches us
who were blinded, and guides us to the choice of what profits us,—do not
for this reason allow yourself to be deprived of the right and holy
opinion concerning Him.  For to make the loving kindness of your
benefactor a ground of ingratitude were indeed a very extravagance of
unfairness.  “Grieve not the Holy Spirit;” <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[1144](#fn_1143) hear the words of Stephen, the
first fruits of the martyrs, when he reproaches the people for their
rebellion and disobedience; “you do always,” he says, “resist the Holy
Ghost;” <span id="fr_1144"></span>[1145](#fn_1144) and again
Isaiah,—“They vexed His Holy Spirit, therefore He was turned to be their
enemy;” <span id="fr_1145"></span>[1146](#fn_1145) and in another
passage, “the house of Jacob angered the Spirit of the Lord.” <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1147](#fn_1146)   Are not these pas<span
id="page_32">p. 32</span> <span id="vii.xx-Page_32"></span>sages
indicative of authoritative power?  I leave it to the judgment of my
readers to determine what opinions we ought to hold when we hear these
passages; whether we are to regard the Spirit as an instrument, a
subject, of equal rank with the creature, and a fellow servant of
ourselves, or whether, on the contrary, to the ears of the pious the
mere whisper of this blasphemy is not most grievous.  Do you call the
Spirit a servant?  But, it is said, “the servant knoweth not what his
Lord doeth,” <span id="fr_1147"></span>[1148](#fn_1147) and yet the
Spirit knoweth the things of God, as “the spirit of man that is in
him.” <span id="fr_1148"></span>[1149](#fn_1148)

Mr. C. F. Johnston remarks:  “In [Isaiah xlviii.
16](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#016)<span id="vii.xx-p28.2"></span> St.
Didymus, as translated by St. Jerome, gives *Spiritum suum*.  The Targum
has the same.  St. Ambrose writes:  ‘*Quis est qui dicit; misit me
Dominus Deus et Spiritus Ejus; nisi Qui venit a Patre, ut salvos faceret
peccatores?  Quem ut audis, et Spiritus misit; ne cum legis quia Filius
Spiritum mittit, inferioris esse Spiritum crederes potestatis*,’ (*De
Sp. S.* iii. 1, § 7.)  The passage is quoted by St. Athanasius, St.
Basil, St. Cyril Hieros., and, as far as the editor is aware, without
any comment which would help to determine their way of understanding the
case of <span class="Greek"><span id="vii.xx-p28.3"></span>τὸ
πνεῦμα</span>; but Origen, on the words ‘Whosoever shall humble himself
as this little child’ (*Comm. in Evang*., [Matt. xiii.
18](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#018)<span id="vii.xx-p28.4"></span>)
says,—quoting the original, which may be rendered, “‘humbling himself as
this little child is imitating the Holy Spirit, who humbled Himself for
men’s salvation.  That the Saviour and the Holy Ghost were sent by the
Father for the salvation of men is made plain by Isaiah saying, in the
person of the Saviour, ‘the Lord sent me, and His Spirit.’  It must be
observed, however, that the phrase is ambiguous, for either God sent and
the Holy Ghost also sent, the Saviour; or, as I understand, the Father
sent both, the Saviour and the Holy Ghost.’”  The Vulgate and Beza both
render “*Spiritus*.”  The order of the Hebrew is in favour of the
nominative, as in the Vulgate and lxx.  *cf*. Note A on Chap. xlviii. of
Isaiah in the *Speaker’s Commentary*.
