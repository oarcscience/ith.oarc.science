id="ix.lxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter LXIII. <span
id="fr_2227"></span>[2228](#fn_2227) </span>

<span id="ix.lxiv-p3"></span>*To the Governor of Neocæsarea*.

<span id="ix.lxiv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxiv-p4.1"></span>The</span> wise man, even if he dwells far
away, even if I never set eyes on him, I count a friend.  So says the
tragedian Euripides.  And so, if, though I have never had the pleasure
of meeting your excellency in person, I speak of myself as a familiar
friend, pray do not set this down to mere empty compliment.  Common
report, which loudly proclaims your universal benevolence, is, in this
instance, the promoter of friendship.  Indeed since I met the highly
respectable Elpidius, <span id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228) I have
known you as well, and I have been as completely captured by you, as
though I had long lived with you and had practical experience of your
excellent qualities.  For he did not cease telling me about you,
mentioning one by one your magnanimity, your exalted sentiments, your
mild manners, your skill in business, intelligence, dignity tempered by
cheerfulness, and eloquence.  All the other points that he enumerated in
his long conversation with me it is impossible for me to write to you,
without extending my letter beyond all reasonable bounds.  How can I
fail to love such a man?  How could I put such restraint upon myself as
not loudly to proclaim what I feel?  Accept then, most excellent Sir,
the greeting which I send you, for it is inspired by true and unfeigned
friendship.  I abhor all servile compliment.  Pray keep me enrolled in
the list of your friends, and, by frequently writing to me, bring
yourself before me and comfort me in your absence.

<span id="ix.lxiv-p5"></span> Another reading is Helladius.  *cf.
Letters* lxiv., lxxvii., and lxxviii.  The identification of these
Elpidii is conjectural.  The name was common.
