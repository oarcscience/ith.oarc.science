<p class="c20"><a name="ix.ccxlix-p4"></A><span class="c14"><a name="ix.ccxlix-p4.1"></A>So</span> far as my own wishes are concerned I am grieved at living at such a distance from your reverence.&#160; But, as regards the peace of your own life, I thank the Lord Who has kept you out of this conflagration which has specially ravaged my diocese.&#160; For the just Judge has sent me, in accordance with my works, a messenger of Satan,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3087"></A><A HREF="#fn_3087"><FONT SIZE="1">3088</FONT></A>
 who is buffeting me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3088"></A><A HREF="#fn_3088"><FONT SIZE="1">3089</FONT></A>
 severely enough, and is vigorously defending the heresy.&#160; Indeed to such a pitch has he carried the war against us, that he does not shrink even from shedding the blood of those who trust in God.&#160; You cannot fail to have heard that a man of the name of Asclepius,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3089"></A><A HREF="#fn_3089"><FONT SIZE="1">3090</FONT></A>
 because he would not consent to communion with Doeg,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3090"></A><A HREF="#fn_3090"><FONT SIZE="1">3091</FONT></A>
 has died under the blows inflicted on him by them, or rather, by their blows has been translated into life.&#160; You may suppose that the rest of their doings are of a piece with this; the persecutions of presbyters and teachers, and all that might be expected to be done by men abusing the imperial authority at their own caprice.&#160; But, in answer to your prayers, the Lord will give us release from these things, and patience to bear the weight of our trials worthily of our hope in Him.&#160; Pray write frequently to me of all that concerns yourself.&#160; If you find any one who can be trusted to carry you the book that I have finished, be so kind as to send for it, that so, when I have been cheered by your approval, I may send it on to others also.&#160; By the grace of the Holy One may you be granted to me and to the Church of the Lord in good health rejoicing in the Lord, and praying for me.</p>
