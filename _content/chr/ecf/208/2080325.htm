<p class="c20"><a name="ix.ccliii-p6"></A><span class="c14"><a name="ix.ccliii-p6.1"></A>The</span> honours of martyrs ought to be very eagerly coveted by all who rest their hopes on the Lord, and more especially by you who seek after virtue.&#160; By your disposition towards the great and good among your fellow servants you are shewing your affection to our common Lord.&#160; Moreover, a special reason for this is to be found in the tie, as it were, of blood, which binds the life of exact discipline to those who have been made perfect through endurance.&#160; Since then Eupsychius and Damas and their company are most illustrious among martyrs, and their memory is yearly kept in our city and all the neighbourhood, the Church, calling on you by my voice, reminds you to keep up your ancient custom of paying a visit.&#160; A great and good work lies before you among the people, who desire to be edified by you, and are anxious for the reward dependent on the honour paid to the martyrs.&#160; Receive, therefore, my supplications, and consent of your kindness to give at the cost of small trouble to yourselves a great boon to me.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3115"></A><A HREF="#fn_3115"><FONT SIZE="1">3116</FONT></A>
