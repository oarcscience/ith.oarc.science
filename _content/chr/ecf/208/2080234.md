<span id="ix.clxii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.clxii-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXI. <span
id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539) </span>

<span id="ix.clxii-p3"></span>*To Amphilochius on his consecration as
Bishop*.

<span id="ix.clxii-p4"></span>1.  <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxii-p4.1"></span>Blessed</span> be God Who from age to age
chooses them that please Him, distinguishes vessels of election, and
uses them for the ministry of the Saints.  Though you were trying to
flee, as you confess, not from me, but from the calling you expected
through me, He has netted you in the sure meshes of grace, and has
brought you into the midst of Pisidia to catch men for the Lord, and
draw the devil’s prey from the deep into the light.  You, too, may say
as the blessed David said, “Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or
whither shall I flee from thy presence.” <span
id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540)   Such is the wonderful work of our
loving Master.  “Asses are lost” <span
id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541) that there may be a king of
Israel.  David, however, being an Israelite was granted to Israel; but
the land which has nursed you and brought you to such a height of
virtue, possesses you no longer, and sees her neighbour beautified by
her own adornment.  But all believers in Christ are one people; all
Christ’s people, although He is hailed from many regions, are one
Church; and so our country is glad and rejoices at the dispensation of
the Lord, and instead of thinking that she is one man the poorer,
considers that through one man she has become possessed of whole
Churches.  Only may the Lord grant me both to see you in person, and, so
long as I am parted from you, to hear of your progress in the gospel,
and of the good order of your Churches.

<span id="ix.clxii-p7"></span>2.  Play the man, then, and be strong, and
walk before the people whom the Most High has entrusted to your hand. 
Like a skilful pilot, rise in mind above every wave lifted by heretical
blasts; keep the boat from being whelmed by the salt and bitter billows
of false doctrine; and wait for the calm to be made by the Lord so soon
as there shall have been found a voice worthy of rousing Him to rebuke
the winds and the sea.  If you wish to visit me, now hurried by long
sickness towards the inevitable end, do not wait for an opportunity, or
for the word from me.  You know that to a father’s heart every time is
suitable to embrace a well-loved <span id="page_215">p. 215</span> <span
id="ix.clxii-Page_215"></span>son, and that affection is stronger than
words.  Do not lament over a responsibility transcending your strength. 
If you had been destined to bear the burden unaided, it would have been
not merely heavy; it would have been intolerable.  But if the Lord
shares the load with you, “cast all your care upon the Lord” <span
id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542) and He will Himself act.  Only be
exhorted ever to give heed lest you be carried away by wicked customs. 
Rather change all previous evil ways into good by the help of the wisdom
given you by God.  For Christ has sent you not to follow others, but
yourself to take the lead of all who are being saved.  I charge you to
pray for me, that, if I am still in this life, I may be permitted to see
you with your Church.  If, however, it is ordained that I now depart,
may I see all of you hereafter with the Lord, your Church blooming like
a vine with good works, and yourself like a wise husbandman and good
servant giving meat in due season to his fellow-servants and receiving
the reward of a wise and trusty steward.  All who are with me salute
your reverence.  May you be strong and joyful in the Lord.  May you be
preserved glorious in the graces of the Spirit and of wisdom.
