id="ix.cccxxxvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CCCXLI.</span>

<span id="ix.cccxxxvi-p2"></span> Libanius to Basil.

<span id="ix.cccxxxvi-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccxxxvi-p3.1"></span>You</span> have not yet ceased to be
offended with me, and so I tremble as I write.  If you <span
id="page_323">p. 323</span> <span id="ix.cccxxxvi-Page_323"></span>have
cared, why, my dear sir, do you not write?  If you are still offended, a
thing alien from any reasonable soul and from your own, why, while you
are preaching to others, that they must not keep their anger till
sundown, <span id="fr_3275"></span>[3276](#fn_3275) have you kept yours
during many suns?  Peradventure you have meant to punish me by depriving
me of the sound of your sweet voice?  Nay; excellent sir, be gentle, and
let me enjoy your golden tongue.

and the passage quoted by Alford from Plut., *De Am. Frat*. 488 B., to
the effect that the Pythagoreans, whenever anger had caused unkindly
words, shook hands before sundown, and were reconciled.
