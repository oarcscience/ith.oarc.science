<span id="ix.cccl-p2"></span>Libanius to Basil.

<span id="ix.cccl-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccl-p3.1"></span>Are</span> you living at Athens, Basil?  Have
you forgotten yourself?  The sons of the Cæsareans could not endure to
hear these things.  My tongue was not accustomed to them.  Just as
though I were treading some dangerous ground, and were struck at the
novelty of the sounds, it said to me its father, “My father, you never
taught this!  This man is Homer, or Plato, or Aristotle, or Susarion. 
He knows everything.”  So far my tongue.  I only wish, Basil, that you
could praise me in the same manner!
