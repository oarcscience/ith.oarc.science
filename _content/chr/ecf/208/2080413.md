<span id="ix.cccxli-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.cccxli-p1.1"></span>Letter CCCXLVI.</span>

<span id="ix.cccxli-p2"></span>Libanius to Basil.

<span id="ix.cccxli-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccxli-p3.1"></span>You</span> yourself will judge whether I have
added anything in the way of learning to the young men whom you have
sent.  I hope that this addition, however little it be, will get the
credit of being great, for the sake of your friendship towards me.  But
inasmuch as you give less praise to learning than to temperance and to a
refusal to abandon our souls to dishonourable pleasures, they have
devoted their main attention to this, and have lived, as indeed they
ought, with due recollection of the friend who sent them hither.

<span id="ix.cccxli-p4"></span>So welcome what is your own, and give
praise to men who by their mode of life have done credit both to you and
to me.  But to ask you to be serviceable to them is like asking a father
to be serviceable to his children.
