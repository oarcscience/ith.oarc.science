<span id="ix.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ii-p1.1"></span>Letter I. <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[1737](#fn_1736) </span>

<span id="ix.ii-p3"></span>*To Eustathius the Philosopher.* <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[1738](#fn_1737)

<span id="ix.ii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ii-p5.1"></span>Much</span> distressed as I was by the flouts of
what is called fortune, who always seems to be hindering my meeting you,
I was wonderfully cheered and comforted by your letter, for I had
already been turning over in my mind whether what so many people say is
really true, that there is a certain Necessity or Fate which rules all
the events of our lives both great and small, and that we human beings
have control over nothing; or, that at all events, all human life is
driven by a kind of luck. <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1739](#fn_1738)  
You will be very ready to forgive me for these reflexions, when you
learn by what causes I was led to make them.

<span id="ix.ii-p7"></span>On hearing of your philosophy, I entertained
a feeling of contempt for the teachers of Athens, and left it.  The city
on the Hellespont I passed by, more unmoved than any Ulysses, passing
Sirens’ songs. <span id="fr_1739"></span>[1740](#fn_1739)

<span id="ix.ii-p9"></span>Asia <span
id="fr_1740"></span>[1741](#fn_1740) I admired; but I hurried on to the
capital of all that is best in it.  When I arrived home, and did not
find you,—the prize which I had sought so eagerly,—there began many and
various unexpected hindrances.  First I must miss you because I fell
ill; then when you were setting out for the East I could not start with
you; then, after endless trouble, I reached Syria, but I missed the
philosopher, who had set out for Egypt.  Then I must set out for Egypt,
a long and weary way, and even there I did not gain my end.  But so
passionate was my longing that I must either set out for Persia, and
proceed with you to the farthest lands of barbarism, (you had got there;
what an obstinate devil possessed me!) or settle here at Alexandria. 
This last I did.  I really think that unless, like some tame beast, I
had followed a bough held out <span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span
id="ix.ii-Page_110"></span>to me till I was quite worn out, you would
have been driven on and on beyond Indian Nyssa, <span
id="fr_1741"></span>[1742](#fn_1741) or any more remote region, and
wandered about out there.  Why say more?

<span id="ix.ii-p12"></span>On returning home, I cannot meet you,
hindered by lingering ailments.  If these do not get better I shall not
be able to meet you even in the winter.  Is not all this, as you
yourself say, due to Fate?  Is not this Necessity?  Does not my case
nearly outdo poets’ tales of Tantalus?  But, as I said, I feel better
after getting your letter, and am now no longer of the same mind.  When
God gives good things I think we must thank Him, and not be angry with
Him while He is controlling their distribution.  So if He grant me to
join you, I shall think it best and most delightful; if He put me off, I
will gently endure the loss.  For He always rules our lives better than
we could choose for ourselves.

<span id="ix.ii-p2"></span> Placed in 357.

<span id="ix.ii-p4"></span> Another <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ii-p4.1"></span>ms.</span> reading is “To Eustathius, Presbyter
of Antioch.”  The Benedictine note is “Eustathius was not a Presbyter,
but a heathen, as is indicated by Basil’s words, ‘Are not these things
work of fate,—of necessity, as you would say?’”

<span id="fn_1738"></span>[109:1739](2080074.htm#fr_1738) <span
id="ix.ii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p6"></span> The word <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ii-p6.1"></span>τύχη</span> does not occur in the N.T.

<span id="fn_1739"></span>[109:1740](2080074.htm#fr_1739) <span

id="ix.ii-p8.2"></span>ς</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.ii-p8.3"></span>ουδεὶς ᾽Οδυσσεύς</span>.  The Ben. translation is
“citius *quam quisquam Ulysses*.”  But the reason of the escape of
Ulysses was not his speed, but his stopping the ears of his crew with
wax and tying himself to the mast.  *cf*. Hom. *Od*. xii. 158.  The
“city on the Hellespont,” is, according to the Ben. note,
Constantinople; but Constantinople is more than 100 m. from the
Dardanelles, and Basil could hardly write so loosely.

<span id="ix.ii-p10"></span> Apparently not the Roman Province of Asia,
but what we call Asia Minor, a name which came into use in Basil’s
century.  The “metropolis” is supposed to mean Cæsarea.
