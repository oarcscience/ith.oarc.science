<p class="c20"><a name="ix.clxxix-p5"></A>I <span class="c14"><a name="ix.clxxix-p5.1"></A>know</span> that I have often recommended many persons to your excellency, and so in serious emergencies have been very useful to friends in distress.&#160; But I do not think that I have ever sent to you one whom I regard with greater respect, or one engaged in contests of greater importance, than my very dear son Eusebius, who now places this letter in your hands.&#160; He will himself inform your excellency, if the opportunity is permitted him, in what difficulties he is involved.&#160; I ought to say, at least, as much as this.&#160; The man ought not to be misjudged, nor, because many have been convicted of disgraceful doings, ought he to come under common suspicion.&#160; He ought to have a fair trial, and his life must be enquired into.&#160; In this way the untruth of the charges against him will be made plain, and he, after enjoying your righteous protection, will ever proclaim what he owes to your kindness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2588"></A><A HREF="#fn_2588"><FONT SIZE="1">2589</FONT></A>
