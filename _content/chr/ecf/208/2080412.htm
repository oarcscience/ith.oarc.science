<p class="c20"><a name="ix.cccxl-p3"></A><span class="c14"><a name="ix.cccxl-p3.1"></A>It</span> is, I think, more needful for me to defend myself for not having begun to write to you long ago, than to offer any excuse for beginning now.&#160; I am that same man who always used to run up whenever you put in an appearance, and who listened with the greatest delight to the stream of your eloquence; rejoicing to hear you; with difficulty tearing myself away; saying to my friends, This man is thus far superior to the daughters of Achelous, in that, like them, he soothes, but he does not hurt as they do.&#160; Truly it is no great thing not to hurt; but this man&#146;s songs are a positive gain to the hearer.&#160; That I should be in this state of mind, should think that I am regarded with affection, and should seem able to speak, and yet should not venture to write, is the mark of a man guilty of extreme idleness, and, at the same time, inflicting punishment on himself.&#160; For it is clear that you will requite my poor little letter with a fine large one, and will take care not to wrong me again.&#160; At this word, I fancy, many will cry out, and will crowd round with the shout, What! has Basil done any wrong&#8212;even a small wrong?&#160; Then so have &#338;acus, and Minos and his brother.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3277"></A><A HREF="#fn_3277"><FONT SIZE="1">3278</FONT></A>
&#160; In other points I admit that you have won.&#160; Who ever saw you that does not envy you?&#160; But in one thing you have sinned against me; and, if I remind you of it, induce those who are indignant thereat not to make a public outcry.&#160; No one has ever come to you and asked a favour which it was easy to give, and gone away unsuccessful.&#160; But I am one of those who have craved a boon without receiving it.&#160; What then did I ask?&#160; Often when I was with you in camp, I was desirous of entering, with the aid of your wisdom, into the depth of Homer&#146;s frenzy.&#160; If the whole is impossible, I said, do you bring me to a portion of what I <A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A> <a name="ix.cccxl-Page_324"></A>want.&#160; I was anxious for a part, wherein, when things have gone ill with the Greeks, Agamemnon courts with gifts the man whom he has insulted.&#160; When I so spoke, you laughed, because you could not deny that you could if you liked, but were unwilling to give.&#160; Do I really seem to be wronged to you and to your friends, who were indignant at my saying that you were doing a wrong?</p>
