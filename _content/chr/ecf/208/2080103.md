id="ix.xxxi-p1.1"></span>Letter XXX. <span
id="fr_2003"></span>[2004](#fn_2003) </span>

<span id="ix.xxxi-p3"></span>*To Eusebius of Samosata*.

<span id="ix.xxxi-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxxi-p4.1"></span>If</span> I were to write at length all the
causes which, up to the present time, have kept me at home, eager as I
have been to set out to see your reverence, I should tell an
interminable story.  I say nothing of illnesses coming one upon another,
hard winter weather, and press of work, for all this has been already
made known to you.  Now, for my sins, I have lost my Mother, <span
id="fr_2004"></span>[2005](#fn_2004) the only comfort I had in life.  Do
not smile, if, old as I am, I lament my orphanhood.  Forgive me if I
cannot endure separation from a soul, to compare with whom I see nothing
in the future that lies before me.  So once more my complaints have come
back to me; once more I am confined to my bed, tossing about in my
weakness, and every hour all but looking for the end of life; and the
Churches are in somewhat the same condition as my body, no good hope
shining on them, and their state always changing for the worse.  In the
meantime Neocæsarea and Ancyra have decided to have successors of the
dead, and so far they are at peace.  Those who are plotting against me
have not yet been permitted to do anything worthy of their bitterness
and wrath.  This we make no secret of attributing to your prayers on
behalf of the Churches.  Weary not then in praying for the Churches and
in entreating God.  Pray give all salutations to those who are
privileged to minister to your Holiness.
