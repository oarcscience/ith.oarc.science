id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047) </span>

<span id="ix.xl-p3"></span>*Julian <span
id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048)* *to Basil*.

<span id="ix.xl-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xl-p5.1"></span>The</span> proverb says “You are not pro<span
id="page_142">p. 142</span> <span id="ix.xl-Page_142"></span>claiming
war,” <span id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049) and, let me add, out of
the comedy, “O messenger of golden words.” <span
id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050)   Come then; prove this in act, and
hasten to me.  You will come as friend to friend.  Conspicuous and
unremitting devotion to business seems, to those that treat it as of
secondary importance, a heavy burden; yet the diligent are modest, as I
persuade myself, sensible, and ready for any emergency.  I allow myself
relaxations so that even rest may be permitted to one who neglects
nothing.  Our mode of life is not marked by the court hypocrisy, of
which I think you have had some experience, and in accordance with which
compliments mean deadlier hatred than is felt to our worst foes; but,
with becoming freedom, while we blame and rebuke where blame is due, we
love with the love of the dearest friends.  I may therefore, let me say,
with all sincerity, both be diligent in relaxation and, when at work,
not get worn out, and sleep secure; since when awake I do not wake more
for myself, than, as is fit, for every one else.  I am afraid this is
rather silly and trifling, as I feel rather lazy, (I praise myself like
Astydamas <span id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051) ) but I am writing
to prove to you that to have the pleasure of seeing you, wise man as you
are, will be more likely to do me good than to cause any difficulty. 
Therefore, as I have said, lose no time:  travel post haste.  After you
have paid me as long a visit as you like, you shall go on your journey,
whithersoever you will, with my best wishes.

<span id="ix.xl-p2"></span> To be placed probably in 362, if genuine.

<span id="ix.xl-p4"></span> These Letters are placed in this order by
the Ben. Editors as being written, if genuine, before Basil’s
episcopate.  Maran (*Vita S. Bas. Cap*. ii.) is puzzled at Basil’s
assertion in xli. that he learned the Bible with Julian, and points out
that at Athens they devoted themselves to profane literature.  But this
may have allowed intervals for other work.  In 344, when Basil was at
Cæsarea, Julian was relegated by Constantius to the neighbouring
fortress of Macellum, and there, with his elder half-brother Gallus,
spent six years in compulsory retirement.  Sozomen tells us that the
brothers studied the Scripture and became Readers (Soz. v. 2; Amm. Marc.
xv. 2, 7).  Their seclusion, in which they were reduced to the society
of their own household (Greg. Naz., *Or*. iii., Julian, *Ad. Ath*. 271
c.), may not have been so complete as to prevent all intercourse with a
harmless schoolboy like Basil.  “*<span id="ix.xl-p4.1"></span>Malgré
l’authorité de dom Maran, nous croyons avec Tillemont, Dupont et M.
Albert de Broglie, que cette lettre a été réellement adressée par
Julien, non a un homonyme de St. Basile mais à St. Basile lui-même.”
