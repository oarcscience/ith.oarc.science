id="ix.clxxxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CLXXXIII. <span
id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597) </span>

<span id="ix.clxxxiv-p3"></span>*To the Senate of Samosata*.

<span id="ix.clxxxiv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.clxxxiv-p4.1"></span>Seeing</span>, as I do, that temptation is
now spread all over the world, and that the greater cities of Syria have
been tried by the same sufferings as yourselves, (though, indeed,
nowhere is the Senate so approved and renowned for good works, as your
own, noted as you are for your righteous zeal,) I all but thank the
troubles which have befallen you. <span
id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598)

<span id="ix.clxxxiv-p6"></span>For had not this affliction come to
pass, your proof under trial would never have been known.  To all that
earnestly strive for any good, the affliction they endure for the sake
of their hope in God is like a furnace to gold. <span
id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599)

<span id="ix.clxxxiv-p8"></span>Rouse ye, then, most excellent sirs,
that the labours you are about to undertake may not be unworthy of those
which you have already sustained, and that on a firm foundation you may
be seen putting a yet worthier finish.  Rouse ye, that ye may stand
round about the shepherd of the Church, when the Lord grants him to be
seen on his own throne, telling each of you in his turn. some good deed
done for the sake of the Church of God.  On the great day of the Lord,
each, according to the proportion of his labours, shall receive his
recompense from the munificent Lord.  By remembering me and writing to
me as often as you can, you will be doing justice in sending me a reply,
and will moreover give me very great pleasure, by sending me in writing
a plain token of a voice which it is delightful to me to hear.

themselves is of a piece with the expression of gratitude to enemies in
the *De. Sp. S.* vi. § 13. (p. 8), and concludes:  “*Sic etiam

pene gratias agere*.
