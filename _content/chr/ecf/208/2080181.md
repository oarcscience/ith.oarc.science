id="fr_2370"></span>[2371](#fn_2370) </span>

<span id="ix.cix-p3"></span>*To the guardian of the heirs of Julitta*.

<span id="ix.cix-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cix-p4.1"></span>I am</span> very much astonished to hear that,
after the kind promises which you made and which were only such as might
be expected from your generous character, you have now forgotten them
and are putting violent and stern pressure on our sister.  What to
think, under the circumstances, I really do not know.   I know from many
who have experienced your liberality, and bear testimony to it, how
great it is; and I remember the promises which you made before me and
the ex-prefect.  You said that you were naming a shorter time in
writing, but that you would grant a longer term of grace, from your wish
to meet the necessities of the case, and do a favour to the widow, who
is now compelled to pay out of her substance such a large sum of money
at once.  What is the cause of this change I cannot imagine.  However,
whatever it is, I beg you to be mindful of your own generous character,
and to look to the Lord Who requites good deeds.  I beg you to grant the
time of remission, which you promised at the outset, that they may be
able to sell their property and discharge the debt.  I perfectly well
remember that you promised, if you received the sum agreed on, to
restore to the widow all the stipulated documents, as well those which
had been executed before the magistrates as the private papers.  I do
beg you then, honour me and win great blessing for yourself from the
Lord.  Remember your own promises, recognizing that you are human and
must yourself look for that time when you will need God’s help.  Do not
shut yourself off from that help by your present severity; but, by
showing all kindness and clemency to the afflicted, attract God’s pity
to yourself.
