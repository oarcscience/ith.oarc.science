<p class="c54"><a name="ix.cccxxxi-p2"></A>Libanius to Basilius.</p>  
<p class="c20"><a name="ix.cccxxxi-p3"></A>1.&#160; <span class="c14"><a name="ix.cccxxxi-p3.1"></A>After</span> some little time a young Cappadocian has reached me.&#160; One gain to me is that he is a Cappadocian.&#160; But this Cappadocian is one of the first rank.&#160; This is another gain.&#160; Further, he brings me a letter from the admirable Basil.&#160; This is the greatest gain of all.&#160; You think that I have forgotten you.&#160; I had great respect for you in your youth.&#160; I saw you vying with old men in self-restraint, and this in a city teeming with pleasures.&#160; I saw you already in possession of considerable learning.&#160; Then you thought that you ought also to see Athens, and you persuaded Celsus to accompany you.&#160; Happy Celsus, to be dear to you!&#160; Then you returned, and lived at home, and I said to myself, What, I wonder, is Basil about now?&#160; To what occupation has he betaken himself?&#160; Is he following the ancient orators, and practising in the courts?&#160; Or is he turning the sons of fortunate fathers into orators?&#160; Then there came <A NAME="page_321"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 321</FONT></A> <a name="ix.cccxxxi-Page_321"></A>those who reported to me that you were adopting a course of life better than any of these, and were, rather, bethinking you how you might win the friendship of God than heaps of gold, I blessed both you and the Cappadocians; you, for making this your aim; them, for being able to point to so noble a fellow-countryman.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cccxxxi-p4"></A>2.&#160; I am aware that the Firmus, whom you mention, has continually won everywhere;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3267"></A><A HREF="#fn_3267"><FONT SIZE="1">3268</FONT></A>
 hence his great power as a speaker.&#160; But with all the eulogies that have been bestowed on him, I am not aware that he has ever received such praise as I have heard of in your letter.&#160; For what a credit it is to him, that it should be you who declare that his reputation is inferior to none!</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cccxxxi-p6"></A>Apparently, you have despatched this young man to me before seeing Firminus; had you done so, your letters would not have failed to mention him.&#160; What is Firminus now doing or intending to do?&#160; Is he still anxious to be married?&#160; Or is all that over now?&#160; Are the claims of the senate heavy on him?&#160; Is he obliged to stay where he is?&#160; Is there any hope of his taking to study again ?&#160; Let him send me an answer, and I trust it may be satisfactory.&#160; If it be a distressing one, at least it will relieve him from seeing me at his door.&#160; And if Firminus had been now at Athens, what would your senators have done?&#160; Would they have sent the Salaminia&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3268"></A><A HREF="#fn_3268"><FONT SIZE="1">3269</FONT></A>
 after him?&#160; You see that it is only by your fellow-countrymen that I am wronged.&#160; Yet I shall never cease to love and praise the Cappadocians.&#160; I should like them to be better disposed to me, but, if they continue to act as they do, I shall bear it.&#160; Firminus was four months with me, and was not a day idle.&#160; You will know how much he has acquired, and perhaps will not complain.&#160; As to his being able to come here again, what ally can I call in?&#160; If your senators are right-minded, as men of education ought to be, they will honour me in the second case, since they grieved me in the first.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.cccxxxi-p7"></A> The allusion is to the &#8220;Salaminia,&#8221; one of the two sacred or state vessels of the Athenian government.&#160; The &#8220;Paralus&#8221; and the &#8220;Salaminia&#8221; were both Triremes, the latter being called also &#8220;Delia&#8221; and &#8220;Theoris,&#8221; because it was used to convey the <span class="Greek"><a name="ix.cccxxxi-p7.1"></A>&#952;&#949;&#969;&#961;&#959;&#8054;</span> to Delos.&#160; State criminals were conveyed by them.</p>
