 (a still further touch of trouble) and whose &#8220;Princes&#8221; do not &#8220;eat&#8221; after night but revel at mid-day, raging after other men&#146;s wives with less understanding than brute beasts.&#160; This man must surely look for the scourges of the righteous Judge, repaid him in exact requital for those which he himself has previously inflicted on the saints.&#160; Notice has been given to my Church in accordance with the letter of your reverence, and he shall be held by all as abominable, cut off from fire, water and shelter, if indeed in the case of men so possessed there is any use in general and unanimous condemnation.&#160; Notoriety is enough for him, and your own letter, which has been read in all directions, for I shall not fail to show it to all his friends and relatives.&#160; Assuredly, even if retribution <A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A> <a name="ix.lxii-Page_162"></A>does not reach him at once, as it did Pharaoh, certainly it will bring on him hereafter a heavy and hard requital.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.lxii-p4"></A> This, the first of Basil&#146;s six extant letters to Athanasius, is placed by the Ben. Ed. in 371.&#160; It has no certain indication of date.&#160; Athanasius, in the few years of comparative calm which preceded his death in May, 373, had excommunicated a vicious governor in Libya, a native of Cappadocia, and announced his act to Basil.&#160; The intercourse opened by this official communication led to a more important correspondence.</p>
