<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cxxxvii-p6"></A>2.&#160; I need hardly tell you how deplorable and hopeless is the condition of the Churches.&#160; Now, for the sake of our own safety, we neglect our neighbour&#146;s, and do not even seem able to see that general disaster involves individual ruin.&#160; Least of all need I say this to one who, like yourself, foresaw the future from afar, and has foretold and proclaimed it and has been among the first to be roused, and to rouse the rest, writing letters, coming yourself in person, leaving no deed undone, no word unspoken.&#160; I remember this in every instance, but yet we are none the better off.&#160; Now, indeed, were not my sins in the way, (first of all, my dear brother the reverend deacon Eustathius fell seriously ill and detained me two whole months, looking day by day for his restoration to health; and then all about me fell sick; brother Isaaces will tell you the rest; then last of all I myself was attacked by this complaint) I should long ago have been to see your excellency, not indeed thereby to try to improve the general state of affairs, but to get some good for myself from your society.&#160; I had made up my mind to get out of the reach of the ecclesiastical artillery, because I am quite unprepared to meet my enemies&#146; attacks.&#160; May God&#146;s mighty hand preserve you for all of us, as a noble guardian of the faith, and a vigilant champion of the Churches; and grant me, before I die, to meet you for the comfort of my soul.</p>
