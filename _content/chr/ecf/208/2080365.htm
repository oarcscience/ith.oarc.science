<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxciii-p4"></A>And I am the more desirous of seeing you, now that I hear you have been adorned with that great ornament, the clothing of immortality, which clokes our mortality, and puts out of sight the death of the flesh; by virtue of which the corruptible is swallowed up in incorruption.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.ccxciii-p5"></A>Thus God of His goodness has now alienated you from sin, united you to Himself, has opened the doors of Heaven, and pointed out the paths that lead to heavenly bliss.&#160; I entreat you therefore by that wisdom wherein you excel all other men, that you receive the divine favour circumspectly, proving a faithful guardian of this treasure, as the repository of this royal gift, keeping watch over it with all carefulness.&#160; Preserve this seal of righteousness unsullied, that so you may stand before God, shining in the brightness of the Saints.&#160; Let no spot or wrinkle defile the pure robe of immortality; but keep holiness in all your members, as having put on Christ.&#160; &#8220;For,&#8221; it is said, &#8220;as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3257"></A><A HREF="#fn_3257"><FONT SIZE="1">3258</FONT></A>
&#160; Wherefore let all your members be holy as becomes their investment in a raiment of holiness and light.</p>
