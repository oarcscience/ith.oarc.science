<span id="page_154">p. 154</span> <span

slumbering, than you, my godly lord, who have shewn your general
excellence in this, too, that you have consented to come down among us,
your lowly inferiors, like a true disciple of Him Who said, “I am among
you,” not as a fellow guest, but “as he that serveth.” <span
id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173)   For you have condescended to
minister to us your spiritual gladness, to refresh our souls by your
honoured letter, and, as it were, to fling the arms of your greatness
round the infancy of children.  We, therefore, implore your good soul to
pray, that we may be worthy to receive aid from the great, such as
yourself, and to have a mouth and wisdom wherewith to chime in with the
strain of all, who like you are led by the Holy Spirit.  Of Him I hear
that you are a friend and true worshipper, and I am deeply thankful for
your strong and unshaken love to God.  I pray that my lot may be found
with the true worshippers, among whom we are sure your excellency is to
be ranked, as well as that great and true bishop who has filled all the
world with his wonderful work.

<span id="ix.li-p2"></span> Placed at the beginning of the Episcopate.

<span id="ix.li-p4"></span> The Benedictine title runs, *Basilius
gratias agit Episcopo cuidam*, and a Ben. note points out that the
common addition of “of Rome” to the title must be an error, because
Damasus, not Innocent, was Bishop of Rome at the time.  Combefis
supposed that the letter was written to Innocent, then a presbyter, and
that the allusion at the end of the letter is to Damasus; the Ben. note
says *absurde*.  Innocent did not become Bishop of Rome till 402, three
years after Basil’s death.  Whatever was the see of the recipient of
this letter, it was one of importance.  *cf. Letter* lxxxi.
