<span id="ix.xlix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.xlix-p1.1"></span>Letter XLVIII. <span
id="fr_2162"></span>[2163](#fn_2162) </span>

<span id="ix.xlix-p3"></span>*To Eusebius, Bishop of Samosata* <span
id="fr_2163"></span>[2164](#fn_2163) .

<span id="ix.xlix-p5"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xlix-p5.1"></span>have</span> had considerable difficulty in
finding a messenger to convey a letter to your reverence, for our men
are so afraid of the winter that they can hardly bear even to put their
heads outside their houses.  We have suffered from such a very heavy
fall of snow that we have been buried, houses and all, beneath it, and
now for two months have been living in dens and caves.  You know the
Cappadocian character and how hard it is to get us to move. <span
id="fr_2164"></span>[2165](#fn_2164)   Forgive me then for not writing
sooner and bringing to the knowledge of your excellency the latest news
from Antioch.  To tell you all this now, when it is probable that you
learnt it long ago, is stale and uninteresting.  But as I do not reckon
it any trouble to tell you even what you know, I have sent you the
letters conveyed by the reader.  On this point I shall say no more. 
Constantinople has now for some time had Demophilus, <span
id="fr_2165"></span>[2166](#fn_2165) as the bearers of this letter will
themselves tell you, and as has doubtless been reported to your
holiness.  From all who come to us from that city there is unanimously
reported about him a certain counterfeit of orthodoxy and sound
religion, to such an extent that even the divided portions of the city
have been brought to agreement, and some of the neighbouring bishops
have accepted the reconciliation.  Our men here have not turned out
better than I expected.  They came directly you were gone, <span
id="fr_2166"></span>[2167](#fn_2166) said and did many painful things,
and at last went home again, after making their separation from me
wider. <span id="fr_2167"></span>[2168](#fn_2167)   Whether anything
better will happen in the future, and whether they will give up their
evil ways, is unknown to all but God.  So much for our present
condition.  The rest of the Church, by God’s grace, stands sound, and
prays that in the spring we may have you with us again, and be renewed
by your good counsel.  My health is no better than it ever is.

<span id="ix.xlix-p6"></span> The Cappadocians were of notoriously bad
character, and shared with the Cretans and Cilicians the discredit of
illustrating <span class="Greek"><span id="ix.xlix-p6.1"></span>τρία
κάππα κάκιστα</span>.  *cf*. note on Theodoret, *Ecc. Hist*. II. xi. p.
75.  It was Phrygians, however, who were specially notorious for
cowardice.  *cf*. the proverb:  “More cowardly than a Phrygian hare.” 
*cf*. Lightfoot, *Coloss*., etc., p 378 n.  But Cappadocia may claim the
counter credit of having given birth to three of the most famous
divines, Basil and the two Gregorys.

Demophilus was elected by the Arians to fill the vacant see. 
Eustathius, the deposed bishop of Antioch, ordained Evagrius. 
Eustathius and Evagrius were both banished by Valens, and their
adherents cruelly treated.  Soc., *Ecc. Hist*. iv. 14, 16; Soz., *Ecc.
