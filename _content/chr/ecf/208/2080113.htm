&#160; I know this of you, and yet I do not change the old feelings which I had to you, and you to me in the days when we were both young.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2054"></A><A HREF="#fn_2054"><FONT SIZE="1">2055</FONT></A>
&#160; But of my merciful will I command that a thousand pounds of gold be sent me from you, when I pass by C&aelig;sarea; for I am still on the march, and with all possible dispatch am hurrying to the Persian campaign.&#160; If you refuse I am prepared to destroy C&aelig;sarea, to overthrow the buildings that have long adorned it; to erect in their place temples and statues; and so to induce all men to submit to the Emperor of the Romans and not exalt themselves.&#160; Wherefore I charge you to send me without fail by the hands of some trusty messenger the stipulated gold, after duly counting and weighing it, and sealing it with your ring.&#160; In this way I may show mercy to you for your errors, if you acknowledge, however late, that no excuses will avail.&#160; I have learned to know, and to condemn, what once I read.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2055"></A><A HREF="#fn_2055"><FONT SIZE="1">2056</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.xli-p2"></A> If genuine, which is exceedingly doubtful, this letter would be placed in the June or July of 362.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.xli-p5"></A> <i>i.e.</i> of Constantius Chlorus.&#160; <i>Vide</i> pedigree prefixed to Theodoret in this edition, p. 32.&#160; Julian was the youngest son of Julius Constantius, half-brother of Constantine the Great.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.xli-p6"></A> The fact of the early acquaintance of Basil and Julian does not rest wholly on the authority of this doubtful letter.&#160; <i>cf</i>. Greg. Naz., <i>Orat</i>. iv.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.xli-p7"></A> A strong argument against the genuineness of this letter is the silence of Gregory of Nazianzus as to this demand on Basil (<i>Or</i>. v. 39).&#160; For Julian&#146;s treatment of C&aelig;sarea, <i>vide</i> Sozomen v. 4.&#160; Maran (<i>Vita S. Bas</i>. viii.) remarks that when Julian approached C&aelig;sarea Basil was in his Pontic retreat.&#160; On the punning conclusion, <i>vide</i> note on <i>Letter</i> xli.&#160; (<span class="Greek"><a name="ix.xli-p7.1"></A>&#7939;</span> <span class="Greek"><a name="ix.xli-p7.2"></A>&#7936;&#957;&#8051;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#7956;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8051;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span>.)</p>
