id="ix.cxxxv-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXIV. <span
id="fr_2441"></span>[2442](#fn_2441) </span>

<span id="ix.cxxxv-p3"></span>*To the presbyter Pœonius*.

<span id="ix.cxxxv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cxxxv-p4.1"></span>You</span> may conjecture from what it
contains, what pleasure you have given me by your letter.  The pureness
of heart, from which such expressions sprang, was plainly signified by
what you wrote.  A streamlet tells of its own spring, and so the manner
of speech marks the heart from which it came.  I must confess that an
extraordinary and improbable thing has happened to me.  For deeply
anxious as I always was to receive a letter from your excellency, when I
had taken your letter into my hand and had read it, I was not so much
pleased at what you had written, as annoyed at reckoning up the loss I
had suffered in your long silence.  Now that you have begun to write,
pray do not leave off.  You will give me greater pleasure than men can
give by sending much money to misers.  I have had no writer with me,
neither caligraphist, nor short-hand.  Of all those whom I happen to
employ, some have returned to their former mode of life, and others are
unfit for work from long sickness.
