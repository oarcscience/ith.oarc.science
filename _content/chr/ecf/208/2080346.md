id="ix.cclxxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXIII. <span
id="fr_3228"></span>[3229](#fn_3228) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxiv-p3"></span>Without address.  Concerning Hera.

<span id="ix.cclxxiv-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxiv-p4.1"></span>I am</span> sure that your excellency loves
me well enough to regard all that concerns me as concerning you. 
Therefore I commend to your great kindness and high consideration my
very reverend brother Hera, whom I do not merely call brother by any
conventional phrase, but because of his boundless affection.  I beseech
you to regard him as though he were nearly connected with yourself, and,
so far as you can, to give him your protection in the matters in which
he requires your generous and thoughtful aid.  I shall then have this
one more kindness to reckon in addition to the many which I have already
received at your hands.
