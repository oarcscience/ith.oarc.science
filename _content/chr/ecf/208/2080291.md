<span id="ix.ccxix-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxix-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXVIII. <span
id="fr_2852"></span>[2853](#fn_2852) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxix-p3"></span>To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.

<span id="ix.ccxix-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxix-p4.1"></span>Brother</span> <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxix-p4.2"></span>Ælianus</span> has himself completed the
business concerning which he came, and has stood in need of no aid from
me.  I owe him, however, double thanks, both for bringing me a letter
from your reverence and for affording me an opportunity of writing to
you.  By him, therefore, I salute your true and unfeigned love, and
beseech you to pray for me more than ever now, when I stand in such need
of the aid of your prayers.  My health has suffered terribly from the
journey to Pontus and my sickness is unendurable.  One thing I have long
been anxious to make known to you.  I do not mean to say that I have
been so affected by any other cause as to forget it, but now I wish to
put you in mind to send some good man into Lycia, to enquire who are of
the right faith, for peradventure they ought not to be neglected, if
indeed the report is true, which has been brought to me by a pious
traveller from thence, that they have become altogether alienated from
the opinion of the Asiani <span id="fr_2853"></span>[2854](#fn_2853) and
wish to embrace communion with us.  If any one is to go let him enquire
at Corydala <span id="fr_2854"></span>[2855](#fn_2854) for Alexander,
the late monk, the bishop; at Limyra <span
id="fr_2855"></span>[2856](#fn_2855) for Diotimus, and at Myra <span
id="fr_2856"></span>[2857](#fn_2856) for Tatianus, Polemo, <span
id="fr_2857"></span>[2858](#fn_2857) and Macarius presbyters; at
Patara <span id="fr_2858"></span>[2859](#fn_2858) for Eudemus, <span
id="fr_2859"></span>[2860](#fn_2859) the bishop; at Telmessus <span
id="fr_2860"></span>[2861](#fn_2860) for Hilarius, the bishop; at Phelus
for Lallianus, the bishop.  Of these and of more besides I have been
informed that they are sound in the faith, and <span id="page_260">p.
260</span> <span id="ix.ccxix-Page_260"></span>I have been grateful to
God that even any in the Asian region should be clear of the heretic’s
pest.  If, then, it be possible, let us in the meanwhile make personal
enquiry about them.  When we have obtained information I am for writing
a letter, and am anxious to invite one of them to meet me.  God grant
that all may go well with that Church at Iconium, which is so dear to
me.  Through you I salute all the honourable clergy and all who are
associated with your reverence.
