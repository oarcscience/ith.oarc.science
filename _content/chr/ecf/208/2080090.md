<span id="ix.xviii-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xviii-p5.1"></span>It</span> is delightful to listen to you, and
delightful to read you; and I think you give me the greater pleasure by
your writings.  All thanks to our good God Who has not suffered the
truth to suffer in consequence of its betrayal by the chief powers in
the State, but by your means has made the defence of the doctrine of
true religion full and satisfactory.  Like hemlock, monkshood, and other
poisonous herbs, after they have bloomed for a little while, they will
quickly wither away.  But the reward which the Lord will give you in
requital of all that you have said in defence of His name blooms afresh
for ever.  Wherefore I pray God grant you all happiness in your home,
and make His blessing descend to your sons.  I was delighted to see and
embrace those noble boys, express images of your excellent goodness, and
my prayers for them ask all that their father can ask.

<span id="ix.xviii-p4"></span> Nothing is known of this Origen beyond
what is suggested in this letter.  He is conjectured to have been a
layman, who, alike as a rhetorician and a writer, was popularly known as
a Christian apologist.
