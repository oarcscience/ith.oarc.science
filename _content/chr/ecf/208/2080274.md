<span id="ix.ccii-p4"></span>I <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccii-p4.1"></span>long</span> to meet you for many reasons, that
I may have the benefit of your advice in the matters I had in hand, and
that on beholding you after a long interval I may have some comfort for
your absence.  But since both of us are prevented by the same reasons,
you by the illness which has befallen you, and I by the malady of longer
standing which has not yet left me, let us, if you will, each forgive
the other, that both may free ourselves from blame.
