<p class="c20"><a name="ix.clxii-p4"></A>1.&#160; <span class="c14"><a name="ix.clxii-p4.1"></A>Blessed</span> be God Who from age to age chooses them that please Him, distinguishes vessels of election, and uses them for the ministry of the Saints.&#160; Though you were trying to flee, as you confess, not from me, but from the calling you expected through me, He has netted you in the sure meshes of grace, and has brought you into the midst of Pisidia to catch men for the Lord, and draw the devil&#146;s prey from the deep into the light.&#160; You, too, may say as the blessed David said, &#8220;Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2540"></A><A HREF="#fn_2540"><FONT SIZE="1">2541</FONT></A>
&#160; Such is the wonderful work of our loving Master.&#160; &#8220;Asses are lost&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2541"></A><A HREF="#fn_2541"><FONT SIZE="1">2542</FONT></A>
 that there may be a king of Israel.&#160; David, however, being an Israelite was granted to Israel; but the land which has nursed you and brought you to such a height of virtue, possesses you no longer, and sees her neighbour beautified by her own adornment.&#160; But all believers in Christ are one people; all Christ&#146;s people, although He is hailed from many regions, are one Church; and so our country is glad and rejoices at the dispensation of the Lord, and instead of thinking that she is one man the poorer, considers that through one man she has become possessed of whole Churches.&#160; Only may the Lord grant me both to see you in person, and, so long as I am parted from you, to hear of your progress in the gospel, and of the good order of your Churches.</p>  
<p class="c21"><a name="ix.clxii-p7"></A>2.&#160; Play the man, then, and be strong, and walk before the people whom the Most High has entrusted to your hand.&#160; Like a skilful pilot, rise in mind above every wave lifted by heretical blasts; keep the boat from being whelmed by the salt and bitter billows of false doctrine; and wait for the calm to be made by the Lord so soon as there shall have been found a voice worthy of rousing Him to rebuke the winds and the sea.&#160; If you wish to visit me, now hurried by long sickness towards the inevitable end, do not wait for an opportunity, or for the word from me.&#160; You know that to a father&#146;s heart every time is suitable to embrace a well-loved <A NAME="page_215"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215</FONT></A> <a name="ix.clxii-Page_215"></A>son, and that affection is stronger than words.&#160; Do not lament over a responsibility transcending your strength.&#160; If you had been destined to bear the burden unaided, it would have been not merely heavy; it would have been intolerable.&#160; But if the Lord shares the load with you, &#8220;cast all your care upon the Lord&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2542"></A><A HREF="#fn_2542"><FONT SIZE="1">2543</FONT></A>
 and He will Himself act.&#160; Only be exhorted ever to give heed lest you be carried away by wicked customs.&#160; Rather change all previous evil ways into good by the help of the wisdom given you by God.&#160; For Christ has sent you not to follow others, but yourself to take the lead of all who are being saved.&#160; I charge you to pray for me, that, if I am still in this life, I may be permitted to see you with your Church.&#160; If, however, it is ordained that I now depart, may I see all of you hereafter with the Lord, your Church blooming like a vine with good works, and yourself like a wise husbandman and good servant giving meat in due season to his fellow-servants and receiving the reward of a wise and trusty steward.&#160; All who are with me salute your reverence.&#160; May you be strong and joyful in the Lord.&#160; May you be preserved glorious in the graces of the Spirit and of wisdom.</p>
