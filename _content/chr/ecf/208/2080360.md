id="ix.cclxxxviii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCLXXXVII. <span
id="fr_3246"></span>[3247](#fn_3246) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxxviii-p3"></span>Without address.

<span id="ix.cclxxxviii-p4"></span>IT is difficult to deal with this
man.  I scarcely know how to treat so shifty, and, to judge from the
evidence, so desperate a character.  When summoned before the court, he
fails to appear; and if he does attend, he is gifted with such
volubility of words and oaths, that I think myself well off to be
quickly rid of him.  I have often known him twist round his accusations
upon his accusers.  In a word, there is no creature living upon earth so
subtile and versatile in villainy.  A slight acquaintance with him
suffices to prove this.  Why then do you appeal to me?  Why not at once
bring yourselves to submit to his ill-treatment, as to a visitation of
God’s anger?

<span id="ix.cclxxxviii-p5"></span>At the same time you must not be
contaminated by contact with wickedness.

<span id="ix.cclxxxviii-p6"></span>I enjoin therefore that he and all
his household be forbidden the services of the Church, and all other
communion with her ministers.  Being thus made an example of, he may
haply be brought to a sense of his enormities.
