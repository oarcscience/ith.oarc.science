<span id="ix.lxv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.lxv-p5.1"></span>From</span> the beginning I have had many points
in common with your excellency, your love of letters, everywhere
reported by all who have experienced it, and our old friendship with the
admirable Terentius.  But since that most excellent man, who is to me
all that friendship could require, my worthy brother Elpidius, has met
me, and told me all your good qualities, (and who more capable than he
at once to perceive a man’s virtue and to describe it?) he has kindled
in me such a desire to see you, that I pray that you may one day visit
me in my old home, that I may enjoy your good qualities, not merely by
hearing of them, but by actual experience.
