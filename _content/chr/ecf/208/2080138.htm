 away with the angry man&#146;s sullenness which you are showing me by your silence, and recover joy in your heart, peace with the brothers who are of one mind with you, and zeal and anxiety for the continued safety of the Churches of the Lord.&#160; If I were not to make as strenuous efforts on behalf of the Churches as the opponents of sound doctrine make to subvert and utterly destroy them, you may be quite sure that there is nothing to prevent the truth from being swept away and destroyed by its enemies, and my being involved in the condemnation, for not shewing all possible anxiety for the unity of the Churches, with all zeal and eagerness in mutual unanimity and godly agreement.&#160; I exhort you then, drive out of your mind the idea that you need communion with no one else.&#160; To cut one&#146;s self off from connexion with the brethren is not the mark of one who is walking by love, nor yet the fulfilling of the commandment of Christ.&#160; At the same time I do wish you, with all your good intentions, to take into account that the calamities of the war which are now all round about us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2235"></A><A HREF="#fn_2235"><FONT SIZE="1">2236</FONT></A>
 may one day be at our own doors, and if we too, like all the rest, have our share of outrage, we shall not find any even to sympathise with us, because in the hour of our prosperity we refused to give our share of sympathy to the wronged.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ix.lxvi-p4"></A> Atarbius is recognised as bishop of Neoc&aelig;sarea, partly on the evidence of the Codices Coislinanus and Medic&aelig;us, which describe him as of Neoc&aelig;sarea, partly on a comparison of <i>Letters</i> lxv. and cxxvi., addressed to him, with the circumstances of the unnamed bishop of Neoc&aelig;sarea referred to in <i>Letter</i> ccx.&#160; Moreover (<i>cf</i>. Bp. Lightfoot, D.C.B. i. 179) at the Council of Constantinople he represented the province of Pontus Polemoniacus, of which Neoc&aelig;sarea was metropolis.&#160; On the authority of an allusion in <i>Letter</i> ccx. sec. 4, Atarbius is supposed to be a kinsman of Basil.</p>
