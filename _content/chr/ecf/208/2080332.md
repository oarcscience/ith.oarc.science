id="fr_3141"></span>[3142](#fn_3141) </span>

<span id="ix.cclx-p3"></span>To the monks Palladius and Innocent.

<span id="ix.cclx-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclx-p4.1"></span>From</span> your affection for me you ought to
be able to conjecture my affection for you.  I have always desired to be
a herald of peace, and, when I fail in my object, I am grieved.  How
could it be otherwise?  I cannot feel angry with any one for this
reason, because I know that the blessing of peace has long ago been
withdrawn from us.  If the responsibility for division lies with others,
may the Lord grant that those who cause dissension may cease to do so. 
I cannot even ask that your visits to me may be frequent.  You have
therefore no reason to excuse yourselves on this score.  I am well aware
that men who have embraced the life of labour, and always provide with
their own hands the necessities of life, cannot be long away from home;
but, wherever you are, remember me, and pray for me that no cause of
disturbance may dwell in my heart, and that I may be at peace with
myself and with God.
