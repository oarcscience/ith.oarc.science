id="fr_3118"></span>[3119](#fn_3118) </span>

<span id="ix.cclv-p3"></span>*To Pelagius,* <span
id="fr_3119"></span>[3120](#fn_3119) *bishop of the Syrian Laodicea.*

<span id="ix.cclv-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclv-p5.1"></span>May</span> the Lord grant me once again in
person to behold your true piety and to supply in actual intercourse all
that is wanting in my letter.  I am behindhand in beginning to write and
must needs make many excuses.  But we have with us the well beloved and
reverend brother Sanctissimus, the presbyter.  He will tell you
everything, both our news and the news of the West.  You will be cheered
by what you hear; but when he tells you of the troubles in which we are
involved he will perhaps add some distress and anxiety to that which
already besets your kindly soul.  Yet it is not to no purpose that
affliction should be felt by you, able as you are to move the Lord. 
Your anxiety will turn to our gain, and I know that we shall receive
succour from God as long as we have the aid of your prayers.  Pray, too,
with me for release from my anxieties, and ask for some increase in my
bodily strength; then the Lord will prosper me on my way to the
fulfilment of my desires and to a sight of your excellency.
