<p class="c21"><a name="ix.cclxxx-p5"></A>I do not hesitate therefore to entrust to this brother the accompanying letter:&#160; I know that he will meet with all that he wishes, and that you will count me but as a benefactor in furnishing occasion for the gratification of your kind inclinations.&#160; He craves your advocacy.&#160; His cause he will explain in person, if you but deign to regard him with a favourable eye, and embolden him to speak freely in the presence of so august an authority.&#160; Accept my assurance that any kindness shewn to him, I shall regard as personal to myself.&#160; His special reason for leaving Tyana and coming to me was the high value he attached to the presentation of a letter written by myself in support of his application.&#160; That he may not be disappointed of his hope; that I may continue in the enjoyment of your consideration; that your interest in all that is good may, in this present matter, find scope for its full exercise&#8212;are the <A NAME="page_312"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 312</FONT></A> <a name="ix.cclxxx-Page_312"></A>grounds on which I crave a gracious reception for him, and a place amongst those nearest to you.</p>
