id="ix.ccxxi-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXX. <span

<span id="ix.ccxxi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxxi-p5.1"></span>The</span> Lord has given great consolation to
all who are deprived of personal intercourse in allowing them to
communicate by letter.  By this means, it is true, we cannot learn the
express image of the body, but we can learn the disposition of the very
soul.  Thus on the present occasion, when I had received the letter of
your reverences, I at the same moment recognised you, and took your love
towards me into my heart, and needed no long time to create intimacy
with you.  The disposition shewn in your letter was quite enough to
enkindle in me affection for the beauty of your soul.  And, besides your
letter, excellent as it was, I had a yet plainer proof of how things are
with you from <span id="page_261">p. 261</span> <span
id="ix.ccxxi-Page_261"></span>the amiability of the brethren who have
been the means of communication between us.  The well-beloved and
reverend presbyter Acacius, has told me much in addition to what you
have written, and has brought before my eyes the conflict you have to
keep up day by day, and the stoutness of the stand you are making for
the true religion.  He has thus so moved my admiration, and roused in me
so earnest a desire of enjoying the good qualities in you, that I do
pray the Lord that a time may come when I may know you and yours by
personal experience.  He has told me of the exactitude of those of you
who are entrusted with the ministry of the altar, and moreover of the
harmonious agreement of all the people, and the generous character and
genuine love towards God of the magistrates and chief men of your city. 
I consequently congratulate the Church on consisting of such members,
and pray that spiritual peace may be given to you in yet greater
abundance, to the end that in quieter times you may derive enjoyment
from your labours in the day of affliction.  For sufferings that are
painful while they are being experienced are naturally often remembered
with pleasure.  For the present I beseech you not to faint.  Do not
despair because your troubles follow so closely one upon another.  Your
crowns are near:  the help of the Lord is near.  Do not let all you have
hitherto undergone go for nothing; do not nullify a struggle which has
been famous over all the world.  Human life is but of brief duration. 
“All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of
the field.…The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our
God shall stand for ever.” <span id="fr_2869"></span>[2870](#fn_2869)  
Let us hold fast to the commandment that abideth, and despise the
unreality that passeth away.  Many Churches have been cheered by your
example.  In calling new champions into the field you have won for
yourselves a great reward, though you knew it not.  The Giver of the
prize is rich, and is able to reward you not unworthily for your brave
deeds.
