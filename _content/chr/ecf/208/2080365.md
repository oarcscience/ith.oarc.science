<span id="ix.ccxciii-p1"></span> <span class="c18"><span
id="ix.ccxciii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXCII.</span>

<span id="ix.ccxciii-p2"></span>To Palladius.

<span id="ix.ccxciii-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxciii-p3.1"></span>The</span> one-half of my desire has God
fulfilled in the interview He granted me with our fair sister, your
wife.  The other half He is able to accomplish; and so with the sight of
your excellency I shall render my full thanks to God.

<span id="ix.ccxciii-p4"></span>And I am the more desirous of seeing
you, now that I hear you have been adorned with that great ornament, the
clothing of immortality, which clokes our mortality, and puts out of
sight the death of the flesh; by virtue of which the corruptible is
swallowed up in incorruption.

<span id="ix.ccxciii-p5"></span>Thus God of His goodness has now
alienated you from sin, united you to Himself, has opened the doors of
Heaven, and pointed out the paths that lead to heavenly bliss.  I
entreat you therefore by that wisdom wherein you excel all other men,
that you receive the divine favour circumspectly, proving a faithful
guardian of this treasure, as the repository of this royal gift, keeping
watch over it with all carefulness.  Preserve this seal of righteousness
unsullied, that so you may stand before God, shining in the brightness
of the Saints.  Let no spot or wrinkle defile the pure robe of
immortality; but keep holiness in all your members, as having put on
Christ.  “For,” it is said, “as many of you as have been baptized into
Christ, have put on Christ.” <span id="fr_3257"></span>[3258](#fn_3257)
  Wherefore let all your members be holy as becomes their investment in
a raiment of holiness and light.
