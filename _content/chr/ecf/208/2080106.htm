Naz.&#160; He was an important lay compatriot of Basil.&#160; Tillemont was of opinion that the dear brother Gregory referred to in this letter is Gregory of Nyssa; but Maran points out that the events referred to are the same as those described in <i>Letter</i> xxxii., and supposes the word <i>episcopus</i> to have been inserted by a commentator.</p>
