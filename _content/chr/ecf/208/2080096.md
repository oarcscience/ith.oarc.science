id="ix.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Letter XXIII. <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976) </span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p3"></span>*To a Solitary*.

<span id="ix.xxiv-p4"></span>A <span class="c14"><span
id="ix.xxiv-p4.1"></span>certain</span> man, as he says, on condemning
the vanity of this life, and perceiving that its joys are ended here,
since they only provide material for eternal fire and then quickly pass
away, has come to me with the desire of separating from this wicked and
miserable life, of abandoning the pleasures of the flesh, and of
treading for the future a road which leads to the mansions of the Lord. 
Now if he is sincerely firm in his truly blessed purpose, and has in his
soul the glorious and laudable passion, loving the Lord his God with all
his heart, with all his strength, and with all his mind, it is necessary
for your reverence to show him the difficulties and distresses of the
strait and narrow way, and establish him in the hope of the good things
which are as yet unseen, but are laid up in promise for all that are
worthy of the Lord.  I therefore write to entreat your incomparable
perfection in Christ, if it be possible to mould his character, and,
without me, to bring about his renunciation according to what is
pleasing to God, and to see that he receive elementary instruction in
accordance with what has been decided by the Holy Fathers, and <span
id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span id="ix.xxiv-Page_130"></span>put forth
by them in writing.  See too that he have put before him all things that
are essential to ascetic discipline, and that so he may be introduced to
the life, after having accepted, of his own accord, the labours
undergone for religion’s sake, subjected himself to the Lord’s easy
yoke, adopted a conversation in imitation of Him Who for our sakes
became poor <span id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977) and took flesh,
and may run without fail to the prize of his high calling, and receive
the approbation of the Lord.  He is wishful to receive here the crown of
God’s loves, but I have put him off, because I wish, in conjunction with
your reverence, to anoint him for such struggles, and to appoint over
him one of your number whom he may select to be his trainer, training
him nobly, and making him by his constant and blessed care a tried
wrestler, wounding and overthrowing the prince of the darkness of this
world, and the spiritual powers of iniquity, with whom, as the blessed
Apostle says, is “our wrestling.” <span
id="fr_1978"></span>[1979](#fn_1978)   What I wish to do in conjunction
with you, let your love in Christ do without me.
