id="ix.cccvii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCCVI.</span>

<span id="ix.cccvii-p2"></span>*To the Governor of Sebasteia*. <span
id="fr_3261"></span>[3262](#fn_3261)

<span id="ix.cccvii-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccvii-p4.1"></span>I am</span> aware that your excellency is
favourably receiving my letters, and I understand why.  You love all
that is good; you are <span id="page_319">p. 319</span> <span
id="ix.cccvii-Page_319"></span>ready in doing kindnesses.  So whenever I
give you the opportunity of shewing your magnanimity, you are eager for
my letters, because you know that they furnish an occasion for good
deeds.  Now, once more, behold an occasion for your shewing all the
signs of rectitude, and at the same time for the public exhibition of
your virtues!  Certain persons have come from Alexandria for the
discharge of a necessary duty which is due from all men to the dead. 
They ask your excellency to give orders that it may be permitted them to
have conveyed away, under official sanction, the corpse of a relative
who departed this life at Sebasteia, while the troops were quartered
there.  They further beg that, as far as possible, aid may be given them
for travelling at the public expense, so that, of your bounty, they may
find some help and solace in their long journey.  The tidings of this
will travel as far as to great Alexandria, and will convey thither the
report of your excellency’s astonishing kindness.  This you well
understand without my mentioning it.  I shall add gratitude for this one
more favour to that which I feel for all which you have done me.
