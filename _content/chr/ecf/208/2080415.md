id="ix.cccxliii-p1.1"></span>Letter CCCXLVIII.</span>

<span id="ix.cccxliii-p2"></span>Basil to Libanius.

<span id="ix.cccxliii-p3"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cccxliii-p3.1"></span>If</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="ix.cccxliii-p3.2"></span>γριπίζειν</span> is the same thing as to
gain, and this is the meaning of the phrase which your sophistic
ingenuity has got from the depths of Plato, consider, my dear sir, who
is the more hard to be got from, I who am thus impaled <span
id="fr_3280"></span>[3281](#fn_3280) by your epistolary skill, or the
tribe of Sophists, whose craft is to make money out of their words. 
What bishop ever imposed tribute by his words?  What bishop ever made
his disciples pay taxes?  It is you who make your words marketable, as
confectioners make honey-cakes.  See how you have made the old man leap
and bound!  However, to you who make such a fuss about your
declamations, I have ordered as many rafters to be supplied as there
were fighters at Thermopylæ, <span id="fr_3281"></span>[3282](#fn_3281)
all of goodly length, and, as Homer has it, “long-shadowing,” <span
id="fr_3282"></span>[3283](#fn_3282) which the sacred Alphæus has
promised to restore. <span id="fr_3283"></span>[3284](#fn_3283)
