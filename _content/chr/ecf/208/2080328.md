<span id="ix.cclvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclvi-p5.1"></span>Would</span> that it were possible for me to
write to your reverence every day!  For ever since I have had experience
of your affection I have had great desire to converse with you, or, if
this be impossible, at least to communicate with you by letter, that I
may tell you my own news and learn in what state you are.  Yet we have
not what we wish but what the Lord gives, and this we ought to receive
with gratitude.  I have therefore thanked the holy God for giving me an
opportunity for writing to your reverence on the arrival of our very
well beloved and reverend brother Sanctissimus, the presbyter.  He has
had considerable trouble in accomplishing his journey, and will tell you
with accuracy all that he has learnt in the West.  For all these things
we ought to thank the Lord and to beseech Him to give us too the same
peace and that we may freely receive one another.  Receive all the
brethren in Christ in my name.
