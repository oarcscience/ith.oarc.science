id="ix.ccxlvi-p1.1"></span>Letter CCXLV. <span
id="fr_3080"></span>[3081](#fn_3080) </span>

<span id="ix.ccxlvi-p3"></span>*To Theophilus the Bishop*. <span
id="fr_3081"></span>[3082](#fn_3081)

<span id="ix.ccxlvi-p5"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.ccxlvi-p5.1"></span>It</span> is some time since I received your
letter, but I waited to be able to reply by some fit person; that so the
bearer of my answer might supply whatever might be wanting in it.  Now
there has arrived our much beloved and very reverend brother Strategius,
and I have judged it well to make use of his services, both as knowing
my mind and able to convey <span id="fr_3082"></span>[3083](#fn_3082)
news of me with due propriety and reverence.  Know, therefore, my
beloved and honoured friend, that I highly value my affection for you,
and am not conscious so far as the disposition of my heart goes, of
having at any time failed in it, although I have had many serious causes
of reasonable complaint.  But I have decided to weigh the good against
the bad, as in a balance, and to add my own mind where the better
inclines.  Now changes have been made by those who should least of all
have allowed anything of the kind.  Pardon me, therefore, for I have not
changed my mind, if I have shifted any side, or rather I should say, I
shall still be on the same side, but there are others who are
continually changing it, and are now openly deserting to the foe.  You
yourself know what a value I put on their communion, so long as they
were of the sound party.  If now I refuse to follow these, and shun all
who think with them, I ought fairly to be forgiven.  I put truth and my
own salvation before everything.
