<span id="vi.i.viii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vi.i.viii-p1.1"></span>VIII.—St. Basil and Eustathius.</span>

<span id="vi.i.viii-p2"></span>It was Basil’s doom to suffer through his
friendships.  If the fault lay with himself in the case of Gregory, the
same cannot be said of his rupture with Eustathius of Sebaste.  If in
this connexion fault can be laid to his charge at all, it was the fault
of entering into intimacy with an unworthy man.  In the earlier days of
the retirement in Pontus the austerities of Eustathius outweighed in
Basil’s mind any suspicions of his unorthodoxy. <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206)   Basil delighted in his society,
spent days and nights in sweet converse with him, and introduced him to
his mother and the happy family circle at Annesi. <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207)   And no doubt under the ascendency of
Basil, Eustathius, always ready to be all things to all men who might be
for the time in power and authority, would appear as a very orthodox
ascetic.  Basil likens him to the Ethiopian of immutable blackness, and
the leopard who cannot change his spots. <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208)   But in truth his skin at various
periods shewed every shade which could serve his purpose, and his spots
shifted and changed colour with every change in his surroundings. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209)   He is the patristic Proteus.  There
must have been something singularly winning in his more than human
attractiveness. <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210)   But he signed
almost every creed that went about for signature in his lifetime. <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211)   He was consistent only in
inconsistency.  It was long ere Basil was driven to withdraw his
confidence and regard, although his constancy to Eustathius raised in
not a few, and notably in Theodotus of Nicopolis, the metropolitan of
Armenia, doubts as to Basil’s soundness in the faith.  When Basil was in
Armenia in 373, a creed was drawn up, in consultation with Theodotus, to
be offered to Eustathius for signature.  It consisted of the Nicene
confession, with certain additions relating to the Macedonian
controversy. <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212)   Eustathius
signed, together with Fronto and Severus.  But, when another meeting
with other bishops was arranged, he violated his pledge to attend.  He
wrote on the subject as though it were one of only small
importance. <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213)   Eusebius
endeavoured, but endeavoured in vain, to make peace. <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214)   Eustathius renounced communion with
Basil, and at last, when an open attack on the archbishop seemed the
paying game, he published an old letter of Basil’s to Apollinarius,
written by “layman to layman,” many years before, and either introduced,
or appended, heretical expressions of Apollinarius, which were made to
pass as Basil’s.  In his virulent hostility he was aided, if not
instigated, by Demosthenes the prefect’s vicar, probably Basil’s old
opponent at Cæsarea in 372. <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215)  
His duplicity and slanders roused Basil’s indignant denunciation. <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216)   Unhappily they were not everywhere
recognized as calumnies.  Among the bitterest of Basil’s trials was the
failure to credit him with honour and orthodoxy on the part of those
<span id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span> <span
id="vi.i.viii-Page_xxviii"></span>from whom he might have expected
sympathy and support.  An earlier instance of this is the feeling shewn
at the banquet at Nazianzus already referred to. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217)   In later days he was cruelly
troubled by the unfriendliness of his old neighbours at
Neocæsarea, <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218) and this alienation
would be the more distressing inasmuch as Atarbius, the bishop of that
see, appears to have been Basil’s kinsman. <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219)   He was under the suspicion of
Sabellian unsoundness.  He slighted and slandered Basil on several
apparently trivial pretexts, and on one occasion hastened from Nicopolis
for fear of meeting him. <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220)   He
expressed objection to supposed novelties introduced into the Church of
Cæsarea, to the mode of psalmody practiced there, and to the
encouragement of ascetic life. <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221)  
Basil did his utmost to win back the Neocæsareans from their heretical
tendencies and to their old kindly sentiments towards himself.

<span id="vi.i.viii-p19"></span>The clergy of Pisidia and Pontus, where
Eustathius had been specially successful in alienating the district of
Dazimon, were personally visited and won back to communion. <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222)   But Atarbius and the Neocæsareans
were deaf to all appeal, and remained persistently irreconcilable. <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223)   On his visiting the old home at
Annesi, where his youngest brother Petrus was now residing, in 375, the
Neocæsareans were thrown into a state of almost ludicrous panic.  They
fled as from a pursuing enemy. <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224)  
They accused Basil of seeking to win their regard and support from
motives of the pettiest ambition, and twitted him with travelling into
their neighbourhood uninvited. <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225)
