id="fr_3243"></span>[3244](#fn_3243) </span>

<span id="ix.cclxxxvi-p3"></span>Without Address.

<span id="ix.cclxxxvi-p4"></span><span class="c14"><span
id="ix.cclxxxvi-p4.1"></span>The</span> hearer of this letter is one on
whom rests the care of our Church and the management of its property—our
beloved son.

<span id="ix.cclxxxvi-p5"></span>Deign to grant him freedom of speech on
those points that are referred to your holiness, and attention to the
expression of his own views; so shall our Church at length recover
herself, and henceforth be released from this many-headed Hydra.

<span id="ix.cclxxxvi-p6"></span>Our property is our poverty; so much so
that we are ever in search of one to relieve us of it; for the expenses
of the Church property amount to more than any profit that she derives
from it.
