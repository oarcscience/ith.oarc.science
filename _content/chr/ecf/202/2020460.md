Meletius and Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch. Their Oath respecting the
Episcopal See*.

<span id="iii.xii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xii.iii-p2.1"></span>In</span> consequence of this law, Meletius
returned about this period to Antioch in Syria; and his presence gave
rise to great contention among the people. <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[1519](#fn_1518) Paulinus, whom Valens, from
veneration for his piety, had not ventured to banish, was still alive.
The partisans of Meletius, therefore, proposed his association with
Paulinus, who condemned the ordination of Meletius, because it had been
conferred by Arian bishops; and yet the supporters of Meletius went
forward by force into the work they had devised; for they were not few
in number, and so placed Meletius on the episcopal throne in one of the
suburban churches. The mutual animosity of the two parties increased,
and sedition was expected, had not a remarkable plan for the restoration
of concord prevailed. For it seemed best, to take oaths from those who
were considered eligible, or who were expected to occupy the episcopal
see of that place. Of these there were five besides Flavian. These
promised that they would neither strive for, nor accept the episcopate
should an ordination take place among them during the life of Paulinus
and Meletius, and that in the event of the decease of either of these
great men, the other alone should succeed to the bishopric. On their
ratifying this promise with oaths, unanimity was restored among almost
all the people; a few of the Luciferites still diverged because Meletius
had been ordained by heretics. On the termination of this contest,
Meletius proceeded to Constantinople, where many other bishops had
assembled together to deliberate on the necessity of translating Gregory
from the bishopric of Nazianzen to that of this city.
