<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*The Emperor prepared a
Public Table for the Synod, after inviting its Members to
Constantinople, and honoring them with Gifts, he exhorted all to be of
One Mind, and forwarded to Alexandria and every other place the Decrees
of the Holy Synod.*

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xxv-p2.1"></span>At</span> the very time that these decrees
were passed by the council, the twentieth anniversary <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[1138](#fn_1137) of the reign of Constantine was
celebrated; for it was a Roman custom to have a feast on the tenth year
of every reign. The emperor, therefore, thought it to be opportune, and
invited the Synod to the festival, and presented suitable gifts to them;
and when they prepared to return home, he called them all together, and
exhorted them to be of one mind about the faith and at peace among
themselves, so that no dissensions might henceforth creep in among them.
After many other similar exhortations, he concluded by commanding them
to be diligent in prayer, and always to supplicate God for himself, his
children, and the empire, and after he had thus addressed those who had
come to Nicæa, he bade them farewell. He wrote to the churches in every
city, in order that he might make plain to those who had not been
present, what had been rectified by the Synod; and especially to the
Church of Alexandria he wrote more than this; urging them to lay aside
all dissent, and to be harmonious in the faith issued by the Synod; for
this could be nothing else than the judgment of God, since it was
established by the Holy Spirit from the concurrence of so many and such
illustrious high priests, and approved after accurate inquiry and test
of all the doubtful points.
