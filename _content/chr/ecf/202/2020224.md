id="ii.x.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Cyril succeeds Theophilus
Bishop of Alexandria.*

<span id="ii.x.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.vii-p2.1"></span>Shortly</span> afterwards Theophilus bishop of
Alexandria having fallen into a lethargic state, died on the 15th of
October, <span id="fr_920"></span>[921](#fn_920) in the ninth consulate
of Honorius, and the fifth of Theodosius. A great contest immediately
arose about the appointment of a successor, some seeking to place
Timothy the archdeacon in the episcopal chair; and others desiring
Cyril, who was a nephew of Theophilus. A tumult having arisen on this
account among the people, Abundantius, the commander of the troops in
Egypt, took sides with Timothy. \[Yet the partisans of Cyril
triumphed.\] <span id="fr_921"></span>[922](#fn_921) Whereupon on the
third day after the death of Theophilus, Cyril came into possession of
the episcopate, with greater power than Theophilus had ever exercised.
For from that time the bishopric of Alexandria went beyond the limits of
its sacerdotal functions, and assumed the administration of secular
matters. <span id="fr_922"></span>[923](#fn_922) Cyril immediately
therefore shut up the churches of the Novatians at Alexandria, and took
possession of all their consecrated vessels and ornaments; and then
stripped their bishop Theopemptus of all that he had.
