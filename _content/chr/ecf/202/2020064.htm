  on fire, and did not manifest sufficient zeal in promoting the interests of their party.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">284</FONT></A>
  They therefore inducted George into his see, who was a native of Cappadocia, and had acquired the reputation of being an able advocate of their tenets. </p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ii.v.xiv-p2"></A>There is an error here, repeated also by Sozomen (III. 7), but corrected by Theodoret, <i>H. E.</i> II. 4 and 12, without the mention of the names of his predecessors. The error consists in the statement that Gregory was ejected at this time. It appears that he remained in his position until the Council of Sardica, by which he was deposed and excommunicated. He survived this council by six months.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="ii.v.xiv-p5"></A>This is the same Gregory that is mentioned in ch. 10 as violently put into possession of the see of Alexandria by the Arians. It is evident that they were disappointed in him.</p>
