<span id="ii.vii.xxix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*Damasus ordained
Bishop of Rome. Sedition and Loss of Life caused by the Rivalry of
Ursinus.*

<span id="ii.vii.xxix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xxix-p2.1"></span>While</span> the emperor Valentinian
governed in peace, and interfered with no sect, Damasus after Liberius
undertook the administration of the bishopric at Rome; <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657) whereupon a great disturbance was
caused on the following account. <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658)
A certain Ursinus, a deacon of that church, had been nominated among
others when the election of a bishop took place; as Damasus <span
id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659) was preferred, this Ursinus, unable to
bear the disappointment of his hopes, held schismatic assemblies apart
from the church, and even induced certain bishops of little distinction
to ordain him in secret. This ordination was made, not in a
church, <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660) but in a retired place
called the Palace of Sicine, whereupon dissension arose among the
people; their disagreement being not about any article of faith or
heresy, but simply as to who should be bishop. Hence frequent conflicts
arose, insomuch that many lives were sacrificed in this contention; and
many of the clergy as well as laity were punished on that account by
Maximin, the prefect of the city. Thus was Ursinus obliged to desist
from his pretensions at that time, and those who were minded to follow
him were reduced to order.

Damasus as bishop of Rome in the third year of Valentinian’s reign, i.e.
in 367. Cf. also Clinton, *Fasti Rom. Ann.* 367.
