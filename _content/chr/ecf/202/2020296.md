<span id="iii.vi.xx-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XX</span>.—*After having given
Audience to both Parties, the Emperor condemned the Followers of Arius
and banished them*.

<span id="iii.vi.xx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.xx-p2.1"></span>The</span> next debate by the priests turned
upon doctrine. <span id="fr_1122"></span>[1123](#fn_1122) The emperor
gave patient attention to the speeches of both parties; he applauded
those who spoke well, rebuked those who displayed a tendency to
altercation, and according to his apprehension of what he heard, for he
was not wholly unpracticed in the Greek tongue, he addressed himself
with kindness to each one. Finally all the priests agreed with one
another and conceded that the Son is consubstantial with the Father. At
the commencement of the conference there were but seventeen who praised
the opinion of Arius, but eventually the majority of these yielded
assent to the general view. To this judgment the emperor likewise
deferred, for he regarded the unanimity of the conference to be a divine
approbation; and he ordained that any one who should be rebellious
thereto, should forthwith be sent into banishment, as guilty of
endeavoring to overthrow the Divine definitions. I had thought it
necessary to reproduce the very document concerning the matter, as an
example of the truth, in order that posterity might possess in a fixed
and clear form the symbol of the faith which proved pacificatory at the
time but since some pious friends, who understood such matters,
recommended that these truths ought to be spoken of and heard by the
initiated and their initiators <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[1124](#fn_1123) only, I agreed with their council;
for it is not unlikely that some of the uninitiated may read this book.
While I have concealed such of the prohibited material as I ought to
keep silent about, I have not altogether left the reader ignorant of the
opinions held by the synod.
