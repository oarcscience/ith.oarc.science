succeeded Liberius then presided over the church at Rome. Cyril was
still in possession of that at Jerusalem. The Antiochian church, as we
have stated, was divided into three parts: for the Arians had chosen
Dorotheus as the successor of their bishop Euzoïus; while one portion of
the rest was under the government of Paulinus, and the others ranged
themselves with Melitius, who had been recalled from exile. Lucius,
although absent, having been compelled to leave Alexandria, yet
maintained the episcopal authority among the Arians of that city; the
Homoousians there being headed by Timothy, who succeeded Peter. At
Constantinople Demophilus the successor of Eudoxius presided over the
Arian faction, and was in possession of the churches; but those who were
averse to communion with him held their assemblies apart. <span
