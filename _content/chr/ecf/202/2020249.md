<span id="ii.x.xxxii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII</span>.—*Of the Presbyter
Anastasius, by whom the Faith of Nestorius was perverted.*

<span id="ii.x.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxii-p2.1"></span>Nestorius</span> had an associate whom he
had brought from Antioch, a presbyter named Anastasius; for this man he
had the highest esteem, and consulted him in the management of his most
important affairs. This Anastasius preaching one day in the church said,
‘Let no one call Mary *Theotocos:* <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[1002](#fn_1001) for Mary was but a woman; <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[1003](#fn_1002) and it is impossible that God
should be born of a woman.’ These words created a great sensation, and
troubled many both of the clergy and laity; they having been heretofore
taught to acknowledge Christ as God, and by no means to separate his
humanity from his divinity on account of the economy of incarnation,
heeding the voice of the apostle when he said, ‘Yea, though we have
known Christ after the flesh; yet now henceforth know we him no
more.’ <span id="fr_1003"></span>[1004](#fn_1003) And again, ‘Wherefore,
leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on unto
perfection.’ <span id="fr_1004"></span>[1005](#fn_1004) While great
offense was taken in the church, as we have said, at what was thus
propounded, Nestorius, eager to establish Anastasius’ proposition—for he
did not wish to have the man who was esteemed by himself found guilty of
blasphemy—delivered several public dis<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>
<span id="ii.x.xxxii-Page_171"></span>courses on the subject, in which
he assumed a controversial attitude, and totally rejected the epithet
*Theotocos.* Wherefore the controversy on the subject being taken in one
spirit by some and in another by others, the discussion which ensued
divided the church, and resembled the struggle of combatants in the
dark, all parties uttering the most confused and contradictory
assertions. Nestorius thus acquired the reputation among the masses of
asserting the blasphemous dogma that the Lord is a mere man, and
attempting to foist on the Church the dogmas of Paul of Samosata and
Photinus; and so great a clamor was raised by the contention that it was
deemed requisite to convene a general council to take cognizance of the
matter in dispute. Having myself perused the writings of Nestorius, I
have found him an unlearned man and shall candidly express the
conviction of my own mind concerning him: and as in entire freedom from
personal antipathies, I have already alluded to his faults, I shall in
like manner be unbiassed by the criminations of his adversaries, to
derogate from his merits. I cannot then concede that he was either a
follower of Paul of Samosata or of Photinus, or that he denied the
Divinity of Christ: but he seemed scared at the term *Theotocos,* as
though it were some terrible phantom. <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1006](#fn_1005) The fact is, the causeless alarm he
manifested on this subject just exposed his extreme ignorance: for being
a man of natural fluency as a speaker, he was considered well educated,
but in reality he was disgracefully illiterate. In fact he contemned the
drudgery of an accurate examination of the ancient expositors: and,
puffed up with his readiness of expression, he did not give his
attention to the ancients, but thought himself the greatest of all. Now
he was evidently unacquainted with the fact that in the *First Catholic
epistle of John* it was written in the ancient copies, <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[1007](#fn_1006) ‘Every spirit that separates Jesus,
is not of God.’ The mutilation of this passage <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1008](#fn_1007) is attributable to those who
desired to separate the Divine nature from the human economy: or to use
the very language of the early interpreters, some persons have corrupted
this epistle, aiming at ‘separating the manhood of Christ from his
Deity.’ But the humanity is united to the Divinity in the Saviour, so as
to constitute not two persons but one only. Hence it was that the
ancients, emboldened by this testimony, scrupled not to style Mary
*Theotocos.* For thus Eusebius Pamphilus in his third book of the Life
of Constantine <span id="fr_1008"></span>[1009](#fn_1008) writes in
these terms:

<span id="ii.x.xxxii-p11"></span>‘And in fact “God with us” submitted to
be born for our sake; and the place of his nativity is by the Hebrews
called Bethlehem. Wherefore the devout empress Helena adorned the place
of accouchement of the God-bearing virgin with the most splendid
monuments, decorating that sacred spot with the richest ornaments.’

<span id="ii.x.xxxii-p12"></span>Origen also in the first volume of his
*Commentaries* on the apostle’s epistle to the Romans, <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[1010](#fn_1009) gives an ample exposition of the
sense in which the term *Theotocos* is used. It is therefore obvious
that Nestorius had very little acquaintance with the treatises of the
ancients, and for that reason, as I observed, objected to the word only:
for that he does not assert Christ to be a mere man, as Photinus did or
Paul of Samosata, his own published homilies fully demonstrate. In these
discourses he nowhere destroys the proper personality <span
id="fr_1010"></span>[1011](#fn_1010) of the Word of God; but on the
contrary invariably maintains that he has an essential and distinct
personality and existence. Nor does he ever deny his subsistence as
Photinus and the Samosatan did, and as the Manichæans and followers of
Montanus have also dared to do. Such in fact I find Nestorius, both from
having myself read his own works, and from the assurances of his
admirers. But this idle contention of his has produced no slight ferment
in the religious world.
