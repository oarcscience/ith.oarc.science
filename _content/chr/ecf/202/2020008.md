<span id="ii.iii.iv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>IV. History of Socrates’ Work.</span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p2"></span>A. *Uses made before the First Printed
Edition of the Greek Text.*

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p3.1"></span>Socrates’</span> *Ecclesiastical History* was
used, according to the best authorities, by Sozomen in the composition
of his parallel history. <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102) It was
certainly used by Liberatus, the Carthaginian deacon, in his *Breviarium
caussæ Nestorianorum et Eutychianorum*, and by Theodorus Anagnostes
(Lector) in his *Ecclesiastical History*. <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103) It was also quoted in the second
Council of Nicæa, under the name of Rufinus, and also under its author’s
name. <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104)

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p7"></span>Epiphanius, surnamed Scholasticus,
translated the history of Socrates, together with those of Sozomen and
Theodoret, under the auspices of Cassiodorus, about the beginning of the
sixth century. This translation, under the name of *Historiæ
Ecclesiasticæ Tripartitæ*, consists of twelve books, and was printed at
Paris, without date, by Regnault in 8vo; afterwards also at Bâle in
1523, 1528, 1533, 1539, and 1568. It was revised by <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p7.1"></span>Beatus Rhenanus</span>, and
published in Frankfort on the Main in 1588, together with the history of
Eusebius, which was translated and continued by Rufinus. It is also
found in the new edition of Cassiodorus printed at Rouen by <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p7.2"></span>Jo</span>. <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p7.3"></span>Garetius</span> in 1679 and
in Venice, 1729. It served as a basis for a French translation by <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p7.4"></span>Ægidius Gourlinus</span>
(Gille Gourlin), published in Paris in 1538 (cited by <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p7.5"></span>Cyaneus</span>), and of a
German translation by <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p7.6"></span>Caspar Hedio</span> at Strasburg, 1545.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p8"></span>B. *Editions.*

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p9"></span>There are two independent editions of
Socrates’ *Ecclesiastical History*, each of which has served as a basis
for reprints, secondary editions, and translations. These are:

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p10"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p10.1"></span>I. Eusebii Pamphili</span>: *Hist. EccI.*
LL. X.; ejd. *de Vita Constantini* LL. V.; <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p10.2"></span>Socratis</span> *Hist. Eccl.* LL. VII.;
<span class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p10.3"></span>Theodoreti</span>
Episc. Cyrensis *Hist. EccI.* LL. V.; *Collectaneum ex hist. eccl.*
<span class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p10.4"></span>Theodori
Lectoris</span> LL. II.; <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p10.5"></span>Hermiæ Sozomeni</span> *Hist. EccI.* LL.
IX.; <span class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p10.6"></span>Evagrii</span>
*Hist. Eccl.* LL. VI. Lut. Paris, ex off. Rob. Stephani 1544 pridie Cal.
Jul.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p11"></span>a. Upon this edition is based a Latin
translation by <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p11.1"></span>Wolfgang Musculus</span>, Bâle 1544, 1549,
1557, 1594, and one by <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p11.2"></span>J. J. Christophorson</span>, bishop of
Chichester, Paris 1571, Cologne 1581, Bâle 1570; with notes by <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p11.3"></span>Grynæus</span> and by
<span class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p11.4"></span>Henricus Petri
1611</span>; incorporated into the *Bibliotheca Patrum,* ed. Cologne
1618 as Vol. V. and ed. Lyons 1677 as Vol. VII.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p12"></span>b. The Greek text of Stephens and the
Latin translation of Christophorson were published together in Geneva,
1612.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p13"></span>c. An English translation of Socrates’
Ecclesiastical History was made by <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p13.1"></span>Meredith Hanmer</span>, <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105) and is contained in his *Ancient
Ecclesiastical Histories of the first six hundred years after Christ,
written in the Greek tongue by three learned Historiographers, Eusebius,
Socrates and Evagrius.* London 1577. \[This work also contains
Dorotheus’ *Lives of the Prophets, Apostles, and Seventy Disciples*
reprinted in 1585 and 1650.\]

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p15"></span>2. The second independent edition of
Socrates is that which has been received as standard and served as a
basis for all subsequent uses, viz.:

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p16"></span>*Historia Ecclesiastica Socratis,
Scholastici, Hermiæ, Sozomeni,* &c., ed. <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p16.1"></span>Henricus Valesius</span>. Paris 1668.
Valesius ostensibly revised the text of Stephens, but as a matter of
fact he made a new collation of the <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p16.2"></span>ms.</span> used by Stephens, and compared
this with <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p16.3"></span>mss.</span> in the Vatican, so that <span
id="page_xix">p. xix</span> <span id="ii.iii.iv-Page_xix"></span>his
edition amounts to an entirely new work. He also made a new Latin
translation and appended numerous notes. This edition was reprinted in
Mayence in 1677. Its Latin portion was reprinted in Paris also in 1677.
The reprint of Mayence was reproduced under a new title, as if in
Amsterdam in 1675.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p17"></span>a. <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p17.1"></span>Gul. Reading</span> appended additional
notes, and together with the Latin translation of Valesius, published
the work in Cambridge in three vols. 1720. Reading’s edition was
reprinted at Turin in 1746. Valesius’ original edition was again
reprinted in Oxford by <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p17.2"></span>Parker</span> in 1844 and *Cura* <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p17.3"></span>Buckley</span> in London,
also in 1844. It was revised and published in Oxford in 3 vols. by <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p17.4"></span>R. Hussey</span> in 1853,
and again in 1860 and in 1879. Again it was incorporated into <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p17.5"></span>Migne’s</span> *Patrologia
Græca* as Vol. LXVII. (Petit Montrouge) in 1859, and finally the Greek
text alone was revised and published in a single volume by <span
class="c13"><span id="ii.iii.iv-p17.6"></span>William Bright</span> in
Oxford 1878.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p18"></span>b. The translations based on Valesius’
edition exclusive of those in Latin mentioned above are as follows:

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p19"></span>In *French* by <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p19.1"></span>L. Cousin</span>: *<span

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p22"></span>By <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p22.1"></span>S. Parker</span>: *The Ecclesiastical

of the first six centuries of the Christian Era* in 6 vols. \[Socrates
Scholasticus’ *History* forms Vol. III. of this series\]. London, Samuel

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p24"></span>The volume containing Sozomen in this
series bears the name of Walford. The translation of Socrates is
anonymous, but generally ascribed to Walford also. This cannot be a
matter of inference from the appearance of the two historians in the
same series, as Eusebius, also in the same series, is translated by
Crusè. Those who attribute the translation to Walford give no reason for
doing so.
