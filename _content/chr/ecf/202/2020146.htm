<p class="c24"><a name="ii.vii.xxi-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vii.xxi-p2.1"></A>Upon</span> this the Arians, emboldened by their knowledge of the emperor&#146;s religious sentiments, again took courage, and without delay informed him of the circumstance. He was then residing at Antioch. Then indeed Euzo&iuml;us who presided over the Arians of that city, eagerly embracing the favorable opportunity thus presented, begged permission to go to Alexandria, for the purpose of putting Lucius the Arian in possession of the churches there. The emperor acceded to this request, and as speedily as possible Euzo&iuml;us proceeded forthwith to Alexandria, attended by the imperial troops. Magnus, also, the emperor&#146;s treasurer, went with him. Moreover an imperial mandate had been issued to Palladius, the governor of Egypt, enjoining him to aid them with a military force. Wherefore having apprehended Peter, they cast him into prison; and after dispersing the rest of the clergy, they placed Lucius in the episcopal chair.</p>
