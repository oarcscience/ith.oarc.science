<span id="ii.iv.xv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*After the Synod, on the
Death of Alexander, Athanasius is constituted Bishop of Alexandria.*

<span id="ii.iv.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>A little</span> after this, Alexander bishop
of Alexandria having died, <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202)
Athanasius was set over that church. Rufinus relates, that this
\[Athanasius\] when quite a boy, played with others of his own age at a
sacred game: this was an imitation of the priesthood and the order of
consecrated persons. In this game therefore Athanasius was allotted the
episcopal chair, and each of the other lads personated either a
presbyter or a deacon. The children engaged in this sport on the day in
which the memory of the martyr and bishop Peter was celebrated. Now at
that time Alexander bishop of Alexandria happening to pass by, observed
the play in which they were engaged, and having sent for the children,
enquired from them the part each had been assigned in the game,
conceiving that something might be portended by that which had been
done. He then gave directions that the children should be taken to the
church, and instructed in learning, but especially Athanasius; and
having afterwards ordained him deacon on his becoming of adult age, he
brought him to Nicæa to assist him in the disputations there when the
Synod was convened. This account of Athanasius Rufinus has given in his
own writings; nor is it improbable that it took place, for many
transactions of this kind have often occurred. Concerning this matter it
will suffice to have said the above. <span

<span id="ii.iv.xv-p3"></span>Socrates and Sozomen are both mistaken in
putting the death of Alexander and ordination of Athanasius after the
return of Eusebius and Theognis from exile. According to Theodoret (*H.
E.* I. 26), Alexander died a few months after the Council of Nicæa,
hence in 325 <span class="c13"><span
id="ii.iv.xv-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>, and Athanasius succeeded him at
the end of the same year, or at the beginning of the next.
