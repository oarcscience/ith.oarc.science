<span id="ii.vi.xviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*The Emperor
consulting an Oracle, the Demon gives no Response, being awed by the
Nearness of Babylas the Martyr.*

<span id="ii.vi.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.xviii-p2.1"></span>Having</span> ordered that the pagan
temples at Antioch should be opened, he was very eager to obtain an
oracle from *Apollo of Daphne.* But the demon that inhabited the temple
remained silent through fear of his neighbor, Babylas <span
id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537) the martyr; for the coffin which
contained the body of that saint was close by. When the emperor was
informed of this circumstance, he commanded that the coffin should be
immediately <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> <span
id="ii.vi.xviii-Page_89"></span>removed: upon which the Christians of
Antioch, including women and children, transported the coffin from
Daphne to the city, with solemn rejoicings and chanting of psalms. The
psalms <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538) were such as cast
reproach on the gods of the heathen, and those who put confidence in
them and their images.

<span id="ii.vi.xviii-p3"></span>See Euseb. *H. E.* VI. 20 and 39; also
Chrysostom, *de S. Babyl.* According to these authorities Babylas was
bishop of Antioch, succeeding Sabrinus, and was beheaded in prison
during the reign of Decius. His remains were transferred to a church
built over against the temple of Apollo of Daphne (Sozom. V. 19) by
Gallus, Julian’s brother.
