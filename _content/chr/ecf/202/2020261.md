id="ii.x.xliv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLIV</span>.—*Marriage of the Emperor
Valentinian with Eudoxia the Daughter of Theodosius.*

<span id="ii.x.xliv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xliv-p2.1"></span>He</span> had by the empress Eudocia, his
wife, a daughter named Eudoxia. Her his cousin Valentinian, appointed by
him emperor of the West, demanded for himself in marriage. When the
emperor Theodosius had given his assent to this proposal, and they had
consulted with each other as to the place on the frontiers of both
empires, where it would be desirable that the marriage should be
celebrated, it was decided that both parties should go to Thessalonica
(which is about half-way) for this purpose. But Valentinian sent a
message to the effect that he would not give him the trouble of coming,
for that he himself would go to Constantinople. Accordingly, having
secured the Western parts with a sufficient guard, he proceeded thither
on account of his nuptials, which were celebrated in the consulate of
Isidore and Sinator; <span id="fr_1034"></span>[1035](#fn_1034) after
which he returned with his wife into the West. This auspicious event
took place at that time.
