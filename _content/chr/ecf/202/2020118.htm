<p class="c24"><a name="ii.vi.xx-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="ii.vi.xx-p2.1"></A>The</span> emperor in another attempt to molest the Christians exposed his superstition. Being fond of sacrificing, he not only himself delighted in the blood of victims, but considered it an indignity offered to him, if others did not do likewise. And as he found but few persons of this stamp, he sent for the Jews and enquired of them why they abstained from sacrificing, since the law of Moses enjoined it? On their replying that it was not permitted them to do this in any other place than Jerusalem, he immediately ordered them to rebuild Solomon&#146;s temple. Meanwhile he himself proceeded on his expedition against the Persians. The Jews who had been long desirous of obtaining a favorable opportunity for rearing their temple afresh in order that they might therein offer sacrifice, applied themselves very vigorously to the work. Moreover, they conducted themselves with great insolence toward the Christians, and threatened to do them as much mischief, as they had themselves suffered from the Romans. The emperor having ordered that the expenses of this structure should be defrayed out of the public treasury, all things were soon provided, such as timber and stone, burnt brick, clay, lime, and all other materials necessary for building. On this occasion Cyril bishop of Jerusalem, called to mind the prophecy of Daniel, which Christ also in the holy gospels has confirmed, and predicted in the presence of many persons, that the time had indeed come &#145;in which one stone should not be left upon another in that temple,&#146; but that the Saviour&#146;s prophetic declaration&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_539"><FONT SIZE="1">540</FONT></A>
  should have its full accomplishment. Such were the bishop&#146;s words: and on the night following, a mighty earthquake tore up the stones of the old foundations of the temple and dispersed them all together with the adjacent edifices. Terror consequently possessed the Jews on account of the event; and the report of it brought many to the spot who resided at a great distance: when therefore a vast multitude was assembled, another prodigy took place. Fire came down from heaven and consumed all the builders&#146; tools: so that the flames were seen preying upon mallets, irons to smooth and polish stones, saws, hatchets, adzes, in short all the various implements which the workmen had procured as necessary for the undertaking; <A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A> <a name="ii.vi.xx-Page_90"></A>and the fire continued burning among these for a whole day. The Jews indeed were in the greatest possible alarm, and unwillingly confessed Christ, calling him God: yet they did not do his will; but influenced by inveterate prepossessions they still clung to Judaism. Even a third miracle which afterwards happened failed to lead them to a belief of the truth. For the next night luminous impressions of a cross appeared imprinted on their garments, which at daybreak they in vain attempted to rub or wash out. They were therefore &#145;blinded&#146; as the apostle says,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_540"></A><A HREF="#fn_540"><FONT SIZE="1">541</FONT></A>
  and cast away the good which they had in their hands: and thus was the temple, instead of being rebuilt, at that time wholly overthrown. </p>
