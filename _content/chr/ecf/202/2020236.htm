<p class="c24"><a name="ii.x.xix-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="ii.x.xix-p2.1"></A>How</span> the Emperor Theodosius received intelligence of what was done in an incredibly short space of time, and how he was quickly informed of events taking place far away, I shall attempt to explain. For he had the good fortune to possess among his subjects a man endowed with extraordinary energy both of body and mind, named Palladius; who rode so vigorously that he would reach the frontiers of the Roman and Persian dominions in three days,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_955"></A><A HREF="#fn_955"><FONT SIZE="1">956</FONT></A>

The same individual traversed other parts of the world on missions from the emperor with equal celerity: so that an eloquent man once said not unaptly, &#145;This man by his speed proves the vast expanse of the Roman Empire to be little.&#146; The king of the Persians himself was astonished at the expeditious feats which were related to him of this courier: but we must be content with the above details concerning him. </p>

But even if the minimum of 500 miles be taken as a basis, the speed seems almost incredible.</p>
