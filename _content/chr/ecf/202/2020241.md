id="ii.x.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Valentinian a Son of
Constantius and Placidia, Aunt of Theodosius, is proclaimed Emperor.*

<span id="ii.x.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxiv-p2.1"></span>After</span> the usurper’s death, the emperor
Theodosius became very anxious as to whom he should proclaim emperor of
the West. He had a cousin then very young named Valentinian; the son of
his aunt Placidia, daughter of Theodosius the Great, and sister of the
two Augusti Arcadius and Honorius and of that Constantius who had been
proclaimed emperor by Honorius, <span id="fr_968"></span>[969](#fn_968)
and had died after a short reign with him. This cousin he created Cæsar,
and sent into the Western parts, committing the administration of
affairs to his mother Placidia. He himself also hastened towards Italy,
that he might in person both proclaim his cousin emperor, and also being
present among them, endeavor to influence the natives and residents by
his counsels not to submit to usurpers readily. But when he reached
Thessalonica he was prevented from proceeding further by sickness; he
therefore sent forward the imperial crown to his cousin by Helion the
patrician, and he himself returned to Constantinople. But concerning
these matters I deem the narrative here given sufficient.
