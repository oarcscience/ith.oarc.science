id="iii.ix.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*Death of Constans Cæsar.
Occurrences which took place in Rome*.

<span id="iii.ix.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.i-p3.1"></span>Four</span> years after the council of
Sardica, <span id="fr_1281"></span>[1282](#fn_1281) Constans was killed
in Western Gaul. <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1283](#fn_1282) Magnentius,
who had plotted his murder, reduced the entire government of Constans
under his own sway. In the meantime Vetranio was proclaimed emperor at
Sirmium, by the Illyrian troops. Nepotian, the son of the late emperor’s
sister, gathered about him a body of gladiators, and wrangled for the
imperial power, and ancient Rome had the greatest share of these evils.
Nepotian, however, was put to death by the soldiers of Magnentius. <span
id="fr_1283"></span>[1284](#fn_1283) Constantius, finding himself the
sole master of the empire, was proclaimed sole ruler, and hastened to
depose the tyrants. In the meantime, Athanasius, having arrived in
Alexandria, prepared to convene a Synod of the Egyptian bishops, and had
the enactments confirmed which had been passed at Sardica, and in
Palestine, in his favor.
