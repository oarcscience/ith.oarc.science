<span id="ii.vii.xi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*Hail of Extraordinary
Size; and Earthquakes in Bithynia and the Hellespont.*

<span id="ii.vii.xi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.xi-p2.1"></span>On</span> the 2d of June of the following
year, in the consulate <span id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589) of
Lupicin and Jovian, there fell at Constantinople hail of such a size as
would fill a man’s hand. Many affirmed that this hail had fallen as a
consequence of the Divine displeasure, because of the emperor’s having
banished several persons engaged in the sacred ministry, those, that is
to say, who refused to communicate with Eudoxius. <span
id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590) During the same consulate, on the 24th
of August, the emperor Valentinian proclaimed his son Gratian Augustus.
In the next year, <span id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591) when
Valentinian and Valens were a second time consuls, there happened on the
11th of October, an earthquake in Bithynia which destroyed the city of
Nicæa on the eleventh day of October. This was about twelve years after
Nicomedia had been visited by a similar catastrophe. Soon afterwards the
largest portion of Germa in the Hellespont was reduced to ruins by
another earthquake. Nevertheless no impression was made on the mind of
either Eudoxius the Arian bishop, or the emperor Valens, by these
occurrences; for they did not desist from their relentless persecution
of those who dissented from them in matters of faith. Meanwhile these
convulsions of the earth were regarded as typical of the disturbances
which agitated the churches: for many of the clerical body were sent
into exile, as we have stated; Basil and Gregory alone, by a special
dispensation of Divine Providence, being on account of their eminent
piety exempted from this punishment. The former of these individuals was
bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia; while Gregory presided over
Nazianzus, <span id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592) a little city in the
vicinity of Cæsarea. But we shall have occasion to mention both Basil
and Gregory again in the course of our history. <span

<span id="ii.vii.xi-p6"></span>If Socrates means to speak with precision
here of the offices occupied by these men during the year which his
narrative has reached he is mistaken, for Basil became bishop of Cæsarea
in Cappadocia the year following, and Gregory was made bishop, not of
Nazianzus at this time, but of Sisima. He did not, however, enter on the
duties of this bishopric as he says in his letters.
