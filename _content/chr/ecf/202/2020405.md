<span id="iii.x.xii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.xii-p2.1"></span>After</span> the return of Athanasius,
Lucifer, bishop of Cagliari in Sardinia, and Eusebius, bishop of
Vercelli, a city of Liguria in Italy, returned from the upper
Thebaïs. <span id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390) They had been
condemned by Constantius to perpetual exile in that country. For the
regulation and general systematizing of ecclesiastical affairs, Eusebius
came to Alexandria, and there, in concert with Athanasius, to hold a
council for the purpose of confirming the Nicene doctrines.

<span id="iii.x.xii-p4"></span>Lucifer sent a deacon with Eusebius to
take his place in the council, and went himself to Antioch, to visit the
church there in its disturbances.

<span id="iii.x.xii-p5"></span>A schism had been excited by the Arians
then under the guidance of Euzoïus, and by the followers of Meletius,
who, as I have above stated, were at variance even with those who held
the same opinions as themselves. As Meletius had not then returned from
exile, Lucifer ordained Paulinus bishop. <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391)

<span id="iii.x.xii-p7"></span>In the meantime, the bishops of many
cities had assembled in Alexandria with Athanasius and Eusebius, and had
confirmed the Nicene doctrines. They confessed that the Holy Ghost is of
the same substance as the Father and the Son, and they made use of the
term “Trinity.”

<span id="iii.x.xii-p8"></span>They declared that the human nature
assumed by God the Word is to be regarded as consisting of not a perfect
body only, but also of a perfect soul, even as was taught by the ancient
Church philosophers. As the Church had been agitated by questions
concerning the terms “substance” and “hypostasis,” and the contentions
and disputes about these words had been frequent, they decreed, and, as
I think, wisely, that these terms should not henceforth at the beginning
be used in reference to God, except in refutation of the Sabellian
tenet; lest from the paucity of terms, one and the same thing might
appear to be called by three names; but that one might understand each
by its peculiar term in a threefold way.

<span id="iii.x.xii-p9"></span>These were the decrees passed by the
bishops convened at Alexandria. Athanasius read in the council the
document about his flight which he had written in order to justify
himself. <span id="fr_1392"></span>[1393](#fn_1392)
