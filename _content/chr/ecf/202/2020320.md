<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVIII</span>.—*The Arians and
Melitians confer Celebrity on Athanasius; concerning Eusebius, and his
Request of Athanasius to admit Arius to Communion; concerning the Term
“Consubstantial”; Eusebius Pamphilus and Eustathius, Bishop of Antioch,
create Tumults above all the rest*.

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vii.xviii-p2.1"></span>The</span> reputation of Athanasius was,
however, especially increased by the Arians and Melitians; <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[1171](#fn_1170) although always plotting, they
never appeared rightly to catch and make him a prisoner. In the first
place, Eusebius wrote to urge him to receive the Arians into communion,
and threatened, without writing it, to ill-treat him should he refuse to
do so. But as Athanasius would not yield to his representation, but
maintained that those who had devised a heresy in innovating upon the
truth, and who had been condemned by the council of Nice, ought not to
be received into the Church, Eusebius contrived to interest the emperor
in favor of Arius, and so procured his return. I shall state a little
further on how all these events came to pass. <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[1172](#fn_1171)

<span id="iii.vii.xviii-p5"></span>At this period, the bishops had
another tumultuous dispute among themselves, concerning the precise
meaning of the term “consubstantial.” <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1173](#fn_1172) Some thought that this term could
not be admitted without blasphemy; that it implied the non-existence of
the Son of God; and that it involved the error of Montanus and
Sabellius. Those, on the other hand, who defended the term, regarded
their opponents as Greeks (or pagans), and considered that their
sentiments led to polytheism. Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus, and
Eustathius, bishop of Antioch, took the lead in this dispute. They both
confessed the Son of God to exist hypostatically, and yet they contended
together as if they had misunderstood each other. Eustathius accused
Eusebius of altering the doctrines ratified by the council of Nicæa,
while the latter declared that he approved of all the Nicæan doctrines,
and reproached Eustathius for cleaving to the heresy of Sabellius.
