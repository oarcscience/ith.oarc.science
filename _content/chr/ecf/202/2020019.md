<span id="ii.iv.x-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*The Emperor also summons to
the Synod Acesius, Bishop of the Novatians.*

<span id="ii.iv.x-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.x-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor’s diligence induces me to
mention another circumstance expressive of his mind, and serving to show
how much he desired peace. For aiming at ecclesiastical harmony, he
summoned to the council Acesius also, a bishop of the sect of Novatians.
Now, when the declaration of faith had been written out and subscribed
by the Synod, the emperor asked Acesius whether he would also agree to
this creed to the settlement of the day on which Easter should be
observed. He replied, ‘The Synod has determined nothing new, my prince:
for thus heretofore, even from the beginning, from the times of the
apostles, I traditionally received the definition of the faith, and the
time of the celebration of Easter.’ When, therefore, the emperor further
asked him, ‘For what reason then do you separate yourself from communion
with the rest of the Church?’ he related what had taken place during the
persecution under Decius; and referred to the rigidness of that austere
canon which declares, that it is not right persons who after baptism
have committed a sin, which the sacred Scriptures denominate ‘a sin unto
death’ <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190) to be considered worthy
of participation in the sacraments: <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191) that they should indeed be exhorted to
repentance, but were not to expect remission from the priest, but from
God, who is able and has authority to forgive sins. <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192) When Acesius had thus spoken, the
emperor said to him, ‘Place a ladder, Acesius, and climb alone into
heaven.’ <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193) Neither Eusebius
Pamphilus nor any other has ever mentioned these things: but I heard
them from a man by no means prone to falsehood, who was very old, and
simply stated what had taken place in the council in the course of a
narrative. From which I conjecture that those who have passed by this
occur<span id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span
id="ii.iv.x-Page_18"></span>rence in silence, were actuated by motives
which have influenced many other historians: for they frequently
suppress important facts, either from prejudice against some, or
partiality towards others.
