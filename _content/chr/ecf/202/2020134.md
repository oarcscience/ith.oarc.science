<span id="ii.vii.ix-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*Valens persecutes the
Novatians, because they accepted the Orthodox Faith.*

<span id="ii.vii.ix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vii.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> emperor however did not cease his
persecution of those who embraced the doctrine of the *homoousion,* but
drove them away from Constantinople: and as the Novatians acknowledged
the same faith, they also were subjected to similar treatment. He
commanded that their churches should be shut up, also their bishop they
sent into exile. His name was Agelius, a person that had presided over
their churches from the time of Constantine, and had led an apostolic
life: for he always walked barefoot, and used but one coat, observing
the injunction of the gospel. <span id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585)
But the emperor’s displeasure against this sect was moderated by the
efforts of a pious and eloquent man named Marcian, who had formerly been
in military service at the imperial palace, but was at that time a
presbyter in the Novatian church, and taught Anastasia and Carosa, the
emperor’s daughters, grammar; from the former of whom the public baths
yet standing, which Valens erected at Constantinople, were named. <span
id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586) From respect for this person therefore
the Novatian churches which had been <span id="page_100">p. 100</span>
<span id="ii.vii.ix-Page_100"></span>for some time closed, were again
opened. The Arians however would not suffer this people to remain
undisturbed, for they disliked them on account of the sympathy and love
the Novatians manifested toward the Homoousians, with whom they agreed
in sentiment. Such was the state of affairs at that time. We may here
remark that the war against the usurper Procopius was terminated about
the end of May, in the consulate <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587)
of Gratian and Dagalaïfus.

<span id="ii.vii.ix-p4"></span>Am. Marcellinus (*Rerum Gestarum,* XXVI.
4. 14), in speaking of Procopius, the usurper, says: ‘Procopius…resorted
to the Anastasian baths, named from the sister of Constantine’; from
which it appears that either (1) there were two baths of the same name,
or (2) the baths here alluded to were named after Constantine’s sister
and renamed on the occasion of their being repaired or altered, or (3)
that Socrates is in error. From the improbabilities connected with (1)
and (2) we may infer that (3) is the right view.
