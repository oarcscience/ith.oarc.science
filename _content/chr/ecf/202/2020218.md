<span id="ii.x.i-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*Anthemius the Prætorian
Prefect administers the Government of the East in Behalf of Young
Theodosius.*

<span id="ii.x.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.i-p3.1"></span>After</span> the death of Arcadius on the first
of May, during the consulate of Bassus and Philip, <span
id="fr_902"></span>[903](#fn_902) his brother Honorius still governed
the Western parts of the empire; but the administration of the East
devolved on his son Theodosius the Younger, then only eight years old.
The management of public affairs was therefore intrusted to Anthemius
the Prætorian prefect, grandson of that Philip who in the reign of
Constantius ejected Paul from the see of Constantinople, and established
Macedonius in his place. By his directions Constantinople was surrounded
with high walls. <span id="fr_903"></span>[904](#fn_903) He was esteemed
and actually was the most prudent man of his time, and seldom did
anything unadvisedly, but consulted with the most judicious of his
friends respecting all practical matters, and especially with
Troïlus <span id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904) the sophist, who while
excelling in philosophical attainments, was equal to Anthemius himself
in political wisdom. Wherefore almost all things were done with the
concurrence of Troïlus.

<span id="ii.x.i-p5"></span>This was done, according to Cedrenus,
several years later by another prefect. For this reason and because of
the grammatical construction in the original, Valesius rightly
conjectures that the phrase is a gloss introduced from the margin, and
should be expunged from the text.
