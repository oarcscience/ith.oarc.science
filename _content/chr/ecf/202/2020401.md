<span id="iii.x.viii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.viii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VIII</span>.—*Concerning Theodore,
the Keeper of the Sacred Vessels of Antioch. How Julian, the Uncle of
the Traitor, on Account of these Vessels, falls a Prey to Worms*.

<span id="iii.x.viii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.x.viii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is said that when Julian, the
uncle of the emperor, <span id="fr_1378"></span>[1379](#fn_1378) was
intent upon removing the votive gifts of the church of Antioch, which
were many and costly, and placing them in the imperial treasury, and
also closing the places of prayer, all the clergy fled. One presbyter,
by name Theodoritus, alone did not leave the city; Julian seized him, as
the keeper of the treasures, and as capable of giving information
concerning them, and maltreated him terribly; finally he ordered him to
be slain with the sword, after he had responded bravely under every
torture and had been well approved by his doctrinal confessions. When
Julian had made a booty of the sacred vessels, he flung them upon the
ground and began to mock; after blaspheming Christ as much as he wished,
he sat upon the vessels and augmented his insulting acts. Immediately
his genitals and rectum were corrupted; their flesh became putrescent,
and was changed into worms. The disease was beyond the skill of the
physicians. However, from reverence and fear for the emperor, they
resorted to experiments with all manner of drugs, and the most costly
and the fattest birds were slain, and their fat was applied to the
corrupted parts, in the hope that the worms might be thereby attracted
to the surface, but this was of no effect; <span id="page_332">p.
332</span> <span id="iii.x.viii-Page_332"></span>for being deep buried,
they crept into the living flesh, and did not cease their gnawing until
they put an end to his life. It seemed that this calamity was an
infliction of Divine wrath, because the keeper of the imperial
treasures, and other of the chief officers of the court who had made
sport of the Church, died in an extraordinary and dreadful manner, <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[1380](#fn_1379) as if condemned by Divine wrath.
