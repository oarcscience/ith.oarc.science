<p class="c24"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p2.1"></A>During</span> the consulate of Constantine C&aelig;sar and Crispus C&aelig;sar, Silvester governed the Church of Rome; Alexander, that of Alexandria; and Macarius, that of Jerusalem. Not one, since Romanus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1067"></A><A HREF="#fn_1067"><FONT SIZE="1">1068</FONT></A>
  had been appointed over the Church of Antioch on the Orontes; for the persecution it appears, had prevented the ceremony of ordination from taking place. The bishops assembled at Nic&aelig;a not long after were, however, so sensible of the purity of the life and doctrines of Eustathius, that they adjudged him worthy to fill the apostolic see; although he was then bishop of the neighboring Ber&#339;a, they translated him to Antioch.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1068"></A><A HREF="#fn_1068"><FONT SIZE="1">1069</FONT></A>
  </p>   
<p class="c25"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p5"></A>The Christians of the East, as far as Libya on the borders of Egypt, did not dare to meet openly as a church; for Licinius had withdrawn his favor from them; but the Christians of the West, the Greeks, the Macedonians, and the Illyrians, met for worship in safety through the protection of Constantine, who was then at the head of the Roman Empire.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1069"></A><A HREF="#fn_1069"><FONT SIZE="1">1070</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vi.ii-p3"></A>Who this Romanus was is uncertain, as his name does not occur in the catalogue of bishops of Antioch, according to Hieronymus&#146; edition of the <i>Chronicon,</i> nor in Nicephorus. In one index at the end of a codex of Eusebius&#146; <i>History,</i> in Florence, his name occurs as the twenty-second, in order, and between Philagonius and Eustathius. Theodoret, <i>H. E.</i> i. 3, gives the succession Vitalis, Philagonius.</p>
