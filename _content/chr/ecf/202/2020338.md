id="iii.viii.i-p2.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*After the Death of
Constantine the Great, the Adherents of Eusebius and Theognis attack the
Nicene Faith*.

<span id="iii.viii.i-p3"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.i-p3.1"></span>We</span> have now seen what events
transpired in the churches during the reign of Constantine. <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[1208](#fn_1207) On his death the doctrine which had
been set forth at Nicæa, was subjected to renewed examination. Although
this doctrine was not universally approved, no one, during the life of
Constantine, had dared to reject it openly. At his death, however, many
renounced this opinion, especially those who had previously been
suspected of treachery. Of all these Eusebius and Theognis, bishops of
the province of Bithynia, did everything in their power to give
predominance to the tenets of Arius. They believed that this object
would be easily accomplished, if the return of Athanasius from exile
could be prevented, and by giving the government of the Egyptian
churches to a bishop of like opinion with them. They found an efficient
coadjutor in the presbyter who had obtained from Constantine the recall
of Arius. He was held in high esteem by the emperor Constantius, on
account of the service he had rendered in delivering to him the
testament of his father; since he was trusted, he boldly seized the
opportunities, until he became an intimate of the emperor’s wife, and of
the powerful eunuchs of the women’s sleeping apartments. At this period
Eusebius <span id="fr_1208"></span>[1209](#fn_1208) was appointed to
superintend the concerns of the royal household, and being zealously
attached to Arianism, he induced the empress and many of the persons
belonging to the court to adopt the same sentiments. Hence disputations
concerning doctrines again became prevalent, both in private and in
public, and revilings and animosities were renewed. This state of things
was in accordance with the views of Theognis and his partisans.
