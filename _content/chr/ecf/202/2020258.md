<span id="ii.x.xli-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI</span>.—*Excellent Qualities of
Proclus.*

<span id="ii.x.xli-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xli-p2.1"></span>Proclus</span> was a reader at a very early
age, and assiduously frequenting the schools, became devoted to the
study of rhetoric. On attaining <span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span
id="ii.x.xli-Page_176"></span>manhood he was in the habit of constant
intercourse with Atticus the bishop, having been constituted his
secretary. When he had made great progress, his patron promoted him to
the rank of deacon; subsequently being elevated to the presbyterate, as
we have before stated, he was ordained by Sisinnius to be bishop of
Cyzicus. <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1029](#fn_1028) But all these things
were done long before. At this time he was allotted the episcopal chair
of Constantinople. He was a man of moral excellence equal to any other;
for having been trained by Atticus, he was a zealous imitator of all
that bishop’s virtues. Patience, however, he exercised to a greater
degree than his master, who occasionally practiced severities upon the
heretics; for Proclus was gentle towards everybody, being convinced that
kindness is far more effective than violence in advancing the cause of
truth. Resolving therefore to vexatiously interfere with no heresy
whatever, he restored in his own person to the church that mild and
benign dignity of character, which had so often before been unhappily
violated. In this respect he followed the example of the Emperor
Theodosius; for as the latter had determined never to exercise his
imperial authority against criminals, so had Proclus likewise purposed
not to disquiet those who entertained other sentiments on divine
subjects than those which he cherished himself.
