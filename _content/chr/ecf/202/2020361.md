<span id="iii.viii.xxiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Letter of
Conciliation from Valens and Ursacius to the Great Athanasius.
Restoration of the Other Eastern Bishops to their own Sees. Ejection of
Macedonius again; and Accession of Paul to the See*.

<span id="iii.viii.xxiv-p2"></span>“<span class="c13"><span
id="iii.viii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>The</span> bishops, Ursacius and Valens,
to Athanasius, our brother in the Lord. <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[1280](#fn_1279)

<span id="iii.viii.xxiv-p4"></span>“We take the opportunity of the
departure of Museus, our brother and fellow-presbyter, who is going to
your esteemed self, O beloved brother, to send you amplest greeting from
Aquileia through him, and hope that our letter will find you in good
health. You will afford us great encouragement if you will write us a
reply to this letter. Know that we are at peace and in ecclesiastical
communion with you.”

<span id="iii.viii.xxiv-p5"></span>Athanasius therefore returned under
such circumstances from the West to Egypt. Paul, Marcellus, Asclepas,
and Lucius, whom the edict of the emperor had returned from exile,
received their own sees. Immediately on the return of Paul to
Constantinople Macedonius retired, and held church in private. There was
a great tumult at Ancyra on the deposition of Basil from the church
there, and the reinstallation of Marcellus. The other bishops were
reinstated in their churches without difficulty. <span
