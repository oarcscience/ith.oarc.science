<p class="c24"><a name="iii.vii.viii-p2"></A><span class="c11"><a name="iii.vii.viii-p2.1"></A>Subsequently</span> the Christian religion became known to the neighboring tribes and was very greatly disseminated.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">1155</FONT></A>
  The Armenians, I have understood, were the first to embrace Christianity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1155"></A><A HREF="#fn_1155"><FONT SIZE="1">1156</FONT></A>
  It is said that Tiridates, then the sovereign of that nation, became a Christian by means of a marvelous Divine sign which was wrought in his own house; and that he issued commands to all the subjects, by a herald, to adopt the same religion.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1156"></A><A HREF="#fn_1156"><FONT SIZE="1">1157</FONT></A>
  I think that the beginning of the conversion of the Persians&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1157"></A><A HREF="#fn_1157"><FONT SIZE="1">1158</FONT></A>
  was owing to their intercourse with the Osroenians and Armenians; for it is likely that they would converse with such Divine men and make experience of their virtue. </p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iii.vii.viii-p4"></A>The source of this chapter certainly is not Moses Chorenensis.

Yet parts of Armenia were Christianized much earlier. Dionysius bishop of Alexandria wrote a letter on Repentance to the Armenians in the reign of Gallus. Eus. <i>H. E.</i> vi. 46. Cf. Agathangelas, History of Tiridates the Great, and the preaching of Gregory the Illuminator.</p>
