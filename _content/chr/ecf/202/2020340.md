<span id="iii.viii.iii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*Paul, Bishop of
Constantinople, and Macedonius, the Pneumatomachian*.

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.viii.iii-p2.1"></span>Alexander</span> died <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[1215](#fn_1214) about this time, and Paul succeeded
to the high priesthood of Constantinople. The followers of Arius and
Macedonius assert that he took possession at his own motion, and against
the advice of Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, or of Theodore, bishop of
Heraclea, in Thrace; upon whom, as being the nearest bishops, the right
of conferring ordination devolved. Many, however, maintain, on the
testimony of Alexander, whom he succeeded, that he was ordained by the
bishops who were then assembled at Constantinople. <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[1216](#fn_1215) For when Alexander, who was
ninety-eight years of age, and who had conducted the episcopal office
vigorously for twenty-three years, was at the point of death, his
clergy, asked him to whom he wished to turn over his church. “If,”
replied he, “you seek a man good in Divine matters and one who is apt to
teach you, have Paul. But if you desire one who is conversant with
public affairs, and with the councils of rulers, Macedonius is better.”
The Macedonians themselves admit that this testimony was given by
Alexander; but they say that Paul was more skilled in the transaction of
business and the art of eloquence; but they put emphasis for Macedonius,
on the testimony of his life; and they accuse Paul of having been
addicted to effeminacy and an indifferent conduct. <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[1217](#fn_1216) It appears, however, from their own
acknowledgment, that Paul was a man of eloquence, and brilliant in
teaching the Church. Events proved that he was not competent to combat
the casualties of life, or to hold intercourse with those in power; for
he was never successful in subverting the machinations of his
enemies, <span id="fr_1217"></span>[1218](#fn_1217) like those who are
adroit in the management of affairs. Although he was greatly beloved by
the people, he suffered severely from the treachery of those who then
rejected the doctrine which prevailed at Nicæa. In the first place, he
was expelled from the church of Constantinople, as if some accusation of
misconduct had been established against him. <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[1219](#fn_1218) He was then condemned to
banishment, and finally, it is said, fell a victim to the devices of his
enemies, and was strangled. But these latter events took place at a
subsequent period.
