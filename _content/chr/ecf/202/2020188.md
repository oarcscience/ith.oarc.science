<span id="ii.viii.xxiv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIII</span>.—*Further Dissensions
among the Arians at Constantinople. The Psathyrians.*

<span id="ii.viii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.viii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>But</span> dissensions arose among the
Arians <span id="fr_801"></span>[802](#fn_801) also on this account. The
contentious questions which were daily agitated among them, led them to
start the most absurd propositions. For whereas it has been always
believed in the church that God is the Father of the Son, the Word, it
was asked whether God could be called ‘Father’ before the Son had
subsistence? Thus in asserting that the Word of God was not begotten of
the Father, but was created out ‘of nothing,’ and thus falling into
error on the chief and main point, they deservedly fell into absurd
cavilings about a mere name. Dorotheus therefore being sent for by them
from Antioch maintained that God neither was nor could be called Father
before the Son existed. But Marinus whom they had summoned out of Thrace
before Dorotheus, piqued at the superior deference which was paid to his
rival, undertook to defend the contrary opinion. In consequence of these
things there arose a schism among them, and being thus divided
respecting this term, each party held separate meetings. Those under
Dorotheus retained their original places of assembly: but the followers
of Marinus built distinct oratories for themselves, and asserted that
the Father had always been Father, even when the Son was not. This
section of the Arians was denominated *Psathyrians*, <span
id="fr_802"></span>[803](#fn_802) because one of the most zealous
defenders of this opinion was Theoctistus, a Syrian by birth, and a
cake-seller \[*Psathyrop<span id="ii.viii.xxiv-p4.1"></span>ola*\] <span
id="fr_803"></span>[804](#fn_803) by trade. Selenas <span
id="fr_804"></span>[805](#fn_804) bishop of the Goths adopted the views
of this party, a man of mixed descent; he was a Goth by his father’s
side, but by his mother’s a Phrygian, by which means he taught in the
church with great readiness in both these languages. This faction
however soon quarreled among themselves, Marinus disagreeing with
Agapius, whom he himself had preferred to the bishopric of Ephesus. They
disputed, however, not about any point of religion, but in
narrow-mindedness about precedence, in which the Goths sided with
Agapius. Wherefore many of the ecclesiastics under their jurisdiction,
abominating the vain-glorious contest between these two, abandoned them
both, and became adherents to the ‘homoousian’ faith. The Arians having
continued thus divided among themselves during the space of thirty-five
years, were reunited in the reign of Theodosius the Younger, under the
consulate <span id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805) of Plintha the
commander-in-chief of the army, he being a member of the sect of
Psathyrians; these were prevailed on to desist from contention. They
afterwards passed a resolution, giving it all the cogency of law, that
the question which had led to their separation, should never be mooted
again. But this reconciliation extended no farther than Constantinople;
for in other cities where any of these two parties were found, they
persisted in their former separation. So much respecting the division
among the Arians.
