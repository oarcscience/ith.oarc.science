<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXII</span>.—*Overthrow of the
Usurper Magnentius.*

<span id="ii.v.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xxxii-p2.1"></span>Magnentius</span> in the meanwhile having
made himself master of the imperial city Rome, put to death many members
of the senatorial council, as well as many of the populace. But as soon
as the commanders under Constantius had collected an army of Romans, and
commenced their march against him, he left Rome, and retired into the
Gauls. There several battles were fought, sometimes to the advantage of
one party, and sometimes to that of the other: but at last Magnentius
having been defeated near Mursa—a fortress of Gaul—was there closely
besieged. In this place the following remarkable incident is said to
have occurred. Magnentius desiring to reassure the courage of his
soldiers who were disheartened by their late overthrow, ascended a lofty
tribunal for this purpose. They, wishing to give utterance to the usual
acclamation with which they greet emperors, contrary to their intention
simultaneously all shouted the name not of Magnentius, but of
Constantius Augustus. Regarding this as an omen unfavorable to himself,
Magnentius immediately withdrew from the fortress, and retreated to the
remotest parts of Gaul. Thither the generals of Constantius hastened in
pursuit. An engagement having again taken place near Mount
Seleucus, <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379) Magnentius was totally
routed, and fled alone to Lyons, a city of Gaul, which is distant three
days’ journey from the fortress at Mursa. Magnentius, having reached
this city, first slew his own mother; then having killed his brother
also, whom he had created Cæsar, he at last committed suicide by falling
on his own sword. This happened in the sixth consulate of Constantius,
and the second of Constantius Gallus, on the fifteenth <span
id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380) day of August. Not long after, the
other brother of Magnentius, named Decentius, put an end to his own life
by hanging himself. Such was the end of the enterprises of Magnentius.
The affairs of the empire were not altogether quieted; for soon after
this another usurper arose whose name was Silvanus: but the generals of
Constantius speedily put him also out of the way, whilst raising
disturbances in Gaul.
