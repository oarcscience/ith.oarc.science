<span id="ii.iv.xxxvi-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXVI</span>.—*Of Marcellus Bishop
of Ancyra, and Asterius the Sophist.*

<span id="ii.iv.xxxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.iv.xxxvi-p2.1"></span>The</span> bishops assembled at
Constantinople deposed also Marcellus bishop of Ancyra, a city of
Galatia Minor, on this account. A certain rhetorician of Cappadocia
named Asterius having abandoned his art, and professed himself a convert
to Christianity, undertook the composition of some treatises, which are
still extant, in which he commended the dogmas of Arius; asserting that
Christ is the power of God, in the same sense as the locust and the
palmer-worm are said by Moses to be the power of God, <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252) with other similar utterances. Now
Asterius was in constant association with the bishops, and especially
with those of their number who did not discountenance the Arian
doctrine: he also attended their Synods, in the hope of insinuating
himself into the bishopric of some city: but he failed to obtain
ordination, in consequence of having sacrificed during the
persecution. <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253) Going therefore
throughout the cities of Syria, he read in public the books which he had
composed. Marcellus being informed of this, and wishing to counteract
his influence, in his over-anxiety to confute him, fell into the
diametrically opposite error; for he dared to say, as the
Samosatene <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254) had done, that Christ
was a mere man. When the bishops then convened at Jerusalem had
intelligence of these things, they took no notice of Asterius, because
he was not enrolled even in the catalogue of ordained priests; but they
insisted that Marcellus, as a priest, should give an account of the book
which he had written. Finding that he entertained Paul of Samosata’s
sentiments, they required him to retract his <span id="page_34">p.
34</span> <span id="ii.iv.xxxvi-Page_34"></span>opinion; and he being
thoroughly ashamed of himself, promised to burn his book. But the
convention of bishops being hastily dissolved by the emperor’s summoning
them to Constantinople, the Eusebians on their arrival at that city,
again took the case of Marcellus into consideration; and as Marcellus
refused to fulfil his promise of burning his untimely book, those
present deposed him, and sent Basil into Ancyra in his stead. Moreover
Eusebius wrote a refutation of this work in three books, in which he
exposed its erroneous doctrine. Marcellus however was afterwards
reinstated <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255) in his bishopric by
the Synod at Sardica, on his assurance that his book had been
misunderstood, and that on that account he was supposed to favor the
Samosatene’s views. But of this we shall speak more fully in its proper
place.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxvi-p4"></span>In the persecution under Decius (249
<span class="c13"><span id="ii.iv.xxxvi-p4.1"></span>a.d.</span>), those
who yielded so far as to perform the heathen rites were branded with the
title of ‘the lapsed’; and a controversy arose later on the manner in
which they should be treated. One of the consequences of lapsing was
disqualification for high office in the church. See Neander, *Hist. of
Christ. Ch.* Vol. I. p. 226 seq.

<span id="ii.iv.xxxvi-p5"></span>Paul of Samosata, who has been surnamed
in modern times the Socinus of the third century, was deposed in 269
<span class="c13"><span id="ii.iv.xxxvi-p5.1"></span>a.d.</span> by a
council held at Antioch for unchristian character and unsound views. His
peculiarity in the latter respect was his denial of the divinity of
Jesus Christ. For fuller information, see Eus. *H. E.* VII. 30; Epiphan.
