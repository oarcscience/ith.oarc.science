<span id="iii.vi.x-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Concerning the Great
Confessors who survived*.

<span id="iii.vi.x-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.x-p2.1"></span>Since</span> the persecution had recently
ceased, many excellent Christians, and many of the confessors who had
survived, adorned the churches: among these were Hosius, <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1089](#fn_1088) bishop of Cordova; Amphion, <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[1090](#fn_1089) bishop of Epiphania in Cilicia;
Maximus, who succeeded Macarius in the church of Jerusalem; and
Paphnutius, <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1091](#fn_1090) an Egyptian. It
is said by this latter God wrought many miracles, controlling demons,
and giving him grace to heal divers kinds of sickness. This Paphnutius,
and Maximus, whom we just mentioned, were among the number of confessors
whom Maximinus condemned to work in the mines, after having deprived
them of the right eye, and the use of the left leg.
