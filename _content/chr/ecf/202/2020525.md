id="iii.xiv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*The Disturbance which
the Greeks and Christians had about Attalus. The Courageous Saros;
Alaric, by a Stratagem, obtains Possession of Rome, and protected the
Sacred Asylum of the Apostle Peter*.

<span id="iii.xiv.ix-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.ix-p2.1"></span>The</span> failure which had attended the
designs of Attalus was a source of deep displeasure the pagans and
Christians of the Arian heresy. <span
id="fr_1631"></span>[1632](#fn_1631) The pagans had inferred from the
known predilections and early education of Attalus, that he would openly
maintain their superstitions, and restore their ancient temples, their
festivals, and their altars. The Arians imagined that, as soon as he
found his reign firmly established, Attalus would reinstate them in the
supremacy over the churches which they had enjoyed during the reigns of
Constantius and of Valens; for he had been baptized by Sigesarius, <span
id="fr_1632"></span>[1633](#fn_1632) bishop of the Goths, to the great
satisfaction of Alaric and the Arian party.

<span id="iii.xiv.ix-p5"></span>Soon after, Alaric stationed himself
among the Alps, at a distance of about sixty stadia from Ravenna, and
held a conference with the emperor concerning the conclusion of a peace.
Saros, a barbarian by birth, and highly practiced in the art of war, had
only about three hundred men with him, but all well disposed and most
efficient. He was suspicious of Alaric on account of their former
enmity, and reasoned that a treaty between the Romans and Goths would be
of no advantage to him. Suddenly advancing with his own troops, he slew
some of the barbarians. Impelled by rage and terror at this incident,
Alaric retraced his steps, and returned to Rome, and took it by
treachery. He permitted each of his followers to seize as much of the
wealth of the Romans as he was able, and to plunder all the houses; but
from respect towards the Apostle Peter, he commanded that the large and
very spacious church erected around his tomb should be an asylum. This
was the only cause which prevented the entire demolition of Rome; and
those who were there saved, and they were many, rebuilt the city.
