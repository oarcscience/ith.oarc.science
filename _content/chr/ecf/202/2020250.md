id="ii.x.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXXIII</span>.—*Desecration of the
Altar of the Great Church by Runaway Slaves.*

<span id="ii.x.xxxiii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.x.xxxiii-p2.1"></span>While</span> matters were in this state it
happened that an outrage was perpetrated in the church. For the
domestics of a man of quality who were foreigners, having experienced
harsh treatment from their master, fled from him to the church; and thus
they ran up to the very altar with their swords drawn. <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[1012](#fn_1011) Nor could they be prevailed upon by
any entreaties to withdraw; so that they impeded the performance of the
sacred services; but inasmuch as they obstinately maintained their
position for several days, brandishing their weapons in defiance of any
one who dared to approach them—and in fact killed one of the
ecclesiastics, and wounded another—they were finally compelled to slay
themselves. A person who was present at this desecration of the
sanctuary, remarked that such a profanation was an ominous presage, and
in support of his view of the matter, quoted the two following iambics
of an ancient poet:—

<span id="ii.x.xxxiii-p4"></span><span id="page_172">p. 172</span> <span
id="ii.x.xxxiii-Page_172"></span>“For such prognostics happen at a time

<span id="ii.x.xxxiii-p5"></span>When temples are defiled by impious
crime.”

<span id="ii.x.xxxiii-p6"></span>Nor was he who made the prediction
disappointed in these inauspicious forebodings: for they signified as it
seems a division among the people, and the deposition of the author of
it.
