<span id="ii.ix.xx-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XIX</span>.—*Ordination of Arsacius as
John’s Successor. Indisposition of Cyrinus Bishop of Chalcedon.*

<span id="ii.ix.xx-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.ix.xx-p2.1"></span>After</span> the lapse of a few days, Arsacius
was ordained bishop of Constantinople; he was a brother of Nectarius who
so ably administered the see before John, although he was then very
aged, being upwards of eighty years old. While he very mildly and
peacefully administered the episcopate, Cyrinus bishop of Chalcedon,
upon whose foot Maruthas bishop of Mesopotamia had inadvertently
trodden, became so seriously affected by the accident, that
mortification ensued, and it became necessary to amputate his foot. Nor
was this amputation performed once only, but was required to be often
repeated: for after the injured limb was cut off, the evil so permeated
his whole system, that the other foot also having become affected by the
disease had to submit to the same operation. <span
id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885) I have alluded to this circumstance,
because many have affirmed that what he suffered was a judgment upon him
for his calumnious aspersions of John, whom he so often designated as
arrogant and inexorable, <span id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886) as I
have already said. <span id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887) Furthermore
as on the 30th of September, in the last-mentioned consulate, <span
id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888) there was an extraordinary fall of
hail of immense size at Constantinople and its suburbs, it also was
declared to be an expression of Divine indignation on account of
Chrysostom’s unjust deposition: and the death of the empress tended to
give increased credibility to these reports, for it took place four days
after the hail-storm. Others, however, asserted that John had been
deservedly deposed, because of the violence he had exercised in Asia and
Lydia, in depriving the Novatians and Quartodecimans of many of their
churches, when he went to Ephesus and ordained Heraclides. But whether
John’s deposition was just, as his enemies declare, or Cyrinus suffered
in chastisement for his slanderous revilings; whether the hail fell, or
the empress died on John’s account, or whether these things happened for
other reasons, or for these in connection with others, God only knows,
who is the discerner of secrets, and the just judge of truth itself. I
have simply recorded the reports which were current at that time.
