<span id="iii.ix.vii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Death of the Tyrants
Magnentius and Silvanus the Apostate. Sedition of the Jews in Palestine.
Gallus Cæsar is slain, on Suspicion of Revolution*.

<span id="iii.ix.vii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.ix.vii-p2.1"></span>In</span> the meantime, <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[1295](#fn_1294) Magnentius made himself <span
id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span id="iii.ix.vii-Page_304"></span>master
of ancient Rome, and put numbers of the senators, and of the people, to
death. Hearing that the troops of Constantius were approaching, he
retired into Gaul; and here the two parties had frequent encounters, in
which sometimes the one and sometimes the other was victorious. At
length, however, Magnentius was defeated, and fled to Mursa, which is
the fortress of this Gaul, and when he saw that his soldiers were
dispirited because they had been defeated, he stood on an elevated spot
and endeavored to revive their courage. But, although they addressed
Magnentius with the acclamations usually paid to emperors, and were
ready to shout at his public appearance, they secretly and without
premeditation shouted for Constantius as emperor in place of Magnentius.
Magnentius, concluding from this circumstance, that he was not destined
by God to hold the reins of empire, endeavored to retreat from the
fortress to some distant place. But he was pursued by the troops of
Constantius, and being overtaken at a spot called Mount Seleucus, he
escaped alone from the encounter, and fled to Lugduna. On his arrival
there, he slew his own mother and his brother, whom he had named Cæsar;
and lastly, he killed himself. <span
id="fr_1295"></span>[1296](#fn_1295) Not long after, Decentius, another
of his brothers, put an end to his own existence. Still the public
tumults were not quelled; for not long after, Silvanus assumed the
supreme authority in Gaul; but he was put to death immediately by the
generals of Constantius.

<span id="iii.ix.vii-p5"></span>The Jews of Diocæsarea also overran
Palestine and the neighboring territories; they took up arms with the
design of shaking off the Roman yoke. <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[1297](#fn_1296) On hearing of their insurrection,
Gallus Cæsar, who was then at Antioch, sent troops against them,
defeated them, and destroyed Diocæsarea. Gallus, intoxicated with
success, could not bear his prosperity, but aspired to the supreme
power, and he slew Magnus, the quæstor, and Domitian, the prefect of the
East, because they apprised the emperor of his innovations. The anger of
Constantius was excited; and he summoned him to his presence. Gallus did
not dare to refuse obedience, and set out on his journey. When, however,
he reached the island Elavona he was killed by the emperor’s order; this
event occurred in the third year of his consulate, and the seventh of
Constantius. <span id="fr_1297"></span>[1298](#fn_1297)
