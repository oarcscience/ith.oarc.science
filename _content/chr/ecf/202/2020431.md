<span id="iii.xi.xv-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV</span>.—*Disputes between
Eusebius, Bishop of Cæsarea, and Basil the Great. Hence the Arians took
courage and came to Cæsarea, and were repulsed*.

<span id="iii.xi.xv-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xi.xv-p2.1"></span>When</span> Valens quitted Nicomedia, he went
on to Antioch; <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454) and in passing
through Cappadocia he did all in his power, according to custom, to
injure the orthodox and to deliver up the churches to the Arians. He
thought to accomplish his designs the more easily on account of a
dispute <span id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455) which was then
pending between Basil and Eusebius, who then governed the church of
Cæsarea. This dissension had been the cause of Basil’s departing from
Pontus, where he lived conjointly with some monks who pursued the
philosophy. The people and some of the most powerful and the wisest men
in the city began to regard Eusebius with suspicion, particularly as
they considered him the cause of the withdrawal of one who was equally
celebrated for his piety and his eloquence; and they accordingly began
to plan a secession and the holding of separate church. In the meantime
Basil, fearing to be a source of further trouble to the Church, which
was already rent by the dissensions of heretics, remained in retirement
in the monasteries at Pontus. The emperor and the bishops of the Arian
heresy, who were always attached to his suite, were more inspirited in
their designs by the absence of Basil and the hatred of the people
towards Eusebius. But the event was contrary to their judgment. On the
first intelligence of the intention of the emperor to pass through
Cappadocia, Basil quitted Pontus and returned to Cæsarea, where he
effected a reconciliation with Eusebius, and by his eloquence he
opportunely aided the Church. The projects of Valens were thus defeated,
and he returned with his bishops without having accomplished any of his
designs.
