<span id="ii.v.xli-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xli-p1.1"></span>Chapter XLI</span>.—*On the Emperor’s Return
from the West, the Acacians assemble at Constantinople, and confirm the
Creed of Ariminum, after making Some Additions to it.*

<span id="ii.v.xli-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.v.xli-p2.1"></span>And</span> now the emperor returned from the
West and appointed a prefect over Constantinople, Honoratus by name,
having abolished the office of proconsul. <span
id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426) But the Acacians being beforehand with
the bishops, calumniated them to the emperor, persuading him not to
admit the creed which they had proposed. This so annoyed the emperor
that he resolved to disperse them; he therefore published an edict,
commanding that such of them as were subject to fill certain public
offices should be no longer exempted from the performance of the duties
attached to them. For several of them were liable to be called on to
occupy various official departments, <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427) connected both with the city
magistracy, and in subordination to the presidents and governors of
provinces. <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428) While these were thus
harassed the partisans of Acacius remained for a considerable time at
Constantinople and held another Synod. Sending for the bishops at
Bithynia, about fifty assembled on this occasion, among whom was Maris,
bishop of Chalcedon: these confirmed the creed read at Ariminum to which
the names of the consuls had been prefixed. <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429) It would have been unnecessary to
repeat it here, had there not been some additions made to it; but since
that was done, it may be desirable to transcribe it in its new
form. <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430)

<span id="ii.v.xli-p8"></span>‘We believe in one God the Father
Almighty, of whom are all things. And in the only-begotten Son of God,
begotten of God before all ages, and before every beginning; through
whom all things visible and invisible were made: who is the
only-begotten born of the Father, the only of the only, God of God, like
to the Father who begat him, according to the Scriptures, and whose
generation no one knows but the Father only that begat him. We know that
this only-begotten Son of God, as sent of the Father, came down from the
heavens, as it is written, for the destruction of sin and death: and
that he was born of the Holy Spirit, and of the Virgin Mary according to
the flesh, as it is written, and conversed with his disciples; and that
after every dispensation had been fulfilled according to his Father’s
will, he was crucified and died, and was buried and descended into the
lower parts of the earth, at whose presence hades itself trembled: who
also arose from the dead on the third day, again conversed with his
disciples, and after the completion of forty days was taken up into the
heavens, and sits at the right hand of the Father, whence he will come
in the last day, the day of the resurrection, in his Father’s glory, to
requite every one accord-to his works. \[We believe\] also in the Holy
Spirit, whom he himself the only-begotten of God, Christ our Lord and
God, promised to send to mankind as the Comforter, according as it is
written, <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431) “the Spirit of truth”;
whom he sent to them after he was received into the heavens. But since
the term *ousia* \[*substance or essence*\], which was used by the
fathers in a very simple and intelligible sense, but not being
understood by the people, has been a cause of offense, we have thought
proper to reject it, as it is not contained even in the sacred writings;
and that no mention of it should be made in future, inasmuch as the holy
Scriptures have nowhere mentioned the substance of the Father and of the
Son. Nor ought the “subsistence” of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Spirit to be even named. But we affirm that the Son is like the
Father, in such a manner as the sacred Scriptures declare and teach. Let
therefore all heresies which have been already condemned, or may have
arisen of late, which are opposed to this exposition of the faith, be
anathema.’

<span id="ii.v.xli-p10"></span>These things were recognized at that time
at Constantinople. And now as we have at length <span id="page_72">p.
72</span> <span id="ii.v.xli-Page_72"></span>wound our way through the
labyrinth of all the various forms of faith, let us reckon the number of
them. After that which was promulgated at Nicæa, two others were
proposed at Antioch at the dedication of the church there. <span
id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432) A third was presented to the Emperor
in Gaul by Narcissus and those who accompanied him. <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433) The fourth was sent by Eudoxius into
Italy. <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434) There were three forms of
the creed published at Sirmium, one of which having the consuls’ names
prefixed was read at Ariminum. <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435)
The Acacian party produced an eighth at Seleucia. <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436) The last was that of Constantinople,
containing the prohibitory clause respecting the mention of ‘substance’
or ‘subsistence’ in relation to God. To this creed Ulfilas bishop of the
Goths gave his assent, although he had previously adhered to that of
Nicæa; for he was a disciple of Theophilus bishop of the Goths, who was
present at the Nicene council, and subscribed what was there determined.
Let this suffice on these subjects.

proconsul and the different functions of each, see Smith, *Diction. of

first put Constantinople under a prefect is borne out by Athanasius’
mention of Donatus as proconsul of Europe, with Constantinople as chief
city.
