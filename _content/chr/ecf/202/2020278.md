<span id="iii.vi.ii-p1"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II</span>.—*Of the Bishops of the
Large Towns in the Reign of Constantine; and how, from fear of Licinius,
Christianity was professed cautiously in the East as far as Libya, while
in the West, through the Favor of Constantine, it was professed with
Freedom.*

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.vi.ii-p2.1"></span>During</span> the consulate of Constantine
Cæsar and Crispus Cæsar, Silvester governed the Church of Rome;
Alexander, that of Alexandria; and Macarius, that of Jerusalem. Not one,
since Romanus, <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1068](#fn_1067) had been
appointed over the Church of Antioch on the Orontes; for the persecution
it appears, had prevented the ceremony of ordination from taking place.
The bishops assembled at Nicæa not long after were, however, so sensible
of the purity of the life and doctrines of Eustathius, that they
adjudged him worthy to fill the apostolic see; although he was then
bishop of the neighboring Berœa, they translated him to Antioch. <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1069](#fn_1068)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p5"></span>The Christians of the East, as far as
Libya on the borders of Egypt, did not dare to meet openly as a church;
for Licinius had withdrawn his favor from them; but the Christians of
the West, the Greeks, the Macedonians, and the Illyrians, met for
worship in safety through the protection of Constantine, who was then at
the head of the Roman Empire. <span id="fr_1069"></span>[1070](#fn_1069)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p3"></span>Who this Romanus was is uncertain, as his
name does not occur in the catalogue of bishops of Antioch, according to
Hieronymus’ edition of the *Chronicon,* nor in Nicephorus. In one index
at the end of a codex of Eusebius’ *History,* in Florence, his name
occurs as the twenty-second, in order, and between Philagonius and
Eustathius. Theodoret, *H. E.* i. 3, gives the succession Vitalis,
Philagonius.
