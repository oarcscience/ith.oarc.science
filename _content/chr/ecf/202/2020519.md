id="iii.xiv.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*The Virtues of
Pulcheria; Her Sisters*.

<span id="iii.xiv.iii-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="iii.xiv.iii-p2.1"></span>It</span> is said that God frequently in
many other cases revealed to the princess what was about to happen, and
that the most occurred to her and her sisters as witnesses of the Divine
love. <span id="fr_1624"></span>[1625](#fn_1624) They all pursue the
same mode of life; they are sedulous about the priests and the houses of
prayer, and are munificent to needy strangers and the poor. These
sisters generally take their meals and walks together, and pass their
days and their nights in company, singing the praises of God. As is the
custom with exemplary women, they employ themselves in weaving and in
similar occupations. Although princesses, born and educated in palaces,
they avoid levity and idleness, which they think unworthy of any who
profess virginity, so they put such indolence far from their own life.
For this reason the mercy of God is manifested and is conquering in
behalf of their house; for He increases the emperor in years and
government; every conspiracy and war concocted against him has been
overthrown of itself.
