id="ii.vi.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Death of the Emperor
Jovian.*

<span id="ii.vi.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="c11"><span
id="ii.vi.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Thus</span> did the emperor repress at that
time the impetuosity of those who were disposed to cavil: and
immediately departing from Antioch, he went to Tarsus in Cilicia, where
he duly performed the funeral obsequies of Julian, after which he was
declared consul. Proceeding thence directly to Constantinople, he
arrived at a place named Dadastana, situated on the frontiers of Galatia
and Bithynia. There Themistius the philosopher, with others of the
senatorial order, met him, and pronounced the consular oration before
him, which he afterwards recited before the people at Constantinople.
And indeed the Roman empire, blest with so excellent a sovereign, would
doubtless have flourished exceedingly, as it is likely that both the
civil and ecclesiastical departments would have been happily
administered, had not his sudden death bereft the state of so eminent a
personage. For disease caused by some obstruction, having attacked him
at the place above mentioned during the winter season, he died there on
the 17th day of February, in his own and his son Varronian’s
consulate, <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567) in the thirty-third
year of his age, after having reigned seven months.

<span id="ii.vi.xxvi-p4"></span>This book contains an account of the
events which took place in the space of two years and five months.
