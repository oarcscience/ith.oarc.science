<p class="c16"><a name="v.LXVII-p2"></A>Jerome having written him a short letter (no longer extant) Augustine now replies. He speaks with approval of Jerome&#146;s treatise <i>On Famous Men</i>, incorrectly called the <i>Epitaph</i> (see Letter CXII. &sect;3). He also repeats his objections to Jerome&#146;s account of the quarrel between Paul and Peter at Antioch and then concludes with a request that he will draw up a short notice of the principal heresies condemned by the Church.</p>  
<p><a name="v.LXVII-p3"></A>Like the preceding letter of Augustine (Letter LVI.) this also failed to reach Jerome. It was however published in the West, but without Augustine&#146;s knowledge and by degrees its contents found their way to Bethlehem where they caused much annoyance and pain. The date of the letter is 397 <span class="c17"><a name="v.LXVII-p3.1"></A>a.d.</span> In Augustine&#146;s correspondence in this Library it is printed in full as Letter XL.</p>
