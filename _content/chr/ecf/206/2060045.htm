<p class="c16"><a name="v.XXXIV-p2"></A>In reply to a request from Marcella for information concerning two phrases in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#000">Ps. cxxvii.</a><a name="v.XXXIV-p2.1"></A> (&#8220;bread of sorrow,&#8221; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#002">Psa. 127.2</a><a name="v.XXXIV-p2.2"></A>, and &#8220;children of the shaken off,&#8221; A.V. &#8220;of the youth,&#8221; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#004">Psa. 127.4</a><a name="v.XXXIV-p2.3"></A>). Jerome, after lamenting that Origen&#146;s notes on the psalm are no longer extant, gives the following explanations:</p>  
<p><a name="v.XXXIV-p3"></A>The Hebrew phrase &#8220;bread of sorrow&#8221; is rendered by the LXX. &#8220;bread of idols&#8221;; by Aquila, &#8220;bread of troubles&#8221;; by Symmachus, &#8220;bread of misery.&#8221; Theodotion follows the LXX. So does Origen&#146;s Fifth Version. The Sixth renders &#8220;bread of error.&#8221; In support of the LXX. the word used here is in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004">Ps. cxv. 4</a><a name="v.XXXIV-p3.1"></A>, translated &#8220;idols.&#8221; Either the troubles of life are meant or else the tenets of heresy.</p>  
<p><a name="v.XXXIV-p4"></A>With the second phrase he deals at greater length. After showing that Hilary of Poitiers&#146;s view (viz. that the persons meant are the apostles, who were told to shake the dust off their feet, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#014">Matt. x. 14</a><a name="v.XXXIV-p4.1"></A>) is untenable and would require &#8220;shakers off&#8221; to be substituted for &#8220;shaken off,&#8221; Jerome reverts to the Hebrew as before and declares that the true rendering is that of Symmachus and Theodotion, viz. &#8220;children of youth.&#8221; He points out that the LXX. (by whom the Latin translators had been misled) fall into the same mistake at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#016">Neh. iv. 16</a><a name="v.XXXIV-p4.2"></A>. Finally he corrects a slip of Hilary as to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#002">Ps. cxxviii. 2</a><a name="v.XXXIV-p4.3"></A>, where, through a misunderstanding of the LXX., the latter had substituted &#8220;the labors of thy fruits&#8221; for &#8220;the labors of thy hands.&#8221; He speaks throughout with high respect of Hilary, and says that it was not the bishop&#146;s fault that he was ignorant of Hebrew. The date of the letter is probably <span class="c17"><a name="v.XXXIV-p4.4"></A>a.d.</span> 384.</p>
