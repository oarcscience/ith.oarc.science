<span id="v.CXXXVII"></span>

<span id="v.CXXXVII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXXVII-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXVII. From Pope Innocent to John,
Bishop of Jerusalem.</span>

<span id="v.CXXXVII-p2"></span>Innocent censures John for having allowed
the Pelagians to effuse the disturbance at Bethlehem mentioned in the
two preceding letters and exhorts him to be more watchful over his
diocese in future. The date of the letter is <span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXXXVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 417. This was the year of the
death of both John and Innocent, and it is probable that John never
received the letter.

<span id="v.CXXXVII-p3"></span>Innocent to his most highly esteemed
brother John.

<span id="v.CXXXVII-p4"></span>The holy virgins Eustochium and
Paula <span id="fr_3886"></span>[3887](#fn_3886) have deplored to me the
ravages, murders, fires and outrages of all kinds, which they say that
the devil has perpetrated in the district belonging to their church; for
with wonderful clemency and generosity they have left untold the name
and motive of his human agent. Now although there can be no doubt as to
who is the guilty person; <span id="fr_3887"></span>[3888](#fn_3887) yet
you, my brother, ought to have taken precautions and to have been more
careful of your flock so that no disturbance of the kind might arise;
for others suffer by your negligence, and you encourage men by it to
make havoc of the Lord’s flock till His tender lambs, fleeced and
weakened by fire, sword and persecution, their relations murdered and
dead, are, as we are informed, themselves scarce alive. Does it not
touch your sacred responsibility as a priest <span
id="fr_3888"></span>[3889](#fn_3888) that the devil has shewn himself so
powerful against you and yours? Against you, I say; for surely it speaks
ill of your capacity as a priest that a crime so terrible should have
been committed in the pale of your church. Where were your precautions?
Where, after the blow had been struck, were your attempts at relief?
Where too were your words of comfort? These ladies tell me that up to
the present they have been in a state of too great apprehension to
complain of what they have already suffered. I should judge more gravely
of the matter had they spoken to me concerning it more freely than they
have. Beware then, brother, of the wiles of the old enemy, and in the
spirit of a good ruler be vigilant either to correct or to repress such
evils. For they have reached my ears in the shape of rumours rather than
as specific accusations. If nothing is done, the law of the Church on
the subject of injuries may compel the person who has failed to defend
his flock to shew cause for his negligence.
