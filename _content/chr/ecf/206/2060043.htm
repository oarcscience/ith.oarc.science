<p class="c30"><a name="v.XXXII-p1"></A>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.XXXII-p1.1"></A>Letter XXXII. To Marcella.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.XXXII-p2"></A>Jerome writes that he is busy collating Aquila&#146;s Greek version of the Old Testament with the Hebrew, inquires after Marcella&#146;s mother, and forwards the two preceding letters (XXX., XXXI.). Written at Rome in 384 <span class="c17"><a name="v.XXXII-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.XXXII-p3"></A>1. There are two reasons for the shortness of this letter, one that its bearer is impatient <A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A> <a name="v.XXXII-Page_46"></A>to start, and the other that I am too busy to waste time on trifles. You ask what business can be so urgent as to stop me from a chat on paper. Let me tell you, then, that for some time past I have been comparing Aquila&#146;s version&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_743"></A><A HREF="#fn_743"><FONT SIZE="1">744</FONT></A>
 of the Old Testament with the scrolls of the Hebrew, to see if from hatred to Christ the synagogue has changed the text; and&#8212;to speak frankly to a friend&#8212;I have found several variations which confirm our faith. After having exactly revised the prophets, Solomon,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_744"></A><A HREF="#fn_744"><FONT SIZE="1">745</FONT></A>
 the psalter, and the books of Kings, I am now engaged on Exodus (called by the Jews, from its opening words, Eleh shem&ocirc;th&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_745"></A><A HREF="#fn_745"><FONT SIZE="1">746</FONT></A>
), and when I have finished this I shall go on to Leviticus. Now you see why I can let no claim for a letter withdraw me from my work. However, as I do not wish my friend Currentius&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_746"></A><A HREF="#fn_746"><FONT SIZE="1">747</FONT></A>
 to run altogether in vain, I have tacked on to this little talk two letters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_747"></A><A HREF="#fn_747"><FONT SIZE="1">748</FONT></A>
 which I am sending to your sister Paula, and to her dear child Eustochium. Read these, and if you find them instructive or pleasant, take what I have said to them as meant for you also.</p>  
<p><a name="v.XXXII-p9"></A>2. I hope that Albina, your mother and mine, is well. In bodily health, I mean, for I doubt not of her spiritual welfare. Pray salute her for me, and cherish her with double affection, both as a Christian and as a mother.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="v.XXXII-p4"></A> This version, made in the reign of Hadrian by a Jewish proselyte who is said by some to have been a renegade Christian, was marked by an exaggerated literalism and a close following of the Hebrew original. By the Church it was regarded with suspicion as being designedly anti-Christian. Jerome, however, here acquits Aquila of the charge brought against him.</p>
