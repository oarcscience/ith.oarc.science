<span id="v.LIX-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LIX-p1.1"></span>Letter LIX. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.LIX-p2"></span>An answer to five questions put to Jerome by
Marcella in a letter not preserved. The questions are as follows.

<span id="v.LIX-p3"></span>(1) What are the things which eye hath not
seen nor ear heard ([1 Cor. ii. 9](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#009)<span
id="v.LIX-p3.1"></span>)? Jerome answers that they are spiritual things
which as such can only be spiritually discerned.

<span id="v.LIX-p4"></span>(2) Is it not a mistake to identify the sheep
and the goats of Christ’s parable ([Matt. xxv.
31](../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#031)<span id="v.LIX-p4.1"></span> sqq.)
with Christians and heathens? Are they not rather the good and the bad?
For an answer to this question Jerome refers Marcella to his treatise
against Jovinian (II. §§18–23).

<span id="v.LIX-p5"></span>(3) Paul says that some shall be “alive and
remain unto the coming of the Lord;” and that they shall be “caught up
to meet the Lord in the air” ([1 Thess.
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#015),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017)<span id="v.LIX-p5.1"></span>). Are
we to suppose this assumption to be corporeal and that those assumed
will escape death? Yes, Jerome answers, but their bodies will be
glorified.

<span id="v.LIX-p6"></span>(4) How is [John xx.
17](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#017)<span id="v.LIX-p6.1"></span>,
“touch me not,” to be reconciled with [Matt. xxviii.
9](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#009)<span id="v.LIX-p6.2"></span>, “they
came and held him by the feet”? In the one case, Jerome replies, Mary
Magdalen failed to recognize the divinity of Jesus; in the other the
women recognized it. Accordingly they were admitted to a privilege which
was denied to her.

<span id="v.LIX-p7"></span>(5) Was the risen Christ before His ascension
present only with the disciples, or was He in heaven and elsewhere as
well? The latter according to Jerome is the true doctrine. “The Divine
Nature,” he writes, “exists everywhere in its entirety. Christ,
therefore, was at one and the same time with the apostles and with the
angels; in the Father and in the uttermost parts of the sea. So
afterwards he was with Thomas in India, with Peter at Rome, with Paul in
Illyricum, with Titus in Crete, with Andrew in Achaia.” The date of the
letter is <span class="c17"><span id="v.LIX-p7.1"></span>a.d.</span> 395
or <span class="c17"><span id="v.LIX-p7.2"></span>a.d.</span> 396.
