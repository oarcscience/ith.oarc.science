<span id="v.CX-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CX-p1.1"></span>Letter CX. From Augustine.</span>

<span id="v.CX-p2"></span>Augustine’s answer to Letter CII. He now tries
to soothe Jerome’s wounded feelings, begs him to overlook the offence
that he has committed, and implores him not to break off the friendly
relations hitherto maintained between them. He touches on the quarrel
between Jerome and Rufinus and sincerely hopes that no such breach may
ever separate Jerome from himself. The tone of the letter is throughout
conciliatory and is marked in places with deep feeling. More than once
Augustine dwells on Jerome’s words (“would that I could embrace you and
that by mutual converse we might learn one from the other,” Letter CII.
§2) and speaks of the comfort which they have brought to him.

<span id="v.CX-p3"></span>The date of the letter is 404 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.CX-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>
