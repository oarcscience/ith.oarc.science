<p class="c30"><a name="v.LXXXVIII-p1"></A>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.LXXXVIII-p1.1"></A>Letter LXXXVIII. To Theophilus.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.LXXXVIII-p2"></A>Replying to the preceding letter Jerome again congratulates Theophilus on the success of his efforts to put down Origenism, and informs him that they have already borne fruit as far west as Italy. He then asks him for the decrees of his council (held recently at Alexandria). The date of the letter is 400 <span class="c17"><a name="v.LXXXVIII-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.LXXXVIII-p3"></A>Jerome to the most blessed pope Theophilus. The letter of your holiness has given me a twofold pleasure, partly because it has had for its bearers those reverend and estimable men, the bishop Agatho and the deacon Athanasius, and partly because it has shewn your zeal for the faith against a most wicked heresy. The voice of your holiness has rung throughout the world, and to the joy of all Christ&#146;s churches the poisonous suggestions of the devil have been silenced. The old serpent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2620"></A><A HREF="#fn_2620"><FONT SIZE="1">2621</FONT></A>
 hisses no longer, but, writhing and disembowelled, lurks in dark caverns unable to bear the shining of the sun. I have already, before the writing of your letter, sent missives to the West pointing out to those of my own language some of the quibbles employed by the heretics. I hold it due to the special providence of God that you should have written to the pope Anastasius&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2621"></A><A HREF="#fn_2621"><FONT SIZE="1">2622</FONT></A>
 at the same time as myself, and should thus without knowing it have been the means of confirming my testimony. Now that you have directly urged me to do so, I shall shew myself more zealous than ever to recall from their error simple souls both near and far. Nor shall I hesitate, if needful, to incur odium with some, for we ought to please God rather than men:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2622"></A><A HREF="#fn_2622"><FONT SIZE="1">2623</FONT></A>
 although indeed they have been much more forward to defend their heresy than I and others have been to attack it. At the same time I beg that if you have any synodical decrees bearing upon the subject you will forward them to me, that, strengthened with the authority of so great a prelate, I may open my mouth for Christ with more freedom and confidence. The presbyter Vincent has arrived from Rome two days ago and humbly salutes you. He tells me again and again that Rome and almost the whole of Italy owe their deliverance after Christ to your letters. Shew diligence therefore, most loving and most blessed pope, and whenever opportunity offers write to the bishops of the West not to hesitate&#8212;in your own words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2623"></A><A HREF="#fn_2623"><FONT SIZE="1">2624</FONT></A>
&#8212;to cut down with a sharp sickle the sprouts of evil.</p>
