<span id="v.CXXXV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXXXV-p1.1"></span>Letter CXXXV. From Pope Innocent to
Aurelius.</span>

<span id="v.CXXXV-p2"></span>Shortly after the synod of Diospolis the
Pelagians exulting in their success made an attack upon Jerome’s
monasteries at Bethlehem which they pillaged and partially burned. This
gained for him the sympathy of Innocent who now (<span class="c17"><span
id="v.CXXXV-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 417) asks Aurelius to transmit to
him the letter which follows this.

<span id="v.CXXXV-p3"></span>Innocent to his most esteemed friend and
brother Aurelius. <span id="fr_3882"></span>[3883](#fn_3882)

<span id="v.CXXXV-p5"></span>Our fellow-presbyter Jerome has informed us
of your most dutiful desire to come to see us. We suffer with him as
with a member of our own flock. We have been swift also to take such
measures as have appeared to us expedient and practicable. As you count
yourself one of us, most dear brother, make haste to transmit the
following letter <span id="fr_3883"></span>[3884](#fn_3883) to the
aforesaid Jerome.
