<span id="v.XVI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XVI-p1.1"></span>Letter XVI. To Pope Damasus.</span>

<span id="v.XVI-p2"></span>This letter, written a few months after the
preceding, is another appeal to Damasus to solve the writer’s doubts.
Jerome once more refers to his baptism at Rome, and declares that his
one answer to the factions at Antioch is, “He who clings to the chair of
Peter is accepted by me.” Written from the desert in the year 377 or
378.

<span id="v.XVI-p3"></span>1. By her importunity the widow in the gospel
at last gained a hearing, <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293) and by
the same means one friend induced another to give him bread at midnight,
when his door was shut and his servants were in bed. <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294) The publican’s prayers overcame
God, <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295) although God is invincible.
Nineveh was saved by its tears from the impending ruin caused by its
sin. <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296) To what end, you ask, these
far-fetched references? To this end, I make answer; that you in your
greatness should look upon me in my littleness; that you, the rich
shepherd, should not despise me, the ailing sheep. Christ Himself
brought the robber from the cross to paradise, <span
id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297) and, to show that repentance is never
too late, He turned a murderer’s death into a martyrdom. Gladly does
Christ embrace the prodigal son when he returns to Him; <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298) and, leaving the ninety and nine, the
good shepherd carries home on His shoulders the one poor sheep that is
left. <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299) From a persecutor Paul
becomes a preacher. His bodily eyes are blinded to clear the eyes of his
soul, <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300) and he who once haled
Christ’s servants in chains before the council of the Jews, <span
id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301) lives afterwards to glory in the bonds
of Christ. <span id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302)

<span id="v.XVI-p14"></span>2. As I have already written to you, <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303) I, who have received Christ’s garb in
Rome, am now detained in the waste that borders Syria. No sentence of
banishment, however, has been passed upon me; the punishment which I am
undergoing is self-inflicted. But, as the heathen poet says:

<span id="v.XVI-p16"></span>They change not mind but sky who cross the
sea. <span id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304)

<span id="v.XVI-p18"></span>The untiring foe follows me closely, and the
assaults that I suffer in the desert are severer than ever. For the
Arian frenzy raves, and the powers of the world support it. The church
is rent into three factions, and each of these is eager to seize me for
its own. The influence of the monks is of long standing, and it is
directed against me. I meantime keep crying: “He who clings to the chair
of Peter is accepted by me.” Meletius, Vitalis, and Paulinus <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305) all profess to cleave to you, and I
could believe the assertion if it were made by one of them only. As it
is, either two of them or else all three are guilty of falsehood.
Therefore I implore your blessedness, by our Lord’s cross and passion,
those necessary glories of our faith, as you hold an apostolic office,
to give an apostolic decision. Only tell me by letter with whom I am to
communicate in Syria, and I will pray for you that you may sit in
judgment enthroned with the twelve; <span
id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306) that when you grow old, like Peter,
you may be girded not by yourself but by another, <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307) and that, like Paul, you may be made a
citizen of the heavenly kingdom. <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308)
Do not despise a soul for which Christ died.

<span id="v.XVI-p19"></span> The three rival claimants of the see of
Antioch. Paulinus and Meletius were both orthodox, but Meletius derived
his orders from the Arians and was consequently not recognized in the
West. In the East, however, he was so highly esteemed that some years
after this he was chosen to preside over the Council of Constantinople
(<span class="c17"><span id="v.XVI-p19.1"></span>a.d.</span> 391).
Vitalis, the remaining claimant, was a follower of Apollinaris, but much
respected by the orthodox on account of his high character.
