<span id="vii.iii.xx-p2"></span>*The Preface is to Chromatius and
Heliodorus. It recognizes that the books are apocryphal. After his usual
complaints of “the Pharisees” who impugned his translations, he says:
“Inasmuch as the Chaldee is closely allied to the Hebrew, I procured the
help of the most skilful speaker of both languages I could find, and
gave to the subject one day’s hasty labour, my method being to explain
in Latin, with the aid of a secretary, whatever an interpreter expressed
to me in Hebrew words.” As to Judith, he notes that the Council of Nicæa
had, contrary to the Hebrew tradition, included it in the Canon of
Scripture, and this, with his friends’ requests, had induced him to
undertake the labour of emendation and translation.*
