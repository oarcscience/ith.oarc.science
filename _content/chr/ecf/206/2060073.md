<span id="v.LXII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXII. To Tranquillinus.</span>

<span id="v.LXII-p2"></span>Tranquillinus, one of Jerome’s Roman
friends, had written (1) to tell him of the stand that Oceanus was
making against the Origenists at Rome, and (2) to ask whether any parts
of Origen’s works might be studied with safety and profit. Jerome
welcomes the tidings about Oceanus and answers the question of
Tranquillinus in the affirmative. He classes Origen with Tertullian,
Apollinaris and others whose works continued to be read in spite of
their heresies. Written in 396 or 397 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXII-p3"></span>1. Though I formerly doubted the fact, I
have now proved that the links which bind spirit to spirit are stronger
than any physical bond. For you, my reverend friend, cling to me with
all your soul, and I am united to you by the love of Christ. I speak
simply and sincerely to your spotless heart: the very paper on which you
write, the very letters which you have formed—voiceless though they
are—inspire in me a sense of your affection.

<span id="v.LXII-p4"></span>2. You tell me that many have been deceived
by the mistaken teaching of Origen, and that that saintly man, my son
Oceanus, is doing battle with their madness. I grieve to think that
simple folk have been thrown off their balance, but I am rejoiced to
know that one so learned as Oceanus is doing his best to set them right
again. Moreover you ask me, insignificant though I am, for an opinion as
to the advisability of reading Origen’s works. Are we, you say, to
reject him altogether with our brother Faustinus, or are we, as others
tell us, to read him in part? My opinion is that we should sometimes
read him for his learning just as we read Tertullian, Novatus, Arnobius,
Apollinarius and some other church writers both Greek and Latin, and
that we should select what is good and avoid what is bad in their
writings according to the words of the Apostle, “Prove all things: hold
fast that which is good.” <span id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909)
Those, however, who are led by some perversity in their dispositions to
conceive for him too much fondness or too much aversion seem to me to
lie under the <span id="page_134">p. 134</span> <span
id="v.LXII-Page_134"></span>curse of the Prophet:—“Woe unto them that
call evil good and good evil; that put bitter for sweet and sweet for
bitter!” <span id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910) For while the
ability of his teaching must not lead us to embrace his wrong opinions,
the wrongness of his opinions should not cause us altogether to reject
the useful commentaries which he has published on the holy scriptures.
But if his admirers and his detractors are bent on having a tug of war
one against the other, and if, seeking no mean and observing no
moderation, they must either approve or disapprove his works
indiscriminately, I would choose rather to be a pious boor than a
learned blasphemer. Our reverend brother, Tatian the deacon, heartily
salutes you.
