<span id="vii.iii.iii-p2"></span>*The Preface to these books was written
<span class="c17"><span id="vii.iii.iii-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> 404;
Jerome speaks of the death of Paula, which took place in that year, and
the work is addressed to Eustochium alone. The Preface is chiefly
occupied with a defence of his translation. He tells those who carp at
it that they are not bound to read it, and mentions that the Church had
given no final sanction to the LXX., but read the book of Daniel in
Theodotion’s version. The books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth, were
probably the last of the Vulgate translation; the Preface declares
Jerome’s intention of devoting himself henceforward to the Commentaries
on the Prophets, a work which took up the remainder of his life.*
