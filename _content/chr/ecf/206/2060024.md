<span id="v.XIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XIII. To Castorina, His Maternal
Aunt.</span>

<span id="v.XIII-p2"></span>An interesting letter, as throwing some
light on Jerome’s family relations. Castorina, his maternal aunt, had,
for some reason, become estranged from him, and he now writes to her to
effect a reconciliation. Whether he succeeded in doing so, we do not
know. The date of the letter is 374 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XIII-p3"></span>The apostle and evangelist John rightly
says, in his first epistle, that “whosoever hateth his brother is a
murderer.” <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167) For, since murder
often springs from hate, the hater, even though he has not yet slain his
victim, is at heart a murderer. Why, you ask, do I begin in this style?
Simply that you and I may both lay aside past ill feeling and cleanse
our hearts to be a habitation for God. “Be ye angry,” David says, “and
sin not,” or, as the apostle more fully expresses it, “let not the sun
go down upon your wrath.” <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168) What
then shall *we* do in the day of judgment, upon whose wrath the sun has
gone down not one day but many years? The Lord says in the Gospel: “If
thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother
hath aught against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go
thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
gift.” <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169) Woe to me, wretch that I
am; woe, I had almost said, to you also. This long time past we have
either offered no gift at the altar or have offered it whilst cherishing
anger “without a cause.” How have we been able in our daily prayers to
say “Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors,” <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170) whilst our feelings have been at
variance with our words, and our petition inconsistent with our conduct?
Therefore I renew the prayer which I made a year ago in a previous
letter, <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171) that the Lord’s legacy
of peace <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172) may be indeed ours, and
that my desires and your feelings may find favor in His sight. Soon we
shall stand before His judgment seat to receive the reward of harmony
restored or to pay the penalty for harmony broken. In case you shall
prove unwilling—I hope that it may not be so—to accept my advances, I
for my part shall be free. For this letter, when it is read, will insure
my acquittal.
