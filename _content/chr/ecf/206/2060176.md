<span id="vi.ix.II"></span>

<span id="vi.ix.II-p1"></span> <span class="c14"><span
id="vi.ix.II-p1.1"></span>Book II.</span>

<span id="vi.ix.II-p2"></span>This book can hardly be said to form part
of a dialogue. It is rather an argument from Scripture to prove the
point of the Augustinian arguer, Atticus. From the fourth chapter
onwards it consists, like the last five chapters of Book I., of a chain
of Scripture texts, taken from the New Testament and the Prophets, to
show the universality of sin, and thus to refute the Pelagian assertion
that a man can be without sin if he wills. We shall, therefore, give, as
in the previous case, a list of the texts and the first words of them,
only giving Jerome’s words where he introduces some original remark of
his own, or some noteworthy comment.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p3"></span>The Pelagian begins by reiterating the
dilemma: If the commandments are given to be obeyed, then man can be
without sin; if he is, by his creation, such that he must be a sinner,
then God, not he, is the author of sin. To the argument that sacrifices
are enjoined for sins of ignorance, he replies by appealing from the Old
Testament to the New, which leads to a discussion (2, 3) on St. Paul’s
description of the conflict with sin, in [Romans
vii](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#000)<span id="vi.ix.II-p3.1"></span>.
Paul, it is argued, speaks not as a sinner, but as a *man*, and thus
confesses the sinfulness of humanity. That men may be without ingrained
vice is possible; that they can be without sin is not. This leads the
Augustinian, Atticus, resuming his list of testimonies, to the fact
that, though men are found who are righteous as avoiding wickedness
(<span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix.II-p3.2"></span>κακία</span>), yet
none is without sin (<span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix.II-p3.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="vi.ix.II-p3.4"></span>ναμάρτητος</span> ).

<span id="vi.ix.II-p4"></span>In [Psalm xxxii.
5](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#005)<span id="vi.ix.II-p4.1"></span>. One
who speaks of himself as “holy,” yet confesses his transgression.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p5"></span>[Prov. xxiv.
16](../../../bib/kjv/pro024.htm#016)<span id="vi.ix.II-p5.1"></span>.
Explains this, “The righteous falls, but sins again.”

<span id="vi.ix.II-p6"></span>[Prov.
18.17](../../../bib/kjv/pro018.htm#017)<span id="vi.ix.II-p6.1"></span>,
LXX. and Vulgate. A righteous man accuses himself when he begins to
speak.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p7"></span>[Ps. lviii.
3](../../../bib/kjv/psa058.htm#003)<span id="vi.ix.II-p7.1"></span>.
Sinners are estranged from the womb; that is, either, as St. Paul says
([Rom. v. 14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014)<span
id="vi.ix.II-p7.2"></span>), they sin “after the similitude of Adam”;
or, “when Christ, as the firstborn, opened the virgin’s womb” ([Exod.
xiii. 2](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002)<span
id="vi.ix.II-p7.3"></span>). The heretics refused to acknowledge the
mystery, which was prefigured by the Eastern door of the Temple ([Ezek.
xliv. 2](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#002)<span
id="vi.ix.II-p7.4"></span>), which closed again when once the High
Priest had gone through it. <span id="fr_5256"></span>[5257](#fn_5256)

<span id="vi.ix.II-p9"></span>[Job iv.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p10"></span>[Job
7.1](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#001)<span id="vi.ix.II-p10.1"></span>.
The life of man is temptation.

7:20](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#020),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/job007.htm#021)<span id="vi.ix.II-p11.1"></span>.
If I have sinned, what can I do?

9:15](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#015),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#016)<span id="vi.ix.II-p12.1"></span>.
If I were righteous, he would not hear me.

9.29-31](../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#029)<span
id="vi.ix.II-p13.1"></span>. If I wash myself with snow water, etc.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p14"></span>[Job.
10.15](../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#015)<span

14:4](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#004),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#005)<span id="vi.ix.II-p15.1"></span>.
Who will be free from uncleanliness? Not one.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p16"></span>[Prov. xvi.
26](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#026)<span id="vi.ix.II-p16.1"></span>,
LXX. Man toileth in sorrow.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p17"></span>[Job xl.
4](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#004)<span id="vi.ix.II-p17.1"></span>.
What shall I answer thee?

<span id="vi.ix.II-p18"></span>[Prov. xx.
9](../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#009)<span id="vi.ix.II-p18.1"></span>.
“Who will boast that he has a clean heart?” which shows at least that
the commandments are not easy, as Pelagius says they are.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p19"></span>[1 John v.
3](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#003)<span id="vi.ix.II-p19.1"></span>.
“His commandments are not grievous,” and

<span id="vi.ix.II-p20"></span>[Matt. xi.
30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030)<span id="vi.ix.II-p20.1"></span>.
“My yoke is easy,” are true only in comparison with Judaism, and should
be compared with

<span id="vi.ix.II-p21"></span>[Acts xv.
10](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#010)<span id="vi.ix.II-p21.1"></span>. A
yoke …which neither our fathers nor we are able to bear.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p22"></span>[James iv.
11](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011)<span id="vi.ix.II-p22.1"></span>.
“Thou judgest the law,” that is, if you say that the condemnation of
sins of ignorance is unreasonable. That we all sin in such ways is
evident from

<span id="vi.ix.II-p23"></span><span id="page_467">p. 467</span> <span
id="vi.ix.II-Page_467"></span>[James i.
20](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#020)<span id="vi.ix.II-p23.1"></span>.
“The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.” But anger is
constantly condemned as in

<span id="vi.ix.II-p24"></span>[Prov. xv.
1](../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001)<span id="vi.ix.II-p24.1"></span>,
LXX. “Wrath destroys even wise men.”

<span id="vi.ix.II-p25"></span>[Eph. iv.
26](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026)<span id="vi.ix.II-p25.1"></span>.
Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p26"></span>[Matt. v.
22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)<span id="vi.ix.II-p26.1"></span>.
He who is angry…shall be in danger of council.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p27"></span>[Eccles. xi.
19](../../../bib/kjv/ecc011.htm#019)<span id="vi.ix.II-p27.1"></span>.
“I am the most foolish of all men.” This is said by Christ in the person
of humanity. So

<span id="vi.ix.II-p28"></span>[Ps. lxix.
5](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#005)<span id="vi.ix.II-p28.1"></span>.
“God, Thou knowest my foolishness.” But

<span id="vi.ix.II-p29"></span>[1 Cor. i.
25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025)<span id="vi.ix.II-p29.1"></span>.
The foolishness of God is wiser than men.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p30"></span>[Ecclesiasticus
1.18](../../../bib/apo/sir001.htm#018)<span id="vi.ix.II-p30.1"></span>.
“In much wisdom is much grief,” shows the wise man’s sense of
imperfection. So

<span id="vi.ix.II-p31"></span>[Ecclesiasticus
8.7](../../../bib/apo/sir008.htm#007)<span id="vi.ix.II-p31.1"></span>.
“I hated my life,” and

<span id="vi.ix.II-p32"></span>[Ecclesiasticus
8.14](../../../bib/apo/sir008.htm#014)<span id="vi.ix.II-p32.1"></span>.
“There be righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of
the wicked;” that is, God sees evil where we do not.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p33"></span>[Ecclesiasticus
8.17](../../../bib/apo/sir008.htm#017)<span id="vi.ix.II-p33.1"></span>.
“However much a man may labor, yet he shall not find it;” and

<span id="vi.ix.II-p34"></span>[Sir.
9:2](../../../bib/apo/sir009.htm#002),
[3](../../../bib/apo/sir009.htm#003)<span id="vi.ix.II-p34.1"></span>.
There is one event to all. The heart…is full of evil.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p35"></span>[Ecclesiasticus
10.1](../../../bib/apo/sir010.htm#001)<span id="vi.ix.II-p35.1"></span>.
“Dead flies cause the ointment to stink;” That is, almost everyone is
defiled by heresy or other faults.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p36"></span>[1 Pet.
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018)<span id="vi.ix.II-p36.1"></span>.
Judgement must begin at the house of God.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p37"></span>6. There are four emotions which agitate
mankind, two relating to the present, two to the future; two to good,
and two to evil. There is sorrow, called in Greek <span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix.II-p37.1"></span>λύπη</span>, and joy, in
Greek <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix.II-p37.2"></span>χαρά</span>
or <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix.II-p37.3"></span>ἡ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="vi.ix.II-p37.4"></span>δονή</span>, although
many translate the latter word by *voluptas,* pleasure; the one of which
is referred to evil, the other to good. And we go too far if we rejoice
over such things as we ought not, as, for example, riches, power,
distinctions, the bad fortune of enemies, or their death; or, on the
other hand, if we are tortured with grief on account of present evils,
adversity, exile, poverty, weakness, and the death of kindred, all of
which is forbidden by the Apostle. And again, if we covet those things
which we consider good, inheritance, distinctions, unvaried prosperity,
bodily health, and the like, in the possession of which we rejoice and
find enjoyment; or if we fear those things which we deem adverse. Now,
according to the Stoics, Zeno that is to say and Chrysippus, it is
possible for a perfect man to be free from these emotions; according to
the Peripatetics, it is difficult and even impossible, an opinion which
has the constant support of all Scripture. Hence Josephus, the historian
of the Maccabees, said that the emotions can be subdued and governed,
not extirpated, and Cicero’s five books of “Tusculan Disputations” are
full of these discussions. <span id="fr_5257"></span>[5258](#fn_5257)
According to the Apostle, the weakness of the body and spiritual hosts
of wickedness in the heavenly places fight against us. And the same
writer <span id="fr_5258"></span>[5259](#fn_5258) tells us that the
works of the flesh and the works of the spirit are manifest, and these
are contrary the one to the other, so that we do not the things that we
would. If we do not what we would, but what we would not, how can you
say that a man can be without sin if he chooses? You see that neither an
Apostle, nor any believer can perform what he wishes. <span
id="fr_5259"></span>[5260](#fn_5259) “Love covereth a multitude of
sins,” not so much sins of the past as sins of the present, that we may
not sin any more while the love of God abideth in us. Wherefore it is
said concerning the woman that was a sinner, <span
id="fr_5260"></span>[5261](#fn_5260) “Her sins which are many are
forgiven her, for she loved much.” And this shows us that the doing what
we wish does not depend merely upon our own power, but upon the
assistance which God in His mercy gives to our will.

continued:

therefore is darkness.

Prince of Tyre ([Ezek. xxviii. 3](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003)<span
id="vi.ix.II-p44.2"></span>), are wise derivatively. So we are pure, but
only by grace. Thus

“Every man who is angry…shall be in danger of the council.” Which of us

“First be reconciled to thy brother.” Who is there that finds this

“Let your speech be Yea, yea, Nay, nay.” Who has ever kept this
commandment? The Psalmist says [Ps. cxvi.
11](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#011)<span id="vi.ix.II-p77.2"></span>.
All men are liars.

“On whom shall I rest but on him that is humble?” Christ finds few on
whom to rest. How then can His commands be said to be easy?

come. So

Joshua is represented as clothed in filthy garments, and is freed
through God’s mercy.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p201"></span>But Jovinian’s heir says “I am quite
free from sin, I have no filthy garments, I am governed by my own will,
I am greater than an Apostle. The Apostle does what he would not, and
what he would he does not; but I do what I will, and what I would not I
do not: the kingdom of heaven has been prepared for me, or rather I have
by my virtuous life prepared it for myself. Adam was subject to
punishment, and so are others who think themselves guilty after the
similitude of Adam’s transgressions; I and my crew alone have nothing to
fear. Other men shut up in their cells and who never see women, because,
poor creatures! they do not listen to my words, are tormented with
desire: crowds of women may surround me, I feel no stirring of
concupiscence. For to me may be applied the <span
id="fr_5264"></span>[5265](#fn_5264) words, ‘Holy stones are rolled upon
the ground,’ and the reason why I am insensible to the attraction of sin
is that in the power of free will I carry Christ’s trophy about with
me.” But let us listen to God <span id="fr_5265"></span>[5266](#fn_5265)
proclaiming by the mouth of Isaiah: “O my people, they which call thee
happy cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.” Who is the
greatest subverter of the people of God—he who, relying on the power of
free choice, despises the help of the Creator, and is satisfied with
following his own will, or he who dreads to be judged by the details of
the Lord’s commandments? To men of this sort, God <span
id="fr_5266"></span>[5267](#fn_5266) says, “Woe unto you that are wise
in your own eyes, and prudent in your own sight.” Isaiah, if we follow
the Hebrew, laments <span id="fr_5267"></span>[5268](#fn_5267) and says,
“Woe is me because I have been silent, because I am a man of unclean
lips: and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for mine
eyes have seen the Lord of Hosts.” He for his meritorious and virtuous
life enjoyed the sight of God, and conscious of his sins confessed that
he had unclean lips. Not that he had said anything repugnant to the will
of God, but because, either from fear, or from a deep sense of shame, he
had been <span id="fr_5268"></span>[5269](#fn_5268) silent, and had not
reproved the errors of the people so freely as a prophet should. When do
we sinners rebuke offenders, we who flatter wealth and accept the
persons of sinners for the sake of filthy lucre? for we shall hardly say
that we speak with perfect frankness to men of whose assistance we stand
in need. Suppose that we do not such things as they, suppose we keep
ourselves from every form of sin; to refrain from speaking the truth is
certainly sin. In the Septuagint, however, we do not find the words
“because I have been silent,” but “because I was pricked,” that is with
the consciousness of sin; and thus the words of the <span
id="fr_5269"></span>[5270](#fn_5269) prophet are fulfilled. “My life was
turned into misery while I was pierced by the thorn.” He was pricked by
the thorn of sin: you are decked with the flowers of virtue. <span
id="fr_5270"></span>[5271](#fn_5270) “The moon shall be ashamed, and the
sun confounded, when the Lord shall punish the host of heaven on high.”
This is explained by another passage. <span
id="fr_5271"></span>[5272](#fn_5271) “Even the stars are unclean in His
sight,” and again, <span id="fr_5272"></span>[5273](#fn_5272) “He
chargeth His angels with folly.” The moon is ashamed, the sun is
confounded, and the sky covered with sackcloth, and shall we fearlessly
and joyously, as though we were free from all sin, face the majesty of
the Judge, when the mountains shall melt away, that is, all who are
lifted up by pride, and all the host of the heavens, whether they be
stars, or angelic powers, when the heavens shall be rolled together as a
scroll, and all their host shall fade away like leaves?

<span id="vi.ix.II-p211"></span>The argument is now carried on mostly by
the quotation of passages from the prophets:

<span id="vi.ix.II-p212"></span>25.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p213"></span>[Is. xxxiv.
5](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#005)<span id="vi.ix.II-p213.1"></span>.
“My sword hath drunk its fill in the heavens. It will come down in
Edom.” How much more is there wrath against sin on earth! Edom means
blood, which cannot inherit the kingdom ([1 Cor. xv.
50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050)<span id="vi.ix.II-p213.2"></span>).

<span id="vi.ix.II-p214"></span>[Isa.
45.9](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#009)<span
id="vi.ix.II-p214.1"></span>. Woe unto him who striveth with his Maker.

When pardoned, Jerusalem will still remember her sin.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p222"></span>Let us confess with shame that these are
the utterances of men who have already won their reward; sinners upon
earth, and still in our frail and mortal bodies let us adopt the
language of the saints in heaven who have even been endowed with
incorruption and immortality. <span id="fr_5274"></span>[5275](#fn_5274)
“And ye say the way of the Lord is not equal, when your ways are not
equal.” It is Pharisaic pride to attribute to the injustice of the
Creator sins which are due to our own will, and to slander His
righteousness. The sons of Zadok, the priests of the spiritual temple,
that is the Church, <span id="fr_5275"></span>[5276](#fn_5275) go not
out to the people in their ministerial robes, lest by human intercourse
they may lose their holiness and be defiled. And do you suppose that
you, in the thick of the throng, and an ordinary individual, are pure?

<span id="vi.ix.II-p225"></span>26. Let us hastily run through the
prophet Jeremiah:

<span id="vi.ix.II-p226"></span>[Jer.

God rejects the sacrifices, because of the worshippers’ evil lives.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p230"></span>[Jerem. xvii.
14](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#014)<span id="vi.ix.II-p230.1"></span>.
“Heal me, O Lord.” Otherwise Jeremiah could only say, as in the text
next quoted,

<span id="vi.ix.II-p231"></span>[Jer.

17](../../../bib/apo/ma2005.htm#017)<span id="vi.ix.II-p250.1"></span>,
which say that Antiochus Epiphanes had power to overthrow the Temple,
“because of the multitude of sins,” are quoted in connection with the
confessions of Daniel.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p251"></span>[Dan. ix.
5](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#005)<span id="vi.ix.II-p251.1"></span>.
“We have sinned and dealt perversely,” which is shown by

<span id="vi.ix.II-p252"></span>[Dan.
9.20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020)<span
id="vi.ix.II-p252.1"></span>. “While I was yet praying,” etc., to be a
personal, not only a national confession.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p253"></span>[Dan.
9.24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)<span
id="vi.ix.II-p253.1"></span>. The prophecy of the seventy weeks shows
that the prophet looked to God alone for the establishment of
righteousness.

<span id="vi.ix.II-p254"></span>So then, until that end shall come, and
this corruptible and mortal shall put on incorruption and immortality,
we must be liable to sin; not, as you falsely say, owing to the fault of
our nature and creation, but through the frailty and fickleness of human
will, which varies from moment to moment; because God alone changeth
not. You ask in what respects Abel, Enoch, Joshua the son of Nun, or
Elisha, and the rest of the saints have sinned. There is no need to look
for a knot in a bulrush; I freely confess I do not know; and I only wish
that, when sins are manifest, I might still be silent. <span
id="fr_5277"></span>[5278](#fn_5277) “I know nothing against myself,”
says St. Paul, “yet am I not hereby justified.” <span
id="fr_5278"></span>[5279](#fn_5278) “Man looketh on the outward
appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” Before Him no man is
justified. And so Paul says confidently, <span
id="fr_5279"></span>[5280](#fn_5279) “All have sinned, and come short of
the glory of God”; and <span id="fr_5280"></span>[5281](#fn_5280) “God
hath shut up all under sin that He may have mercy upon all”; and
similarly in other passages which we have repeated again and again.
