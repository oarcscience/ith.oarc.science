<span id="v.XCVII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XCVII-p1.1"></span>Letter XCVII. To Pammachius and
Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XCVII-p2"></span>With this letter Jerome sends to Pammachius
and Marcella a translation of the paschal letter issued by <span
id="page_187">p. 187</span> <span
id="v.XCVII-Page_187"></span>Theophilus for the year 402 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.XCVII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span> together with the
Greek original. He takes the precaution of sending this latter because
in the preceding year complaints have been made that his translation was
not accurate. Written in 402 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XCVII-p2.2"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XCVII-p3"></span>1. Once more with the return of spring I
enrich you with the wares of the east and send the treasures of
Alexandria to Rome: as it is written, “God shall come from the south and
the Holy One from Mount Paran, even a thick shadow.” <span
id="fr_2644"></span>[2645](#fn_2644) (Hence in the Song of Songs the
joyous cry of the bride: “I sat down under his shadow with great delight
and his fruit was sweet to my taste.” <span
id="fr_2645"></span>[2646](#fn_2645) ) Now truly is Isaiah’s prophecy
fulfilled: “In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the land
of Egypt.” <span id="fr_2646"></span>[2647](#fn_2646) “Where sin hath
abounded, grace doth much more abound.” <span
id="fr_2647"></span>[2648](#fn_2647) They who fostered the infant Christ
now with glowing faith defend Him in His manhood; and they who once
saved Him from the hands of Herod are ready to save Him again from this
blasphemer and heretic. Demetrius expelled Origen from the city of
Alexander; but he is now thanks to Theophilus outlawed from the whole
world. Like him to whom Luke has dedicated the *Acts of the
Apostles <span id="fr_2648"></span>[2649](#fn_2648)* this bishop derives
his name from his love to God. Where now is the wriggling serpent? <span
id="fr_2649"></span>[2650](#fn_2649) In what plight does the venomous
viper find himself? His is

<span id="v.XCVII-p10"></span>A human face with wolfish body
joined. <span id="fr_2650"></span>[2651](#fn_2650)

<span id="v.XCVII-p12"></span>Where now is that heresy which crawled
hissing through the world and boasted that both the bishop Theophilus
and I were partisans of its errors? Where now is the yelping of those
shameless hounds who, to win over the simple minded, falsely proclaimed
our adherence to their cause? Crushed by the authority and eloquence of
Theophilus they are now like demon-spirits only able to mutter and that
from out of the earth. <span id="fr_2651"></span>[2652](#fn_2651) For
they know nothing of Him who, as He comes from above, <span
id="fr_2652"></span>[2653](#fn_2652) speaks only of the things that are
above.

<span id="v.XCVII-p15"></span>2. Would that this generation of
vipers <span id="fr_2653"></span>[2654](#fn_2653) would either honestly
accept our doctrines, or else consistently defend its own; that we might
know whom we are to esteem and whom we are to shun. As it is they have
invented a new kind of penitence, hating us as enemies though they dare
not deny our faith. What, I ask, is this chagrin of theirs which neither
time nor reason seems able to cure? When swords flash in battle and men
fall and blood flows in streams, hostile hands are often clasped in
amity and the fury of war is exchanged for an unexpected peace. The
partisans of this heresy alone can make no terms with churchmen; for
they repudiate mentally the verbal assent that is extorted from them.
When their open blasphemy is made plain to the public ear, and when they
perceive their hearers clamouring against them; then they assume an air
of simplicity, declaring that they hear such doctrines for the first
time and that they have no previous knowledge of them as taught by their
master. And when you hold their writings in your hand, they deny with
their lips what their hands have written. Why, sirs, need you beset the
Propontis, <span id="fr_2654"></span>[2655](#fn_2654) shift your abode,
wander through different countries, and rend with foaming mouths a
distinguished prelate of Christ and his followers? If your recantations
are sincere, you should replace your former zeal for error with an equal
zeal for the faith. Why do you patch together from this quarter and from
that these rags of cursing? And why do you rail at the lives of men
whose faith you cannot resist? Do you cease to be heretics because
according to you sundry persons believe us to be sinners? And does
impiety cease to disfigure your lips because you can point to scars on
our ears? So long as you have a leopard’s spots and an Ethiopian’s
skin, <span id="fr_2655"></span>[2656](#fn_2655) how can it help your
perfidy to know that I too am marked by moles? See, Pope Theophilus is
freely allowed to prove Origen a heretic; and the disciples do not
defend the master’s words. They merely pretend that they have been
altered by heretics and tampered with, like the works of many other
writers. Thus they seek to maintain his cause not by their own belief
but by other people’s errors. So much I would say against heretics who
in the fury of their unjust hostility to us betray the secret feelings
of their minds and prove the incurable nature of the wound that rankles
in their breasts.

<span id="v.XCVII-p19"></span>3. But you are Christians and the lights
of the senate: accept therefore from me the letter which I append. <span
id="fr_2656"></span>[2657](#fn_2656) This year I send it both in Greek
and Latin that the heretics may not again lyingly assert that I have
made many changes in and additions to the original. I have laboured
hard, I must confess, to preserve the charm of the diction by a like
elegance in my version: and keeping within fixed lines and never
allowing myself to deviate from these I have done my best to maintain
the smooth flow of the writer’s <span id="page_188">p. 188</span> <span
id="v.XCVII-Page_188"></span>eloquence and to render his remarks in the
tone in which they are made. Whether I have succeeded in these two
objects or not I must leave to your judgement to determine. As for the
letter itself you are to know that it is divided into four parts. In the
first Theophilus exhorts believers to celebrate the Lord’s passover; in
the second he slays Apollinarius; in the third he demolishes Origen;
while in the fourth and last he exhorts the heretics to penitence. If
the polemic against Origen should seem to you to be inadequate, you are
to remember that Origenism was fully treated in last year’s
letter; <span id="fr_2657"></span>[2658](#fn_2657) and that this which I
have just translated, as it aims at brevity, was not bound to dwell
farther upon the subject. Besides, its terse and clear confession of
faith directed against Apollinarius is not lacking in dialectical
subtlety. Theophilus first wrests the dagger from his opponent’s hand,
and then stabs him to the heart.

<span id="v.XCVII-p22"></span>4. Entreat the Lord, therefore, that a
composition which has won favour in Greek may not fail to win it also in
Latin, and that what the whole East admires and praises Rome may gladly
take to her heart. And may the chair of the apostle Peter by its
preaching confirm the preaching of the chair of the evangelist Mark.
Popular rumour, indeed, has it that the blessed pope Anastasius is of
like zeal and spirit with Theophilus and that he has pursued the
heretics even to the dens in which they lurk. Moreover his own letters
inform us that he condemns in the West what is already condemned in the
East. May he live for many years <span
id="fr_2658"></span>[2659](#fn_2658) so that the reviving sprouts of
heresy may in course of time by his efforts be made to wither and to
die.
