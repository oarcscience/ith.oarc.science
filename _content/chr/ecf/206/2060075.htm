<p class="c16"><a name="v.LXIV-p2"></A>Fabiola&#146;s visit to Bethlehem had been shortened by the threatened invasion of the Huns which compelled Jerome and his friends to take refuge for a time on the seaboard of Palestine. Fabiola here took leave of her companions and set sail for Italy, but not until Jerome had completed this letter for her use (&sect;22). It contains a mystical account of the vestments of the High Priest worked out with Jerome&#146;s usual ingenuity and learning. Similar treatises are ascribed to Tertullian and to Hosius bishop of Cordova, but these have long since perished. Its date is 396 or 397 <span class="c17"><a name="v.LXIV-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span></p>
