<span id="v.X-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.X-p1.1"></span>Letter X. To Paul, an Old Man of Concordia.</span>

<span id="v.X-p2"></span>Jerome writes to Paul of Concordia, a
centenarian (§2), and the owner of a good theological library (§3), to
lend him some commentaries. In return he sends him his life (newly
written) of Paul the hermit. <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126) The
date of the letter is 374 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.X-p3.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.X-p4"></span>1. The shortness of man’s life is the
punishment for man’s sin; and the fact that even on the very threshold
of the light death constantly overtakes the new-born child proves that
the times are continually sinking into deeper depravity. For when the
first tiller of paradise had been entangled by the serpent in his snaky
coils, and had been forced in consequence to migrate earthwards,
although his deathless state was changed for a mortal one, yet the
sentence <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127) of man’s curse was put
off for nine hundred years, or even more, a period so long that it may
be called a second immortality. Afterwards sin gradually grew more and
more virulent, till the ungodliness of the giants <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128) brought in its train the shipwreck of
the whole world. Then when the world had been cleansed by the baptism—if
I may so call it—of the deluge, human life was contracted to a short
span. Yet even this we have almost altogether wasted, so continually do
our iniquities fight against the divine purposes. For how few there are,
either who go beyond their hundredth year, or who, going beyond it, do
not regret that they have done so; according to that which the Scripture
witnesses in the book of Psalms: “the days of our years are threescore
years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet
is their strength labor and sorrow.” <span
id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129)

<span id="v.X-p8"></span>2. Why, say you, these opening reflections so
remote and so far fetched that one might use against them the Horatian
witticism:

<span id="v.X-p9"></span>Back to the eggs which Leda laid for Zeus,

<span id="v.X-p10"></span>The bard is fain to trace the war of
Troy? <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130)

<span id="v.X-p12"></span>Simply that I may describe in fitting terms
your great age and hoary head as white as Christ’s. <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131) For see, the hundredth circling year
is already passing over you, and yet, always keeping the commandments of
the Lord, amid the circumstances of your present life you think over the
blessedness of that which is to come. Your eyes are bright and keen,
your steps steady, your hearing good, your teeth are white, your voice
musical, your flesh firm and full of sap; your ruddy cheeks belie your
white hairs, your strength is not that of your age. Advancing years have
not, as we too often see them do, impaired the tenacity of your memory;
the coldness of your blood has not blunted an intellect at once warm and
wary. <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132) Your face is not wrinkled
nor your brow furrowed. Lastly, no tremors palsy your hand or cause it
to travel in crooked pathways over the wax on which you write. The Lord
shows us in you the bloom of the resurrection that is to be ours; so
that whereas in others who die by inches whilst yet living, we recognize
the results of sin, in your case we ascribe it <span id="page_12">p.
12</span> <span id="v.X-Page_12"></span>to righteousness that you still
simulate youth at an age to which it is foreign. And although we see the
like haleness of body in many even of those who are sinners, in their
case it is a grant of the devil to lead them into sin, whilst in yours
it is a gift of God to make you rejoice.

<span id="v.X-p15"></span>3. Tully in his brilliant speech on behalf of
Flaccus <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133) describes the learning
of the Greeks as “innate frivolity and accomplished vanity.”

<span id="v.X-p17"></span>Certainly their ablest literary men used to
receive money for pronouncing eulogies upon their kings or princes.
Following their example, I set a price upon my praise. Nor must you
suppose my demand a small one. You are asked to give me the pearl of the
Gospel, <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134) “the words of the Lord,”
“pure words, even as the silver which from the earth is tried, and
purified seven times in the fire,” <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135) I mean the commentaries of
Fortunatian <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136) and—for its account
of the persecutors—the History of Aurelius Victor, <span
id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137) and with these the Letters of
Novatian; <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138) so that, learning the
poison set forth by this schismatic, we may the more gladly drink of the
antidote supplied by the holy martyr Cyprian. In the mean time I have
sent to you, that is to say, to Paul the aged, a Paul that is older
still. <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139) I have taken great pains
to bring my language down to the level of the simpler sort. But, somehow
or other, though you fill it with water, the jar retains the odor which
it acquired when first used. <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140) If
my little gift should please you, I have others also in store which (if
the Holy Spirit shall breathe favorably), shall sail across the sea to
you with all kinds of eastern merchandise.
