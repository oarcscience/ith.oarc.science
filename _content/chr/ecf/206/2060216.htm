<p class="c16"><a name="vii.iv.vi-p2"></A><i>Written for Paula and Eustochium, <span class="c17"><a name="vii.iv.vi-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 387. The Preface is a defence of the genuineness of the Epistle against those who thought its subject beneath the dignity of inspiration. &#8220;There are many degrees of inspiration,&#8221; Jerome says, &#8220;though in Christ alone it is seen in its fulness.&#8221; Many of the other Epistles touch upon small affairs of life, like the cloak left at Troas. To suppose that common life is separate from God is Manich&aelig;anism. Jerome mentions that Marcion, who altered many of the Epistles, did not touch that of Philemon; and brevity in a document which has in it so much of the beauty of the Gospel is a mark of its inspiration.</i></p>
