<span id="v.CXLVI"></span>

<span id="v.CXLVI-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXLVI-p1.1"></span>Letter CXLVI. To Evangelus.</span>

<span id="v.CXLVI-p2"></span>Jerome refutes the opinion of those who
make deacons equal to presbyters, but in doing so himself makes
presbyters equal to bishops.

<span id="v.CXLVI-p3"></span>The date of the letter is unknown.

<span id="v.CXLVI-p4"></span>1. We read in Isaiah the words, “the fool
will speak folly,” <span id="fr_3926"></span>[3927](#fn_3926) and I am
told that some one has been mad enough to put deacons before presbyters,
that is, before bishops. For when the apostle clearly teaches that
presbyters are the same as bishops, must not a mere server of tables and
of widows <span id="fr_3927"></span>[3928](#fn_3927) be insane to set
himself up arrogantly over men through whose prayers the body and blood
of Christ are produced? <span id="fr_3928"></span>[3929](#fn_3928) Do
you ask for proof of what I say? Listen to this passage: “Paul and
Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ
Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops and deacons.” <span
id="fr_3929"></span>[3930](#fn_3929) Do you wish for another instance?
In the Acts of the Apostles Paul thus speaks to the priests <span
id="fr_3930"></span>[3931](#fn_3930) of a single church: “Take heed unto
yourselves and to all the flock, in the which the Holy Ghost hath made
you bishops, to feed the church of God which He purchased with His own
blood.” <span id="fr_3931"></span>[3932](#fn_3931) And lest any should
in a spirit of contention argue that there must then have been more
bishops than one in a single church, there is the following passage
which clearly proves a bishop and a presbyter to be the same. Writing to
Titus the apostle says: “For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou
shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain
presbyters <span id="fr_3932"></span>[3933](#fn_3932) in every city, as
I had appointed thee: if any be blameless, the husband of one wife,
having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. For a bishop
must be blameless as the steward of God.” <span
id="fr_3933"></span>[3934](#fn_3933) And to Timothy he says: “Neglect
not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the
laying on of the hands of the presbytery.” <span
id="fr_3934"></span>[3935](#fn_3934) Peter also says in his first
epistle: “The presbyters which are among you I exhort, who am your
fellow-presbyter and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a
partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: feed the flock of
Christ <span id="fr_3935"></span>[3936](#fn_3935) …taking the oversight
thereof not by constraint but willingly, according unto God.” <span
id="fr_3936"></span>[3937](#fn_3936) In the Greek the meaning is still
plainer, for the word used is <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.CXLVI-p15.2"></span>επισκοποῦντες</span> , that is to say,
overseeing, and this is the origin of the name overseer or bishop. <span
id="fr_3937"></span>[3938](#fn_3937) But perhaps the testimony of these
great men seems to you insufficient. If so, then listen to the blast of
the gospel trumpet, that son of thunder, <span
id="fr_3938"></span>[3939](#fn_3938) the disciple whom Jesus loved <span
id="fr_3939"></span>[3940](#fn_3939) and who reclining on the Saviour’s
breast drank in the waters of sound doctrine. One of his letters begins
thus: “The presbyter unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in
the truth;” <span id="fr_3940"></span>[3941](#fn_3940) and another thus:
“The presbyter unto the well-beloved Gaius whom I love in the
truth.” <span id="fr_3941"></span>[3942](#fn_3941) When subsequently one
presbyter was chosen to preside over the rest, this was done to remedy
schism and to prevent each individual from rending the church of Christ
by drawing it to himself. For even at Alexandria from the time of Mark
the Evangelist until the episcopates of Heraclas and Dionysius the
presbyters always named as bishop one of their own number chosen by
themselves and set in a more exalted position, just as an army elects a
general, or as deacons appoint one of themselves whom they know to be
diligent <span id="page_289">p. 289</span> <span
id="v.CXLVI-Page_289"></span>and call him archdeacon. For what function,
excepting ordination, belongs to a bishop that does not also belong to a
presbyter? It is not the case that there is one church at Rome and
another in all the world beside. Gaul and Britain, Africa and Persia,
India and the East worship one Christ and observe one rule of truth. If
you ask for authority, the world outweighs its capital. <span
id="fr_3942"></span>[3943](#fn_3942) Wherever there is a bishop, whether
it be at Rome or at Engubium, whether it be at Constantinople or at
Rhegium, whether it be at Alexandria or at Zoan, his dignity is one and
his priesthood is one. Neither the command of wealth nor the lowliness
of poverty makes him more a bishop or less a bishop. All alike are
successors of the apostles. <span id="fr_3943"></span>[3944](#fn_3943)

<span id="v.CXLVI-p23"></span>2. But you will say, how comes it then
that at Rome a presbyter is only ordained on the recommendation of a
deacon? To which I reply as follows. Why do you bring forward a custom
which exists in one city only? Why do you oppose to the laws of the
Church a paltry exception which has given rise to arrogance and pride?
The rarer anything is the more it is sought after. In India pennyroyal
is more costly than pepper. Their fewness makes deacons persons of
consequence <span id="fr_3944"></span>[3945](#fn_3944) while presbyters
are less thought of owing to their great numbers. But even in the church
of Rome the deacons stand while the presbyters seat themselves, although
bad habits have by degrees so far crept in that I have seen a deacon, in
the absence of the bishop, seat himself among the presbyters and at
social gatherings give his blessing to them. <span
id="fr_3945"></span>[3946](#fn_3945) Those who act thus must learn that
they are wrong and must give heed to the apostles words: “it is not
reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables.” <span
id="fr_3946"></span>[3947](#fn_3946) They must consider the reasons
which led to the appointment of deacons at the beginning. They must read
the Acts of the Apostles and bear in mind their true position.

<span id="v.CXLVI-p27"></span>Of the names presbyter and bishop the
first denotes age, the second rank. In writing both to Titus and to
Timothy the apostle speaks of the ordination of bishops and of deacons,
but says not a word of the ordination of presbyters; for the fact is
that the word bishops includes presbyters also. Again when a man is
promoted it is from a lower place to a higher. Either then a presbyter
should be ordained a deacon, from the lesser office, that is, to the
more important, to prove that a presbyter is inferior to a deacon; or if
on the other hand it is the deacon that is ordained presbyter, this
latter should recognize that, although he may be less highly paid than a
deacon, he is superior to him in virtue of his priesthood. In fact as if
to tell us that the traditions handed down by the apostles were taken by
them from the old testament, bishops, presbyters and deacons occupy in
the church the same positions as those which were occupied by Aaron, his
sons, and the Levites in the temple. <span
