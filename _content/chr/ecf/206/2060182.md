<span id="vii.ii.ii-p3"></span>Jerome to the most holy Pope Damasus:

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p4"></span>Origen, whilst in his other books he has
surpassed all others, has in the Song of Songs surpassed himself. He
wrote ten volumes upon it, which amount to almost twenty thousand lines,
and in these he discussed, first the version of the Seventy Translators,
then those of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and lastly, a fifth
version which he states that he found on the coast of Atrium, with such
magnificence and fulness, that he appears to me to have realized what is
said in the poem: “The king brought me into his chamber.” I have left
that work on one side, since it would require almost boundless leisure
and labour and money to translate so great a work into Latin, even if it
could be worthily done; and I have translated these two short treatises,
which he composed in the form of daily lectures for those who were still
like babes and sucklings, and I have studied faithfulness rather than
elegance. You can conceive how great a value the larger work possesses,
when the smaller gives you such satisfaction.
