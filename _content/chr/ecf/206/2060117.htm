<p class="c16"><a name="v.CVI-p2"></A>A long letter in which Jerome answers a number of questions put to him by two sojourners in Getica, Sunnias and Fretela. Diligent students of scripture, these men were at a loss to understand the frequent differences between Jerome&#146;s Latin psalter of 383 <span class="c17"><a name="v.CVI-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> (the so-called Roman psalter) and the LXX, and accordingly sent him a long list of passages with a request for explanation. Jerome in his reply deals fully with all these and points out to his correspondents that they have been misled by their edition of the LXX. (the &#8220;common&#8221; edition) which differs widely from the critical text of Origen as given in the Hexapla and used by himself. He also expresses his joy to find that even among the Get&aelig; the scriptures are now diligently studied. The date of the letter is about 403 <span class="c17"><a name="v.CVI-p2.2"></A>a.d.</span></p>
