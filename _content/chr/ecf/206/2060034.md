<span id="v.XXIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XXIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XXIII. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XXIII-p2"></span>Jerome writes to Marcella to console her
for the loss of a friend who, like herself, was the head of a religious
society at Rome. The news of Lea’s death had first reached Marcella when
she was engaged with Jerome in the study of the 73d psalm. Later in the
day he writes this letter in which, after extolling Lea, he contrasts
her end with that of the consul-elect, Vettius Agorius Prætextatus, a
man of great ability and integrity, whom he declares to be now “in
Tartarus.” Written at Rome in 384 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XXIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.XXIII-p3"></span>1. To-day, about the third hour, just as I
was beginning to read with you the seventy-second psalm <span
id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677) —the first, that is, of the third
book—and to explain that its title belonged partly to the second book
and partly to the third—the previous book, I mean, concluding with the
words “the prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended,” <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678) and the next commencing with the words
“a psalm of Asaph” <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679) —and just as
I had come on the passage in which the righteous man declares: “If I
say, I will speak thus; behold I should offend against the generation of
thy children,” <span id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680) a verse which is
differently rendered in our Latin version: <span
id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681) —suddenly the news came that our most
saintly friend Lea had departed from the body. As was only natural, you
turned deadly pale; for there are few persons, if any, who do not burst
into tears when the earthen vessel breaks. <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682) But if you wept it was not from doubt
as to her future lot, but only because you had not rendered to her the
last sad offices which are due to the dead. Finally, as we were still
conversing together, a second message informed us that her remains had
been already conveyed to Ostia.

<span id="v.XXIII-p10"></span>2. You may ask what is the use of
repeating all this. I will reply in the apostle’s words, “much every
way.” <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683) First, it shows that all
must hail with joy the release of a soul which has trampled Satan under
foot, and won for itself, at last, a crown of <span id="page_42">p.
42</span> <span id="v.XXIII-Page_42"></span>tranquillity. Secondly, it
gives me an opportunity of briefly describing her life. Thirdly, it
enables me to assure you that the consul-elect, <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684) that detractor of his age, <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685) is now in Tartarus. <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686)

<span id="v.XXIII-p15"></span>Who can sufficiently eulogize our dear
Lea’s mode of living? So complete was her conversion to the Lord that,
becoming the head of a monastery, she showed herself a true mother <span
id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687) to the virgins in it, wore coarse
sackcloth instead of soft raiment, passed sleepless nights in prayer,
and instructed her companions even more by example than by precept. So
great was her humility that she, who had once been the mistress of many,
was accounted the servant of all; and certainly, the less she was
reckoned an earthly mistress the more she became a servant of Christ.
She was careless of her dress, neglected her hair, and ate only the
coarsest food. Still, in all that she did, she avoided ostentation that
she might not have her reward in this world. <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688)

<span id="v.XXIII-p18"></span>3. Now, therefore, in return for her short
toil, Lea enjoys everlasting felicity; she is welcomed into the choirs
of the angels; she is comforted in Abraham’s bosom. And, as once the
beggar Lazarus saw the rich man, for all his purple, lying in torment,
so does Lea see the consul, not now in his triumphal robe but clothed in
mourning, and asking for a drop of water from her little finger. <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689) How great a change have we here! A few
days ago the highest dignitaries of the city walked before him as he
ascended the ramparts of the capitol like a general celebrating a
triumph; the Roman people leapt up to welcome and applaud him, and at
the news of his death the whole city was moved. Now he is desolate and
naked, a prisoner in the foulest darkness, and not, as his unhappy
wife <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690) falsely asserts, set in the
royal abode of the milky way. <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691) On
the other hand Lea, who was always shut up in her one closet, who seemed
poor and of little worth, and whose life was accounted madness, <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692) now follows Christ and sings, “Like as
we have heard, so have we seen in the city of our God.” <span
id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693)

<span id="v.XXIII-p24"></span>4. And now for the moral of all this,
which, with tears and groans, I conjure you to remember. While we run
the way of this world, we must not clothe ourselves with two coats, that
is, with a twofold faith, or burthen ourselves with leathern shoes, that
is, with dead works; we must not allow scrips filled with money to weigh
us down, or lean upon the staff of worldly power. <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694) We must not seek to possess both
Christ and the world. No; things eternal must take the place of things
transitory; <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695) and since,
physically speaking, we daily anticipate death, if we wish for
immortality we must realize that we are but mortal.
