<span id="v.LXXXVIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.LXXXVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXXVIII. To Theophilus.</span>

<span id="v.LXXXVIII-p2"></span>Replying to the preceding letter Jerome
again congratulates Theophilus on the success of his efforts to put down
Origenism, and informs him that they have already borne fruit as far
west as Italy. He then asks him for the decrees of his council (held
recently at Alexandria). The date of the letter is 400 <span
class="c17"><span id="v.LXXXVIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>

<span id="v.LXXXVIII-p3"></span>Jerome to the most blessed pope
Theophilus. The letter of your holiness has given me a twofold pleasure,
partly because it has had for its bearers those reverend and estimable
men, the bishop Agatho and the deacon Athanasius, and partly because it
has shewn your zeal for the faith against a most wicked heresy. The
voice of your holiness has rung throughout the world, and to the joy of
all Christ’s churches the poisonous suggestions of the devil have been
silenced. The old serpent <span id="fr_2620"></span>[2621](#fn_2620)
hisses no longer, but, writhing and disembowelled, lurks in dark caverns
unable to bear the shining of the sun. I have already, before the
writing of your letter, sent missives to the West pointing out to those
of my own language some of the quibbles employed by the heretics. I hold
it due to the special providence of God that you should have written to
the pope Anastasius <span id="fr_2621"></span>[2622](#fn_2621) at the
same time as myself, and should thus without knowing it have been the
means of confirming my testimony. Now that you have directly urged me to
do so, I shall shew myself more zealous than ever to recall from their
error simple souls both near and far. Nor shall I hesitate, if needful,
to incur odium with some, for we ought to please God rather than
men: <span id="fr_2622"></span>[2623](#fn_2622) although indeed they
have been much more forward to defend their heresy than I and others
have been to attack it. At the same time I beg that if you have any
synodical decrees bearing upon the subject you will forward them to me,
that, strengthened with the authority of so great a prelate, I may open
my mouth for Christ with more freedom and confidence. The presbyter
Vincent has arrived from Rome two days ago and humbly salutes you. He
tells me again and again that Rome and almost the whole of Italy owe
their deliverance after Christ to your letters. Shew diligence
therefore, most loving and most blessed pope, and whenever opportunity
offers write to the bishops of the West not to hesitate—in your own
words <span id="fr_2623"></span>[2624](#fn_2623) —to cut down with a
sharp sickle the sprouts of evil.
