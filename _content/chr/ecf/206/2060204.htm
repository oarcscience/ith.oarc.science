<p class="c16"><a name="vii.iii.xv-p2"></A><i>There are three stages of Jerome&#146;s work of Scripture Translation. The first is during his stay at Rome, <span class="c17"><a name="vii.iii.xv-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span> 382&#8211;385, when he translated only from the Greek&#8212;the New Testament from the Greek <span class="c17"><a name="vii.iii.xv-p2.2"></A>mss.</span>, and the Book of Psalms from the LXX. The second is the period immediately after his settlement at Bethlehem, when he translated still from the LXX., but marked with obeli and asterisks the passages in which that version differed from the Hebrew: the third from <span class="c17"><a name="vii.iii.xv-p2.3"></A>a.d.</span> 390&#8211;404, in which he translated directly from the Hebrew. The work of the second period is that which is now before us. The whole of the Old Testament was translated from the LXX. (see his Apology, book ii. c. 24), but most of it was lost during his lifetime (see Letters CXXXIV. (end) and CXVI. 34 (in Augustin Letter, 62)). What remains is the Book of Job, the Psalms, Chronicles, the Books of Solomon, and Tobit and Judith.</i></p>
