<p class="c30"><a name="v.XXXVI-p1"></A>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.XXXVI-p1.1"></A>Letter XXXVI. To Pope Damasus.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.XXXVI-p2"></A>Jerome&#146;s reply to the foregoing. For the second and fourth questions he refers Damasus to the writings of Tertullian, Novatian, and Origen. The remaining three he deals with in detail.</p>  
<p><a name="v.XXXVI-p3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#015">Gen. iv. 15</a><a name="v.XXXVI-p3.1"></A>, he understands to mean &#8220;the slayer of Cain shall complete the sevenfold vengeance which is to be wreaked upon him.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="v.XXXVI-p4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#018">Exodus xiii. 18</a><a name="v.XXXVI-p4.1"></A>, he proposes to reconcile with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016">Gen. xv. 16</a><a name="v.XXXVI-p4.2"></A>, by supposing that in the one place the tribe of Levi is referred to, in the other the tribe of Judah. He suggests, however, that the words rendered by the LXX. &#8220;in the fifth generation&#8221; more probably mean &#8220;harnessed&#8221; (so A.V.) or &#8220;laden.&#8221; In reply to the question about Isaac he says: &#8220;No man save Him who for our salvation has deigned to put on flesh has full knowledge and a complete grasp of the truth. Paul, Samuel, David, Elisha, all make mistakes, and holy men only know what God reveals to them.&#8221; He then goes on to give a mystical interpretation of the passage suggested by the martyr Hippolytus. Written the day after the previous letter.</p>
