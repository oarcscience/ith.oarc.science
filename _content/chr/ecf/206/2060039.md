<span id="v.XXVIII-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.XXVIII-p1.1"></span>Letter XXVIII. To Marcella.</span>

<span id="v.XXVIII-p2"></span>An explanation of the Hebrew word Selah.
This word, rendered by the LXX. <span class="Greek"><span
id="v.XXVIII-p2.1"></span>διάψαλμα</span> and by Aquila <span
class="Greek"><span id="v.XXVIII-p2.2"></span>ἀ</span><span
class="Greek"><span id="v.XXVIII-p2.3"></span>εί</span>, was as much a
crux in Jerome’s day as it is in ours. “Some,” he writes, “make it a
‘change of metre,’ others ‘a pause for breath,’ others ‘the beginning of
a new subject.’ According to yet others it has something to do with
rhythm or marks a burst of instrumental music.” Jerome himself inclines
to follow Aquila and Origen, who make the word mean “forever,” and
suggests that it betokens completion, like the “explicit” or “feliciter”
in contemporary Latin <span class="c17"><span
id="v.XXVIII-p2.4"></span>mss.</span> Written at Rome <span
class="c17"><span id="v.XXVIII-p2.5"></span>a.d.</span> 384.
