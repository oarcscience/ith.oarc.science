<p class="c30"><a name="v.LXXXIX-p1"></A>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.LXXXIX-p1.1"></A>Letter LXXXIX. From Theophilus to Jerome.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.LXXXIX-p2"></A>This letter (probably earlier in date than the three preceding) commends to Jerome the monk Theodore, who, having come from Rome to declare the condemnation of Origenism by the church there, had visited the monasteries of Nitria now purged of heresy, and wished before returning to the West to see the Holy Places as well. The date of the letter is 400 <span class="c17"><a name="v.LXXXIX-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.LXXXIX-p3"></A>Theophilus, bishop, to the well-beloved lord and most loving brother the presbyter Jerome. I have learned the project of the monk Theodore&#8212;which will be known also to your holiness&#8212;and I approve of it. Having to leave us on a voyage for Rome, he has been unwilling to set out without first visiting and embracing as his own flesh and <A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A> <a name="v.LXXXIX-Page_184"></A>blood you and the reverend brothers who are with you in the monastery. You will, I am sure, rejoice in the news with which he will meet your welcome, that quiet has been restored to the church here. He has seen all the monasteries of Nitria and can tell you of the continence and meekness of the monks in them; as also how the Origenists have been put down and scattered, how peace has been restored to the church, and how the discipline of the Lord is being upheld. How gladly would I see the mask of hypocrisy laid aside by those also who near you are said to be undermining the truth. I feel obliged to write thus because the brothers in your neighbourhood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2624"></A><A HREF="#fn_2624"><FONT SIZE="1">2625</FONT></A>
 are mistaken concerning them. Wherefore take heed to yourselves and shun men of this type; even as it is written:&#8212;&#8220;if any man bring not to you the faith of the church, bid him not God speed.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2625"></A><A HREF="#fn_2625"><FONT SIZE="1">2626</FONT></A>
 It may, indeed, be superfluous to write thus to you who can recall the erring from their error, yet no harm is done when those careful for the faith admonish even the wise and learned. Kindly salute in my name all the brothers who are with you.</p>
