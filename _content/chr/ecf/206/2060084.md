id="v.LXXIII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXIII. To Evangelus.</span>

<span id="v.LXXIII-p2"></span>Evangelus had sent Jerome an anonymous
treatise in which Melchisedek was identified with the Holy Ghost, and
had asked him what he thought of the theory. Jerome in his reply
repudiates the idea as absurd and insists that Melchisedek was a real
man, possibly, as the Jews said, Shem the eldest son of Noah. The date
of the letter is 398 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXXIII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>
