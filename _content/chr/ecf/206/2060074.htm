<p class="c30"><a name="v.LXIII-p1"></A>  <span class="c1"><a name="v.LXIII-p1.1"></A>Letter LXIII. To Theophilus.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.LXIII-p2"></A>When the dispute arose between Jerome and Epiphanius on the one side and Rufinus and John of Jerusalem on the other (see Letter LI.), Theophilus bishop of Alexandria, being appealed to by the latter sent the presbyter Isidore to report to him on the matter. Isidore reported against Jerome and consequently Theophilus refused to answer several of his letters. Finally he wrote counselling him to obey the canons of the church. Jerome replies that to do this has always been his first object. He then remonstrates with Theophilus on his too great leniency towards the Origenists and declares it to be productive of the worst results. The date of the letter is probably 397 <span class="c17"><a name="v.LXIII-p2.1"></A>a.d.</span></p>  
<p class="c16"><a name="v.LXIII-p3"></A>Jerome to the most blessed pope&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1911"></A><A HREF="#fn_1911"><FONT SIZE="1">1912</FONT></A>
 Theophilus.</p>  
<p><a name="v.LXIII-p5"></A>1. Your holiness will remember that at the time when you kept silence towards me, I never ceased to do my duty by writing to you, not taking so much into account what you in the exercise of your discretion were then doing as what it became me to do. And now that I have received a letter from your grace, I see that my reading of the gospel has not been without fruit. For if the frequent prayers of a woman changed the determination of an unyielding judge,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1912"></A><A HREF="#fn_1912"><FONT SIZE="1">1913</FONT></A>
 how much more must my constant appeals have softened a fatherly heart like yours?</p>  
<p><a name="v.LXIII-p7"></A>2. I thank you for your reminder concerning the canons of the Church. Truly, &#8220;whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1913"></A><A HREF="#fn_1913"><FONT SIZE="1">1914</FONT></A>
 Still I would assure you that nothing is more my aim than to maintain the rights of Christ, to keep to the lines laid down by the fathers, and always to remember the faith of Rome; that faith which is praised by the lips of an apostle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1914"></A><A HREF="#fn_1914"><FONT SIZE="1">1915</FONT></A>
 and of which the Alexandrian church boasts to be a sharer.</p>  
<p><a name="v.LXIII-p10"></A>3. Many religious persons are displeased that you are so long-suffering in regard to that shocking heresy,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1915"></A><A HREF="#fn_1915"><FONT SIZE="1">1916</FONT></A>
 and that you suppose yourself able by such lenity to amend those who are attacking the Church&#146;s vitals. They believe that, while you are waiting for the penitence of a few, your action is fostering the boldness of abandoned men and making their party stronger. Farewell in Christ.</p>
