<span id="v.CXLV-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.CXLV-p1.1"></span>Letter CXLV. To Exuperantius.</span>

<span id="v.CXLV-p2"></span>Jerome advises Exuperantius, a Roman
soldier, to come to Bethlehem and with his brother Quintilian to become
a monk. According to Palladius (H. L. c. lxxx.) Exuperantius came to
Jerome but went away again ‘unable to endure his violence and ill-will.’
The date of the letter is unknown.

<span id="v.CXLV-p3"></span>Among all the favours that my friendship
with the reverend brother Quintilian has conferred upon me the greatest
is this that he has introduced me in the spirit to you whom I do not
know personally. Who can fail to love a man who, while he wears the
cloak and uniform of a soldier does the work of a prophet, and while his
outer man gives promise of quite a different character, overcomes this
by the inner man which is formed after the image of the creator. I come
forward therefore to challenge you to an interchange of letters and beg
that you will often give me occasion to reply to you that I may for the
future feel less constraint in writing.

<span id="v.CXLV-p4"></span>For the present I will content myself by
suggesting to your discretion that you should bear in mind the apostle’s
words: “Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou
loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife;” <span
id="fr_3916"></span>[3917](#fn_3916) that is, seek not that binding
which is contrary to loosing. He who has contracted the obligations of
marriage, is bound, and he who is bound is a slave; on the other hand he
who is loosed is free. Since therefore you rejoice in the freedom of
Christ, since your life is better than your profession, since you are
all but on the housetop of which the Saviour speaks; you ought not to
come down to take your clothes, <span
id="fr_3917"></span>[3918](#fn_3917) you ought not to look behind you,
you ought not having put your hand to the plough, then to let it
go. <span id="fr_3918"></span>[3919](#fn_3918) Rather, if you can,
imitate Joseph and leave your garment in the hand of your Egyptian
mistress, <span id="fr_3919"></span>[3920](#fn_3919) that naked you may
follow your Lord and Saviour. For in the gospel He says: “Whosoever doth
not leave all that he hath and bear his cross and come after me cannot
be my disciple.” <span id="fr_3920"></span>[3921](#fn_3920) Cast from
you the burthen of the things of this world, and seek not those riches
which in the gospel are compared to the <span id="page_288">p.
288</span> <span id="v.CXLV-Page_288"></span>humps <span
id="fr_3921"></span>[3922](#fn_3921) of camels. Naked and unencumbered
fly up to heaven; masses of gold will but impede the wings of your
virtue. I do not speak thus because I know you to be covetous, but
because I have a notion that your object in remaining so long in the
army is to fill that purse which the Lord has commanded you to empty.
For they who have possessions and riches are bidden to sell all that
they have and to give to the poor and then to follow the Saviour. <span
id="fr_3922"></span>[3923](#fn_3922) Thus if your worship is rich
already you ought to fulfil the command and sell your riches; or if you
are still poor you ought not to amass what you will have to pay away.
Christ accepts the sacrifices made for him <span
id="fr_3923"></span>[3924](#fn_3923) according as he who makes them has
a willing mind. Never were any men poorer than the apostles; yet never
any left more for the Lord than they. The poor widow in the gospel who
cast but two mites into the treasury was set before all the men of
wealth because she gave all that she had. <span
id="fr_3924"></span>[3925](#fn_3924) So it should be with you. Seek not
for wealth which you will have to pay away; but rather give up that
which you have already acquired that Christ may know his new recruit to
be brave and resolute, and then when you are a great way off His Father
will run with joy to meet you. He will give you a robe, will put a ring
upon your finger, and will kill for you the fatted calf. <span
id="fr_3925"></span>[3926](#fn_3925) Then when you are freed from all
encumbrances God will soon make a way for you to cross the sea to me
with your reverend brother Quintilian. I have now knocked at the door of
friendship: if you open it to me you will find me a frequent visitor.
