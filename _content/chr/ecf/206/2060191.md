<span id="vii.iii.ii-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="vii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>Preface to Genesis.</span>

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p2"></span>*This Preface was addressed to
Desiderius, but which of the three correspondents of Jerome who bore
this name is uncertain (See Article Desiderius in Smith and Wace’s
“Dictionary of Christian Biography”). We do not give it because it has
been given at length as a specimen of the rest, in Jerome’s “Apology,”
book ii., vol. iii. of this series, pp. 515–516. Jerome in it complains
that he is accused of forging a new version. He justifies his
undertaking by showing that in the versions then current many passages
were left out (though they exist in our* <span id="page_489">p.
489</span> <span id="vii.iii.ii-Page_489"></span>*copies of the LXX.),
such as “Out of Egypt” ([Hos. xi.
1](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#001)<span id="vii.iii.ii-p2.1"></span>);
“They shall look on him whom they pierced” ([Zech. xii.
10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)<span id="vii.iii.ii-p2.2"></span>),
etc., which are quoted in the New Testament and are found in the Hebrew.
He accounts for these omissions by the suggestion that the LXX. were
afraid of offending Ptolemy Lagus for whom they worked, and who was a
Platonist. He rejects the fable of the LXX. being shut up in separate
cells and producing an identical version, and protests against the
notion that they were inspired, and he urges his calumniators, by
applying to those who knew Hebrew, to test the correctness of his
version.*

<span id="vii.iii.ii-p3"></span>*There is no Preface to the other books
of the Pentateuch. From the allusion to the work on the Pentateuch as
lately finished, in the Preface to Joshua, which was published in 404,
it is presumed that the date of the translation of the Pentateuch is
403.*
