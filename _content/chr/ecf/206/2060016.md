<span id="v.V"></span>

<span id="v.V-p1"></span> <span class="c1"><span
id="v.V-p1.1"></span>Letter V. To Florentius.</span>

<span id="v.V-p2"></span>Written a few months after the preceding (about
the end of 374 <span class="c17"><span id="v.V-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>)
from the Syrian Desert. After dilating on his friendship for Florentius,
and making a passing allusion to Rufinus, Jerome mentions certain books,
copies of which he desires to be sent to him. He also speaks of a
runaway slave about whom Florentius had written to him.

<span id="v.V-p3"></span>1. Your letter, dear friend, finds me dwelling
in that quarter of the desert which is nearest to Syria and the
Saracens. And the reading of it rekindles in my mind so keen a desire to
set out for Jerusalem that I am almost ready to violate my monastic vow
in order to gratify my affection. Wishing to do the best I can, as I
cannot come in person I send you a letter instead; and thus, though
absent in the body, I come to you in love and in spirit. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74) For my earnest prayer is that our infant
friendship, firmly cemented as it is in Christ, may never be rent
asunder by time or distance. We ought rather to strengthen the bond by
an interchange of letters. Let these pass between us, meet each other on
the way, and converse with us. Affection will not lose much if it keeps
up an intercourse of this kind.

<span id="v.V-p5"></span>2. You write that our brother, Rufinus, has not
yet come to you. Even if he does come it will do little to satisfy my
longing, for I shall not now be able to see him. He is too far away to
come hither, and the conditions of the lonely life that I have adopted
forbid me to go to him. For I am no longer free to follow my own wishes.
I entreat you, therefore, to ask him to allow you to have the
commentaries of the reverend Rhetitius, <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75) bishop of Augustodunum, <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76) copied, in which he has so eloquently
explained the Song of Songs. A countryman of the aforesaid brother
Rufinus, the old man Paul, <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77) writes
that Rufinus has his copy of Tertullian, and urgently requests that this
may be returned. Next I have to ask you to get written on paper by a
copyist certain books which the subjoined list <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78) will show you that I do not possess. I
beg also that you will send me the explanation of the Psalms of David,
and the copious work on Synods of the reverend Hilary, <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79) which I copied for him <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80) at Trêves with my own hand. Such books,
you know, must be the food of the Christian soul if it is to meditate in
the law of the Lord day and night. <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81)

<span id="v.V-p13"></span>Others you welcome beneath your roof, you
cherish and comfort, you help out of your own purse; but so far as I am
concerned, you have given me everything when once you have granted my
request. And since, through the Lord’s bounty, I am rich in volumes of
the sacred library, <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82) you may command
me in turn. I will send you what you please; and do not suppose that an
order from you will give me trouble. I have pupils devoted to the art of
copying. Nor do I merely promise a favor because I am asking one. Our
brother, Heliodorus, <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83) tells me that
there are many parts of the Scriptures which you seek and cannot find.
But even if you have them all, affection is sure to assert its rights
and to seek for itself more than it already has.

<span id="v.V-p16"></span>3. As regards the present master of your
slave—of whom you have done me the honor to write—I have no doubt but
that he is his kidnapper. While I was still at Antioch the presbyter,
Evagrius, often reproved him in my presence. To whom he made this
answer: “I have nothing to fear.” He declares that his master has
dismissed him. If you both want him, he is here; send <span
id="page_8">p. 8</span> <span id="v.V-Page_8"></span>him whither you
will. I think I am not wrong in refusing to allow a runaway to stray
farther. Here in the wilderness I cannot myself execute your orders; and
therefore I have asked my dear friend Evagrius to push the affair
vigorously, both for your sake and for mine. I desire your welfare in
Christ.
