id="v.LXXII-p1.1"></span>Letter LXXII. To Vitalis.</span>

<span id="v.LXXII-p2"></span>Vitalis had asked Jerome “Is Scripture
credible when it tells us that Solomon and Ahaz became fathers at the
age of eleven?” The difficulty had previously occurred to Jerome himself
(Letter XXXVI. 10, whence perhaps Vitalis took it) and in this letter he
suggests several ways in which it may be met. He is quite prepared, if
necessary, to accept the alleged fact on the grounds that “there are
many things in Scripture which sound incredible and yet are true” and
that “nature cannot resist the Lord of nature” (§2). He is disposed,
however, to regard the question as trivial and of no importance. The
date of the letter is 398 <span class="c17"><span
id="v.LXXII-p2.1"></span>a.d.</span>
