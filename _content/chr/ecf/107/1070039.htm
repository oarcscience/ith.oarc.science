<p class="c13"><a name="iii.xxxvii-p2"></A><a name="iii.xxxvii-p2.1"></A><span class="c10"><a name="iii.xxxvii-p2.2"></A>Chapter VIII. 15&#8211;18</span></p>  
<p class="c31"><a name="iii.xxxvii-p3"></A>1. <span class="c10"><a name="iii.xxxvii-p3.1"></A>In</span> the four Gospels, or rather in the four books of the one Gospel, Saint John the apostle, not undeservedly in respect of his spiritual understanding compared to the eagle, has elevated his preaching higher and far more sublimely than the other three; and in this elevating of it he would have our hearts likewise lifted up. For the other three evangelists walked with the Lord on earth as with a man; concerning His divinity they have said but little; but this evangelist, as if he disdained to walk on earth, just as in the very opening of his discourse he thundered on us, soared not only above the earth and above the whole compass of air and sky, but even above the whole army of angels and the whole order of invisible powers, and reached to Him by whom all things were made; saying, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. This was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.&#8221; To this so great sublimity of his beginning all the rest of his preaching well agrees; and he has spoken concerning the divinity of the Lord as none other has spoken. What he had drank in, the same he gave forth. For it is not without reason that it is recorded of him in this very Gospel, that at supper he reclined on the Lord&#146;s bosom. From that breast then he drank in secret; but what he drank in secret he gave forth openly, that there may come to all nations not only the incarnation of the Son of God, and His passion and resurrection, but also what He was before His incarnation, the only Son of the Father, the Word of the Father, coeternal with Him that begat, equal with Him by whom He was sent; but yet in that very sending made less, that the Father might be greater.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p4"></A>2. Whatever, then, you have heard stated in lowly manner concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, think of that economy by which He assumed flesh; but whatever you hear, or read, stated in the Gospel concerning Him that is sublime and high above all creatures, and divine, and equal and coeternal with the Father, be sure that this which you read appertains to the form of God, not to the form of the servant. For if you hold this rule, you who can understand it (inasmuch as you are not all able to understand it, but you are all bound to trust it),&#8212;if, I say, you hold this rule, as men walking in the light, you will fight against the calumnies of heretical darkness without fear. For there have not been wanting those who, in reading the Gospel, followed only those testimonies that concern the humility of Christ, and have been deaf to those which have declared His divinity; deaf for this reason, that they may be full of evil words. There have likewise been some, who, giving heed only to those which speak of the excellency of the Lord, even though they have read of His mercy in becoming man for our sakes, have not believed the testimonies, but accounted them false and invented by men; contending that our Lord Jesus Christ was only God, not also man. Some in this way, some in that: both in error. But the catholic faith, holding from both the truths which each holds and preaching the truth which each believes, has both understood that Christ is God and also believed Him to be man: for each is written and each is true. Shouldst thou assert that Christ is only God, thou deniest the medicine whereby thou wast healed: shouldst thou assert that Christ is only man, thou deniest the power whereby thou wast created. Hold therefore both. O faithful soul and catholic heart, hold both, believe both, faithfully confess both. Christ is both God and also man. How is Christ God? Equal with the Father, one with the Father. How is Christ man? Born of a virgin, taking upon Himself mortality from man, but not taking iniquity.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p5"></A>3. These Jews then saw the man; they neither perceived nor believed Him to be God: and you have already heard how, among all the rest, they said to Him, &#8220;Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.&#8221; You have also heard what He said in reply, as it was read to you yesterday, and according to our ability discussed. To-day have been read these words of His, &#8220;Ye judge after the flesh.&#8221; Therefore it is, saith He, that you say to me, &#8220;Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true,&#8221; because you judge after the flesh, because you perceive not God; the man you see, and by persecuting the man, you offend God hidden in Him. &#8220;Ye,&#8221; then, &#8220;judge after the flesh.&#8221; Because I bear witness of myself, I therefore appear to you arrogant. For every   <A NAME="page_209"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 209</FONT></A> <a name="iii.xxxvii-Page_209"></A>man, when he wishes to bear commendatory witness of himself, seems arrogant and proud. Hence it is written, &#8220;Let not thy own mouth praise thee, but let thy neighbor&#146;s&#8221; mouth praise thee.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_664"></A><A HREF="#fn_664"><FONT SIZE="1">665</FONT></A>
 But this was said to man. For we are weak, and we speak to the weak. We can speak the truth, but we can also lie; although we are bound to speak the truth, still we have it in our power to lie when we will. But far be it from us to think that the darkness of falsehood could be found in the splendor of the divine light. He spoke as the light, spoke as the truth; but the light was shining in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not: therefore they judged after the flesh. &#8220;Ye,&#8221; saith He, &#8220;judge after the flesh.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p7"></A>4. &#8220;I judge not any man.&#8221; Does not the Lord Jesus Christ, then, judge any man? Is He not the same of whom we confess that He rose again on the third day, ascended into heaven, there sits at the right hand of the Father, and thence shall come to judge the quick and the dead? Is not this our faith of which the apostle says, &#8220;With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation?&#8221; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_665"></A><A HREF="#fn_665"><FONT SIZE="1">666</FONT></A>
 When, therefore, we confess these things, do we contradict the Lord? We say that He shall come a judge of the quick and the dead, whilst He says Himself, &#8220;I judge not any man.&#8221; This question may be solved in two ways: Either that we may understand this expression, &#8220;I judge not any man,&#8221; to mean, I judge not any man <i>now</i>; in accordance with what He says in another place, &#8220;I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world;&#8221; not denying His judgment here, but deferring it. Or, otherwise, surely that when He said, &#8220;Ye judge after the flesh,&#8221; He subjoined, &#8220;I judge not any man,&#8221; in such manner that thou shouldst understand &#8220;after the flesh&#8221; to complete the sense. Therefore let no scruple of doubt remain in our heart against the faith which we hold and declare concerning Christ as judge. Christ is come, but first to save, then to judge: to adjudge to punishment those who would not be saved; to bring them to life who, by believing, did not reject salvation. Accordingly, the first dispensation of our Lord Jesus Christ is medicinal, not judicial; for if He had come to judge first, He would have found none on whom He might bestow the rewards of righteousness. Because, therefore, He saw that all were sinners, and that none was exempt from the death of sin, His mercy had first to be craved, and afterwards His judgment must be executed; for of Him the psalm had sung, &#8220;Mercy and judgment will I sing to Thee, O Lord.&#8221;  &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_666"></A><A HREF="#fn_666"><FONT SIZE="1">667</FONT></A>
 Now, He says not &#8220;judgment and mercy,&#8221; for if judgment had been first, there would be no mercy; but it is mercy first, then judgment. What is the mercy first? The Creator of man deigned to become man; was made what He had made, that the creature He had made might not perish. What can be added to this mercy? And yet He has added thereto. It was not enough for Him to be made man, He added to this that He was rejected of men; it was not enough to be rejected, He was dishonored; it was not enough to be dishonored, He was put to death; but even this was not enough, it was by the death of the cross. For when the apostle was commending to us His obedience even unto death, it was not enough for him to say, &#8220;He became obedient unto death;&#8221; for it was not unto death of any kind whatever: but he added, &#8220;even the death of the cross.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_667"></A><A HREF="#fn_667"><FONT SIZE="1">668</FONT></A>
 Among all kinds of death, there was nothing worse than that death. In short, that wherein one is racked by the most intense pains is called <i>cruciatus</i>, which takes its name from <i>crux</i>, a cross. For the crucified, hanging on the tree, nailed to the wood, were killed by a slow lingering death. To be crucified was not merely to be put to death; for the victim lived long on the cross, not because longer life was chosen, but because death itself was stretched out that the pain might not be too quickly ended. He willed to die for us, yet it is not enough to say this; He deigned to be crucified, became obedient even to the death of the cross. He who was about to take away all death, chose the lowest and worst kind of death: He slew death by the worst of deaths. To the Jews who understood not, it was indeed the worst of deaths, but it was chosen by the Lord. For He was to have that very cross as His sign; that very cross, a trophy, as it were, over the vanquished devil, He was to put on the brow of believers, so that the apostle said, &#8220;God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_668"></A><A HREF="#fn_668"><FONT SIZE="1">669</FONT></A>
 Nothing was then more intolerable in the flesh, nothing is now more glorious on the brow. What does He reserve for His faithful one, when He has put such honor on the instrument of His own torture? Now is the cross no longer used among the Romans in the punishment of criminals, for where the cross of the Lord came to be honored, it was thought that even a guilty man would be   <A NAME="page_210"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 210</FONT></A> <a name="iii.xxxvii-Page_210"></A>honored if he should be crucified. Hence, He who came for this cause judged no man: He suffered also the wicked. He suffered unjust judgment, that He might execute righteous judgment. But it was of His mercy that He endured unjust judgment. In short, He became so low as to come to the cross; yea, laid aside His power, but published His mercy. Wherein did He lay aside His power? In that He would not come down from the cross, though He had the power to rise again from the sepulchre. Wherein did He publish His mercy? In that, when hanging on the cross, He said, &#8220;Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_669"></A><A HREF="#fn_669"><FONT SIZE="1">670</FONT></A>
 Whether, then, it be that He said, &#8220;I judge not any man,&#8221; because He had come not to judge the world, but to save the world; or, that, as I have mentioned, when He had said, &#8220;Ye judge after the flesh,&#8221; He added, &#8220;I judge not any man,&#8221; for us to understand that Christ judgeth not after the flesh, like as He was judged by men.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p13"></A>5. But that you may know that Christ is judge even now, hear what follows: &#8220;And if I judge, my judgment is true.&#8221; Behold, thou hast Him as thy judge, but acknowledge Him as thy Saviour, lest thou feel the judge. But why has He said that His judgment is true? &#8220;Because,&#8221; saith He, &#8220;I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.&#8221; I have said to you, brethren, that this holy Evangelist John soars exceedingly high: it is with difficulty that he is comprehended. But we need to remind you, beloved, of the deeper mystery of this soaring. Both in the prophet Ezekiel, and in the Apocalypse of this very John whose Gospel this is, there is mentioned a fourfold living creature, having four characteristic faces; that of a man, of an ox, of a lion, and of an eagle. Those who have handled the mysteries of Holy Scripture before us have, for the most part, understood by this living creature, or rather, these four living creatures, the four evangelists. They have understood the lion as put for king, because he appears to be, in a manner, the king of beasts on account of his strength and terrible valor. This character is assigned to Matthew, because in the generations of the Lord he followed the royal line, showing how the Lord was, along the royal line, of the seed of David. But Luke, because he begins with the priesthood of Zacharias, mentioning the father of John the Baptist, is designated the ox; for the ox was an important victim in the sacrifice of the priests. To Mark is deservedly assigned the man Christ, because neither has he said anything of the royal authority, nor did he begin with the priestly function, but only set out with the man Christ. All these have departed but little from the things of earth, that is, from those things which our Lord Jesus Christ performed on earth; of His divinity they have said very little, like men walking with Him on the earth. There remains the eagle; this is John, the preacher of sublime truths, and a contemplator with steady gaze of the inner and eternal light. It is said, indeed, that the young eagles are tested by the parent birds in this way: the young one is suspended from the talons of the male parent and directly exposed to the rays of the sun; if it looks steadily at the sun, it is recognized as a true brood; if its eye quivers, it is allowed to drop off, as a spurious brood. Now, therefore, consider how sublime are the things he ought to speak who is compared to the eagle; and yet even we, who creep on the earth, weak and hardly of any account among men, venture to handle and to expound these things; and imagine that we can either apprehend when we meditate them, or be apprehended when we speak.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p14"></A>6. Why have I said this? For perhaps after these words one may justly say to me: Lay aside the book then. Why dost thou take in hand what exceeds thy measure? Why trust thy tongue to it? To this I reply: Many heretics abound; and God has permitted them to abound to this end, that we may not be always nourished with milk and remain in senseless infancy. For inasmuch as they have not understood how the divinity of Christ is set forth to our acceptance, they have concluded according to their will: and by not discerning aright, they have brought in most troublesome questions upon catholic believers; and the hearts of believers began to be disturbed and to waver. Then immediately it became a necessity for spiritual men, who had not only read in the Gospel anything respecting the divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, but had also understood it, to bring forth the armor of Christ against the armor of the devil, and with all their might to fight in most open conflict for the divinity of Christ against false and deceitful teachers; lest, while they were silent, others might perish. For whoever have thought either that our Lord Jesus Christ is of another substance than the Father is, or that there is only Christ, so that the same is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; whoever also have chosen to think that He was only man, not God made man, or God in such wise as to be mutable in His Godhead, or God in such wise as not to   <A NAME="page_211"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 211</FONT></A> <a name="iii.xxxvii-Page_211"></A>be man; these have made shipwreck from the faith, and have been cast forth from the harbor of the Church, lest by their inquietude they might wreck the ships in their company. Which thing obliged that even we, though least and as regards ourselves wholly unworthy, but in regard of His mercy set in some account among His stewards, should speak to you what either you may understand and rejoice with me, or, if you cannot yet understand, by believing it you may remain secure in the harbor.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p15"></A>7. I will accordingly speak; let him who can, understand; and let him who cannot understand, believe: yet will I speak what the Lord saith, &#8220;Ye judge after the flesh; I judge not any man,&#8221; either now, or after the flesh. &#8220;But even, if I judge, my judgment is true.&#8221; Why is Thy judgment true? &#8220;Because I am not alone,&#8221; saith He, &#8220;but I and the Father that sent me.&#8221; What then, O Lord Jesus? If Thou wert alone would Thy judgment be false: and is it because Thou art not alone, but Thou and the Father that sent Thee, that Thou judgest truly? How shall I answer? Let Himself answer: He saith, &#8220;My judgment is true.&#8221; Why? &#8220;Because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.&#8221; If He is with Thee, how has He sent Thee? And has He sent Thee, and yet is He also with Thee? Is it so that having been sent, Thou hast not departed from Him? And didst Thou come to us, and yet abode there? How is this to be believed? how apprehended? To these two questions I answer: Thou sayest rightly, how is it to be apprehended; how believed, thou sayest not rightly. Rather, for that reason is it right to believe it, because it is not immediately to be apprehended; for if it were a thing to be immediately apprehended, there would be no need to believe it, because it would be seen. It is because thou dost not apprehend that thou believest; but by believing thou art made capable of apprehending. For if thou dost not believe, thou wilt never apprehend, since thou wilt remain less capable. Let faith then purify thee, that understanding may fill thee. &#8220;My judgment is true,&#8221; saith He, &#8220;because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.&#8221; Therefore, O Lord our God, Jesus Christ, Thy sending is Thy incarnation. So I see, so I understand: in short, so I believe, in case it may smack of arrogance to say, so I understand. Doubtless the Lord Jesus Christ is even here; rather, was here as to His flesh, is here now as to His Godhead: He was both with the Father and had not left the Father. Hence, in that He is said to have been sent and to have come to us, His incarnation is set forth to us, for the Father did not take flesh.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p16"></A>8. For there are certain heretics called Sabellians, who are also called Patripassians, who affirm that it was the Father Himself that had suffered. Do not thou so affirm, O Catholic; for if thou wilt be a Patripassian, thou wilt not be sane. Understand, then, that the incarnation of the Son is termed the sending of the Son; and do not believe that the Father was incarnate, but do not yet believe that He departed from the incarnate Son. The Son carried flesh, the Father was with the Son. If the Father was in heaven, the Son on earth, how was the Father with the Son? Because both Father and Son were everywhere: for God is not in such manner in heaven as not to be on earth. Hear him who would flee from the judgment of God, and found not a way to flee by: &#8220;Whither shall I go,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;from Thy Spirit; and whither shall I flee from Thy face? If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there.&#8221; The question was about the earth; hear what follows: &#8220;If I descend unto hell, Thou art there.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_670"></A><A HREF="#fn_670"><FONT SIZE="1">671</FONT></A>
 If, then, He is said to be present even in hell, what in the universe remains where He is not present? For the voice of God with the prophet is, &#8220;I fill heaven and earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_671"></A><A HREF="#fn_671"><FONT SIZE="1">672</FONT></A>
 Hence He is everywhere, who is confined by no place. Turn not thou away from Him, and He is with thee. If thou wouldst come to Him, be not slow to love; for it is not with feet but with affections thou runnest. Thou comest while remaining in one place, if thou believest and lovest. Wherefore He is everywhere; and if everywhere, how not also with the Son? Is it so that He is not with the Son, while, if thou believest, He is even with thee?</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p19"></A>9. How, then, is His judgment true, but because the Son is true? For this He said: &#8220;And if I judge, my judgment is true; because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.&#8221; Just as if He had said, &#8220;My judgment is true,&#8221; because I am the Son of God. How dost Thou prove that Thou art the Son of God? &#8220;Because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.&#8221; Blush, Sabellian; thou hearest the <i> Son</i>, thou hearest the <i>Father</i>. Father is Father, Son is Son. He said not, I am the Father, and I the same am the Son; but He saith, &#8220;I am not alone.&#8221; Why art Thou not alone? Because the Father is with me. &#8220;I am, and the Father that sent me;&#8221; thou hearest, &#8220;I am, and He that sent me.&#8221; Lest thou lose sight of the person, distinguish the persons. Distin  <A NAME="page_212"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 212</FONT></A> <a name="iii.xxxvii-Page_212"></A>guish by understanding, do not separate by faithlessness; lest again, fleeing as it were Charybdis, thou rush upon Scylla. For the whirlpool of the impiety of the Sabellians was swallowing thee, to say that the Father is the same who is Son: just now thou hast learned, &#8220;I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.&#8221; Thou dost acknowledge that the Father is Father, and that the Son is Son; thou dost rightly acknowledge: but do not say the Father is greater, the Son is less; do not say, the Father is gold, the Son is silver. There is one substance, one Godhead, one co-eternity, perfect equality, no unlikeness. For if thou only believe that Christ is another, not the same person that the Father is, but yet imagine that in respect of His nature He is somewhat different from the Father, thou hast indeed escaped Charybdis, but thou hast been wrecked on the rocks of Scylla. Steer the middle course, avoid each of the two perilous sides. Father is Father, Son is Son. Thou sayest now, Father is Father, Son is Son: thou hast fortunately escaped the danger of the absorbing whirl; why wouldst thou go unto the other side to say, the Father is this, the Son that? The Son is another person than the Father is, this thou sayest rightly; but that He is different in nature, thou sayest not rightly. Certainly the Son is another person, because He is not the same who is Father and the Father is another person, because He is not the same who is Son: nevertheless, they are not different in nature, but the selfsame is both Father and Son. What means the self-same? God is one. Thou hast heard, &#8220;Because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me:&#8221; hear how thou mayest believe Father and Son; hear the Son Himself, &#8220;I and the Father are one.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_672"></A><A HREF="#fn_672"><FONT SIZE="1">673</FONT></A>
 He said not, I am the Father; or, I and the Father <i>is</i> one person; but when He says, &#8220;I and the Father are one,&#8221; hear both, both the <i>one, unum</i>, and the <i>are, sumus</i>, and thou shalt be delivered both from Charybdis and from Scylla. In these two words, in that He said <i>one</i>, He delivers thee from Arius; in that He said <i>are</i>, He delivers thee from Sabellius. If <i> one</i>, therefore not diverse; if <i>are</i>, therefore both Father and Son. For He would not say <i>are</i> of one person; but, on the other hand, He would not say <i>one</i> of diverse. Hence the reason why He says, &#8220;my judgment is true,&#8221; is, that thou mayest hear it briefly, because I am the Son of God. But I would have thee in such wise believe that I am the Son of God, that thou mayest understand that the Father is with me: I am not Son in such manner as to have left Him; I am not in such manner here that I should not be with Him; nor is He in such manner there as not to be with me: I have taken to me the form of a servant, yet have I not lost the form of God; therefore He saith, &#8220;I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p21"></A>10. He had spoken of judgment; He means to speak of testimony. &#8220;In your law,&#8221; saith He, &#8220;it is written that the testimony of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.&#8221; He expounded the law to them also, if they were not unthankful. For it is a great question, my brethren, and to me it certainly appears to have been ordained in a mystery, where God said, &#8220;In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall stand.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_673"><FONT SIZE="1">674</FONT></A>
 Is truth sought by two witnesses? Clearly it is; so is the custom of mankind: but yet it may be that even two witnesses lie. The chaste Susanna was pressed by two false witnesses: were they not therefore false because they were two? Do we speak of two or of three? A whole people lied against Christ.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_674"></A><A HREF="#fn_674"><FONT SIZE="1">675</FONT></A>
 If, then, a people, consisting of a great multitude of men, was found a false witness, how is it to be understood that &#8220;in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall stand,&#8221; unless it be that in this manner the Trinity is mysteriously set forth to us, in which is perpetual stability of truth? Dost thou wish to have a good cause? Have two or three witnesses,&#8212;the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. In short, when Susanna, the chaste woman and faithful wife, was pressed by two false witnesses, the Trinity supported her in her conscience and in secret: that Trinity raised up from secrecy one witness, Daniel, and convicted the two.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_675"><FONT SIZE="1">676</FONT></A>
 Therefore, because it is written in your law that the witness of two men is true, receive our witness, lest ye feel our judgment. &#8220;For I,&#8221; saith He, &#8220;judge not any man; but I bear witness of myself:&#8221; I defer judgment, I defer not the witness.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p25"></A>11. Let us, brethren, choose for ourselves God as our judge, God as our witness, against the tongues of men, against the weak suspicions of mankind. For He who is the judge disdains not to be witness, nor is He advanced in honor when He becomes judge; since He who is witness will also Himself be judge. In what way is He witness? Because He asks not another to learn from Him who thou art. In what way is He judge? Because He has the power of killing and making alive, of condemning and acquitting, of casting down   <A NAME="page_213"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 213</FONT></A> <a name="iii.xxxvii-Page_213"></A>into hell and of raising up into heaven, of joining to the devil and of crowning with the angels. Since, therefore, He has this power, He is judge. Now, because He requires not another witness that He may know thee; and that He who will hereafter judge thee is now seeing thee, there is no means whereby thou canst deceive Him when He begins to judge. For there is no furnishing thyself with false witnesses who can circumvent that judge when He shall begin to judge thee. This is what God says to thee: When thou despisedst, I did see it; and when thou believedst not, I did not frustrate my sentence. I delayed it, not removed it. Thou wouldst not hear what I enjoined, thou shalt feel what I foretold. But if thou hearest what I enjoined, thou shalt not feel the evils which I have foretold, but thou shalt enjoy the good things which I have promised.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p26"></A>12. Let it not by any means surprise any one that He says, &#8220;My judgment is true; because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me;&#8221; whilst He has said in another place, &#8220;The Father judgeth not any man, but all judgment hath He given to the Son.&#8221; We have already discoursed on these same words of the evangelist, and we remind you now that this was not said because the Father will not be with the Son when He comes to judge, but because the Son alone will be apparent to the good and the bad in the judgment, in that form in which He suffered, and rose again, and ascended into heaven. For at that moment, indeed, as they were beholding Him ascending, the angelic voice sounded in the ears of His disciples, &#8220;So shall He come in like manner as ye have seen Him going into heaven;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">677</FONT></A>
 that is, in the form of man in which He was judged, will He judge, in order that also that prophetic utterance may be fulfilled, &#8220;They shall look upon Him whom they pierced.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">678</FONT></A>
 But when the righteous go into eternal life, we shall see Him as He is; that will not be the judgment of the living and the dead, but only the reward of the living.</p>  
<p><a name="iii.xxxvii-p29"></A>13. Likewise, let it not surprise you that He says, &#8220;In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true,&#8221; that any man should hence suppose that this was not also the law of God, because it is not said, <i>In the law of God</i>: let him know that, when it is said thus, <i>In your law</i>, it is just as if He said, &#8220;In the law which was given to you;&#8221; given by whom, except by God? Just as we say, &#8220;Our daily bread;&#8221; and yet we say, &#8220;Give us this day.&#8221;</p>
