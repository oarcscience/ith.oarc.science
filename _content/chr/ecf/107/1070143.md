<span id="iv.xv"></span>

<span id="iv.xv-p1"></span> *De Sermone Domini in Monte, lib. i. 22, §
73.*

<span id="iv.xv-p2"></span>[1 John
5.16](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#016)<span id="iv.xv-p2.1"></span>. *Si
quis scit peccare fratrem suum peccatum non ad mortem, postulabit, et
dabit illi Dominus vitam qui peccat non ad mortem; est autem peccatum ad
mortem; non pro illo dico ut roget.*

<span id="iv.xv-p3"></span>But what presses harder upon the present
question \[in the Lord’s command of praying for enemies and
persecutors\] is that saying of the apostle John, “If any man know that
his brother sinneth a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and the Lord
will give life to that man who sinneth not unto death: but there is a
sin unto death: not for that do I say that he should ask.” For it
manifestly shows that there are some “brethren” whom we are not
commanded to pray for, whereas the Lord bids us pray even for our
persecutors. Nor can this question be solved except we acknowledge, that
there are some sins in brethren that are worse than the sin of enemies
in persecuting. That “brethren” mean Christians, may be proved by many
texts of Holy Writ; the plainest, however, is that of the apostle which
he puts thus: “For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife,
and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother.”  <span
id="fr_2549"></span>[2550](#fn_2549) For he has not added *our*; but
thought it plain enough, when by the term *brother* he spake of the
Christian that should have an unbelieving wife. And accordingly he says
just afterwards, “But if the unbelieving depart, let her depart: but a
brother or sister is not put under servitude in a matter of this sort.”
The “sin,” therefore, of a brother, “unto death,” I suppose to be when,
after the acknowledging of God through the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, one fights against the brotherhood, and is set on by the
fire-brands of hatred <span id="fr_2550"></span>[2551](#fn_2550) against
the very grace through which he was reconciled to God. <span
id="fr_2551"></span>[2552](#fn_2551) But “a sin not unto death” is when
a person, not having alienated his love from his brother, yet through
some infirmity of mind may have failed to exhibit the due offices of
brotherhood. Wherefore, on the one hand, the Lord on the cross said,
“Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,” <span
id="fr_2552"></span>[2553](#fn_2552) since they had not yet, by being
made partakers of the grace of the Holy Spirit, entered into the
fellowship of holy brotherhood; and blessed Stephen in the Acts of the
Apostles prays for them who are stoning him; <span
id="fr_2553"></span>[2554](#fn_2553) because they had not yet believed
Christ, and were not fighting against that grace of communion. On the
other hand, the apostle Paul does not pray for Alexander, and the reason
I suppose, is, that this man was a brother, and had sinned “unto death,”
*i.e.* by opposing the brotherhood in a spirit of hatred. <span
id="fr_2554"></span>[2555](#fn_2554) Whereas for such as had not broken
off the bonds of love, but had given way through fear, he prays that
they may be forgiven. For so he says: “Alexander the coppersmith did me
much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: of whom be thou
ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.” <span
id="fr_2555"></span>[2556](#fn_2555) Then he subjoins for whom he prays,
saying, “At my first answer no man <span id="page_528">p. 528</span>
<span id="iv.xv-Page_528"></span>stood with me, but all men forsook me:
I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.” This difference of
sins it is that distinguishes Judas with his treason from Peter with his
denial. Not that to him who repenteth there is to be no forgiveness:
lest we go against that sentence of the Lord, in which He commands
always to forgive the brother who asks his brother’s forgiveness: <span
id="fr_2556"></span>[2557](#fn_2556) but that the mischief of that sin
is, that the man cannot submit to the humiliation of begging for pardon,
even when he is forced by his evil conscience both to acknowledge and to
publish his sin. For when Judas had said, “I have sinned, in that I have
betrayed the innocent blood,” <span id="fr_2557"></span>[2558](#fn_2557)
he went and hanged himself in desperation, rather than pray for
forgiveness in humiliation. Wherefore it makes a great difference, what
sort of repentance God forgives. For many are much quicker than others
to confess that they have sinned, and are angry with themselves in such
sort that they vehemently wish they had not sinned, while yet they
cannot lay down their pride, and submit to have the heart humbled and
broken so as to implore pardon: a state of mind which one may well
believe to be, for the greatness of their sin, a part of their already
begun damnation.

<span id="iv.xv-p13"></span>And this, perhaps, it is “to sin against the
Holy Ghost:” <span id="fr_2558"></span>[2559](#fn_2558) *i.e.* through
malice and envy to fight against brotherly charity after receiving the
grace of the Holy Spirit: that sin which the Lord saith hath no
forgiveness, either here or in the world to come. . . . For the Lord in
saying to the Pharisees, “Whosoever shall speak an evil word against the
Son of Man,” <span id="fr_2559"></span>[2560](#fn_2559) &c., may have
meant to warn them to come to the grace of God, and having received it,
not to sin as they have now sinned. For now they have spoken an evil
word against the Son of Man, and it may be forgiven them, if they be
converted and believe and receive the Holy Spirit: which when they have
received, if they will then have ill-will against the brotherhood and
oppose the grace they have received, there is no forgiveness for them,
either in this world or in the world to come.

this passage: “I have not positively affirmed it to be so, for I have
said, ‘I suppose:’ still it should have been added, ‘if in this so
wicked perversity of mind he departs this life:’ since we have certainly
no right to despair of any ever so wicked man so long as he is in this
life, and it cannot be unwise to pray for that man of whom we do not
despair.” Comp. Serm. lxxi. 21.

<span id="iv.xv-p9"></span> So the traditional interpretation of the
Greeks in Œcumenius. “This ‘alone’ is ‘the sin unto death,’ *viz*. sin
which has no thought of repentance: which sin Judas being diseased
withal, was brought to eternal death.” Especially (he adds) the sin of
an unforgiving spirit, impenitently persisted in: “For the ways of the
resentful are unto death,” saith Solomon ([Prov. xii.
28](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#028)<span id="iv.xv-p9.1"></span>, LXX
