<span id="iv.xiv-p1"></span> *Contra Maximinum, lib*. ii. c. 22 §. 3.

<span id="iv.xiv-p2"></span>[1 John
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#007),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#008)<span id="iv.xiv-p2.1"></span>*.
Tres sunt testes; spiritus, et aqua, et sanguis; et tres unum
sunt.* <span id="fr_2540"></span>[2541](#fn_2540)

<span id="iv.xiv-p4"></span>I would not have thee mistake that place in
the epistle of John the apostle where he saith, “There are three
witnesses: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three are
one.” Lest haply thou say that the Spirit and the water and the blood
are diverse substances, and yet it is said, “the three are one:” for
this cause I have admonished thee, that thou mistake not the matter. For
these are mystical expressions,  <span
id="fr_2541"></span>[2542](#fn_2541) in which the point always to be
considered is, not what the actual things are, but what they denote as
signs: since they are signs of things, and what they are in their
essence is one thing, what they are in their signification another. If
then we understand the things signified, we do find these things to be
of one substance. Thus, if we should say, the rock and the water are
one, meaning by the Rock, Christ; by the water, the Holy Ghost: who
doubts that rock and water are two different substances? yet because
Christ and the Holy Spirit are of one and the same nature, therefore
when one says, the rock and the water are one, this can be rightly taken
in this behalf, that these two things of which the nature is diverse,
are signs of other things of which the nature is one. Three things then
we know to have issued from the Body of the Lord when He hung upon the
tree: first, the spirit: of which it is written, “And He bowed the head
and gave up the spirit:”  <span id="fr_2542"></span>[2543](#fn_2542)
then, as His side was pierced by the spear, “blood and water.” Which
three things if we look at as they are in themselves, they are in
substance several and distinct, and therefore they are not one. But if
we will inquire into the things signified by these, there not
unreasonably comes into our thoughts the Trinity itself, which is the
One, Only, True, Supreme God, Father and Son and Holy Ghost, of whom it
could most truly be said, “There are Three Witnesses, and the Three are
One:” so that by the term *Spirit* we should understand God the Father
to be signified; as indeed it was concerning the worshipping of Him that
the Lord was speaking, when He said, “God is a Spirit:” <span
id="fr_2543"></span>[2544](#fn_2543) by the term, *blood*, the Son;
because “the Word was made flesh:” <span
id="fr_2544"></span>[2545](#fn_2544) and by the term *water*, the Holy
Ghost; as, when Jesus spake of the water which He would give to them
that thirst, the evangelist saith, “But this said He of the Spirit which
they that believed on Him were to receive.” <span
id="fr_2545"></span>[2546](#fn_2545) Moreover, that the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost are “Witnesses,” who that believes the Gospel can doubt, when
the Son saith, “I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father
that sent me, He beareth witness of me.” <span
id="fr_2546"></span>[2547](#fn_2546) Where, though the Holy Ghost is not
men <span id="page_527">p. 527</span> <span
id="iv.xiv-Page_527"></span>tioned, yet He is not to be thought
separated from them. Howbeit neither concerning the Spirit hath He kept
silence elsewhere, and that He too is a witness hath been sufficiently
and openly shown. For in promising Him He said, “He shall bear witness
of me.” <span id="fr_2547"></span>[2548](#fn_2547) These are the “Three
Witnesses,” and the Three are One, because of one substance. But
whereas, the signs by which they were signified came forth from the Body
of the Lord, herein they figured the Church preaching the Trinity, that
it hath one and the same nature: since these Three in threefold manner
signified are One, and the Church that preacheth them is the Body of
Christ. In this manner then the three things by which they are signified
came out from the Body of the Lord: like as from the Body of the Lord
sounded forth the command to “baptize the nations in the Name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.” <span
id="fr_2548"></span>[2549](#fn_2548) “In the name:” not, In the names:
for “these Three are One,” and One God is these Three. And if in any
other way this depth of mystery which we read in John’s epistle can be
expounded and understood agreeably with the Catholic faith, which
neither confounds nor divides the Trinity, neither believes the
substances diverse nor denies that the persons are three, it is on no
account to be rejected. For whenever in Holy Scriptures in order to
exercise the minds of the faithful any thing is put darkly, it is to be
joyfully welcomed if it can be in many ways but not unwisely expounded.

<span id="iv.xiv-p3"></span> The clause of “the Three Heavenly
Witnesses,” v. 7, appears to be wholly unknown to St. Augustin: a
circumstance left unexplained by Mill, who asserts that copies which had
the clause “abounded in Africa” in the interval between St. Cyprian and
the close of the fifth century.
