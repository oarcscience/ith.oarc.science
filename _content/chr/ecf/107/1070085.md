<span id="iii.lxxxiii-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxxxiii-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXXXII.</span>

<span id="iii.lxxxiii-p2"></span><span
id="iii.lxxxiii-p2.1"></span><span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxxxiii-p2.2"></span>Chapter XV. 8–10</span>.

<span id="iii.lxxxiii-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxxxiii-p3.1"></span>The</span> Saviour, in thus speaking to the
disciples, commends still more and more the grace whereby we are saved,
when He says, “Herein is my Father glorified, <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1394](#fn_1393) that ye bear very much fruit, and
be made my disciples.” Whether we say *glorified*, or *made bright*,
both are the rendering given us of one Greek verb, namely *doxazein*
(<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.lxxxiii-p4.1"></span>δοξάζειν</span>). For what is doxa (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.lxxxiii-p4.2"></span>δόξα</span>) in Greek,
is in Latin glory. I have thought it worth while to mention this,
because the apostle says, “If Abraham was justified by works, he hath
glory, but not before God.” <span id="fr_1394"></span>[1395](#fn_1394)
For this is the glory *before God*, <span id="page_347">p. 347</span>
<span id="iii.lxxxiii-Page_347"></span>whereby God, and not man, is
glorified, when he is justified, not by works, but by faith, so that
even his doing well is imparted to him by God; just as the branch, as I
have stated above, <span id="fr_1395"></span>[1396](#fn_1395) cannot
bear fruit of itself. For if herein God the Father is glorified, that we
bear much fruit, and be made the disciples of Christ, let us not credit
our own glory therewith, as if we had it of ourselves. For of Him is
such a grace, and accordingly therein the glory is not ours, but His.
Hence also, in another passage, after saying, “Let your light so shine
before men that they may see your good works;” to keep them from the
thought that such good works were of themselves, He immediately added,
“and may glorify your Father who is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_1396"></span>[1397](#fn_1396) For herein is the Father glorified,
that we bear much fruit, and be made the disciples of Christ. And by
whom are we so made, but by Him whose mercy hath forestalled us? For we
are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works. <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[1398](#fn_1397)

<span id="iii.lxxxiii-p9"></span>2. “As the Father hath loved me,” He
says, “so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.” Here, then, you
see, is the source of our good works. For whence should we have them,
were it not that faith worketh by love? <span
id="fr_1398"></span>[1399](#fn_1398) And how should we love, were it not
that we were first loved? With striking clearness is this declared by
the same evangelist in his epistle: “We love God because He first loved
us.” <span id="fr_1399"></span>[1400](#fn_1399) But when He says, “As
the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you,” He indicates no such
equality between our nature and His as there is between Himself and the
Father, but the grace whereby the Mediator between God and men is the
man Christ Jesus. <span id="fr_1400"></span>[1401](#fn_1400) For He is
pointed out as Mediator when He says, “The Father—me, and I—you.” For
the Father, indeed, also loveth us, but in Him; for herein is the Father
glorified, that we bear fruit in the vine, that is, in the Son, and so
be made His disciples.

<span id="iii.lxxxiii-p13"></span>3. “Continue ye,” He says, “in my
love.” How shall we continue? Listen to what follows: “If ye keep my
commandments, ye shall abide in my love.” Love brings about the keeping
of His commandments; but does the keeping of His commandments bring
about love? Who can doubt that it is love which precedes? For he has no
true ground for keeping the commandments who is destitute of love. And
so, in saying, “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love,”
He shows not the source from which love springs, but the means whereby
it is manifested. As if He said, Think not that ye abide in my love if
ye keep not my commandments; for it is only if ye have kept them that ye
shall abide. In other words, it will thus be made apparent that ye shall
abide in my love if ye keep my commandments. So that no one need deceive
himself by saying that he loveth Him, if he keepeth not His
commandments. For we love Him just in the same measure as we keep His
commandments; and the less we keep them, the less we love. And although,
when He saith, “Continue ye in my love,” it is not apparent what love He
spake of; whether the love we bear to Him, or that which He bears to us:
yet it is seen at once in the previous clause. For He had there said,
“So have I loved you;” and to these words He immediately adds, “Continue
ye in my love:” accordingly, it is that love which He bears to us. What,
then, do the words mean, “Continue ye in my love,” but just, continue ye
in my grace? And what do these mean, “If ye keep my commandments, ye
shall abide in my love,” but, hereby shall ye know that ye shall abide
in the love which I bear to you, if ye keep my commandments? It is not,
then, for the purpose of awakening His love to us that we first keep His
commandments; but this, that unless He loves us, we cannot keep His
commandments. This is a grace which lies all disclosed to the humble,
but is hid from the proud.

<span id="iii.lxxxiii-p14"></span>4. But what are we to make of that
which follows: “Even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide
in His love”? Here also He certainly intended us to understand that
fatherly love wherewith He was loved of the Father. For this was what He
has just said, “As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you;” and
then to these He added the words, “Continue ye in my love;” in that,
doubtless, wherewith I have loved you. Accordingly, when He says also of
the Father, “I abide in His love,” we are to understand it of that love
which was borne Him by the Father. But then, in this case also, is that
love which the Father bears to the Son referable to the same grace as
that wherewith we are loved of the Son: seeing that we on our part are
sons, not by nature, but by grace; while the Only-begotten is so by
nature and not by grace? Or is this even in the Son Himself to be
referred to His condition as man? Certainly so. For in saying, “As the
Father hath loved me, so have I loved you,” He pointed to the grace that
was His as Mediator. For Christ Jesus is the Mediator between God and
men, not in respect to His Godhead, but in respect to His manhood. <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[1402](#fn_1401) <span id="page_348">p. 348</span>
<span id="iii.lxxxiii-Page_348"></span>And certainly it is in reference
to this His human nature that we read, “And Jesus increased in wisdom
and age, and in favor \[grace\] with God and men.” <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[1403](#fn_1402) In harmony, therefore, with this,
we may rightly say that while human nature belongs not to the nature of
God, yet such human nature does by grace belong to the person of the
only-begotten Son of God; and that by grace so great, that there is none
greater, yea, none that even approaches equality. For there were no
merits that preceded that assumption of humanity, but all His merits
began with that very assumption. The Son, therefore, abideth in the love
wherewith the Father hath loved Him, and so hath kept His commandments.
For what are we to think of Him even as man, but that God is His lifter
up? <span id="fr_1403"></span>[1404](#fn_1403) for the Word was God, the
Only-begotten, co-eternal with Him that begat; but that He might be
given to us as Mediator, by grace ineffable, the Word was made flesh,
and dwelt among us. <span id="fr_1404"></span>[1405](#fn_1404)
