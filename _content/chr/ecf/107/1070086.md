<span id="iii.lxxxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c9"><span
id="iii.lxxxiv-p1.1"></span>Tractate LXXXIII.</span>

<span id="iii.lxxxiv-p2"></span><span id="iii.lxxxiv-p2.1"></span><span
class="c10"><span id="iii.lxxxiv-p2.2"></span>Chapter XV. 11, 12</span>.

<span id="iii.lxxxiv-p3"></span>1. <span class="c10"><span
id="iii.lxxxiv-p3.1"></span>You</span> have just heard, beloved, the
Lord saying to His disciples, “These things have I spoken unto you, that
my joy might be in you, and that your joy might be full.” And what else
is Christ’s joy in us, save that He is pleased to rejoice over us? And
what is this joy of ours which He says is to be made full, but our
having fellowship with Him? On this account He had said to the blessed
Peter, “If I wash thee not, thou shall have no part with me.” <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405) His joy, therefore, in us is the
grace He hath bestowed upon us: and that is also our joy. But over it He
rejoiced even from eternity, when He chose us before the foundation of
the world. <span id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406) Nor can we rightly
say that His joy was not full; for God’s joy was never at any time
imperfect. But that joy of His was not in us: for we, in whom it could
be, had as yet no existence; and even when our existence commenced, it
began not to be in Him. But in Him it always was, who in the infallible
truth of His own foreknowledge rejoiced that we should yet be His own.
Accordingly, He had a joy over us that was already full, when He
rejoiced in foreknowing and foreordaining us: and as little could there
be any fear intermingling in that joy of His, lest there should be any
possible failure in what He foreknew would be done by Himself. Nor, when
He began to do what He foreknew that He would do, was there any increase
to His joy as the expression of His blessedness; otherwise His making of
us must have added to His blessedness. Be such a supposition, brethren,
far from our thoughts; for the blessedness of God was neither less
without us, nor became greater because of us. His joy, therefore, over
our salvation, which was always in Him, when He foreknew and
foreordained us, began to be in us when He called us; and this joy we
properly call our own, as by it we, too, shall yet be blessed: but this
joy, as it is ours, increases and advances, and presses onward
perseveringly to its own completion. Accordingly, it has its beginning
in the faith of the regenerate, and its completion in the reward when
they rise again. Such is my opinion of the purport of the words, “These
things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might be in you, and that
your joy might be made full:” that *mine* “might be in you;” that
*yours* “might be made full.” For mine was always full, even before ye
were called, when ye were foreknown as those whom I was afterwards to
call; but it finds its place in you also, when ye are transformed into
that which I have foreknown regarding you. And “that yours may be full:”
for ye shall be blessed, what ye are not as yet; just as ye are now
created, who had no existence before.

<span id="iii.lxxxiv-p6"></span>2. “This,” He says, “is my injunction,
that ye love one another, as I have loved you.” Whether we call it
injunction or commandment, <span id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407)
both are the rendering of the same Greek word, *entolé* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.lxxxiv-p7.1"></span>ἐντολή</span>). But He
had already made this same announcement on a former occasion, when, as
ye ought to remember, I repounded it to you to the best of my
ability. <span id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408) For this is what He
says there, “A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one
another; as I have loved you, <span id="page_349">p. 349</span> <span
id="iii.lxxxiv-Page_349"></span>that ye also love one another.” <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409) And so the repetition of this
commandment is its commendation: only that there He said, “A new
commandment I give unto you;” and here, “This is my commandment:”
*there*, as if there had been no such commandment before; and *here*, as
if He had no other commandment to give them. But there it is spoken of
as “new,” to keep us from persevering in our old courses; here, it is
called “mine,” to keep us from treating it with contempt.

<span id="iii.lxxxiv-p10"></span>3. But when He said in this way here,
“This is my commandment,” as if there were none else, what are we to
think, my brethren? Is, then, the commandment about that love wherewith
we love one another, His only one? Is there not also another that is
still greater,—that we should love God? Or has God in very truth given
us such a charge about love alone, that we have no need of searching for
others? There are three things at least that the apostle commends when
he says, “But now abide faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
greatest of these is charity.” <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410) And although in charity, that is,
in love, are comprehended the two commandments; yet it is here declared
to be the greatest only, and not the sole one. Accordingly, what a host
of commandments are given us about faith, what a multitude about hope!
who is there that could collect them together, or suffice to number
them? But let us ponder the words of the same apostle: “Love is the
fullness of the law.” <span id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411) And so,
where there is love, what can be wanting? and where it is not, what is
there that can possibly be profitable? The devil believes, <span
id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412) but does not love: no one loveth
who doth not believe. One may, indeed, hope for pardon who does not
love, but he hopes in vain; but no one can despair who loves. Therefore,
where there is love, there of necessity will there be faith and hope;
and where there is the love of our neighbor, there also of necessity
will be the love of God. For he that loveth not God, how loveth he his
neighbour as himself, seeing that he loveth not even himself? Such an
one is both impious and iniquitous; and he that loveth iniquity,
manifestly loveth not, but hateth his own soul. <span
id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413) Let us, therefore, be holding fast
to this precept of the Lord, to love one another; and then all else that
is commanded we shall do, for all else we have contained in this. But
this love is distinguished from that which men bear to one another as
such; for in order to mark the distinction, it is added, “as I have
loved you.” And wherefore is it that Christ loveth us, but that we may
be fitted to reign with Christ? With this aim, therefore, let us also be
loving one another, that we may manifest the difference of our love from
that of others, who have no such motive in loving one another, because
the love itself is wanting. But those whose mutual love has the
possession of God Himself for its object, will truly love one another;
and, therefore, even for the very purpose of loving one another, they
love God. There is no such love as this in all men; for few have this
motive for their love one to another, that God may be all in all.  <span
