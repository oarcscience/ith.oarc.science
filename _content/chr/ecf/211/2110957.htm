<p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.ii.iv-p1"></A>Of the three sorts of monks which there are in Egypt.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.ii.iv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.ii.iv-p2.1"></A>Wherefore</span> you should first hear how or whence the system and beginning of our order took its rise. For only then can a man at all effectually be trained in any art he may wish, and be urged on to practise it diligently, when he has learnt the glory of its authors and founders. There are three kinds of monks in Egypt, of which two are admirable, the third is a poor sort of thing and by all means to be avoided. The first is that of the <i>C&#339;nobites</i>, who live together in a congregation and are governed by the direction of a single Elder: and of this kind there is the largest number of monks dwelling throughout the whole of Egypt. The second is that of the <i>anchorites</i>, who were first trained in the C&#339;nobium and then being made perfect in practical life chose the recesses of the desert: and in this order we also hope to gain a place. The third is the reprehensible one of the <i>Sarabaites</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2073"></A><A HREF="#fn_2073"><FONT SIZE="1">2074</FONT></A>
 And of these we will discourse more fully one by one in order. Of these three orders then you ought, as we said, first to know about the founders. For at once from this there may arise either a hatred for the order which is to be avoided, or a longing for that which is to be followed, because each way is sure to carry the man who follows it, to that end which its author and discoverer has reached.</p>
