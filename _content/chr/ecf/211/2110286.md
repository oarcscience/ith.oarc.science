#### <span id="iv.iii.i.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I. <span id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636)

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p2"></span>Of the Monk’s Girdle.

<span id="iv.iii.i.i-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i.i-p3.1"></span>As</span> we are going to speak of the
customs and rules of the monasteries, how by God’s grace can we better
begin than with the actual dress of the monks, for we shall then be able
to expound in due course their interior life when we have set their
outward man before your eyes. A monk, then, as a soldier of Christ ever
ready for battle, ought always to walk with his loins girded. For in
this fashion, too, the authority of Holy Scripture shows that they
walked who in the Old Testament started the original of this life,—I
mean Elijah and Elisha; and, moreover, we know that the leaders and
authors of the New Testament, viz., John, Peter, and Paul, and the
others of the same rank, walked in the same manner. And of these the
first-mentioned, who even in the Old Testament displayed the flowers of
a virgin life and an example of chastity and continence, when he had
been sent by the Lord to rebuke the messengers of Ahaziah, the wicked
king of Israel, because when confined by sickness he had intended to
consult Beelzebub, the god of Ekron, on the state of his health, and
thereupon the said prophet had met them and said that he should not come
down from the bed on which he lay,—this man was made known to the
bed-ridden king by the description of the character of his clothing. For
when the messengers returned to him and brought back the prophet’s
message, he asked what the man who had met them and spoken such words
was like and how he was dressed. “An hairy man,” they said, “and girt
with a girdle of leather about his loins;” and by this dress the king at
once saw that it was the man of God, and said: “It is Elijah the
Tishbite:” <span id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637) i.e., by the evidence
of the girdle and the look of the hairy and unkempt body he recognized
without the slightest doubt the man of God, because this was always
attached to him as he dwelt among so many thousands of Israelites, as if
it were impressed as some special sign of his own particular style. Of
John also, who came as a sort of sacred boundary between the Old and New
Testament, being both a beginning and an ending, we know by the
testimony of the Evangelist that “the same John had his raiment of
camel’s hair and a girdle of skin about his loins.” <span
id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638) When Peter also had been put in prison
by Herod and was to be brought forth to be slain on the next day, when
the angel stood by him he was charged: “Gird thyself and put on thy
shoes.” <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639) And the angel of the
Lord would certainly not have charged him to do this had he not seen
that for the sake of his night’s rest he had for a while freed his
wearied limbs from the girdle usually tied round them. Paul also, going
up to Jerusalem and soon to be put in chains by the Jews, was met at
Cæsarea by the prophet Agabus, who took his girdle and bound his hands
and feet <span id="page_202">p. 202</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i.i-Page_202"></span>to show by his bodily actions the
injuries which he was to suffer, and said: “So shall the Jews in
Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is, and deliver him into the
hands of the Gentiles.” <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640) And
surely the prophet would never have brought this forward, or have said
“the man whose girdle this is,” unless Paul had always been accustomed
to fasten it round his loins.
