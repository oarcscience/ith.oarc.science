#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.vii-p1"></span>Heretics usually cover their
doctrines with a cloak of holy Scripture.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.vii-p2"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.vii-p2.1"></span>For</span> as,” you say, “by man came
death, so by man came also the resurrection of the dead.” Do you
actually try to prove your wrong and impious notion by the witness of
the Apostle? And do you bring the “chosen vessel” into disgrace by
mixing him up with your wicked ideas? I mean, that, as you cannot
understand the author of your Salvation, therefore the Apostle must be
made out to have denied God. And yet, if you wanted to make use of
Apostolic witnesses, why did you rest contented with one, and pass over
all the others in silence? and why did you not at once add this: “Paul,
an Apostle not of men neither by man, but by Jesus Christ:” <span
id="fr_2608"></span>[2609](#fn_2608) or this: “We speak wisdom among the
perfect:” and presently: “Whom none,” says he, “of the princes of this
world knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord
of glory.” <span id="fr_2609"></span>[2610](#fn_2609) Or this: “For in
Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” <span
id="fr_2610"></span>[2611](#fn_2610) And: “One Lord Jesus Christ through
whom are all things.” <span id="fr_2611"></span>[2612](#fn_2611) Or do
you partly agree, and partly disagree with the Apostle, and only receive
him so far as in consequence of the Incarnation <span
id="fr_2612"></span>[2613](#fn_2612) he names Christ man, and repudiate
him where he speaks of Him as God? For Paul does not deny that Jesus is
man, but still he confesses that man is God: and declares that to
mankind the resurrection came by man in such a way that he shows that in
that man God arose. For see whether he declares that He who rose was
God, as he bears his witness that He who was crucified was the Lord of
glory.

Divinity, and so assert that he is to be worshipped together with God
but not as God.](2111183)
