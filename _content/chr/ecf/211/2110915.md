#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIV.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxiv-p1"></span>How the weak are harmful and cannot
bear wrongs.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xxiv-p2.1"></span>We</span> must note too the fact that the
nature of the weak is always such that they are quick and ready to offer
reproaches and sow the seeds of quarrels, while they themselves cannot
bear to be touched by the shadow of the very slightest wrong, and while
they are riding roughshod over us and flinging about wanton charges,
they are not able to bear even the slightest and most trivial ones
themselves. And so according to the aforesaid opinion of the Elders love
cannot last firm and unbroken except among men of the same purpose and
goodness. For at some time or other it is sure to be broken, however
carefully it may be guarded by one of them.
