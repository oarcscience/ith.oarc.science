#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vi-p1"></span>The answer to the question proposed.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.vi-p2.1"></span>Theodore</span>: Sometimes holy Scripture
is wont by an improper use of terms to use “evils” for “affliction;” not
that these are properly and in their nature evils, but because they are
imagined to be evils by those on whom they are brought for their good.
For when divine judgment is reasoning with men it must speak with the
language and feelings of men. For when a doctor for the sake of health
with good reason either cuts or cauterizes those who are suffering from
the inflammation of ulcers, it is considered an evil by those who have
to bear it. Nor are the spur and the whip pleasant to a restive horse.
Moreover all chastisement seems at the moment to be a bitter thing to
those who are chastised, as the Apostle says: “Now all chastisement for
the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it joy but sorrow; but
afterwards it will yield to them that are exercised by it most peaceable
fruits of righteousness,” and “whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and
scourgeth every son whom He receiveth: for what son is there whom the
father doth not correct?” <span id="fr_1380"></span>[1381](#fn_1380) And
so evils are sometimes wont to stand for afflictions, as where we read:
“And God repented of the evil which He had said that He would do to them
and He did it not.” <span id="fr_1381"></span>[1382](#fn_1381) And
again: “For Thou, Lord, are gracious and merciful, patient and very
merciful and ready to repent of the evil,” <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[1383](#fn_1382) i.e., of the sufferings and losses
which Thou art forced to bring upon us as the reward of our sins. And
another prophet, knowing that these are profitable to some men, and
certainly not through any jealousy of their safety, but with an eye to
their good, prays thus: “Add evils to them, O Lord, add evils to the
haughty ones of the earth;” <span id="fr_1383"></span>[1384](#fn_1383)
and the Lord Himself says “Lo, I will bring evils upon them,” <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[1385](#fn_1384) i.e., sorrows, and losses, with
which they shall for the present be chastened for their soul’s health,
and so shall be at length driven to return and hasten back to Me whom in
their prosperity they scorned. And so that these are originally evil we
cannot possibly assert: for to many they conduce to their good and offer
the occasions of eternal bliss, and therefore (to return to the question
raised) all those things, which are thought to be brought upon us as
evils by our enemies or by any other people, should not be counted as
evils, but as things indifferent. For in the end they will not be what
he thinks, who brought them upon us in his rage and fury, but what *he*
makes them who endures them. And so when death has been brought upon a
saint, we ought not to think that an evil has happened to him but a
thing indifferent; which is an evil to a wicked man, while to the good
it is rest and freedom from evils. “For death is rest to a man whose way
is hidden.” <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1386](#fn_1385) And so a good man
does not suffer any loss from it, because he suffers nothing strange,
but by the crime of an enemy he only receives (and not without the
reward of eternal life) that which would have happened to him in the
course of nature, and pays the debt of man’s death, which must be paid
by an inevitable law, with the interest of a most fruitful passion, and
the recompense of a great reward.
