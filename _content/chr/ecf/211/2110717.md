#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.viii-p1"></span>The answer on the help of God and
the power of free will.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.viii-p2.1"></span>Serenus</span>: No one who has
experienced the conflicts of the inner man, can doubt that our foes are
continually lying in wait for us. But we mean that they oppose our
progress in such a way that we can think of them as only *inciting* to
evil things and not *forcing*. But no one could altogether avoid
whatever sin they were inclined to imprint upon our hearts, if a strong
impulse was present to force (evil) upon us, just as it is to suggest
it. Wherefore as there is in them ample power of inciting, so in us
there is a supply of power of rejection, and of liberty of acquiescing.
But if we are afraid of their power and assaults, we may also claim the
protection and assistance of God against them, of which we read: “For
greater is He who is in us than he who is in this world:” <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466) and His aid fights on our side with
much greater power than their hosts fight against us; for God is not
only the suggester of what is good, but the maintainer and insister of
it, so that sometimes He draws us towards salvation even against our
will and without our knowing it. It follows then that no one can be
deceived by the devil but one who has chosen to yield to him the consent
of his own will: as Ecclesiastes clearly puts it in these words: “For
since there is no gainsaying by those who do evil speedily, therefore
the heart of the children of men is filled within them to do
evil.” <span id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467)  It is therefore clear
that each man goes wrong from this; viz., that when evil thoughts
assault him he does not immediately meet them with refusal and
contradiction, for it says: “resist him, and he will flee from
you.” <span id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468)
