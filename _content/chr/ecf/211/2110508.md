#### <span id="iv.iii.x.xxiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXIII.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xxiii-p1"></span>That idleness is the reason why
there are not monasteries for monks in the West.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Hence</span> it is that in these
countries we see no monasteries found with such numbers of brethren: for
they are not supported by the resources of their own labour in such a
way that they can remain in them continually; and if in some way or
other, through the liberality of another, there should be a sufficient
provision to supply them, yet love of ease and restlessness of heart
does not suffer them to continue long in the place. Whence this saying
has been handed down from the old fathers in Egypt: that a monk who
works is attacked by but one devil; but an idler is tormented by
countless spirits.
