#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.ii-p1"></span>How vainglory attacks a monk not only
on his carnal, but also on his spiritual side.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.ii-p2.1"></span>For</span> not only does this, like the
rest of his faults, attack a monk on his carnal side, but on his
spiritual side as well, insinuating itself by craft and guile into his
mind: so that those who cannot be deceived by carnal vices are more
grievously wounded through their spiritual proficiency; and it is so
much the worse to fight against, as it is harder to guard against. For
the attack of all other vices is more open and straightforward, and in
the case of each of them, when he who stirs them up is met by a
determined refusal, he will go away the weaker for it, and the adversary
who has been beaten will on the next occasion attack his victim with
less vigour. But this malady when it has attacked the mind by means of
carnal pride, and has been repulsed by the shield of reply, again, like
some wickedness that takes many shapes, changes its former guise and
character, and under the appearance of the virtues tries to strike down
and destroy its conqueror.
