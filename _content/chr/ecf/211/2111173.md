#### <span id="iv.vii.vii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xxii-p1"></span>The hypostatic union enables us to
ascribe to God what belongs to the flesh in Christ.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vii.xxii-p2.1"></span>How</span> then is Christ (whom you
term a mere man) proclaimed in Holy Scripture to be God without
beginning, if by our own confession the Lord’s manhood <span
id="fr_2580"></span>[2581](#fn_2580) did not exist before His birth and
conception of a Virgin? And how can we read of so close a union of man
and God, as to make it appear that man was ever co-eternal with God, and
that afterwards God suffered with man: whereas we cannot believe that
man can be without beginning or that God can suffer? It is this which we
established in our previous writings; viz., that God being joined to
manhood, <span id="fr_2581"></span>[2582](#fn_2581) i.e., to His own
body, does not allow any separation to be made in men’s thoughts between
man and God. Nor will He permit anyone to hold that there is one Person
of the Son of man, and another Person of the Son of God. But in all the
holy Scriptures He joins together and as it were incorporates in the
Godhead, the Lord’s manhood, <span id="fr_2582"></span>[2583](#fn_2582)
so that no one can sever man from God in time, nor God from man at His
Passion. For if you regard Him in time, you will find that the Son of
man is ever with the Son of God. If you take note of His Passion, you
will find that the Son of God is ever with the Son of man, and that
Christ the Son of man and the Son of God is so one and indivisible,
that, in the language of holy Scripture, the man cannot be severed in
time from God, nor God from man at His Passion. Hence comes this: “No
man hath ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even
the Son of man who is in heaven.” <span
id="fr_2583"></span>[2584](#fn_2583) Where the Son of God while He was
speaking on earth testified that the Son of man was in heaven: and
testified that the same Son of man, who, He said, would ascend into
heaven, had previously come down from heaven. And this: “What and if ye
shall see the Son of man ascend up where He was before,” <span
id="fr_2584"></span>[2585](#fn_2584) where He gives the name of Him who
was born of man, but affirms that He ever was up on high. And the
Apostle also, when considering what happened in time, says that all
things were made by Christ. For he says, “There is one Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom are all things.” <span
id="fr_2585"></span>[2586](#fn_2585) But when speaking of His Passion,
he shows that the Lord of glory was crucified. “For if,” he says, “they
had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.” <span
id="fr_2586"></span>[2587](#fn_2586) And so too the Creed speaking of
the only and first-begotten Lord Jesus Christ, “Very God of Very God,
Being of one substance with the Father, and the Maker of all things,”
affirms that He was born of the Virgin and crucified and afterwards
buried. Thus joining in one body (as it were) the Son of God and of man,
and uniting God and man, so that there can be no severance either in
time or at the Passion, since the Lord Jesus Christ is shown to be one
and the same Person, both as God through all eternity, and as man
through the endurance of His Passion; and though we cannot say that man
is without beginning or that God is passible, yet in the one Person of
the Lord Jesus Christ we can speak of man as eternal, and of God as
dead. You see then that Christ means the whole Person, and that the name
represents both natures, for both man and God are born, and so it takes
in the whole Person so that when this name is used we see that no part
is left out. There was not then before the birth of a Virgin the same
eternity belonging in the past to the manhood as to the Divinity, but
because Divinity was united to manhood in the womb of the Virgin, it
follows that when we use the name of Christ one cannot be spoken of
without the other.
