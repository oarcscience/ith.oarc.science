#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxii-p1"></span>That every proud soul is subject to
spiritual wickedness to be deceived by it.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xxii-p2.1"></span>And</span> this clearly shows that
every soul of which the swellings of pride have taken possession, is
given over to the Syrians of the soul, <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075) i.e., to spiritual wickedness, and
that it is entangled in the lusts of the flesh, that the soul being at
last humbled by earthly faults, and carnally polluted, may recognize its
uncleanness, though while it stood erect in the coldness of its heart,
it could not understand that through pride of heart it was rendered
unclean in the sight of God; and by this means being humbled, a man may
get rid of his former coldness, and being cast down and confused with
the shame of his fleshly lusts, may thenceforward hasten to betake
himself the more eagerly towards fervour and warmth of spirit.
