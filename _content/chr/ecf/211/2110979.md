#### <span id="iv.vi.iii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.ix-p1"></span>Of true and complete perfection.

<span id="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>But</span> this is <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2.2"></span>μερική</span>, i.e.,
no thorough and altogether complete perfection, but only a partial one.
Perfection then is very rare and granted by God’s gift to but a very
few. For he is truly and not partially perfect who with equal
imperturbability can put up with the squalor of the wilderness in the
desert, as well as the infirmities of the brethren in the Cœnobium. And
so it is hard to find one who is perfect in both lives, because the
anchorite cannot thoroughly acquire <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2.3"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2.4"></span>κτημοσύνη</span> , i.e., a disregard for
and stripping oneself of material things, nor the Cœnobite purity in
contemplation, although we know that Abbot Moses and Paphnutius and the
two Macarii <span id="fr_2113"></span>[2114](#fn_2113) were masters of
both in perfection. And so they were perfect in either life, and while
they withdrew further than all the dwellers in the desert and delighted
themselves unceasingly in the retirement of the wilderness, and as far
as in them lay never sought intercourse with other men, yet they put up
with the presence and the infirmities of those who came to them so that
when a large number of the brethren came to them for the sake of seeing
them and profiting by it, they endured this almost continuous trouble of
receiving them with imperturbable patience, and men fancied that all the
days of their life they had neither learnt nor practised anything but
how to show common civility to those who came, so that it was a puzzle
to all to say in which life their zeal was mainly shown, i.e., whether
their greatness adapted itself more remarkably to the purity of the
hermitage or to the common life.
