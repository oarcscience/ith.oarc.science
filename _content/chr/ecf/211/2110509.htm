 who every year burnt with fire all the works of his hands.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.x.xxiv-p3"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.x.xxiv-p3.1"></A>Lastly</span>, Abbot Paul, one of the greatest of the Fathers, while he was living in a vast desert which is called the Porphyrian desert,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1000"></A><A HREF="#fn_1000"><FONT SIZE="1">1001</FONT></A>

And when his cave had been filled with a whole year&#146;s work, each year he would burn with fire that at which he had so diligently laboured: thus proving that without manual labour a monk cannot stop in a place nor rise to the heights of perfection: so that, though the need for food did not require this to be done, yet he performed it simply for the sake of purifying his heart, and strengthening his thoughts, and persisting in his cell, and gaining a victory over accidie and driving it away.</p>
