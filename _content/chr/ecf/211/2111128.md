#### <span id="iv.vii.v.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vii.v.vii-p1"></span>He returns to the former subject, in
order to show against the Nestorians that those things are said of the
man, which belong to the Divine nature as it were of a Person of Divine
nature, and conversely that those things are said of God, which belong
to the human nature as it were of a Person of human nature, because
there is in Christ but one and a single Personal self.

<span id="iv.vii.v.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.v.vii-p2.1"></span>And</span> so following the guidance of
the sacred word we may now say fearlessly and unhesitatingly that the
Son of man came down from heaven, and that the Lord of Glory was
crucified: because in virtue of the mystery of the Incarnation, the Son
of God became Son of man, and the Lord of Glory was crucified in (the
nature of) the Son of man. <span id="fr_2466"></span>[2467](#fn_2466)
What more is there need of? It would take too long to go into details:
for time would fail me, were I to try to examine and explain everything
which could be brought to bear on this subject. For one who wished to do
this would have to study and read the whole Bible. For what is there
which does not bear on this, when all Scripture was written with
reference to this? We must then say—as far as can be said—some things
briefly and cursorily, and enumerate rather than explain them, and
sacrifice some to save the rest, as for this reason it would certainly
be well hurriedly to run through some points, lest one should be
obliged <span id="fr_2467"></span>[2468](#fn_2467) to pass over almost
everything in silence. The Saviour then in the gospel says that “the Son
of man is come to save what was lost.” <span
id="fr_2468"></span>[2469](#fn_2468) And the Apostle says: “This is a
faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation; that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.” <span
id="fr_2469"></span>[2470](#fn_2469) But the Evangelist John also says:
“He came unto his own, and His own received Him not.” <span
id="fr_2470"></span>[2471](#fn_2470) You see then that Scripture says in
one place that the Son of man, in another Jesus Christ, in another the
Word of God came into the world. And so we must hold that the difference
is one of title not of fact, and that under the appearance of different
names there is but one Power \[or Person\]. For though at one time we
are told that the Son of man, and at another that the Son of God came
into the world, but one Person is meant under both names.

<span id="iv.vii.v.vii-p3"></span> See Hooker as above (V. liii. 4)
“When the Apostle saith of the Jews that they crucified the Lord of
Glory, and when the Son of man being on earth affirmeth that the Son of
man was in heaven at the same instant, there is in these two speeches
that mutual circulation before mentioned. In the one, there is
attributed to God or the Lord of Glory death, whereof Divine nature is
not capable; in the other ubiquity unto man which human nature admitteth
not. Therefore by the Lord of Glory we must needs understand the whole
person of Christ, who being Lord of Glory, was indeed crucified, but not
in that nature for which he is termed the Lord of Glory. In like manner
by the Son of man the whole person of Christ must necessarily be meant,
who being man upon earth, filled heaven with his glorious presence, but
not according to that nature for which the title of man is given Him.”
