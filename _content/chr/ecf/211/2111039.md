#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.i-p1"></span>Discourse of Abbot Theonas on the
Apostle’s words: “For I do not the good which I would.”

<span id="iv.vi.vii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.i-p2.1"></span>At</span> the return of light therefore, as
the old man was forced by our intense urgency to investigate the depths
of the Apostle’s subject, he spoke as follows: As for the passages by
which you try to prove that the Apostle Paul spoke not in his own person
but in that of sinners: “For I do not the good that I would, but the
evil which I hate, that I do;” or this: “But if I do that which I would
not, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me;” or what
follows: “For I delight in the law of God after the inner man, but I see
another law in my members opposing the law of my mind, and bringing me
into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members;” <span
id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228) these passages on the contrary
plainly show that they cannot possibly fit the person of sinners, but
that what is said can only apply to those that are perfect, and that it
only suits the chastity of those who follow the good example of the
Apostles. Else how could these words apply to the person of sinners:
“For I do not the good which I would, but the evil which I hate that I
do”? or even this: “But if I do what I would not it is no longer I that
do it but sin that dwelleth in me”? For what sinner defiles himself
unwillingly by adulteries and fornication? Who against his will prepares
plots against his neighbour? Who is driven by unavoidable necessity to
oppress a man by false witness or cheat him by theft, or covet the goods
of another or shed his blood? Nay rather, as Scripture says, “Mankind is
diligently inclined to wickedness from his youth.” <span
id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229) For to such an extent are all
inflamed by the love of sin and desire to carry out what they like, that
they actually look out with watchful care for an opportunity of
committing wickedness and are afraid of being too slow to enjoy their
lusts, and glory in their shame and the mass of their crimes, as the
Apostle says in censure, <span id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230) and
seek credit for themselves out of their own confusion, of whom also the
prophet Jeremiah maintains that they commit their flagitious crimes not
only not unwillingly nor with ease of heart and body, but with laborious
efforts to such an extent that they come to toil to carry them out, so
that they are prevented even by the hindrance of arduous difficulty from
their deadly quest of sin; as he says: “They have laboured to do
wickedly.” <span id="fr_2231"></span>[2232](#fn_2231) Who also will say
that this applies to sinners: “And so with the mind I myself serve the
law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin,” as it is plain that they
serve God neither with the mind nor the flesh? Or how can those who sin
with the body serve God with the mind, when the flesh <span
id="page_520">p. 520</span> <span
id="iv.vi.vii.i-Page_520"></span>receives the incitement to sin from the
heart, and the Creator of either nature Himself declares that the fount
and spring of sin flows from the latter, saying: “From the heart proceed
evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness,
etc.” <span id="fr_2232"></span>[2233](#fn_2232) Wherefore it is clearly
shown that this cannot in any way be taken of the person of sinners, who
not only do not hate, but actually love what is evil and are so far from
serving God with either the mind or the flesh that they sin with the
mind before they do with the flesh, and before they carry out the
pleasures of the body are overcome by sin in their mind and thoughts.
