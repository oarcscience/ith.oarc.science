#### <span id="iv.iii.ix.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.xii-p1"></span>That except that wholesome sorrow,
which springs up in three ways, all sorrow and dejection should be
resisted as hurtful.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ix.xii-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> except that sorrow which
is endured either for the sake of saving penitence, or for the sake of
aiming at perfection, or for the desire of the future, all sorrow and
dejection must equally be resisted, as belonging to this world, and
being that which “worketh death,” and must be entirely expelled from our
hearts like the spirit of fornication and covetousness and anger.
