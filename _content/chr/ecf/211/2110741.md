<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxii-p1"></span>Of the different desires and
wishes which exist in the powers of the air.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxxii-p2.1"></span>But</span> it is clearly proved that
there exist in unclean spirits as many desires as there are in men. For
some of them, which are commonly called Plani, <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[1508](#fn_1507) are shown to be so seductive and
sportive that, when they have taken continual possession of certain
places or roads, they delight themselves not indeed with tormenting the
passers by whom they can deceive, but, contenting themselves merely with
laughing at them and mocking them, try to tire them out rather than to
injure them: while some spend the night merely by harmlessly taking
possession of men, though others are such slaves to fury and ferocity
that they are not simply content with hurting the bodies of those of
whom they have taken possession, by tearing them in a dreadful manner,
but actually are eager to rush upon those who are passing by at a
distance, and to attack them with most savage slaughter: like those
described in the gospel, for fear of whom no man dared to pass by that
way. And there is no doubt that these and such as these in their
insatiable fury delight in wars and bloodshed. Others we find affect the
hearts of those whom they have seized with empty pride, (and these are
commonly called Bacucei <span id="fr_1508"></span>[1509](#fn_1508) ) so
that they stretch themselves up beyond their proper height and at one
time puff themselves up with arrogance and pomposity, and at another
time condescend in an ordinary and bland manner, to a state of calmness
and affability: and as they fancy that they are great people and the
wonder of everybody, at one time show by bowing their body that they are
worshipping higher powers, while at another time they think that they
are worshipped by others, and so go through all those movements which
express true service either proudly or humbly. Others we find are not
only keen for lies, but also inspire men with blasphemies. And of this
we ourselves can testify as we have heard a demon openly confessing that
he had proclaimed a wicked and impious doctrine by the mouths of Arius
and Eunomius. And the same thing we read that one of them openly
proclaimed in the fourth book of Kings: “I will go forth,” he said, “and
will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.” <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1510](#fn_1509) On which the Apostle, when
reproving those who are deceived by them, adds as follows: “giving heed
to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in
hypocrisy.” <span id="fr_1510"></span>[1511](#fn_1510) And that there
are other kinds of devils which are deaf and dumb the gospels testify.
And that some spirits incite to lust and wantonness the prophet
maintains saying: “The spirit of fornication deceived them and they went
astray from their God.” <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1512](#fn_1511) In
the same way the authority of Scripture teaches us that there are demons
of the night and of the day and of the noonday: <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1513](#fn_1512) But it would take too long to
search through the whole of Scripture and run through the different
kinds of them, as they are termed by the prophets onocentaurs, satyrs,
sirens, witches, howlers, ostriches, urchins; and asps and basilisks in
the Psalms; and are called lions, dragons, scorpions in the gospel, and
are named by the Apostle the prince of this world, rulers of this
darkness, and spirits of wickedness. <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[1514](#fn_1513) And all these names we ought not to
take as given at random or hap-hazard, but as alluding to their
fierceness and madness under the sign of those wild beasts which are
more or less harmful and dangerous among us, and by comparing them to
the poisonous wickedness or power which among other beasts or serpents,
some pre-eminence in evil confers on them, they are called by their
names, in such a way that to one is assigned the name of lion because of
the fury of his rage and the madness of his anger, to another that of
basilisk because of his deadly poison, which kills a person before it is
perceived, and to another that of onocentaur or urchin or ostrich
because of his sluggish malice.
