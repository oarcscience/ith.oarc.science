#### <span id="iv.iv.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xi-p1"></span>On the abiding character of love.

<span id="iv.iv.ii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ii.xi-p2.1"></span>And</span> why do you wonder that those
duties enumerated above will cease, when the holy Apostle tells us that
even the higher gifts of the Holy Spirit will pass away: and points out
that charity alone will abide without end, saying “whether there be
prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease:
whether there be knowledge, it will <span id="page_300">p. 300</span>
<span id="iv.iv.ii.xi-Page_300"></span>come to an end,” but of this he
says “Charity never faileth.” For all gifts are given for a time as use
and need require, but when the dispensation is ended they will without
doubt presently pass away: but love will never be destroyed. For not
only does it work usefully in us in this world; but also in that to
come, when the burden of bodily needs is cast off, it will continue in
far greater vigour and excellence, and will never be weakened by any
defect, but by means of its perpetual incorruption will cling to God
more intently and earnestly. <span id="fr_1098"></span>[1099](#fn_1098)
