#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxiv-p1"></span>Of the saying of the same old man,
through which he taught by what efforts a monk can acquire a knowledge
of the Scriptures.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>This</span> man therefore, when some of
the brethren were wondering at the splendid light of his knowledge and
were asking of him some meanings of Scripture, said that a monk who
wanted to acquire a knowledge of the Scriptures ought not to spend his
labour on the works of commentators, but rather to keep all the efforts
of his mind and intentions of his heart set on purifying himself from
carnal vices: for when these are driven out, at once the eyes of the
heart, as if the veil of the passions were removed, will begin as it
were naturally to gaze on the mysteries <span
id="fr_869"></span>[870](#fn_869) of Scripture: since they were not
declared to us by the grace of the Holy Spirit in order that they should
remain unknown and obscure; but they are rendered obscure by our fault,
as the veil of our sins covers the eyes of the heart, and when these are
restored to their natural state of health, the mere reading of Holy
Scripture is by itself amply sufficient for beholding the true
knowledge, nor do they need the aid of commentators, just as these eyes
of flesh need no man’s teaching how to see, provided that they are free
from dimness or the darkness of blindness. For this reason there have
arisen so great differences and mistakes among commentators because most
of them, paying no sort of attention towards purifying the mind, rush
into the work of interpreting the Scriptures, and in proportion to the
density or impurity of their heart form opinions that are at variance
with and contrary to each other’s and to the faith, and so are unable to
take in the light of truth.
