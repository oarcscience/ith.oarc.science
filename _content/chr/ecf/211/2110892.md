#### <span id="iv.v.vii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.v.vii.i-p1"></span>What Abbot Joseph asked us in the first
instance.

<span id="iv.v.vii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> blessed Joseph, <span
id="fr_1962"></span>[1963](#fn_1962) whose instructions and precepts are
now to be set forth, and who was one of the three whom we mentioned in
the first Conference, <span id="fr_1963"></span>[1964](#fn_1963)
belonged to a most illustrious family, and was the chief man of his city
in Egypt, which was named Thmuis, <span
id="fr_1964"></span>[1965](#fn_1964) and so was carefully trained in the
eloquence of Greece as well as Egypt, so that he could talk admirably
with us or with those who were utterly ignorant of Egyptian, not as the
others did through an interpreter, but in his own person. And when he
found that we were anxious for instruction from him, he first inquired
whether we were own brothers, and when he heard that we were united in a
tie of spiritual and not carnal brotherhood, and that from the first
commencement of our renunciation of the world we had always been joined
together in an unbroken bond as well in our travels, which we had both
undertaken for the sake of spiritual service, as also in the pursuits of
the monastery, he began his discourse as follows.
