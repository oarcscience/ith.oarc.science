#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xx-p1"></span>How contemptible it is to be overcome
by covetousness.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xx-p2.1"></span>And</span> so if we want to strive
lawfully in our spiritual combat, let us expel this dangerous enemy also
from our hearts. For to overcome him does not so much show great virtue,
as to be beaten by him is shameful and disgraceful. For when you are
overpowered by a strong man, though there is grief in being overthrown,
and distress at the loss of victory, yet some consolation may be derived
by the vanquished <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span
id="iv.iii.vii.xx-Page_255"></span>from the strength of their opponent.
But if the enemy is a poor creature, and the struggle a feeble one,
besides the grief for defeat there is confusion of a more disgraceful
character, and a shame which is worse than loss.
