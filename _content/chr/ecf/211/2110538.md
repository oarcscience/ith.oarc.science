#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.vii-p1"></span>That the evil of pride is so great
that it rightly has even God Himself as its adversary.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.vii-p2.1"></span>How</span> great is the evil of pride,
that it rightly has no angel, nor other virtues opposed to it, but God
Himself as its adversary! Since it should be noted that it is never said
of those <span id="page_282">p. 282</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xii.vii-Page_282"></span>who are entangled in other sins that
they have God resisting them; I mean it is not said that God is opposed
“to the gluttonous, fornicators, passionate, or covetous,” but only “to
the proud.” For those sins react only on those who commit them, or seem
to be committed against those who share in them, i.e., against other
men; but this one has more properly to do with God, and therefore it is
especially right that it should have Him opposed to it.
