<span id="iv.vii.vi.xii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vii.vi.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.xii-p1"></span>He explains more fully what the
mystery is which is signified under the name of the man and wife.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.xii-p2.1"></span>What</span> then is that great mystery
which is signified under the name of the man and his wife? Let us ask
the Apostle himself, who elsewhere to teach the same thing uses words of
the same force, saying: “And evidently great is the mystery of
godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit,
seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
received up in glory.” <span id="fr_2530"></span>[2531](#fn_2530) What
then is that great mystery which was manifested in the flesh? Clearly it
was God born of the flesh, God seen in bodily form: who was openly
received up in glory just as He was openly manifested in the flesh. This
then is the great mystery, of which he says: “For this cause shall a man
leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they two
shall be one flesh.” Who then were the two in one flesh? God and the
soul, for in the one flesh of man which is joined to God are present God
and the soul, as the Lord Himself says: “No man can take My life (anima)
away from Me. But I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down,
and I have power to take it again.” <span
id="fr_2531"></span>[2532](#fn_2531) You see then in this, three; viz.,
God, the flesh, and the soul. He is God who speaks: the flesh in which
He speaks: the soul of which He speaks. Is He therefore that man of whom
the prophet says: “A brother cannot redeem, nor shall a man
redeem”? <span id="fr_2532"></span>[2533](#fn_2532) Who, as it was said,
“ascended up where He was before,” <span
id="fr_2533"></span>[2534](#fn_2533) and of whom we read: “No man hath
ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of
man who is in heaven.” <span id="fr_2534"></span>[2535](#fn_2534) For
this cause, I say, He has left his father and mother, i.e., God from
whom He was begotten and that “Jerusalem which is the mother of us
all,” <span id="fr_2535"></span>[2536](#fn_2535) and has cleaved to
human flesh, as to his wife. And therefore he expressly says in the case
of the father “a man shall leave *his* father,” but in the case of the
mother he does not say “his,” but simply says “mother:” because she was
not so much his mother, as the mother of all believers, i.e., of all of
us. And He was joined to his wife, for just as man and wife make but one
body, so the glory of Divinity and the flesh of man are united and the
two, viz., God and the soul, become one flesh. For just as that flesh
had God as an indweller in it, so also had it the soul within it
dwelling with God. This then is that great mystery, to search out which
our admiration for the Apostle summons us, and God’s own exhortation
bids us: and it is one not foreign to Christ and His Church, as he says,
“But I am speaking of Christ and the Church.” Because the flesh of the
Church is the flesh of Christ, and in the flesh of Christ there is
present God and the soul: and so the same person is present in Christ as
in the Church, because the mystery which we believe in the flesh of
Christ, is contained also by faith in the Church.
