<p> <a name="iv.iv.ii.vi"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.ii.vi-p0.1"></A>Chapter VI.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.ii.vi-p1"></A>Of those who in renouncing the world, aim at perfection without love.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.ii.vi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ii.vi-p2.1"></A>For</span> hence it arises that in the case of some who have despised the greatest possessions of this world, and not only large sums of gold and silver, but also large properties, we have seen them afterwards disturbed and excited over a knife, or pencil, or pin, or pen. Whereas if they kept their gaze steadily fixed out of a pure heart they would certainly never allow such a thing to happen for trifles, while in order that they might not suffer it in the case of great and precious riches they chose rather to renounce them altogether. For often too some guard their books so jealously that they will not allow them to be even slightly moved or touched by any one else, and from this fact they meet with occasions of impatience and death, which give them warning of the need of acquiring the requisite patience and love; and when they have given up all their wealth for the love of Christ, yet as they preserve their former disposition in the matter of trifles, and are sometimes quickly upset about them, they become in all points barren and unfruitful, as those who are without the charity of which the Apostle speaks: and this the blessed Apostle foresaw in spirit, and &#8220;though,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I give all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1089"></A><A HREF="#fn_1089"><FONT SIZE="1">1090</FONT></A>
 And from this it clearly follows that perfection is not arrived at simply by self-denial, and the giving up of all our goods, and the casting away of honours, unless there is that charity, the details of which the Apostle describes, which consists in purity of heart alone. For &#8220;not to be envious,&#8221; &#8220;not to be puffed up, not to be angry, not to do any wrong, not to seek one&#146;s own, not to rejoice in iniquity, not to think evil&#8221; etc., what is all this except ever to offer to God a perfect and clean heart, and to keep it free from all disturbances?</p>
