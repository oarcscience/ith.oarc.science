#### <span id="iv.vii.vi.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.xiii-p1"></span>Of the longing with which the old
patriarchs desired to see the revelation of that mystery.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.xiii-p2.1"></span>This</span> mystery then, which was
manifested in the flesh and appeared in the world, and was preached to
the Gentiles, many of the saints of old longed to see in the flesh, as
they foresaw it in the spirit. For “Verily,” saith the Lord, “I say unto
you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things
which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear the things which ye
hear and have not heard them.” <span
id="fr_2536"></span>[2537](#fn_2536) And so the prophet Isaiah says: “O
that Thou, Lord, would rend the heavens and come down,” <span
id="fr_2537"></span>[2538](#fn_2537) and David too: “O Lord, bow the
heavens and come down.” <span id="fr_2538"></span>[2539](#fn_2538) Moses
also says: “Show me Thyself that I may see Thee plainly.” <span
id="fr_2539"></span>[2540](#fn_2539) No one ever approached nearer to
God speaking out of the clouds, and to the very presence of His glory
than Moses who received the law. And if no one ever saw more closely
into God than he did, why did he ask for a still clearer vision, saying,
“Show me Thyself that I may see Thee plainly”? Simply because he prayed
that this <span id="page_590">p. 590</span> <span
id="iv.vii.vi.xiii-Page_590"></span>might happen which the apostle tells
us in almost the same words actually did happen; viz., that the Lord
might be openly manifested in the flesh, might openly appear to the
world, openly be received up in glory; and that at last the saints might
with their very bodily eyes see all those things which with spiritual
sight they had foreseen.

or a statue.](2111149)
