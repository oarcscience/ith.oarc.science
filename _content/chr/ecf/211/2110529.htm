<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xi.xviii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xi.xviii-p2.1"></A>Wherefore</span> this is an old maxim of the Fathers that is still current,&#8212;though I cannot produce it without shame on my own part, since I could not avoid my own sister, nor escape the hands of the bishop,&#8212;viz., that a monk ought by all means to fly from women and bishops. For neither of them will allow him who has once been joined in close intercourse any longer to care for the quiet of his cell, or to continue with pure eyes in divine contemplation through his insight into holy things.</p>
