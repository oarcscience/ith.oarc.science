#### <span id="iv.v.vi.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.v.vi.i-p1"></span>Discourse of Abbot Nesteros on the
threefold system of gifts.

<span id="iv.v.vi.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vi.i-p2.1"></span>After</span> evening service we sat down
together on the mats as usual ready for the promised narration: and when
we had kept silence for some little time out of reverence for the Elder,
he anticipated the silence of our respect by such words as these. The
previous order of our discourse had brought us to the exposition of the
system of spiritual gifts, which we have learnt from the tradition of
the Elders is a threefold one. The first indeed is for the sake of
healing, when the grace of signs accompanies certain elect and righteous
men on account of the merits of their holiness, as it is clear that the
apostles and many of the saints wrought signs and wonders in accordance
with the authority of the Lord Who says: “Heal the sick, raise the dead,
cleanse the lepers, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely
give.” <span id="fr_1937"></span>[1938](#fn_1937) The second when for
the edification of the church or on account of the faith of those who
bring their sick, or of those who are to be cured, the virtue of health
proceeds even from sinners and men unworthy of it. Of whom the Saviour
says in the gospel: “Many shall say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have
we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name cast out devils, and in
Thy name done many mighty works? And then I will confess to them, I
never knew you: Depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity.” <span
id="fr_1938"></span>[1939](#fn_1938) And on the other hand, if the faith
of those who bring them or of the sick is wanting, it prevents those on
whom the gifts of healing are conferred from exercising their powers of
healing. On which subject Luke the Evangelist says: “And Jesus could not
there do any mighty work because of their unbelief.” <span
id="fr_1939"></span>[1940](#fn_1939) Whence also the Lord Himself says:
“Many lepers were in Israel in the days of Elisha the prophet, and none
of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.” <span
id="fr_1940"></span>[1941](#fn_1940) The third method of healing is
copied by the deceit and contrivance of devils, that, when a man who is
enslaved to evident sins is out of admiration for his miracles regarded
as a saint and a servant of God, men may be persuaded <span
id="page_446">p. 446</span> <span id="iv.v.vi.i-Page_446"></span>to copy
his sins and thus an opening being made for cavilling, the sanctity of
religion may be brought into disgrace, or else that he, who believes
that he possesses the gift of healing, may be puffed up by pride of
heart and so fall more grievously. Hence it is that invoking the names
of those, who, as they know, have no merits of holiness or any spiritual
fruits, they pretend that by their merits they are disturbed and made to
flee from the bodies they have possessed. Of which it says in
Deuteronomy: “If there rise up in the midst of thee a prophet, or one
who says that he has seen a dream, and declare a sign and a wonder, and
that which he hath spoken cometh to pass, and he say to thee: Let us go
and follow after other gods whom thou knowest not, and let us serve
them: thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or of that dreamer,
for the Lord thy God is tempting thee that it may appear whether thou
lovest Him or not, with all thy heart and with all thy soul.” <span
id="fr_1941"></span>[1942](#fn_1941) And in the gospel it says: “There
shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall give great signs
and wonders, so that, if it were possible, even the elect should be led
astray.” <span id="fr_1942"></span>[1943](#fn_1942)
