<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.ix.xx-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ix.xx-p2.1"></A>Germanus</span>: Since a passage of Genesis was a little while ago by the providence of God brought forward in our midst, and happily reminded us that we can now conveniently ask about a point which we have always longed to learn, we want to know what view we ought to take about those fallen angels who are said to have had intercourse with the daughters of men, and whether such a thing can literally  <A NAME="page_383"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 383</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.ix.xx-Page_383"></A>take place with a spiritual nature. And also with regard to this passage of the gospel which you quoted of the devil a little while back, &#8220;for he is a liar and his father,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1549"></A><A HREF="#fn_1549"><FONT SIZE="1">1550</FONT></A>
 we should like in the same way to hear who is to be understood by &#8220;his father.&#8221;</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iv.ix.xx-p3"></A> S. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044">John viii. 44</a><a name="iv.iv.ix.xx-p3.1"></A>. We find from Augustin (Tract. xxiv. in Johan.) that the Manichees interpreted this text as implying that the devil had a father, translating it &#8220;For he is a liar, and so is his father.&#8221; Augustine himself explains it as Abbot Serenus does below in c. xxv.; viz., that the devil is not only a liar himself but the parent of lies.</p>
