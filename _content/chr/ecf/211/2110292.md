#### <span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p1"></span>Of the Sheepskin and the
Goatskin. <span id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656)

<span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i.vii-p3.1"></span>The</span> last article of their dress is
the goat-skin, which is called *melotes*, or *pera*, <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657) and a staff, which they carry in
imitation of those who foreshadowed the lines of the monastic life in
the Old Testament, of whom the Apostle says: “They wandered about in
sheepskins and goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted; of whom
the world was not worthy; wandering in deserts, and in mountains, and in
dens, and in caves of the earth.” <span
id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658) And this garment of goatskin signifies
that having destroyed all wantonness of carnal passions they ought to
continue in the utmost sobriety of virtue, and that nothing of the
wantonness or heat of youth, or of their old lightmindedness, should
remain in their bodies.

<span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p2"></span> The melotes (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p2.1"></span>μηλωτής</span>), a
sheepskin garment hanging down on one side, was the usual dress of
monks. S. Anthony bequeathed his, at his death, to S. Athanasius. Ath.
Vita Anton, 91.

<span id="iv.iii.i.vii-p4"></span> Pera can hardly be used here in its
ordinary sense of scrip or wallet <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.i.vii-p4.1"></span>πήρα</span>. Gazæus suggests that it may
be a transcriber’s error for pœnula, while Ducange would read, “quæ
melotes appellatur, vel pera, et baculus.” Mr. Sinker, in the
*Dictionary of Christian Antiquities* (Vol. II. p. 1619), suggests that
possibly the word may be Egyptian.
