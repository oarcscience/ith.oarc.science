#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXVII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxvii-p1"></span>How the devil always lies in wait
for our end, and how we ought continually to watch his head. <span
id="fr_805"></span>[806](#fn_805)

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxvii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxvii-p3.1"></span>For</span> the subtle serpent is ever
“watching our heel,” that is, is lying in wait for the close, and
endeavouring to trip us up right to the end of our life. And therefore
it will not be of any use to have made a good beginning and to have
eagerly taken the first step towards renouncing the world with all
fervour, if a corresponding end does not likewise set it off and
conclude it, and if the humility and poverty of Christ, of which you
have now made profession in His sight, are not preserved by you even to
the close of your life, as they were first secured. And that you may
succeed in doing this, do you ever “watch his head,” i.e. the first rise
of thoughts, by bringing them at once to your superior. For thus you
will learn to “bruise” his dangerous beginnings, if you are not ashamed
to disclose any of them to your superior.

id="iv.iii.iv.xxxvii-p2.1"></span>: “I will put enmity between thee and
the woman and between thy seed and her seed; it shalt bruise thy head
and thou shalt bruise his heel:” the last clause of which is rendered by
the LXX. <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxvii-p2.2"></span>αὐτός σου τηρήσει κεφαλήν καὶ συ
τηρήσεις αὐτοῦ πτέρναν</span>, where the Vulgate has “Ipsa conteret
caput tuum et tu insidiaberis calcaneo ejus.”
