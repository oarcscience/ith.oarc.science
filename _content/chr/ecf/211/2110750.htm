<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.ix.vi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.ix.vi-p2.1"></A>God</span> forbid that we should admit that God has created anything which is substantially evil, as Scripture says &#8220;everything that God had made was very good.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1525"></A><A HREF="#fn_1525"><FONT SIZE="1">1526</FONT></A>
 For if they were created by God such as they are now, or made for this purpose; viz., to occupy these positions of malice, and ever to be ready for the deception and ruin of men, we should in opposition to the view of the above quoted Scripture slander God as the Creator and author of evil, as having Himself formed utterly evil wills and natures, creating them for this very purpose; viz., that they might ever persist in their wickedness and never pass over to the feeling of a good will. The following reason then of this diversity is what we received from the tradition of the fathers, being drawn from the fount of Holy Scripture.</p>
