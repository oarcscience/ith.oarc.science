#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.viii-p1"></span>Of the Prayer which follows the
Psalm.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.viii-p2.1"></span>That</span> practice too which we have
observed in this country—viz., that while one sings to the end of the
Psalm, all standing up sing together with a loud voice, “Glory be to the
Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost”—we have never heard
anywhere throughout the East, but there, while all keep silence when the
Psalm is finished, the prayer that follows is offered up by the singer.
But with this hymn in honour of the Trinity only the whole
Psalmody <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694) is usually ended. <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695)

<span id="iv.iii.ii.viii-p3"></span> *Antiphona*. The word must
certainly be used here not in the later sense of “antiphon,” but as
descriptive of the whole of the Psalmody of the office. Cf. note on c.
i.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.viii-p4"></span> In the Eastern offices the Psalter
is divided into twenty sections called <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.viii-p4.1"></span>καθίσματα</span>, each of which is
subdivided into three <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.viii-p4.2"></span>στάσεις</span>, at the close of each of
which the Gloria is said, and not, as in the West, after every Psalm.
This Western custom which Cassian here notices seems to have originated
in Gaul, and thence spread to other churches as, according to Walafrid
Strabo, at Rome it was used but rarely after the Psalms in the ninth
century. See Walafrid Strabo, c. xxv. ap. Hittorp. 688. The earliest
certain indications of the use of the hymn itself are found in the
fourth century. See S. Basil *De Spiritu Sancto*, c. xxix.; Theodoret,
*Eccl. Hist*., II. xxiv., Sozomen, *Eccl. Hist*., III. xx. The Greek
form is <span class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.ii.viii-p4.3"></span>Δὁξα
πατρὶ καὶ ὑἱῷ καὶ ἁγίῳ πνευμάτι καὶ νῦν καὶ ἀεὶ καὶ ἐις τοὺς ἀιῶνας τῶν
ἀιωνῶν, ἀμήν</span>. The additional words in use in the West, “sicut
erat in principio,” were first adopted in the sixth century, being
ordered by the Council of Vaison, <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.viii-p4.4"></span>a.d.</span> 529, “after the example of
the apostolic see.”
