#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xv-p1"></span>Of the discreet rule by which every
one must retire to his cell after the close of the prayers; and <span
id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707) of the rebuke to which any one who
does otherwise is subject.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xv-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.xv-p3.1"></span>And</span> so, when the Psalms are
finished, and the daily assembly, as we said above, is broken up, none
of them dares to loiter ever so little or to gossip with another: nor
does he presume even to leave his cell throughout the whole day, or to
forsake the work which he is wont to carry on in it, except when they
happen to be called out for the performance of some necessary duty,
which they fulfil by going out of doors so that there may not be any
chattering at all among them. But every one does the work assigned to
him in such a way that, by repeating by heart some Psalm or passage of
Scripture, he gives no opportunity or time for dangerous schemes or evil
designs, or even for idle talk, as both mouth and heart are incessantly
taken up with spiritual meditations. For they are most particular in
observing this rule, that none of them, and especially of the younger
ones, may be caught stopping even for a moment or going anywhere
together with another, or holding his hands in his. But, if they
discover any who in defiance of the discipline of this rule have
perpetrated any of these forbidden things, they pronounce them guilty of
no slight fault, as contumacious and disobedient to the rules; nor are
they free from suspicion of plotting and nefarious designs. And, unless
they expiate their fault by public penance when all the brethren are
gathered together, none of them is allowed to be present at the prayers
of the brethren.
