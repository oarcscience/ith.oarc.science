#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xi-p1"></span>An objection whether unclean spirits
can be present in or united with the souls of those whom they have
filled.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xi-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: To this idea we think
that what we see happen in the case of those possessed is sufficiently
opposed, when they say and do what they know not under the influence of
the spirits. How then are we to refuse to believe that their souls are
not united to those spirits, when we see them made their instruments,
and (forsaking their natural condition) yielding to their movements and
moods, in such a way that they give expression no longer to their own
words and actions and wishes, but to those of the demons?
