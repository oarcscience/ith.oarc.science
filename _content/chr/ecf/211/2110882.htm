<p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vi.ii-p1"></A>Wherein one ought to admire the saints.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vi.ii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vi.ii-p2.1"></A>Wherefore</span> we never ought to admire those who affect these things, for these powers, but rather to look whether they are perfect in driving out all sins, and amending their ways, for this is granted to each man not for the faith of some other, or for a variety of reasons, but for his own earnestness, by the action of God&#146;s grace. For this is practical knowledge which is termed by another name by the Apostle; viz., love, and is by the authority of the Apostle preferred to all tongues of men and of angels, and to full assurance of faith which can even remove mountains, and to all knowledge, and prophecy, and to the distribution of all one&#146;s goods, and finally to the glory of martyrdom itself. For when he had enumerated all kinds of gifts and had said: &#8220;To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge, to another faith, to another the gift of healing, to another the working of miracles, etc.:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1943"></A><A HREF="#fn_1943"><FONT SIZE="1">1944</FONT></A>
 when he was going to speak about love notice how in a few words he put it before all gifts: &#8220;And yet,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I show unto you a still more excellent way.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1944"></A><A HREF="#fn_1944"><FONT SIZE="1">1945</FONT></A>
 By which it is clearly shown that the height of perfection and blessedness does not consist in the performance of those wonderful works but in the purity of love. And this not without good reason. For all those things are to pass away and be destroyed, but love is to abide for ever. And so we have never found that those works and signs were affected by our fathers: nay, rather when they did possess them by the grace of the Holy Spirit they would never use them, unless perhaps extreme and unavoidable necessity drove them to do so.</p>
