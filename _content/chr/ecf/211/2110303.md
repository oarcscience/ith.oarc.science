#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.vi-p1"></span>Of the Custom of having Twelve
Prayers.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.vi-p2.1"></span>Whereupon</span> the venerable assembly of
the Fathers understood that by Divine Providence a general rule had been
fixed for the congregations of the brethren through the angel’s
direction, and so decreed that this number should be preserved both in
their evening and in their nocturnal services; and when they added to
these two lessons, one from the Old and one from the New Testament, they
added them simply as extras and of their own appointment, only for those
who liked, and who were eager to gain by constant study a mind well
stored with Holy Scripture. But on Saturday and Sunday they read them
both from the New Testament; viz., one from the Epistles <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689) or the Acts of the Apostles, and one
from the Gospel. <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690) And this also
those do whose concern is the reading and the recollection of the
Scriptures, from Easter to Whitsuntide. <span

<span id="iv.iii.ii.vi-p3"></span> *Apostolus*, the regular name for the
book of the Epistles.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.vi-p5"></span> *Totis Quinquagessimœ diebus*; i.e.,
the whole period of fifty days between Easter and Whitsuntide (cf. c.
xviii. and the Conferences XXI. viii., xi., xx.). This is the usual
meaning of the term Pentecost in early writers, though it is also used
more strictly for the actual festival of Whitsunday. Cf. the Twentieth
Canon of the Council of Nicæa, and see Canon Bright’s *Notes on the
Canons*, p. 72, for other instances.
