<span id="iv.vi.v.xx-p1"></span>The answer.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xx-p2.1"></span>Your</span> pertinent question deserves to
be told the perfect true reason. After the Ascension of our Saviour
which took place on the fortieth day after His Resurrection, the
apostles returned from the Mount of Olives, on which He had suffered
them to see Him when He was returning to the Father, as the book of the
Acts of the Apostles also testifies, and entered Jerusalem and are said
to have waited ten days for the coming of the Holy Ghost, and when these
were fulfilled on the fiftieth day they received Him with joy. And thus
in this way the number of this festival was clearly made up, which as we
read was figuratively foreshadowed also in the Old Testament, where when
seven weeks were fulfilled the bread of the firstfruits was ordered to
be offered by the priests to the Lord: <span
id="fr_2192"></span>[2193](#fn_2192) and this was indeed shown to be
offered to the Lord by the preaching of the Apostles which they are said
on that day to have addressed to the people; the true bread of the
firstfruits, which when produced from the instruction of a new doctrine,
consecrated the firstfruits of the Jews as a Christian people to the
Lord, five thousand men being filled with the gifts of the food. And
therefore these ten days are to be kept with equal solemnity and joy as
the previous forty. And the tradition about this festival, transmitted
to us by Apostolic men, should be kept with the same uniformity. For
therefore on those days they do not bow their knees in prayer, because
the bending of the knees is a sign of penitence and mourning. Wherefore
also during these days we observe in all things the same solemnities as
on Sunday, on which day our predecessors taught that men ought not to
fast nor to bow the knee, out of reverence for the Lord’s Resurrection.
