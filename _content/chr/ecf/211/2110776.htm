<p> <a name="iv.iv.x.vi"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.x.vi-p0.1"></A>Chapter VI.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.x.vi-p1"></A>Of the vision which a certain Elder saw concerning the restless work of a brother.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.x.vi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.x.vi-p2.1"></A>And</span> that this is not done without the prompting of devils we are taught by the surest proofs, for when one very highly esteemed Elder was passing by the cell of a certain brother who was suffering from this mental disease of which we have spoken, as he was restlessly toiling in his daily occupations in building and repairing what was unnecessary, he watched him from a distance breaking a very hard stone with a heavy hammer, and saw a certain Ethiopian standing over him and together with him striking the blows of the hammer with joined and clasped hands, and urging him on with fiery incitements to diligence in the work: and so he stood still for a long while in astonishment at the force of the fierce demon and the deceitfulness of such an illusion. For when the brother was worn out and tired and wanted to rest and put an end to his toil, he was stimulated by the spirit&#146;s prompting and urged on to resume his hammer again and not to cease from devoting himself to the work which he had begun, so that being unweariedly supported by his incitements he did not feel the harm that so great labour was doing him. At last then the old man, disgusted at such a horrid mystification by a demon, turned aside to the brother&#146;s cell and saluted him, and asked &#8220;what work is it, brother, that you are doing?&#8221; and he replied: &#8220;We are working at this awfully hard stone, and we can hardly break it at all.&#8221; Whereupon the Elder replied: &#8220;You were right in saying &#145;<i>we</i> can,&#146; for you were not alone, when you were striking it, but there was another with you whom you did not see, who was standing over you not so much to help you as urge you on with all his force.&#8221; And thus the fact that the disease of worldly vanity has not got hold of our hearts, will be proved by no mere abstinence from those affairs which even if we want to engage in, we cannot carry out, nor by the despising of those matters which if we pursued them would make us remarkable in the front rank among spiritual persons as well as among worldly men, but only when we reject with inflexible firmness of mind whatever ministers to our power and seems to be veiled in a show of right. And in reality these things which seem trivial  <A NAME="page_390"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 390</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.x.vi-Page_390"></A>and of no consequence, and which we see to be permitted indifferently by those who belong to our calling, none the less by their character affect the soul than those more important things, which according to their condition usually intoxicate the senses of worldly people and which do not allow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1590"></A><A HREF="#fn_1590"><FONT SIZE="1">1591</FONT></A>
 a monk to lay aside earthly impurities and aspire to God, on whom his attention should ever be fixed; for in his case even a slight separation from that highest good must be regarded as present death and most dangerous destruction. And when the soul has been established in such a peaceful condition, and has been freed from the meshes of all carnal desires, and the purpose of the heart has been steadily fixed on that which is the only highest good, he will then fulfil this Apostolic precept: &#8220;Pray without ceasing;&#8221; and: &#8220;in every place lifting up holy hands without wrath and disputing:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1591"></A><A HREF="#fn_1591"><FONT SIZE="1">1592</FONT></A>
 for when by this purity (if we can say so) the thoughts of the soul are engrossed, and are re-fashioned out of their earthly condition to bear a spiritual and angelic likeness, whatever it receives, whatever it takes in hand, whatever it does, the prayer will be perfectly pure and sincere.</p>
