#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p1"></span>Of the system of the Anchorites and its
beginning.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p2.1"></span>Out</span> of this number of the perfect,
and, if I may use the expression, this most fruitful root of saints,
were produced afterwards the flowers and fruits of the anchorites as
well. And of this order we have heard that the originators were those
whom we mentioned just now; viz., Saint Paul <span
id="fr_2076"></span>[2077](#fn_2076) and Antony, men who frequented the
recesses of the desert, not as some from faintheartedness, and the evil
of impatience, but from a desire for loftier heights of perfection and
divine contemplation, although the former of them is said to have found
his way to the desert by reason of necessity, while during the time of
persecution he was avoiding the plots of his neighbours. So then there
sprang from that system of which we have spoken another sort of
perfection, whose followers are rightly termed anchorites; i.e.,
withdrawers, because, being by no means satisfied with that victory
whereby they had trodden under foot the hidden snares of the devil,
while still living among men, they were eager to fight with the devils
in open conflict, and a straightforward battle, and so feared not to
penetrate the vast recesses of the desert, imitating, to wit, John the
Baptist, who passed all his life in the desert, and Elijah and Elisha
and those of whom the Apostle speaks as follows: “They wandered about in
sheepskins and goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted, of whom
the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts, in mountains and in dens
and in caves of the earth.” Of whom too the Lord speaks figuratively to
Job: “But who hath sent out the wild ass free, and who hath loosed his
bands? To whom I have given the wilderness for an house, and a barren
land for his dwelling. He scorneth the multitude of the city and heareth
not the cry of the driver; he looketh round about the mountains of his
pasture, and seeketh for every green thing.” In the Psalms also: “Let
now the redeemed of the Lord say, those whom He hath redeemed from the
hand of the enemy;” and after a little: “They wandered in a wilderness
in a place without water: they found not the way of a city of
habitation. They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.
And they cried unto the Lord in their trouble and He delivered them out
of their distress;” whom Jeremiah too describes as follows: “Blessed is
the man that hath borne the yoke from his youth. He shall sit solitary
and hold his peace because he hath taken it up upon himself,” and there
sing in heart and deed these words of the Psalmist: <span
id="page_482">p. 482</span> <span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-Page_482"></span>“I am
become like a pelican in the wilderness. I watched and am become like a
sparrow alone upon the house-top.” <span

<span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p3"></span> Paul was from very early days
celebrated as the first of the anchorites. Indeed S. Jerome, who wrote
his life (Works, Vol. ii. p. 13 ed. Migne) calls him “auctor vitæ
monasticæ” (Ep. xxii.<span id="iv.vi.ii.vi-p3.1"></span> ad Eustochium).
He is said to have fled to the Thebaid from the terrors of the Decian
persecution, and to have died there in extreme old age. Antony has
already been several times mentioned by Cassian. See the Institutes V.
iv.: Conference II. ii.; III. iv., etc.
