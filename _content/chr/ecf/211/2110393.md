#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xx-p1"></span>How a monk should not overstep the
proper hours for taking food, if he wants to proceed to the struggle of
interior conflicts.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xx-p2"></span>A <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xx-p2.1"></span>monk</span> therefore who wants to proceed
to the struggle of interior conflicts should lay down this as a
precaution for himself to begin with: viz.: that he will not in any case
allow himself to be overcome by any delicacies, or take anything to eat
or drink before the fast <span id="fr_858"></span>[859](#fn_858) is over
and the proper hour for refreshment has come, outside meal times; <span
id="fr_859"></span>[860](#fn_859) nor, when the meal is over, will he
allow himself to take a morsel however small; and likewise that he will
observe the canonical time and measure of sleep. For that
self-indulgence must be cut off in the same way that the sin of
unchastity has to be rooted out. For if a man is unable to check the
unnecessary desires of the appetite how will he be able to extinguish
the fire of carnal lust? And if a man is not able to control passions,
which are openly manifest and are but small, how will he be able with
temperate discretion to fight against those which are secret, and excite
him, when none are there to see? And therefore strength of mind is
tested in separate impulses and in any sort of passion: and if it is
overcome in the case of very small and manifest desires, how it will
endure in those that are really great and powerful and hidden, each
man’s conscience must witness for himself.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xx-p3"></span> *Statio*. This is properly the term
for the weekly fasts on Wednesday and Friday, observed by the early
Church in memory of our Lord’s betrayal and crucifixion. See Tertullian
on Prayer c. xix.; on Fasting c. i. x. In this place the word appears to
be used by Cassian for the close of the fast; while elsewhere he uses it
for fasting generally (not specially on Wednesday and Friday,) as in c.
xxiv. of the present book, and in the Conferences, II. xxv.; XXI. xxi.
The origin of the word is somewhat uncertain (a) because the fast was
observed on stated days (*stasis diebus*); or (b), as S. Ambrose
suggests, because “our fasts are our encampments which protect us from
the devil’s attacks: in short, they are called *stationes*, because
standing (*stantes*) and staying in them we repel our plotting foe”
(Serm. 25). See Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, vol. ii. p. 1928.
