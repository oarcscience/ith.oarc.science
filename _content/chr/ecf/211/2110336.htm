And when he has served there for a whole year without any complaint, and has given evidence of service towards strangers,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_760"></A><A HREF="#fn_760"><FONT SIZE="1">761</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.iv.vii-p3"></A> In the same way the Rule of S. Benedict (c. lviii.) directs that the novice is to be placed in the guest house for a few days, while that of S. Isidore is more precise in ordering him to be placed there &#8220;for three months,&#8221; and to wait on the guests there. Two months is the period fixed by other rules, but a few days was all that was ultimately required, and Cassian stands alone in mentioning a full year as the duration of this service, though Sozomen speaks of the monks of Tabenna as having to undergo a probation of three years. H. E., III. xiv.</p>

The office of &#8220;Dean&#8221; (Decanus) which is here spoken of by Cassian, is also referred to by Augustine (<i>De Mor. Eccl</i>. xxxi.) and Jerome (<i>Ep</i>. xxii. <i>ad Eustoch</i>.), and recognized by the Rule of S. Benedict, c. xxi., where directions for his appointment are given.</p>
