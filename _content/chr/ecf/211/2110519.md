#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.viii-p1"></span>How vainglory is not allayed either
in the desert or through advancing years.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.viii-p2.1"></span>Other</span> vices, as we said, are
sometimes allayed by the advantages of position, and when the matter of
the sin and the occasion and opportunity for it are removed, grow slack,
and are diminished: but this one penetrates the deserts with the man who
is flying from it, nor can it be shut out from any place, nor when
outward material for it is removed does it fail. For it is simply
encouraged by the achievements of the virtues of the man whom it
attacks. For all other vices, as we said above, are sometimes diminished
by the lapse of time, and disappear: to this one length of life, unless
it is supported by skilful diligence and prudent discretion, is no
hindrance, but actually supplies it with new fuel for vanity.

mixed up with virtues.](2110520)
