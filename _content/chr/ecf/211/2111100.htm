<p> <a name="iv.vii.iii.iv"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vii.iii.iv-p0.1"></A>Chapter IV.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.iii.iv-p1"></A>He produces testimonies to the same doctrine from the Apostle Paul.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.iii.iv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.iii.iv-p2.1"></A>But</span> passing over these things which cannot possibly be unfolded because there would be no limit to the telling of them, as the blessings which he gives are without stint, it is time for us to consult the Apostle Paul, the stoutest and clearest witness to Him, for he can tell us everything about God in the most trustworthy way because God always spoke from his breast. He then, the chosen teacher of the nations, who was sent to destroy the errors of Gentile superstition, bears his witness in the following way to the grace and coming of our Lord God: &#8220;The grace,&#8221; he says, &#8220;of God and our Saviour appeared unto all men, instructing us that denying ungodliness and worldly desires we should live soberly and justly and godly in this world, looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2403"></A><A HREF="#fn_2403"><FONT SIZE="1">2404</FONT></A>
 He says that &#8220;there appeared the grace of God our Saviour.&#8221; Admirably does he use a word suited to show the arrival of a new grace and birth; for by saying &#8220;there <i>appeared</i>,&#8221; he indicated the approach of a new grace and birth, for thenceforward the gift of a new grace began to appear, from the moment when God appeared as born in the world. Thus by using the right word, and one exactly suitable, he shows the light of this new grace almost as if he pointed to it with his finger. For that is most properly said to <i>appear</i>, which is shown by sudden light manifesting it. Just as we read in the gospel that the star <i>appeared</i> to the wise men in the East:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2404"></A><A HREF="#fn_2404"><FONT SIZE="1">2405</FONT></A>
 and in Exodus: &#8220;There <i>appeared</i>,&#8221; he says, &#8220;to Moses an angel in a flame of fire in the bush:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2405"></A><A HREF="#fn_2405"><FONT SIZE="1">2406</FONT></A>
 for in all these and in the case of other visions in the Holy Scripture, Scripture determined that this word in particular should be used, that it might speak of that as &#8220;appearing,&#8221; which shone forth with unwonted light. So then the Apostle also, well knowing the coming of the heavenly grace, which appeared at the approach of the holy nativity, indicated it by using a term applied to a bright appearance; expressly in order to say that it <i>appeared</i>, as it shone with the splendour of a new light. &#8220;There appeared&#8221; then &#8220;the grace of God our Saviour.&#8221; Surely you cannot raise any quibble about the ambiguity of the names in this place, so as to say that &#8220;Christ&#8221; is one and &#8220;God&#8221; another, or to divide &#8220;the Saviour&#8221; from the glory of His name, and separate &#8220;the Lord&#8221; from the Divinity? Lo, here the vessel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2406"></A><A HREF="#fn_2406"><FONT SIZE="1">2407</FONT></A>
 of God speaks from God, and testifies by the clearest statement that the grace of God appeared from Mary. And in order that you may not deny that God appeared from Mary, he at once adds the name of Saviour, on purpose that you may believe that He who is born of Mary is God, whom you cannot deny to have been born a Saviour, in accordance with this passage: &#8220;For to you is born to-day a Saviour.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2407"></A><A HREF="#fn_2407"><FONT SIZE="1">2408</FONT></A>
 O excellent teacher of the Gentiles truly given by God to them, for he knew that this wild heretical folly would arise, which would turn to controversial uses the names of God, and would not hesitate to slander God from His own titles; and so just in order that the heretic might not separate the title of Saviour from the Divinity he put first the name of God, that the name of God standing first might claim as His all the names which followed, and that no one might imagine that in what followed Christ was spoken of as a mere man, as by the very first word used he had  <A NAME="page_560"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 560</FONT></A> <a name="iv.vii.iii.iv-Page_560"></A>taught that He was God. &#8220;Looking,&#8221; says the same Apostle, &#8220;for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.&#8221; Certainly that teacher of divine wisdom saw that plain and simple teaching would not in itself be sufficient to meet the crafty wiles of the devil&#146;s cunning, unless he fortified the holy preaching of the faith with a protection of extreme care. And so although he had used the name of God the Saviour up above, he here adds &#8220;Jesus Christ,&#8221; in case you might think that the mere name of Saviour was not enough to indicate to you our Lord Jesus Christ, and might fail to understand that the God, whom you acknowledge as God the Saviour, is the same Jesus Christ. What then does he say? He says: &#8220;Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.&#8221; Nothing is here wanting as regards the titles of our Lord and you see here God, and the Saviour, and Jesus, and Christ. But when you see all these, you see that they all belong to God. For you have heard of Him as God, but as Saviour as well. You have heard of Him as God, but as Jesus as well. You have heard of Him as God, but as Christ as well. That which the Divinity has joined and united together cannot be separated by this diversity of titles; for whichever you may seek for of them, all, you will find it there. The Saviour is God, Jesus is God, Christ is God. In all of this which you hear, though the titles used are many, yet they belong to one Person in power. For whereas the Saviour is God, and Jesus is God, and Christ is God, it is easy to see that all these, though different appellations, are united as regards the Majesty. And when you hear quite plainly that one and the same Person is called God in each case, you can surely clearly see that in all these cases there is but one God spoken of. And so you cannot any longer seek to make out a distinction of power from the different names given to the Lord, or to make a difference of Person owing to variety of titles. You cannot say: Christ was born of Mary, but God was not; for an Apostle declares that God was. You cannot say that Jesus was born of Mary, but God was not; for an Apostle testifies that God was. You cannot say: the Saviour was born, but God was not; for an Apostle supports the fact that God was. There is no way of escape for you. Whichever of the titles of the Lord you may take, He is God, of whom you speak. You have nothing to say: nothing to assert: nothing to invent in your wicked falsehood. You can in impious unbelief refuse to believe: you have nothing to deny in the matter of your blasphemy.</p>
