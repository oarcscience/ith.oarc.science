<span id="iv.vii.viii.i"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.i-p1"></span>As he is going to reply to the
slanders of his opponents he implores the aid of Divine grace to teach a
prayer to be used by those who undertake to dispute with heretics.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.i-p2.1"></span>As</span> it happens to those who having
escaped the perils of the sea, are in terror of the sands that stretch
before the harbour, or the rocks that line the shore, so it is in my
case that,—as I have kept to the last some of the slanders of the
heretics,—although I have reached the limit of the work which I set
myself, yet I am beginning to dread the close, which I had longed to
reach. But, as the Prophet says, “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear
what man can do to me,” <span id="fr_2593"></span>[2594](#fn_2593) so we
will not fear the pitfalls which crafty heretics have dug in front of
us, nor the paths thickly strewn with horrid thorns. For as they make
our road difficult but do not close it, there is before us the <span
id="page_604">p. 604</span> <span
id="iv.vii.viii.i-Page_604"></span>trouble of clearing them away, rather
than the fear of not being able to do so. For when, as we are walking
feebly along the right road, they come in our way, and frighten the
walkers rather than hurt them, our work and business has more to do in
clearing them away, than to fear from the difficulty of this: And so,
laying our hands upon that monstrous head of the deadly serpent, and
longing to lay hold of all the limbs that are entangled in the huge
folds and coils of his body, again and again do we pray to Thee, O Lord
Jesus, to whom we have ever prayed, that Thou wouldst give us words by
opening our mouth “to the pulling down of strongholds, destroying
counsels, and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of
God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto Thine
obedience:” <span id="fr_2594"></span>[2595](#fn_2594) for he is indeed
free, who has begun to be led captive by Thee. Do Thou then be present
to this work of thine, and to those of Thine who are striving for Thee
above the measure of their strength. Grant us to bruise the gaping
mouths of this new serpent, and its neck that swells with deadly poison,
O Thou who makest the feet of believers to tread unharmed on serpents
and scorpions, and to go upon the adder and basilisk, to tread under
foot the lion and the dragon. <span id="fr_2595"></span>[2596](#fn_2595)
And grant that through the fearless boldness of steadfast innocence, the
sucking child may play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child
thrust his hand into the den of the basilisk. <span
id="fr_2596"></span>[2597](#fn_2596) Grant then to us also that we may
thrust our hands unharmed into the den of this monstrous and most wicked
basilisk; and if it has in any holes, i.e., in the human heart, a
lurking or resting place, or has laid its eggs there, or left a trace of
its slimy course, do Thou remove from them all the foul and deadly
pollution of this most noxious serpent. Take away the uncleanness their
blasphemy has brought on them, and purify with the fan of Thy sacred
cleansing <span id="fr_2597"></span>[2598](#fn_2597) the souls that are
plunged in stinking mud, so that the “dens of thieves” may become
“houses of prayer:” <span id="fr_2598"></span>[2599](#fn_2598) and that
in those which are now, as is written, the dwellings where hedgehogs and
monsters, <span id="fr_2599"></span>[2600](#fn_2599) and satyrs, and all
kinds of strange creatures dwell, there the gifts of Thy Holy Spirit,
namely the beauty of faith and holiness may shine forth. And as once
Thou didst destroy idolatry and cast out images, and make shrines of
virtue out of the temples of devils, and let into the dens of serpents
and scorpions the rays of shining light, and make out of the dens of
error and shame the homes of beauty and splendour, so do Thou pour upon
all whose eyes the darkness of heretical obstinacy has blinded, the
light of Thy compassion and truth, that they may at length with clear
and unveiled sight behold the great and life-giving mystery of Thine
Incarnation, and so come to know Thee to have been born as Very man of
that sacred womb of a pure Virgin, and yet to acknowledge that Thou wast
always Very God.
