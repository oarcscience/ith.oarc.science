#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xiii-p1"></span>That we cannot enter the battle of
the inner man unless we have been set free from the vice of gluttony.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xiii-p2.1"></span>We</span> also ought first to give
evidence of our freedom from subjection to the flesh. For “of whom a man
is overcome, of the same is he the slave.” <span
id="fr_835"></span>[836](#fn_835) And “every one that doeth sin is the
slave of sin.” <span id="fr_836"></span>[837](#fn_836) And when the
scrutiny of the president of the contest finds that we are stained by no
infamy of disgraceful lust, and when we are judged by him not to be
slaves of the flesh, and ignoble and unworthy of the Olympic struggle
against our vices, then we shall be able to enter the lists against our
equals, that is the lusts of the flesh and the motions and disturbances
of the soul. For it is impossible for a full belly to make trial of the
combat of the inner man: nor is he worthy to be tried in harder battles,
who can be overcome in a slight skirmish.
