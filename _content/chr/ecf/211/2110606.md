#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p1"></span>Of the call of the Apostle Paul.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xv-p2.1"></span>And</span> when Christ in His own Person
called and addressed Paul, although He might have opened out to him at
once the way of perfection, yet He chose rather to direct him to Ananias
and commanded him to learn the way of truth from him, saying: “Arise and
go into the city and there it shall be told thee what thou oughtest to
do.” <span id="fr_1192"></span>[1193](#fn_1192) So He sends him to an
older man, and thinks good to have him instructed by his teaching rather
than His own, lest what might have been rightly done in the case of Paul
might set a bad example of self-sufficiency, if each one were to
persuade himself that he also ought in like manner to be trained by the
government and teaching of God alone rather than by the instruction of
the Elders. And this self-sufficiency the apostle himself teaches, not
only by his letters but by his acts and deeds, ought to be shunned with
all possible care, as he says that he went up to Jerusalem solely for
this reason; viz., to communicate in a private and informal conference
with his co-apostles and those who were before him that Gospel which he
preached to the Gentiles, the grace of the Holy Spirit accompanying him
with powerful signs and wonders: as he says “And I communicated with
them the Gospel which I preach among the Gentiles lest perhaps I had run
or should run in vain.” <span id="fr_1193"></span>[1194](#fn_1193) Who
then is so self-sufficient and blind as to dare to trust in his own
judgment and discretion when the chosen vessel confesses that he had
need of conference with his fellow apostles. Whence we clearly see that
the Lord does not Himself show the way of perfection to anyone who
having the opportunity of learning depises the teaching and training of
the Elders, paying no heed to that saying which ought most carefully to
be observed: “Ask thy father and he will show it to thee: thine Elders
and they will tell thee.” <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1195](#fn_1194)
