#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xix-p1"></span>Of those who fast out of rage.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xix-p2.1"></span>There</span> is too another evil sort of
vexation which would not be worth mentioning were it not that we know it
is allowed by some of the brethren who, when they have been vexed or
enraged actually abstain persistently from food, so that (a thing which
we cannot mention without shame) those who when they are calm declare
that they cannot possibly put off their refreshment to the sixth or at
most the ninth hour, when they are filled with vexation and rage do not
feel fasts even for two days, and support themselves, when exhausted by
such abstinence, by a surfeit of anger. Wherein they are plainly guilty
of the sin of sacrilege, as out of the devil’s own rage they endure
fasts which ought specially to be offered to God alone out of desire for
humiliation of heart and purification from sin: which is much the same
as if they were to offer prayers and sacrifices not to God but to
devils, and so be worthy of hearing this rebuke of Moses: “They
sacrificed to devils and not to God; to gods whom they knew not.” <span
