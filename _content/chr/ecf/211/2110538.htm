<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xii.vii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xii.vii-p2.1"></A>How</span> great is the evil of pride, that it rightly has no angel, nor other virtues opposed to it, but God Himself as its adversary! Since it should be noted that it is never said of those  <A NAME="page_282"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 282</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.xii.vii-Page_282"></A>who are entangled in other sins that they have God resisting them; I mean it is not said that God is opposed &#8220;to the gluttonous, fornicators, passionate, or covetous,&#8221; but only &#8220;to the proud.&#8221; For those sins react only on those who commit them, or seem to be committed against those who share in them, i.e., against other men; but this one has more properly to do with God, and therefore it is especially right that it should have Him opposed to it.</p>
