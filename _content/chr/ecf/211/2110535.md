#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.iv-p1"></span>How by reason of pride Lucifer was
turned from an archangel into a devil.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.iv-p2.1"></span>And</span> that we may understand the
power of its awful tyranny we see that that angel who, for the greatness
of his splendour and beauty was termed Lucifer, was cast out of heaven
for no other sin but this, and, pierced with the dart of pride, was
hurled down from his grand and exalted position as an angel into hell.
If then pride of heart alone was enough to cast down from heaven to
earth a power that was so great and adorned with the attributes of such
might, the very greatness of his fall shows us with what care we who are
surrounded by the weakness of the flesh ought to be on our guard. But we
can learn how to avoid the most deadly poison of this evil if we trace
out the origin and causes of his fall. For weakness can never be cured,
nor the remedies for bad states of health be disclosed <span
id="page_281">p. 281</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xii.iv-Page_281"></span>unless first their origin and causes
are investigated by a wise scrutiny. For as he (viz., Lucifer) was
endowed with divine splendour, and shone forth among the other higher
powers by the bounty of his Maker, he believed that he had acquired the
splendour of that wisdom and the beauty of those powers, with which he
was graced by the gift of the Creator, by the might of his own nature,
and not by the beneficence of His generosity. And on this account he was
puffed up as if he stood in no need of divine assistance in order to
continue in this state of purity, and esteemed himself to be like God,
as if, like God, he had no need of any one, and trusting in the power of
his own will, fancied that through it he could richly supply himself
with everything which was necessary for the consummation of virtue or
for the perpetuation of perfect bliss. This thought alone was the cause
of his first fall. On account of which being forsaken by God, whom he
fancied he no longer needed, he suddenly became unstable and tottering,
and discovered the weakness of his own nature, and lost the blessedness
which he had enjoyed by God’s gift. And because he “loved the words of
ruin,” with which he had said, “I will ascend into heaven,” and the
“deceitful tongue,” with which he had said of himself, “I will be like
the Most High,” <span id="fr_1017"></span>[1018](#fn_1017) and of Adam
and Eve, “Ye shall be as gods,” therefore “shall God destroy him forever
and pluck him out and remove him from his dwelling place and his root
out of the land of the living.” Then “the just,” when they see his ruin,
“shall fear, and shall laugh at him and say” (what may also be most
justly aimed at those who trust that they can obtain the highest good
without the protection and assistance of God): “Behold the man that made
not God his helper, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and
prevailed in his vanity.” <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1019](#fn_1018)
