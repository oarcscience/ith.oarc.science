#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.iv-p1"></span>Of the double sense in which Holy
Scripture may be taken.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.iv-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> on those passages which
are brought forward with a clear explanation we also can constantly lay
down the meaning and boldly state our own opinions. But those which the
Holy Spirit, reserving for our meditation and exercise, has inserted in
holy Scripture with veiled meaning, wishing some of them to be gathered
from various proofs and conjectures, ought to be step by step and
carefully brought together, so that their assertions and proofs may be
arranged by the discretion of the man who is arguing or supporting them.
For sometimes when a difference of opinion is expressed on one and the
same subject, either view may be considered reasonable and be held
without injury to the faith either firmly, or doubtfully, i.e., in such
a way that neither is full belief nor absolute rejection accorded to it,
and the second view need not interfere with the former, if neither of
them is found to be opposed to the faith: as in this case: where Elias
came in the person of John, <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1524](#fn_1523)
and is again to be the precursor of the Lord’s Advent: and in the matter
of the “Abomination of desolation” which “stood in the holy place,” by
means of that idol of Jupiter which, as we read, was placed in the
temple in Jerusalem, and which is again to stand in the Church through
the coming of Antichrist, <span id="fr_1524"></span>[1525](#fn_1524) and
all those things which follow in the gospel, which we take as having
been fulfilled before the captivity of Jerusalem and still to be
fulfilled at the end of this world. In which matters neither view is
opposed to the other, nor does the first interpretation interfere with
the second.
