#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxii-p1"></span>The charge which the same Abbot
Pinufius gave to a brother whom he admitted into his monastery in our
presence.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxii-p2.1"></span>This</span> old man, then, we
afterwards diligently sought out in Egypt because we had been intimate
with him in our own monastery; and I propose to insert in this work of
mine an exhortation which he gave in our presence to a brother whom he
admitted into the monastery, because I think that it may be useful. You
know, said he, that after lying for so many days at the entrance you are
to-day to be admitted. And to begin with you ought to know the reason of
the difficulty put in your way. For it may be of great service to you in
this road on which you are desirous to enter, if you understand the
method of it and approach the service of Christ accordingly, and as you
ought.

[Next: Chapter XXXIII. How it is that, just as a great reward is due to
the monk who labours according to the regulations of the fathers, so
likewise punishment must he inflicted on an idle one; and therefore no
one should be admitted into a monastery too easily.](2110362)
