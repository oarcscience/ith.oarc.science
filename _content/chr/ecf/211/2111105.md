#### <span id="iv.vii.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.i-p1"></span>That Christ, who is God and man in the
unity of Person, sprang from Israel and the Virgin Mary according to the
flesh.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iv.i-p2.1"></span>That</span> divine teacher of the Churches
when in writing to the Romans he was reproving or rather lamenting the
unbelief of the Jews, i.e., of his own brethren, made use of these
words: “I wished myself,” said he, “to be accursed from Christ, for my
brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites,
to whom belongeth the adoption as of children, and the glory, and the
testaments, and the giving of the law, and the ser<span id="page_563">p.
563</span> <span id="iv.vii.iv.i-Page_563"></span>vice of God, and the
promises: whose are the fathers, of whom is Christ according to the
flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever.” <span
id="fr_2417"></span>[2418](#fn_2417) O, the love of that most faithful
Apostle, and most kindly kinsman! who in his infinite charity wished to
die—as a kinsman for his relations, and as a master for his disciples.
And what then was the reason why he wished to die? Only one; viz., that
they might live. But in what did their life consist? Simply in this, as
he himself says, that they might recognize a Divine Christ born
according to the flesh, of their own flesh. And therefore the Apostle
grieved the more, because those who ought to have loved Him the more as
sprung from their own stock, failed to understand that He was born of
Israel. “Of whom,” said he, “is Christ according to the flesh, who is
over all things, God blessed for ever.” Clearly he lays down that from
them according to the flesh, was born that Christ who is over all, God
blessed for ever. You certainly cannot deny that Christ was born from
them according to the flesh. But the same Person, who was born from
them, is God. How can you get round this? How can you shuffle out of it?
The Apostle says that Christ who was born of Israel according to the
flesh, is God. Teach us, if you can, at what time He did not exist. “Of
whom,” he says, “is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all,
God.” You see that because the Apostle has united and joined together
these, “God” cannot possibly be separated from “Christ.” For just as the
Apostle declares that Christ is of them, so he asserts that God is in
Christ. You must either deny both of these statements, or you must
accept both. Christ is said to be born of them according to the flesh:
but the same Person is declared by the Apostle to be “God in Christ.”
Whence also he says elsewhere: “For God was in Christ, reconciling the
world to Himself.” <span id="fr_2418"></span>[2419](#fn_2418) It is
absolutely impossible to separate one from the other. Either deny that
Christ sprang from them, or admit that there was born of the virgin God
in Christ, “who is,” as he says, “over all, God blessed for ever.”
