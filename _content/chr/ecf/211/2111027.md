#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxvii-p1"></span>Why Lent is kept by very many with a
different number of days.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxvii-p2.1"></span>Further</span>, as for what you say;
viz., that in some countries Lent is kept in different ways, i.e., for
six or seven weeks, it is but one system and the same manner of the fast
that is preserved by the different observance of the weeks. For those
who think one ought to fast also on the Saturday, have determined on the
observance of six weeks. They therefore fast for six days out of the
seven, and this being six times repeated makes up the six and thirty
days. It is therefore, as we said, but one system and the same manner of
the fast, although there seems to be a difference in the number of the
weeks.

only kept for thirty-six days.](2111028)
