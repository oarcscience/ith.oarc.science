<p> <a name="iv.iii.ii.ii"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iii.ii.ii-p0.1"></A>Chapter II.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.ii.ii-p1"></A>Of the difference of the number of Psalms appointed to be sung in all the provinces.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.ii.ii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.ii.ii-p2.1"></A>For</span> we have found that many in different countries, according to the fancy of their mind (having, indeed, as the Apostle says, &#8220;a zeal, for God but not according to knowledge&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_673"><FONT SIZE="1">674</FONT></A>
), have made for themselves different rules and arrangements in this matter. For some have appointed that each night twenty or thirty Psalms should be said, and that these should be prolonged by the music of antiphonal singing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_674"></A><A HREF="#fn_674"><FONT SIZE="1">675</FONT></A>
, and by the addition of some modulations as well. Others have even tried to go beyond this number. Some use eighteen. And in this way we have found different rules appointed in different places, and the system and regulations that we have seen are almost as many in number as the monasteries and cells which we have visited. There are some, too, to whom it has seemed good that in the day offices of prayer, viz., Tierce, Sext, and Nones,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_675"><FONT SIZE="1">676</FONT></A>
 the number of Psalms and prayers should be made to correspond exactly to the number of the hours at which the services are offered up to the Lord.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">677</FONT></A>
 Some have thought fit that six Psalms should be assigned to each service of the day. And so I think it best to set forth the most ancient system of the fathers which is still observed by the servants of God throughout the whole of Egypt, so that your new monastery in its untrained infancy in Christ&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">678</FONT></A>
 may be instructed in the most ancient institutions of the earliest fathers.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.ii.ii-p4"></A> <i>Antiphona</i>. In this passage the word appears to mean the actual Psalms sung antiphonally, rather than what is generally meant in later writings by the term. Cf. the Rule of Aurelian, &#8220;Dicite matutinarios, i.e., primo canticum in antiphona, deinde directaneum, judica me Deus&#8230;in antiphona dicite hymnum, splendor patud&aelig; glori&aelig;.&#8221; And see the use of the word later on by Cassian himself, c. vii.</p>
