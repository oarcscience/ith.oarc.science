#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p1"></span>The answer.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-p2.1"></span>Piamun</span>: True patience and
tranquillity is neither gained nor retained without profound humility of
heart: and if it has sprung from this source, there will be no need
either of the good offices of the cell or of the refuge of the desert.
For it will seek no external support from anything, if it has the
internal support of the virtue of humility, its mother and its guardian.
But if we are disturbed when attacked by anyone it is clear that the
foundations of humility have not been securely laid in us, and therefore
at the outbreak even of a small storm, our whole edifice is shaken and
ruinously disturbed. For patience would not be worthy of praise and
admiration if it only preserved its purposed tranquillity when attacked
by no darts of enemies, but it is grand and glorious because when the
storms of temptation beat upon it, it remains unmoved. For wherein it is
believed that a man is annoyed and hurt by adversity, therein is he
strengthened the more; and he is therein the more exercised, wherein he
is thought to be annoyed. For everybody knows that patience gets its
name from the passions and endurance, and so it is clear that no one can
be called patient but one who bears without annoyance all the
indignities offered to him, and so it is not without reason that he is
praised by Solomon: “Better is the patient <span id="page_485">p.
485</span> <span id="iv.vi.ii.xiii-Page_485"></span>man than the strong,
and he who restrains his anger than he who takes a city;” and again:
“For a long-suffering man is mighty in prudence, but a faint-hearted man
is very foolish.” <span id="fr_2085"></span>[2086](#fn_2085) When then
anyone is overcome by a wrong, and blazes up in a fire of anger, we
should not hold that the bitterness of the insult offered to him is the
*cause* of his sin, but rather the *manifestation* of secret weakness,
in accordance with the parable of our Lord and Saviour which He spoke
about the two houses, <span id="fr_2086"></span>[2087](#fn_2086) one of
which was founded upon a rock, and the other upon the sand, on both of
which He says that the tempest of rain and waters and storm beat
equally: but that one which was founded on the solid rock felt no harm
at all from the violence of the shock, while that which was built on the
shifting and moving sand at once collapsed. And it certainly appears
that it fell, not because it was struck by the rush of the storms and
torrents, but because it was imprudently built upon the sand. For a
saint does not differ from a sinner in this, that he is not himself
tempted in the same way, but because he is not worsted even by a great
assault, while the other is overcome even by a slight temptation. For
the fortitude of any good man would not, as we said, be worthy of
praise, if his victory was gained without his being tempted, as most
certainly there is no room for victory where there is no struggle and
conflict: for “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he
has been proved he shall receive the crown of life which God hath
promised to them that love Him.” <span
id="fr_2087"></span>[2088](#fn_2087) According to the Apostle Paul also
“Strength is made perfect” not in ease and delights but “in weakness.”
“For behold,” says He, “I have made thee this day a fortified city, and
a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, over all the land, to the kings
of Judah, and to the princes thereof, and to the priests thereof, and to
all the people of the land. And they shall fight against thee, and shall
not prevail: for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” <span
id="fr_2088"></span>[2089](#fn_2088)
