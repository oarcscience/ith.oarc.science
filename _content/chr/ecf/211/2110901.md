#### <span id="iv.v.vii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.v.vii.x-p1"></span>On the best tests of truth.

<span id="iv.v.vii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.x-p2.1"></span>For</span> I remember, that when my youthful
age suggested to me to cling to a partner, thoughts of this sort often
mingled with our moral training and the Holy Scriptures, so that we
fancied that nothing could be truer or more reasonable: but when we came
together and began to produce our ideas, in the general discussion which
was held, some things were first noted by the others as false and
dangerous, and then presently were condemned and pronounced by common
consent to be injurious; though before they had seemed to shine as if
with a light infused by the devil, so that they would easily have caused
discord, had not the charge of the Elders, observed like some divine
oracle, restrained us from all strife, that charge; namely, whereby it
was ordered by them almost with the force of a law, that neither of us
should trust to his own judgments more than his brother’s, if he wanted
never to be deceived by the craft of the devil.

judgment to escape being deceived by the devil's illusions.](2110902)
