#### <span id="iv.v.iv.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xvii-p1"></span>Of the inscrutable providence of God.

<span id="iv.v.iv.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.xvii-p2.1"></span>By</span> those instances then which we
have brought forward from the gospel records we can very clearly
perceive that God brings salvation to mankind in diverse and innumerable
methods and inscrutable ways, and that He stirs up the course of some,
who are already wanting it, and thirsting for it, to greater zeal, while
He forces some even against their will, and resisting. And that at one
time He gives his assistance for the fulfilment of those things which he
sees that we desire for our good, while at another time He puts into us
the very beginnings of holy desire, and grants both the commencement of
a good work and perseverance in it. Hence it comes that in our <span
id="page_434">p. 434</span> <span
id="iv.v.iv.xvii-Page_434"></span>prayers we proclaim God as not only
our Protector and Saviour, but actually as our Helper and Sponsor. For
whereas He first calls us to Him, and while we are still ignorant and
unwilling, draws us towards salvation, He is our Protector and Saviour,
but whereas when we are already striving, He is wont to bring us help,
and to receive and defend those who fly to Him for refuge, He is termed
our Sponsor and Refuge. Finally the blessed Apostle when revolving in
his mind this manifold bounty of God’s providence, as he sees that he
has fallen into some vast and boundless ocean of God’s goodness,
exclaims: “O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
How inscrutable are the judgments of God and His ways past finding out!
For who hath known the mind of the Lord?” <span
id="fr_1859"></span>[1860](#fn_1859) Whoever then imagines that he can
by human reason fathom the depths of that inconceivable abyss, will be
trying to explain away the astonishment at that knowledge, at which that
great and mighty teacher of the gentiles was awed. For if a man thinks
that he can either conceive in his mind or discuss exhaustively the
dispensation of God whereby He works salvation in men, he certainly
impugns the truth of the Apostle’s words and asserts with profane
audacity that His judgments can be scrutinized, and His ways searched
out. This providence and love of God therefore, which the Lord in His
unwearied goodness vouchsafes to show us, He compares to the tenderest
heart of a kind mother, as He wishes to express it by a figure of human
affection, and finds in His creatures no such feeling of love, to which
he could better compare it. And He uses this example, because nothing
dearer can be found in human nature, saying: “Can a mother forget her
child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?” But
not content with this comparison He at once goes beyond it, and subjoins
these words: “And though she may forget, yet will not I forget
thee.” <span id="fr_1860"></span>[1861](#fn_1860)
