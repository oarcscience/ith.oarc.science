#### <span id="iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iii.x-p1"></span>His warning to the Galatians a warning to
all.

<span id="iii.x-p2"></span>\[24.\] <span class="sc"><span
id="iii.x-p2.1"></span>But</span>, possibly, this warning was intended
for the Galatians only. Be it so; then those other exhortations which
follow in the same Epistle were intended for the Galatians only, such
as, “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit; let us
not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one
another,” etc.; <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457) which
alternative if it be absurd, and the injunctions were meant equally for
all, then it follows, that as these injunctions which relate to morals,
so those warnings which relate to faith are meant equally for all; and
just as it is unlawful for all to provoke one another, or to envy one
another, so, likewise, it is unlawful for all to receive any other
Gospel than that which the Catholic Church preaches everywhere.

<span id="iii.x-p4"></span>\[25.\] Or perhaps the anathema pronounced on
any one who should preach another Gospel than that which had been
preached was meant for those times, not for the present. Then, also, the
exhortation, “Walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the
flesh,” <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458) was meant for those
times, not for the present. But if it be both impious and pernicious to
believe this, then it follows necessarily, that as these injunctions are
to be observed by all ages, so those warnings also which forbid
alteration of the faith are warnings intended for all ages. To preach
any doctrine therefore to Catholic Christians other than what they have
received never was lawful, never is lawful, never will be lawful: and to
anathematize those who preach anything other than what has once been
received, always was a duty, always is a duty, always will be a duty.

<span id="iii.x-p6"></span>\[26.\] Which being the case, is there any
one either so audacious as to preach any other doctrine than that which
the Church preaches, or so inconstant as to receive any other doctrine
than that which he has received from the Church? That elect vessel, that
teacher of the Gentiles, that trumpet of the apostles, that preacher
whose commission was to the whole earth, that man who was caught up to
heaven, <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459) cries and cries again in
his Epistles to all, always, in all places, “If any man preach any new
doctrine, let him be accursed.” On the other hand, an ephemeral,
moribund set of frogs, fleas, and flies, such as the Pelagians, call out
in opposition, and that to Catholics, “Take our word, follow our lead,
accept our exposition, condemn what you used to hold, hold what you used
to condemn, cast aside the ancient faith, the institutes of your
fathers, the trusts left for you by your ancestors and receive
instead,—what? I tremble to utter it: for it is so full of arrogance and
self-conceit, that it seems to me that not only to affirm it, but even
to refute it, cannot be done without guilt in some sort.
