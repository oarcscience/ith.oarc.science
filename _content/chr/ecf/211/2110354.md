#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxv-p1"></span>Of the unique vase of oil thrown away
by Abbot John at his senior’s command.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxv-p2.1"></span>Thus</span> the youth, trained up by
exercises of this sort, daily increased in this virtue of obedience, and
shone forth more and more with the grace of humility; and when the sweet
odour of his obedience spread throughout all the monasteries, some of
the brethren, coming to the elder for the sake of testing him or rather
of being edified by him, marvelled at his obedience of which they had
heard; and so the older called him suddenly, and said, “Go up and take
this cruse of oil” <span id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785) (which was
the only one in the desert and which furnished a very scanty supply of
the rich liquid for their own use and for that of strangers) “and throw
it down out of window.” And he flew up stairs when summoned and threw it
out of window and cast it down to the ground and broke it in pieces
without any thought or consideration of the folly of the command, or
their daily wants, and bodily infirmity, or of their poverty, and the
trials and difficulties of the wretched desert in which, even if they
had got the money for it, oil of that quality, once lost, could not be
procured or replaced.
