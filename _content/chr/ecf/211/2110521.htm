<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.xi.x-p1"></A>An instance showing how King Hezekiah was overthrown by the dart of vainglory.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xi.x-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xi.x-p2.1"></A>For</span> so we read that Hezekiah, King of Judah, a man of most perfect righteousness in all things, and one approved by the witness of Holy Scripture, after unnumbered commendations for his virtues, was overthrown by a single dart of vainglory. And he who by a single prayer of his was able to procure the death of a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the army of the Assyrians, whom the angel destroyed in one night, is overcome by boasting and vanity. Of whom&#8212;to pass over the long list of his virtues, which it would take a long time to unfold&#8212;I will say but this one thing. He was a man who, after the close of his life had been decreed and the day of his death determined by the Lord&#146;s sentence, prevailed by a single prayer to extend the limits set to his life by fifteen years, the sun returning by ten steps, on which it had already shone in its course towards its setting, and by its return dispersing those lines which the shadow that followed its course had already marked, and by this giving two days in one to the whole world, by a stupendous miracle contrary to the fixed laws of nature.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1008"></A><A HREF="#fn_1008"><FONT SIZE="1">1009</FONT></A>
 Yet after signs so great and so incredible, after such immense proofs of his goodness, hear the Scripture tell how he was destroyed by his very successes. &#8220;In those days,&#8221; we are told, &#8220;Hezekiah was sick unto death: and he prayed to the Lord, and He heard him and gave him a sign,&#8221; that, namely of which we read in the fourth book of the kingdoms, which was given by Isaiah the prophet through the going back of the sun. &#8220;But,&#8221; it says, &#8220;he did not render again according to the benefits which he had received, for his heart was lifted up; and wrath was kindled against him and against Judah and Jerusalem: and he humbled himself afterwards because his heart had been lifted up, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and therefore the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1009"></A><A HREF="#fn_1009"><FONT SIZE="1">1010</FONT></A>
 How dangerous, how terrible is the malady of vanity! So much goodness, so many virtues, faith and devotion, great enough to prevail to change nature itself and the laws of the whole world, perish by a single act of pride! So that all his good deeds would have been forgotten as if they had never been, and he would at once have been subject to the wrath of the Lord unless he had appeased Him by recovering his humility: so that he who, at the suggestion of pride, had fallen from so great a height of excellence, could only mount again to the height he had lost by the same steps of humility. Do you want to see another instance of a similar downfall?</p>
