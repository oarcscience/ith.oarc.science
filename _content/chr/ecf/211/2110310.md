#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xiii-p1"></span>The reason why they are not allowed
to go to sleep after the night service. <span
id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704)

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xiii-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.xiii-p3.1"></span>And</span> these labours they keep up
for two reasons, besides this consideration,—that they believe that when
they are diligently exerting themselves they are offering to God a
sacrifice of the fruit of their hands. And, if we are aiming at
perfection; we also ought to observe this with the same diligence.
First, lest our envious adversary, jealous of our purity against which
he is always plotting, and ceaselessly hostile to us, should by some
illusion in a dream pollute the purity which has been gained by the
Psalms and prayers of the night: for after that satisfaction which we
have offered for our negligence and ignorance, and the absolution
implored with profuse sighs in our confession, he anxiously tries, if he
finds some time given to repose, to defile us; then above all
endeavouring to overthrow and weaken our trust in God when he sees by
the purity of our prayers that we are making most fervent efforts
towards God: so that sometimes, when he has been unable to injure some
the whole night long, he does his utmost to disgrace them in that short
hour. Secondly, because, even if no such dreaded illusion of the devil
arises, even a pure sleep in the interval produces laziness in the case
of the monk who ought soon to wake up; and, bringing on a sluggish
torpor in the mind, it dulls his vigour throughout the whole day, and
deadens that keenness <span id="page_211">p. 211</span> <span
id="iv.iii.ii.xiii-Page_211"></span>of perception and exhausts that
energy <span id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705) of heart which would be
capable of keeping us all day long more watchful against all the snares
of the enemy and more robust. Wherefore to the Canonical Vigils there
are added these private watchings, and they submit to them with the
greater care, both in order that the purity which has been gained by
Psalms and prayers may not be lost, and also that a more intense
carefulness to guard us diligently through the day may be secured
beforehand by the meditation of the night.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xiii-p2"></span> *Missæ*.  The use of this word for
the offices of the Canonical Hours, though not common, is found also in
the Thirtieth Canon of the Council of Agde, <span class="sc"><span

morning and evening *missœ*, after the hymns, let the little chapters
from the Psalms be said.”
