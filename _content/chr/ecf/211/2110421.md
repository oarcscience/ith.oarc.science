#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.v-p1"></span>Of the faults which are contracted
through our own fault, without natural impulses.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.v-p2.1"></span>But</span> we affirm that some faults grow
up without any natural occasion giving birth to them, but simply from
the free choice of a corrupt and evil will, as envy and this very sin of
covetousness; which are caught (so to speak) from without, having no
origination in us from natural instincts. But these, in proportion as
they are easily guarded against and readily avoided, just so do they
make wretched the mind that they have got hold of and seized, and hardly
do they suffer it to get at the remedies which would cure it: either
because these who are wounded by persons whom they might either have
ignored, or avoided, or easily overcome, do not deserve to be healed by
a speedy cure, or else because, having laid the foundations badly, they
are unworthy to raise an edifice of virtue and reach the summit of
perfection.

away when once it has been admitted.](2110422)
