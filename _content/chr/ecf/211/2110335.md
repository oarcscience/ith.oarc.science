#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.vi-p1"></span>The reason why the clothes of the
renunciants with which they joined the monastery are preserved by the
steward.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.vi-p2.1"></span>But</span> those clothes, which he laid
aside, are consigned to the care of the steward and kept until by
different sorts of temptations and trials they can recognize the
excellence of his progress and life and endurance. And if they see that
he can continue therein as time goes on, and remain in that fervour with
which he began, they give them away to the poor. But if they find that
he has been guilty of any fault of murmuring, or of even the smallest
piece of disobedience, then they strip off from him the dress of the
monastery in which he had been clad, and reclothe him in his old
garments which had been confiscated, and send him away. <span
id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759) For it is not right for him to go away
with those which he had received, nor do they allow any one to be any
longer dressed in them if they have seen him once grow cold in regard to
the rule of their institution. Wherefore, also, the opportunity of going
out openly is not given to any one, unless he escapes like a runaway
slave by taking advantage of the thickest shades of night, or is judged
unworthy of this order and profession and lays aside the dress of the
monastery and is expelled with shame and disgrace before all the
brethren.
