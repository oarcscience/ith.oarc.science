#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xii-p1"></span>A confession of the modesty which
made us ashamed to reveal our thoughts to the elders.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: The ground of that
hurtful modesty, through which we endeavour to hide bad thoughts, is
especially owing to this reason; viz., that we have heard of a superior
of the Elders in the region of Syria, as it was believed, who, when one
of the brethren had laid bare his thoughts to him in a genuine
confession, was afterwards extremely indignant and severely chid him for
them. Whence it results that while we press them upon our selves and are
ashamed to make them known to the Elders, we cannot obtain the remedies
that would heal them.
