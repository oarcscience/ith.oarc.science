#### <span id="ii.vi.i.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="ii.vi.i.v-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.v-p1.1"></span>Abraham</span>, whose father was Thara, was
born in the one thousand and seventeenth year after the deluge. His wife
was called Sara, and his dwelling-place was at first in the
country <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254) of the Chaldæans. He
then dwelt along with his father at Charræ. Being at this time spoken to
by God, he left his country and his father, and taking with him Lot, the
son of his brother, he came into the country of the Canaanites, and
settled at a place named Sychem. Ere long, owing to the want of corn, he
went into Egypt, and again returned. Lot, owing to the size of the
household, parted from his uncle, that he might take advantage of more
spacious territories in what was then a vacant region, and settled at
Sodom. That town was infamous on account of its inhabitants, males
forcing themselves upon males, and it is said on that account to have
been hateful to God. At that period the kings of the neighboring peoples
were in arms, though previously there had been no <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255) war among mankind. <span
id="page_73">p. 73</span> <span id="ii.vi.i.v-Page_73"></span>But the
kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and of the adjacent territories went forth
to battle against those who were making war upon the regions round
about, and being routed at the first onset, yielded the victory to the
opposite side. Then Sodom was plundered and made a spoil of by the
victorious enemy, while Lot was led into captivity. When Abraham heard
of this, he speedily armed his servants, to the number of three hundred
and eighteen, and, stripping of their spoils and arms the kings flushed
with victory, he put them to flight. Then he was blessed by Melchisedech
the priest, and gave him tithes of the spoil. He restored the remainder
to those from whom it had been taken.
