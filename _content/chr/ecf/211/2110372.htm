<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xliii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xliii-p2.1"></A>And</span> in order that all these things which have been set forth in a somewhat lengthy discourse may be more easily stamped on your heart and may stick in your thoughts with all tenacity, I will make a summary of them so that you may be able to learn all the changes by heart by reason of their brevity and conciseness. Hear then in few words how you can mount up to the heights of perfection without an effort or difficulty. &#8220;The beginning&#8221; of our salvation and &#8220;of wisdom&#8221; is, according to Scripture, &#8220;the fear of the Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_817"></A><A HREF="#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">818</FONT></A>
 From the fear of the Lord arises salutary compunction. From compunction of heart springs renunciation, i.e. nakedness and contempt of all possessions. From nakedness is begotten humility; from humility the mortification of desires. Through mortification of desires all faults are extirpated and decay. By driving out faults virtues shoot up and increase. By the budding of virtues purity of heart is gained. By purity of heart the perfection of apostolic love is acquired.</p>
