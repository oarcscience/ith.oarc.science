#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xix-p1"></span>That it was not only the Spirit,
but Christ Himself also who made Him to be feared.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xix-p2.1"></span>You</span> say too that the Spirit made
Him to be feared by the devils. To reject and refute which, even though
the horrible character of the utterance is enough, we will still add
some instances. Tell me, I pray, you who say that the fact that the
devils feared Him was not His own doing but another’s, and who will have
it that this was not His own power but a gift, how was it that even His
name had that power, of which He Himself was, according to you, void?
How was it that in His name devils were cast out, sick persons were
cured, dead men were raised? For the Apostle Peter says to that lame man
who was sitting at the beautiful gate of the Temple: “In the name of
Jesus Christ arise and walk.” <span id="fr_2640"></span>[2641](#fn_2640)
And again in the city of Joppa to the man who had been lying on his bed
paralysed for eight years he says, “Æneas, may the Lord Jesus Christ
heal thee: arise and make thy bed for thyself.” <span
id="fr_2641"></span>[2642](#fn_2641) Paul too says to the pythonical
spirit: “I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ come out of her,” and
the devil came out of her. <span id="fr_2642"></span>[2643](#fn_2642)
But understand from this how utterly alien this weakness was from our
Lord: for I do not call even those weak, whom He by His name made
strong, since we never heard of any devil or infirmity able to resist
any of the apostles since the Lord’s resurrection. How then did the
Spirit make Him to be feared, who made others to be feared? Or was He in
Himself weak, whose faith even through the instrumentality of others
reigned over all things? Finally those men who received power from God,
never used that power as if it were their own: but referred the power to
Him from whom they received it: for the power itself could never have
any force except through the name of Him who gave it. And so both the
apostles and all the servants of God never did any thing in their own
name, but in the name and invocation of Christ: for the power itself
derived its force from the same source as its origin, and could not be
given through the instrumentality of the ministers, unless it had come
from the Author. You then—who say that the Lord was the same as one of
His servants (for as the apostles had nothing but what they received
from their Lord, so you make out that the Lord Himself had nothing <span
id="page_615">p. 615</span> <span
id="iv.vii.viii.xix-Page_615"></span>but what He received from the
Spirit; and thus you make out that everything that He had, He had not as
Lord, but had received it as a servant), do you tell me then, how it was
that He used this power as His own and not as something which He had
received? For what do we read of Him? He says to the paralytic: “Arise,
take up thy bed, and go to thine house.” <span
id="fr_2643"></span>[2644](#fn_2643) And again to a father who pleads on
behalf of his child, He says: “Go thy way: thy son liveth.” <span
id="fr_2644"></span>[2645](#fn_2644) And where an only son of his mother
was being carried forth for burial, “Young man,” He says, “I say unto
thee Arise.” <span id="fr_2645"></span>[2646](#fn_2645) Did He then like
those who received power from God, ask that power might be given to Him
for performing these things by the invocation of the Divine Name? Why
did He not Himself work by the name of the Spirit, just as the apostles
wrought by His Name? Finally, what does the gospel itself state about
Him? It says: “He was teaching them as one that had authority, and not
like the Scribes and Pharisees.” <span
id="fr_2646"></span>[2647](#fn_2646) Or do you make out that He was so
proud and haughty as to put to the credit of His own might the power
which (according to you) He had received from God? But what do we make
of the fact that the power never submitted to His servants, except
through the name of its author, and could have no efficacy if the actor
claimed any of it as his own?
