<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.x.xxv-p1"></A>Of the character of the sublimer prayer.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.x.xxv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.x.xxv-p2.1"></A>This</span> prayer then though it seems to contain all the fulness of perfection, as being what was originated and appointed by the Lord&#146;s own authority, yet lifts those to whom it belongs to that still higher condition of which we spoke above, and carries them on by a loftier stage to that ardent prayer which is known and tried by but very few, and which to speak more truly is ineffable; which transcends all human thoughts, and is distinguished, I will not say by any sound of the voice, but by no movement of the tongue, or utterance of words, but which the mind enlightened by the infusion of that heavenly light describes in no human and confined language, but pours forth richly as from copious fountain in an accumulation of thoughts, and ineffably utters to God, expressing in the shortest possible space of time such great things that the mind when it returns to its usual condition cannot easily utter or relate. And this condition our Lord also similarly prefigured by the form of those supplications which, when he retired alone in the mountain He is said to have poured forth in silence, and when being in an agony of prayer He shed forth even drops of blood, as an example of a purpose which it is hard to imitate.</p>
