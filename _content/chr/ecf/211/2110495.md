#### <span id="iv.iii.x.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iii.x.x-p1"></span>That for this reason the Apostle
laboured with his own hands, that he might set us an example of work.

<span id="iv.iii.x.x-p2"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.x-p2.1"></span>Not</span> as if we had not power; but that
we might give ourselves a pattern to you to imitate us.” He lays bare
the reason why he imposed such labour on himself: “that we might,” says
he, “give a pattern to you to imitate us, that if by chance you become
forgetful of the teaching of our words which so often passes through
your ears, you may at least keep in your recollection the example of my
manner of life given to you by ocular demonstration. There is here too
no slight reproof of them, where he says that he has gone through this
labour and weariness by night and day, for no other reason but to set an
example, and that nevertheless they would not be instructed, for whose
sakes he, although not obliged to do it, yet imposed on himself such
toil. “And indeed,” he says, “though we had the power, and opportunities
were open to us of using all your goods and substance, and I knew that I
had the permission <span id="fr_974"></span>[975](#fn_974) of our Lord
to use them: yet I did not use this power, lest what was rightly and
lawfully done on my part might set an example of dangerous idleness to
others. And therefore when preaching the gospel, I preferred to be
supported by my own hands and work, that I might open up the way of
perfection to you who wish to walk in the path of virtue, and might set
an example of good life by my work.”
