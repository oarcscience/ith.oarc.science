#### <span id="iv.v.vi.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.v.vi.vii-p1"></span>How the excellence of gifts consists
not in miracles but in humility.

<span id="iv.v.vi.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vi.vii-p2.1"></span>Finally</span> the Author Himself of all
miracles and mighty works, when He called His disciples to learn His
teaching, clearly showed what those true and specially chosen followers
ought chiefly to learn from Him, saying: “Come and learn of Me,” not
chiefly to cast out devils by the power of heaven, not to cleanse the
lepers, not to give sight to the blind, not to raise the dead: for even
though I do these things by some of My servants, yet man’s estate cannot
insert itself into the praises of God, nor can a minister and servant
gather hereby any portion for himself there where is the glory of Deity
alone. But do ye, says He, learn this of Me, “for I am meek and lowly of
heart.” <span id="fr_1954"></span>[1955](#fn_1954) For this it is which
it is possible for all men generally to learn and practise, but the
working of miracles and signs is not always necessary, nor good for all,
nor granted to all. Humility therefore is the mistress of all virtues,
it is the surest foundation of the heavenly building, it is the special
and splendid gift of the Saviour. For he can perform all the miracles
which Christ wrought, without danger of being puffed up, who follows the
gentle Lord not in the grandeur of His miracles, but in the virtues of
patience and humility. But he who aims at commanding unclean spirits, or
bestowing gifts of healing, or showing some wonderful miracle to the
people, even though when he is showing off he invokes the name of
Christ, yet he is far from Christ, because in his pride of heart he does
not follow his humble Teacher. For when He was returning to the Father,
He prepared, so to speak, His will and left this to His disciples: “A
new commandment,” said He, “give I unto you that ye love one another; as
I have loved you, so do ye also love one another:” and at once He
subjoined: “By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye
have love to one another.” <span id="fr_1955"></span>[1956](#fn_1955) He
says not: “if ye do signs and miracles in the same way,” but “if ye have
love to one another;” and this it is certain that none but the meek and
humble can keep. Wherefore our predecessors never reckoned those as good
monks or free from the fault of vainglory, who professed themselves
exorcists among men, and proclaimed with boastful ostentation among
admiring crowds the grace which they had either obtained or which they
claimed. But in vain, for “he who trusteth in lies feedeth the winds:
and the same runneth after birds that fly away.” <span
id="fr_1956"></span>[1957](#fn_1956) For without doubt that will happen
to them which we find in Proverbs: “As the winds and clouds and rain are
very clear so are these who boast of a fictitious gift.” <span
id="fr_1957"></span>[1958](#fn_1957) And so if any one does any of these
things in our presence, he ought to meet with commendation from us not
from admiration of his miracles, but from the beauty of his life, nor
should we ask whether the devils are subject to him, but whether he
possesses those features of love which the Apostle describes.
