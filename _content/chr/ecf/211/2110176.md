#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xlii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLII.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xlii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xlii-p1.1"></span>In</span> his room Abiud his son held the
kingdom at Jerusalem for six years, although he is said in the
Chronicles <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313) to have reigned three
years. Asab his son succeeded him, being the fifth from David, as he was
his great-great-grandson. He was a pious worshiper of God; for,
destroying the altars and the groves of the idols, he removed the traces
of his father’s faithlessness. He formed an alliance with the king of
Syria, and by his help inflicted much loss on the kingdom of Jeroboam,
which was then held by his son, and often, after conquering the enemy,
carried off spoil as the result of victory. After forty-one years he
died, afflicted with disease in his feet. To him sin of a three-fold
kind is ascribed; first, that he trusted too much to his alliance with
the king of Syria; secondly, that he cast into prison a prophet of God
who rebuked him for this; and thirdly, that, when suffering from disease
in his feet, he sought a remedy, not from God, but from the physicians.
In the beginning of his reign died Jeroboam, king of the ten tribes, and
left his throne to his son Nabath. He, from his wicked works, and, both
by his own and his <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314) father’s
doings, hateful to God, did not possess the kingdom more than two years,
and his children, as being unworthy, were deprived <span
id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315) of the government. He had for his
successor Baasa, the son of Achia, and he proved himself equally
estranged from God. He died in the twenty-sixth year of his reign: and
his power passed to Ela his son, but was not retained more than two
years. For Zambri, leader of his cavalry, killed him at a banquet, and
seized the kingdom,—a man equally odious to God and men. A portion of
the people revolted from him, and the royal power was conferred on one
Thamnis. But Zambri reigned before him seven years, and at the same time
with him twelve years. And, on the death of Asab, Josaphat his son began
to reign over part of the tribe of Judah, a man deservedly famous for
his pious virtues. He lived at peace with Zambri; and he died, after a
reign of twenty-five years.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xlii-p4"></span> It is remarkable, as Hornius has
observed after Ligonius, that, while in the kingdom of Judah the
sovereignty remained to the same family, in the kingdom of Ephraim the
scepter was hardly ever transmitted to son or grandson.
