#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxvi-p1"></span>The answer that the weak does not
always allow himself to be borne.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Joseph</span>: I did not say that the
virtue and endurance of one who is strong and robust would be overcome,
but that the miserable condition of the weak, encouraged by the
tolerance of the perfect, and daily growing worse, is sure to give rise
to reasons on account of which he himself ought no longer to be borne;
or else with a shrewd suspicion that the patience of his neighbour shows
up and sets off his own impatience at some time or other he chooses to
make off rather than always to be borne by the magnanimity of the other.
This then we think should be above all else observed by those who want
to keep the affec<span id="page_459">p. 459</span> <span
id="iv.v.vii.xxvi-Page_459"></span>tion of their companions unimpaired;
viz., that first of all when provoked by any wrongs, a monk should keep
not only his lips but even the depth of his breast unmoved: but if he
finds that they are even slightly disturbed, let him keep himself in by
entire silence, and diligently observe what the Psalmist speaks of: “I
was troubled and spake nothing;” and: “I said I will take heed to thy
ways that I offend not with my tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth,
when the sinner stood against me. I was dumb and was humbled, and kept
silence from good things;” <span id="fr_2002"></span>[2003](#fn_2002)
and he should not pay any heed to his present state, nor give vent to
what his violent rage suggests and his exasperated mind expresses at the
moment, but should dwell on the grace of past love or look forward in
his mind to the renewal and restoration of peace, and contemplate it
even in the very hour of rage, as if it were sure presently to return.
And while he is reserving himself for the delight of harmony soon to
come, he will not feel the bitterness of the present quarrel and will
easily make such answers that, when love is restored, he will not be
able to accuse himself as guilty or be blamed by the other; and thus he
will fulfil these words of the prophet: “In wrath remember mercy.” <span
