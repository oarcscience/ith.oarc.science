<span id="iv.vi.viii.xvii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xvii-p1"></span>How the weaker part of the soul is
the first to yield to the devil’s temptations.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xvii-p2.1"></span>You</span> should then apply to this
member or part of the soul which we have described as particularly
wounded, the remedy of true humility: for as, so far as appears, it is
weaker than the other powers of the soul in you, it is sure to be the
first to yield to the assaults of the devil. As when some injuries come
upon us, which are caused either by toil laid upon us or by a bad
atmosphere, it is generally the case in the bodies of men that those
which are the weaker are the first to give in and yield to those
chances, and when the disease has more particularly laid hold <span
id="page_539">p. 539</span> <span
id="iv.vi.viii.xvii-Page_539"></span>of them, it affects the sound parts
of the body also with the same mischief, so also, when the pestilent
blast of sin breathes over us the soul of each one of us is sure to be
tempted above all by that passion, in the case of which its feebler and
weaker portion does not make so stubborn a resistance to the powerful
attacks of the foe, and to run the risk of being taken captive by those,
in the case of which a careless watch opens an easier way to betrayal.
For so Balsam <span id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315) gathered that
God’s people could be by a sure method deceived, when he advised, that
in that quarter, wherein he knew that the children of Israel were weak,
the dangerous snares should be set for them, as he had no doubt that
when a supply of women was offered to them, they would at once fall and
be destroyed by fornication, because he was aware that the parts of
their souls which were subject to desire were corrupted. So then the
spiritual wickednesses tempt with crafty malice each one of us, by
particularly laying insidious snares for those affections of the soul,
in which they have seen that it is weak, as for instance, if they see
that the reasonable parts of our soul are affected, they try to deceive
us in the same way that the Scripture tells us that king Ahab was
deceived by those Syrians, who said: “We know that the kings of Israel
are merciful: And so let us put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes
round our heads, and go out to the king of Israel, and say to him: Thy
servant Benhadad saith: I pray thee, let my soul live.” And thereby he
was affected by no true goodness, but by the empty praise of his
clemency, and said: “If he still liveth, he is my brother;” and after
this fashion they can deceive us also by the error of that reasonable
part, and make us incur the displeasure of God owing to that from which
we were hoping that we might gain a reward and receive the recompense of
goodness, and to us too the same rebuke may be addressed: “Because thou
hast let go from thy hand a man who was worthy of death, thy life shall
be for his life, and thy people for his people” <span
id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316) Or when the unclean spirit says: “I
will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
prophets,” <span id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317) he certainly
spread the nets of deception by means of the reasonable feeling which he
knew to be exposed to his deadly wiles. And this also the same spirit
expected in the case of our Lord, when he tempted Him in these three
affections of the soul, wherein he knew that all mankind had been taken
captive, but gained nothing by his crafty wiles. For he approached that
portion of his mind which was subject to desire, when he said: “Command
that these stones be made bread;” the part subject to wrath, when he
tried to incite Him to seek the power of the present life and the
kingdoms of this world; the reasonable part when he said: “If Thou art
the Son of God cast Thyself down from hence.” <span
id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318) And in these his deception availed
nothing for this reason because he found that there was nothing damaged
in Him, in accordance with the supposition which he had formed from a
false idea. Wherefore no part of His soul yielded when tempted by the
wiles of the foe, “For lo,” He saith, “the prince of this world cometh
and shall find nothing in Me.” <span
