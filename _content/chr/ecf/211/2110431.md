#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xv-p1"></span>Of the difference between one who
renounces the world badly and one who does not renounce it at all.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xv-p2.1"></span>Of</span> those then who say that they
have renounced this world, and afterwards being overcome by want of
faith are afraid of losing their worldly goods, a charge is given
mystically in Deuteronomy. “If any man is afraid and of a fearful heart
let him not go forth to war: let him go back and return home, lest he
make the hearts of his brethren to fear as he himself is timid and
frightened.” <span id="fr_884"></span>[885](#fn_884) What can one want
plainer than this testimony? Does not Scripture clearly prefer that they
should not take on them even the earliest stages of this profession and
its name, rather than by their persuasion and bad example turn others
back from the perfection of the gospel, and weaken them by their
faithless terror. And so they are bidden to withdraw from the battle and
return to their homes, because a man cannot fight the Lord’s battle with
a double heart. For “a double-minded man is unstable in all his
ways.” <span id="fr_885"></span>[886](#fn_885) And thinking, according
to that <span id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span
id="iv.iii.vii.xv-Page_253"></span>Parable in the Gospel, <span
id="fr_886"></span>[887](#fn_886) that he who goes forth with ten
thousand men against a king who comes with twenty thousand, cannot
possibly fight, they should, while he is yet a great way off, ask for
peace; that is, it is better for them not even to take the first step
towards renunciation, rather than afterwards following it up coldly, to
involve themselves in still greater dangers. For “it is better not to
vow, than to vow and not pay.” <span id="fr_887"></span>[888](#fn_887)
But finely is the one described as coming with ten thousand and the
other with twenty. For the number of sins which attack us is far larger
than that of the virtues which fight for us. But “no man can serve God
and Mammon.” <span id="fr_888"></span>[889](#fn_888) And “no man putting
his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of
God.” <span id="fr_889"></span>[890](#fn_889)
