#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.x-p1"></span>How no one can obtain perfect virtue
and the promised bliss by his own strength alone.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.x-p2.1"></span>For</span> the will and course of no one,
however eager and anxious, <span id="fr_1046"></span>[1047](#fn_1046) is
sufficiently ready for him, while still enclosed in the flesh which
warreth against the spirit, to reach so great a prize of perfection, and
the palm of uprightness and purity, unless he is protected by the divine
compassion, so that he is privileged to attain to that which he greatly
desires and to which he runs. For “every good gift and every perfect
gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.” <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[1048](#fn_1047) “For what hast thou which thou
didst not receive? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as
if thou hadst not received it?” <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[1049](#fn_1048)
