#### <span id="iv.v.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.v.iv.i-p1"></span>Introduction.

<span id="iv.v.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.i-p2.1"></span>When</span> after a short sleep we returned
for morning service and were waiting for the old man, Abbot Germanus was
troubled by great scruples because in the previous discussion, the force
of which had inspired us with the utmost longing for this chastity which
was till now unknown to us, the blessed old man had by the addition of a
single sentence broken down the claims of man’s exertions, adding that
man even though he strive with all his <span id="page_423">p. 423</span>
<span id="iv.v.iv.i-Page_423"></span>might for a good result, yet cannot
become master of what is good unless he has acquired it simply by the
gift of Divine bounty and not by the efforts of his own toil. While then
we were puzzling over this question the blessed Chæremon arrived at the
cell, and as he saw that we were whispering together about something, he
cut the service of prayers and Psalms shorter than usual, and asked us
what was the matter.
