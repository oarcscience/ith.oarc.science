<span id="iv.v.v.xi"></span>

#### <span id="iv.v.v.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.v.v.xi-p1"></span>Of the manifold meaning of the Holy
Scriptures.

<span id="iv.v.v.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.xi-p2.1"></span>But</span> as the renewal of our soul grows
by means of this study, Scripture also will begin to put on a new face,
and the beauty of the holier meanings will somehow grow with our growth.
For their form is adapted to the capacity of man’s understanding, and
will appear earthly to carnal people, and divine to spiritual ones, so
that those to whom it formerly appeared to be involved in thick clouds,
cannot apprehend its subtleties nor endure its light. But to make this
which we are aiming at somewhat clearer by an instance, it will be
enough to produce a single passage of the law, by which we can prove
that all the heavenly commands as well are applied to men in accordance
with the measure of our state. For it is written in the law: “Thou shalt
not commit adultery.” <span id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895) This is
rightly observed according to the simple meaning of the letter, by a man
who is still in bondage to foul passions. But by one who has already
forsaken these dirty acts and impure affections, it must be observed in
the spirit, so that he may forsake not only the worship of idols but
also all heathen superstitions and the observance of auguries and omens
and all signs and days and times, or at any rate that he be not
entangled in the conjectures of words and names which destroy the
simplicity of our faith. For by fornication of this kind we read that
Jerusalem was defiled, as she committed adultery “on every high hill and
under every green tree,” <span id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896) whom
also the Lord rebuked by the prophet, saying: “Let now the astrologers
stand and save thee, they that gazed at the stars and counted the
months, that from them they might tell the things that shall come to
thee,” <span id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897) of which fornication
elsewhere also <span id="page_441">p. 441</span> <span
id="iv.v.v.xi-Page_441"></span>the Lord says in rebuking them: “The
spirit of fornication deceived them, and they went a whoring from their
God.” <span id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898) But one who has
forsaken both these kinds of fornication, will have a third kind to
avoid, which is contained in the superstitions of the law and of
Judaism; of which the Apostle says: “Ye observe days and months and
times and years;” and again: Touch not, taste not, handle not.” <span
id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899) And there is no doubt that this is
said of the superstitions of the law, into which one who has fallen has
certainly gone a whoring from Christ, and is not worthy to hear this
from the Apostle: “For I have espoused you to one husband, to exhibit
you as a chaste virgin to Christ.” <span
id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900) But this that follows will be
directed to him by the words of the same Apostle: “But I am afraid lest
as the serpent by his cunning deceived Eve, so your minds should be
corrupted and fall from the simplicity which is in Christ Jesus.” <span
id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901) But if one has escaped the
uncleanness even of this fornication there will still be a fourth, which
is committed by adulterous intercourse with heretical teaching. Of which
too the blessed Apostle speaks: “I know that after my departure grievous
wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock, and of
yourselves also shall arise men speaking perverse things so as to lead
astray the disciples after them.” <span
id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902) But if a man has succeeded in
avoiding even this, let him beware lest he fall by a more subtle sin
into the guilt of fornication. I mean that which consists in wandering
thoughts, because every thought which is not only shameful but even
idle, and departing in however small a degree from God is regarded by
the perfect man as the foulest fornication.
