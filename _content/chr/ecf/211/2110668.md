#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.v-p1"></span>How our Lord alone was tempted without
sin.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.v-p2.1"></span>And</span> so our Lord Jesus Christ, though
declared by the Apostle’s word to have been tempted in all points like
as we are, is yet said to have been “without sin,” <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[1319](#fn_1318) i.e., without the infection of this
appetite, as He knew nothing of incitements of carnal lust, with which
we are sure to be troubled even against our will and without our
knowledge; <span id="fr_1319"></span>[1320](#fn_1319) for the archangel
thus describes the manner of His conception: “The Holy Ghost shall come
upon thee and the power of the Most High <span id="page_341">p.
341</span> <span id="iv.iv.vi.v-Page_341"></span>shall overshadow thee:
therefore that which shall be born of thee shall be called holy, the Son
of God.” <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1321](#fn_1320)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.v-p4"></span> The following from D. Mozley’s profound
work on the Augustinian Theory of Predestination may serve to illustrate
the remarks in the text: “Scripture says that our Lord was in all points
tempted like as we are. But the Church has not considered it consistent
with piety to interpret this text to mean that our Lord had the same
direct propension to sin that we have, or that which is called by
divines concupiscence. Such direct appetite for what is sinful is the
characteristic of our fallen and corrupt nature, and our Lord did not
assume a corrupt, but a sound humanity. Indeed, concupiscence, even
prior to and independent of its gratification has of itself the nature
of sin; and therefore could not belong to a perfect Being. Our Lord had
all the passions and affections that legitimately belong to man; which
passions and affections, tending as they do in their own natures to
become inordinate, constituted of themselves a state of trial; but the
Church has regarded our Lord’s trial as consisting in preserving
ordinate affections from becoming inordinate, rather than in restraining
desire proximate to sin from gratification” (p. 97).
