#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.vii-p1"></span>How vainglory, when it has been
overcome, rises again keener than ever for the fight.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.vii-p2.1"></span>All</span> vices when overcome grow
feeble, and when beaten are day by day rendered weaker, and both in
regard to place and time grow less and subside, or at any rate, as they
are unlike the opposite virtues, are more easily shunned and avoided:
but this one when it is beaten rises again keener than ever for the
struggle; and when we think that it is destroyed, it revives again, the
stronger for its <span id="page_277">p. 277</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xi.vii-Page_277"></span>death. The other kinds of vices
usually only attack those whom they have overcome in the conflict; but
this one pursues its victors only the more keenly; and the more
thoroughly it has been resisted, so much the more vigorously does it
attack the man who is elated by his victory over it. And herein lies the
crafty cunning of our adversary, namely, in the fact that, where he
cannot overcome the soldier of Christ by the weapons of the foe, he lays
him low by his own spear.
