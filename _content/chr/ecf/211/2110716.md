#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.vii-p1"></span>A question on the roving tendency of
the mind and the attacks of spiritual wickedness.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.vii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: Perhaps this tendency
of the mind to rove might to some extent be checked were it not that so
great a swam of enemies surrounded it, and ceaselessly urged it toward
what it has no wish for, or rather whither the roving character of its
own nature drives it. And since such numberless foes, and those so
powerful and terrible, surround it, we should not fancy that it was
possible for them to be withstood especially by this weak flesh of ours,
were we not encouraged to this view by your words as if by oracles from
heaven.
