### <span id="iv.v.i-p0.1"></span>Preface.

<span id="iv.v.i-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.i-p1.1"></span>Although</span> many of the saints who are
taught by your example can scarcely emulate the greatness of your
perfection, with which you shine like great luminaries with marvellous
brightness in this world, yet still you, O holy brothers Honoratus and
Eucherius, <span id="fr_1681"></span>[1682](#fn_1681) are so stirred by
the great glory of those splendid men from whom we received the first
principles of monasticism, that one of you, presiding as he does over a
large monastery of the brethren, is hoping that his congregation, which
learns a lesson from the daily sight of your saintly life, may be
instructed in the precepts of those fathers, while the other has been
anxious to make his way to Egypt to be edified by the sight of these in
the flesh, that he might leave this province that is frozen as it were
with the cold of Gaul, and like some pure turtle dove fly to those lands
on which the sun of righteousness looks and to which it approaches
nearest, and which abound with the ripe fruits of virtues. As a matter
of course the greatness of my love wrings this from me; viz., that
considering the desire of the one and the labour of the other, I should
not decline the danger and peril of writing, if only to the one there
may be added authority among his children, and from the other may be
removed the necessity for so risky a journey. Further since neither the
Institutes of the Cœnobia which we wrote to the best of our ability in
twelve books for Bishop Castor of blessed memory, nor the ten
Conferences of the fathers living in the desert of Scete, which we
composed somehow or other at the bidding of Saints Helladius and
Leontius the Bishops, <span id="fr_1682"></span>[1683](#fn_1682) were
able to satisfy your faith and zeal, now in order that the reason for
our journey may be also known, I have thought that seven Conferences of
the three fathers whom we first saw living in another desert, might be
written in the same style and dedicated to you, in which whatever has
been in our previous works perhaps obscurely explained or even omitted
on the subject of perfection, may be supplied. But if even this is not
enough to satisfy the holy thirst of your desires, seven other
Conferences, which are to be sent to the holy brethren living in the
islands of the Stœchades, <span id="fr_1683"></span>[1684](#fn_1683)
will, I fancy, satisfy your wants and your ardour.
