<p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vii.xxiv-p1"></A>How the weak are harmful and cannot bear wrongs.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vii.xxiv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vii.xxiv-p2.1"></A>We</span> must note too the fact that the nature of the weak is always such that they are quick and ready to offer reproaches and sow the seeds of quarrels, while they themselves cannot bear to be touched by the shadow of the very slightest wrong, and while they are riding roughshod over us and flinging about wanton charges, they are not able to bear even the slightest and most trivial ones themselves. And so according to the aforesaid opinion of the Elders love cannot last firm and unbroken except among men of the same purpose and goodness. For at some time or other it is sure to be broken, however carefully it may be guarded by one of them.</p>
