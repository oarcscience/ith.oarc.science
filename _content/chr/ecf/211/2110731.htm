 And far more must we hold that they cannot of their own free will enter into any one of men who are created in the image of God, if they have not power to enter into dumb and unclean animals without the permission of God. But no one&#8212;I will not say of the younger men, whom we see living most steadfastly in this desert, but even of those who are perfect&#8212;could live alone in the desert, surrounded by such swarms of foes of this kind, if they had unlimited power and freedom to hurt and tempt us: and still more clearly is this supported by the words of our Lord and Saviour, which in the lowliness of the manhood He had assumed, He uttered to Pilate, when He said: &#8220;Thou couldest have no power against Me at all, unless it were given thee from above.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1487"></A><A HREF="#fn_1487"><FONT SIZE="1">1488</FONT></A>
