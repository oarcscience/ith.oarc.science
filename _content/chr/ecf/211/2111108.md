#### <span id="iv.vii.iv.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.iv-p1"></span>From the Epistle to the Galatians he
brings forward a passage to show that the weakness of the flesh in
Christ was absorbed by His Divinity.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iv.iv-p2.1"></span>The</span> Apostle indeed declares this in
the whole body of his writings, and admirably says in writing to the
Galatians: “Paul an Apostle not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
Christ and God the Father.” <span id="fr_2424"></span>[2425](#fn_2424)
You see how thoroughly consistent he is with himself in the former and
the present passage. For there he says: “Now we no longer know Christ
according to the flesh.” Here he says: “Not of men, neither by man, but
by Jesus Christ.” It is clear that his doctrine is the same here as in
the former passage. For where he says that he is not sent by man, he
implies: “We have not known Christ according to the flesh:” and so I am
“not sent by man” but “by Christ;” <span
id="fr_2425"></span>[2426](#fn_2425) for if I am sent by Christ, I am
not sent by man but by God. For there is no longer room for the name of
man, in Him whom Divinity claims entirely for itself. And so when he had
said that he was sent “not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ,”
he rightly added: “And God the Father,” thus showing that he was sent by
God the Father and God the Son; in whom owing to the mystery of the
sacred and ineffable generation there are two Persons (He who begets,
and He who is begotten), but there is but one single Power of God who is
the sender. And so in saying that he was sent by God the Father and God
the Son, he shows that the Persons are two in number, but he also
teaches that their Power is One in sending.

Christ, so also is it blasphemous to deny that He is true man.](2111109)
