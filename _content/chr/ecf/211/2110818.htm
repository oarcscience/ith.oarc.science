<p> <a name="iv.iv.xi.xi"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.xi.xi-p0.1"></A>Chapter XI.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.xi.xi-p1"></A>Of the perfection of prayer to which we can rise by the system described.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.xi.xi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.xi.xi-p2.1"></A>This</span>, this is the formula which the mind should unceasingly cling to until, strengthened by the constant use of it and by continual meditation, it casts off and rejects the rich and full material of all manner of thoughts and restricts itself to the poverty of this one verse, and so arrives with ready ease at that beatitude of the gospel, which holds the first place among the other beatitudes: for He says &#8220;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1675"></A><A HREF="#fn_1675"><FONT SIZE="1">1676</FONT></A>
 And so one who becomes grandly poor by a poverty of this sort will fulfil this saying of the prophet: &#8220;The poor and needy shall praise the name of the Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1676"></A><A HREF="#fn_1676"><FONT SIZE="1">1677</FONT></A>
 And indeed what greater or holier poverty can there be than that of one who knowing that he has no defence and no strength of his own, asks for daily help from another&#146;s bounty, and as he is aware that every single moment his life and substance depend on Divine assistance, professes himself not without reason the Lord&#146;s bedesman, and cries to Him daily in prayer: &#8220;But I am poor and needy: the Lord helpeth me.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1677"></A><A HREF="#fn_1677"><FONT SIZE="1">1678</FONT></A>
 And so by the illumination of God Himself he mounts to that manifold knowledge of Him and begins henceforward to be nourished on sublimer and still more sacred mysteries, in accordance with these words of the prophet: &#8220;The high hills are a refuge for the stags, the rocks for the  <A NAME="page_408"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 408</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.xi.xi-Page_408"></A>hedgehogs,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1678"></A><A HREF="#fn_1678"><FONT SIZE="1">1679</FONT></A>
 which is very fairly applied in the sense we have given, because whosoever continues in simplicity and innocence is not injurious or offensive to any one, but being content with his own simple condition endeavours simply to defend himself from being spoiled by his foes, and becomes a sort of spiritual hedgehog and is protected by the continual shield of that rock of the gospel, i.e., being sheltered by the recollection of the Lord&#146;s passion and by ceaseless meditation on the verse given above he escapes the snares of his opposing enemies. And of these spiritual hedgehogs we read in Proverbs as follows: &#8220;And the hedgehogs are a feeble folk, who have made their homes in the rocks.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1679"></A><A HREF="#fn_1679"><FONT SIZE="1">1680</FONT></A>
 And indeed what is feebler than a Christian, what is weaker than a monk, who is not only not permitted any vengeance for wrongs done to him but is actually not allowed to suffer even a slight and silent feeling of irritation to spring up within? But whoever advances from this condition and not only secures the simplicity of innocence, but is also shielded by the virtue of discretion, becomes an exterminator of deadly serpents, and has Satan crushed beneath his feet, and by his quickness of mind answers to the figure of the reasonable stag, this man will feed on the mountains of the prophets and Apostles, i.e., on their highest and loftiest mysteries. And thriving on this pasture continually, he will take in to himself all the thoughts of the Psalms and will begin to sing them in such a way that he will utter them with the deepest emotion of heart not as if they were the compositions of the Psalmist, but rather as if they were his own utterances and his very own prayer; and will certainly take them as aimed at himself, and will recognize that their words were not only fulfilled formerly by or in the person of the prophet, but that they are fulfilled and carried out daily in his own case. For then the Holy Scriptures lie open to us with greater clearness and as it were their very veins and marrow are exposed, when our experience not only perceives but actually anticipates their meaning, and the sense of the words is revealed to us not by an exposition of them but by practical proof. For if we have experience of the very state of mind in which each Psalm was sung and written, we become like their authors and anticipate the meaning rather than follow it, i.e., gathering the force of the words before we really know them, we remember what has happened to us, and what is happening in daily assaults when the thoughts of them come over us, and while we sing them we call to mind all that our carelessness has brought upon us, or our earnestness has secured, or Divine Providence has granted or the promptings of the foe have deprived us of, or slippery and subtle forgetfulness has carried off, or human weakness has brought about, or thoughtless ignorance has cheated us of. For all these feelings we find expressed in the Psalms so that by seeing whatever happens as in a very clear mirror we understand it better, and so instructed by our feelings as our teachers we lay hold of it as something not merely heard but actually seen, and, as if it were not committed to memory, but implanted in the very nature of things, we are affected from the very bottom of the heart, so that we get at its meaning not by reading the text but by experience anticipating it. And so our mind will reach that incorruptible prayer to which in our former treatise, as the Lord vouchsafed to grant, the scheme of our Conference mounted, and this is not merely not engaged in gazing on any image, but is actually distinguished by the use of no words or utterances; but with the purpose of the mind all on fire, is produced through ecstasy of heart by some unaccountable keenness of spirit, and the mind being thus affected without the aid of the senses or any visible material pours it forth to God with groanings and sighs that cannot be uttered.</p>
