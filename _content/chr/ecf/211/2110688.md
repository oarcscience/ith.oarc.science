#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxv-p1"></span>Different passages of Scripture on the
meaning of the eight faults.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xxv-p2.1"></span>And</span> in reference to these eight
faults we also have the following in the gospel: “But when the unclean
spirit is gone out from a man, he walketh through dry places seeking
rest and findeth none. Then he saith, I will return to my house from
whence I came out: and coming he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished:
then he goeth and taketh seven other spirits worse than himself, and
they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is made
worse than the first.” <span id="fr_1359"></span>[1360](#fn_1359) Lo,
just as in the former passages we read of seven nations besides that of
the Egyptians from which the children of Israel had gone forth, so here
too seven unclean spirits are said to return beside that one which we
first hear of as going forth from the man. And of this sevenfold
incentive of sins Solomon gives the following account in Proverbs: “If
thine enemy speak loud to thee, do not agree to him because there are
seven mischiefs in his heart;” <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[1361](#fn_1360) i.e., if the spirit of gluttony is
overcome and begins to flatter you with having humiliated it, asking in
a sort of way that you would relax something of the fervour with which
you began, and yield to it something beyond what the due limits of
abstinence, and measure of strict severity would allow, do not you be
overcome by its submission, nor return in fancied security from its
assaults, as you seem to have become for a time freed from carnal
desires, to your previous state of carelessness or former liking for
good things. For through this the spirit whom you have vanquished is
saying “I will return to my house from whence I came out,” and forthwith
the seven spirits of sins which proceed from it will prove to you more
injurious than that passion which in the first instance you overcame,
and will presently drag you down to worse kinds of sins.
