Wherefore, to make this book as short as possible we will produce and set down two or three out of the whole number of the Fathers; and first of all Abbot John who lived near Lycon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_782"><FONT SIZE="1">783</FONT></A>
 which is a town in the Thebaid; and who was exalted even to the grace of prophecy for his admirable obedience, and was so celebrated all the world over that he was by his merits rendered famous even among kings of this world. For though, as we said, he lived in the most remote parts of the Thebaid, still the Emperor Theodosius did not venture to declare war against the most powerful tyrants before he was encouraged by his utterances and replies: trusting in which as if they had been brought to him from heaven he gained victories over his foes in battles which seemed hopeless.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_783"></A><A HREF="#fn_783"><FONT SIZE="1">784</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p4"></A> This John of Lycopolis was one of the most celebrated hermits of the fourth century. Originally a carpenter, he retired at the age of twenty-five into the wilderness, and after the death of his instructor settled near Lycopolis. Here, as Cassian tells us, he received as reward for his obedience the gift of prophecy, and was consulted by crowds who came to him for this purpose and among others by the Emperor Theodosius, to whom he foretold (1) his victory over the usurper Maximus (<span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p4.1"></A>a.d</span>. 388), and (2) his success against Eugenius in <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p4.2"></A>a.d.</span> 395. He is mentioned again by Cassian in the Conferences I. xxi., XXIV. xxvi., etc. A full account of him is given by Rufinus in his history of the monks c. i. and by Palladius in the Lausiac History 43&#8211;60; he is also mentioned by Augustine De Civitate Dei, Book V. c. xxvi, De Cura pro mortius gerenda, c. xvii., and Jerome Ep. cxxxiii.<a name="iv.iii.iv.xxiii-p4.3"></A> ad Ctesiphontem, as well as by Theodoret H. E. V. xxiv, and Sozomen H. E. VI. xxviii.</p>
