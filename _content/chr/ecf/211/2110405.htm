<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.v.xxxii-p2.1"></A>Nor</span> do I think it less needful to relate this act of a brother who was intent on purity of heart, and extremely anxious with regard to the contemplation of things divine. When after an interval of fifteen years a large number of letters had been brought to him from his father and mother and many friends in the province of Pontus, he received the huge packet of letters, and turning over the matter in his own mind for some time, &#8220;What thoughts,&#8221; said he, &#8220;will the reading of these suggest to me, which will incite me either to senseless joy or to useless sadness! for how many days will they draw off the attention of my heart from the contemplation I have set before me, by the recollection of those who wrote them! How long will it take for the disturbance of mind thus created to be calmed, and what an  <A NAME="page_245"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 245</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.v.xxxii-Page_245"></A>effort will it cost for that former state of peacefulness to be restored, if the mind is once moved by the sympathy of the letters, and by recalling the words and looks of those whom it has left for so long begins once more in thought and spirit to revisit them, to dwell among them and to be with them. And it will be of no use to have forsaken them in the body, if one begins to look on them with the heart, and readmits and revives that memory which on renouncing this world every one gave up, as if he were dead.&#8221; Turning this over in his mind, he determined not only not to read a single letter, but not even to open the packet, for fear lest, at the sight of the names of the writers, or on recalling their appearance, the purpose of his spirit might give way. And so he threw it into the fire to be burnt, all tied up just as he had received it, crying, &#8220;Away, O ye thoughts of my home, be ye burnt up, and try no further to recall me to those things from which I have fled.&#8221;</p>
