#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xxxiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXIV.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxxiv-p1"></span>How a man can be shown to be under
grace.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxxiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxxiv-p2.1"></span>Whoever</span> then strives to reach the
perfection of evangelical teaching, this man living under grace is not
oppressed by the dominion of sin, for to be under grace is to do those
things which grace commands. But whoever will not submit himself to the
complete requirements of evangelical perfection, must not remain
ignorant that, although he seems to be baptized and to be a monk, yet he
is not under grace, but is still shackled by the chains of the law, and
weighed down by the burden of sin. For it is the aim of Him, who by the
<span id="page_518">p. 518</span> <span
id="iv.vi.v.xxxiv-Page_518"></span>grace of adoption accepts all those
by whom He has been received, not to destroy but to build upon, not to
abolish but to fulfil the Mosaic requirements. But some knowing nothing
about this, and disregarding the splendid counsels and exhortations of
Christ, are so emancipated by the carelessness of a freedom too hastily
assumed, that they not only fail to carry out the commands of Christ as
if they were too hard, but actually scorn as antiquated, the commands
given to them as beginners and children by the law of Moses, saying in
this dangerous freedom of theirs that which the Apostle execrates: “We
have sinned, because we are not under the law but under grace.” <span
id="fr_2223"></span>[2224](#fn_2223) He then who is neither under grace,
because he has never climbed the heights of the Lord’s teaching, nor
under the law, because he has not accepted even those small commands of
the law, this man, ground down beneath a twofold rule of sin, fancies
that he has received the grace of Christ, simply and solely for this,
that by this dangerous liberty of his he may make himself none of His,
and falls into that state, which the Apostle Peter warns us to avoid,
saying: “Act as free, and not having your liberty as a cloak of
wickedness.” The blessed Apostle Paul also says: “For ye, brethren, were
called to liberty,” i.e., that ye might be free from the dominion of
sin, “only use not your liberty for an occasion of the flesh,” <span
id="fr_2224"></span>[2225](#fn_2224) i.e., believe that the doing away
with the commands of the law is a licence to sin. But this liberty, the
Apostle Paul teaches us is nowhere but where the Lord is dwelling, for
he says: “The Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is
there is liberty.” <span id="fr_2225"></span>[2226](#fn_2225) Wherefore
I know not whether I could express and explain the meaning of the
blessed Apostle, as those know how, who have experience; one thing I do
know, that it is very clearly revealed even without anyone’s explanation
to all those who have perfectly acquired <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxxiv-p5.2"></span>πρακτικὴ</span>, i.e., practical
training. For they will need no effort to understand in discussion what
they have already learnt by practice.
