#### <span id="iv.v.vii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.v.vii.ix-p1"></span>How to get rid even of spiritual
grounds of discord.

<span id="iv.v.vii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.ix-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> for the preservation of
lasting and unbroken love, it is of no use to have removed the first
ground of discord, which generally arises from frail and earthly things,
or to have disregarded all carnal things, and to have permitted to our
brethren an unrestricted share in everything which our needs require,
unless too we cut off in like manner the second, which generally arises
under the guise of spiritual feelings; and unless we gain in everything
humble thoughts and harmonious wills.
