<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.x.xxviii-p1"></A>A question about the fact that a plentiful supply of tears is not in our own power.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.x.xxviii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.x.xxviii-p2.1"></A>Germanus</span>: My own poor self indeed is not altogether ignorant of this feeling of conviction. For often when tears arise at the recollection of my faults, I have been by the Lord&#146;s visitation so refreshed by this ineffable joy which you describe that the greatness of the joy has assured me that I ought not to despair of their forgiveness. Than which state of mind I think there is nothing more sublime if only it could be recalled at our own will. For sometimes when I am desirous to stir myself up with all my power to the same conviction and tears, and place before my eyes all my faults and sins, I am unable to bring back that copiousness of tears, and so my eyes are dry and hard like some hardest flint, so that not a single tear trickles from them. And so in proportion as I congratulate myself on that copiousness of tears, just so do I mourn that I cannot bring it back again whenever I wish.</p>
