#### <span id="iv.iv.xi.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.iv.xi.iv-p1"></span>Of our return to Abbot Isaac and
question concerning the error into which the aforesaid old man had
fallen.

<span id="iv.iv.xi.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.xi.iv-p2.1"></span>Although</span> even besides the fresh
matter which has lately arisen, our delight in the former conference
which was held on the character of prayer would summon us to postpone
everything else and return to your holiness, yet this grievous error of
Abbot Sarapion, conceived, as we fancy, by the craft of most vile
demons, adds somewhat to this desire of ours. For it is no small despair
by which we are cast down when we consider that through the fault of
this ignorance he has not only utterly lost all those labours which he
has performed in so praiseworthy a manner for fifty years in this
desert, but has also incurred the risk of eternal death. And so we want
first to know why and wherefore so grievous an error has crept into him.
And next we should like to be taught how we can arrive at that condition
in prayer, of which you discoursed some time back not only fully but
splendidly. For that admirable Con<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>
<span id="iv.iv.xi.iv-Page_403"></span>ference has had this effect upon
us, that it has only dazzled our minds and has not shown us how to
perform or secure it.
