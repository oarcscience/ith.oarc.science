#### <span id="iv.vii.vii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xxi-p1"></span>The authority of Holy Scripture
teaches that Christ existed from all eternity.

<span id="iv.vii.vii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vii.xxi-p2.1"></span>And</span> yet to return to what we said
before, though all these things are so, as we have stated: how do we
read that Jesus Christ (whom you assert to be a mere man) was ever
existing even before His birth of a Virgin, and how is He proclaimed by
prophets and apostles as God even before the worlds? As Paul says: “One
Lord Jesus, through whom are all things.” <span
id="fr_2578"></span>[2579](#fn_2578) And elsewhere he says: “For in
Christ were created all things in heaven and on earth, both visible and
invisible.” <span id="fr_2579"></span>[2580](#fn_2579) The <span
id="page_602">p. 602</span> <span
id="iv.vii.vii.xxi-Page_602"></span>Creed too, which is framed both by
human and Divine authority, says: “I believe in God the Father, and in
the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son.” And after other clauses: “Very God of
Very God; by whom both the worlds were framed and all things were made.”
And further: “Who for us came and was born of the Virgin Mary, and was
crucified, and was buried.”
