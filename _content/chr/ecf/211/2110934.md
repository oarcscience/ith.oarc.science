#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xiv-p1"></span>The discourse of the Elder showing
how the plan of action may be changed without fault provided that one
keeps to the carrying out of a good intention.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Joseph</span>: As we premised, the intent
of the mind brings a man either reward or condemnation, according to
this passage: “Their thoughts between themselves accusing or also
defending one another, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of
men;” and this too: “But I am coming to gather together their works and
thoughts together with all nations and tongues.” <span
id="fr_2018"></span>[2019](#fn_2018) Wherefore it was, as I see, from a
desire for perfection that you bound yourselves with the chain of these
oaths, as you then thought that by this plan it could be gained, while
now that a riper judgment has supervened, you see that you cannot by
this means scale its heights. And so any departure from that
arrangement, which may seem to have happened, will be no hindrance, if
only no change in that first purpose follows. For a change of instrument
does not imply a desertion of the work, nor does the choice of a shorter
and more direct road argue laziness on the path of the traveller. And so
in this matter an improvement in a short-sighted arrangement is not to
be reckoned a breach of a spiritual promise. For whatever is done out of
the love of God and desire for goodness, which has “promise of the life
that now is and of that which is to come,” <span
id="fr_2019"></span>[2020](#fn_2019) even though it may appear to
commence with a hard and adverse beginning, is most worthy, not only of
no blame, but actually of praise. And therefore the breaking of a
careless promise will be no hindrance, if in every case the end, i.e.,
the proposed aim at goodness, be maintained. For we do all for this
reason, that we may be able to show to God a clean heart, and if the
attainment of this is considered to be easier in this country the
alteration of the agreement extracted from you will be no hindrance to
you, if only the perfection of that purity for the sake of which your
promise was originally made, be the sooner secured according to the
Lord’s will.
