#### <span id="iv.v.ii.vi-p0.1"></span>Chapter VI.

<span id="iv.v.ii.vi-p1"></span>Abbot Chæremon’s statement that faults
can be overcome in three ways.

<span id="iv.v.ii.vi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.vi-p2.1"></span>Then</span> the blessed Chæremon: There are,
said he, three things which enable men to control their faults; viz.,
either the fear of hell or of laws even now imposed; or the hope and
desire of the kingdom of heaven; or a liking for goodness itself and the
love of virtue. For then we read that the fear of evil loathes
contamination: “The fear of the Lord hateth evil.” <span
id="fr_1690"></span>[1691](#fn_1690) Hope also shuts out the assaults of
all faults: for “all who hope in Him shall not fail.” <span
id="fr_1691"></span>[1692](#fn_1691) Love also fears no destruction from
sins, for “love never faileth;” <span
id="fr_1692"></span>[1693](#fn_1692) and again: “love covers a multitude
of sins.” <span id="fr_1693"></span>[1694](#fn_1693) And therefore the
blessed Apostle confines the whole <span id="page_417">p. 417</span>
<span id="iv.v.ii.vi-Page_417"></span>sum of salvation in the attainment
of those three virtues, saying “Now abideth faith, hope, love, these
three.” <span id="fr_1694"></span>[1695](#fn_1694) For faith is what
makes us shun the stains of sin from fear of future judgment and
punishment; hope is what withdraws our mind from present things, and
despises all bodily pleasures from its expectation of heavenly rewards;
love is what inflames us with keenness of heart for the love of Christ
and the fruit of spiritual goodness, and makes us hate with a perfect
hatred whatever is opposed to these. And these three things although
they all seem to aim at one and the same end (for they incite us to
abstain from things unlawful) yet they differ from each other greatly in
the degrees of their excellence. For the two former belong properly to
those men who in their aim at goodness have not yet acquired the love of
virtue, and the third belongs specially to God and to those who have
received into themselves the image and likeness of God. For He alone
does the things that are good, with no fear and no thanks or reward to
stir Him up, but simply from the love of goodness. For, as Solomon says,
“The Lord hath made all things for Himself.” <span
id="fr_1695"></span>[1696](#fn_1695) For under cover of His own goodness
He bestows all the fulness of good things on the worthy and the unworthy
because He cannot be wearied by wrongs, nor be moved by passions at the
sins of men, as He ever remains perfect goodness and unchangeable in His
nature.
