#### <span id="iv.v.v.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.v.v.i-p1"></span>The words of Abbot Nesteros on the
knowledge of the religious.

<span id="iv.v.v.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.i-p2.1"></span>The</span> order of our promise and course
demands that there should follow the instruction of Abbot
Nesteros, <span id="fr_1864"></span>[1865](#fn_1864) a man of excellence
in all points and of the greatest knowledge: who when he had seen that
we had committed some parts of Holy Scripture to memory and desired to
understand them, addressed us in these words. There are indeed many
different kinds of knowledge in this world, since there is as great a
variety of them as there is of the arts and sciences. But, while all are
either utterly useless or only useful for the good of this present life,
there is yet none which has not its own system and method for learning
it, by which it can be grasped by those who seek it. If then those arts
are guided by certain special rules for their publication, how much more
does the system and expression of our religion, which tends to the
contemplation of the secrets of invisible mysteries, and seeks no
present gain but the reward of an eternal recompense, depend on a fixed
order and scheme. And the knowledge of this is twofold: first, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.v.v.i-p3.3"></span>πρακτική</span>, i.e.,
practical, which is brought about by an improvement of morals and
purification from faults: secondly, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.v.v.i-p3.4"></span>θεωρητική</span>, which consists in the
contemplation of things Divine and the knowledge of most sacred
thoughts.

<span id="iv.v.v.i-p3"></span> Nesteros. In the Vitæ Patrum there are
some stories of one or two of this name (for it is not quite clear
whether they are distinct persons or one and the same to whom the
stories refer). One was known as <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.v.v.i-p3.1"></span>ὁ</span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.v.v.i-p3.2"></span>μέγας</span>, and was a friend of St. Antony,
and is supposed by some to be the same whose Conferences Cassian here
relates, but nothing certain is known of him.
