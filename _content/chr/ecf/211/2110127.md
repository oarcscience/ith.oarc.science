#### <span id="ii.v.ii.xix-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIX.

<span id="ii.v.ii.xix-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.xix-p1.1"></span>When</span> you repeat <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225) a psalm, consider whose words you are
repeating and delight yourself more with true contrition of soul, than
with the pleasantness of a trilling voice. For God sets a higher value
on the tears of one thus praising <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226) him, than on the beauty of his voice;
as the prophet says, “Serve <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227) the
Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.” Now, where there are fear
and trembling, there is no lifting up of the voice, but humility of mind
with lamentation and tears. Display diligence in all thy doings; for it
is written, “Cursed <span id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228) is the man
who carelessly performs the work of the Lord.” Let grace grow in you
with years; let righteousness increase with age; and let your faith
appear the more perfect the older you become; for Jesus, who has left us
an example how to live, increased not only in years as respected his
body, but in wisdom and spiritual grace before God and men. Reckon all
the time in which you do not perceive yourself growing better as
positively lost. Maintain to the last that purpose of virginity which
you have formed; for it is the part of virtue not merely to begin, but
to finish, as the Lord says in the Gospel, “Whosoever <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229) shall endure to the end, the same
shall be saved.” Beware, therefore, lest you furnish to any one an
occasion even of evil desire, because thy God, betrothed to thee, is
jealous; for an adulteress against Christ is more guilty than one
against her husband. Be thou, therefore, a model of life to all; be an
example; and excel in actual conduct those whom you precede in your
consecration <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230) to chastity. Show
thyself in all respects a virgin; and let no stain of corruption be
brought as a charge against thy person. And let one whose body is
perfect in its purity be also irreproachable in conduct. Now, as we said
in the beginning of this letter, that you have become a sacrifice
pertaining to God, such a sacrifice as undoubtedly imparts its own
sanctity also to others, that, as every one worthily receives from it,
he himself also may be a partaker of sanctification, so then, let the
other virgins also be sanctified through you, as by means of a divine
offering. Show yourself to them so holy in all things, that, whosoever
comes in contact with thy life, whether by hearing or seeing, may
experience the power of sanctification, and may feel that such an amount
of grace passes to him from your manner of acting, that, while he
desires to imitate thee, he himself becomes worthy of being a sacrifice
devoted to God.
