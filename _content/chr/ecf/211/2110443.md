#### <span id="iv.iii.vii.xxvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVII.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxvii-p1"></span>Scripture proofs by which one who
is aiming at perfection is taught not to take back again what he has
given up and renounced.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.xxvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.xxvii-p2.1"></span>If</span> then through the desire of
perfection you have forsaken all things and followed Christ who says to
thee, “Go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have treasure in heaven: and come follow me,” <span
id="fr_904"></span>[905](#fn_904) why, having put your hand to the
plough, do you look back, so that you will be declared by the voice of
the same Lord not to be fit for the kingdom of heaven? <span
id="fr_905"></span>[906](#fn_905) When secure on the top of the gospel
roof, why do you descend to carry away something from the house, from
those things, namely, which beforetime you despised? When you are out in
the field and working at the virtues, why do you run back and try to
clothe yourself again with what belongs to this world, which you
stripped off when you renounced it? <span
id="fr_906"></span>[907](#fn_906) But if you were hindered by poverty
from having anything to give up, still less ought you to amass what you
never had before. For by the grace of the Lord you were for this purpose
made ready that you might hasten to him the more readily, being hampered
by no snares of wealth. But let no one who is wanting in this be
disappointed; for there is no one who has not something to give up. He
has renounced all the possessions of this world, whoever has thoroughly
eradicated the desire to possess them.
