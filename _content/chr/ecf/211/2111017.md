#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xvii-p1"></span>Of the reason for fasting and its
value.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xvii-p2.1"></span>So</span> then let us constantly remember
this description of the character of fasting, and always aim at it with
all the powers of the soul, in such a way as to recognize that then only
is it suitable for us if in it we preserve regard for time, its
character and degree, and this not so as to set the end of our hope upon
it, but so that by it we may succeed in attaining to purity of heart and
Apostolical love. Therefore from this it is clear that fasting, for
which not only are there special seasons appointed at which it should be
practised or relaxed, but conditions and rules also laid down, is not
good in its own nature, but something indifferent. But those things
which are either enjoined as good by the authority of a precept, or are
forbidden as bad, are never subject to any exceptions of time in such a
way that sometimes we should do what is forbidden or omit what is
commanded. For there is no limit set to justice, patience, soberness,
modesty, love, nor on the other hand is a licence ever granted for
injustice, impatience, wrath, immodesty, envy, and pride.
