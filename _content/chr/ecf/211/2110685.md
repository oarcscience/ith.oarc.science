#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.xxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXII.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxii-p1"></span>How it was that God foretold to
Abraham that Israel would have to drive out ten nations.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.xxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.xxii-p2.1"></span>When</span> the Lord was speaking with
Abraham about the future (a point which you did not ask about) we find
that He did not enumerate seven nations, but ten, whose land He promised
to give to his seed. <span id="fr_1355"></span>[1356](#fn_1355) And this
number is plainly made up by adding idolatry, and blasphemy, to whose
dominion, before the knowledge of God and the grace of Baptism, both the
irreligious hosts of the Gentiles and blasphemous ones of the Jews were
subject, while they dwelt in a spiritual Egypt. But when a man has made
his renunciation and come forth from thence, and having by God’s grace
conquered gluttony, has come into the spiritual wilderness, then he is
free from the attacks of these three, and will only have to wage war
against those seven which Moses enumerates.
