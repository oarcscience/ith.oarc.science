#### <span id="iv.vii.v.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.vii.v.viii-p1"></span>How this interchange of titles does
not interfere with His Divine power.

<span id="iv.vii.v.viii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.v.viii-p2.1"></span>For</span> certainly when the evangelist
says that He came into the world by whom the world itself was made, and
that He was made the Son of man, who is as God the creator of the world,
it makes no difference what particular title is used, as God in all
cases is meant. For His condescension and will do not interfere with His
Divinity, since they the rather prove His Divinity, because whatever He
willed came to pass. Therefore also because He willed it, He came into
the world; and because He willed it, He was born a man; and because He
willed it, He was termed the Son of man. For just as there are so many
words, so are they powers belonging to God. The variety of names in Him
does not take anything away from the efficacy of His power. Whatever may
be the names given Him, in all cases it is one and the same Person.
Though there may be some variety in the appearance of His titles, yet
there is but a single Divine Person (Majestas) meant by all the names.
