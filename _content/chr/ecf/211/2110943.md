decision is unreasonable.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xxiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xxiii-p2.1"></span>Joseph</span>: There is no doubt that
these are the decisions of those monasteries in which the infancy of
your renunciation was, as you tell us, trained, as their leaders are
accustomed to prefer their own will to their brother’s supper, and most
obstinately stick to what they have once intended. But our Elders, to
whose faith the signs of Apostolical powers have borne witness, and who
have treated everything with judgment and discretion of spirit rather
than with stiff obstinacy of mind, have laid down that those men who
give in to the infirmities of others, receive much richer fruits than
those who persist in their determinations, and have declared that it is
a better deed to conceal abstinence, as was said, by this needful and
humble lie, rather than to display it with a proud show of truth.
