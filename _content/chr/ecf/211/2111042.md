#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.iv-p1"></span>How man’s goodness and righteousness
are not good if compared with the goodness and righteousness of God.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.iv-p2.1"></span>But</span> if we want also to establish
the force of this opinion by still clearer proofs, is it not the case
that while we read of many things as called good in the gospel, as a
good tree, and good treasure, and a good man, and a good servant, for He
says: “A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit;” and: “a good man out
of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things;” and: “Well
done, good and faithful servant;” <span
id="fr_2239"></span>[2240](#fn_2239) and certainly there can be no doubt
that none of these are good in themselves, yet if we take into
consideration the goodness of God, none of them will be called good, as
the Lord says: “None is good save God alone”? <span
id="fr_2240"></span>[2241](#fn_2240) In whose sight even the apostles
themselves, who in the excellence of their calling in many ways went
beyond the goodness of mankind, are said to be evil, as the Lord thus
speaks to them: “If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to
your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give
good things to them that ask Him.” <span
id="fr_2241"></span>[2242](#fn_2241) Finally as our goodness turns to
badness in the eyes of the Highest so also our righteousness when set
against the Divine righteousness is considered like a menstruous cloth,
as Isaiah the prophet says: “All your righteousness is like a menstruous
cloth.” <span id="fr_2242"></span>[2243](#fn_2242) And to produce
something still plainer, even the vital precepts of the law itself,
which are said to have been “given by angels by the hand of a mediator,”
and of which the same Apostle says: “So the law indeed is holy and the
commandment is holy and just and good,” <span
id="fr_2243"></span>[2244](#fn_2243) when they are compared with the
perfection of the gospel are pronounced anything but good by the Divine
oracle: for He says: “And I gave them precepts that were not good, and
ordinances whereby they should not live in them.” <span
id="fr_2244"></span>[2245](#fn_2244) The Apostle also affirms that the
glory of the law is so dimmed by the light of the New Testament that he
declares that in comparison with the splendour of the gospel it is not
to be considered glorious, saying: “For even that which was glorious was
not glorified by reason of the glory that excelleth.” <span
id="fr_2245"></span>[2246](#fn_2245) And Scripture keeps up this
comparison on the other side also, i.e., in weighing the merits of
sinners, so that in comparison with the wicked it justifies those who
have sinned less, saying: “Sodom is justified above thee;” and again:
“For what hath thy sister Sodom sinned?” and: “The rebellious Israel
hath justified her soul in comparison of the treacherous Judah.” <span
id="fr_2246"></span>[2247](#fn_2246) So then the merits of all the
virtues, which I enumerated above, though in themselves they are good
and precious, yet become dim in comparison of the brightness of
contemplation. For they greatly hinder and retard the saints who are
taken up with earthly aims even at good works, from the contemplation of
that sublime good.
