<span id="ii.v.ii.xi"></span>

#### <span id="ii.v.ii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="ii.v.ii.xi-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>I believe</span> that I have now set forth,
briefly indeed, but, at the same time, fully, what is implied in a
woman’s purity of body: it remains that we should learn what it is to be
pure also in spirit; i.e. that what it is unlawful for one to do in act,
it is also unlawful for one even to imagine in thought. For she is holy,
alike in body and in spirit, who sins neither in mind nor heart, knowing
that God is one who examines also the heart; and, therefore, she takes
every pains to possess a mind as well as a body free from sin. Such a
person is aware that it is written, “Keep thy <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198) heart with all diligence”; and again,
“God loveth <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199) holy hearts, and all
the undefiled are acceptable to him”; and elsewhere, “Blessed <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200) are those of a pure heart; for they
shall see God.” I think that this last statement is made regarding those
whom conscience accuses of the guilt of no sin; concerning whom I think
that John also spoke in his Epistle when he said, “If our heart <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201) condemn us not, then have we
confidence towards God, and whatsoever we ask we shall receive from
him.” I do not wish you to think that you have escaped the accusation of
sin, although act does not follow desire, since it is written,
“Whosoever <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202) looketh on a woman to
lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.”
And do not say, “I had the thought, indeed, but I did not carry it out
in act”; for it is unlawful even to desire that which it is unlawful to
do. Wherefore also blessed Peter issues a precept to this effect:
“purify your <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203) souls”; and if he
had not been aware of such a thing as defilement of the soul, he would
not have expressed a desire that it should be purified. But we should
also very carefully consider that passage which says, “These <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204) are they who did not defile themselves
with women, for they remained virgins, and they follow the Lamb
whithersoever he goeth”; and should reflect whether, if these are joined
to the Divine retinue, and traverse all the regions of the heavens,
through the merit of chastity and purity alone, there may be also other
means by which virginity being assisted may attain to the <span
id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span id="ii.v.ii.xi-Page_64"></span>glory of
so great blessedness. But whence shall we be able to know this? From the
following passages (if I mistake not) in which it is written, “These
were <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205) purchased from among men as
the first fruits to God and the Lamb, and in their mouth there was found
no falsehood, for they are without spot before the throne of God.” You
see, then, that they are spoken of as closely following in the footsteps
of the Lord, not in virtue of one member only, but those are said to do
so, who, besides virginity, had passed a life freed from all the
pollution of sin. Wherefore, let the virgin especially despise marriage
on this account, that, while she is safer than others, she may the more
easily accomplish what is also required from those who are married; viz.
keep herself from all sin, and obey all the commandments of the law. For
if she does not marry, and nevertheless indulges in those things from
which even married women are enjoined to keep themselves free, what will
it profit her not to have married? For although it is not allowed to any
Christian to commit sin, and it befits all without exception who are
purified through the sanctification of the spiritual bath, to lead an
unstained life, that they may be thoroughly identified <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206) with the Church, which is described as
being “without <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207) spot, or wrinkle,
or any such thing,” much more is it requisite that a virgin should reach
this standard, whom neither the existence of a husband, nor of sons, nor
of any other necessity, prevents from fully carrying out the demands of
holy Scripture; nor shall she be able, if she fail, to defend herself by
any sort of excuse.
