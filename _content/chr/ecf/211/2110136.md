#### <span id="ii.vi.i.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="ii.vi.i.ii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.ii-p1.1"></span>The</span> world was created by God nearly
six <span id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247) thousand years ago, as we
shall set forth in the course of this book; although those who have
entered upon and published a calculation of the dates, but little agree
among themselves. As, however, this disagreement is due either to the
will of God or to the fault of antiquity, it ought not to be a matter of
censure. After the formation of the world man was created, the male
being named Adam, and the female Eve. Having been placed in Paradise,
they ate of the tree from which they were interdicted, and therefore
were cast forth as exiles into our earth. <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248) To them were born Cain and Abel; but
Cain, being an impious man, slew his brother. He had a son called Enoch,
by whom a city was first built, <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249)
and was called after the name of its founder. From him Irad, and from
him again Maüiahel was descended. He had a son called Mathusalam, and
he, in turn, begat Lamech, by whom a young man is said to have been
slain, without, however, the name of the slain man being mentioned—a
fact which is thought by the wise to have presaged a future mystery.
Adam, then, after the death of his younger son, begat another son called
Seth, when he was now two hundred and thirty years old: he lived
altogether eight hundred and thirty years. Seth begat Enos, Enos Cainan,
Cainan Malaleel, Malaleel Jared, and Jared Enoch, who on account of his
righteousness is said to have been translated by God. His son was called
Mathusalam who begat Lamech; from whom Noah was descended, remarkable
for his righteousness, and above all other mortals dear and acceptable
to God. When by this time the human race had increased to a great
multitude, certain angels, whose habitation was in heaven, were
captivated by the appearance of some beautiful virgins, and cherished
illicit desires after them, so much so, that falling beneath their own
proper nature and origin, they left the higher regions of which they
<span id="page_72">p. 72</span> <span
id="ii.vi.i.ii-Page_72"></span>were inhabitants, and allied themselves
in earthly marriages. These angels gradually spreading wicked habits,
corrupted the human family, and from their alliance giants are said to
have sprung, for the mixture with them of beings of a different nature,
as a matter of course, gave birth to monsters.

id="ii.vi.i.ii-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.ii-p2"></span> Sulpitius follows the Greek version,
which ascribes many more years to the fathers of mankind than does the
original Hebrew.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[71:249](2110136.htm#fr_248) <span
id="ii.vi.i.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.ii-p3"></span> Many of the ancients (among whom our
author is apparently to be reckoned) believed that Paradise was situated
outside our world altogether.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[71:250](2110136.htm#fr_249) <span
id="ii.vi.i.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.ii-p4"></span> An obvious mistake. The first city was
built, not by Enoch but by Cain. [Gen. iv.
17](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#017)<span id="ii.vi.i.ii-p4.1"></span>.
