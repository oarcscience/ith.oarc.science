#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ix-p1"></span>The case of Job who was tempted by the
devil and of the Lord who was betrayed by Judas: and how prosperity as
well as adversity is advantageous to a good man.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.ix-p2.1"></span>For</span> the patience of Job did not
bring any gain to the devil, through making him a better man by his
temptations, but only to Job himself who endured them bravely; nor was
Judas granted freedom from eternal punishment, because his act of
betrayal contributed to the salvation of mankind. For we must not regard
the result of the deed, but the purpose of the doer. Wherefore we should
always cling to this assertion; viz., that evil cannot be brought upon a
man by another, unless a man has admitted it by his sloth or feebleness
of heart: as the blessed Apostle confirms this opinion of ours in a
verse of Scripture: “But we know that all things work together for good
to them that love God.” <span id="fr_1386"></span>[1387](#fn_1386) But
by saying “All things work together for good,” he includes everything
alike, not only things fortunate, but also those which seem to be
misfortunes: through which the Apostle tells us in another place that he
himself has passed, when he says: “By the armour of righteousness on the
right hand and on the left,” i.e., “Through honour and dishonour,
through evil report and good report, as deceivers and yet true, as
sorrowful but always rejoicing, as needy and yet enriching many:” <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1388](#fn_1387) All those things then which are
considered fortunate, and are called those “on the right hand,” which
the holy Apostle designates by the terms honour and good report; and
those too which are counted misfortunes, which he clearly means by
dishonour and evil report, and which he describes as “on the left hand,”
become to the perfect man “the armour of righteousness,” if when they
are brought upon him, he bears them bravely: because, as he fights with
these, and uses those very weapons with which he seems to be attacked,
and is protected by them as by bow and sword and stout shield against
those who bring these things upon him, he secures the advantage of his
patience and goodness, and obtains a grand triumph of steadfastness by
means of those very weapons of his enemies which are hurled against him
to kill him; and if only he is not elated by success or cast down by
failure, but ever marches straightforward on the king’s highway, and
does not swerve from that state of tranquillity as it were to the right
hand, when joy overcomes him, nor let himself be driven so to speak to
the left hand, when misfortunes overwhelm him, and sorrow holds sway.
For “Much peace have they that love Thy law, and to them there is no
stumbling block.” <span id="fr_1388"></span>[1389](#fn_1388) But of
those who shift about according to the character and changes of the
several chances which happen to them, we read: “But a fool will change
like the moon.” <span id="fr_1389"></span>[1390](#fn_1389) For just as
it is said of men who are perfect and wise: “To them that love God all
things work together for good,” <span
id="fr_1390"></span>[1391](#fn_1390) so of those who are weak and
foolish it is declared that “everything is against a foolish man,” <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[1392](#fn_1391) for he gets no profit out of
prosperity, nor does adversity make him any better. For it requires as
much goodness to bear sorrows bravely, as to be moderate in prosperity:
and it is quite certain that one who fails in one of these, will not
bear up under the other. But a man can be more easily overcome by
prosperity than by misfortunes: for these sometimes restrain men against
their will and make them humble and through most salutary sorrow cause
them to sin less, and make them better: while prosperity puffs up the
mind with soothing but most pernicious flatteries and when men are
secure in the prospect of their happiness dashes them to the ground with
a still greater destruction.
