<p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p1"></A>Of true and complete perfection.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2.1"></A>But</span> this is <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2.2"></A>&#956;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#8053;</span>, i.e., no thorough and altogether complete perfection, but only a partial one. Perfection then is very rare and granted by God&#146;s gift to but a very few. For he is truly and not partially perfect who with equal imperturbability can put up with the squalor of the wilderness in the desert, as well as the infirmities of the brethren in the C&#339;nobium. And so it is hard to find one who is perfect in both lives, because the anchorite cannot thoroughly acquire <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2.3"></A>&#7936;</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iv.vi.iii.ix-p2.4"></A>&#954;&#964;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;</span> , i.e., a disregard for and stripping oneself of material things, nor the C&#339;nobite purity in contemplation, although we know that Abbot Moses and Paphnutius and the two Macarii&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2113"></A><A HREF="#fn_2113"><FONT SIZE="1">2114</FONT></A>
 were masters of both in perfection. And so they were perfect in either life, and while they withdrew further than all the dwellers in the desert and delighted themselves unceasingly in the retirement of the wilderness, and as far as in them lay never sought intercourse with other men, yet they put up with the presence and the infirmities of those who came to them so that when a large number of the brethren came to them for the sake of seeing them and profiting by it, they endured this almost continuous trouble of receiving them with imperturbable patience, and men fancied that all the days of their life they had neither learnt nor practised anything but how to show common civility to those who came, so that it was a puzzle to all to say in which life their zeal was mainly shown, i.e., whether their greatness adapted itself more remarkably to the purity of the hermitage or to the common life.</p>
