#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.xx-p0.1"></span>Chapter XX.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xx-p1"></span>Of the way in which auger should be
banished according to the gospel.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xx-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.xx-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> if we wish to gain the
substance of that divine reward of which it is said, “Blessed are the
pure in heart, for they shall see God,” <span
id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945) we ought not only to banish it from
our actions, but entirely to root it out from our inmost soul. For it
will not be of any good to have checked anger in words, and not to have
shown it in deeds, if God, from whom the secrets of the heart are not
hid, sees that it remains in the secret recesses of our bosom. For the
word of the gospel bids us destroy the roots of our faults rather than
the fruits; for these, when the incitements are all removed, will
certainly not put forth shoots any more; and so the mind will be able to
continue in all patience and holiness, when this anger has been removed,
not from the surface of acts and deeds, but from the very innermost
thoughts. And, therefore to avoid the commission of murder, anger and
hatred are cut off, without which the crime of murder cannot possibly be
committed. For “whosoever is angry with his brother, is in danger of the
judgment;” <span id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946) and “whosoever hateth
his brother is a murderer;” <span id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947)
viz., because in his heart he desires to kill him, whose blood we know
that he has certainly not shed among men with his own hand or with a
weapon; yet, owing to his burst of anger, he is declared to be a
murderer by God, who renders to each man, not merely for the result of
his actions, but for his purpose and desires and wishes, either a reward
or a punishment; according to that which He Himself says through the
prophet: “But I come that I may gather them together with all nations
and tongues;” <span id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948) and again: <span
id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949) “Their thoughts between themselves
accusing or also defending one another, in the day when God shall judge
the secrets of men.” <span id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950)
