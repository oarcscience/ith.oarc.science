<span id="iv.iii.ix.iv-p1"></span>Whence and in what way dejection
arises.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ix.iv-p2.1"></span>But</span> sometimes it is found to result
from the fault of previous anger, or to spring from the desire of some
gain which has not been realized, when a man has found that he has
failed in his hope of securing those things which he had planned. But
sometimes without any apparent reason for our being driven to fall into
this misfortune, we are by the instigation of our crafty enemy suddenly
depressed with so great a gloom that we cannot receive with ordinary
civility the visits of those who are near and dear to us; and whatever
subject of conversation is started by them, we regard it as ill-timed
and out of place; and we can give them no civil answer, as the gall of
bitterness is in possession of every corner of our heart.

of other people, but by our own.](2110476)
