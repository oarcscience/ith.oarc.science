#### <span id="iv.iii.xi.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.xiv-p1"></span>How it suggests that a man may seek
to take holy orders.

<span id="iv.iii.xi.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xi.xiv-p2.1"></span>But</span> sometimes it creates a wish to
take holy orders, and a desire for the priesthood or diaconate. And it
represents that if a man has even against his will received this office,
he will fulfil it with such sanctity and strictness that he will be able
to set an example of saintliness even to other priests; and that he will
win over many people, not only by his manner of life, but also by his
teaching and preaching. It makes a man, even when alone and sitting in
his cell, to go round in mind and imagination to the dwellings and
monasteries of others, and to make many conversions under the
inducements of imaginary exultation.
