#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.xiv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIV.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xiv-p1"></span>A question how such wrong notions
can creep into us.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.xiv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.xiv-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: Very aptly has your
discussion shown the error of these illusions by this illustration: but
we should like in the same way to be taught its origin and how to cure
it, and we are equally anxious to learn how this deception has taken
hold of us. For everybody must see that no one at all can apply remedies
to ill health except one who has already diagnosed the actual origin of
the disease.
