#### <span id="iv.vi.v.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.vi.v.i-p1"></span>How Theonas came to Abbot John.

<span id="iv.vi.v.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.i-p2.1"></span>Before</span> we begin to set forth the words
of this Conference held with that excellent man Abbot Theonas, <span
id="fr_2157"></span>[2158](#fn_2157) I think it well to describe in a
brief discourse the origin of his conversion because from this the
reader will be able to see more clearly both the excellence and the
grace of the man. He then while still very young was by the desire and
command of his parents joined in the tie of marriage, for as with pious
anxiety they were careful about his chastity, and were afraid of a
critical fall at a dangerous age, they thought that the passions of
youth might be anticipated by the remedy of a lawful marriage. When then
he had lived for five years with a wife, he came to Abbot John, who was
then for his marvellous sanctity chosen to preside over the
administration of the alms. <span id="fr_2158"></span>[2159](#fn_2158)
For it is not anyone who likes who is of his own wish or ambition
promoted to this office, but only he whom the congregation of all the
Elders considers from the advantage of his age and the witness of his
faith and virtues to be more excellent than, and superior to, all
others. To this blessed John then the aforesaid young man had come in
the eagerness of his pious devotion, bringing gifts of piety among other
owners who were eager to offer tithes and first-fruits of their
substance to the old man I mentioned, <span
id="fr_2159"></span>[2160](#fn_2159) and when the old man saw them
pouring in upon him with many gifts, and was anxious to make some
recompense in return for their offerings, he began, as the Apostle says,
to sow spiritual things to them whose carnal gifts he was reaping. <span
id="fr_2160"></span>[2161](#fn_2160) And finally thus began his word of
exhortation.

<span id="iv.vi.v.i-p3"></span> Nothing further is known of this Theonas
than what Cassian here tells us: he is clearly a different person from
the one mentioned by Rufinus, Hist. Mon. c. vi. Cf. Palladius, Lausiac
History, c. l.

<span id="iv.vi.v.i-p5"></span> This is noteworthy as being the earliest
instance on record of the payment of tithes to a monastery. The language
of the Conference, it will be noted, shows that they were not regarded
as legally due or in any way compulsory, but as a free-will offering on
the part of the faithful. Cf. Bingham, Antiquities, Book VII. ciii. §
19; and the Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, Vol. ii. p. 1964.
