<span id="iv.iii.vii.x-p1"></span>Of the toils which a deserter from a
monastery must undergo through covetousness, though he used formerly to
murmur at the very slightest tasks.

<span id="iv.iii.vii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.vii.x-p2.1"></span>And</span> so he is driven about, and more
and more inflamed with the love of his money, which when it is acquired,
never allows a monk either to remain in a monastery or to live under the
discipline of a rule. And when separating him like some wild beast from
the rest of the herd, it has made him through want of companions an
animal fit for prey, and caused him to be easily eaten up, as he is
deprived of fellow lodgers, it forces him, who once thought it beneath
him to perform the slight duties of the monastery, to labour without
stopping night and day, through hope of gain; it suffers him to keep no
services of prayer, no system of fasting, no rule of vigils; it does not
allow him to fulfil the duties of seemly intercession, if only he can
satisfy the madness of avarice, and supply his daily wants; inflaming
the more the fire of covetousness, while believing that it will be
extinguished by getting.
