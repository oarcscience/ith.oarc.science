#### <span id="ii.v.i.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="ii.v.i.ii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.i.ii-p1.1"></span>But</span> because you have desired from me
in all my letters which I had sent to you precepts to nourish your life
and faith, it has come to pass that, through the frequency of my
writings to you, I have now exhausted language of that kind; and I can
really write nothing new to you, so as to avoid what I have written
before. And in truth, through the goodness of God, you do not now need
to be exhorted, inasmuch as, perfecting your faith at the very beginning
of your saintly life, you display a devoted love in Christ. One thing,
however, I do press upon you, that you do not go back on things you have
already passed away from, that you do not long again for things you have
already scorned, and that, having put your hand to the plow, you do not
look back <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140) again, retracing your
steps; for, undoubtedly, by falling into this fault, your furrow will
lose its straightness, and the cultivator will not receive his own
proper reward. Moreover, he does not secure even a measure of the
reward, if he has, in a measure, failed. For, as we must flee from sin
to righteousness, so he who has entered on the practice of righteousness
must beware lest he lay himself open to sin. For it is written that “his
righteousness shall not profit the righteous on the day on which he has
gone astray.” <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141) For this, then, we
must take our stand, for this we must labor, that we, who have escaped
from sins, do not lose the prepared rewards. For the enemy stands ready
against us, that he may at once strike the man who has been stripped of
the shield of faith. Our shield, therefore, is not to be cast aside,
lest our side be exposed to attack; and our sword is not to be put away,
lest the enemy then begin to give up all fear: moreover, we know that if
he sees a man fully armed, he will retreat. Nor are we ignorant that it
is a hard and difficult thing daily to fight against the flesh and the
world. But if you reflect upon eternity, and if you consider the kingdom
of heaven, which undoubtedly the Lord will condescend to bestow upon us
although we are sinners, what suffering, I ask, is sufficiently great,
by which we may merit such things? And besides, our struggle in this
world is but for a short time; for although death do not speedily
overtake us, old <span id="page_56">p. 56</span> <span
id="ii.v.i.ii-Page_56"></span>age will come. The years flow on, and time
glides by; while, as I hope, the Lord Jesus will speedily call us to
himself, as being dear to his heart.
