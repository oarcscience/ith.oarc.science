#### <span id="iv.iv.xi.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.iv.xi.vii-p1"></span>What constitutes our end and perfect
bliss.

<span id="iv.iv.xi.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.xi.vii-p2.1"></span>For</span> then will be perfectly
fulfilled in our case that prayer of our Saviour in which He prayed for
His disciples to the Father saying “that the love wherewith Thou lovedst
Me may be in them and they in us;” and again: “that they all may be one
as Thou, Father, in Me and I in Thee, that they also may be one in
us,” <span id="fr_1669"></span>[1670](#fn_1669) when that perfect love
of God, wherewith “He first loved us” <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[1671](#fn_1670) has passed into the feelings of our
heart as well, by the fulfilment of this prayer of the Lord which we
believe cannot possibly be ineffectual. And this will come to pass when
God shall be all our love, and every desire and wish and effort, every
thought of ours, and all our life and words and breath, and that unity
which already exists between the Father and the Son, and the Son and the
Father, has been shed abroad in our hearts and minds, so that as He
loves us with a pure and unfeigned and indissoluble love, so we also may
be joined to Him by a lasting and inseparable affection, since we are so
united to Him that whatever we breathe or think, or speak is God, since,
as I say, we attain to that end of which we spoke before, which the same
Lord in His prayer hopes may be fulfilled in us: “that they all may be
one as we are one, I in them and Thou in Me, that they also may be made
perfect in one;” and again: “Father, those whom Thou hast given Me, I
will that where I am, they may also be with Me.” <span
id="fr_1671"></span>[1672](#fn_1671) This then ought to be the
destination of the solitary, this should be all his aim that it may be
vouchsafed to him to possess even in the body an image of future bliss,
and that he may begin in this world to have a foretaste of a sort of
earnest of that celestial life and glory. This, I say, is the end of all
perfection, that the mind purged from all carnal desires may daily be
lifted towards spiritual things, until the whole life and all the
thoughts of the heart become one continuous prayer.
