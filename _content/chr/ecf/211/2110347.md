#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xviii-p1"></span>How it is against the rule for any
one to take anything to eat or drink except at the common table.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xviii-p2.1"></span>In</span> between their regular meals
in common they are especially careful that no one should presume to
gratify his palate with any food: <span
id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774) so that when they are walking casually
through gardens or orchards, when the fruit hanging enticingly on the
trees not only knocks against their breasts as they pass through, but is
also lying on the ground and offering itself to be trampled under foot,
and (as it is all ready to be gathered) would easily be able to entice
those who see it to gratify their appetite, and by the chance offered to
them and the quantity of the fruit, to excite even the most severe and
abstemious to long for it; still they consider it wrong not merely to
taste a single fruit, but even to touch one with the hand, except what
is put on the table openly for the common meal of all, and supplied
publicly by the steward’s catering through the service of the brethren,
for their enjoyment.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xviii-p3"></span> Similarly we find in the Rule of
Pachomius that no one is allowed to keep any food in his cell besides
what he receives from the steward (c. lxxix.): and the Benedictine Rule
also says: “Let no one presume to take any food or drink out of the
regular hours of meals” (c. xliii). Cf. also the Rule of Pachomius cc.
lxxv. and lxxviii., S. Basil’s longer Monastic Rules Q. xv., <span
