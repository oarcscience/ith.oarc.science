#### <span id="iv.iii.viii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.ii-p1"></span>Of those who say that anger is not
injurious, if we are angry with those who do wrong, since God Himself is
said to be angry.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.viii.ii-p2.1"></span>We</span> have heard some people trying
to excuse this most pernicious disease of the soul, in such a way as to
endeavour to extenuate it by a rather shocking way of interpreting
Scripture: as they say that it is not injurious if we are angry with the
brethren who do wrong, since, say they, God Himself is said to rage and
to be angry with those who either will not know Him, or, knowing Him,
spurn Him, as here: “And the anger of the Lord was kindled against His
people;” <span id="fr_917"></span>[918](#fn_917) or where the prophet
prays and says, “O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten
me in thy displeasure;” <span id="fr_918"></span>[919](#fn_918) not
understanding that, while they want to open to men an excuse for a most
pestilent sin, they are ascribing to the Divine Infinity and Fountain of
all purity a taint of human passion.
