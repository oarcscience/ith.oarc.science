#### <span id="iv.iii.ii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xvii-p1"></span>How he who rouses them for prayer
ought to call them at the usual time.

<span id="iv.iii.ii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ii.xvii-p2.1"></span>But</span> he who has been entrusted
with the office of summoning the religious assembly and with the care of
the service should not presume to rouse the brethren for their daily
vigils irregularly, as he pleases, or as he may wake up in the night, or
as the accident of his own sleep or sleeplessness may incline him. But,
although daily habit may constrain him to wake at the usual hour, yet by
often and anxiously ascertaining by the course of the stars the right
hour for service, he should summon them to the office of prayer, lest he
be found careless in one of two ways: either if, overcome with sleep, he
lets the proper hour of the night go by, or if, wanting to go to bed and
impatient for his sleep, he anticipates it, and so may be thought to
have secured is own repose instead of attending to the spiritual office
and the rest of all the others. <span id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710)

similarly careful that the brethren may not oversleep themselves. See c.
xi. and xlvii.
