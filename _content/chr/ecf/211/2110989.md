#### <span id="iv.vi.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.vi.iv.ii-p1"></span>Of our coming to him.

desire for holy instruction had urged us also to visit Egypt, we sought
him out with the utmost eagerness and devotion and were welcomed by him
with such kindness and courtesy that he actually honoured us, as former
sharers of the same cell with him, with a lodging in his own cell which
he had built in the furthest corner of his garden. And there when in the
presence of all the brethren at service he had delivered to one of the
brethren who was submitting to the rule of the monastery sufficiently
difficult and elevated precepts, which as we said, I summarized as
briefly as I could in the fourth book of the Institutes, the heights of
a true renunciation seemed to us so unattainable and so marvellous that
we did not think that such humble folks as we could ever scale them. And
therefore, cast down in despair, and not concealing in our looks the
inner bitterness of our thoughts, we came back to the blessed old man
with a tolerably anxious heart: and when he at once asked the reason why
we were so sad, Abbot Germanus groaned deeply and replied as follows.
