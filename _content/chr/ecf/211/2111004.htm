<p> <a name="iv.vi.v.iv"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.v.iv-p0.1"></A>Chapter IV.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.v.iv-p1"></A>How Abraham, David, and other saints went beyond the requirement of the law.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.v.iv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.v.iv-p2.1"></A>For</span> so we read that Abraham went beyond the requirement of the law which was afterwards to be given, when after his victory over the four kings, he would not touch any of the spoils of Sodom, which were fairly due to him as the conqueror, and which indeed the king himself, whose spoils he had rescued, offered him; and with an oath by the Divine name he exclaimed: &#8220;I lift up my hand to the Lord Most High, who made heaven and earth, that I will not take from a thread to a shoe&#146;s latchet of all that is thine.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2163"></A><A HREF="#fn_2163"><FONT SIZE="1">2164</FONT></A>
 So we know that David went beyond the requirement of the law, as, though Moses commanded that vengeance should be taken on enemies,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2164"></A><A HREF="#fn_2164"><FONT SIZE="1">2165</FONT></A>
 he not only did not do this, but actually embraced his persecutors with love, and piously entreated the Lord for them, and wept bitterly and avenged them when they were slain. So we are sure that Elijah and Jeremiah were not under the law, as though they might without blame have taken advantage of lawful matrimony, yet they preferred to remain virgins. So we read that Elisha and others of the same mode of life went beyond the commands of Moses, as of them the Apostle speaks as follows: &#8220;They went about in sheepskins and in goatskins, they were oppressed, afflicted, in want, of whom the world was not worthy, they wandered about in deserts and in mountains, and in caves and in dens of the earth.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2165"></A><A HREF="#fn_2165"><FONT SIZE="1">2166</FONT></A>
 What shall I say of the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab, of whom we are told that, when at the Lord&#146;s bidding the prophet Jeremiah offered them wine, they replied: &#8220;We drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying: Ye shall drink no wine, ye and your sons forever: and ye shall build no house, nor sow any seed, nor plant vineyards nor possess them: but ye shall dwell in tents all your days&#8221;? Wherefore also they were permitted to hear from the same prophet these words: &#8220;Thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: there shall not fail a man from the stock of Jonadab the son of Rechab to stand in My sight all the days;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2166"></A><A HREF="#fn_2166"><FONT SIZE="1">2167</FONT></A>
 as all of them were not satisfied with merely offering tithes of their possessions, but actually refused property, and offered the rather to God themselves and their souls, for which no redemption can be made by man, as the Lord testifies in the gospel: &#8220;For what shall a man give in exchange for his own soul?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2167"></A><A HREF="#fn_2167"><FONT SIZE="1">2168</FONT></A>
