<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.iii.i-p3"></A> According to S. Jerome, Hilarion was the first to introduce the monastic life into Palestine (<i>Vita Hilar</i>.). His work was carried on by his companion and pupil Hesycas and Epiphanius, afterwards Bishop of Salamis in Cyprus. In Asia Minor S. Basil was the greater organizer of monasticism, though, as he tells us, there were already many monks, not only in Egypt but also in Palestine, C&#339;losyria, and Mesopotamia (Ep. ccxxiii.<a name="iv.iii.iii.i-p3.1"></A>). See also on the early monks of Palestine and the East, Sozomen, H. E., Book VI., cc. xxxii.&#8211;xxxv.</p>
