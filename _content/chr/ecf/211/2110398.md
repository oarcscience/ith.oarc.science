#### <span id="iv.iii.v.xxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXV.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxv-p1"></span>Of the abstinence of one old man who
took food six times so sparingly that he was still hungry.

<span id="iv.iii.v.xxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.xxv-p2.1"></span>When</span> one of the elders was pressing
me to eat a little more as I was taking refreshment, and I said that I
could not, he replied: “I have already laid my table six times for
different brethren who had arrived, and, pressing each of them, I
partook of food with him, and am still hungry, and do you, who now
partake of refreshment for the first time, say that you cannot eat any
more?”

[Next: Chapter XXVI. Of another old man, who never partook of food alone
in his cell.](2110399)
