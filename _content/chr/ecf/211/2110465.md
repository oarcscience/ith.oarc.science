<span id="iv.iii.viii.xvii-p1"></span>That the peace of our heart does
not depend on another’s will, but lies in our own control.

<span id="iv.iii.viii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span

improvement and peace of mind must not be made to depend on another’s
will, which cannot possibly be subject to our authority, but it lies
rather in our own control. And so the fact that we are not angry ought
not to result from another’s perfection, but from our own virtue, which
is acquired, not by somebody else’s patience, but by our own
long-suffering.
