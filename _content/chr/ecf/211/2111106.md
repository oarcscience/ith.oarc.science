#### <span id="iv.vii.iv.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.ii-p1"></span>The title of God is given in one sense
to Christ, and in another to men.

<span id="iv.vii.iv.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.iv.ii-p2.1"></span>The</span> name of God would for the
faithful be amply sufficient to denote the glory of His Divinity, but by
adding “over all, God blessed,” he excludes a blasphemous and perverse
interpretation of it, for fear that some evil-disposed person to
depreciate His absolute Divinity might quote the fact that the word God
is sometimes applied by grace in the Divine economy temporarily to men,
and thus apply it to God by unworthy comparisons, as where God says to
Moses: “I have given thee as a God to Pharaoh,” <span
id="fr_2419"></span>[2420](#fn_2419) or in this passage: “I said ye are
Gods,” <span id="fr_2420"></span>[2421](#fn_2420) where it clearly has
the force of a title given by condescension. For as it says “I said,” it
is not a name showing power, so much as a title given by the speaker.
But that passage also, where it says: “I have given thee as a God to
Pharaoh,” shows the power of the giver rather than the Divinity of him
who receives the title. For when it says: “I have given,” it thereby
certainly indicates the power of God, who gave, and not the Divine
nature, in the person of the recipient. But when it is said of our God
and Lord Jesus Christ, “who is over all, God blessed for ever,” the fact
is at once proved by the words, and the meaning of the words shown by
the name given: because in the case of the Son of God the name of God
does not denote an adoption by favour, but what is truly and really His
nature.
