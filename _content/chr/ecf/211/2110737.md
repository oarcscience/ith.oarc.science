#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxviii-p1"></span>How we ought not to despise those
who are delivered up to unclean spirits.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xxviii-p2.1"></span>From</span> which it plainly results
that we ought not to hate or despise those whom we see to be delivered
up to various temptations or to those spirits of evil, because we ought
firmly to hold these two points: first, that none of them can be tempted
at all by them without God’s permission, and secondly that all things
which are brought upon us by God, whether they seem to us at the present
time to be sad or joyful, are inflicted for our advantage as by a most
kind father and most compassionate physician, and that therefore men
are, as it were, given into the charge of schoolmasters, and humbled in
order that when they depart out of this world they may be removed in a
state of greater purity to the other life, or have a lighter punishment
inflicted on them, as they have been, as the Apostle says, delivered
over at the present time “to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that
the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.” <span
