#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXI.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxi-p1"></span>The instance of Joash, King of
Judah, showing what was the consequence of his pride.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xxi-p2.1"></span>Some</span> such thing we read of in the
book of Chronicles. For Joash the king of Judah at the age of seven was
summoned by Jehoiada the priest to the kingdom and by the witness of
Scripture is commended for all his actions as long as the aforesaid
priest lived. But hear what Scripture relates of him after Jehoiada’s
death, and how he was puffed up with pride and given over to a most
disgraceful state. “But after the death of Jehoiada the princes went in
and worshipped the king: and he was soothed by their services and
hearkened unto them. And they forsook the temple of the Lord, the God of
their fathers, and served groves and idols, and great wrath came upon
Judah and Jerusalem because of this sin.” And after a little: “When a
year was come about, the army of Syria came up against him: and they
came to Judah and Jerusalem, and killed all the princes of the people,
and they sent all the spoils to the king to Damascus. And whereas there
came a very small number of the Syrians, the Lord delivered into their
hands an infinite multitude, because they had forsaken the Lord the God
of their fathers: and on Joash they executed shameful judgments. And
departing they left him in great diseases.” <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[1073](#fn_1072) You see how the consequence of
pride was that he was given over to shocking and filthy passions. For he
who is puffed up with pride and has permitted himself to be worshipped
as God, is (as the Apostle says) “given over to shameful passions and a
reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient.” <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1074](#fn_1073) And because, as Scripture says,
“every one who exalts his heart is unclean before God,” <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074) he who is puffed up with swelling
pride of heart is given over to most shameful confusion to be deluded by
it, that when thus humbled he may know that he is unclean through
impurity of the flesh and knowledge of impure desires,—a thing which he
had refused to recognize in the pride of his heart; and also that the
shameful infection of the <span id="page_287">p. 287</span> <span
id="iv.iii.xii.xxi-Page_287"></span>flesh may disclose the hidden
impurity of the heart, which he contracted through the sin of pride, and
that through the patent pollution of his body he may be proved to be
impure, who did not formerly see that he had become unclean through the
pride of his spirit.
