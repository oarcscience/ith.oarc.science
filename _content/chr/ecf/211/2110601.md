#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.x-p1"></span>The answer how true discretion may be
gained.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.x-p2.1"></span>Then</span> Moses: True discretion, said
he, is only secured by true humility. And of this <span id="page_312">p.
312</span> <span id="iv.iv.iii.x-Page_312"></span>humility the first
proof is given by reserving everything (not only what you do but also
what you think), for the scrutiny of the elders, so as not to trust at
all in your own judgment but to acquiesce in their decisions in all
points, and to acknowledge what ought to be considered good or bad by
their traditions. <span id="fr_1180"></span>[1181](#fn_1180) And this
habit will not only teach a young man to walk in the right path through
the true way of discretion, but will also keep him unhurt by all the
crafts and deceits of the enemy. For a man cannot possibly be deceived,
who lives not by his own judgment but according to the example of the
elders, nor will our crafty foe be able to abuse the ignorance of one
who is not accustomed from false modesty to conceal all the thoughts
which rise in his heart, but either checks them or suffers them to
remain, in accordance with the ripened judgment of the elders. For a
wrong thought is enfeebled at the moment that it is discovered: and even
before the sentence of discretion has been given, the foul serpent is by
the power of confession dragged out, so to speak, from his dark
under-ground cavern, and in some sense shown up and sent away in
disgrace. For evil thoughts will hold sway in us just so long as they
are hidden in the heart: and that you may gather still more effectually
the power of this judgment I will tell you what Abbot Serapion
did, <span id="fr_1181"></span>[1182](#fn_1181) and what he used often
to tell to the younger brethren for their edification.
