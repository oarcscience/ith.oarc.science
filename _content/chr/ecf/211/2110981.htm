<p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.iii.xi-p2.1"></A>Germanus</span>: By what treatment can any help be given to us or to others who are thus weak and only up to this; who had received but little instruction in the system of the C&#339;nobium when we began to aspire to dwell in solitude before we had got rid of our faults; or by what means shall we be able to acquire the constancy of an imperturbable mind, and immovable steadfastness of patience; we who all too soon gave up the common life in the C&#339;nobium, and forsook the schools and training ground for these exercises, in which our principles ought first to have been thoroughly schooled and perfected? How then can we now while we are living alone gain perfection in long-suffering and patience; or how can conscience, that searcher out of inward motives, discover whether these virtues exist in us or are wanting, so that because we are severed from intercourse with men, and not irritated by any of their provocations, we may not be deceived by false notions, and fancy that we have gained that imperturbable peace of mind?</p>
