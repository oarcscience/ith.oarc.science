#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xv-p1"></span>How Christ could be said by the
Apostle to be without genealogy.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xv-p2.1"></span>How</span> does he say that the Lord was
“without genealogy,” when the Gospel of the Evangelist Matthew begins
with the Saviour’s genealogy, saying: “The book of the generations of
Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham”? <span
id="fr_2625"></span>[2626](#fn_2625) Therefore according to the
Evangelist He has a genealogy, and according to the Apostle, He has not:
for according to the Evangelist, He has it on the mother’s side,
according to the Apostle He has not, as He springs from the Father. And
so the Apostle well says: “Without father, without mother, without
genealogy:” and where he lays down that He was begotten without mother,
there also he records that He was without genealogy. And thus as regards
both the nativities of the Lord, the writings of the Evangelist and of
the Apostle agree together. For according to the Evangelist He has a
genealogy “without father,” when born in the flesh: and according to the
Apostle, the Lord has not, when begotten in His Divine nature “without
mother;” as Isaiah says: “But who shall declare His generation?” <span
