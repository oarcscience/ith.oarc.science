#### <span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="ii.v.ii.ii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.v.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>For</span> it is a great and a divine thing,
almost beyond a corporeal nature, to lay aside <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164) luxury, and to extinguish, by strength
of mind, the flame of concupiscence, kindled by the torch of youth; to
put down by spiritual effort the force of natural delight; to live in
opposition to the practice of the human race; to despise the comforts of
wedlock; to disdain the sweet enjoyments derived from children; and to
regard as nothing, in the hope of future blessedness, everything that is
reckoned among the advantages of this present life. This is, as I have
said, a great and admirable virtue, and is not undeservedly destined to
a vast reward, in proportion to the greatness of its labor. The
Scripture says, “I will give to the eunuchs, saith the Lord, a place in
my house and within my walls, a place counted better than <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165) sons and daughters; I will give them
an eternal name, and it shall not <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166) fail.” The Lord again speaks
concerning such eunuchs in the Gospel, saying, “For there are eunuchs
who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s
sake.” <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167) Great, indeed, is the
struggle connected with chastity, but greater is the reward; the
restraint is temporal, but the reward will be eternal. For the blessed
Apostle John also speaks concerning these, saying that “they follow the
Lamb whithersoever he goeth.” <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168)
This, I think, is to be understood to the following effect, that there
will be no place in the court of heaven closed against them, but that
all the habitations of the divine mansions will be thrown open before
them.
