<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.ii.ix-p1"></A>Of the characteristics of the prayer, the fuller treatment of which is reserved for the Conferences of the Elders.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.ii.ix-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.ii.ix-p2.1"></A>And</span> as the plan of these Institutes leads us to the system of the canonical prayers, the fuller treatment of which we will however reserve for the Conferences of the Elders (where we shall speak of them at greater length when we have begun to tell in their own words of the character of their prayers, and how continuous they are), still I think it well, as far as the place and my narrative permit, as the occasion offers itself, to glance briefly for the present at a few points, so that by picturing in the meanwhile the movements of the outer man, and by now laying the foundations, as it were, of the prayer, we may afterwards, when we come to speak of the inner man, with less labour build up the complete edifice of his prayers; providing, above all, for this, that if the end of life should overtake us and cut us off from finishing the narration which we are anxious (D.V.) fitly to compose, we may at least leave in this work the <i>beginnings</i> of so necessary a matter to you, to whom everything seems a delay, by reason of the fervour of your desire: so that, if a few more years of life are granted to us, we may at least mark out for you some outlines of their prayers, that those above all who live in monasteries may have some information about them; providing also, at the same time, that those who perhaps may meet only with this book, and be unable to procure the other, may find that they are supplied with some sort of information about the nature of their prayers; and as they are instructed about the dress and clothing of the outer man, so too they may not be ignorant what his behaviour ought to be in offering spiritual sacrifices.  <A NAME="page_209"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 209</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.ii.ix-Page_209"></A>Since, though <i>these</i> books, which we are now arranging with the Lord&#146;s help to write, are mainly taken up with what belongs to the outer man and the customs of the C&#339;nobia, yet <i>those</i> will rather be concerned with the training of the inner man and the perfection of the heart, and the life and doctrine of the Anchorites.</p>
