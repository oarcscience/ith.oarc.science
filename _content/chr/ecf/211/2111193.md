#### <span id="iv.vii.viii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xviii-p1"></span>How we are to understand the
Apostle’s words: “He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the
Spirit,” etc.

<span id="iv.vii.viii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.viii.xviii-p2.1"></span>For</span> to begin with this
assertion of yours that the Spirit filled with righteousness (justitia)
what was created, and your attempts to prove this by the evidence of the
Apostle, where he says that “He appeared in the flesh, was justified in
the Spirit,” you make each statement in an unsound sense and wild
spirit. For you make this assertion; viz., that you will have it that He
was filled with righteousness by the Spirit, in order to show how He was
void of righteousness, as you assert that the being filled with it was
given to Him. And as for your use of the evidence of the Apostle on this
matter, you garble the arrangement and meaning of the sacred passage.
For the Apostle’s statement is not as you have quoted it, mutilated and
spoilt. For what says the Apostle? “And evidently great is the mystery
of Godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the
Spirit.” <span id="fr_2637"></span>[2638](#fn_2637) You see then that
the Apostle declared that the mystery or sacrament of Godliness was
justified. For he was not so forgetful of his own words and teaching as
to say that He was void of righteousness, whom he had always proclaimed
as righteousness, saying: “Who was made unto us righteousness and
sanctification and redemption.” <span
id="fr_2638"></span>[2639](#fn_2638) Elsewhere also he says: “But ye
were washed, but ye were justified, but ye were sanctified in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ.” <span id="fr_2639"></span>[2640](#fn_2639)
How far then from Him was it to need being filled with righteousness, as
He Himself filled all things with righteousness, and for His glory to be
without righteousness, whose very name justifies all things. You see
then how foolish and wild are your blasphemies, since you are trying to
take away from our Lord what is ever shed forth by Him upon all
believers in such a way that still in its continuous supply it is never
diminished.
