<p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.vii.iv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.vii.iv-p2.1"></A>You</span> see then that the Creed has the authority of God: for &#8220;a short word will the Lord make upon the earth.&#8221; But perhaps you want the authority of men: nor is that wanting, for God made it by means of men. For as He fashioned the whole body of the sacred Scriptures by means of the patriarchs and more particularly his own prophets, so He formed the Creed by means of His apostles and priests. And whatever He enlarged on in these (in Scripture) with copious and abundant material, He here embraced in a most complete and compendious form by means of His own servants. There is nothing wanting then in the Creed; because as it was formed from the Scriptures of God by the apostles of God, it has in it all the authority it can possibly have, whether of men or of God: Although too that which was made by men, must be accounted God&#146;s work, for we should not look on it so much as their work, by whose instrumentality it was made, but rather as His, who was the actual maker. &#8220;I believe,&#8221; then, says the Creed, &#8220;in one true and only God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son and the first-born of every creature; Begotten of Him before all worlds, and not made; Very God of Very God, being of one substance with the Father; by whom both the worlds were framed and all things were made; who for us came, and was born of the Virgin Mary; and was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and was buried. And the third day He rose again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven: and shall come again to judge the quick and the dead,&#8221; etc.</p>
