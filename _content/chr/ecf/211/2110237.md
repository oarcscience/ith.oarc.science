#### <span id="ii.vi.ii.xlviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XLVIII.

<span id="ii.vi.ii.xlviii-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.ii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>And</span> then Instantius, Salvianus,
and Priscillian set out for Rome, in order that before Damasus who was
at that time the bishop of the city, they might clear themselves of the
charges brought against them. Well, their journey led them through the
heart of Aquitania, and being there received with great pomp by such as
knew no better, they spread the seeds of their heresy. Above all, they
perverted by their evil teachings the people of Elusa, who were then of
a good and religious disposition. They were driven forth from Bordeaux
by Delfinus, yet lingering for a little while in the territory of
Euchrotia, <span id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389) they infected some
with their errors. They then pursued the journey on which they had
entered, attended by a base and shameful company, among whom were their
wives and even strange women. In the number of these was Euchrotia and
her daughter Procula, of the latter of whom there was a common report
that, when pregnant through adultery with Priscillian, she procured
abortion by the use of certain plants. When they reached Rome with the
wish of clearing themselves before Damasus, they were not even admitted
to his presence. Returning to Milan, they found that Ambrose was equally
opposed to them. Then they changed their plans, with the view that, as
they had not got the better of the two bishops, who were at that time
possessed of the highest authority, they might, by bribery and flattery,
obtain what they desired from the emperor. Accordingly, having won over
Macedonius, who was the master <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390)
of public services, they procured a rescript, by which, those decrees
which had formerly been made being trampled under foot, they were
ordered to be restored to their churches. Relying upon this, Instantius
and Priscillian made their wayback to Spain (for Salvianus had died in
the city); and they then, without any struggle, recovered the churches
over which they had ruled.
