#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xxvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVI.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxvi-p1"></span>That a man whose foundation is bad,
sinks daily from bad to worse.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>Those</span> then who are possessed by
such distrust of mind, and who through the devil’s own want of faith
fall away from that spark of faith, by which they seemed in the early
days of their conversion to be enkindled, begin more anxiously to watch
over the money which before they had begun to give away, and treasure it
up with greater avarice, as men who cannot recover again what they have
once wasted: or—what is still worse—take back what they had formerly
cast away: or else (which is a third and most disgusting kind of sin),
collect what they never before possessed, and thus are convicted of
having gone no further in forsaking the world than merely to take the
name and style of monk. With this beginning therefore, and on this bad
and rotten foundation, it is a matter of course that the whole
superstructure of faults must rise, nor can anything be built on such
villainous foundations, except what will bring the wretched soul to the
ground with a hopeless collapse.
