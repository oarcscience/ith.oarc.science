#### <span id="iv.v.viii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.v.viii.vii-p1"></span>The answer on the difference of
customs in the two countries.

<span id="iv.v.viii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.vii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: Although we ought to be
*most* grateful for the teaching of those men who taught us from our
youth up to attempt great things, and, by giving us a taste of their
excellence, implanted in our hearts a splendid thirst for perfection,
yet if any reliance is to <span id="page_462">p. 462</span> <span
id="iv.v.viii.vii-Page_462"></span>be placed on our judgment, we cannot
draw any comparison between these customs and those which we learnt
there, so as to hold our tongues about the inimitable purity of your
life, which we believe is granted to you not only owing to the
concentration of your mind and aim, but also owing to the aid and
assistance of the place itself. Wherefore we do not doubt that for the
following of your grand perfection this instruction which is given to us
is not enough by itself, unless we have also the help of the life, and a
long course of instruction somewhat dissolves the coldness of our heart
by daily training.

promises absolutely, and whether decisions can be reversed without
sin.](2110928)
