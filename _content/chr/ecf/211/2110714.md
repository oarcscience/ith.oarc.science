#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.v-p1"></span>On the perfection of the soul, as
drawn from the comparison of the Centurion in the gospel.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.v-p2.1"></span>Of</span> this perfect mind then there is
an excellent figure drawn in the case of the centurion in the gospel;
whose virtue and consistency, owing to which he was not led away by the
rush of thoughts, but in accordance with his own judgment either
admitted such as were good, or easily drove away those of the opposite
character, are described in this tropical form: “For I also am a man
under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go,
and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do
this, and he doeth it.” <span id="fr_1444"></span>[1445](#fn_1444) If
then we too strive manfully against disturbances and sins and can bring
them under our own control and discretion, and fight and destroy the
passions in our flesh, and bring under the sway of reason <span
id="page_364">p. 364</span> <span id="iv.iv.viii.v-Page_364"></span>the
swarm of our thoughts, and drive back from our breast the terrible hosts
of the powers opposed to us by the life-giving standard of the Lord’s
cross, we shall in reward for such triumphs be promoted to the rank of
that centurion spiritually understood, who, as we read in Exodus, was
mystically pointed to by Moses: “Appoint for thee rulers of thousands,
and of hundreds, and of fifties and of tens.” <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1446](#fn_1445) And so we too when raised to the
height of this dignity shall have the same right and power to command,
so that we shall not be carried away by thoughts against our will, but
shall be able to continue in and cling to those which spiritually
delight us, commanding the evil suggestions to depart, and they will
depart, while to good ones we shall say “Come,” and they will come: and
to our servant also, i.e., the body, we shall in like manner enjoin what
belongs to chastity and continence, and it will serve us without any
gainsaying, no longer arousing in us the hostile incitements of
concupiscence, but showing all subservience to the spirit. And what is
the character of the arms of this centurion, and for what use in battle
they are, hear the blessed Apostle declaring: “The arms,” he says “of
our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God.” He tells us their
character; viz., that they are not carnal or weak, but spiritual and
mighty to God. Then he next suggests in what struggles they are to be
used: “Unto the pulling down of fortifications, purging the thoughts,
and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and
bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of
Christ, and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your
obedience shall be first fulfilled.” <span
id="fr_1446"></span>[1447](#fn_1446) And since though useful, it yet
belongs to another time to run through these one by one, I only want you
to see the different sorts of these arms and their characteristics, as
we also ought always to walk with them girt upon us if we mean to fight
the Lord’s battles and to serve among the centurions of the gospel.
“Take,” he says “the shield of faith, wherewith ye may be able to quench
all the fiery darts of the evil one.” <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[1448](#fn_1447) Faith then is that which intercepts
the flaming darts of lust, and destroys them by the fear of future
judgment, and belief in the heavenly kingdom. “And the breastplate,” he
says, “of charity.” <span id="fr_1448"></span>[1449](#fn_1448) This
indeed is that which going round the vital parts of the breast and
protecting what is exposed to the deadly wounds of swelling thoughts,
keeps off the blows opposed to it, and does not allow the darts of the
devil to penetrate to our inner man. For it “endureth all things,
suffereth all things, beareth all things.” <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[1450](#fn_1449) “And for an helmet the hope of
salvation.” <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1451](#fn_1450) The helmet is
what protects the head. As then Christ is our head, we ought always in
all temptations and persecutions to protect it with the hope of future
good things to come, and especially to keep faith in Him whole and
undefiled. For it is possible for one who has lost other parts of the
body, weak as he may be, still to survive: but even a short time of
living is extended to no one without a head. “And the sword of the
Spirit which is the word of God.” <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1452](#fn_1451) For it is “sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit,
and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
intents of the heart:” <span id="fr_1452"></span>[1453](#fn_1452) as it
divides and cuts off whatever carnal and earthly things it may find in
us. And whosoever is protected by these arms will ever be defended from
the weapons and ravages of his foes, and will not be led away bound in
the chains of his spoilers, a captive and a prisoner, to the hostile
land of vain thoughts, nor hear the words of the prophet: “Why art thou
grown old in a strange country?” <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[1454](#fn_1453) But he will stand like a triumphant
conqueror in the land of thoughts which he has chosen. Would you
understand too the strength and courage of this centurion, by which he
bears these arms of which we spoke before as not carnal but mighty to
God? Hear of the selection by which the King himself marks and approves
brave men when he summons them to the spiritual combat. “Let,” says He,
“the weak say that I am strong;” and: “Let him who is the sufferer
become a warrior.” <span id="fr_1454"></span>[1455](#fn_1454) You see
then that none but sufferers and weak people can fight the Lord’s
battles, weak indeed with that weakness, founded on which that centurion
of ours in the gospel said with confidence: “For when I am weak, then am
I strong,” and again, “for strength is made perfect in weakness.” <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[1456](#fn_1455) Of which weakness one of the
prophets says: “And he that is weak among them shall be as the house of
David.” <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1457](#fn_1456) For the patient
sufferer shall fight these wars, with that patience of which it is said
“patience is necessary for you that doing the will of God you may
receive the reward.” <span id="fr_1457"></span>[1458](#fn_1457)
