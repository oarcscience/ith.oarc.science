<span id="iv.iv.iv.ix"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.iv.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ix-p1"></span>Of three sorts of possessions.

<span id="iv.iv.iv.ix-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iv.ix-p2.1"></span>Riches</span> and possessions are taken in
Holy Scripture in three different ways, i.e., as good, bad, and
indifferent. Those are bad, of which it is said: “The rich have wanted
and have suffered hunger,” <span id="fr_1229"></span>[1230](#fn_1229)
and “Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your
consolation:” <span id="fr_1230"></span>[1231](#fn_1230) and to have
cast off these riches is the height of perfection; and a distinction
which belongs to those poor who are commended in the gospel by the
Lord’s saying: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven;” <span id="fr_1231"></span>[1232](#fn_1231) and in
the Psalm: “This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him,” <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[1233](#fn_1232) and again: “The poor and needy
shall praise thy name.” <span id="fr_1233"></span>[1234](#fn_1233) Those
riches are good, to acquire which is the work of great virtue and merit,
and the righteous possessor of which is praised by David who says “The
generation of the righteous shall be blessed: glory and riches are in
his house, and his righteousness remaineth for ever:” <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1235](#fn_1234) and again “the ransom of a man’s
life are his riches.” <span id="fr_1235"></span>[1236](#fn_1235) And of
these riches it is said in the Apocalypse to him who has them not and to
his shame is poor and naked: “I will begin,” says he, “to vomit thee out
of my mouth. Because thou sayest I am rich and wealthy and have need of
nothing: and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor
and blind and naked, I counsel thee to buy of me gold fire-tried, that
thou mayest be made rich, and mayest be clothed in white garments, and
that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear.” <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1237](#fn_1236) There are some also which are
indifferent, i.e., which may be made either good or bad: for they are
made either one or the other in accordance with the will and character
of those who use them: of which the blessed, Apostle says “Charge the
rich of this world not to be high-minded nor to trust in the uncertainty
of riches, but in God (who giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy), to
do good, to give easily, to communicate to others, to lay up in store
for themselves a good foundation that they may lay hold on the true
life.” <span id="fr_1237"></span>[1238](#fn_1237) These are what the
rich man in the gospel kept, and never distributed to the poor,—while
the beggar Lazarus was lying at his gate and desiring to be fed with his
crumbs; and so he was condemned to the unbearable flames and everlasting
heat of hell-fire. <span id="fr_1238"></span>[1239](#fn_1238)
