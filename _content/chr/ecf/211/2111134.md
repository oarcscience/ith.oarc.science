#### <span id="iv.vii.v.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.vii.v.xiii-p1"></span>He explains who are those in whose
person the Prophet Isaiah says: “Thou art our God, and we knew Thee
not.”

<span id="iv.vii.v.xiii-p2"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.v.xiii-p2.1"></span>Thou</span> art then,” he says, “our God,
and we knew Thee not, O God of Israel the Saviour.” Who do you imagine
chiefly say this; and in whose mouths are such words specially suitable,
Jews or Gentiles? If you say Jews: certainly the Jews did not know
Christ, as it is said, “But Israel hath not known Me, My people have not
considered;” <span id="fr_2486"></span>[2487](#fn_2486) and, “The world
was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and
His own received Him not.” <span id="fr_2487"></span>[2488](#fn_2487)
But if you say Gentiles, it is clear that the Gentile world was given
over to idols, and knew not Christ, though it knew not the Father any
more; but still if it has now come to know Him, it is only through
Christ. You see then that whether the believing people belong to the
Jews or the Gentiles, in either case they can truly say for themselves:
“Thou art our God; and we knew Thee not, O God of Israel the Saviour.”
For the Gentiles who formerly worshipped idols knew not God; and the
Jews who denied the Lord, knew not the Son of God. And thus both truly
say of Christ: “Thou art our God and we knew Thee not.” For those who
did not believe in God were as ignorant of Him as those who denied the
Son of God. If therefore Christ is to be believed in, as the truth
declares, as the Deity asserts, as indeed Christ Himself declares, who
is both, why are you miserably trying in your madness to interpose
between God and Christ? Why do you seek to divide His body from the Son
of God, and try to separate God from Himself?  You are severing what is
one, and dividing what is joined together. Believe the Word of God
concerning God: for you cannot possibly make a better confession of
God’s Divinity than by confessing with your voice that which God teaches
about Himself. For you must know that, as the Prophet says, “the Lord
Himself is God, who found out all the way of knowledge; who was seen
upon earth and conversed with men.” <span
id="fr_2488"></span>[2489](#fn_2488) He brought the light of faith into
the world. He showed the light of salvation. “For God is the Lord, and
hath given us light.” <span id="fr_2489"></span>[2490](#fn_2489) Then
believe Him, and love Him, and confess Him. For since, as it is written,
“Every knee shall bow to Him, of things in heaven, and things on earth,
and things under the earth, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus
Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father,” <span
id="fr_2490"></span>[2491](#fn_2490) whether you will or no, you cannot
deny that Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father. For this
is the crowning virtue of a perfect confession, to acknowledge that
Jesus Christ is ever Lord and God in the glory of God the Father.
