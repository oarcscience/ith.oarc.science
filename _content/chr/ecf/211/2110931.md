#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xi-p1"></span>The answer that we must take into
account the purpose of the doer rather than the execution of the
business.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xi-p2.1"></span>Joseph</span>: In every case, as we said,
we must look not at the progress of the work but at the intention of the
worker, nor must we inquire to begin with what a man has done, but with
what purpose, so that we may find that some have been condemned for
those deeds from which good has afterwards arisen, and on the other hand
that some have arrived by means of acts in themselves reprehensible at
the height of righteousness. And in the case of the former the good
result of their actions was of no avail to them as they took the matter
in and with an evil purpose, and wanted to bring about—not the good
which actually resulted, but something of the opposite character; nor
was the bad beginning injurious to the latter, as he put up with the
necessity of a blameworthy start; not out of disregard for God, or with
the purpose of doing wrong, but with an eye to a needful and holy end.

doers, while bad deeds will not injure good men.](2110932)
