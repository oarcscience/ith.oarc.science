<p> <a name="iv.iv.x.v"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.x.v-p0.1"></A>Chapter V.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.x.v-p1"></A>Of the ways in which our soul is weighed down.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.x.v-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.x.v-p2.1"></A>But</span> we should notice the ways in which the Lord points out that the soul is weighed down: for He did not mention adultery, or fornication, or murder, or blasphemy, or rapine, which everybody knows to be deadly and  <A NAME="page_389"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 389</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.x.v-Page_389"></A>damnable, but surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares or anxieties of this world: which men of this world are so far from avoiding or considering damnable that actually some who (I am ashamed to say) call themselves monks entangle themselves in these very occupations as if they were harmless or useful. And though these three things, when literally given way to weigh down the soul, and separate it from God, and bear it down to things earthly, yet it is very easy to avoid them, especially for us who are separated by so great a distance from all converse with this world, and who do not on any occasion have anything to do with those visible cares and drunkenness and surfeiting. But there is another surfeiting which is no less dangerous, and a spiritual drunkenness which it is harder to avoid, and a care and anxiety of this world, which often ensnares us even after the perfect renunciation of all our goods, and abstinence from wine and all feastings and even when we are living in solitude&#8212;and of such the prophet says: &#8220;Awake, ye that are drunk but not with wine;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1587"></A><A HREF="#fn_1587"><FONT SIZE="1">1588</FONT></A>
 and another: &#8220;Be astonished and wonder and stagger: be drunk and not with wine: be moved, but not with drunkenness.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1588"></A><A HREF="#fn_1588"><FONT SIZE="1">1589</FONT></A>
 And of this drunkenness the wine must consequently be what the prophet calls &#8220;the fury of dragons&#8221;: and from what root the wine comes you may hear: &#8220;From the vineyard of Sodom,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is their vine, and their branches from Gomorrha.&#8221; Would you also know about the fruit of that vine and the seed of that branch? &#8220;Their grape is a grape of gall, theirs is a cluster of bitterness&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1589"></A><A HREF="#fn_1589"><FONT SIZE="1">1590</FONT></A>
 for unless we are altogether cleansed from all faults and abstaining from the surfeit of all passions, our heart will without drunkenness from wine and excess of any feasting be weighed down by a drunkenness and surfeiting that is still more dangerous. For that worldly cares can sometimes fall on us who mix with no actions of this world, is clearly shown according to the rule of the Elders, who have laid down that anything which goes beyond the necessities of daily food, and the unavoidable needs of the flesh, belongs to worldly cares and anxieties, as for example if, when a job bringing in a penny would satisfy the needs of our body, we try to extend it by a longer toil and work in order to get twopence or threepence; and when a covering of two tunics would be enough for our use both by night and day, we manage to become the owners of three or four, or when a hut containing one or two cells would be sufficient, in the pride of worldly ambition and greatness we build four or five cells, and these splendidly decorated, and larger than our needs required, thus showing the passion of worldly lusts whenever we can.</p>
