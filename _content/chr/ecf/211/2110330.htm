 whose monastery in the Thebaid is better filled as regards numbers, as it is stricter in the rigour of its system, than all others, for there are in it more than five thousand brethren under the rule of one Abbot; and the obedience with which the whole number of monks is at all times subject to one Elder is what no one among us would render to another even for a short time, or would demand from him.</p>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.iv.i-p3"></A> Tabenna, or Tabenn&aelig;, was an island in the Nile, where was founded a flourishing monastery by Pachomius c. 330 <span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.iv.i-p3.1"></A>a.d</span>. Of Pachomius there is a notice in Sozomen H. E. Book III. c. xiv., and his Rule was translated into Latin, with a preface by S. Jerome who mentions his fame in <i>Ep</i>. cxxvii. There is a Life of Pachomius given by Rosweyde (<i>Vit&aelig; Patrum</i>), which is said to be a translation of a work by a contemporary of his.</p>
