#### <span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p1"></span>On excessive fasts and vigils.

<span id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.iii.xvii-p2.1"></span>For</span> I remember that I had so
often resisted the desire for food, that having abstained from taking
any for two or three days, my mind was not troubled even by the
recollection of any eatables and also that sleep was by the assaults of
the devil so far removed from my eyes, that for several days and nights
I used to pray the Lord to grant a little sleep to my eyes; and then I
felt that I was in greater peril from the want of food and sleep than
from struggling against sloth and gluttony. And so as we ought to be
careful not to fall into dangerous effeminacy through desire for bodily
gratification, nor indulge ourselves with eating before the right time
nor take too much, so also we ought to refresh ourselves with food and
sleep at the proper time even if we dislike it. For the struggle in each
case is caused by the devices of the enemy; and excessive abstinence is
still more injurious to us than careless satiety: for from this latter
the intervention of a healthy compunction will raise us to the right
measure of strictness, and not from the former.
