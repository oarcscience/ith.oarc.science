#### <span id="iv.iii.x.viii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VIII.

<span id="iv.iii.x.viii-p1"></span>That he is sure to be restless who
will not be content with the work of his own hands.

<span id="iv.iii.x.viii-p2"></span>“<span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.viii-p2.1"></span>Because</span> we were not restless among
you.” When he wants to prove by the practice of work that he was not
restless among them, he fully shows that those who will not work are
always restless, owing to the fault of idleness. “Nor did we eat any
man’s bread for nought.” By each expression the teacher of the Gentiles
<span id="page_270">p. 270</span> <span
id="iv.iii.x.viii-Page_270"></span>advances a step in the rebuke. <span
id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970) The preacher of the gospel says that
he has not eaten any man’s bread for nought, as he knows that the Lord
commanded that “they who preach the gospel should live of the
gospel:” <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971) again, “The labourer is
worthy of his meat.” <span id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972) And so if
he who preached the gospel, performing a work so lofty and spiritual,
did not venture in reliance on the Lord’s command to eat his bread for
nought, what shall we do to whom not merely is there no preaching of the
word intrusted, but no cure of souls except our own committed? with what
confidence shall we dare with idle hands to eat our bread for nought,
when the “chosen vessel,” constrained by his anxiety for the gospel and
his work of preaching, did not venture to eat without labouring with his
own hands? “But in labour,” he says “and weariness, working night and
day lest we should be burdensome to any of you.” <span
id="fr_973"></span>[974](#fn_973) Up to this point he amplifies and adds
to his rebuke. For he did not simply say, “We did not eat bread for
nought from any of you,” and then stop short. For it might have been
thought that he was supported by his own private means, and by money
which he had saved, or by other people’s, though not by their
collections and gifts. “But in labour,” he says, “and weariness, working
night and day;” that is, being specially supported by our own labour.
And this, he says, we did not of our own wish, and for our own pleasure,
as rest and bodily exercise suggested, but as our necessities and the
want of food compelled us to do, and that not without great bodily
weariness. For not only throughout the whole day, but also by night,
which seems to be granted for bodily rest, I was continually plying the
work of my hands, through anxiety for food.
