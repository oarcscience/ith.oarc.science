#### <span id="iv.v.viii.xviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVIII.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xviii-p1"></span>An objection that only those men
employed lies with impunity, who lived under the law.

<span id="iv.v.viii.xviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.xviii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: It is no wonder that
these schemes were properly employed in the Old Testament, and that some
holy men laudably or at any rate venially told lies, as we see that many
worse things were permitted to them owing to the rude character of the
times. For why should we wonder that when the blessed David was fleeing
from Saul, in answer to the inquiry of Abimelech the priest who said:
“Why art thou alone, and is no man with thee?” he replied as follows:
“The king hath commanded me a business, and said, Let no man know the
thing for which thou art sent by me, for I have appointed my servants to
such and such a place;” and again: “Hast thou here at hand a spear or a
sword, for I brought not my own sword nor my own weapon with me, for the
king’s business required haste;” or this, when he was brought to Achish
king of Gath, and feigned himself mad and frantic, “and changed his
countenance before them, and slipped down between their hands; and
stumbled against the doors of the gate and his spittle ran down on his
beard;” <span id="fr_2022"></span>[2023](#fn_2022) when they were even
allowed to enjoy crowds of wives and concubines, and no sin was on this
account imputed to them, and when moreover they often shed the blood of
their enemies with their own hand, and this was thought not only worthy
of no blame, but actually praiseworthy? And all these things <span
id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span
id="iv.v.viii.xviii-Page_466"></span>we see by the light of the gospel
are utterly forbidden, so that not one of them can be done without great
sin and guilt. And in the same way we hold that no lie can be employed
by any one, I will not say rightly, but not even venially, however it
may be covered with the colour of piety, as the Lord says: “Let your
speech be yea, yea, nay, nay: but whatsoever is more than these is of
the evil one;” and the Apostle also agrees with this: “And lie not one
to another.” <span id="fr_2023"></span>[2024](#fn_2023)

granted under the old Covenant, has rightly been taken by
many.](2110939)
