#### <span id="iv.v.vii.xi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XI.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xi-p1"></span>How it is impossible for one who trusts
to his own judgment to escape being deceived by the devil’s illusions.

<span id="iv.v.vii.xi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.vii.xi-p2.1"></span>For</span> often it has been proved that
what the Apostle says really takes place. “For Satan himself transforms
himself into an angel of light,” <span
id="fr_1976"></span>[1977](#fn_1976) so that he deceitfully sheds abroad
a confusing and foul obscuration of the thoughts instead of the true
light of knowledge. And unless these thoughts are received in a humble
and gentle heart, and kept for the consideration of some more
experienced brother or approved Elder, and when thoroughly sifted by
their judgment, either rejected or admitted by us, we shall be sure to
venerate in our thoughts an angel of darkness instead of an angel of
light, and be smitten with a grievous destruction: an injury which it is
impossible for any one to avoid who trusts in his own judgment, unless
he becomes a lover and follower of true humility and with all contrition
of heart fulfils what the Apostle chiefly prays for: “If then there be
any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any bowels of
compassion, fulfil ye my joy, that you be of one mind, having the same
love, being of one accord, doing nothing by contention, neither by
vainglory; but in humility each esteeming others better than
themselves;” and this: “in honour preferring one another,” <span
id="fr_1977"></span>[1978](#fn_1977) that each may think more of the
knowledge and holiness of his partner, and hold that the better part of
true discretion is to be found in the judgment of another rather than in
his own.
