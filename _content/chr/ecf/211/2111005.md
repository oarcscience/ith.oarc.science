#### <span id="iv.vi.v.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.vi.v.v-p1"></span>How those who live under the grace of the
Gospel ought to go beyond the requirement of the law.

<span id="iv.vi.v.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.v-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> we ought to know that we
from whom the requirements of the law are no longer exacted, but in
whose ears the word of the gospel daily sounds: “If thou wilt be
perfect, go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven, and come follow Me,” <span
id="fr_2168"></span>[2169](#fn_2168) when we offer to God tithes of our
substance, are still in a way ground down beneath the burden of the law,
and not able to rise to those heights of the gospel, those who conform
to which are recompensed not only by blessings in this present life, but
also by future rewards. For the law promises to those who obey it no
rewards of the kingdom of heaven, but only solaces in this life, saying:
“The man that doeth these things shall live in them.” <span
id="fr_2169"></span>[2170](#fn_2169) But the Lord says to His disciples:
“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven;”
and: “Everyone that leaveth house or brothers or sisters or father or
mother or wife or children or field for My name’s sake, shall receive an
hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.” <span
id="fr_2170"></span>[2171](#fn_2170) And this with good reason. For it
is not so praiseworthy for us to abstain from forbidden as from lawful
things, and not to use these last out of reverence for Him, Who has
permitted us to use them because of our weakness. And so if even those
who, faithfully offering tithes of their fruits, are obedient to the
more ancient precepts of the Lord, cannot yet climb the heights of the
gospel, you can see very clearly how far short of it those fall who do
not even do this. For how can those men be partakers of the grace of the
gospel who disregard the <span id="page_505">p. 505</span> <span
id="iv.vi.v.v-Page_505"></span>fulfilment even of the lighter commands
of the law, to the easy character of which the weighty words of the
giver of the law bear testimony, as a curse is actually invoked on those
who do not fulfil them; for it says: “Cursed is everyone that does not
continue in all things that are written in the book of the law to do
them.” <span id="fr_2171"></span>[2172](#fn_2171) But here on account of
the superiority and excellence of the commandments it is said: “He that
can receive it, let him receive it.” <span
id="fr_2172"></span>[2173](#fn_2172) There the forcible compulsion of
the lawgiver shows the easy character of the precepts; for he says: “I
call heaven and earth to record against you this day, that if ye do not
keep the commandments of the Lord your God ye shall perish from off the
face of the earth.” <span id="fr_2173"></span>[2174](#fn_2173) Here the
grandeur of sublime commands is shown by the very fact that He does not
*order*, but *exhorts*, saying: “if thou wilt be perfect go” and do this
or that. There Moses lays a burden that cannot be refused on those who
are unwilling: here Paul meets with counsels those who are willing and
eager for perfection. For that was not to be enjoined as a general
charge, nor to be required, if I may so say, as a regular rule from all,
which could not be secured by all, owing to its wonderful and lofty
nature; but by counsels all are rather stimulated to grace, that those
who are great may deservedly be crowned by the perfection of their
virtues, while those who are small, and not able to come up to “the
measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,” <span
id="fr_2174"></span>[2175](#fn_2174) although they seem to be lost to
sight and hidden as it were by the brightness of larger stars, may yet
be free from the darkness of the curses which are in the law, and not
adjudged to suffer present evils or visited with eternal punishment.
Christ therefore does not constrain anyone, by the compulsion of a
command, to those lofty heights of goodness, but stimulates them by the
power of free will, and urges them on by wise counsels and the desire of
perfection. For where there is a command, there is duty, and
consequently punishment. But those who keep those things to which they
are driven by the severity of the law established escape the punishment
with which they were threatened, instead of obtaining rewards and a
recompense.
