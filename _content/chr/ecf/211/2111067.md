#### <span id="iv.vi.viii.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.vii-p1"></span>A question why the neighbourhood of
our kinsfolk is considered to interfere with us, whereas it does not
interfere in the case of those living in Egypt.

<span id="iv.vi.viii.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.viii.vii-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: It is a very useful and
needful rule that is given for the kind of works that can be done within
the cells. For we have often proved the value of this not only by the
example of your holiness, based on the imitation of the virtues of the
apostles, but also by our own experience. But it is not sufficiently
clear why we ought so thoroughly to avoid the neighbourhood of our
kinsfolk, which you did not reject altogether. For if we see you,
blamelessly walking in all the way of perfection, and not only dwelling
in your own country but some of you having not even retired far from
their own village, why should that which does not hurt you be considered
bad for us?
