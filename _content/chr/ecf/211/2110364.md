#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXV.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxv-p1"></span>How the fear of the Lord is our
cross.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxxv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxv-p2.1"></span>The</span> fear of the Lord is our
cross. As then one who is crucified no longer has the power of moving or
turning his limbs in any direc<span id="page_231">p. 231</span> <span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxxv-Page_231"></span>tion as he pleases, so we also ought
to affix our wishes and desires—not in accordance with what is pleasant
and delightful to us now, but in accordance with the law of the Lord,
where it constrains us. And as he who is fastened to the wood of the
cross no longer considers things present, nor thinks about his likings,
nor is perplexed by anxiety and care for the morrow, nor disturbed by
any desire of possession, nor inflamed by any pride or strife or
rivalry, grieves not at present injuries, remembers not past ones, and
while he is still breathing in the body considers that he is dead to all
earthly things, <span id="fr_799"></span>[800](#fn_799) sending the
thoughts of his heart on before to that place whither he doubts not that
he is shortly to come: so we also, when crucified by the fear of the
Lord ought to be dead indeed to all these things, i.e. not only to
carnal vices but also to all earthly things, <span
id="fr_800"></span>[801](#fn_800) having the eye of our minds fixed
there whither we hope at each moment that we are soon to pass. For in
this way we can have all our desires and carnal affections mortified.
