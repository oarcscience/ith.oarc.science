#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.xxviii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxviii-p1"></span>How it was revealed to the Abbot
concerning Patermucius that he had done the deed of Abraham; and how
when the same Abbot died, Patermucius succeeded to the charge of the
monastery.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.xxviii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.xxviii-p2.1"></span>And</span> this man’s faith and
devotion was so acceptable to God that it was immediately approved by a
divine testimony. For it was forthwith revealed to the Superior that by
this obedience of his he had copied the deed of the patriarch Abraham.
And when shortly afterwards the same Abbot of the monastery departed out
of this life to Christ, he preferred him to all the brethren, and left
him as his successor and as Abbot to the monastery.
