<span id="iv.iv.vi.ix"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iv.vi.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ix-p1"></span>How dejection and accidie generally
arise without any external provocation, as in the case of other
faults. <span id="fr_1327"></span>[1328](#fn_1327)

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ix-p3"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vi.ix-p3.1"></span>Dejection</span> and accidie generally
arise without any external provocation, like those others of which we
have been speaking: for we are well aware that they often harass
solitaries, and those who have settled themselves in the desert without
any intercourse with <span id="page_343">p. 343</span> <span
id="iv.iv.vi.ix-Page_343"></span>other men, and this in the most
distressing way. And the truth of this any one who has lived in the
desert and made trial of the conflicts of the inner man, can easily
prove by experience.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1327"></span>[342:1328](2110672.htm#fr_1327) <span
id="iv.iv.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.vi.ix-p2"></span> Such is the heading which Gazet gives.
Petschenig edits “De ira atque tristitia, quod inter accedentia vitia
plerumque \[non\] inveniantur;” where “non” is his own insertion, and as
he frankly tells us, the heading does not suit the chapter.

differ from them are akin to one another.](2110673)
