#### <span id="iv.iv.ix.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.i-p1"></span>Of the hospitality of Abbot Serenus.

<span id="iv.iv.ix.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.ix.i-p2.1"></span>When</span> we had finished the duties of
the day, and the congregation had been dismissed from Church we returned
to the old man’s cell, and enjoyed a most sumptuous repast. For instead
of the sauce which with a few drops of oil spread over it was usually
set on the table for his daily meal, he mixed a little decoction and
poured over it a somewhat more liberal allowance of oil than usual; for
each of them when he is going to partake of his daily repast, pours
those drops of oil on, not that he may receive any enjoyment from the
taste of it (for so limited is the supply that it is hardly enough I
will not say to line the passage of his throat and jaws, but even to
pass down it) but that using it, he may keep down the pride of his heart
(which is certain to creep in stealthily and surely if his abstinence is
any stricter) and the incitements to vainglory, for as his abstinence is
practised with the greater secrecy, and is carried on without anyone to
see it, so much the more subtly does it never cease to tempt the man who
conceals it. Then he set before us table salt, and three olives each:
after which he produced a basket containing parched vetches which they
call trogalia, <span id="fr_1515"></span>[1516](#fn_1515) from which we
each took five grains, two prunes and a fig apiece. For it is considered
wrong for anyone to exceed that amount in that desert. And when we had
finished this repast and had begun to ask him again for his promised
solution of the question, “Let us hear,” said the old man, “your
question, the consideration of which we postponed till the present
time.”
