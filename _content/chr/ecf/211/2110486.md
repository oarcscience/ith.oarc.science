#### <span id="iv.iii.x.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iii.x.i-p1"></span>How our sixth combat is against the
spirit of accidie, and what its character is.

<span id="iv.iii.x.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.i-p2.1"></span>Our</span> sixth combat is with what the
Greeks call <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.x.i-p2.2"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.x.i-p2.3"></span>κηδία</span>, which we may term weariness or
distress of heart. This is akin to dejection, and is especially trying
to solitaries, and a dangerous and frequent foe to dwellers in the
desert; and especially disturbing to a monk about the sixth hour, like
some fever which seizes him at stated times, bringing the burning heat
of its attacks on the sick man at usual and regular hours. Lastly, there
are some of the elders who declare that this is the “midday demon”
spoken of in the ninetieth Psalm. <span

“the destruction that wasteth at noonday.”
