#### <span id="iv.vii.vi.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.iii-p1"></span>How this participation in Divinity
which the Pelagians and Nestorians attribute to Christ, is common to all
holy men.

<span id="iv.vii.vi.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.iii-p2.1"></span>You</span> say then that Christ should be
termed a form which received God (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.iii-p2.2"></span>Θεοδόχος</span>), i.e., that He should be
revered not for His own sake because He is God, but because He received
God within Him. And so in this way you make out that there is no
difference between Him and all other holy men: for all holy men have
certainly had God within them. For we know well that God was in the
patriarchs, and that He spoke in the prophets. In a word we believe
that, I do not say apostles and martyrs, but, all the saints and
servants of God have within them the Spirit of God, according to this:
“Ye are the temple of the living God: as God said, For I will dwell in
them.” <span id="fr_2494"></span>[2495](#fn_2494) And again: “Know ye
not that ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in
you?” <span id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495) And thus we are all
receivers of God (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.vii.vi.iii-p4.2"></span>Θεοδόχοι</span>); and in this way you say
that all the saints are only like Christ, and equal to God. But away
with such a wicked and abominable heresy as that the Creator should be
compared to His creatures, the Lord to His servants, the God of things
earthly and heavenly, to earthly frailty: and out of His very kindnesses
this wrong be done to Him; viz., that He who honours man by dwelling in
him should therefore be said to be only the same as man.
