#### <span id="iv.iv.x.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iv.x.i-p1"></span>Introduction to the Conference.

<span id="iv.iv.x.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.x.i-p2.1"></span>What</span> was promised in the second book
of the Institutes <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1582](#fn_1581) on
continual and unceasing perseverance in prayer, shall be by the Lord’s
help fulfilled by the Conferences of this Elder, whom we will now bring
forward; viz., Abbot Isaac: <span id="fr_1582"></span>[1583](#fn_1582)
and when these have been propounded I think that I shall have satisfied
the commands of Pope Castor of blessed memory, and your wishes, O
blessed Pope Leontius and holy brother Helladius, and the length of the
book in its earlier part may be excused, though, in spite of our
endeavour not only to compress what had to be told into a brief
discourse, but also to pass over very many points in silence, it has
been extended to a greater length than we intended. For having commenced
with a full discourse on various regulations which we have thought it
well to curtail for the sake of brevity, at the close the blessed Isaac
spoke these words.

<span id="iv.iv.x.i-p4"></span> Isaac was, as we gathered from c. xxxi.,
a disciple of St. Antony, and is mentioned by Palladius Dial. de vita
Chrysost. There are also a few stories of him in the Apophegmata Patrum
(Migne, Vol. lxv. p. 223); and see the Dictionary of Christian
Biography, Vol. iii. p. 294.
