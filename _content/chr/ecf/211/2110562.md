#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXI.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p1"></span>How we can overcome pride and
attain perfection.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> if we wish the summit
of our building to be perfect and to rise well-pleasing to God, we
should endeavour to lay its foundations not in accordance with the
desires of our own lust, but according to the rules of evangelical
strictness: which can only be the fear of God and humility, proceeding
from kindness and simplicity of heart. But humility cannot possibly be
acquired without giving up everything: and as long as a man is a
stranger to this, he cannot possibly attain the virtue of obedience, or
the strength of patience, or the serenity of kindness, or the perfection
of love; without which things our hearts cannot possibly be a habitation
for the Holy Spirit: as the Lord says through the prophet: “Upon whom
shall My spirit rest, but on him that is humble and quiet and hears My
words,” or according to those copies which express the Hebrew
accurately: “To whom shall I have respect, but to him that is poor and
little and of a contrite spirit and that trembleth at My words?” <span

id="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p3.1"></span>. It is noteworthy that Cassian after
giving a rendering which differs but slightly from that of the old
Latin, as given in Sabbatier’s great work, adds the version of “those
copies which express the Hebrew accurately,” and thus shows his
acquaintance with Jerome’s new translation which he quotes. He does the
same thing again in the Conferences, XXIII. viii.; and On the
Incarnation Against Nestorius IV. iii.; V. ii., xv. Compare also
Institutes VIII. xxi., and Conf. VIII. x.; where he also betrays a
knowledge of the Vulgate. As a general rule, however, his translations
are taken from the old Latin, or possibly in some cases are made by him
from the LXX.
