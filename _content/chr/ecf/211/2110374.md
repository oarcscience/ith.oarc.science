<span id="iv.iii.v.i"></span>

#### <span id="iv.iii.v.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iii.v.i-p1"></span>The transition from the Institutes of
the monks to the struggle against the eight principal faults.

<span id="iv.iii.v.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.v.i-p2.1"></span>This</span> fifth book of ours is now by the
help of God to be produced. For after the four books which have been
composed on the customs of the monasteries, we now propose, being
strengthened by God through your prayers, to approach the struggle
against the eight principal faults, i.e. first, Gluttony or the
pleasures of the palate; secondly, Fornication; thirdly, Covetousness,
which means Avarice, or, as it may more properly be called, the love of
money, fourthly, Anger; fifthly, Dejection; sixthly, “Accidie,” <span
id="fr_818"></span>[819](#fn_818) which is heaviness or <span
id="page_234">p. 234</span> <span
id="iv.iii.v.i-Page_234"></span>weariness of heart; seventhly, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.iii.v.i-p3.10"></span>κενοδοξία</span> which
means foolish or vain glory; eighthly, pride. And on entering upon this
difficult task we need your prayers, O most blessed Pope Castor, more
than ever; that we may be enabled in the first place worthily to
investigate the nature of these in all points however trifling or hidden
or obscure: and next to explain with sufficient clearness the causes of
them and thirdly to bring forward fitly the cures and remedies for them.

<span id="iv.iii.v.i-p3"></span> *Acedia*. It is much to be regretted
that the old English word “Accidie” has entirely dropped out of use. It
is used by Chaucer and other early writers for the sin of spiritual
sloth or sluggishness. See “The Persone’s Tale,” where it is thus
described: “After the sinne of wrath, now wol I speke of the sinne of
accidie or slouth: for envie blindeth the herte of a man, and ire
troubleth a man, and accidie maketh him hevy, thoughtful, and wrawe.
Envie and ire maken bitternesse in herte, which bitternesse is mother of
accidie, and benimeth him the love of alle goodnesse; than is accidie
the anguish of a troubled herte.” The English word lingered on till the
seventeenth century, as it is used by Bishop Hall (Serm.V. 140), in the
form “Acedy,” which is etymologically more correct as being nearer the
Latin *Acedia* and the Greek <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.v.i-p3.1"></span> </span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.v.i-p3.2"></span>᾽</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.v.i-p3.3"></span>Ακηδία</span>, a word which occurs in the
LXX. version of the Old Testament in [Isa.
61:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#003), [Ps.
119:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#028)<span
id="iv.iii.v.i-p3.4"></span>; [Bar.
3:1](../../../bib/apo/bar003.htm#001), [Sir.
29:6](../../../bib/apo/sir029.htm#006)<span id="iv.iii.v.i-p3.5"></span>
(cf. the use of the verb <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.v.i-p3.6"></span>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.iii.v.i-p3.7"></span>κηδιάζω</span> in [Ps.
61:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa061.htm#002), [Ps.
102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001), [Ps.
143:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#004)<span
id="iv.iii.v.i-p3.8"></span>; [Ecclus. xxii.
14](../../../bib/apo/sir022.htm#014)<span id="iv.iii.v.i-p3.9"></span>).
In ecclesiastical writers the term Acedia is a favourite one to denote
primarily the mental prostration induced by fasting and other physical
causes, and afterwards spiritual sloth and sluggishness in general. It
forms the subject of the tenth book of the Institutes, and is treated of
again by Cassian in the Conferences V. iii. sq., cf. also the “Summa” of
S. Thomas, II. ii. q. xxxv., where there is a full discussion of its
nature and character.—cf. Dr. Paget’s essay “Concerning Accidie” in “The
Spirit of Discipline.”

everybody, are ignored by everybody; and how we need the Lord's help to
