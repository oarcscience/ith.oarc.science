<p> <a name="iv.iv.v.ix"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.v.ix-p0.1"></A>Chapter IX.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.v.ix-p1"></A>The answer on the understanding of one who asks rightly.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.v.ix-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.v.ix-p2.1"></A>Daniel</span>: It belongs to the understanding to discern the distinctions and the drift of questions; and it is a main part of knowledge to understand how ignorant you are. Wherefore it is said that &#8220;if a fool asks questions, it will be accounted wisdom,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1293"></A><A HREF="#fn_1293"><FONT SIZE="1">1294</FONT></A>
 because, although one who asks questions is ignorant of the answer to the question raised, yet as he wisely asks, and learns what he does not know, this very fact will be counted as wisdom in him, because he wisely discovers what he was ignorant of. According then to this division of yours, it seems that in this passage the Apostle mentions three things, the lust of the flesh against the spirit, and of the spirit against the flesh, the mutual struggle of which against each other appears to have this as its cause and reason; viz., &#8220;that,&#8221; says he, &#8220;we should not do what we would.&#8221; There remains then a fourth case, which you have overlooked; viz., that we should do what we would not. Now then, we must first discover the meaning of those two desires, i.e., of the flesh and spirit, and so next learn to discuss our free will, which is placed between the two, and then lastly in the same way we can see what cannot belong to our free will.</p>
