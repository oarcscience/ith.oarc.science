<p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.vii.xi-p1"></A>How it is impossible for one who trusts to his own judgment to escape being deceived by the devil&#146;s illusions.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.vii.xi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.vii.xi-p2.1"></A>For</span> often it has been proved that what the Apostle says really takes place. &#8220;For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1976"></A><A HREF="#fn_1976"><FONT SIZE="1">1977</FONT></A>
 so that he deceitfully sheds abroad a confusing and foul obscuration of the thoughts instead of the true light of knowledge. And unless these thoughts are received in a humble and gentle heart, and kept for the consideration of some more experienced brother or approved Elder, and when thoroughly sifted by their judgment, either rejected or admitted by us, we shall be sure to venerate in our thoughts an angel of darkness instead of an angel of light, and be smitten with a grievous destruction: an injury which it is impossible for any one to avoid who trusts in his own judgment, unless he becomes a lover and follower of true humility and with all contrition of heart fulfils what the Apostle chiefly prays for: &#8220;If then there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any bowels of compassion, fulfil ye my joy, that you be of one mind, having the same love, being of one accord, doing nothing by contention, neither by vainglory; but in humility each esteeming others better than themselves;&#8221; and this: &#8220;in honour preferring one another,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1977"></A><A HREF="#fn_1977"><FONT SIZE="1">1978</FONT></A>
 that each may think more of the knowledge and holiness of his partner, and hold that the better part of true discretion is to be found in the judgment of another rather than in his own.</p>
