#### <span id="iv.v.viii.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.v.viii.x-p1"></span>Our question about our fear of the oath
which we gave in the monastery in Syria.

<span id="iv.v.viii.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.viii.x-p2.1"></span>Germanus</span>: In so far as it concerns
our desire, which we undertook to carry out for the sake of spiritual
profit, we were hoping to be edified by continual intercourse with you.
For if we were to return to our monastery it is certain that we should
not only fail of so sublime a purpose, but that we should also <span
id="page_463">p. 463</span> <span
id="iv.v.viii.x-Page_463"></span>suffer grievous loss from the
mediocrity of the manner of life there. But that command of the gospel
frightens us terribly: “Let your speech be yea, yea, nay, nay: but
whatsoever is more than these, is from the evil one.” <span
id="fr_2016"></span>[2017](#fn_2016) For we hold that we cannot
compensate for transgressing so important a command by any
righteousness, nor can that finally turn out well which has once been
started with a bad beginning.
