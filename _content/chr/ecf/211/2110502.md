#### <span id="iv.iii.x.xvii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVII.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xvii-p1"></span>Different passages in which the
Apostle declares that we ought to work, or in which it is shown that he
himself worked.

<span id="iv.iii.x.xvii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.x.xvii-p2.1"></span>In</span> the Epistle to the Ephesians
also he thus gives a charge on this subject of work, saying: “He that
stole, let him now steal no more, but rather let him labour, working
with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to
give to him that suffereth need.” <span
id="fr_979"></span>[980](#fn_979) And in the Acts of the Apostles too we
find that he not only taught this, but actually practised it himself.
For when he had come to Corinth, he did not permit himself to lodge
anywhere except with Aquila and Priscilla, because they were of the same
trade which he himself was accustomed to practise. For we thus read:
“After this, Paul departing from Athens came to Corinth; and finding a
certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, and Priscilla his wife, he
came to them because they were of the same trade; and abode with them,
and worked: for they were tent-makers by trade.” <span
