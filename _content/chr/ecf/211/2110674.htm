<p> <a name="iv.iv.vi.xi"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xi-p0.1"></A>Chapter XI.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xi-p1"></A>Of the origin and character of each of these faults.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xi-p2.1"></A>And</span> now, to speak about each kind of fault separately: of gluttony there are three sorts: (1) that which drives a monk to eat before the proper and stated times; (2) that which cares about filling the belly and gorging it with all kinds of food, and (3) that which is on the lookout for dainties and delicacies. And these three sorts give a monk no little trouble, unless he tries to free himself from all of them with the same care and scrupulousness. For just as one should never venture to break one&#146;s fast before the right time so we must utterly avoid all greediness in eating, and the choice and dainty preparation of our food: for from these three causes different but extremely dangerous conditions of the soul arise. For from the first there springs up dislike of the monastery, and thence there grows up disgust and intolerance of the life there, and this is sure to be soon followed by withdrawal and speedy departure from it. By the second there are kindled the fiery darts of luxury and lasciviousness. The third also weaves the entangling meshes of covetousness for the nets of its prisoners, and ever hinders monks from following the perfect self-abnegation of Christ. And when there are traces of this passion in us we can recognize them by this; viz., if we are kept to dine by one of the brethren we are not content to eat our food with the relish which he has prepared and offers to us, but take the unpar<A NAME="page_344"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 344</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iv.vi.xi-Page_344"></A>donable liberty of asking to have something else poured over it or added to it, a thing which we should never do for three reasons: (1) because the monastic mind ought always to be accustomed to practise endurance and abstinence, and like the Apostle, to learn to be content in whatever state he is.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1328"></A><A HREF="#fn_1328"><FONT SIZE="1">1329</FONT></A>
 For one who is upset by taking an unsavoury morsel once and in a way, and who cannot even for a short time overcome the delicacy of his appetite will never succeed in curbing the secret and more important desires of the body; (2) because it sometimes happens that at the time our host is out of that particular thing which we ask for, and we make him feel ashamed of the wants and bareness of his table, by exposing his poverty which he would rather was only known to God; (3) because sometimes other people do not care about the relish which we ask for, and so it turns out that we are annoying most of them while intent on satisfying the desires of our own palate. And on this account we must by all means avoid such a liberty. Of fornication there are three sorts: (1) that which is accomplished by sexual intercourse; (2) that which takes place without touching a woman, for which we read that Onan the son of the patriarch Judah was smitten by the Lord; and which is termed by Scripture uncleanness: of which the Apostle says: &#8220;But I say to the unmarried and to widows, that it is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they do not contain let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1329"></A><A HREF="#fn_1329"><FONT SIZE="1">1330</FONT></A>
 (3) that which is conceived in heart and mind, of which the Lord says in the gospel: &#8220;Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1330"></A><A HREF="#fn_1330"><FONT SIZE="1">1331</FONT></A>
 And these three kinds the blessed Apostle tells us must be stamped out in one and the same way. &#8220;Mortify,&#8221; says he, &#8220;your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, lust, etc.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1331"></A><A HREF="#fn_1331"><FONT SIZE="1">1332</FONT></A>
 And again of two of them he says to the Ephesians: &#8220;Let fornication and uncleanness be not so much as named among you:&#8221; and once more: &#8220;But know this that no fornicator or unclean person, or covetous person who is an idolater hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1332"></A><A HREF="#fn_1332"><FONT SIZE="1">1333</FONT></A>
 And just as these three must be avoided by us with equal care, so they one and all shut us out and exclude us equally from the kingdom of Christ. Of covetousness there are three kinds: (1) That which hinders renunciants from allowing themselves of be stripped of their goods and property; (2) that which draws us to resume with excessive eagerness the possession of those things which we have given away and distributed to the poor; (3) that which leads a man to covet and procure what he never previously possessed. Of anger there are three kinds: one which rages within, which is called in Greek <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xi-p7.2"></A>&#952;&#965;&#956;&#8057;&#962;</span>; another which breaks out in word and deed and action, which they term <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xi-p7.3"></A>&#8000;</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xi-p7.4"></A>&#961;&#947;&#8053;</span>: of which the Apostle speaks, saying &#8220;But now do ye lay aside all anger and indignation;&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1333"></A><A HREF="#fn_1333"><FONT SIZE="1">1334</FONT></A>
 the third, which is not like those in boiling over and being done with in an hour, but which lasts for days and long periods, which is called <span class="Greek"><a name="iv.iv.vi.xi-p8.2"></A>&#956;&#8134;&#957;&#953;&#962;</span>. And all these three must be condemned by us with equal horror. Of dejection there are two kinds: one, that which springs up when anger has died down, or is the result of some loss we have incurred or of some purpose which has been hindered and interfered with; the other, that which comes from unreasonable anxiety of mind or from despair. Of accidie there are two kinds: one of which sends those affected by it to sleep; while the other makes them forsake their cell and flee away. Of vainglory, although it takes various forms and shapes, and is divided into different classes, yet there are two main kinds: (1) when we are puffed up about carnal things and things visible, and (2) when we are inflamed with the desire of vain praise for things spiritual and unseen.</p>
