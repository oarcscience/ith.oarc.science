<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p2.1"></A>Wherefore</span> if we wish the summit of our building to be perfect and to rise well-pleasing to God, we should endeavour to lay its foundations not in accordance with the desires of our own lust, but according to the rules of evangelical strictness: which can only be the fear of God and humility, proceeding from kindness and simplicity of heart. But humility cannot possibly be acquired without giving up everything: and as long as a man is a stranger to this, he cannot possibly attain the virtue of obedience, or the strength of patience, or the serenity of kindness, or the perfection of love; without which things our hearts cannot possibly be a habitation for the Holy Spirit: as the Lord says through the prophet: &#8220;Upon whom shall My spirit rest, but on him that is humble and quiet and hears My words,&#8221; or according to those copies which express the Hebrew accurately: &#8220;To whom shall I have respect, but to him that is poor and little and of a contrite spirit and that trembleth at My words?&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1081"></A><A HREF="#fn_1081"><FONT SIZE="1">1082</FONT></A>

<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p3"></A> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002">Is. lxvi. 2</a><a name="iv.iii.xii.xxxi-p3.1"></A>. It is noteworthy that Cassian after giving a rendering which differs but slightly from that of the old Latin, as given in Sabbatier&#146;s great work, adds the version of &#8220;those copies which express the Hebrew accurately,&#8221; and thus shows his acquaintance with Jerome&#146;s new translation which he quotes. He does the same thing again in the Conferences, XXIII. viii.; and On the Incarnation Against Nestorius IV. iii.; V. ii., xv. Compare also Institutes VIII. xxi., and Conf. VIII. x.; where he also betrays a knowledge of the Vulgate. As a general rule, however, his translations are taken from the old Latin, or possibly in some cases are made by him from the LXX.</p>
