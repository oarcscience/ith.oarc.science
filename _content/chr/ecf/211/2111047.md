#### <span id="iv.vi.vii.ix-p0.1"></span>Chapter IX.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.ix-p1"></span>Of the care with which a monk should
preserve the recollection of God.

<span id="iv.vi.vii.ix-p2"></span>I <span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.vii.ix-p2.1"></span>should</span> say then that the saints who
keep a firm hold of the recollection of God and are borne along, as it
were, with their steps suspended on a line stretched out on high, may be
rightly compared to rope dancers, commonly called funambuli, who risk
all their safety and life on the path of that very narrow rope, with no
doubt that they will immediately meet with a most dreadful death if
their foot swerves or trips in the very slightest degree, or goes over
the line of the course in which alone is safety. And while with
marvellous skill they ply their airy steps through space, if they keep
not their steps to that all too narrow path with careful and anxious
regulation, the earth which is the natural base and the most solid and
safest foundation for all, becomes to them an immediate and clear
danger, not because its nature is changed, but because they fall
headlong upon it by the <span id="page_525">p. 525</span> <span
id="iv.vi.vii.ix-Page_525"></span>weight of their bodies. So also that
unwearied goodness of God and His unchanging nature <span
id="fr_2260"></span>[2261](#fn_2260) hurts no one indeed, but we
ourselves by falling from on high and tending to the depths are the
authors of our own death, or rather the very fall becomes death to the
faller. For it says: “Woe to them for they have departed from Me: they
shall be wasted because they have transgressed against Me;” and again:
“Woe to them when I shall depart from them.” For “thine own wickedness
shall reprove thee, and thy apostasy shall rebuke thee. Know thou and
see that it is an evil and a bitter thing for thee to have left the Lord
thy God;” for “every man is bound by the cords of his sins.” <span
id="fr_2261"></span>[2262](#fn_2261) To whom this rebuke is aptly
directed by the Lord: “Behold,” He says, “all you that kindle a fire,
encompassed with flames, walk ye in the light of your fire and in the
flames which you have kindled;” and again: “He that kindleth iniquity,
shall perish by it.” <span id="fr_2262"></span>[2263](#fn_2262)
