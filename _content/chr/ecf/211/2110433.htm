<p> <a name="iv.iii.vii.xvii"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xvii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XVII.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xvii-p1"></A>Of the renunciation of the apostles and the primitive church.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xvii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.vii.xvii-p2.1"></A>As</span> if he (who, by his assertion that he was endowed with the privileges of a Roman citizen from his birth, testifies that he was no mean person according to this world&#146;s rank) might not likewise have been supported by the property which formerly belonged to him! And as if those men who were possessors of lands and houses in Jerusalem and sold everything and kept back nothing whatever for themselves, and brought the price of them and laid it at the feet of the apostles, might not have supplied their bodily necessities from their own property, had this been considered the best plan by the apostles, or had they themselves deemed it preferable! But they gave up all their property at once, and preferred to be supported by their own labour, and by the contributions of the Gentiles, of whose collection the holy Apostle speaks in writing to the Romans, and declaring his own office in this matter to them, and urging them on likewise to make this collection: &#8220;But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints who are at Jerusalem: it has pleased them indeed, and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles are made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also to minister to them in carnal things.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">894</FONT></A>
 To the Corinthians also he shows the same anxiety about this, and urges them the more diligently to prepare before his arrival a collection, which he was intending to send for their needs. &#8220;But concerning the collection for the saints, as I appointed to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye. Let each one of you on the first day of the week put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him, that when I come the collections be not then to be made. But when I come whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them I will send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.&#8221; And that he may stimulate them to make a larger collection, he adds, &#8220;But if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">895</FONT></A>
 meaning if your offering is of such a character as  <A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A> <a name="iv.iii.vii.xvii-Page_254"></A>to deserve to be taken there by my ministration. To the Galatians too, he testifies that when he was settling the division of the ministry of preaching with the apostles, he had arranged this with James, Peter, and John: that he should undertake the preaching to the Gentiles, but should never repudiate care and anxious thought for the poor who were at Jerusalem, who for Christ&#146;s sake gave up all their goods, and submitted to voluntary poverty. &#8220;And when they saw,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the grace of God which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and to Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should preach to the Gentiles, but they to those of the circumcision: only they would that we should be mindful of the poor.&#8221; A matter which he testifies that he attended to most carefully, saying, &#8220;which also I was anxious of myself to do.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">896</FONT></A>
 Who then are the more blessed, those who but lately were gathered out of the number of the heathen, and being unable to climb to the heights of the perfection of the gospel, clung to their own property, in whose case it was considered a great thing by the Apostle if at least they were restrained from the worship of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">897</FONT></A>
 and had embraced the faith of Christ, with their goods and all: or those who live up to the demands of the gospel, and carry the Lord&#146;s cross daily, and want nothing out of their property to remain for their own use? And if the blessed Apostle himself, bound with chains and fetters, or hampered by the difficulties of travelling, and for these reasons not being able to provide with his hands, as he generally did, for the supply of his food, declares that he received that which supplied his wants from the brethren who came from Macedonia; &#8220;For that which was lacking to me,&#8221; he says, &#8220;the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">898</FONT></A>
 and to the Philippians he says: &#8220;For ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I came from Macedonia, no church communicated with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; because even in Thessalonica once and again you sent to supply my needs:&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">899</FONT></A>
 (if this was so) then, according to the notion of these men, which they have formed in the coldness of their heart, will those men really be more blessed than the Apostle, because it is found that they have ministered to him of their substance? But this no one will venture to assert, however big a fool he may be.</p>
