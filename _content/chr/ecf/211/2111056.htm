<p> <a name="iv.vi.vii.xviii"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xviii-p0.1"></A>Chapter XVIII.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xviii-p1"></A>That even good and holy men are not without sin.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xviii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.vii.xviii-p2.1"></A>But</span> that no one however holy is in this life free from trespasses and sin, we are told also by the teaching of the Saviour, who gave His disciples the form of the perfect prayer and among those other sublime and sacred commands, which as they were only given to the saints and perfect cannot apply to the wicked and unbelievers, He bade this to be inserted: &#8220;And forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2286"></A><A HREF="#fn_2286"><FONT SIZE="1">2287</FONT></A>
 If then this is offered as a true prayer and by saints, as we ought without the shadow of a doubt to believe, who can be found so obstinate and impudent, so puffed up with the pride of the devil&#146;s own rage, as to maintain that he is without sin, and not only to think himself greater than apostles, but also to charge the Saviour Himself with ignorance or folly, as if He either did not know that some men could be free from debts, or was idly teaching those whom He knew to stand in no need of the remedy of that prayer? But since all the saints who altogether keep the commands of their King, say every day &#8220;Forgive us our debts,&#8221; if they speak the truth there is indeed no one free from sin, but if they speak falsely, it is equally true that they are not free from the sin of falsehood. Wherefore also that most wise Ecclesiastes reviewing in his mind all the actions and purposes of men declares without any exception: &#8220;that there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2287"></A><A HREF="#fn_2287"><FONT SIZE="1">2288</FONT></A>
 i.e., no one ever could or ever will be found on this earth so holy, so diligent, so earnest as to be able continually to cling to that true and unique good, and not day after day to feel that he is drawn aside from it and fails. But still though he maintains that he cannot be free from wrong doing, yet none the less we must not deny that he is righteous.</p>
