#### <span id="iv.v.ii.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.v.ii.v-p1"></span>Of our answer to his excuse.

<span id="iv.v.ii.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.v-p2.1"></span>At</span> this we were overwhelmed with no
slight confusion and replied as follows: Although both the difficulty of
the place and the solitary life itself, which even a robust youth could
scarcely put up with, ought to be sufficient to teach us everything (and
indeed without your saying anything they *do* teach and impress us a
very great deal) yet still we ask you to lay aside your silence for a
little and in a more worthy manner implant in us those principles by
which we may be able to embrace, not so much by imitating it as by
admiring it, that goodness which we see in you. For even if our coldness
is known to you, and does not deserve to obtain what we are asking for,
yet at least the trouble of so long a journey ought to be repaid by it,
as we made haste to come here after our first beginning in the monastery
of Bethlehem, owing to a longing for your instruction, and a yearning
for our own good.
