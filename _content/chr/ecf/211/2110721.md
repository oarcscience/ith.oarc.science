#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xii-p1"></span>The answer how it is that unclean
spirits can lord it over those possessed.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xii-p2.1"></span>Serenus</span>: What you speak of as
taking place in the case of demoniacs is not opposed to our assertion;
viz., that those possessed by unclean spirits say and do what they do
not want to, and are forced to utter what they know not; for it is
perfectly clear that they are not subject to the entrance of the spirits
all in the same way: for some are affected by them in such a way as to
have not the slightest conception of what they do and say, while others
know and afterwards recollect it. But we must not imagine that this is
done by the infusion of the spirit in such a way that it penetrates into
the actual substance of the soul and, being as it were united to it and
somehow clothed with it, utters words and sayings through the mouth of
the sufferer. For we ought not to believe that this can possibly be done
by them. For we can clearly see that this results from no loss of the
soul but from weakness of the body, when the unclean spirit seizes on
those members in which the vigour of the soul resides, and laying on
them an enormous and intolerable weight overwhelms it with foulest
darkness, and interferes with its intellectual powers: as we see
sometimes happen also from the fault of wine and fever or excessive
cold, and other indispositions affecting men from without; and it was
this which the devil was forbidden to attempt to inflict on the blessed
Job, though he had received power over his flesh, when the Lord
commanded him saying: “Lo, I give him into thine hands: only preserve
his soul,” <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469) i.e., do not
weaken the seat of his soul and make him mad, and overpower the
understanding and wisdom of what remains, by smothering the ruling power
in his heart with your weight.
