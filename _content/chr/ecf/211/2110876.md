#### <span id="iv.v.v.xvi-p0.1"></span>Chapter XVI.

<span id="iv.v.v.xvi-p1"></span>The answer to the effect that bad men
cannot possess true knowledge.

<span id="iv.v.v.xvi-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.xvi-p2.1"></span>Nesteros</span>: One who does not carefully
weigh every word of the opinions uttered cannot rightly discover the
value of the assertion. For we said to begin with that men of this sort
only possess skill in disputation and ornaments of speech; but cannot
penetrate to the very heart of Scripture and the mysteries of its
spiritual meanings. For true knowledge is only acquired by true
worshippers of God; and certainly this people does not possess it to
whom it is said: “Hear, O, foolish people, thou who hast no heart: ye
who having eyes see not, and having ears, hear not.” And again: “Because
thou hast rejected knowledge, I also will reject thee from acting as My
priest.” <span id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910) For as it is said
that in Christ “all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are
hid,” <span id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911) how can we hold that he
who has scorned to find Christ, or, when He is found blasphemes Him with
impious lips, or at least defiles the Catholic faith by his impure
deeds, has acquired spiritual knowledge? “For the Spirit of God will
avoid deception, and dwelleth not in a body that is subject to
sin.” <span id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912) There is then no way of
arriving at spiritual knowledge but this which one of the prophets has
finely described: “Sow to yourselves for righteousness: reap the hope of
life. Enlighten yourselves with the light of knowledge.” <span
id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913) First then we must sow for
righteousness, i.e., by works of righteousness we must extend practical
perfection; next we must reap the hope of life, i.e., by the expulsion
of carnal sins must gather the fruits of spiritual virtues: and so we
shall succeed in enlightening ourselves with the light of knowledge. And
the Psalmist also sees that this system ought to be followed, when he
says: “Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way: who walk in the
law of the Lord. Blessed are they that seek His testimonies.” <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914) For he does not say in the first
place: “Blessed are they that seek His testimonies, and afterwards add:
Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way;” but he begins by
saying: “Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way;” and by this
clearly shows that no one can properly come to seek God’s testimonies
unless he first walks undefiled in the way of Christ by his practical
life. Those therefore whom you mentioned do not possess that knowledge
which the impure cannot attain, but <span class="Greek"><span
id="iv.v.v.xvi-p7.2"></span>ψευδώνυμον</span> , i.e., what is falsely so
called, of which the blessed Apostle speaks: “O Timothy, keep that which
is committed to thee, avoiding profane novelties of words, and
oppositions of the knowledge that is falsely so called;” <span
id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915) which is in the Greek <span
class="Greek"><span id="iv.v.v.xvi-p8.2"></span>τάς ἀντιθέσεις τῆς
ψευδωνύμου γνώσεως</span>. Of those then who seem to acquire some show
of knowledge or of those who while they devote themselves diligently to
reading the sacred volume and to committing the Scriptures to memory,
yet forsake not carnal sins, it is well said in Proverbs: “Like as a
golden ring in a swine’s snout so is the beauty of an evil-disposed
woman.” <span id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916) For what does it
profit a man to gain the ornaments of heavenly eloquence and the most
precious beauty of the Scriptures if by clinging to filthy deeds and
thoughts he destroys it by burying it in the foulest ground, or defiles
it by the dirty wallowing of his own lusts? For the result will be that
which is an ornament to those who rightly use it, is not only unable to
adorn them, but actually becomes dirty by the increased filth and mud.
For “from the mouth of a sinner praise is not comely;” <span
id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917) as to him it is said by the
prophet: “Wherefore dost thou declare My righteous acts, and takest My
covenant in thy lips?” <span id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918) of
souls like this, who never possess in any lasting fashion the fear of
the Lord of which it is said: “the fear of the Lord is instruction and
wisdom,” <span id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919) and yet try to get
at the meaning of Scripture by continual meditation on them, it is
appropriately asked in Proverbs: “What use are riches to a fool? For a
senseless man cannot possess wisdom.” <span
id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920) But so far is this true and
spiritual knowledge removed from that worldly erudition, which is
defiled by the stains of carnal sins, that we know that it has sometimes
flourished most grandly in some who were without eloquence and almost
illiterate. And this is very clearly shown by the case of the Apostles
and many holy men, who did not spread themselves out with an empty show
of leaves, but were bowed down by the weight of the true fruits of
spiritual <span id="page_444">p. 444</span> <span
id="iv.v.v.xvi-Page_444"></span>knowledge: of whom it is written in the
Acts of the Apostles: “But when they saw the boldness of Peter and John,
and perceived that they were ignorant and unlearned men, they were
astonished.” <span id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921) And therefore if
you are anxious to attain to that never-failing fragrance, you must
first strive with all your might to obtain from the Lord the purity of
chastity. For no one, in whom the love of carnal passions and especially
of fornication still holds sway, can acquire spiritual knowledge. For
“in a good heart wisdom will rest;” and: “He that feareth the Lord shall
find knowledge with righteousness.” <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922) But that we must attain to
spiritual knowledge in the order of which we have already spoken, we are
taught also by the blessed Apostle. For when he wanted not merely to
draw up a list of all his own virtues, but rather to describe their
order, that he might explain which follows what, and which gives birth
to what, after some others he proceeds as follows: “In watchings, in
fastings, in chastity, in knowledge, in long suffering, in gentleness,
in the Holy Ghost, in love unfeigned.” <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[1924](#fn_1923) And by this enumeration of virtues
he evidently meant to teach us that we must come from watchings and
fastings to chastity, from chastity to knowledge, from knowledge to long
suffering, from long suffering to gentleness, from gentleness to the
Holy Ghost, from the Holy Ghost to the rewards of love unfeigned. When
then by this system and in this order you too have come to spiritual
knowledge, you will certainly have, as we said, not barren or idle
learning but what is vigorous and fruitful; and the seed of the word of
salvation which has been committed by you to the hearts of your hearers,
will be watered by the plentiful showers of the Holy Ghost that will
follow; and, according to this that the prophet promised, “the rain will
be given to your seed, wherever you shall sow in the land, and the bread
of the corn of the land shall be most plentiful and fat.” <span
