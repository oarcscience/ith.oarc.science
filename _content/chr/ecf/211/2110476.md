#### <span id="iv.iii.ix.v-p0.1"></span>Chapter V.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.v-p1"></span>That disturbances are caused in us not
by the faults of other people, but by our own.

<span id="iv.iii.ix.v-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.ix.v-p2.1"></span>Whence</span> it is clearly proved that the
pains of disturbances are not always caused in us by other people’s
faults, but rather by our own, as we have stored up in ourselves the
causes of offence, and the seeds of faults, which, as soon as a shower
of temptation waters our soul, at once burst forth into shoots and
fruits.

destroyed by falling through a long course of carelessness.](2110477)
