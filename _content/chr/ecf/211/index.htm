<A HREF="2111166.htm">Chapter XV. He shows that those who patronize this false teaching acknowledge two Christs.</A><BR>

<A HREF="2111168.htm">Chapter XVII. Those who are under an error in one point of the Catholic religion, lose the whole faith, and all the value of the faith.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111169.htm">Chapter XVIII. He directs his discourse upon his antagonist with whom he is disputing, and begs him to return to his senses. The sacrament of reconciliation is necessary for the lapsed for their salvation.</A><BR>

<A HREF="2111171.htm">Chapter XX. He shows from what has been said that we do not mean that God was mortal or of flesh before the worlds, although Christ, who is God from eternity and was made man in time, is but one Person.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111172.htm">Chapter XXI. The authority of Holy Scripture teaches that Christ existed from all eternity.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111173.htm">Chapter XXII. The hypostatic union enables us to ascribe to God what belongs to the flesh in Christ.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111174.htm">Chapter XXIII. That the figure Synecdoche, in which the part stands for the whole, is very familiar to the Holy Scripture.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111175.htm">Book VII.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111176.htm">Chapter I. As he is going to reply to the slanders of his opponents he implores the aid of Divine grace to teach a prayer to be used by those who undertake to dispute with heretics.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111177.htm">Chapter II. He meets the objection taken from these words: No one gave birth to one who had existed before her.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111178.htm">Chapter III. He replies to the cavil that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who bears.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111179.htm">Chapter IV. How God has shown His Omnipotence in His birth in time as well as in everything else.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111180.htm">Chapter V. He shows by proofs drawn from nature itself, that the law which his opponents lay down; viz., that the one born ought to be of one substance with the one who bears, fails to hold good in many cases.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111181.htm">Chapter VI. He refutes another argument of Nestorius, in which he tried to make out that Christ was like Adam in every point.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111182.htm">Chapter VII. Heretics usually cover their doctrines with a cloak of holy Scripture.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111183.htm">Chapter VIII. The heretics attribute to Christ only the shadow of Divinity, and so assert that he is to be worshipped together with God but not as God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111184.htm">Chapter IX. How those are wrong who say that the birth of Christ was a secret, since it was clearly shown even to the patriarch Jacob.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111185.htm">Chapter X. He collects more witnesses of the same fact.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111186.htm">Chapter XI. How the devil was forced by many reasons to the view that Christ was God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111187.htm">Chapter XII. He compares this notion and reasonable suspicion of the devil with the obstinate and inflexible idea of his opponents, and shows that this last is worse and more blasphemous than the former.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111188.htm">Chapter XIII. How the devil always retained this notion of Christ's Divinity (because of His secret working which he experienced) even up to His Cross and Death.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111189.htm">Chapter XIV. He shows how heretics pervert holy Scripture, by replying to the argument drawn from the Apostle's words, &#8220;Without father, without mother,&#8221; etc.: Heb. vii.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111190.htm">Chapter XV. How Christ could be said by the Apostle to be without genealogy.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111191.htm">Chapter XVI. He shows that like the devil when tempting Christ, the heretics garble and pervert holy Scripture.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111192.htm">Chapter XVII. That the glory and honour of Christ is not to be ascribed to the Holy Ghost in such a way as to deny that it proceeds from Christ Himself, as if all that excellency, which was in Him, was another's and proceeded from another source.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111193.htm">Chapter XVIII. How we are to understand the Apostle's words: &#8220;He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit,&#8221; etc.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111194.htm">Chapter XIX. That it was not only the Spirit, but Christ Himself also who made Him to be feared.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111195.htm">Chapter XX. He tries by stronger and weightier arguments to destroy that notion.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111196.htm">Chapter XXI. That it must be ascribed equally to Christ and the Holy Ghost that His flesh and Humanity became the temple of God.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111197.htm">Chapter XXII. That the raising up of Christ into heaven is not to be ascribed to the Spirit alone.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111198.htm">Chapter XXIII. He continues the same argument to show that Christ had no need of another's glory as He had a glory of His own.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111199.htm">Chapter XXIV. He supports this doctrine by the authority of the blessed Hilary.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111200.htm">Chapter XXV. He shows that Ambrose agrees with S. Hilary.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111201.htm">Chapter XXVI. He adds to the foregoing the testimony of S. Jerome.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111202.htm">Chapter XXVII. To the foregoing he adds Rufinus and the blessed Augustine.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111203.htm">Chapter XXVIII. As he is going to produce the testimony of Greek or Eastern Bishops, he brings forward in the first place S. Gregory Nazianzen.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111204.htm">Chapter XXIX. In the next place he puts the authority of S. Athanasius.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111205.htm">Chapter XXX. He adds also S. John Chrysostom.</A><BR>
<A HREF="2111206.htm">Chapter XXXI. He bemoans the unhappy lot of Constantinople, owing to the misfortune which has overtaken it from that heretic; and at the same time he urges the citizens to stand fast in the ancient Catholic and ancestral faith.</A><BR>
