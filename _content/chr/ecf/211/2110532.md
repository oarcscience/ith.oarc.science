#### <span id="iv.iii.xii.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.i-p1"></span>How our eighth combat is against the
spirit of pride, and of its character.

<span id="iv.iii.xii.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.xii.i-p2.1"></span>Our</span> eighth and last combat is
against the spirit of pride, which evil, although it is the latest in
our conflict with our faults and stands last on the list, yet in
beginning and in the order of time is the first: an evil beast that is
most savage and more dreadful than all the former ones, chiefly trying
those who are perfect, and devouring with its dreadful bite those who
have almost attained the consummation of virtue.
