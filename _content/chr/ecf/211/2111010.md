#### <span id="iv.vi.v.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.vi.v.x-p1"></span>An explanation that we may not appear to
recommend separation from wives.

<span id="iv.vi.v.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.x-p2.1"></span>But</span> let no one imagine that we have
invented this for the sake of encouraging divorce, as we not only in no
way condemn marriage, but also, following the words of the Apostle, say:
“Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled,” <span
id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183) but it was in order faithfully to
show the reader the origin of the conversion by which this great man was
dedicated to God. And I ask the reader kindly, to allow that, whether he
likes this or no, in either case I am free from blame, and to give the
praise or blame for this act to its real author. But as for me, as I
have not put forward an opinion of my own on this matter, but have given
a simple narration of the history of the facts, it is fair that as I
claim no praise from those who approve of what was done, so I should not
be attacked by the hatred of those who disapprove of it. Let every man
therefore, as we said, have his own opinion on the matter. But I advise
him to restrain his censure in considering it, lest he come to fancy
that he is more just and holy than the Divine judgment, whereby the
signs even of Apostolic virtue were conferred upon him (viz., Theonas),
not to mention the opinion of such great fathers by whom it is clear
that his action was not only not blamed, but even so far praised that in
the election to the office of almoner they preferred him to splendid and
most excellent men. And I fancy that the judgment of so many spiritual
men, uttered with God as its author, was not wrong, as it was, as was
said above, confirmed by such wonderful signs.
