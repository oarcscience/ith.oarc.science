<p> <a name="ii.iv.i.xxvi"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="ii.iv.i.xxvi-p0.1"></A>Chapter XXVI.</h4>  
<p class="skip"><a name="ii.iv.i.xxvi-p1"></A>&#8220;<span class="sc"><a name="ii.iv.i.xxvi-p1.1"></A>Why</span> do you,&#8221; here exclaimed Postumianus, &#8220;speak to me in such a manner? As if I did not hold the same opinion as yourself, and had not always been of the same mind. I, indeed, as long as I live, and retain my senses, will ever celebrate the monks of Egypt: I will praise the anchorites; I will admire the eremites; but I will place Martin in a position of his own: I do not venture to compare to him any one of the monks, far less any of the bishops. Egypt owns this: Syria and &AElig;thiopia have discovered this: India has heard this; Parthia and Persia have known this; not even Armenia is ignorant of it; the remote Bosphorus is aware of it; and in a word, those are acquainted with it who visit the Fortunate Islands or the Arctic Ocean. All the more wretched on this account is this country of ours, which has not been found worthy to be acquainted with so great a man, although he was in its immediate vicinity. However, I will  <A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A> <a name="ii.iv.i.xxvi-Page_37"></A>not include the people at large in this censure: only the clerics, only the priests know nothing of him; and not without reason were they, in their ill-will, disinclined to know him, inasmuch as, had they become acquainted with his virtues they must have recognized their own vices. I shudder to state what I have lately heard, that a miserable man (I know him not), has said that you have told many lies in that book of yours. This is not the voice of a man, but of the devil; and it is not Martin who is, in this way, injured, but faith is taken from the Gospels themselves. For, since the Lord himself testified of works of the kind which Martin accomplished, that they were to be performed by all the faithful, he who does not believe that Martin accomplished such deeds, simply does not believe that Christ uttered such words. But the miserable, the degenerate, the somnolent, are put to shame, that the things which they themselves cannot do, were done by him, and prefer rather to deny his virtues than to confess their own inertness. But let us, as we hasten on to other matters, let go all remembrance of such persons: and do you rather, as I have for a long time desired, proceed to narrate the still untold deeds of Martin.&#8221;</p>  
<p><a name="ii.iv.i.xxvi-p2"></A>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I think that your request would more properly be directed to our friend the Gaul, since he is acquainted with more of Martin&#146;s doings than I am&#8212;for a disciple could not be ignorant of the deeds of his master&#8212;and who certainly owes a return of kindness, not only to Martin, but to both of us, inasmuch as I have already published my book, and you have, so far, related to us the doings of our brethren in the East. Let then, our friend the Gaul commence that detailed account which is due from him: because, as I have said, he both owes us a return in the way of speaking, and will, I believe, do this much for his friend Martin&#8212;that he shall, not unwillingly, give a narrative of his deeds.&#8221;</p>
