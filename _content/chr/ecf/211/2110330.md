#### <span id="iv.iii.iv.i-p0.1"></span>Chapter I.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.i-p1"></span>Of the training of those who renounce
this world, and of the way in which those are taught among the monks of
Tabenna and the Egyptians who are received into the monasteries.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.i-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.iv.i-p2.1"></span>From</span> the canonical system of Psalms
and prayers which ought to be observed in the daily services throughout
the monasteries, we pass, in the due course of our narrative, to the
training of one who renounces this world; endeavouring first, as well as
we can, to embrace, in a short account, the terms on which those who
desire to turn to the Lord can be received in the monasteries; adding
some things from the rule of the Egyptians, some from that of the monks
of Tabenna, <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756) whose monastery in
the Thebaid is better filled as regards numbers, as it is stricter in
the rigour of its system, than all others, for there are in it more than
five thousand brethren under the rule of one Abbot; and the obedience
with which the whole number of monks is at all times subject to one
Elder is what no one among us would render to another even for a short
time, or would demand from him.

<span id="iv.iii.iv.i-p3"></span> Tabenna, or Tabennæ, was an island in
the Nile, where was founded a flourishing monastery by Pachomius c. 330
<span class="sc"><span id="iv.iii.iv.i-p3.1"></span>a.d</span>. Of
Pachomius there is a notice in Sozomen H. E. Book III. c. xiv., and his
Rule was translated into Latin, with a preface by S. Jerome who mentions
his fame in *Ep*. cxxvii. There is a Life of Pachomius given by Rosweyde
(*Vitæ Patrum*), which is said to be a translation of a work by a
contemporary of his.
