<p class="endnote"><a name="iv.iii.iv.v-p3"></A> So the Rule of Pachomius (c. xxvi.) orders that on the admission of a monk &#8220;they shall strip him of his secular dress, and put on him the garb of the monks;&#8221; and that of S. Benedict (c. lviii.), &#8220;He shall then be clothed in the religious habit, and his secular clothes deposited in the wardrobe, that if, at the instigation of the devil, he should ever leave the monastery, they may be given back to him, and the religious dress be taken from him.&#8221;</p>
