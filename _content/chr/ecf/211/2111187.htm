<p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xii-p1"></A>He compares this notion and reasonable suspicion of the devil with the obstinate and inflexible idea of his opponents, and shows that this last is worse and more blasphemous than the former.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xii-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.viii.xii-p2.1"></A>But</span> he certainly knew that the Lord Jesus Christ was born of Mary: he knew that He was wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger: that His childhood was that of a poor person at the commencement of His human life; and His infancy without the proper accessories of cradles: further he did not doubt that He had true flesh, and was born a true man. And why did this seem to him not enough for him to be secure in? Why did he believe that He could not be God, whom he knew to be very man? Learn then, you wretched madman, learn, you lunatic, you cruel sinner, learn, I pray, even from the devil, to lessen your blasphemy. He said: &#8220;If Thou art the Son of God.&#8221; You say: &#8220;Thou art not the Son of God.&#8221; You deny what he asked about. No one was ever yet found but you, to outdo the devil in blasphemy. That which he confessed to be possible in the case of the Lord, you do not believe to have been possible.</p>
