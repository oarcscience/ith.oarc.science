#### <span id="iv.iii.i.iii-p0.1"></span>Chapter III.

<span id="iv.iii.i.iii-p1"></span>Of the Hoods of the Egyptians.

<span id="iv.iii.i.iii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iii.i.iii-p2.1"></span>There</span> are some things besides in
the dress of the Egyptians which concern not the care of the body so
much as the regulation of the character, that the observance of
simplicity and innocence may be preserved by the very character of the
clothing. For they constantly use both by day and by night very small
hoods coming down to the end of the neck and shoulders, which only cover
the head, in order that they may constantly be moved to preserve the
simplicity and innocence of little children by imitating their actual
dress. <span id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645)  And <span
id="page_203">p. 203</span> <span
id="iv.iii.i.iii-Page_203"></span>these men have returned to childhood
in Christ and sing at all hours with heart and soul: “Lord, my heart is
not exalted nor are mine eyes lofty. Neither have I walked in great
matters nor in wonderful things above me. If I was not humbly minded,
but exalted my soul: as a child that is weaned is towards his
mother.” <span id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646)

<span id="iv.iii.i.iii-p3"></span> The hood, or cowl (cuculla), was
anciently worn by children and peasants, and thus was said to symbolize
humility. Compare the account of the Egyptian monks given by Sozomen,
*Hist*. III. xiv.: “They wore a covering on their heads called a cowl to
show that they ought to live with the same innocence and purity as
infants who are nourished with milk and wear a covering of the same
form.”
