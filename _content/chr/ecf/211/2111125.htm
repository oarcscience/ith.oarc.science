<p> <a name="iv.vii.v.iv"></A>  <h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vii.v.iv-p0.1"></A>Chapter IV.</h4>  
<p class="subh"><a name="iv.vii.v.iv-p1"></A>He brings forward other testimonies to the same view.</p>  
<p class="skip"><a name="iv.vii.v.iv-p2"></A><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vii.v.iv-p2.1"></A>If</span> you would know how admirably the Apostle preached this, hear how this utterance was put into his mouth; as if from the mouth of God Himself, as the Lord says: &#8220;For God sent not His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2451"></A><A HREF="#fn_2451"><FONT SIZE="1">2452</FONT></A>
 For lo, as you see, the Lord Himself affirms that He was sent by God the Father to save mankind. But if you think that it ought to be shown still more clearly, what Son God sent to save men,&#8212;though God&#146;s own and only begotten can only be one, and when God is said to have sent His Son, He is certainly shown to have sent His only begotten Son,&#8212;yet hear the prophet David pointing out with the utmost clearness Him who was sent for the salvation of Men. &#8220;He sent,&#8221; said he, &#8220;His Word and healed them.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2452"></A><A HREF="#fn_2452"><FONT SIZE="1">2453</FONT></A>
 Can you twist this so as to refer it to the flesh as if you could say that a mere man was sent by God to heal mankind? You certainly cannot, for the prophet David and all the holy Scriptures would cry out against you, saying, &#8220;He sent His Word and healed them.&#8221; You see then, that the Word was sent to heal men, for though healing was given through Christ, yet the Word of God was in Christ, and healed all things through Christ: and so since Christ and the Word were united in the mystery of the Incarnation, Christ and the Word of God became one Son of God in either substance. And when the Apostle John was anxious to state this clearly, he said &#8220;God sent His Son to be the Saviour of the world.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2453"></A><A HREF="#fn_2453"><FONT SIZE="1">2454</FONT></A>
 Do you see how he joined together God and man in an union that cannot be severed? For Christ who was born of Mary is without the slightest doubt called Saviour, as it is said, &#8220;For to you is born this day a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2454"></A><A HREF="#fn_2454"><FONT SIZE="1">2455</FONT></A>
 But here he calls the very Word of God, which was sent, a Saviour, saying: &#8220;God sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.&#8221;</p>
