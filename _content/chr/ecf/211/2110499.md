applying a suitable remedy to the incentive to so many faults, and
laying aside that apostolic power of his which he had made use of a
little before, he adopts once more the tender character of a good
father, or of a kind physician, and, as if they were his children or his
patients, applies by his healing counsel remedies to cure them, saying:
“Now we charge them that are such, and beseech them by the Lord Jesus,
that working with silence they would eat their own bread.” The cause of
all these ulcers, which spring from the root of idleness, he heals like
some well-skilled physician by a single salutary charge to work; as he
knows that all the other bad symptoms, which spring as it were from the
same clump, will at once disappear when the cause of the chief malady
has been removed.

the reading which Petschenig gives, *operatio manuum*, is clearly so.
