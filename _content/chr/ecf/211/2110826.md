#### <span id="iv.v.ii.ii-p0.1"></span>Chapter II.

<span id="iv.v.ii.ii-p1"></span>Of Bishop Archebius.

<span id="iv.v.ii.ii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.ii.ii-p2.1"></span>And</span> when we arrived there, God
gratified our wishes, and had brought about the arrival of that most
blessed and excellent man Bishop Archebius, <span
id="fr_1686"></span>[1687](#fn_1686) who had been carried off from the
assembly of anchorites and given as Bishop to the town of
Panephysis, <span id="fr_1687"></span>[1688](#fn_1687) and who kept all
his life long to his purpose of solitude with such strictness that he
relaxed nothing of the character of his former humility, nor flattered
himself on the honour that had been added to him (for he vowed that he
had not been summoned to that office as fit for it, but complained that
he had been expelled from the monastic system as unworthy of it because
though he had spent thirty-seven years in it he had never been able to
arrive at the purity so high a profession demands); he then when he had
received us kindly and most graciously in the aforesaid Thennesus
whither the business of electing a Bishop there had brought him, as soon
as he heard of our wish and desire to inquire of the holy fathers even
in still more remote parts of Egypt: “Come,” said he, “see in the
meanwhile the old men who live not far from our monastery, the length of
whose service is shown by their bent bodies, as their holiness shines
forth in their appearance, so that even the mere sight of them will give
a great lesson to those who see them: and from them you can learn not so
much by their words as by the actual example of their holy life, what I
grieve that I have lost, and having lost cannot give to you. But I think
that my poverty will be somewhat lessened by this zeal of mine, if when
you are seeking that pearl of the Gospel which I have not, I at least
provide where you can conveniently procure it.”

<span id="iv.v.ii.ii-p3"></span> Archebius has already been mentioned in
Conference VII. xxvi; and in the Institutes V. xxxvii., xxxviii., two
stories are told illustrative of his kindness and goodness of
disposition; but he is not known to us from any other source except
Cassian’s writings.
