#### <span id="iv.v.v.x-p0.1"></span>Chapter X.

<span id="iv.v.v.x-p1"></span>How to embrace the system of true
knowledge.

<span id="iv.v.v.x-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.v.x-p2.1"></span>You</span> must then, if you want to get at
the true knowledge of the Scriptures, endeavour <span id="page_440">p.
440</span> <span id="iv.v.v.x-Page_440"></span>first to secure steadfast
humility of heart, to carry you on by the perfection of love not to the
knowledge which puffeth up, but to that which enlightens. For it is an
impossibility for an impure mind to gain the gift of spiritual
knowledge. And therefore with every possible care avoid this, lest
through your zeal for reading there arise in you not the light of
knowledge nor the lasting glory which is promised through the light that
comes from learning but only the instruments of your destruction from
vain arrogance. Next you must by all means strive to get rid of all
anxiety and worldly thoughts, and give yourself over assiduously or
rather continuously, to sacred reading, until continual meditation fills
your heart, and fashions you so to speak after its own likeness, making
of it, in a way, an ark of the testimony, <span
id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891) which has within it two tables of
stone, i.e., the constant assurance of the two testaments; <span
id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892) and a golden pot, i.e., a pure and
undefiled memory which preserves by a constant tenacity the manna stored
up in it, i.e., the enduring and heavenly sweetness of the spiritual
sense and the bread of angels; moreover also the rod of Aaron, i.e., the
saving standard of Jesus Christ our true High Priest, that ever buds
with the freshness of immortal memory. For this is the rod which after
it had been cut from the root of Jesse, died and flourished again with a
more vigorous life. But all these are guarded by two Cherubim, i.e., the
fulness of historical and spiritual knowledge. For the Cherubim mean a
multitude of knowledge: and these continually protect the mercy seat of
God, i.e., the peace of your heart, and overshadow it from all the
assaults of spiritual wickedness. And so your soul will be carried
forward not only to the ark of the Divine Covenant, but also to the
priestly kingdom, and owing to its unbroken love of purity being as it
were engrossed in spiritual studies, will fulfil the command given to
the priests, enjoined as follows by the giver of the Law: “And he shall
not go forth from the sanctuary, lest he pollute the Sanctuary of
God,” <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893) i.e., his heart, in
which the Lord promised that he would ever dwell, saying: “I will dwell
in them and will walk among them.” <span
id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894) Wherefore the whole series of the
Holy Scriptures should be diligently committed to memory and ceaselessly
repeated. For this continual meditation will bring us a twofold fruit:
first, that while the attention of the mind is taken up in reading and
preparing the lessons it cannot possibly be taken captive in any snares
of bad thoughts: next that those things which were conned over and
frequently repeated and which while we were trying to commit them to
memory we could not understand as the mind was at that time taken up, we
can afterward see more clearly, when we are free from the distraction of
all acts and visions, and especially when we reflect on them in silence
in our meditation by night. So that when we are at rest, and as it were
plunged in the stupor of sleep, there is revealed to us the
understanding of the most secret meanings, of which in our waking hours
we had not the remotest conception.

Tertullian, who uses it more than once of the two Testaments, e.g.,
Apol. xix.; and, Against Marcion iv. where he speaks of the “Two
Instruments, or, as it is usual to speak of the Two Testaments.”
