#### <span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p0.1"></span>Chapter IV.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p1"></span>Of the three sorts of monks which there
are in Egypt.

<span id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.ii.iv-p2.1"></span>Wherefore</span> you should first hear how
or whence the system and beginning of our order took its rise. For only
then can a man at all effectually be trained in any art he may wish, and
be urged on to practise it diligently, when he has learnt the glory of
its authors and founders. There are three kinds of monks in Egypt, of
which two are admirable, the third is a poor sort of thing and by all
means to be avoided. The first is that of the *Cœnobites*, who live
together in a congregation and are governed by the direction of a single
Elder: and of this kind there is the largest number of monks dwelling
throughout the whole of Egypt. The second is that of the *anchorites*,
who were first trained in the Cœnobium and then being made perfect in
practical life chose the recesses of the desert: and in this order we
also hope to gain a place. The third is the reprehensible one of the
*Sarabaites*. <span id="fr_2073"></span>[2074](#fn_2073) And of these we
will discourse more fully one by one in order. Of these three orders
then you ought, as we said, first to know about the founders. For at
once from this there may arise either a hatred for the order which is to
be avoided, or a longing for that which is to be followed, because each
way is sure to carry the man who follows it, to that end which its
author and discoverer has reached.
