#### <span id="iv.vi.v.xxxii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XXXII.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxxii-p1"></span>The answer on the difference between
grace and the commands of the law.

<span id="iv.vi.v.xxxii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.vi.v.xxxii-p2.1"></span>Theonas</span>: Your inquiry once more
raises before us a question of no small extent. The explanation of which
though I know that it cannot be taught to or understood by the
inexperienced, yet as far as I can, I will try to set forth in words and
briefly to explain, if only your minds will follow up and act upon what
we say. For whatever is known not by teaching but by experience, just as
it cannot be taught by one without experience, so neither can it be
grasped or taken in by the mind of one who has not laid the foundation
by a similar study and training. And therefore I think it necessary for
us first to inquire somewhat carefully what is the purpose or meaning of
the law, and what is the system and perfection of grace, that from this
we may succeed in understanding the dominion of sin and how to drive it
out. And so the law chiefly commands men to seek the bonds of wedlock,
saying: “Blessed is he that hath seed in Sion and an household in
Jerusalem;” <span id="fr_2216"></span>[2217](#fn_2216) and: “Cursed is
the barren that hath not borne.” <span
id="fr_2217"></span>[2218](#fn_2217) On the other hand grace invites us
to the purity of perpetual chastity, and the undefiled state of blessed
virginity, saying: “Blessed are the barren, and the breasts which have
not given suck;” and: “he that hateth not father and mother and wife
cannot be my disciple;” and this of the Apostle: “It remaineth that they
that have wives be as though they had them not.” <span
id="fr_2218"></span>[2219](#fn_2218) The law says: “Thou shalt not delay
to offer thy tithes and firstfruits;” grace says: “If thou wilt be
perfect, go and sell all that thou hast and give to the poor:” <span
id="fr_2219"></span>[2220](#fn_2219) The law forbids not retaliation for
wrongs and vengeance for injuries, saying “An eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth.” Grace would have our patience proved by the injuries and
blows offered to us being redoubled, and bids us be ready to endure
twice as much damage; saying: “If a man strike thee on one cheek, offer
him the other also; and to him who will contend with thee at the law and
take away thy coat, give him thy cloak also.” <span
id="fr_2220"></span>[2221](#fn_2220) The one decrees that we should hate
our enemies, the other that we should love them so that it holds that
even for them we ought always to pray to God.
