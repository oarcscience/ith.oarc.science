#### <span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XII.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p1"></span>How the upright man ought to be like
a stamp not of wax but of hard steel.

<span id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.vii.xii-p2.1"></span>And</span> so the mind of the upright man
ought not to be like wax or any other soft material which always yields
to the shape of what presses on it, and is stamped with its form and
impress and keeps it until it takes another shape by having another seal
stamped upon it; and so it results that it never retains its own form
but is turned and twisted about to correspond to whatever is pressed
upon it. But he should rather be like some stamp of hard steel, that the
mind may always keep its proper form and shape inviolate, and may stamp
and imprint on everything which occurs to it the marks of its own
condition, while upon it itself nothing that happens can leave any mark.

in one and the same condition.](2110704)
