<span id="iv.v.iv.vii"></span>

#### <span id="iv.v.iv.vii-p0.1"></span>Chapter VII.

<span id="iv.v.iv.vii-p1"></span>Of the main purpose of God and His
daily Providence.

<span id="iv.v.iv.vii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.v.iv.vii-p2.1"></span>For</span> the purpose of God whereby He
made man not to perish but to live for ever, stands immovable. And when
His goodness sees in us even the very smallest spark of good will
shining forth, which He Himself has struck as it were out of the hard
flints of our hearts, He fans and fosters it and nurses it with His
breath, as He “willeth all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge
of the truth,” for as He says, “it is not the will of your Father which
is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish,” and again it
says: “Neither will God have a soul to perish, but recalleth,” meaning
that he that is cast off should not altogether perish. <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754) For He is true, and lieth not when
He lays down with an oath: “As I live, saith the Lord God, for I will
not the death of a sinner, but that he should turn from his way and
live.” <span id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755) For if He willeth not
that one of His little ones should perish, how can we imagine without
grievous blasphemy that He does not generally will *all* men, but only
*some* instead of *all* to be saved? Those then who perish, perish
against His will, as He testifies against each one of them day by day:
“Turn from your evil ways, and why will ye die, O house of
Israel?” <span id="fr_1756"></span>[1757](#fn_1756) And again: “How
often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen gathereth her
chickens under her wings, and ye would not;” and: “Wherefore is this
people in Jerusalem turned away with a stubborn revolting? They have
hardened their faces and refused to return.” <span
id="fr_1757"></span>[1758](#fn_1757) The grace of Christ then is at hand
every day, which, while it “willeth all men to be saved and to come to
the knowledge of the truth,” calleth all without any exception, saying:
“Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
refresh you.” <span id="fr_1758"></span>[1759](#fn_1758) But if He calls
not all generally but only some, it follows that not all are heavy laden
either with original or actual sin, and that this saying is not a true
one: “For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God;” nor can
we believe that “death passed on all men.” <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[1760](#fn_1759) And so far do all who perish,
perish against the will of God, that God cannot be said to have made
death, as Scripture itself testifies: “For God made not death, neither
rejoiceth in the destruction of the living.” <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[1761](#fn_1760) And hence it comes that for the
most part when instead of good things we ask for the opposite, our
prayer is either heard but tardily or not at all; and again the Lord
vouchsafes to bring upon us even against our will, like some most
beneficent physician, for our good what we think is opposed to it, and
sometimes He delays and hinders our injurious purposes and deadly
attempts from having their <span id="page_426">p. 426</span> <span
id="iv.v.iv.vii-Page_426"></span>horrible effects, and, while we are
rushing headlong towards death, draws us back to salvation, and rescues
us without our knowing it from the jaws of hell.
