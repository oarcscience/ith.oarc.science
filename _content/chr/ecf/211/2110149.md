#### <span id="ii.vi.i.xv-p0.1"></span>Chapter XV.

<span id="ii.vi.i.xv-p1"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="ii.vi.i.xv-p1.1"></span>But</span> on the day <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274) before the people went out of Egypt,
being as yet unacquainted with dates, they were instructed by the
command of God to acknowledge that month which was then passing by as
the first of all months; and were told that the sacrifice of the day was
to be solemnly and regularly offered in coming ages, so that, on the
fourteenth day of the month, a lamb without blemish, one year old,
should be slain as a victim, and that the door-posts should be sprinkled
with its blood; that its flesh was wholly to be eaten, but not a bone of
it was to be broken; that they should abstain from what was leavened for
seven days, using only unleavened bread; and that they should hand down
the observance to their posterity. Thus the people went forth rich, both
by their own wealth, and still more by the spoils of Egypt. Their number
had grown from those seventy-five <span
id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275) Hebrews, who had first gone down into
Egypt, to six hundred thousand men. Now, there had elapsed from the time
when Abraham first reached the land of the Canaanites a period of four
hundred and thirty years, but from the deluge a period of five hundred
and seventy-five <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276) years. Well, as
they went forth in haste, a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire
by night, marched before them. But since, owing to the fact that the
gulf of the Red Sea lay between, the way led by <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277) the land of the Philistines, in order
that an opportunity might not afterwards be offered to the Hebrews,
shrinking from the desert, of returning into Egypt by a well-known road
through a continuous land-journey, by the command of God they turned
aside, and journeyed towards the Red Sea, where they stopped and pitched
their camp. When it was announced to the king that the Hebrew people,
through mistaking the road, had come to have the sea right before them,
and that they had no means of escape since the deep would prevent them,
vexed and furious that so many thousand men should escape from his
kingdom and power, he hastily led forth his army. And already the arms,
and standards, and the lines drawn up in the widespreading plains were
visible, when, as the Hebrews were in a state of terror, and gazing up
to heaven, Moses being so instructed by God, struck the sea with his
rod, and divided it. Thus a road was opened to the people as on firm
land, the waters giving way on both sides. Nor did the king of Egypt
hesitate to follow the Israelites going forward, for he entered the sea
where it had opened; and, as the waters speedily came together again,
he, with all his host, was destroyed.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[77:275](2110149.htm#fr_274) <span
id="ii.vi.i.xv-p1.2"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.xv-p2"></span> Such is Halm’s reading; another is
simply “before.”

<span id="fn_275"></span>[77:276](2110149.htm#fr_275) <span
id="ii.vi.i.xv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.xv-p3"></span> The Hebrew text has “seventy,” but our
author, as usual, follows the LXX.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[77:277](2110149.htm#fr_276) <span
id="ii.vi.i.xv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.xv-p4"></span> Again after the LXX.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[77:278](2110149.htm#fr_277) <span
id="ii.vi.i.xv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vi.i.xv-p5"></span> The text here is uncertain and obscure.
