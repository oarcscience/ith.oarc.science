#### <span id="iv.iv.viii.xiii-p0.1"></span>Chapter XIII.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xiii-p1"></span>How spirit cannot be penetrated by
spirit, and how God alone is incorporeal.

<span id="iv.iv.viii.xiii-p2"></span><span class="sc"><span
id="iv.iv.viii.xiii-p2.1"></span>For</span> even if spirit is mingled
with this crass and solid matter; viz., flesh (as very easily happens),
should we therefore believe that it can be united to the soul, which is
in like manner spirit, in such a way as to make it also receptive in the
same way of its own nature: a thing which is possible to the <span
id="page_367">p. 367</span> <span
id="iv.iv.viii.xiii-Page_367"></span>Trinity alone, which is so capable
of pervading every intellectual nature, that it cannot only embrace and
surround it but even insert itself into it and, incorporeal though it
is, be infused into a body? For though we maintain that some spiritual
natures exist, such as angels, archangels and the other powers, and
indeed our own souls and the thin air, yet we ought certainly not to
consider them incorporeal. For they have in their own fashion a body in
which they exist, though it is much finer than our bodies are, in
accordance with the Apostle’s words when he says: “And there are bodies
celestial, and bodies terrestrial:” and again: “It is sown a natural
body, it is raised a spiritual body;” <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470) from which it is clearly gathered
that there is nothing incorporeal but God alone, and therefore it is
only by Him that all spiritual and intellectual substances can be
pervaded, because He alone is whole and everywhere and in all things, in
such a way as to behold and see the thoughts of men and their inner
movements and all the recesses of the soul; since it was of Him alone
that the blessed Apostle spoke when he said: “For the word of God is
quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing
even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow;
and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; and there
is no creature invisible in His sight, but all things are naked and open
to His eyes.” <span id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471) And the blessed
David says: “Who fashioneth their hearts one by one;” and again: “For He
knoweth the secrets of the heart;” <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472) and Job too: “Thou who alone
knowest the hearts of men.” <span id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473)
