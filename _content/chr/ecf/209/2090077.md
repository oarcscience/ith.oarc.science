<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Concerning
Events* <span id="fr_1877"></span>[1878](#fn_1877) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxvi-p3"></span>Of events <span
id="fr_1878"></span>[1879](#fn_1878) , some are in our hands, others are
not. Those then are in our hands which we are free to do or not to do at
our will, that is all actions that are done voluntarily (for those
actions are not called voluntary the doing of which is not in our
hands), and in a word, all that are followed by blame or praise and
depend on motive and law. Strictly all mental <span
id="fr_1879"></span>[1880](#fn_1879) and deliberative acts are in our
hands. Now deliberation is concerned with equal possibilities: and an
‘equal possibility’ is an action that is itself within our power and its
opposite, and our mind makes choice of the alternatives, and this is the
origin of action. The actions, therefore, that are in our hands are
these equal possibilities: e.g. to be moved or not to be moved, to
hasten or not to hasten, to long for unnecessaries or not to do so, to
tell lies or not to tell lies, to give or not to give, to rejoice or not
to rejoice as fits the occasion, and all such actions as imply virtue or
vice in their performance, for we are free to do or not to do these at
our pleasure. Amongst equal possibilities also are included the arts,
for we have it in our power to cultivate these or not as we please.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxvi-p6"></span>Note, however, that while the choice
of what is to be done is ever in our power, the action itself often is
prevented by some dispensation of the divine Providence <span
id="fr_1880"></span>[1881](#fn_1880) .
