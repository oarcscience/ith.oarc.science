<span id="iii.iv.i.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*Concerning the Word and
the Son of God: a reasoned proof.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.vi-p2"></span>So then this one and only God is not
Wordless <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1464](#fn_1463) . And possessing the
Word, He will have it not as without a subsistence, nor as having had a
beginning, nor as destined to cease to be. For there never was a time
when God was not Word: but He ever possesses His own Word, begotten of
Himself, not, as our word is, without a subsistence and dissolving into
air, but having a subsistence in Him and <span id="page_5b">p. 5b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.i.vi-Page_5b"></span>life and perfection, not
proceeding out of Himself but ever existing within Himself <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1465](#fn_1464) . For where could it be, if it were
to go outside Him? For inasmuch as our nature is perishable and easily
dissolved, our word is also without subsistence. But since God is
everlasting and perfect, He will have His Word subsistent in Him, and
everlasting and living, and possessed of all the attributes of the
Begetter. For just as our word, proceeding as it does out of the mind,
is neither wholly identical with the mind nor utterly diverse from it
(for so far as it proceeds out of the mind it is different from it,
while so far as it reveals the mind, it is no longer absolutely diverse
from the mind, but being one in nature with the mind, it is yet to the
subject diverse from it), so in the same manner also the Word of
God <span id="fr_1465"></span>[1466](#fn_1465) in its independent
subsistence is differentiated <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1467](#fn_1466)
from Him from Whom it derives its subsistence <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[1468](#fn_1467) : but inasmuch as it displays in
itself the same attributes as are seen in God, it is of the same nature
as God. For just as absolute perfection is contemplated in the Father,
so also is it contemplated in the Word that is begotten of Him.

<span id="iii.iv.i.vi-p6"></span> <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vi-p6.1"></span>διῄρηται</span>, i.e. distinguished from
the Father. Objection is taken to the use of such a verb as suggestive
of division. It is often employed, however, by Greg. Naz. (e.g. *Orat*.
34) to express the distinction of persons. In many passages of Gregory
and other Fathers the noun <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vi-p6.2"></span>διαίρεσις</span> is used to express the
distinction of persons. In many passages of Gregory and other Fathers
the noun <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vi-p6.3"></span>διαίρεσις</span> is used to express the
distinction of one thing from another: and in this sense it is opposed
both to the Sabellian confusion and the Arian division.
