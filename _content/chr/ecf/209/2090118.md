<span id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI</span>.—*Concerning the
question, when Christ was called.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p2"></span>The mind was not united with God the
Word, as some falsely assert <span id="fr_2267"></span>[2268](#fn_2267)
, before the Incarnation by the Virgin and from that time called Christ.
That is the absurd nonsense of Origen <span
id="fr_2268"></span>[2269](#fn_2268) who lays down the doctrine of the
priority of the existence of souls. But we hold that the Son and Word of
God became Christ after He had dwelt in the womb of His holy ever-virgin
Mother, and became flesh without change, and that the flesh was anointed
with divinity. For this is the anointing of humanity, as Gregory the
Theologian says <span id="fr_2269"></span>[2270](#fn_2269) . And here
are the words of the most holy Cyril of Alexandria which he wrote to the
Emperor Theodosius <span id="fr_2270"></span>[2271](#fn_2270) : “For I
indeed hold that one ought to give the name Jesus Christ neither to the
Word that is of God if He is without humanity, nor yet to the temple
born of woman if it is not united with the Word. For the Word that is of
God is understood to be Christ when united with humanity in ineffable
manner in the union of the œconomy <span
id="fr_2271"></span>[2272](#fn_2271) .” And again, he writes to the
Empresses thus <span id="fr_2272"></span>[2273](#fn_2272) : “Some hold
that the name ‘Christ’ is rightly given to the Word that is begotten of
God the Father, to Him alone, and regarded separately by Himself. But we
have not been taught so to think and speak. For when the Word became
flesh, then it was, we say, that He was called Christ Jesus. For since
He was anointed with the oil of gladness, that is the Spirit, by Him Who
is God and Father, He is for this reason <span
id="fr_2273"></span>[2274](#fn_2273) called Christ. But that the
anointing was an act that concerned Him as man could be doubted by no
one who is accustomed to think rightly.” Moreover, the celebrated
Athanasius says this in his discourse “Concerning the Saving
Manifestation:” “The God Who was before the sojourn in the flesh was not
man, but God in God, being invisible and without passion, but when He
became man, He received in addition the name of Christ because of the
flesh, since, indeed, passion and death follow in the train of this
name.”

<span id="iii.iv.iv.vi-p10"></span>And although the holy Scripture <span
id="fr_2274"></span>[2275](#fn_2274) says, *Therefore God, thy God, hath
anointed thee with the oil of gladness* <span
id="fr_2275"></span>[2276](#fn_2275) , it is to be observed that the
holy Scripture often uses the past tense instead of the future, as for
example here: *Thereafter He was seen upon the earth and dwelt among
men* <span id="fr_2276"></span>[2277](#fn_2276) . For as yet God was not
seen nor did He dwell among men when this was said. And here again: *By
the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down; yea wept* <span
id="fr_2277"></span>[2278](#fn_2277) . For as yet these things had not
come to pass.
