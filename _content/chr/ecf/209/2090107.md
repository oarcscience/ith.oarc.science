<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xxv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXV</span>.—*Concerning the
Appropriation.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xxv-p2"></span>It is to be observed <span
id="fr_2228"></span>[2229](#fn_2228) that there are two
appropriations <span id="fr_2229"></span>[2230](#fn_2229) : one that is
natural and essential, and one that is personal and relative. The
natural and essential one is that by which our Lord in His love for man
took on Himself our nature and all our natural attributes, becoming in
nature and truth man, and making trial of that which is natural: but the
personal and relative appropriation is when any one assumes the person
of another relatively, for instance, out of pity or love, and in his
place utters words concerning him that have no connection with himself.
And it was in this way that our Lord appropriated both our curse and our
desertion, and such other things as are not natural: not that He Himself
was or became such, but that He took upon Himself our personality and
ranked Himself as one of us. Such is the meaning in which this phrase is
to be taken: *Being made a curse for our sakes* <span
id="fr_2230"></span>[2231](#fn_2230) .
