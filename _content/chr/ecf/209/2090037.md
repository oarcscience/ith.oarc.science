Faith.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.i.i-p2"></span> ————————————

<span id="iii.iv.i.i-p3"></span><span class="c16"><span
id="iii.iv.i.i-p3.1"></span>Book I.</span>

<span id="iii.iv.i.i-p4"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.i-p4.1"></span>Chapter I</span>.—*That the Deity is
incomprehensible, and that we ought not to pry into and meddle with the
things which have not been delivered to us by the holy Prophets, and
Apostles, and Evangelists.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.i-p5"></span>*No one hath seen God at any time; the
Only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared
Him* <span id="fr_1405"></span>[1406](#fn_1405) . The Deity, therefore,
is ineffable and incomprehensible. *For no one knoweth the Father, save
the Son, nor the Son, save the Father* <span
id="fr_1406"></span>[1407](#fn_1406) . And the Holy Spirit, too, so
knows the things of God as the spirit of the man knows the things that
are in him <span id="fr_1407"></span>[1408](#fn_1407) . Moreover, after
the first and blessed nature no one, not of men only, but even of
supramundane powers, and the Cherubim, I say, and Seraphim themselves,
has ever known God, save he to whom He revealed Himself.

<span id="iii.iv.i.i-p9"></span>God, however, did not leave us in
absolute ignorance. For the knowledge of God’s existence has been
implanted by Him in all by nature. This creation, too, and its
maintenance, and its government, proclaim the majesty of the Divine
nature <span id="fr_1408"></span>[1409](#fn_1408) . Moreover, by the Law
and the Prophets <span id="fr_1409"></span>[1410](#fn_1409) in former
times and afterwards by His Only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and
Saviour Jesus Christ, He disclosed to us the knowledge of Himself as
that was possible for us. All things, therefore, that have been
delivered to us by Law and Prophets and Apostles and Evangelists we
receive, and know, and honour <span id="fr_1410"></span>[1411](#fn_1410)
, seeking for nothing beyond these. For God, being good, is the cause of
all good, subject neither to envy nor to any passion <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[1412](#fn_1411) . For envy is far removed from the
Divine nature, which is both passionless and only good. As knowing all
things, therefore, and providing for what is profitable for each, He
revealed that which it was to our profit to know; but what we were
unable <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1413](#fn_1412) to bear He kept
secret. With these things let us be satisfied, and let us abide by them,
not removing everlasting boundaries, nor overpassing the divine
tradition <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1414](#fn_1413) .
