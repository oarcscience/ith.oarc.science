<span id="iii.iv.iii.xvii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Concerning the
deification of the nature of our Lord’s flesh and of His will.*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xvii-p2"></span>It is worthy of note <span
id="fr_2175"></span>[2176](#fn_2175) that the flesh of the Lord is not
said to have been deified and made equal to God and God in respect of
any change or alteration, or transformation, or confusion of nature: as
Gregory the Theologian <span id="fr_2176"></span>[2177](#fn_2176) says,
“Whereof the one deified, and the other was deified, and, to speak
boldly, made equal to God: and that which anointed became man, and that
which was anointed became God <span id="fr_2177"></span>[2178](#fn_2177)
.” For these words do not mean any change in nature, but rather the
œconomical union (I mean the union in subsistence by virtue of which it
was united inseparably with God the Word), and the permeation of the
natures through one another, just as we saw that burning permeated the
steel. For, just as we confess that God became man without change or
alteration, so we consider that the flesh became God without change. For
because the Word became flesh, He did not overstep the limits of His own
divinity nor abandon <span id="page_66b">p. 66b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xvii-Page_66b"></span>the divine glories that belong to
Him: nor, on the other hand, was the flesh, when deified, changed in its
own nature or in its natural properties. For even after the union, both
the natures abode unconfused and their properties unimpaired. But the
flesh of the Lord received the riches of the divine energies through the
purest union with the Word, that is to say, the union in subsistence,
without entailing the loss of any of its natural attributes. For it is
not in virtue of any energy of its own but through the Word united to
it, that it manifests divine energy: for the flaming steel burns, not
because it has been endowed in a physical way with burning energy, but
because it has obtained this energy by its union with fire <span
id="fr_2178"></span>[2179](#fn_2178) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xvii-p7"></span>Wherefore the same flesh was mortal
by reason of its own nature and life-giving through its union with the
Word in subsistence. And we hold that it is just the same with the
deification of the will <span id="fr_2179"></span>[2180](#fn_2179) ; for
its natural activity was not changed but united with His divine and
omnipotent will, and became the will of God, made man <span
id="fr_2180"></span>[2181](#fn_2180) . And so it was that, though He
wished, He could not of Himself escape <span
id="fr_2181"></span>[2182](#fn_2181) , because it pleased God the Word
that the weakness of the human will, which was in truth in Him, should
be made manifest. But He was able to cause at His will the cleansing of
the leper <span id="fr_2182"></span>[2183](#fn_2182) , because of the
union with the divine will.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xvii-p12"></span>Observe further, that the
deification of the nature and the will points most expressly and most
directly both to two natures and two wills. For just as the burning does
not change into fire the nature of the thing that is burnt, but makes
distinct both what is burnt, and what burned it, and is indicative not
of one but of two natures, so also the deification does not bring about
one compound nature but two, and their union in subsistence. Gregory the
Theologian, indeed, says, “Whereof the one deified, the other was
deified <span id="fr_2183"></span>[2184](#fn_2183) ,” and by the words
“whereof,” “the one,” “the other,” he assuredly indicates two natures.
