id="iii.iv.ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVII</span>.—*Concerning
Imagination.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xvii-p2"></span>Imagination <span
id="fr_1830"></span>[1831](#fn_1830) is a faculty of the unreasoning
part of the soul. It is through the organs of sense that it is brought
into action, and it is spoken of as sensation. And further, what is
imagined <span id="fr_1831"></span>[1832](#fn_1831) and perceived is
that which comes within the scope of the faculty of imagination and
sensation. For example, the sense of sight is the visual faculty itself,
but the object of sight is that which comes within the scope of the
sense of sight, such as a stone or any other such object. Further, an
imagination is an affection of the unreasoning part of the soul which is
occasioned by some object acting upon the sensation. But an
appearance <span id="fr_1832"></span>[1833](#fn_1832) is an empty
affection of the unreasoning part of the soul, not occasioned by any
object acting upon the sensation. Moreover the organ of imagination is
the anterior ventricle of the brain.
