<span id="iii.iv.iii.x-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter X</span>.—*Concerning the
Trisagium (“the Thrice Holy”).*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.x-p2"></span>This being so <span
id="fr_2039"></span>[2040](#fn_2039) , we declare that the addition
which the vain-minded Peter the Fuller made to the Trisagium or “Thrice
Holy” Hymn is blasphemous <span id="fr_2040"></span>[2041](#fn_2040) ;
for it introduces a fourth person into the Trinity, giving a separate
place to the Son of God, Who is the truly subsisting power of the
Father, and a separate place to Him Who was crucified as though He were
different from the “Mighty One,” or as though the Holy Trinity was
considered passible, and the Father and the Holy Spirit suffered on the
Cross along with the Son. Have done with this blasphemous <span
id="fr_2041"></span>[2042](#fn_2041) and nonsensical interpolation! For
we hold the words “Holy God” to refer to the Father, without limiting
the title of divinity to Him alone, but acknowledging also as God the
Son and the Holy Spirit: and the words <span id="page_54b">p. 54b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.iii.x-Page_54b"></span> “Holy and Mighty” we ascribe to
the Son, without stripping the Father and the Holy Spirit of might: and
the words “Holy and Immortal” we attribute to the Holy Spirit, without
depriving the Father and the Son of immortality. For, indeed, we apply
all the divine names simply and unconditionally to each of the
subsistences in imitation of the divine Apostle’s words. *But to us
there is but one God, the Father, of Whom are all things, and we in Him:
and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things, and we by Him* <span
id="fr_2042"></span>[2043](#fn_2042)  <span
id="fr_2043"></span>[2044](#fn_2043) . And, nevertheless, we follow
Gregory the Theologian <span id="fr_2044"></span>[2045](#fn_2044) when
he says, “But to us there is but one God, the Father, of Whom are all
things, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom are all things, and one
Holy Spirit, in Whom are all things:” for the words “of Whom” and
“through Whom” and “in Whom” do not divide the natures (for neither the
prepositions nor the order of the names could ever be changed), but they
characterise the properties of one unconfused nature. And this becomes
clear from the fact that they are once more gathered into one, if only
one reads with care these words of the same Apostle, *Of Him and through
Him and in Him are all things: to Him be the glory for ever and ever.
Amen* <span id="fr_2045"></span>[2046](#fn_2045) .

<span id="iii.iv.iii.x-p10"></span>For that the “Trisagium” refers not
to the Son alone <span id="fr_2046"></span>[2047](#fn_2046) , but to the
Holy Trinity, the divine and saintly Athanasius and Basil and Gregory,
and all the band of the divinely-inspired Fathers bear witness: because,
as a matter of fact, by the threefold holiness the Holy Seraphim suggest
to us the three subsistences of the superessential Godhead. But by the
one Lordship they denote the one essence and dominion of the
supremely-divine Trinity. Gregory the Theologian of a truth says <span
id="fr_2047"></span>[2048](#fn_2047) , “Thus, then, the Holy of Holies,
which is completely veiled by the Seraphim, and is glorified with three
consecrations, meet together in one lordship and one divinity.” This was
the most beautiful and sublime philosophy of still another of our
predecessors.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.x-p13"></span>Ecclesiastical historians <span
id="fr_2048"></span>[2049](#fn_2048) , then, say that once when the
people of Constantinople were offering prayers to God to avert a
threatened calamity <span id="fr_2049"></span>[2050](#fn_2049) , during
Proclus’ tenure of the office of Archbishop, it happened that a boy was
snatched up from among the people, and was taught by angelic teachers
the “Thrice Holy” Hymn, “Thou Holy God, Holy and Mighty One, Holy and
Immortal One, have mercy upon us:” and when once more he was restored to
earth, he told what he had learned, and all the people sang the Hymn,
and so the threatened calamity was averted. And in the fourth holy and
great Œcumenical Council, I mean the one at Chalcedon, we are told that
it was in this form that the Hymn was sung; for the minutes of this holy
assembly so record it <span id="fr_2050"></span>[2051](#fn_2050) . It
is, therefore, a matter for laughter and ridicule that this “Thrice
Holy” Hymn, taught us by the angels, and confirmed by the averting of
calamity <span id="fr_2051"></span>[2052](#fn_2051) , ratified and
established by so great an assembly of the holy Fathers, and sung first
by the Seraphim as a declaration of the three subsistences of the
Godhead, should be mangled and forsooth emended to suit the view of the
stupid Fuller as though he were higher than the Seraphim. But oh! the
arrogance! not to say folly! But we say it thus, though demons should
rend us in pieces, “Do Thou, Holy God, Holy and Mighty One, Holy and
Immortal One, have mercy upon us.”
