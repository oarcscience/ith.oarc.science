<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVI</span>.—*Concerning the
Antichrist* <span id="fr_2704"></span>[2705](#fn_2704) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvi-p3"></span>It should be known that the
Antichrist is bound to come. Every one, therefore, who confesses not
that the Son of God came in the flesh and is perfect God and became
perfect man, after being God, is Antichrist <span
id="fr_2705"></span>[2706](#fn_2705) . But in a peculiar and special
sense he who comes at the consummation of the age is called
Antichrist <span id="fr_2706"></span>[2707](#fn_2706) . First, then, it
is requisite that the Gospel should be preached among all nations, as
the Lord said <span id="fr_2707"></span>[2708](#fn_2707) , and then he
will come to refute the impious Jews. For the Lord said to them: *I am
come in My Father’s name and ye receive Me not: if another shall come in
his own name, him ye will receive* <span
id="fr_2708"></span>[2709](#fn_2708) . And the apostle says, *Because
they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved, for
this cause God shall send them a strong delusion that they should
believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth,
but had pleasure in unrighteousness* <span
id="fr_2709"></span>[2710](#fn_2709) . The Jews accordingly did not
receive the Lord Jesus Christ who was the Son of God and God, but
receive the impostor who calls himself God <span
id="fr_2710"></span>[2711](#fn_2710) . For that he will assume the name
of God, the angel teaches Daniel, saying these words, *Neither shall he
regard the God of his fathers* <span
id="fr_2711"></span>[2712](#fn_2711) . And the apostle says: *Let no man
deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come except there come
a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of
perdition: who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
God or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of
God* <span id="fr_2712"></span>[2713](#fn_2712) *, shewing himself that
he is God;* in the temple of God he said; not our temple, but the old
Jewish temple <span id="fr_2713"></span>[2714](#fn_2713) . For he will
come not to us but to the Jews: not for Christ or the things of Christ:
wherefore he is called Antichrist <span
id="fr_2714"></span>[2715](#fn_2714) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvi-p14"></span>First, therefore, it is necessary
that the Gospel should be preached among all nations <span
id="fr_2715"></span>[2716](#fn_2715) : *And then shall that wicked one
be* <span id="page_99b">p. 99b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxvi-Page_99b"></span>*revealed, even him whose coming is
after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying
wonders* <span id="fr_2716"></span>[2717](#fn_2716) *, with all
deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish, whom the Lord
shall consume with the word of His mouth and shall destroy with the
brightness of His coming* <span id="fr_2717"></span>[2718](#fn_2717) .
The devil himself <span id="fr_2718"></span>[2719](#fn_2718) , therefore
does not become man in the way that the Lord was made man. God forbid!
but he becomes man as the offspring of fornication and receiveth all the
energy of Satan. For God, foreknowing the strangeness of the choice that
he would make, allows the devil to take up his abode in him <span
id="fr_2719"></span>[2720](#fn_2719) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvi-p20"></span>He is, therefore, as we said, the
offspring of fornication and is nurtured in secret, and on a sudden he
rises up and rebels and assumes rule. And in the beginning of his rule,
or rather tyranny, he assumes the role of sanctity <span
id="fr_2720"></span>[2721](#fn_2720) . But when he becomes master he
persecutes the Church of God and displays all his wickedness. But he
will come *with signs and lying wonders* <span
id="fr_2721"></span>[2722](#fn_2721) , fictitious and not real, and he
will deceive and lead away from the living God those whose mind rests on
an unsound and unstable foundation, so that even the elect shall, if it
be possible, be made to stumble <span
id="fr_2722"></span>[2723](#fn_2722) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxvi-p24"></span>But Enoch and Elias the Thesbite
shall be sent and shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children <span id="fr_2723"></span>[2724](#fn_2723) , that is, the
synagogue to our Lord Jesus Christ and the preaching of the apostles:
and they will be destroyed by him. And the Lord shall come out of
heaven, just as the holy apostles beheld Him going into heaven, perfect
God and perfect man, with glory and power, and will destroy the man of
lawlessness, the son of destruction, with the breath of His mouth <span
id="fr_2724"></span>[2725](#fn_2724) . Let no one, therefore, look for
the Lord to come from earth, but out of Heaven, as He himself has made
sure <span id="fr_2725"></span>[2726](#fn_2725) .
