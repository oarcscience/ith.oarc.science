<span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*Concerning the Holy
Spirit, a reasoned proof.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p2"></span>Moreover the Word must also possess
Spirit <span id="fr_1468"></span>[1469](#fn_1468) . For in fact even our
word is not destitute of spirit; but in our case the spirit is something
different from our essence <span id="fr_1469"></span>[1470](#fn_1469) .
For there is an attraction and movement of the air which is drawn in and
poured forth that the body may be sustained. And it is this which in the
moment of utterance becomes the articulate word, revealing in itself the
force of the word <span id="fr_1470"></span>[1471](#fn_1470) . <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[1472](#fn_1471) But in the case of the divine
nature, which is simple and uncompound, we must confess in all piety
that there exists a Spirit of God, for the Word is not more imperfect
than our own word. Now we cannot, in piety, consider the Spirit to be
something foreign that gains admission into God from without, as is the
case with compound natures like us. Nay, just as, when we heard <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[1473](#fn_1472) of the Word of God, we considered
it to be not without subsistence, nor the product of learning, nor the
mere utterance of voice, nor as passing into the air and perishing, but
as being essentially subsisting, endowed with free volition, and energy,
and omnipotence: so also, when we have learnt about the Spirit of God,
we contemplate it as the companion of the Word and the revealer of His
energy, and not as mere breath without subsistence. For to conceive of
the Spirit that dwells in God as after the likeness of our own spirit,
would be to drag down the greatness of the divine nature to the lowest
depths of degradation. But we must contemplate it as an essential power,
existing in its own proper and peculiar subsistence, proceeding from the
Father and resting in the Word <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[1474](#fn_1473) , and shewing forth the Word,
neither capable of disjunction from God in Whom it exists, and the Word
Whose companion it is, nor poured forth to vanish into nothingness <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[1475](#fn_1474) , but being in subsistence in the
likeness of the Word, endowed with life, free volition, independent
movement, energy, ever willing that which is good, and having power to
keep pace with the will in all its decrees <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[1476](#fn_1475) , having no beginning and no end.
For never was the Father at any time lacking in the Word, nor the Word
in the Spirit.

<span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p11"></span>Thus because of the unity in nature,
the error of the Greeks in holding that God is many, is utterly
destroyed: and again by our acceptance of the Word and the Spirit, the
dogma of the Jews is overthrown: and there remains of each party <span
id="fr_1476"></span>[1477](#fn_1476) only what is profitable <span
id="fr_1477"></span>[1478](#fn_1477) . On the one hand of the Jewish
idea we have the unity of God’s nature, and on the other, of the Greek,
we have the distinction in subsistences and that only <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[1479](#fn_1478) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p15"></span><span id="page_6b">p. 6b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-Page_6b"></span>But should the Jew refuse to accept the
Word and the Spirit, let the divine Scripture confute him and curb his
tongue. For concerning the Word, the divine David says, *For ever, O
Lord, Thy Word is settled in heaven* <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[1480](#fn_1479) . And again, *He sent His Word and
healed them* <span id="fr_1480"></span>[1481](#fn_1480) . But the word
that is uttered is not sent, nor is it for ever settled <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[1482](#fn_1481) . And concerning the Spirit, the
same David says, *Thou sendest forth Thy Spirit, they are created* <span
id="fr_1482"></span>[1483](#fn_1482) . And again, *By the word of the
Lord were the heavens made: and all the host of them by the breath of
His mouth* <span id="fr_1483"></span>[1484](#fn_1483) . Job, too, says,
*The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath
given me life* <span id="fr_1484"></span>[1485](#fn_1484) . Now the
Spirit which is sent and makes and stablishes and conserves, is not mere
breath that dissolves, any more than the mouth of God is a bodily
member. For the conception of both must be such as harmonizes with the
Divine nature <span id="fr_1485"></span>[1486](#fn_1485) .

<span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p3"></span> The Greek theologians, founding on
the primary sense of the Greek term <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p3.1"></span>Πνεῦμα</span>, and on certain passages of
Scripture in which the word seemed to retain that sense more or less
(especially [Psalm xxxiii. 6](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006)<span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p3.2"></span>. in the Vulgate rendering, verbo Dei cœli
formati sunt: et spiritu oris ejus omnis virtus eorum), spoke of the
Holy Ghost as proceeding from the Father like the breath of His mouth in
the utterance or emission of His Word. See ch. 15 of this Book, where we
have the sentence, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p3.3"></span>οὐδεμία γὰρ ὁρμὴ ἄνευ πνεύματος</span>.
Compare also such passages as these—*Greg. Naz., Orat*. i. 3: *Cyril.
Alex., Thes., assert*. 34, *De Trin. dial*. 2, p. 425, and 7, pp. 634,
640; *Basil, Contra Eunom*., B.V., and *De Spiritu Sancto*, ch. 18;
*Greg. Scholar., Contra Latin., de process*. *Spiritus Sancti*, i. 4,
where we have the statement <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p3.4"></span>οὕτω καὶ τὸ ἅγιον Πνεῦμα ὥσπερ ὁρμὴ καὶ
κίνησις, ἐνδοτέρα τῆς ὑπερφυοῦς ἐκείνης οὐσίας</span>, *so the Holy
Spirit is like an impulse and movement within that supernatural
essence*.

<span id="fn_1469"></span>[5b:1470](2090043.htm#fr_1469) <span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p3.5"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p4"></span> Or, *substance*; <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p4.1"></span>οὐσία</span>.

<span id="fn_1470"></span>[5b:1471](2090043.htm#fr_1470) <span

<span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p5"></span> Text, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p5.1"></span>φανεροῦσα</span>: various reading, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p5.2"></span>φέρουσα</span> (cf.
*Cyril, De Trinitate*).

<span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p6"></span> *Greg. Nyss., Catech*., c. 2.

<span id="fn_1472"></span>[5b:1473](2090043.htm#fr_1472) <span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p7"></span> Text, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p7.1"></span>ἀκούσαντες</span>: variant, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p7.2"></span>ἀκούοντες</span> (so
in *Cyril*).

<span id="fn_1473"></span>[5b:1474](2090043.htm#fr_1473) <span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p7.3"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p8"></span> So Cyril speaks frequently of the
Holy Spirit as *proceeding from the Father* and *being* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p8.1"></span>ειναι</span>) and
*abiding* (<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p8.2"></span>μένειν</span>) *in the Son*; as also of
the Spirit as *being of the Son and having His nature in Him* (<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p8.3"></span>ἐξ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐμπεφυκὼς
αὐτῷ</span>). The idea seems to have been that as the Son is in the
bosom of the Father so the Spirit is in the bosom of the Son. The Spirit
was compared again to the *energy*, the *natural, living energy, of the
Son* (<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p8.4"></span>ἐνέργεια
φυσικὴ καὶ ζωσα, τὸ ἐνεργὲς τοῦ υἱοῦ</span>), *Cyril, Dial* 7 *ad
Hermiam*. Such terms as <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.i.vii-p8.5"></span>προβολεὺς ἐκφαντορικοῦ πνεύματος</span>,
the *Producer*, or, *Emitter of the revealing Spirit*, and the <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p8.6"></span>ἔκφανσις</span> or
<span class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.i.vii-p8.7"></span>ἔλλαμψις</span>,
the *revealing*, the *forth-shewing*, were also used to express the
procession of the one eternal Person from the Other as like the emission
or forth-shewing of light from light.
