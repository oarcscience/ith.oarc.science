creation.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>Since, then, God, Who is good and more
than good, did not find satisfaction in self-contemplation, but in His
exceeding goodness wished certain things to come into existence which
would enjoy His benefits and share in His goodness, He brought all
things out of nothing into being and created them, both what is
invisible and what is visible. Yea, even man, who is a compound of the
visible and the invisible. And it is by thought that He creates, and
thought is the basis of the work, the Word filling it and the Spirit
perfecting it <span id="fr_1649"></span>[1650](#fn_1649) .
