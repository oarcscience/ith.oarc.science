<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiv-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xxiv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIV</span>.—*Concerning
Virginity.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiv-p2"></span>Carnal men abuse virginity <span
id="fr_2665"></span>[2666](#fn_2665) , and the pleasure-loving bring
forward the following verse in proof, *Cursed be every one that raiseth
not up seed in Israel* <span id="fr_2666"></span>[2667](#fn_2666) . But
we, made confident by God the Word that was made flesh of the Virgin,
answer that virginity was implanted in man’s nature from above and in
the beginning. For man was formed of virgin soil. From Adam alone was
Eve created. In Paradise virginity held sway. Indeed, Divine Scripture
tells that *both Adam and Eve were naked and were not ashamed* <span
id="fr_2667"></span>[2668](#fn_2667) . But after their transgression
they knew that they were naked, and in their shame they sewed aprons for
themselves <span id="fr_2668"></span>[2669](#fn_2668) . And when, after
the transgression, Adam heard, *dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou
return* <span id="fr_2669"></span>[2670](#fn_2669) , when death entered
into the world by reason of the transgression, then *Adam knew Eve his
wife, and she conceived and bare seed* <span
id="fr_2670"></span>[2671](#fn_2670) . So that to prevent the wearing
out and destruction of the race by death, marriage was devised that the
race of men may be preserved through the procreation of children <span
id="fr_2671"></span>[2672](#fn_2671) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiv-p10"></span>But they will perhaps ask, what
then is the meaning of “male and female <span
id="fr_2672"></span>[2673](#fn_2672) ,” and “Be fruitful and multiply?”
In answer we shall say that “Be fruitful and multiply <span
id="fr_2673"></span>[2674](#fn_2673) ” does not <span id="page_97b">p.
97b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiv-Page_97b"></span>altogether refer to
the multiplying by the marriage connection. For God had power to
multiply the race also in different ways, if they kept the precept
unbroken <span id="fr_2674"></span>[2675](#fn_2674) to the end <span
id="fr_2675"></span>[2676](#fn_2675) . But God, Who knoweth all things
before they have existence, knowing in His foreknowledge that they would
fall into transgression in the future and be condemned to death,
anticipated this and made “male and female,” and bade them “be fruitful
and multiply.” Let us, then, proceed on our way and see the
glories <span id="fr_2676"></span>[2677](#fn_2676) of virginity: and
this also includes chastity.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiv-p16"></span>Noah when he was commanded to enter
the ark and was entrusted with the preservation of the seed of the world
received this command, *Go in*, saith the Lord, *thou and thy sons, and
thy wife, and thy sons’ wives* <span
id="fr_2677"></span>[2678](#fn_2677) . He separated them from their
wives <span id="fr_2678"></span>[2679](#fn_2678) in order that with
purity they might escape the flood and that shipwreck of the whole
world. After the cessation of the flood, however, He said, *Go forth of
the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives* <span
id="fr_2679"></span>[2680](#fn_2679) . Lo, again, marriage is granted
for the sake of the multiplication of the race. Next, Elias, the
fire-breathing charioteer and sojourner in heaven did not embrace
celibacy, and yet was not his virtue attested by his super-human
ascension <span id="fr_2680"></span>[2681](#fn_2680) ? Who closed the
heavens? Who raised the dead <span id="fr_2681"></span>[2682](#fn_2681)
? Who divided Jordan <span id="fr_2682"></span>[2683](#fn_2682) ? Was it
not the virginal Elias? And did not Elisha, his disciple, after he had
given proof of equal virtue, ask and obtain as an inheritance a double
portion of the grace of the Spirit <span
id="fr_2683"></span>[2684](#fn_2683) ? What of the three youths? Did
they not by practising virginity become mightier than fire, their bodies
through virginity being made proof against the fire <span
id="fr_2684"></span>[2685](#fn_2684) ? And was it not Daniel’s body that
was so hardened by virginity that the wild beasts’ teeth could not
fasten in it <span id="fr_2685"></span>[2686](#fn_2685) . Did not God,
when He wished the Israelites to see Him, bid them purify the body <span
id="fr_2686"></span>[2687](#fn_2686) ? Did not the priests purify
themselves and so approach the temple’s shrine and offer victims? And
did not the law call chastity the great vow?

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiv-p27"></span>The precept of the law, therefore,
is to be taken in a more spiritual sense. For there is spiritual seed
which is conceived through the love and fear of God in the spiritual
womb, travailing and bringing forth the spirit of salvation. And in this
sense must be understood this verse: *Blessed is he who hath seed in
Zion and posterity in Jerusalem.* For does it mean that, although he be
a whoremonger and a drunkard and an idolater, he is still blessed if
only he hath seed in Sion and posterity in Jerusalem? No one in his
senses will say this.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiv-p28"></span>Virginity is the rule of life among
the angels, the property of all incorporeal nature. This we say without
speaking ill of marriage: God forbid! (for we know that the Lord blessed
marriage by His presence <span id="fr_2687"></span>[2688](#fn_2687) ,
and we know him who said, *Marriage is honourable and the bed
undefiled* <span id="fr_2688"></span>[2689](#fn_2688) ), but knowing
that virginity is better than marriage, however good. For among the
virtues, equally as among the vices, there are higher and lower grades.
We know that all mortals after the first parents of the race are the
offspring of marriage. For the first parents were the work of virginity
and not of marriage. But celibacy is, as we said, an imitation of the
angels. Wherefore virginity is as much more honourable than marriage, as
the angel is higher than man. But why do I say angel? Christ Himself is
the glory of virginity, who was not only-begotten of the Father without
beginning or emission or connection, but also became man in our image,
being made flesh for our sakes of the Virgin without connection, and
manifesting in Himself the true and perfect virginity. Wherefore,
although He did not enjoin that on us by law (for as He said, *all men
cannot receive this saying* <span id="fr_2689"></span>[2690](#fn_2689)
), yet in actual fact He taught us that and gave us strength for it. For
it is surely clear to every one that virginity now is flourishing among
men.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xxiv-p32"></span>Good indeed is the procreation of
children enjoined by the law, and good is marriage <span
id="fr_2690"></span>[2691](#fn_2690) on account of fornications, for it
does away with these <span id="fr_2691"></span>[2692](#fn_2691) , and by
lawful intercourse does not permit the madness of desire to be enflamed
into unlawful acts. Good is marriage for those who have no continence:
but that virginity is better which increases the fruitfulness of the
soul and offers to God the seasonable fruit of prayer. *Marriage is
honourable and the bed undefiled, but whoremongers and adulterers God
will judge* <span id="fr_2692"></span>[2693](#fn_2692) .
