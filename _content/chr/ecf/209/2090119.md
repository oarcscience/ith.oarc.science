<span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p1.1"></span>Chapter VII</span>.—*In answer to those
who enquire whether the holy Mother of God bore two natures, and whether
two natures hung upon the Cross.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p2"></span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p2.1"></span>ἀγένητον</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p2.2"></span>γενητόν</span>,
written with one ‘<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p2.3"></span>ν</span><span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p2.4"></span>’ <span
id="fr_2278"></span>[2279](#fn_2278) </span> and meaning uncreated and
created, refer to nature: but <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.1"></span>ἀγέννητον</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.2"></span>γεννητόν</span>, that
is to say, unbegotten and begotten, as the double ‘<span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.3"></span>ν</span>’ indicates,
refer not to nature but to subsistence. The divine nature then is <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.4"></span>ἀγένητος</span>, that
is to say, uncreate, but all things that come after the divine nature
are <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.5"></span>γένητα</span>, that is, created. In the
divine and uncreated nature, therefore, the property of being <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.6"></span>ἀγέννητον</span> or
unbegotten is contemplated in the Father (for He was not begotten), that
of being <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.7"></span>γέννητον</span> or begotten in the Son
(for He has been eternally begotten of the Father), <span
id="page_77b">p. 77b</span> <span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-Page_77b"></span>and
that of procession in the Holy Spirit. Moreover of each species of
living creatures, the first members were <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.8"></span>ἀγέννητα</span> but not <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.9"></span>ἀγένητα</span>: for
they were brought into being by their Maker, but were not the offspring
of creatures like themselves. For <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.10"></span>γένεσις</span> is creation, while <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p3.11"></span>γέννησις</span> or
begetting is in the case of God the origin of a co-essential Son arising
from the Father alone, and in the case of bodies, the origin of a
co-essential subsistence arising from the contact of male and female.
And thus we perceive that begetting refers not to nature but to
subsistence <span id="fr_2279"></span>[2280](#fn_2279) . For if it did
refer to nature, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p4.1"></span>τὸ γέννητον</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p4.2"></span>το ἀγέννητον</span>,
i.e. the properties of being begotten and unbegotten, could not be
contemplated in one and the same nature. Accordingly the holy Mother of
God bore a subsistence revealed in two natures; being begotten on the
one hand, by reason of its divinity, of the Father timelessly, and, at
last, on the other hand, being incarnated of her in time and born in the
flesh.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.vii-p5"></span>But if our interrogators should hint
that He Who is begotten of the holy Mother of God is two natures, we
reply, “Yea! He is two natures: for He is in His own person God and man.
And the same is to be said concerning the crucifixion and resurrection
and ascension. For these refer not to nature but to subsistence. Christ
then, since He is in two natures, suffered and was crucified in the
nature that was subject to passion. For it was in the flesh and not in
His divinity that He hung upon the Cross. Otherwise, let them answer us,
when we ask if two natures died. No, we shall say. And so two natures
were not crucified but Christ was begotten, that is to say, the divine
Word having become man was begotten in the flesh, was crucified in the
flesh, suffered in the flesh, while His divinity continued to be
impassible.”
