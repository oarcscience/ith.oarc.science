<span id="iii.iv.iii.xi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XI</span>.—*Concerning the Nature
as viewed in Species and in Individual, and concerning the difference
between Union and Incarnation: and how this is to be understood, “The
one Nature of God the Word Incarnate.”*

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xi-p2"></span>Nature <span
id="fr_2052"></span>[2053](#fn_2052) is regarded either abstractly as a
matter of pure thought <span id="fr_2053"></span>[2054](#fn_2053) (for
it has no independent existence): or commonly in all subsistences of the
same species as their bond of union, and is then spoken of as nature
viewed in species: or universally as the same, but with the addition of
accidents, in one subsistence, and is spoken of as nature viewed in the
individual, this being identical with nature viewed in species <span
id="fr_2054"></span>[2055](#fn_2054) . God the Word Incarnate,
therefore, did not assume the nature that is regarded as an abstraction
in pure thought (for this is not incarnation, but only an imposture and
a figment of incarnation), nor the nature viewed in species (for He did
not <span id="page_55b">p. 55b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iii.xi-Page_55b"></span>assume all the subsistences): but the
nature viewed in the individual, which is identical with that viewed in
species. For He took on Himself the elements of our compound nature, and
these not as having an independent existence or as being originally an
individual, and in this way assumed by Him, but as existing in His own
subsistence. For the subsistence of God the Word in itself became the
subsistence of the flesh, and accordingly “the Word became flesh <span
id="fr_2055"></span>[2056](#fn_2055) ” clearly without any change, and
likewise the flesh became Word without alteration, and God became man.
For the Word is God, and man is God, through having one and the same
subsistence. And so it is possible to speak of the same thing as being
the nature of the Word and the nature in the individual. For it
signifies strictly and exclusively neither the individual, that is, the
subsistence, nor the common nature of the subsistences, but the common
nature as viewed and presented in one of the subsistences.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xi-p7"></span>Union, then, is one thing, and
incarnation is something quite different. For union signifies only the
conjunction, but not at all that with which union is effected. But
incarnation (which is just the same as if one said “the putting on of
man’s nature”) signifies that the conjunction is with flesh, that is to
say, with man, just as the heating of iron <span
id="fr_2056"></span>[2057](#fn_2056) implies its union with fire.
Indeed, the blessed Cyril himself, when he is interpreting the phrase,
“one nature of God the Word Incarnate,” says in the second epistle to
Sucensus, “For if we simply said ‘the one nature of the Word’ and then
were silent, and did not add the word ‘incarnate,’ but, so to speak,
quite excluded the dispensation <span
id="fr_2057"></span>[2058](#fn_2057) , there would be some plausibility
in the question they feign to ask, ‘If one nature is the whole, what
becomes of the perfection in humanity, or how has the essence <span
id="fr_2058"></span>[2059](#fn_2058) like us come to exist?’ But
inasmuch as the perfection in humanity and the disclosure of the essence
like us are conveyed in the word ‘incarnate,’ they must cease from
relying on a mere straw.” Here, then, he placed the nature of the Word
over nature itself. For if He had received nature instead of
subsistence, it would not have been absurd to have omitted the
“incarnate.” For when we say simply one subsistence of God the Word, we
do not err <span id="fr_2059"></span>[2060](#fn_2059) . In like manner,
also, Leontius the Byzantine <span id="fr_2060"></span>[2061](#fn_2060)
considered this phrase to refer to nature, and not to subsistence. But
in the Defence which he wrote in reply to the attacks that Theodoret
made on the second anathema, the blessed Cyril <span
id="fr_2061"></span>[2062](#fn_2061) says this: “The nature of the Word,
that is, the subsistence, which is the Word itself.” So that “the nature
of the Word” means neither the subsistence alone, nor “the common nature
of the subsistence,” but “the common nature viewed as a whole in the
subsistence of the Word.”

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xi-p14"></span>It has been said, then, that the
nature of the Word became flesh, that is, was united to flesh: but that
the nature of the Word suffered in the flesh we have never heard up till
now, though we have been taught that Christ suffered in the flesh. So
that “the nature of the Word” does not mean “the subsistence.” It
remains, therefore, to say that to become flesh is to be united with the
flesh, while the Word having become flesh means that the very
subsistence of the Word became without change the subsistence of the
flesh. It has also been said that God became man, and man God. For the
Word which is God became without alteration man. But that the Godhead
became man, or became flesh, or put on the nature of man, this we have
never heard. This, indeed, we have learned, that the Godhead was united
to humanity in one of its subsistences, and it has been stated that God
took on a different form or essence <span
id="fr_2062"></span>[2063](#fn_2062) , to wit our own. For the name God
is applicable to each of the subsistences, but we cannot use the term
Godhead in reference to subsistence. For we are never told that the
Godhead is the Father alone, or the Son alone, or the Holy Spirit alone.
For “Godhead” implies “nature,” while “Father” implies subsistence, just
as “Humanity” implies nature, and “Peter” subsistence. But “God”
indicates the common element of the nature, and is applicable
derivatively to each of the subsistences, just as “man” is. For He Who
has divine nature is God, and he who has human nature is man.

<span id="iii.iv.iii.xi-p16"></span>Besides all this, notice <span
id="fr_2063"></span>[2064](#fn_2063) that the Father and the Holy Spirit
take no part at all in the incarnation of the Word except in connection
with the miracles, and in respect of good will and purpose.
