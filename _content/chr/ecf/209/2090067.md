<span id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*Concerning Anger.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p2"></span>Anger is the ebullition <span
id="fr_1827"></span>[1828](#fn_1827) of the heart’s blood <span
id="fr_1828"></span>[1829](#fn_1828) produced by bilious exhalation or
turbidity. Hence it is that the words <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p4.2"></span>χολή</span> and <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p4.3"></span>χόλος</span> <span
id="fr_1829"></span>[1830](#fn_1829) are both used in the sense of
anger. Anger is sometimes lust for vengeance. For when we are wronged or
think that we are wronged, we are distressed, and there arises this
mixture of desire and anger.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6"></span>There are three forms of anger: rage,
which the Greeks also call <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6.1"></span>χολή</span> or <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6.2"></span>χόλος</span>, <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6.3"></span>μῆνις</span> and <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6.4"></span>κότος</span>. When
anger arises and begins to be roused, it is called rage or <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6.5"></span>χολή</span> or <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6.6"></span>χόλος</span>. Wrath
again implies that the bile endures, that is to say, that the memory of
the wrong abides: and indeed the Greek word for it, <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6.7"></span>μῆνις</span> is
derived from <span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6.8"></span>μένειν</span>, and means what abides and
is transferred to memory. Rancour, on the other hand, implies watching
for a suitable moment for revenge, and the Greek word for it is <span
class="Greek"><span id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6.9"></span>κότος</span> from
<span class="Greek"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p6.10"></span>κεῖσθαι</span>.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-p7"></span>Anger further is the satellite of
reason, the vindicator of desire. For when we long after anything and
are opposed in our desire by some one, we are angered at that person, as
though we had been wronged: and reason evidently deems that there are
just grounds for displeasure in what has happened, in the <span
id="page_34b">p. 34b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.xvi-Page_34b"></span>case of those who, like us, have in
the natural course of things to guard their own position.
