<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*Concerning Faith and
Baptism.*

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p2"></span>We confess one baptism for the
remission of sins and for life eternal. For baptism declares the Lord’s
death. We are indeed “buried with the Lord through baptism <span
id="fr_2287"></span>[2288](#fn_2287) ,” as saith the divine Apostle. So
then, as our Lord died once for all, we also must be baptized once for
all, and baptized according to the Word of the Lord, *In the Name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit* <span
id="fr_2288"></span>[2289](#fn_2288) , being taught the confession in
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Those <span
id="fr_2289"></span>[2290](#fn_2289) , then, who, after having been
baptized into Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and having been taught that
there is one divine nature in three subsistences, are rebaptized, these,
as the divine Apostle says, crucify the Christ afresh. *For it is
impossible, he saith, for those who were once enlightened, &c., to renew
them again unto repentance: seeing they crucify to themselves the Christ
afresh, and put Him to an open shame* <span
id="fr_2290"></span>[2291](#fn_2290) . But those who were not bap<span
id="page_78b">p. 78b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.ix-Page_78b"></span>tized into the Holy Trinity, these
must be baptized again. For although the divine Apostle says: *Into
Christ and into His death were we baptized* <span
id="fr_2291"></span>[2292](#fn_2291) , he does not mean that the
invocation of baptism must be in these words, but that baptism is an
image of the death of Christ. For by the three immersions <span
id="fr_2292"></span>[2293](#fn_2292) , baptism signifies the three days
of our Lord’s entombment <span id="fr_2293"></span>[2294](#fn_2293) .
The baptism then into Christ means that believers are baptized into Him.
We could not believe in Christ if we were not taught confession in
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit <span id="fr_2294"></span>[2295](#fn_2294)
. For Christ is the Son of the Living God <span
id="fr_2295"></span>[2296](#fn_2295) , Whom the Father anointed with the
Holy Spirit <span id="fr_2296"></span>[2297](#fn_2296) : in the words of
the divine David, *Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the
oil of gladness above thy fellows* <span
id="fr_2297"></span>[2298](#fn_2297) . And Isaiah also speaking in the
person of the Lord says, *The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because He
hath anointed me* <span id="fr_2298"></span>[2299](#fn_2298) . Christ,
however, taught His own disciples the invocation and said, *Baptizing
them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit* <span id="fr_2299"></span>[2300](#fn_2299) . For since Christ
made us for incorruption <span id="fr_2300"></span>[2301](#fn_2300)
 <span id="fr_2301"></span>[2302](#fn_2301) , and we transgressed His
saving command, He condemned us to the corruption of death in order that
that which is evil should not be immortal, and when in His compassion He
stooped to His servants and became like us, He redeemed us from
corruption through His own passion. He caused the fountain of remission
to well forth for us out of His holy and immaculate side <span
id="fr_2302"></span>[2303](#fn_2302) , water for our regeneration, and
the washing away of sin and corruption; and blood to drink as the
hostage of life eternal. And He laid on us the command to be born again
of water and of the Spirit <span id="fr_2303"></span>[2304](#fn_2303) ,
through prayer and invocation, the Holy Spirit drawing nigh unto the
water <span id="fr_2304"></span>[2305](#fn_2304) . For since man’s
nature is twofold, consisting of soul and body, He bestowed on us a
twofold purification, of water and of the Spirit: the Spirit renewing
that part in us which is after His image and likeness, and the water by
the grace of the Spirit cleansing the body from sin and delivering it
from corruption, the water indeed expressing the image of death, but the
Spirit affording the earnest of life.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p21"></span>For from the beginning *the Spirit of
God moved upon the face of the waters* <span
id="fr_2305"></span>[2306](#fn_2305) , and anew the Scripture witnesseth
that water has the power of purification <span
id="fr_2306"></span>[2307](#fn_2306) . In the time of Noah God washed
away the sin of the world by water <span
id="fr_2307"></span>[2308](#fn_2307) . By water every impure person is
purified <span id="fr_2308"></span>[2309](#fn_2308) , according to the
law, even the very garments being washed with water. Elias shewed forth
the grace of the Spirit mingled with the water when he burned the
holocaust by pouring on water <span id="fr_2309"></span>[2310](#fn_2309)
. And almost everything is purified by water according to the law: for
the things of sight are symbols of the things of thought. The
regeneration, however, takes place in the spirit: for faith has the
power of making us sons (of God <span
id="fr_2310"></span>[2311](#fn_2310) ), creatures as we are, by the
Spirit, and of leading us into our original blessedness.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p28"></span>The remission of sins, therefore, is
granted alike to all through baptism: but the grace of the Spirit is
proportional to the faith and previous purification. Now, indeed, we
receive the firstfruits of the Holy Spirit through baptism, and the
second birth is for us the beginning and seal and security and
illumination <span id="fr_2311"></span>[2312](#fn_2311) of another life.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p30"></span>It behoves us, then, with all our
strength to steadfastly keep ourselves pure from filthy works, that we
may not, like the dog returning to his vomit <span
id="fr_2312"></span>[2313](#fn_2312) , make ourselves again the slaves
of sin. For faith apart from works is dead, and so likewise are works
apart from faith <span id="fr_2313"></span>[2314](#fn_2313) . For the
true faith is attested by works.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p33"></span>Now we are baptized <span
id="fr_2314"></span>[2315](#fn_2314) into the Holy Trinity because those
things which are baptized have need of the Holy Trinity for their
maintenance and continuance, and the three subsistences cannot be
otherwise than present, the one with the other. For the Holy Trinity is
indivisible.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p35"></span>The first baptism <span
id="fr_2315"></span>[2316](#fn_2315) was that of the flood for the
eradication of sin. The second <span
id="fr_2316"></span>[2317](#fn_2316) was through the sea and the cloud:
for the cloud is the symbol of the Spirit and the sea of the water <span
id="fr_2317"></span>[2318](#fn_2317) . The third baptism was that of the
Law: for every impure person washed himself with water, and even washed
his garments, and so entered into the camp <span
id="fr_2318"></span>[2319](#fn_2318) . The fourth <span
id="fr_2319"></span>[2320](#fn_2319) was that of John <span
id="fr_2320"></span>[2321](#fn_2320) , being preliminary and leading
those who were baptized to repentance, that they might believe in
Christ: *I,* <span id="page_79b">p. 79b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.iv.ix-Page_79b"></span>*indeed*, he said, *baptize you with
water; but He that cometh after me, He will baptize you in the Holy
Spirit and in fire*. <span id="fr_2321"></span>[2322](#fn_2321) Thus
John’s purification with water was preliminary to receiving the Spirit.
The fifth was the baptism of our Lord, whereby He Himself was baptized.
Now He is baptized not as Himself requiring purification but as making
my purification His own, that He may break the heads of the dragons on
the water, <span id="fr_2322"></span>[2323](#fn_2322) that He may wash
away sin and bury all the old Adam in water, that He may sanctify the
Baptist, that He may fulfil the Law, that He may reveal the mystery of
the Trinity, that He may become the type and ensample to us of baptism.
But we, too, are baptized in the perfect baptism of our Lord, the
baptism by water and the Spirit. Moreover, <span
id="fr_2323"></span>[2324](#fn_2323) Christ is said to baptize with
fire: because in the form of flaming tongues He poured forth on His holy
disciples the grace of the Spirit: as the Lord Himself says, *John truly
baptized with water: but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit and
with fire, not many days hence:* <span
id="fr_2324"></span>[2325](#fn_2324) or else it is because of the
baptism of future fire wherewith we are to be chastized. <span
id="fr_2325"></span>[2326](#fn_2325) The sixth is that by repentance and
tears, which baptism is truly grievous. The seventh is baptism by blood
and martyrdom, <span id="fr_2326"></span>[2327](#fn_2326) which baptism
Christ Himself underwent in our behalf, <span
id="fr_2327"></span>[2328](#fn_2327) He Who was too august and blessed
to be defiled with any later stains. <span
id="fr_2328"></span>[2329](#fn_2328) The eighth <span
id="fr_2329"></span>[2330](#fn_2329) is the last, which is not saving,
but which destroys evil: <span id="fr_2330"></span>[2331](#fn_2330) for
evil and sin no longer have sway: yet it punishes without end. <span
id="fr_2331"></span>[2332](#fn_2331)

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p53"></span>Further, the Holy Spirit <span
id="fr_2332"></span>[2333](#fn_2332) descended in bodily form as a dove,
indicating the firstfruits of our baptism and honouring the body: since
even this, that is the body, was God by the deification; and besides the
dove was wont formerly to announce the cessation of the flood. But to
the holy Apostles He came down in the form of fire: <span
id="fr_2333"></span>[2334](#fn_2333) for He is God, and *God is a
consuming fire*. <span id="fr_2334"></span>[2335](#fn_2334)

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p57"></span>Olive oil <span
id="fr_2335"></span>[2336](#fn_2335) is employed in baptism as a
significant of our anointing, <span id="fr_2336"></span>[2337](#fn_2336)
and as making us anointed, and as announcing to us through the Holy
Spirit God’s pity: for it was the fruit of the olive that the dove
brought to those who were saved from the flood. <span
id="fr_2337"></span>[2338](#fn_2337)

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p61"></span>John was baptized, putting his hand
upon the divine head of his Master, and with his own blood.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.ix-p62"></span>It does not behove <span
id="fr_2338"></span>[2339](#fn_2338) us to delay baptism when the faith
of those coming forward is testified to by their works. For he that
cometh forward deceitfully to baptism will receive condemnation rather
than benefit.
