<span id="iii.iv.i.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.i.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter III</span>.—*Proof that there is a
God.*

<span id="iii.iv.i.iii-p2"></span>That there is a God, then, is no
matter of doubt to those who receive the Holy Scriptures, the Old
Testament, I mean, and the New; nor indeed to most of the Greeks. For,
as we said <span id="fr_1422"></span>[1423](#fn_1422) , the knowledge of
the existence of God is implanted in us by nature. But since the
wickedness of the Evil One has prevailed so mightily against man’s
nature as even to drive some into denying the existence of God, that
most foolish and woe-fulest pit of destruction (whose folly David,
revealer of the Divine meaning, exposed when he said <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[1424](#fn_1423) , *The fool said in his heart,
There is no God*), so the disciples of the Lord and His Apostles, made
wise by the Holy Spirit and working wonders in His power and grace, took
them captive in the net of miracles and drew them up out of the depths
of ignorance <span id="fr_1424"></span>[1425](#fn_1424) to the light of
the knowledge of God. In like manner also their successors in grace and
worth, both pastors and teachers, having received the enlightening grace
of the Spirit, were wont, alike by the power of miracles and the word of
grace, to enlighten those walking in darkness and to bring back the
wanderers into the way. But as for us who <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1426](#fn_1425) are not recipients either of the
gift of miracles or the gift of teaching (for indeed we have rendered
ourselves unworthy of these by our passion for pleasure), come, let us
in connection with this theme discuss a few of those things which have
been delivered to us on this subject by the expounders of grace, calling
on the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

<span id="iii.iv.i.iii-p7"></span>All things, that exist, are either
created or uncreated. If, then, things are created, it follows that they
are also wholly mutable. For things, whose existence originated in
change, must also be subject to change, whether it be that they perish
or that they become other than they are by act of will <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1427](#fn_1426) . But if things are uncreated they
must in all consistency be also wholly immutable. For things which are
opposed in the nature of their existence must also be opposed in the
mode of their existence, that is to say, must have opposite properties:
who, then, will refuse to grant that all existing things, not only such
as come within the province of the senses, but even the very angels, are
subject to change and transformation and movement of various kinds? For
the things appertaining to the rational world, I mean angels and spirits
and demons, are subject to changes of will, whether it is a progression
or a retrogression in goodness, whether a struggle or a surrender; while
the others suffer changes of generation and destruction, of increase and
decrease, of quality and of movement in space. Things then that are
mutable are also wholly created. But things that are created must be the
work of some maker, and the maker cannot have been created. For if he
had been created, he also must surely have been created by some one, and
so on till we arrive at something uncreated. The Creator, then, being
uncreated, is also wholly immutable. And what could this be other than
Deity?

<span id="iii.iv.i.iii-p9"></span><span id="page_3b">p. 3b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.i.iii-Page_3b"></span>And even the very continuity of the
creation, and its preservation and government, teach us that there does
exist a Deity, who supports and maintains and preserves and ever
provides for this universe. For how <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1428](#fn_1427) could opposite natures, such as
fire and water, air and earth, have combined with each other so as to
form one complete world, and continue to abide in indissoluble union,
were there not some omnipotent power which bound them together and
always is preserving them from dissolution?

<span id="iii.iv.i.iii-p11"></span>What is it that gave order to things
of heaven and things of earth, and all those things that move in the air
and in the water, or rather to what was in existence before these, viz.,
to heaven and earth and air and the elements of fire and water?
What <span id="fr_1428"></span>[1429](#fn_1428) was it that mingled and
distributed these? What was it that set these in motion and keeps them
in their unceasing and unhindered course <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[1430](#fn_1429) ? Was it not the Artificer of these
things, and He Who hath implanted in everything the law whereby the
universe is carried on and directed? Who then is the Artificer of these
things? Is it not He Who created them and brought them into existence.
For we shall not attribute such a power to the spontaneous <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[1431](#fn_1430) . For, supposing their coming into
existence was due to the spontaneous; what of the power that put all in
order <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1432](#fn_1431) ? And let us grant
this, if you please. What of that which has preserved and kept them in
harmony with the original laws of their existence <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[1433](#fn_1432) ? Clearly it is something quite
distinct from the spontaneous <span id="fr_1433"></span>[1434](#fn_1433)
. And what could this be other than Deity <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[1435](#fn_1434) ?
