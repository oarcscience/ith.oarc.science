<span id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX</span>.—*Concerning the
waters.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p2"></span>Water also is one of the four
elements, the most beautiful of God’s creations. It is both wet and
cold, heavy, and with a tendency to descend, and flows with great
readiness. It is this the Holy Scripture has in view when it says, *And
darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
the face of the waters* <span id="fr_1742"></span>[1743](#fn_1742) . For
the deep is nothing else than a huge quantity of water whose limit man
cannot comprehend. In the beginning, indeed, the water lay all over the
surface of the earth. And first God created the firmament to divide the
water above the firmament from the water below the firmament. For in the
midst of the sea of waters the firmament was established at the Master’s
decree. And out of it God bade the firmament arise, and it arose. Now
for what reason was it that God placed water above the firmament? It was
because of the intense burning heat of the sun and ether <span
id="fr_1743"></span>[1744](#fn_1743) . For immediately under the
firmament is spread out the ether <span
id="fr_1744"></span>[1745](#fn_1744) , and the sun and moon and stars
are in the firmament, and so if water had not been put above it the
firmament would have been consumed by the heat <span
id="fr_1745"></span>[1746](#fn_1745) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p7"></span>Next, God bade the waters be gathered
together into one mass <span id="fr_1746"></span>[1747](#fn_1746) . But
when the Scrip<span id="page_27b">p. 27b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.ix-Page_27b"></span>ture speaks of one mass it evidently
does not mean that they were gathered together into one place: for
immediately it goes on to say, *And the gatherings of the waters He
called seas* <span id="fr_1747"></span>[1748](#fn_1747) : but the words
signify that the waters were separated off in a body from the earth into
distinct groups. Thus the waters were gathered together into their
special collections and the dry land was brought to view. And hence
arose the two seas that surround Egypt, for it lies between two seas.
These collections contain <span id="fr_1748"></span>[1749](#fn_1748)
various seas and mountains, and islands, and promontories, and harbours,
and surround various bays and beaches, and coastlands. For the word
beach is used when the nature of the tract is sandy, while coastland
signifies that it is rocky and deep close into shore, getting deep all
on a sudden. In like manner arose also the sea that lies where the sun
rises, the name of which is the Indian Sea: also the northern sea called
the Caspian. The lakes also were formed in the same manner.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p11"></span>The ocean, then, is like a river
encircling the whole earth, and I think it is concerning it that the
divine Scripture says, *A river went out of Paradise* <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[1750](#fn_1749) . The water of the ocean is sweet
and potable <span id="fr_1750"></span>[1751](#fn_1750) . It is it that
furnishes the seas with water which, because it stays a long time in the
seas and stands unmoved, becomes bitter: for the sun and the waterspouts
draw up always the finer parts. Thus it is that clouds are formed and
showers take place, because the filtration makes the water sweet.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p14"></span>This is parted into four first
divisions, that is to say, into four rivers. The name of the first is
Pheison, which is the Indian Ganges; the name of the second is Geon,
which is the Nile flowing from Ethiopia down to Egypt: the name of the
third is Tigris, and the name of the fourth is Euphrates. There are also
very many other mighty rivers of which some empty themselves into the
sea and others are used up in the earth. Thus the whole earth is bored
through and mined, and has, so to speak, certain veins through which it
sends up in springs the water it has received from the sea. The water of
the spring thus depends for its character on the quality of the earth.
For the sea water is filtered and strained through the earth and thus
becomes sweet. But if the place from which the spring arises is bitter
or briny, so also is the water that is sent up <span
id="fr_1751"></span>[1752](#fn_1751) . Moreover, it often happens that
water which has been closely pent up bursts through with violence, and
thus it becomes warm. And this is why they send forth waters that are
naturally warm.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p16"></span>By the divine decree hollow places
are made in the earth, and so into these the waters are gathered. And
this is how mountains are formed. God, then, bade the first water
produce living breath, since it was to be by water and the Holy Spirit
that moved upon the waters in the beginning <span
id="fr_1752"></span>[1753](#fn_1752) , that man was to be renewed. For
this is what the divine Basilius said: Therefore it produced living
creatures, small and big; whales and dragons, fish that swim in the
waters, and feathered fowl. The birds form a link between water and
earth and air: for they have their origin in the water, they live on the
earth and they fly in the air. Water, then, is the most beautiful
element and rich in usefulness, and purifies from all filth, and not
only from the filth of the body but from that of the soul, if it should
have received the grace of the Spirit <span
id="fr_1753"></span>[1754](#fn_1753) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p19"></span>*Concerning the seas* <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[1755](#fn_1754) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.ix-p21"></span>The Ægean Sea is received by the
Hellespont, which ends at Abydos and Sestus: next, the Propontis, which
ends at Chalcedon and Byzantium: here are the straits where the Pontus
arises. Next, the lake of Mæotis. Again, from the beginning of Europe
and Libya it is the Iberian Sea, which extends from the pillars of
Hercules to the Pyrenees mountain. Then the Ligurian Sea as far as the
borders of Etruria. Next, the Sardinian Sea, which is above Sardinia and
inclines downwards to Libya. Then the Etrurian Sea, which begins at the
extreme limits of Liguria and ends at Sicily. Then the Libyan Sea. Then
the Cretan, and Sicilian, and Ionian, and Adriatic Seas, the last of
which is poured out of the Sicilian Sea, which is called the Corinthian
Gulf, or the Alcyonian Sea. The Saronic Sea is surrounded by the Sunian
and Scyllæan Seas. Next is the Myrtoan Sea and the Icarian Sea, in which
are also the Cyclades. Then the Carpathian, and Pamphylian, and Egyptian
Seas: and, thereafter, above the Icarian Sea, the Ægean Sea pours itself
out. There is also the coast of Europe from the mouth of the Tanais
River to the Pillars of Hercules, 609,709 stadia: and that of Libya from
the Tigris, as far as the mouth of the Canobus, 209,252 <span
id="page_28b">p. 28b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.ix-Page_28b"></span>stadia: and lastly, that of Asia from
the Canobus to the Tanais, which, including the Gulf, is 4,111 stadia.
And so the full extent of the seaboard of the world that we inhabit with
the gulfs is 1,309,072 stadia <span id="fr_1755"></span>[1756](#fn_1755)
