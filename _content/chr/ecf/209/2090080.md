<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX</span>.—*Concerning
Providence.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p2"></span>Providence, then, is the care that
God takes over existing things. And again: Providence is the will of God
through which all existing things receive their fitting issue <span
id="fr_1886"></span>[1887](#fn_1886) . But if Providence is God’s will,
according to true reasoning all things that come into being through
Providence must necessarily be both most fair and most excellent, and
such that they cannot be surpassed. For the same person must of
necessity be creator of and provider for what exists: for it is not meet
nor fitting that the creator of what exists and the provider should be
separate persons. For in that case they would both assuredly be
deficient, the one in creating, the other in providing <span
id="fr_1887"></span>[1888](#fn_1887) . God therefore is both Creator and
Provider, and His creative and preserving and providing power is simply
His good-will. For *whatsoever the Lord pleased that did He in heaven
and in earth* <span id="fr_1888"></span>[1889](#fn_1888) , and *no one
resisted His will* <span id="fr_1889"></span>[1890](#fn_1889) . He
willed that all things should be and they were. He wills the universe to
be framed and it is framed, and all that He wills comes to pass.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p7"></span>That He provides, and that He
provides excellently <span id="fr_1890"></span>[1891](#fn_1890) , one
can most readily perceive thus. God alone is good and wise by nature.
Since then He is good, He provides: for he who does not provide is not
good. For even men and creatures without reason provide for their own
offspring according to their nature, and he who does not provide is
blamed. Again, since He is wise, He takes the best care over what
exists.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p9"></span>When, therefore, we give heed to
these things we ought to be filled with wonder at all the works of
Providence, and praise them all <span
id="fr_1891"></span>[1892](#fn_1891) , and accept them all without
enquiry, even though they are in the eyes of many unjust, because the
Providence of God is beyond our ken and comprehension, while our
reasonings and actions and the future are revealed to His eyes alone.
And by “all” I mean those that are not in our hands: for those that are
in our power are outside the sphere of Providence and within that of our
Free-will.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p11"></span>Now the works of Providence are
partly according to the good-will <span
id="fr_1892"></span>[1893](#fn_1892) (of God) and partly according to
permission <span id="fr_1893"></span>[1894](#fn_1893) . Works of
good-will include all those that are undeniably good, while works of
permission are…… <span id="fr_1894"></span>[1895](#fn_1894) . For
Providence often permits the just man to encounter misfortune in order
that he may reveal to others the virtue that lies concealed within
him <span id="fr_1895"></span>[1896](#fn_1895) , as was the case with
Job <span id="fr_1896"></span>[1897](#fn_1896) . At other times it
allows something strange to be done in order that something great and
marvellous might be accomplished through the seemingly-strange act, as
when the salvation of men was brought about through the Cross. In
another way it allows the pious man to suffer sore trials in order that
he may not depart from a right conscience nor lapse into pride on
account of the power and grace granted to him, as was the case with
Paul <span id="fr_1897"></span>[1898](#fn_1897) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p18"></span>One man is forsaken for a season
with a view to another’s restoration, in order that others when they see
his state may be taught a lesson <span
id="fr_1898"></span>[1899](#fn_1898) , as in the case of Lazarus and the
rich man <span id="fr_1899"></span>[1900](#fn_1899) . For it belongs to
our nature to be <span id="page_42b">p. 42b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-Page_42b"></span>cast down when we see persons in
distress. Another is deserted by Providence in order that another may be
glorified, and not for his own sin or that of his parents, just as the
man who was blind from his birth ministered to the glory of the Son of
Man <span id="fr_1900"></span>[1901](#fn_1900) . Again another is
permitted to suffer in order to stir up emulation in the breasts of
others, so that others by magnifying the glory of the sufferer may
resolutely welcome suffering in the hope of future glory and the desire
for future blessings, as in the case of the martyrs. Another is allowed
to fall at times into some act of baseness in order that another worse
fault may be thus corrected, as for instance when God allows a man who
takes pride in his virtue and righteousness to fall away into
fornication in order that he may be brought through this fall into the
perception of his own weakness and be humbled and approach and make
confession to the Lord.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p22"></span>Moreover, it is to be
observed <span id="fr_1901"></span>[1902](#fn_1901) that the choice of
what is to be done is in our own hands <span
id="fr_1902"></span>[1903](#fn_1902) : but the final issue depends, in
the one case when our actions are good, on the cooperation of God, Who
in His justice brings help according to His foreknowledge to such as
choose the good with a right conscience, and, in the other case when our
actions are to evil, on the desertion by God, Who again in His justice
stands aloof in accordance with His foreknowledge <span
id="fr_1903"></span>[1904](#fn_1903) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p26"></span>Now there are two forms of
desertion: for there is desertion in the matters of guidance and
training, and there is complete and hopeless desertion. The former has
in view the restoration and safety and glory of the sufferer, or the
rousing of feelings of emulation and imitation in others, or the glory
of God: but the latter is when man, after God has done all that was
possible to save him, remains of his own set purpose blind and uncured,
or rather incurable, and then he is handed over to utter destruction, as
was Judas <span id="fr_1904"></span>[1905](#fn_1904) . May God be
gracious to us, and deliver us from such desertion.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p28"></span>Observe further that the ways of
God’s providence are many, and they cannot be explained in words nor
conceived by the mind.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p29"></span>And remember that all the assaults
of dark and evil fortune contribute to the salvation of those who
receive them with thankfulness, and are assuredly ambassadors of help.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p30"></span>Also one must bear in mind <span
id="fr_1905"></span>[1906](#fn_1905) that God’s original wish was that
all should be saved and come to His Kingdom <span
id="fr_1906"></span>[1907](#fn_1906) . For it was not for punishment
that He formed us but to share in His goodness, inasmuch as He is a good
God. But inasmuch as He is a just God, His will is that sinners should
suffer punishment.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p33"></span>The first then is called God’s
antecedent will and pleasure, and springs from Himself, while the second
is called God’s consequent will and permission, and has its origin in
us. And the latter is two-fold; one part dealing with matters of
guidance and training, and having in view our salvation, and the other
being hopeless and leading to our utter punishment, as we said above.
And this is the case with actions that are not left in our hands <span
id="fr_1907"></span>[1908](#fn_1907) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxix-p35"></span>But of actions that are in our
hands the good ones depend on His antecedent goodwill and pleasure,
while the wicked ones depend neither on His antecedent nor on His
consequent will, but are a concession to free-will. For that which is
the result of compulsion has neither reason nor virtue in it. God <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[1909](#fn_1908) makes provision for all creation
and makes all creation the instrument of His help and training, yea
often even the demons themselves, as for example in the cases of Job and
the swine <span id="fr_1909"></span>[1910](#fn_1909) .
