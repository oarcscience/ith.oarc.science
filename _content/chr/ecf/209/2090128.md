<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-Page_88b"></span><span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p1.1"></span>Chapter XVI</span>.—*Concerning
Images* <span id="fr_2495"></span>[2496](#fn_2495) .

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p3"></span>But since some <span
id="fr_2496"></span>[2497](#fn_2496) find fault with us for worshipping
and honouring the image of our Saviour and that of our Lady, and those,
too, of the rest of the saints and servants of Christ, let them remember
that in the beginning God created man after His own image <span
id="fr_2497"></span>[2498](#fn_2497) . On what grounds, then, do we shew
reverence to each other unless because we are made after God’s image?
For as Basil, that much-versed expounder of divine things, says, the
honour given to the image passes over to the prototype <span
id="fr_2498"></span>[2499](#fn_2498) . Now a prototype is that which is
imaged, from which the derivative is obtained. Why was it that the
Mosaic people honoured on all hands the tabernacle <span
id="fr_2499"></span>[2500](#fn_2499) which bore an image and type of
heavenly things, or rather of the whole creation? God indeed said to
Moses, *Look that thou make them after their pattern which was shewed
thee in the mount* <span id="fr_2500"></span>[2501](#fn_2500) . The
Cherubim, too, which o’ershadow the mercy seat, are they not the work of
men’s hands <span id="fr_2501"></span>[2502](#fn_2501) ? What, further,
is the celebrated temple at Jerusalem? Is it not hand-made and fashioned
by the skill of men <span id="fr_2502"></span>[2503](#fn_2502) ?

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p11"></span>Moreover the divine Scripture blames
those who worship graven images, but also those who sacrifice to demons.
The Greeks sacrificed and the Jews also sacrificed: but the Greeks to
demons and the Jews to God. And the sacrifice of the Greeks was rejected
and condemned, but the sacrifice of the just was very acceptable to God.
For Noah sacrificed, and *God smelled a sweet savour* <span
id="fr_2503"></span>[2504](#fn_2503) , receiving the fragrance of the
right choice and good-will towards Him. And so the graven images of the
Greeks, since they were images of deities, were rejected and forbidden.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p13"></span>But besides this who can make an
imitation of the invisible, incorporeal, uncircumscribed, formless God?
Therefore to give form to the Deity is the height of folly and impiety.
And hence it is that in the Old Testament the use of images was not
common. But after God <span id="fr_2504"></span>[2505](#fn_2504) in His
bowels of pity became in truth man for our salvation, not as He was seen
by Abraham in the semblance of a man, nor as He was seen by the
prophets, but in being truly man, and after He lived upon the earth and
dwelt among men <span id="fr_2505"></span>[2506](#fn_2505) , worked
miracles, suffered, was crucified, rose again and was taken back to
Heaven, since all these things actually took place and were seen by men,
they were written for the remembrance and instruction of us who were not
alive at that time in order that though we saw not, we may still,
hearing and believing, obtain the blessing of the Lord. But seeing that
not every one has a knowledge of letters nor time for reading, the
Fathers gave their sanction to depicting these events on images as being
acts of great heroism, in order that they should form a concise memorial
of them. Often, doubtless, when we have not the Lord’s passion in mind
and see the image of Christ’s crucifixion, His saving passion is brought
back to remembrance, and we fall down and worship not the material but
that which is imaged: just as we do not worship the material of which
the Gospels are made, nor the material of the Cross, but that which
these typify. For wherein does the cross, that typifies the Lord, differ
from a cross that does not do so? It is just the same also in the case
of the Mother of the Lord. For the honour which we give to her is
referred to Him Who was made of her incarnate. And similarly also the
brave acts of holy men stir us up to be brave and to emulate and imitate
their valour and to glorify God. For as we said, the honour that is
given to the best of fellow-servants is a proof of good-will towards our
common Lady, and the honour rendered to the image passes over to the
prototype <span id="fr_2506"></span>[2507](#fn_2506) . But this is an
unwritten tradition <span id="fr_2507"></span>[2508](#fn_2507) , just as
is also the worshipping towards the East and the worship of the Cross,
and very many other similar things.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p18"></span>A certain tale <span
id="fr_2508"></span>[2509](#fn_2508) , too, is told <span
id="fr_2509"></span>[2510](#fn_2509) , how that when Augarus <span
id="fr_2510"></span>[2511](#fn_2510) was king over the city of the
Edessenes, he sent a portrait painter to paint a likeness of the Lord,
and when the painter could not paint because of the brightness that
shone from His countenance, the Lord Himself put a garment over His own
divine and life-giving face and impressed on it an image of Himself and
sent this to Augarus, to satisfy thus his desire.

<span id="iii.iv.iv.xvi-p22"></span>Moreover that the Apostles handed
down much that was unwritten, Paul, the Apostle of the Gentiles, tells
us in these words: *Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the
traditions which ye have been taught of us, whether by word or by
epistle* <span id="fr_2511"></span>[2512](#fn_2511) . And to the
Corinthians he writes, *Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me
in all things, and keep the traditions as I have delivered them to
you* <span id="fr_2512"></span>[2513](#fn_2512) .”
