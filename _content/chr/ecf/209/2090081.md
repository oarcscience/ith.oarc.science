<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c12"><span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXX</span>.—*Concerning
Prescience and Predestination.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-p2"></span>We ought to understand <span
id="fr_1910"></span>[1911](#fn_1910) that while God knows all things
beforehand, yet He does not predetermine all things <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[1912](#fn_1911) . For He knows beforehand those
things that are in our power, but He does not predetermine them. For it
is not His will that there should be wickedness nor does He choose to
compel virtue. So that predetermination is the work of the divine
command based on fore-knowledge <span
id="fr_1912"></span>[1913](#fn_1912) . But on the other hand God
predetermines those things which are not within our power in accordance
with His prescience. For already God in His prescience has prejudged all
things in accordance with His goodness and justice.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-p6"></span>Bear in mind, too <span
id="fr_1913"></span>[1914](#fn_1913) , that virtue is a gift from God
implanted in our nature, and that He Himself is the source and cause of
all good, <span id="page_43b">p. 43b</span> <span
id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-Page_43b"></span>and without His co-operation <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[1915](#fn_1914) and help we cannot will or do any
good thing. But we have it in our power either to abide in virtue and
follow God, Who calls us into ways of virtue, or to stray from paths of
virtue, which is to dwell in wickedness, and to follow the devil who
summons but cannot compel us. For wickedness is nothing else than the
withdrawal of goodness, just as darkness is nothing else than the
withdrawal of light. While then we abide in the natural state we abide
in virtue, but when we deviate from the natural state, that is from
virtue, we come into an unnatural state and dwell in wickedness <span
id="fr_1915"></span>[1916](#fn_1915) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-p10"></span>Repentance is the returning from the
unnatural into the natural state, from the devil to God, through
discipline and effort.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-p11"></span>Man then the Creator made male,
giving him to share in His own divine grace, and bringing him thus into
communion with Himself: and thus it was that he gave in the manner of a
prophet the names to living things, with authority as though they were
given to be his slaves. For having been endowed with reason and mind,
and free-will after the image of God, he was fitly entrusted with
dominion over earthly things by the common Creator and Master of all.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-p12"></span>But since God in His
prescience <span id="fr_1916"></span>[1917](#fn_1916) knew that man
would transgress and become liable to destruction, He made from him a
female to be a help to him like himself; a help, indeed, for the
conservation of the race after the transgression from age to age by
generation. For the earliest formation is called ‘making’ and not
‘generation.’ For ‘making’ is the original formation at God’s hands,
while ‘generation’ is the succession from each other made necessary by
the sentence of death imposed on us on account of the transgression.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-p14"></span>This man He <span
id="fr_1917"></span>[1918](#fn_1917) placed in Paradise, a home that was
alike spiritual and sensible. For he lived in the body on the earth in
the realm of sense, while he dwelt in the spirit among the angels,
cultivating divine thoughts, and being supported by them: living in
naked simplicity a life free from artificiality, and being led up
through His creations to the one and only Creator, in Whose
contemplation he found joy and gladness <span
id="fr_1918"></span>[1919](#fn_1918) .

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-p17"></span>When therefore He had furnished his
nature with free-will, He imposed a law on him, not to taste of the tree
of knowledge. Concerning this tree, we have said as much as is necessary
in the chapter about Paradise, at least as much as it was in our power
to say. And with this command He gave the promise that, if he should
preserve the dignity of the soul by giving the victory to reason, and
acknowledging his Creator and observing His command, he should share
eternal blessedness and live to all eternity, proving mightier than
death: but if forsooth he should subject the soul to the body, and
prefer the delights of the body, comparing himself in ignorance of his
true dignity to the senseless beasts <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[1920](#fn_1919) , and shaking off His Creator’s
yoke, and neglecting His divine injunction, he will be liable to death
and corruption, and will be compelled to labour throughout a miserable
life. For it was no profit to man to obtain incorruption while still
untried and unproved, lest he should fall into pride and under the
judgment of the devil. For through his incorruption the devil, when he
had fallen as the result of his own free choice, was firmly established
in wickedness, so that there was no room for repentance and no hope of
change: just as, moreover, the angels also, when they had made free
choice of virtue became through grace immoveably rooted in goodness.

<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-p19"></span>It was necessary, therefore, that
man should first be put to the test (for man untried and unproved <span
id="fr_1920"></span>[1921](#fn_1920) would be worth nothing <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[1922](#fn_1921) ), and being made perfect by the
trial through the observance of the command should thus receive
incorruption as the prize of his virtue. For being intermediate between
God and matter he was destined, if he kept the command, to be delivered
from his natural relation to existing things and to be made one with
God’s estate, and to be immoveably established in goodness, but, if he
transgressed and inclined the rather to what was material, and tore his
mind from the Author of his being, I mean God, his fate was to be
corruption, and he was to become subject to passion instead of
passionless, and mortal instead of immortal, and dependent on connection
and unsettled generation. And in his desire for life he would cling to
pleasures as though they were necessary to maintain it, and would
fearlessly abhor those who sought to deprive him of these, and transfer
his desire from God to matter, and his anger from the real enemy of his
salvation to his own brethren. The <span id="page_44b">p. 44b</span>
<span id="iii.iv.ii.xxx-Page_44b"></span>envy of the <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[1923](#fn_1922) devil then was the reason of man’s
fall. For that same demon, so full of envy and with such a hatred of
good, would not suffer us to enjoy the pleasures of heaven, when he
himself was kept below on account of his arrogance, and hence the false
one tempts miserable man with the hope of Godhead, and leading him up to
as great a height of arrogance as himself, he hurls him down into a pit
of destruction just as deep.
