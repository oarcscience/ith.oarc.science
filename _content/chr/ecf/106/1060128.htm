<p class="c39"><a name="vi.v.xxxii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.v.xxxii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXXI.&#8212;Of the Account Given by Matthew and Luke of the Occasion When John the Baptist Was in Prison, and Despatched His Disciples on a Mission to the Lord.</span></p>  			 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.v.xxxii-p2"></A>78. Matthew proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: &#8220;And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding His twelve disciples, He departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities. Now, when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, and said unto Him, Art thou He that should come, or do we look for another?&#8221; and so on, until we come to the words, &#8220;And Wisdom is justified of her children.&#8221;  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_990"></A><A HREF="#fn_990"><FONT SIZE="1">991</FONT></A>
 This whole section relating to John the Baptist, touching the message which he sent to Jesus, and the tenor of the reply which those whom he despatched received, and the terms in which the Lord spoke of John after the departure of these persons, is introduced also by Luke.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_991"></A><A HREF="#fn_991"><FONT SIZE="1">992</FONT></A>
 The order, however, is not the same. But it is not made clear which of them gives the order of his own recollections, and which keeps by the historical succession of the things themselves.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_992"></A><A HREF="#fn_992"><FONT SIZE="1">993</FONT></A>
