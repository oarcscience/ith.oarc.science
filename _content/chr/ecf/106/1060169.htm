<p class="c39"><a name="vi.v.lxxiii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.v.lxxiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter LXXII.&#8212;Of the Harmony Characterizing the Narratives Given by These Three Evangelists Regarding the Duty of Rendering to C&aelig;sar the Coin Bearing His Image, and Regarding the Woman Who Had Been Married to the Seven Brothers.</span></p>  			 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.v.lxxiii-p2"></A>140. Matthew then continues in these terms: <A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A> <a name="vi.v.lxxiii-Page_165"></A>&#8220;Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle Him in His talk. And they send out unto Him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man; for thou regardest not the person of men: tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, or not?&#8221; and so on, 				down to the words, &#8220;And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at His doctrine.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1165"></A><A HREF="#fn_1165"><FONT SIZE="1">1166</FONT></A>
 Mark and Luke give a similar account of these two replies made by the Lord,&#8212;namely, the one on the subject of the coin, which was prompted by the question as to the duty of giving tribute to C&aelig;sar; and the other on the subject of the resurrection, which was suggested by the case of the woman who had married the seven brothers in succession. Neither do these two evangelists differ in the matter of the order.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1166"></A><A HREF="#fn_1166"><FONT SIZE="1">1167</FONT></A>
 For after the parable which told of the men to whom the vineyard was let out, and which also dealt with the Jews (against whom it was directed), and the evil counsel they were devising (which sections are given by all three evangelists together), these two, Mark and Luke, pass over the parable of the guests who were invited to the wedding (which only Matthew has introduced), and thereafter they join company again with the first evangelist, when they record these two passages 				which deal with C&aelig;sar&#146;s tribute, and the woman who was the wife of seven different husbands, inserting them in precisely the same order, with a consistency which admits of no question.</p>
