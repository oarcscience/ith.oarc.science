<span id="vii.lxxvi-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.lxxvi-p3.1"></span>*[John v.
2](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#002)<span id="vii.lxxvi-p3.2"></span>,
“Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool,” etc.*

<span id="vii.lxxvi-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lxxvi-p4.1"></span>The</span> lesson of the Gospel has just
sounded in our ears, and made us intent to know what is the meaning of
what has been read. This, I suppose, is looked for from me, this I
promise, by the Lord’s assistance, to explain as well as I can. For
without doubt it is not without a meaning, that those miracles were
done, and something they figured out to us bearing on eternal
saving <span id="fr_3676"></span>[3677](#fn_3676) health. For the health
of the body which was restored to this man, of how long duration was it?
“For what is your life?” saith Holy Scripture; “it is a vapour that
appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.” <span
id="fr_3677"></span>[3678](#fn_3677) Therefore in that health was
restored to this man’s body for a time, some enduringness was restored
to a vapour. So then this is not to be valued much; “Vain is the health
of man.” <span id="fr_3678"></span>[3679](#fn_3678) And, brethren,
recollect that Prophetical and Evangelical testimony, for it is read in
the Gospel; “All flesh is grass, and all the glory of flesh as the
flower of grass; the grass withereth, the flower falleth away, the Word
of the Lord endureth for ever.” <span
id="fr_3679"></span>[3680](#fn_3679) The Word of the Lord communicateth
glory even to the grass, and no transitory glory; for even to flesh He
giveth immortality.

<span id="vii.lxxvi-p9"></span>2. But first passeth away the tribulation
of this life, out of which He giveth us help, to whom we have said,
“Give us help from tribulation.” <span
id="fr_3680"></span>[3681](#fn_3680) And all this life is indeed a
tribulation to the understanding. For there are two tormentors of the
soul, torturing it not at once, but alternating their tortures. These
two tormentors’ names are, Fear and Sorrow. When it is well with thee,
thou art in fear; when it is ill, thou art in sorrow. This world’s
prosperity, whom doth it not deceive, its adversity not break? In this
grass, and in the days of grass, the surer way must be kept to, the Word
of God. For when it had been said, “All flesh is grass, and all the
glory of flesh as the flower of grass, the grass withereth, the flower
falleth away;” as though we should ask, “What hope has grass? what
stability the flower of grass?” it is said, “but the Word of the Lord
endureth for ever.” And whence, you will say, is that Word to me? “The
Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us.” <span
id="fr_3681"></span>[3682](#fn_3681) For the Word of the Lord saith to
thee, “Do not reject My promise, for I have not rejected thy grass.”
This then that the Word of the Lord hath granted to us, that we might
hold to Him, that we might not pass away with the flower of grass; this,
I say, that He hath granted to us, that the Word should be made Flesh,
taking Flesh, not changed into flesh, abiding, and assuming, abiding
what He was, assuming what He was not; this, I say, that He hath granted
to us, that pool also signifies. <span
id="fr_3682"></span>[3683](#fn_3682)

<span id="page_475">p. 475</span> <span id="vii.lxxvi-Page_475"></span>

<span id="vii.lxxvi-p13"></span>3. I am speaking briefly. That water was
the Jewish people; the five porches were the Law. For Moses wrote five
books. Therefore was the water enclosed by five porches as that people
was held in by the Law. The troubling of the water is the Lord’s Passion
among that people. He who descended was healed, and only one; for this
is unity. Whosoever are offended at the Passion of Christ are proud;
they will not descend, they are not healed. And, say they, “Am I to
believe that God was Incarnate, that God was born of a woman, that God
was crucified, scourged, dead, wounded, buried?” Be it far from me to
believe this of God, it is unworthy of Him. Let the heart speak, not the
neck. To the proud the humiliation of the Lord seems unworthy of Him,
therefore is saving health from such far off. Lift not thyself up; if
thou wouldest be made whole, descend. Well might piety be alarmed, if
Christ in the flesh subject to change were only spoken of. But now the
truth sets forth to thee, Christ Unchangeable in His Nature as the Word.
For, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God;” not a
word to sound, and so pass away; for “the Word was God.” <span
id="fr_3683"></span>[3684](#fn_3683) So then thy God endureth
unchangeable. O true piety; thy God endureth, fear not; He doth not
perish, and through Him, thou too dost not perish. He endureth, He is
born of a woman, but in the Flesh. The Word made even His Mother. He who
was before He was made, made her in whom He was to be made Himself. He
was an infant, but in the Flesh. He sucked, He grew, He took
nourishment, He ran through the several stages of life, He came to man’s
estate, but in the Flesh. He was wearied, and He slept, but in the
Flesh. He suffered hunger and thirst, but in the Flesh. He was
apprehended, bound, scourged, assailed with railings, crucified finally,
and killed, but in the Flesh. Why art thou alarmed? “The Word of the
Lord endureth for ever.” Whoso rejecteth this humiliation of God, doth
not wish for healing from the deadly swelling of pride.

<span id="vii.lxxvi-p15"></span>4. So then by His Flesh did the Lord
Jesus Christ grant hope to our flesh. For He took on Him what we knew
well in this earth, what aboundeth here, to be born, and to die. To be
born and to die, abounded here; to rise again and to live for ever, was
not here. Poor earthly merchandize found He here, He brought here
strange and heavenly. If thou art alarmed at death, love the
resurrection. He hath given thee help out of tribulation; for vain thy
health had ever been. Let us acknowledge therefore and love the saving
health in this world strange, that is, health everlasting, and live we
in this world as strangers. Let us think that we are but passing away,
so shall we be sinning less. Let us rather give thanks to our Lord God,
that He hath been pleased that the last day of this life should be both
near and uncertain. From the earliest infancy even to decrepit old age,
it is but a short span. If Adam had died to-day, what would it have
profited him, that he had lived so long? What “long time” is there in
that in which there is an end? No one recalleth yesterday; to-day is
pressed on by to-morrow, that it may pass away. In this little span let
us live well, that we may go whence we may not pass away. And now even
as we are talking, we are indeed passing away. Our words run on, and the
hours fly by; so does our age, so our actions, so our honours, so our
misery, so our happiness here below. All passeth away, but let us not be
alarmed; “The Word of God endureth for ever.” Let us turn to the Lord,
etc.
