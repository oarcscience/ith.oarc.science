<span id="vii.lxx-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.lxx-p1.1"></span>Sermon LXVIII.</span>

<span id="vii.lxx-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.lxx-p2.1"></span>\[CXVIII. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.lxx-p3"></span>*On the same words of the Gospel,* <span
id="vii.lxx-p3.1"></span>*John i., “In the beginning was the word,”
etc.*

<span id="vii.lxx-p4"></span>1. <span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lxx-p4.1"></span>All</span> ye who are looking for a man’s many
words, understand the One Word of God, “In the beginning was the
Word.” <span id="fr_3597"></span>[3598](#fn_3597) Now, “In the beginning
God made the heaven and the earth.” <span
id="fr_3598"></span>[3599](#fn_3598) But, “The Word was,” since we have
heard, “In the beginning God made.” Acknowledge we in Him the Creator;
for Creator is He who made; and the creature what He made. For no
creature which was made “was,” as God the Word “was,” by whom it was
made, always. Now when we heard “The Word was,” with whom was It? We
understand the Father who did not make nor create the Same Word, but
begat Him. For, “In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.”
Whereby made He them? “The Word was, and the Word was with God;” <span
id="fr_3599"></span>[3600](#fn_3599) but what kind of Word? Did it sound
and so pass away? Was it a mere thought, and motion <span
id="fr_3600"></span>[3601](#fn_3600) of the mind? No. Was it suggested
by memory, and uttered? No. What kind of Word then? Why dost thou look
for many words from me? “The Word was God.” When we hear, “The Word was
God,” we do not make a second God; but we understand the Son. For the
Word is the Son of God. Lo, the Son, and What but God? For “The Word was
God.” What the Father? God of course. If the Father is God and the Son
God, do we make two Gods? God forbid. The Father is God, the Son God;
but the Father and the Son One God. For the Only Son of God was not
made, but born. “In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth;”
but the Word was of the Father. Was the Word therefore made by the
Father? No. “All things were made by Him.” <span
id="fr_3601"></span>[3602](#fn_3601) If by Him all things were made, was
He too made by Himself? Do not imagine that He by whom thou hearest all
things were made was Himself made among all things. For if He were made
Himself, all things were not made by Him, but Himself was made among the
rest. You say, “He was made;” what, by Himself? Who can make himself? If
then He was made, how by Him were all things made? See, Himself too was
made, as you say, not I, for that He was begotten, I do not deny. If
then you say that He was made, I ask by what, by whom? By Himself? Then
He “was,” before He was made, that He might make Himself. But if all
things were made by Him, understand that He was not Himself made. If
thou art not able to understand, believe, that thou mayest understand.
Faith goes before; understanding follows after; since the Prophet says,
“Unless ye believe, ye shall not understand. <span
id="fr_3602"></span>[3603](#fn_3602) The Word was.” Look not for time in
Him, by whom times were made. “The Word was.” But you say, “There was a
time that the Word was not.” You say falsely; nowhere do you read this.
But I do read for you, “In the beginning was the Word.” What look you
for before the beginning? But if you should be able to find anything
before the beginning, this will be the beginning. He is mad who looks
for anything before the beginning. What then doth he say was before the
beginning? “In the beginning was the Word.”

<span id="vii.lxx-p11"></span>2. But you will say, “The Father both
‘was,’ and was before the Word.” What are you looking for? “In the
beginning was the Word.” What you find, understand; seek not for what
you are not able to find. Nothing is before the beginning. “In the
beginning was the Word.” The Son is the Brightness of the Father. Of the
Wisdom of the Father, which is the Son, it is said, “For He is the
brightness of the Everlasting Light.” <span
id="fr_3603"></span>[3604](#fn_3603) Are you seeking for a Son without a
Father? Give me a light without brightness. If there was a time when the
Son was not, the Father was a light obscure. For how was He not an
obscure Light, if It had no brightness? So then the Father always, the
Son always. If the Father always, the Son always. Do you ask of me,
whether the Son were born? I answer, “born.” For He would not be a Son
if not born. So when I say, the Son always was, I say in fact was always
born. And who understands, “Was always born”? Give me an eternal fire,
and I will give thee an eternal brightness. We bless God who hath given
to us the holy Scriptures. Be ye not blind in the brightness of the
light. Brightness is engendered of the Light, and yet the Brightness is
Coeternal with the Light that engenders It. The Light always, its
Brightness always. It begat Its Own Brightness; but was it ever without
Its Brightness? Let God be allowed to beget an eternal Son. I pray you
hear of whom we are speaking; hear, mark, believe, understand. Of God
are we speaking. We confess <span id="page_466">p. 466</span> <span
id="vii.lxx-Page_466"></span>and believe the Son coeternal with the
Father. But you will say, “When a man begets a Son, he that begets is
the elder, and he that is begotten the younger.” It is true; in the case
of men, he that begets is the elder, and he that is begotten, the
younger, and he arrives in time to his father’s strength. But why, save
that whilst the one grows, the other grows old? Let the father stand
still a while, and in his growing the son will follow on him, and you
will see him equal. But see, I give you whereby to understand this. Fire
engenders a coeval brightness. Among men you only find sons younger,
fathers older; you do not find them coeval: but as I have said, I show
you brightness coeval with its parent fire. For fire begets brightness,
yet is it never without brightness. Since then you see that the
brightness is coeval with its fire, suffer God to beget a Coeternal Son.
Whoso understandeth, let him rejoice: but whoso understandeth not, let
him believe. For the word of the Prophet cannot be disannulled; “Unless
ye believe, ye shall not understand.” <span
