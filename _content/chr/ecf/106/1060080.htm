<p class="c39"><a name="vi.iv.xx-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.iv.xx-p1.1"></A>Chapter XX.&#8212;Of the Fact that Nothing is Discovered to Have Been Predicted by the Prophets of the Pagans in Opposition to the God of the Hebrews.</span></p>  			 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.iv.xx-p2"></A>28. Or let them aver, if they are able, that some Sibyl of theirs, or any one whatever among their other prophets, announced long ago that it would come to pass that the God of the Hebrews, the God of Israel, would be worshipped by all nations, declaring, at the same time, that the worshippers of other gods before that time had rightly rejected Him; and again, that the compositions of His prophets would be in such exalted authority,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_572"></A><A HREF="#fn_572"><FONT SIZE="1">573</FONT></A>
 that in obedience to them the Roman government itself would command the destruction of images, the said seers at the same time giving warning against acting upon such ordinances;&#8212;let them, I say, read out any utterances like these, if they can, from any of the books of their prophets. For I stop not to state that those things which we can read in their books repeat a testimony on behalf of our religion, that is, the Christian religon, which they might have heard from the 				holy angels and from our prophets themselves; just as the very devils were compelled to confess Christ when He was present in the flesh. But I pass by these matters, regarding which, when we bring them forward, their contention is that they were invented by our party. Most certainly, however, they may themselves be pressed to adduce anything which has been prophesied by the seers of their own gods against the God of the Hebrews; as, on our side, we can point to declarations so remarkable at 				once for number and for weight recorded in the books of our prophets against their gods, in which also we can both note the command and recite the prediction and demonstrate the event. And over the realization of these things, that comparatively small number of heathens who have remained such are more inclined to grieve than they are ready to acknowledge that God who has had the power to foretell these things as events destined to be made good; whereas in their dealings with their own false 				gods, who are genuine demons, they prize nothing else so highly as to be informed by their responses of something which is to take place with them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_573"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">574</FONT></A>
