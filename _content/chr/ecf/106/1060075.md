<span id="vi.iv.xv-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.xv-p1.1"></span>Chapter XV.—Of the Fact that the Pagans, When
Constrained to Laud Christ, Have Launched Their Insults Against His
Disciples.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv-p2"></span>23. But what shall be said to this, if
those vain eulogizers of Christ, and those crooked slanderers of the
Christian religion, lack the daring to blaspheme Christ, for this
particular reason that some of their philosophers, as Porphyry of
Sicily <span id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563) has given us to
understand in his books, consulted their gods as to their response on
the subject of \[the claims of\] Christ, and were constrained by their
own oracles to laud Christ? Nor should that seem incredible. For we also
read in the Gospel that the demons confessed Him; <span
id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564) and in our prophets it is written in
this wise: “For the gods of the nations are demons.” <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565) Thus it happens, then, that in order
to avoid attempting aught in opposition to the responses of their own
deities, they turn their blasphemies aside from Christ, and pour them
forth against His disciples. It seems to me, however, that these gods of
the Gentiles, whom the philosophers of the pagans may have consulted, if
they were asked to give their judgment on the disciples of Christ, as
well as on Christ Himself, would be constrained to praise them in like
manner.

id="vi.iv.xv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.xv-p3"></span> The philosopher of the Neo-Platonic
school, better known as one of the earliest and most learned antagonists
of Christianity. Though a native either of Tyre or Batanea, he is called
here, as also again in the *Retractations*, ii. 31, a Sicilian, because,
according to Jerome and Eusebius (*Hist. Eccles*. vi. 19), it was in
Sicily that he wrote his treatise in fifteen books against the Christian
religion.—<span class="c13"><span id="vi.iv.xv-p3.1"></span>Tr</span>.
