<p class="c55"><a name="vii.lxxii-p3"></A><i>On the same words of</i> <a name="vii.lxxii-p3.1"></A><i>John i</i><i>., &#8220;In the beginning was the word,&#8221; etc.</i></p>  		  
<p class="c21"><a name="vii.lxxii-p4"></A>1. <span class="c13"><a name="vii.lxxii-p4.1"></A>The</span> beginning of John&#146;s Gospel, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3617"></A><A HREF="#fn_3617"><FONT SIZE="1">3618</FONT></A>
 Thus he begins, this he saw, and transcending the whole creation, mountains, air, the heavens, the stars, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, all Angels, and Archangels, transcending all; he saw the Word in the beginning, and drank It in. He saw above every creature, he drank in from the Lord&#146;s breast. For this same St. John the Evangelist is he whom Jesus specially loved; insomuch that he lay on His Breast at supper. There was this secret, that therefrom might be 			 drunk in, what in the Gospel was to be poured forth. Happy they who hear and understand. Of the next degree of blessedness are they who though they understand not, believe. For how great a <A NAME="page_468"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 468</FONT></A> <a name="vii.lxxii-Page_468"></A>thing it is to see This Word of God, who can explain in human words?</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.lxxii-p6"></A>2. Lift up your hearts, my Brethren, lift them up as best ye can; whatsoever occurs to you from the idea of any body whatsoever, reject. If the Word of God occurs to you under the idea of the light of this sun, expand, extend how you will, set no bounds in your thought to that light; it is nothing to the Word of God. Whatsoever of this sort the mind conceives, is less in one part than in the whole. Of theWord conceive as Whole everywhere. Understand ye what I say; 			 because of my stress of time I am limiting myself as much as I can for your sakes. Understand ye what I say. Lo, this light from heaven, which is called by the name of the sun, when it comes forth, it enlightens the earth, unfolds the day, develops forms, distinguishes colours. Great blessing it is, great gift of God to all mortal men; let His works magnify Him. If the sun is so beauteous, what more beauteous than the sun&#146;s Maker? And yet look, Brethren; lo, he pours his rays through the 			 whole earth; penetrates open places, the closed resist him; he sends his light through windows; can he also through a wall? To the Word of God all is open, from the Word of God nothing is hid. Observe another difference, how far from the Creator is the creature, especially the bodily creature. When the sun is in the East, it is not in the West. Its light indeed shed from that vast body reaches even to the West; but itself is not there. When it begins to set, then it will be there. When it 			 rises, it is in the East; when it sets it is in the West. By these operations of his, it has given name to those quarters. Because it is in the East when it rises at the East, it has made it be called the Rising Sun; because it is at the West when it sets at the West, it has made it be called the Setting Sun. At night it is nowhere seen. Is the Word of God so? When It is in the East, is It not in the West; or when It is in the West, is It not in the East? or does It ever leave the earth, and go 			 under or behind the earth? It is Whole everywhere. Who can in words explain this? Who see it? By what means of proof shall I establish to you what I say? I am speaking as a man, it is to men I speak; I am speaking as one weak, to men weaker am I speaking. And yet, my brethren, I am bold to say that I do in some sort see what I am saying to you, though &#8220;through a glass,&#8221; or &#8220;darkly,&#8221; I do in some sort understand even within my heart a word touching this thing. But it seeks to go forth to 			 you, and finds no meet vehicle. The vehicle of the word is the sound of the voice. What I am saying within mine own self I seek to say to you, and words fail. For I wish to speak of the Word of God. How great a Word, what kind of Word? &#8220;All things were made by Him.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3618"></A><A HREF="#fn_3618"><FONT SIZE="1">3619</FONT></A>
 See the works, and stand in awe of the Worker. &#8220;All things were made by Him.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p class="c22"><a name="vii.lxxii-p8"></A>3. Return with me, O human infirmity, return, I say. Let us comprehend these human things if we can. We are men, I who speak, I am a man, and to men I speak, and utter the sound of my voice. I convey the sound of my voice to men&#146;s ears, and by the sound of my voice I somehow through the ear lay up understanding also in the heart. Let us then speak on this point what and how we can, let us comprehend it. But if we have not ability to comprehend even this, in 			 respect of the Other what are we? Lo, ye are listening to me; I am speaking a word. If any one goes out from us, and is asked outside what is being done here, he answers, &#8220;The Bishop is speaking a word.&#8221; I am speaking a word of the Word. But what a word, of what a Word? A mortal word, of the Word Immortal; a changeable word, of the Word Unchangeable; a passing word of the Word Eternal. Nevertheless, consider my word. For I have told you already, the Word of God is Whole everywhere. See, I 			 am speaking a word to you; what I say reaches to all. Now that what I am saying might come to you all, did ye divide what I say? If I , were to feed you, to wish to fill not your minds, but your bodies, and to set loaves before you to be satisfied therewith; would ye not divide my loaves among you? Could my loaves come to every one of you? If they came to one only, the rest would have none. But now see, I am speaking, and ye all receive. Nay, not only all receive, but all receive it whole. It 			 comes whole to all, to each whole. O the marvels of my word! What then is the Word of God? Hear again. I have spoken; what I have spoken, has gone forth to you, and has not gone away from me. It has reached to you, and has not been separated from me. Before I spake, I had it, and ye had not; I spake, and ye began to have, and I lost nothing. O the marvel of my word! What then is the Word of God? From little things form conjectures of things great. Consider earthly things, laud the heavenly. I 			 am a creature, ye are creatures; and such great miracles are done with my word in my heart, in my mouth, in my voice, in your ears, in your hearts. What then is the Creator? O Lord, hear us. Make us, for that Thou hast made us. Make us good, for that Thou hast made us enlightened men. These white-robed, enlightened ones hear Thy word by me. For enlightened by Thy grace they stand before Thee. &#8220;This is the day which the Lord hath made.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3619"></A><A HREF="#fn_3619"><FONT SIZE="1">3620</FONT></A>
 Only let them labour, let them pray <A NAME="page_469"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 469</FONT></A> <a name="vii.lxxii-Page_469"></A>for this, that when these days shall have gone by, they may not become darkness, who have been made the light of the wonders and the blessings of God.</p>
