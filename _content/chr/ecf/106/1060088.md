<span id="vi.iv.xxviii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.xxviii-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXVIII.—Of the Predicted Rejection
of Idols.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.xxviii-p2"></span>43. It cannot be questioned that what
was predicted at sundry times by His prophets is now being
realized,—namely, the announcement that He would disclaim His impious
people (not, indeed, the people as a whole, because even of the
Israelites many have believed in Christ; for His apostles themselves
belonged to that nation), and would humble every proud and injurious
person, so that He should Himself alone be exalted, that is to say,
alone be manifested to men as lofty and mighty; until idols should be
cast away by those who believe, and be concealed by those who believe
not; when the earth is broken by His fear, that is to say, when the men
of <span id="page_95">p. 95</span> <span
id="vi.iv.xxviii-Page_95"></span>earth are subdued by fear, to wit, by
fearing His law, or the law of those who, being at once believers in His
name and rulers among the nations, shall interdict such sacrilegious
practices.

<span id="vi.iv.xxviii-p3"></span>44. For these things, which I have
thus briefly stated in the way of introduction, and with a view to their
readier apprehension, are thus expressed by the prophet: And now, O
house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord. For
He has disclaimed His people the house of Israel, because the country
was replenished, as from the beginning, with their soothsayings as with
those of strangers, and many strange children were born to them. For
their country was replenished with silver and gold, neither was there
any numbering of their treasures; their land also is full of horses,
neither was there any numbering of their chariots: their land also is
full of the abominations of the works of their own hands, and they have
worshipped that which their own fingers have made. And the mean
man <span id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620) has bowed himself, and the
great man <span id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621) has humbled himself;
and I will not forgive it them. And now enter ye into the rocks, and
hide yourselves in the earth from before the fear of the Lord, and from
the majesty of His power, when He arises to crush the earth: for the
eyes of the Lord are lofty, and man is low; and the haughtiness of men
shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For
the day of the Lord of Hosts shall be upon every one that is injurious
and proud, and upon every one that is lifted up and humbled, <span
id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622) and they shall be brought low; and
upon every cedar of Lebanon of the high ones and the lifted up, <span
id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623) and upon every tree of the Lebanon of
Bashan, <span id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624) and upon every mountain,
and upon every high hill, <span id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625) and
upon every ship of the sea, and upon every spectacle of the beauty of
ships. And the contumely of men shall be humbled and shall fall, and the
Lord alone shall be exalted in that day; <span
id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626) and all things made by hands they
shall hide in dens, and in holes of the rocks, and in caves of the
earth, from before the fear of the Lord, and from the majesty of His
power, when He arises to crush the earth: for in that day a man shall
cast away the abominations of gold and silver, the vain and evil things
which they made for worship, in order to go into the clefts of the solid
rock, and into the holes of the rocks, from before the fear of the Lord,
and from the majesty of His power, when He arises to break the earth in
pieces. <span id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627)

elatorum*, which is given by the <span class="c13"><span

LXX. <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxviii-p7.2"></span>ὑψηλῶν και

Every high and elevated cedar of Lebanon.

the <span class="Greek"><span id="vi.iv.xxviii-p8.2"></span>
