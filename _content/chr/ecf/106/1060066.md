<span id="vi.iv.vi-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>Chapter VI.—Of the Four Living Creatures in
the Apocalypse, Which Have Been Taken by Some in One Application, and by
Others in Another, as Apt Figures of the Four Evangelists.</span>

<span id="vi.iv.vi-p2"></span>9. For these reasons, it also appears to
me, that of the various parties who have interpreted the living
creatures in the Apocalypse as significant of the four evangelists,
those who have taken the lion to point to Matthew, the man to Mark, the
calf to Luke, and the eagle to John, have made a more reasonable
application of the figures than those who have assigned the man to
Matthew, the eagle to Mark, and the lion to John. <span
id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533) For, in forming their particular idea
of <span id="page_81">p. 81</span> <span
id="vi.iv.vi-Page_81"></span>the matter, these latter have chosen to
keep in view simply the beginnings of the books, and not the full design
of the several evangelists in its completeness, which was the matter
that should, above all, have been thoroughly examined. For surely it is
with much greater propriety that the one who has brought under our
notice most largely the kingly character of Christ, should be taken to
be represented by the lion. Thus is it also that we find the lion
mentioned in conjunction with the royal tribe itself, in that passage of
the Apocalypse where it is said, “The lion of the tribe of Judah hath
prevailed.” <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534) For in Matthew’s
narrative the magi are recorded to have come from the east to inquire
after the King, and to worship Him whose birth was notified to them by
the star. Thus, too, Herod, who himself also was a king, is \[said there
to be\] afraid of the royal child, and to put so many little children to
death in order to make sure that the one might be slain. <span
id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535) Again, that Luke is intended under the
figure of the calf, in reference to the pre-eminent sacrifice made by
the priest, has been doubted by neither of the two \[sets of
interpreters\]. For in that Gospel the narrator’s account commences with
Zacharias the priest. In it mention is also made of the relationship
between Mary and Elisabeth. <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536) In
it, too, it is recorded that the ceremonies proper to the earliest
priestly service were attended to in the case of the infant
Christ; <span id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537) and a careful
examination brings a variety of other matters under our notice in this
Gospel, by which it is made apparent that Luke’s object was to deal with
the part of the priest. In this way it follows further, that Mark, who
has set himself neither to give an account of the kingly lineage, nor to
expound anything distinctive of the priesthood, whether on the subject
of the relationship or on that of the consecration, and who at the same
time comes before us as one who handles the things which the man Christ
did, appears to be indicated simply under the figure of the man among
those four living creatures. But again, those three living creatures,
whether lion, man, or calf, have their course upon this earth; and in
like manner, those three evangelists occupy themselves chiefly with the
things which Christ did in the flesh, and with the precepts which He
delivered to men, who also bear the burden of the flesh, for their
instruction in the rightful exercise of this mortal life. Whereas John,
on the other hand, soars like an eagle above the clouds of human
infirmity, and gazes upon the light of the unchangeable truth with those
keenest and steadiest eyes of the heart. <span
