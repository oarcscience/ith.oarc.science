<span id="vi.v.xxx-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.xxx-p1.1"></span>Chapter XXIX.—Of the Two Blind Men and the
Dumb Demoniac Whose Stories are Related Only by Matthew.</span>

<span id="vi.v.xxx-p2"></span>69. Matthew proceeds with his narrative in
the following terms: “And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men
followed Him, crying and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us;”
and so on, down to the verse where we read, “But the Pharisees said, He
casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.” <span
id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958) Matthew is the only one who introduces
this account of the two blind men and the dumb demoniac. For those two
blind men, whose story is given also by the others, <span
id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959) are not the two before us here.
Nevertheless there is such similarity in the occurrences, that if
Matthew himself had not recorded the latter incident as well as the
former, it might have been thought that the one which he relates at
present has also been given by these other two evangelists. There is
this fact, therefore, which we ought to bear carefully in mind,—namely,
that there are some occurrences which resemble each other. For we have a
proof of this in the circumstance that the very same evangelist mentions
both incidents here. And thus, if at any time we find any such
occurrences narrated individually by the several evangelists, and
discover some contradiction in the accounts, which seems not to admit of
being solved \[on the principle of harmonizing\], it may occur to us
that the explanation simply is, that this \[apparently contradictory\]
circumstance did not take place \[on that particular occasion\], but
that what did happen then was only something resembling it, or something
which was gone about in a similar manner.
