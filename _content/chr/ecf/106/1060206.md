<span id="vi.vii.i-p2"></span>1. As we have examined Matthew’s narrative
in its complete connection, and as the comparison which we have carried
out between it and the other three on to its conclusion has established
the fact, that not one of these evangelists contains anything either at
variance with other statements in his own Gospel, or inconsistent with
the accounts presented by his fellow-historians, let us now subject Mark
to a similar scrutiny. Our plan will be to omit those sections which he
has in common with Matthew, which we have already investigated as far as
seemed requisite and are now done with, and to take up those paragraphs
which remain, with the view of submitting them to discussion and
comparison, and of demonstrating their thorough harmony with what is
related by the other evangelists on to the notice of the Lord’s Supper.
For we have already dealt with all the incidents which are reported in
all the four Gospels from that point on to the end, and have considered
the subject of their mutual consistency.
