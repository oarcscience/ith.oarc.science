<span id="vi.vii.iii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>Chapter II.—Of the Man Out of Whom the
Unclean Spirit that Was Tormenting Him Was Cast, and of the Question
Whether Mark’s Version is Quite Consistent with that of Luke, Who is at
One with Him in Reporting the Incident.</span>

<span id="vi.vii.iii-p2"></span>3. Mark proceeds with his narrative in
the following terms: “And they were astonished at His doctrine: for He
taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. And there
was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit: and he cried out,
saying, <span id="fr_1588"></span>[1589](#fn_1588) What have we to do
with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us?” and so
on, down to the passage where we read, “And He preached in the
synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.” <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[1590](#fn_1589) Although there are some points here
which are common only to Mark and Luke, the entire contents of this
section have also been already dealt with when we were going over
Matthew’s narrative in its continuity. For all these matters came into
the order of narration in such a manner that I thought they could not be
passed over. But Luke says that this unclean spirit went out of the man
in such a way as not to hurt him: whereas Mark’s statement is to this
effect: “And the unclean spirit cometh out of him, tearing him, and
crying with a loud voice.” There may seem, therefore, to be some
discrepancy here. For how could the unclean spirit have been “tearing
him,” or, as some codices have it, “tormenting him,” if, as Luke says,
he “hurt him not”? Luke, however, gives the notice in full, thus: “And
when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and
“hurt him not.” <span id="fr_1590"></span>[1591](#fn_1590) Thus we are
to understand that when Mark says, “tormenting him,” he just refers to
what Luke expresses in the sentence, “When he had thrown him in the
midst.” And when the latter appends the words, “and hurt him not,” the
meaning simply is, that the said tossing of the man’s limbs and
tormenting him did not debilitate him, as is often the case with the
exit of devils, when, at times, some of <span id="page_226">p.
226</span> <span id="vi.vii.iii-Page_226"></span>the members are even
destroyed  <span id="fr_1591"></span>[1592](#fn_1591) in the process of
removing the trouble.
