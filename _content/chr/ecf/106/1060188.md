<span id="vi.vi.x-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.vi.x-p1.1"></span>Chapter IX.—Of the Mockery Which He Sustained
at the Hands of Pilate’s Cohort, and of the Harmony Subsisting Among the
Three Evangelists Who Report that Scene, Namely, Matthew, Mark, and
John.</span>

<span id="vi.vi.x-p2"></span>36. We have now reached the point at which
we may study the Lord’s passion, strictly so called, as it is presented
in the narrative of these four evangelists. Matthew commences his
account as follows: “Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into
the common hall, and gathered unto Him the whole band of soldiers. And
they stripped Him, and put on Him a scarlet robe. And when they had
platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon His head, and a reed in His
right hand: and they bowed the knee before Him, and mocked Him, saying,
Hail, King of the Jews!” <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1368](#fn_1367) At
the same stage in the narrative, Mark delivers himself thus: “And the
soldiers led Him away into the hall <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>
<span id="vi.vi.x-Page_196"></span>called Prætorium; and they called
together the whole band. And they clothed Him with purple, and platted a
crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and began to salute Him,
saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they smote Him on the head with a
reed, and did spit upon Him, and, bowing their knees, worshipped Him.”
 <span id="fr_1368"></span>[1369](#fn_1368) Here, therefore, we perceive
that while Matthew tells us how they “put on Him a scarlet robe,” Mark
speaks of purple, with which He was clothed. The explanation may be that
the said scarlet robe was employed instead of the royal purple by these
scoffers. There is also a certain red-coloured purple which resembles
scarlet very closely. And it may also be the case that Mark has noticed
the purple which the robe contained, although it was properly scarlet.
Luke has left this without mention. On the other hand, previous to
stating how Pilate delivered Him up to be crucified, John has introduced
the following passage: “Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged
Him. And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on His head,
and they put on Him a purple robe, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And
they smote Him with their hands.” <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1370](#fn_1369) This makes it evident that Matthew
and Mark have reported this incident in the way of a recapitulation, and
that it did not actually take place after Pilate had delivered Him up to
be crucified. For John informs us distinctly enough that these things
took place when He yet was with Pilate. Hence we conclude that the other
evangelists have introduced the occurrence at that particular point,
just because, having previously passed it by, they recollected it there.
This is also borne out by what Matthew proceeds next to relate. He
continues thus: “And they spit upon Him, and took the reed, and smote
Him on the head. And after that they had mocked Him, they took the robe
off from Him, and put His own raiment on Him, and led Him away to
crucify Him.” <span id="fr_1370"></span>[1371](#fn_1370) Here we are
given to understand that the taking the robe off Him and the clothing
Him with His own raiment were done at the close, when He was being led
away. This is given by Mark, as follows: “And when they had mocked Him,
they took off the purple from Him, and put His own clothes on
Him.” <span id="fr_1371"></span>[1372](#fn_1371)
