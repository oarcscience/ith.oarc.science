<span id="vi.v.lxxvii-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.lxxvii-p1.1"></span>Chapter LXXVI.—Of the Harmony in Respect of
the Order of Narration Subsisting Between Matthew and the Other Two
Evangelists in the Accounts Given of the Occasion on Which He Foretold
the Destruction of the Temple.</span>

<span id="vi.v.lxxvii-p2"></span>146. Matthew proceeds with his history
in the following terms: “And Jesus went out and departed from the
temple; and His disciples came to Him for to show Him the buildings of
the temple. And Jesus said unto them, See ye all these things? Verily I
say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another which
shall not be thrown down.” <span id="fr_1184"></span>[1185](#fn_1184)
This incident is related also by Mark, and nearly in the same order. But
he brings it in after a digression of some small extent, which is made
with a view to mention the case of the widow who put the two mites into
the treasury, <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1186](#fn_1185) which
occurrence is recorded only by Mark and Luke. For \[in proof that Mark’s
order is essentially the same as Matthew’s, we need only notice that\]
in Mark’s version also, after the account of the Lord’s discussion with
the Jews on the occasion when He asked them how they held Christ to be
David’s son, we have a narrative of what He said in warning them against
the Pharisees and their hypocrisy,—a section which Matthew has presented
on the amplest scale, introducing into it a larger number of the Lord’s
sayings on that occasion. Then after this paragraph, which has been
handled briefly by Mark, and treated with great fulness by Matthew,
Mark, as I have said, introduces the passage about the widow who was at
once so extremely poor, and yet abounded so remarkably. And finally,
without interpolating anything else, he subjoins a section in which he
comes again into unison with Matthew,—namely, that relating to the
destruction of the temple. In like manner, Luke first states the
question which was propounded regarding Christ, as to how He was the son
of David, and then mentions a few of the words which were spoken in
cautioning them against the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. Thereafter he
proceeds, as Mark does, to tell the story of the widow who cast the two
mites into the treasury. And finally he appends the statement, <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[1187](#fn_1186) which appears also in Matthew and
Mark, on the subject of the destined overthrow of the temple. <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[1188](#fn_1187)

coming.”
