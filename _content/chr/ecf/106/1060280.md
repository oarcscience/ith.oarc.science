<span id="vii.lxiii-p1"></span><span class="c37"><span
id="vii.lxiii-p1.1"></span>Sermon LXI.</span>

<span id="vii.lxiii-p2"></span><span class="c4"><span
id="vii.lxiii-p2.1"></span>\[CXI. Ben.\]</span>

<span id="vii.lxiii-p3"></span>*On the words of the Gospel,* [Luke
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#021),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#023)<span
id="vii.lxiii-p3.1"></span>*[Luke xiii.
21](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#021)<span id="vii.lxiii-p3.2"></span>
and 23, where the kingdom of God is said to be “like unto leaven, which
a woman took and hid in three measures of meal;” and of that which is
written in the same chapter, “Lord, are they few that are saved?”*

<span id="vii.lxiii-p4"></span>1. “<span class="c13"><span
id="vii.lxiii-p4.1"></span>The</span> three measures of meal” <span
id="fr_3460"></span>[3461](#fn_3460) of which the Lord spake, is the
human race. Recollect the deluge; three only remained, from whom the
rest were to be re-peopled. Noe had three sons, by them was repaired the
human race. That holy “woman who hid the leaven,” is Wisdom. Lo, the
whole world crieth out in the Church of God, “I know that the Lord is
great.” <span id="fr_3461"></span>[3462](#fn_3461) Yet doubtless there
are but few who are saved. Ye remember a question which was lately set
before us out of the Gospel, “Lord,” it was said, “are there few that be
saved?” <span id="fr_3462"></span>[3463](#fn_3462) What said the Lord
<span id="page_446">p. 446</span> <span
id="vii.lxiii-Page_446"></span>to this? He did not say, “Not few, but
many are they who are saved.” He did not say this. But what said He,
when He had heard, “Are there few that be saved? Strive to enter by the
strait gate.” <span id="fr_3463"></span>[3464](#fn_3463) When thou
hearest then, “Are there few that be saved?” the Lord confirmed what He
heard. Through the “strait gate” but “few” can “enter.” In another place
He saith Himself, “Strait and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life,
and few there be that go thereby: but broad and spacious is the way that
leadeth to destruction, and many there be which walk thereby.” <span
id="fr_3464"></span>[3465](#fn_3464) Why rejoice we in great numbers?
Give ear to me, ye “few.” I know that ye are “many,” who hear me, yet
but “few” of you hear to obey. I see the floor, I look for the corn. And
hardly is the corn seen, when the floor is being threshed; but the time
is coming, that it shall be winnowed. But few then are saved in
comparison of the many that shall perish. For these same “few” will
constitute in themselves a great mass. When the Winnower shall come with
His fan in His Hand, “He will cleanse His floor, and lay up the wheat
into the garner; but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable
fire.” <span id="fr_3465"></span>[3466](#fn_3465) Let not the chaff
scoff at the wheat; in this He speaketh truth, and deceiveth no one. Be
ye then in yourselves among many a many, few though ye be in comparison
of a certain many. So large a mass is to come out of this floor, as to
fill the garner of heaven. For the Lord Christ would not contradict
Himself, who hath said, “Many there are who enter in by the narrow gate,
many who go to ruin through the wide gate;” contradict Himself, who hath
in another place said, “Many shall come from the East and West.” <span
id="fr_3466"></span>[3467](#fn_3466) “Many” then are the “few;” both
“few” and “many.” Are the “few” one sort, and the “many” another? No.
But the “few” are themselves the “many;” “few” in comparison of the
lost, “many in the society of the Angels. Hearken, dearly Beloved. The
Apocalypse hath this written; “After this I beheld of all languages, and
nations, and tribes, a great multitude, which no man can number, coming
with white robes and palms.”  <span id="fr_3467"></span>[3468](#fn_3467)
This is the mass of the saints. With how much clearer voice will the
floor say, when it has been fanned, separated from the crowd of ungodly,
and evil, and false Christians, when those who “press” and do not
“touch” (for a certain woman in the Gospel “touched,” the crowd
“pressed” Christ), shall have been severed unto everlasting fire; when
all they then, who are to be damned shall have been separated off, with
how great assurance will the purified mass, standing at the Right Hand,
fearing now for itself the admixture of no evil men, nor the loss of any
of the good, now about to reign with Christ, say, “I know that the Lord
is great”! <span id="fr_3468"></span>[3469](#fn_3468)

<span id="vii.lxiii-p14"></span>2. If then, my Brethren (I am speaking
to the corn), if they acknowledge what I say, predestined unto life
eternal, let them speak by their works, not by their voices. I am
constrained to speak to you, what I ought not. For I ought to find in
you matter of praise, not to seek subjects for admonition. Yet see I
will say but a few words, I will not dwell upon it. Acknowledge the duty
of hospitality, thereby some have attained unto God. Thou takest in some
stranger, whose companion in the way thou thyself also art; for
strangers are we all. He is a Christian who, even in his own house and
in his own country, acknowledges himself to be a stranger. For our
country is above, there we shall not be strangers. For every one here
below, even in his own house, is a stranger. If he be not a stranger,
let him not pass on from hence. If pass on he must, he is a stranger.
Let him not deceive himself, a stranger he is; whether he will or not,
he is a stranger. And he leaves that house to his children, one stranger
to other strangers. Why? If thou wert at an inn, wouldest thou not
depart when another comes? The same thou doest even in thine own house.
Thy father left a place to thee, thou wilt some day leave it to thy
children. Neither dost thou abide here, as one who is to abide always,
nor to those who are so to abide, wilt thou leave it. If we are all
passing away, let us do something which cannot pass away, that when we
shall have passed away, and have come thither whence we may not pass
away, we may find our good works there. Christ is the keeper, why dost
thou fear lest thou shouldest lose what thou spendest on the poor? “Let
us turn to the Lord,” etc.

<span id="vii.lxiii-p15"></span>And after the Sermon.

<span id="vii.lxiii-p16"></span>I suggest to you, Beloved, what ye know
already. To-morrow breaks the anniversary day of the venerable <span
id="fr_3469"></span>[3470](#fn_3469) lord Aurelius’ ordination; he asks
and admonishes you, dear Brethren, by my humble ministry, that ye would
be so good <span id="fr_3470"></span>[3471](#fn_3470) as to meet
together with all devotion at the basilica of Faustus. Thanks be to God.
