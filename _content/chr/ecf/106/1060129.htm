<p class="c39"><a name="vi.v.xxxiii-p1"></A> <span class="c2"><a name="vi.v.xxxiii-p1.1"></A>Chapter XXXII.&#8212;Of the Occasion on Which He Upbraided the Cities Because They Repented Not, Which Incident is Recorded by Luke as Well as by Matthew; And of the Question Regarding Matthew&#146;s Harmony with Luke in the Matter of the Order.</span></p>  			 
<p class="c22"><a name="vi.v.xxxiii-p2"></A>79. Thereafter Matthew goes on as follows: &#8220;Then began He to upbraid the cities wherein most of His mighty works were done, because they repented not;&#8221; and so on, down to where we read, &#8220;It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom at the day of judgment, than for you.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_993"></A><A HREF="#fn_993"><FONT SIZE="1">994</FONT></A>
 This section likewise is given by Luke, who reports it also as an utterence from the lips of the Lord in connection with a certain continuous <A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A> <a name="vi.v.xxxiii-Page_140"></A>discourse which He delivered. This circumstance makes it the rather appear that Luke has recorded these words in the strict consecution in which they were spoken by the Lord, while Matthew has kept by the order of his own recollections. Or if it is supposed that Matthew&#146;s words, &#8220;Then began He to upbraid 				the cities,&#8221; must be taken in such a way as to imply that the intention was to express, by the term &#8220;then,&#8221; the precise point of time at which the saying was uttered, and not to signify in a somewhat broader way the period at which many of these things were done and spoken, then I say that any one entertaining that idea may equally well believe these sentences to have been pronounced on two different occasions. For if it is the fact that even in one and the same evangelist some things are 				found which the Lord utters twice over, as is the case with this very Luke in the instance of the counsel not to take a scrip for the journey, and so with other things in like manner which we find to have been spoken by the Lord in two different places,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_994"></A><A HREF="#fn_994"><FONT SIZE="1">995</FONT></A>
&#8212;why should it seem strange if some other word of the Lord, which was originally uttered on two separate occasions, may happen also to be recorded by two several evangelists, each of whom gives it in the order in which it was actually spoken, and if thus the order seems to be different in the two, simply because the sentences were uttered both on the occasion noticed by the one, and on that referred to by the other?</p>
