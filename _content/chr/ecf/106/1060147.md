<span id="vi.v.li-p1"></span> <span class="c2"><span
id="vi.v.li-p1.1"></span>Chapter L.—Of the Occasion on Which He Fed the
Multitudes with the Seven Loaves, and of the Question as to the Harmony
Between Matthew and Mark in Their Accounts of that Miracle.</span>

<span id="vi.v.li-p2"></span>104. Matthew proceeds with his narrative in
the following terms: “And when Jesus had departed from thence, He came
nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down
there. And great multitudes came unto Him, having with them those that
were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at
Jesus’ feet, and He healed them; insomuch that the multitudes wondered,
when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to
walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. Then
Jesus called His disciples unto Him, and said, I have compassion on the
multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have
nothing to eat,” and so on, down to the words, “And they that did eat
were four thousand men, besides women and children.” <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[1075](#fn_1074) This other miracle of the seven
loaves and the few little fishes is recorded also by Mark, and that too
in almost the same order; the exception being that he inserts before it
a narrative given by no other,—namely, that relating to the deaf man
whose ears the Lord opened, when He spat and said, “Effeta,” that is, Be
opened. <span id="fr_1075"></span>[1076](#fn_1075)

<span id="vi.v.li-p5"></span>105. In the case of this miracle of the
seven loaves, it is certainly not a superfluous task to call attention
to the fact that these two evangelists, Matthew and Mark, have thus
introduced it into their narrative. For if one of them had recorded this
miracle, who at the same time had taken no notice of the instance of the
five loaves, he would have been judged to stand opposed to the rest. For
in such circumstances, who would not have supposed that there was only
the one miracle wrought in actual fact, and that an incomplete and
unveracious version of it had been given by the writer referred to,
<span id="page_153">p. 153</span> <span id="vi.v.li-Page_153"></span>or
by the others, or by all of them together; so \[that we must have
imagined\] either that the one evangelist, by a mistake on his own part,
had been led to mention seven loaves instead of five; or that the other
two, whether as having both presented an incorrect statement, or as
having been misled through a slip of memory, had put the number five for
the number seven. In like manner, it might have been supposed that there
was a contradiction between the twelve baskets <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[1077](#fn_1076) and the seven baskets, <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1078](#fn_1077) and again, between the five
thousand and the four thousand, expressing the numbers of those who were
fed. But now, since those evangelists who have given us the account of
the miracle of the seven loaves have also not failed to mention the
other miracle of the five loaves, no difficulty can be felt by any one,
and all can see that both works were really wrought. This, accordingly,
we have instanced, in order that, if in any other passage we come upon
some similar deed of the Lord’s, which, as told by one evangelist, seems
so utterly contrary to the version of it given by another that no method
of solving the difficulty can possibly be found, we may understand the
explanation to be simply this, that both incidents really took place,
and that they were recorded separately by the two several writers. This
is precisely what we have already recommended to attention in the matter
of the seating of the multitudes by hundreds and by fifties. For were it
not for the circumstance that both these numbers are found noted by the
one historian, we might have supposed that the different writers had
made contradictory statements. <span
